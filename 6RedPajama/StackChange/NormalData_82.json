["Q: Monterey: mirror iPad screen on Mac in separate window It seems that now it is possible to mirror an iPad/iPhone screen on your mac over wifi connection. However, if you do this, you cannot do anything esle on your mac, just watch the screen. My question is whether it is possible to mirror the screen in a separate window.\nUp until now, I did it by connecting iPad through a cable, opening QuickTime player, selecting New movie recording, and selecting iPad. This did the job. The advantage is that I can share screen of my mac in an online conference and I can show my iPad screen next to something else. I thought that now it will be possible to do this wirelessly.\nAm I just not seeing something or is it still not possible with Monterey?\n\nA: As of 12.0.1 macOS Monterey only supports receiving AirPlay video fullscreen (and oddly enough, it also turns every other screen that is connected black).\nIf you want to receive AirPlay video in a window there is 3rd party software to accomplish this (LonelyScreen, AirServer, Reflector, ...)\n\nA: LetsView is the name of the app you're looking for.\nIt's a free alternative to the famous Reflector app.\nIt allows you to mirror the iPad screen on Mac in a separate window.\nPersonally tested with MBP M1 Pro with iPad Air (5th Gen, M1).\n", "Q: After updating to Monterey, Firefox fonts are broken I've just updated my mac to Monterey and after that I found out that font is just different that it used to be before the update - the tab title is quite small and fonts on websites are both different and missized:\n\n\nIt seems the FF option Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above is not working anymore as from what I understand it should load website based fonts instead of the one you select in FF settings (I have it checked obviously). I haven't try to reinstall the FF yet but maybe there is a way to fix it without doing so?\nI use Macbook Air with M1 chip.\n\nA: As explained in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715898#c5 this bug currently occurs if macOS 12 has a non-english primary language set. As a workaround the primary language can be set to English in System Preferences (at least in my case no reboot was required, it was enough to restart Firefox afterwards).\n", "Q: High Impedance headphone support from the new Headphone Jack on the 2021 MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\"? The apple website says the new MacBook pros 2021 both the 14\" and the 16\" with the added ports has also improved the 3.5 mm headphone jack(internal DAC to be more precise) with advanced support for high-impedance headphones.\nUnfortunately the specifications of which are nowhere to be found at time of product release.\nWhat kind of audio system setup can this internal DAC compete with, does is entirely eliminate the need for a basic DAC-AMP setup or is it just a little bit better and aimed for the use-case of traveling.\nWhat range of audio drivers can this power.\n\nA: The 3.5 mm headphone jack on the MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) or MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) features DC load detection and adaptive voltage output. Mac can detect the impedance of the connected device and will adapt its output for low- and high-impedance headphones, as well as for line-level audio devices.\nWhen connected headphones with an impedance of less than 150 ohms, the headphone jack provides up to 1.25 volts RMS. For headphones with an impedance of 150 to 1k ohms, the headphone jack delivers 3 volts RMS. This may remove the need for an external headphone amplifier.\nThe built-in digital-to-analog converter supports sample rates of up to 96 kHz.\nReference : Apple Support - Use high-impedance headphones with new MacBook Pro models\nUpdate\nAfter seeing the reviews & tests that have come out, it seems like the quality has not improved much from the older generations just the fact that it can now drive higher impedance headphones and give better volume output. This is unfortunate and thus won't eliminate the need for a good external DAC(Digital to Analog converter) & AMP(Amplifier) for a good Hi-Fi(High fidelity) audio system.\n", "Q: Do Apple provide a service to substitute MacBook key caps? I would like to buy a used MacBook, but in the region I am located they are mainly sold in a different keyboard layout than the one I am used to. Can I ask apple to substitute the key caps for me (of course for a fee)?\n\nA: *\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794\nApple keyboards are physically different when you specify them at the time of order. Apple does not change out the layout as a service offering. They will repair a damaged keyboard or worn one in a way that you get the warranty on all Apple Authorized service, but this doesn’t include a transplant of a different layout than what was purchased.\nI would budget for a new Apple Bluetooth keyboard in your purchase plans in case you can’t get used to the different layout and a wired one isn’t amenable to your workspace layout.\nIt takes me three weeks to get used to a new layout and mistakes abound and it never truly feels right for far longer, so if your brain works like mine, you’ll be unhappy if you need the key labels to match the layout until you’re rewired your typing expectations.\n", "Q: \"which\" command returns paths with two consecutive slashes On my macOS machine, I noticed that sometimes the which command returns paths with two consecutive slashes. For example:\nbash-3.2$ which gcc\n/usr/local/bin//gcc\nbash-3.2$ which qr\n/Users/flyingblu/bin//qr\n\nHowever, for some programs which returns normal paths.\nbash-3.2$ which bash\n/bin/bash\nbash-3.2$ which which\n/usr/bin/which\n\nI tried these commands in both bash and zsh, and their outcomes are the same. \nI have never seen this in Linux systems, what is the reason for the two consecutive slashes?\n\nA: It looks like that you need to make the directories in $PATH not have a trailing /\nie you has /usr/local/bin/ in your path and it should be  /usr/local/bin\n", "Q: Why do I have to keep reloading the SSH daemon? This on a 2017 iMac running Big Sur (11.6) with OpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3.\nI sometimes have a need to log in to this machine remotely. I have forwarded the port appropriately.\nBut, sometimes I get a \"connection refused\" error. This can be remedied by the following:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\n\nIf I'm away home, there's no way for me to run this. So, I'm trying to find out why reloading the daemon is necessary and if there's anything I can do to keep the daemon running.\n\nA: I believe I figured this out. At home I have a dynamic IP address for which I use a dynamic DNS service. That dynamic IP changes several times per day. The machines to which I want to connect via ssh are behind a double NAT. To overcome the double NAT I set those machines up with an ssh tunnel back to my home machine. That tunnel depends on knowing the IP address of the home machine. When the home IP address changes, the tunnel fails. It can only re-establish itself when the dynamic DNS service is updated. Sometimes that is slow. That can make it appear that ssh is not working. Reloading the ssh daemon probably has nothing to do with it. It's all about having the patience to wait for the dynamic IP update.\n", "Q: What is the ~/Applications directory for? I was asked by tech support to run the command ls -l ~/Applications and found the directory (/Users/<me>/Applications) to be empty. All my applications seem to actually be in /Applications.\nI'm not very familiar with the Mac file-system; is this normal? Why do I have two applications directories anyway?\n\nA: An Applications directory in your user's home directory is not a standard directory, but some users create and use them. If you have it, either you, someone else, or some script created it.\nIn older versions of macOS, it usually does not matter much where you store your app; they are location independent. It often even happened (and still happens) that users downloaded disk images (.dmg) and ran the contained applications from that image, not being aware that the app is not stored in a \"normal\" volume. So instead of copying an app to /Applications (which requires administrator privileges and makes the app available to all users on the system), some users prefer or preferred to store their apps in a folder in their home directory. A natural choice for that is to create an Applications folder.\nNowadays, some OS restrictions may require you to store the app in /Applications. App Store managed apps live there, and apps that have a System Extension must also be stored there (or else the System Extension cannot get activated; the reasons for that are a bit complicated and relate to the OS' need to manage the System Extensions and keep track of their \"parent\" apps).\n\nA: Each user account has its own Library folder (which includes the Applications folder), in addition to accessing the machine-wide Library folder. Software installed by an administrator is available to all user accounts from the machine-wide Library folder. However, software installed by users (assuming they can get admin authentication to do so) will be installed in the user-specific Library folder. This means that software with a one-user licence can be installed for that user but it will not be available to other (unlicensed) users.\n", "Q: How to write defaults value from a file as bytes? How to save content of a file into via defaults in such a way that they are handled as -data type?\nIn fact, I am searching for a command line alternative for this obj-c code:\nNSData *data = // ... get the data\nNSUserDefaults *userDefaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];\n[userDefaults setObject:data forKey:@\"mykey\"];\n\nWhen I call defaults read on that key I get:\n% defaults read mydomain mykey\n{length = 400, bytes = 0xdcf2dbbb cb4343d7 ec4324ae 1234de18 ... 289f4567 ec4324ae }\n\nLater in an obj-c app, the data are read using:\nNSUserDefaults *userDefaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];\nNSData *data = [userDefaults dataForKey:@\"mykey\"];\n\nEven I have no idea what the right approach to mimic setting the key is, I presume it might be something like:\n% FILEDATA=... # read abc.xyz into a variable\n% defaults write mydomain mykey -data \"$FILEDATA\" # save into user data\n\n\nA: Using the defaults command in Terminal, the following is a simple example of writing a key containing data as its value to a PLIST file:\n% data='5468697320697320612064756D6D7920656E74727921'\n% defaults write ~/Desktop/my.dummy.plist 'foobar' -data \"$data\"\n% defaults read ~/Desktop/my.dummy.plist foobar           \n{length = 22, bytes = 0x5468697320697320612064756d6d7920656e74727921}\n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'print foobar' ~/Desktop/my.dummy.plist   \nThis is a dummy entry!\n% \n\nTo convert the contents of a file to hex data suitable for use with the defaults command, use the following:\n% data=\"$(xxd -p '/path/to/file' | tr -d '\\n')\"\n\nOr in place of \"$data\" in the example defaults command, replace it with:\n\"$(xxd -p '/path/to/file' | tr -d '\\n')\"\n\nExample:\ndefaults write ~/Desktop/my.dummy.plist 'foobar' -data \"$(xxd -p '/path/to/file' | tr -d '\\n')\"\n\nNotes:\nThis syntax also works:\ndata='<5468697320697320612064756D6D7920656E74727921>'\ndefaults write ~/Desktop/my.dummy.plist 'foobar' \"$data\"\n\nNote that < and > are used as part of data and the -data option was not used for the value type of the target key in the defaults command.\nThe hex data used in the example was created using the following command to convert the text string to hex data:\n% xxd -p -u <<< 'This is a dummy entry!'\n5468697320697320612064756D6D7920656E747279210A\n% \n\nThe use of the -u option with the xxd command is not absolutely necessary. I just like to see upper case hex data in the example.\nAfter writing the data to a PLIST file in the first example further above, I use PlistBuddy to read the value of the target key.  Keep in mind that in this simple example the value of foobar is just a text string and it outputs the converted hex data as shown, however, if the value of the data in the target key is e.g. a binary PLIST file itself or other binary data, the output isn't going to be pretty.\n", "Q: How to remove \"quick view / quick preview\" area from finder window? How can i remove / hide the \"quick view / quick preview\" area from finder (see markup attached) ?\nIm running Big Sur, but I think Ive seen this area in previous versions of MacOS / OSX also.\n\n\nA: You can use Shift+Cmd+P shortcut for that. It's in the View drop-down menu as well, as \"Show preview\" or something like that (I use macOS in PT-BR, so not sure about EN-US).\n", "Q: Opening PDFs in the same window using Preview not working with Monterey? On Big Sur, I had no issues opening multiple PDFs in tabs under the same Preview window. However, ever since I upgraded to Monterey, Preview seems to be opening separate windows for each PDF I open. Is anyone else experiencing this problem and found a fix for it yet? I have checked Settings > General and my \"Prefer tabs\" says \"always\", just as it did when I was on Big Sur, so I assume it is a bug in Monterey.\nI also know that I can \"forcefully\" merge all windows when I am actually in Preview, but I am talking about having this automatically done when I open multiple PDFs, which was possible until Big Sur.\nP.S. Not sure whether this is relevant, but I am using an M1 iMac.\n\nA: Preview on macOS Monterey is virtually broken in terms of saving and respecting user preferences, so I can state that I am able to reproduce this bug even on an Intel iMac, so this is not a question of CPU. It does not respect the zoom to fit preference either and now I have also to activate that viewing preference every time I open a PDF document. Please file a bug through Feedback Assistant. I will too, because the more feedback they get this bug will get a higher priority to be fixed.\n", "Q: Why is my old phone still listed on my iCloud account? Recently I followed the on-device steps for resetting my iPhone and preparing to give it to someone else. But after completing the process, my iPhone still appears in the list of devices associated with my account. Why? Is there an essential step that isn't included in the on-device walkthrough? Years ago, before the on-device process was implemented it used to be necessary to start by signing out of iCloud on the old device. But this is not mentioned in the walkthrough, which in any case says that iCloud will be disabled.\nIs the sign out step still necessary even though it isn't part of the on-device process of wiping a phone? If so, what should I do now that I've wiped my old phone already without signing out of iCloud?\n\nA: There are two places you can remove your phone:\nFind My (iPhone): Removing it here removes Activation Lock and tracking capabilities\nApple ID Devices List: Removing it here removes it as an authorized device to login to your account. If you wipe the device, you still have to re-authorize it so it has minimal impact.\n\nYou did not miss a step or expose yourself to a security risk if you wiped it and removed it from Find My. You can safely remove it from any other lists you find it on going forward.\n", "Q: How can I avoid an error preparing macOS Monterey installation on a Mac with an OWC Aura Pro x2 SSD? I have a 1TB OWC Aura Pro X2 on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) model. I'm currently running macOS BigSur 11.6.1. When I tried to upgrade to macOS Monterey the update fails with a generic message saying:\nAn Error Occurred While Preparing the Installation ...\nIn the logs, I could find errors highlighting that the EFI drivers are outdated. I checked the OWC website and I could not find any firmware update matching the current macOS that I have. Any pointers on how to solve it?\n\nA: No me too ... I tried a fresh install also fails during boot time of Monterey.\nFirst did an install from Big Sur also an error when trying to shut down.\nPut back the original SSD, installed Monterey succesfully ;)\nThen placed the OWC Aura X2 pro back, the upgrade to Monterey did succeed, so also for me the procedure described in this chat worked.\nSo for everyone that still has the original SSD... this solves the issue ;)\n\nA: I may have a workaround to share that got me going...\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/253296956?answerId=256166114022#256166114022\n\nI ran into the same issue and contacted OWC to see if they had a firmware update available for my SSD.  Talking to support, they said that it isn't the SSD that requires the firmware update, but the MacBook Pro itself, which requires an EFI update that won't be installed unless there's an Apple SSD installed.  They recommended that I reinstall the original Apple SSD, then install Monterey to get the EFI update, then replace the Apple SSD with the OWC SSD, and upgrade from Big Sur 11.6.1 to Monterey.  According to OWC, they've tested this fix in their lab and it works.\n\n\nA: Use the original SSD.\nI confirm the following worked great for me on my 2015 MacBook Pro 15\".\n\n*\n\n*Installed original SSD.\n\n*Installed fresh copy of Monterey via the USB stick onto the original SSD (it rebooted a bunch of times, indicating a firmware update).\n\n*Put the new SSD back in.\n\n*Booted off USB stick and upgraded to Monterey without a hitch.\n\nIt sucks if you don't have your original SSD but maybe you can get a cheap one off of the interwebs. Doesn't have to be big. Likely doesn't even have to be the same one that came with your unit. Most likely just any genuine Apple SSD.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Swapping out my OWC drive for original Apple drive on my 13 inch early 2015 MBP did allow the update to complete. Once that was done I reinstalled the OWC drive and had no problems upgrading to Monterey.\n", "Q: Share screen from macOS Monterey I was waiting for FaceTime upgrades on macOS Monterey & iOS 15.1.\nOn iOS 15.1 I can share the screens, but I do not see the option on macOS Monterey, is there any settings which needs to be configured ?\n\nA: SharePlay for macOS is marked \"Coming later this fall.\" on the feature list.\nhttps://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/\n", "Q: Certain SSL Websites not loading in Chrome, Safari, Curl I'm trying to open bisonbrew.com but am getting ERR_CONNECTION_RESET with Chrome, and with Safari:\n\n'Safari can't open the page \"https://bisonbrew.com\" because Safari can't establish a  secure connection to the server \"bisonbrew.com\".\n\nI tried the steps from this answer but they don't work for OSX 11.6\nI tried to at least grab the certificate using openssl and this is the output\n\n$: openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 'bisonbrew.com':443\nCONNECTED(00000005)\n4673355436:error:14004410:SSL routines:CONNECT_CR_SRVR_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure:/System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/38cf1d983f/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/libressl/libressl-56.60.2/libressl-2.8/ssl/ssl_pkt.c:1200:SSL alert number 40\n4673355436:error:140040E5:SSL routines:CONNECT_CR_SRVR_HELLO:ssl handshake failure:/System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/38cf1d983f/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/libressl/libressl-56.60.2/libressl-2.8/ssl/ssl_pkt.c:585:\n---\nno peer certificate available\n---\nNo client certificate CA names sent\n---\nSSL handshake has read 7 bytes and written 0 bytes\n---\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\nSecure Renegotiation IS NOT supported\nCompression: NONE\nExpansion: NONE\nNo ALPN negotiated\nSSL-Session:\n    Protocol  : TLSv1.2\n    Cipher    : 0000\n    Session-ID: \n    Session-ID-ctx: \n    Master-Key: \n    Start Time: 1635268364\n    Timeout   : 7200 (sec)\n    Verify return code: 0 (ok)\n---\n\nUsing a different machine this is what I get, which looks correct:\n$: openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 'bisonbrew.com':443\nCONNECTED(00000003)\ndepth=2 C = IE, O = Baltimore, OU = CyberTrust, CN = Baltimore CyberTrust Root\nverify return:1\ndepth=1 C = US, O = \"Cloudflare, Inc.\", CN = Cloudflare Inc ECC CA-3\nverify return:1\ndepth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = San Francisco, O = \"Cloudflare, Inc.\", CN = sni.cloudflaressl.com\nverify return:1\n---\nCertificate chain\n 0 s:C = US, ST = California, L = San Francisco, O = \"Cloudflare, Inc.\", CN = sni.cloudflaressl.com\n   i:C = US, O = \"Cloudflare, Inc.\", CN = Cloudflare Inc ECC CA-3\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n\nThere are a couple of other sites that aren't working as well (such as www.brewersfriend.com), which led me to suspect it was an issue with my own machine.

It seems you can do it manually in a few different ways, but I'm not seeing a way to automate it.\nIt doesn't seem to hook up to the old Automator app, which I believe is probably going to go away at some point anyway. It doesn't seem to be available as an alert action in the calendar.\nSpecifically I'm looking at the shortcut to send a daily agenda email - this is pretty much a perfect case for scheduling something, since iCloud Calendar doesn't have it as an option - but it's pretty useless if I have to remember to click a button every morning.\n\nA: Based on @Gintaras's answer, since you can run a shortcut from a shell script, I was able to get it done - but not with launchd.\nInstead, I created a new application in the Automator app, to run a shell script, with the contents:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd /Users/MY_USER_NAME\nshortcuts run \"Email Schedule to Yourself\"\n\nThen I added a recurring calendar entry at 6am, with a custom alert to open a file, and selected this app. When the time hit, the email was sent successfully.\nI've read rumors that Automator is on the way out someday, so this may not be a permanent solution, but I'm sure it'll get us through the next several years.\nAnd FYI: I tried skipping the Automator step and running that script directly from Calendar, but apparently Calendar doesn't like running shell scripts.\n\nA: Related question on Stack Overflow:\nScheduling a terminal command or script file to run daily at a specific time Mac OS X\nPeople are using launchd to achieve this.

(Thank you!)\nThis specific comment really helped me.\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12557#issuecomment-954704523\nHere are the steps I took to fix:\n\n*\n\n*Add the following to Vagrantfile in the config.vm.provider section\nv.gui = true\n\n\n\n*Create a file as sudo: /etc/vbox/networks.conf\n\n\n*Paste the following in the networks.conf: * 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0\n\n\n*Then run this:\nsudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv && sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt && sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp  && sudo kextload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB\n\nThen vagrant up!\n\nA: This is a known issue and seems to be related to VirtualBox version 6.1.28.\nThe issue has been solved with the release of VirtualBox version 6.1.30.\nThere is a healthy and detailed thread in the official HashiCorp repo for Vagrant about this: “Vagrant up issues in Mac OS Monterey #12557”\nThe issue seems 100% unrelated to VirtualBox 6.1.28 or even the earlier 6.1.26 since people report the same overall behavior.\nNote the specific error you have posted:\nThere was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant\nfor controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.\n\nCommand: [\"startvm\", \"047f549a-e0be-48d9-93d5-6b1958594689\", \"--type\", \"headless\"]\n\nThe command that is failing is the default headless option for staring VMs via Vagrant. And the only work-around for now is to set the startup option to gui instead of headless.\nAs explained in the official Vagrant docs:\n\nGUI vs. Headless\nBy default, VirtualBox machines are started in headless mode, meaning there is no UI for the machines visible on the host machine. Sometimes, you want to have a UI. Common use cases include wanting to see a browser that may be running in the machine, or debugging a strange boot issue. You can easily tell the VirtualBox provider to boot with a GUI:\nconfig.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |v|\n  v.gui = true\nend\n\n\nSo just find the config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do block in your Vagrantfile and set that v.gui = true and it should work now; albeit with a GUI popping up which might be a wee bit annoying.\nThat said, another user in that issue thread states that config.vm.network networking commands might not work.\nSo this all might boil down to this being fixed in Vagrant 2.2.19? Or maybe VirtualBox is misbehaving as well?\nConfusing and annoying, but hopefully this helps in some way.\n\nUPDATE: It seems to be an issue in VirtualBox itself, and not Vagrant. The issue seems to be addressed in ticket number 20636 titled, “VBoxHeadless does not run in macOS Monterey 12.0.1 => fixed in SVN/next maintenance.” And according to a comment by the user “klaus”:\n\nThe latest 6.1 test build has the fix, but the usual \"not notarized\" caveat applies which is documented there, with the \"disable SIP\" workaround.\n\n\nUPDATE: Fixed in VirtualBox version 6.1.30; the version 6.1 changelog explicitly references ticket number 20636:\n\nVBoxHeadless: Fixed crash when running on macOS Monterey (bug #20636)\n\n\nA: This is a know issue with VirtualBox. They are currently working on it. It is not a Vagrant issue.\nYou can test this by going to VirtualBox and running the machine which works fine unless you try headless or detached state.\n\nA: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20637\nChanged 11 hours ago by klaus\nThe latest 6.1 test build has the fix, but the usual \"not notarized\" caveat applies which is documented there, with the \"disable SIP\" workaround.\nOh, and before I forget: the \"issue\" with vboxnet not getting addresses and so on is unrelated to this ticket.

It seems ilmbase was previously installed because ImageMagick (among other libraries) relied on it. The ilmbase formula reveals that the ilmbase library has since been renamed/replaced by the OpenEXR library.\nIf you are getting errors when trying to remove ilmbase or are seeing packages that still rely on it, consider running brew update and then brew upgrade to resolve any potential outdated dependency references.

The new machine came with iMovie, GarageBand, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, etc.\nWill restore a Mac to its factory settings also include those aforementioned applications?\n\nA: Yes. iMovie, GarageBand, Keynote, Pages, Numbers are free on recent Mac Os X versions , from Mojave I think : https://www.apple.com/om/creativity-apps/mac/\n", "Q: When is macOS Big Sur EOL, meaning there will be no more security fixes? I have a relatively new MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), which works wonderfully and is in daily use.\nI was shocked to discover that macOS Monterey is not supported on my relatively new machine (macOS Monterey is compatible with these computers). Are there any technical reasons for this? Or is the only reason to force the sale of new devices?\nWhen is macOS Big Sur EOL, meaning there will be no more security fixes? I did not find a lifecycle document with specific dates at Apple KB.\n\nA: The \"rule of thumb\" is 10 years - 5 years full support followed by 5 years partial support.\nApple publishes a list which covers hardware repair. Software support generally but not absolutely follows this list.\nGetting a service for your Apple product after its warranty has expired\nIn general, if it's on the Vintage list it will still get security updates even after it no longer gets full OS upgrades. Once on the Obsolete list, support is EoL.\nHistorically, Apple have issued regular security updates for OSes up to \"three prior\". Currently, Mojave still gets security updates, earlier OSes don't. [That is likely to change as of now, as Mojave becomes \"four prior\".]\n\nA: Apple does not provide that kind of information. However, the materials needed to make a guess can be found on this site (source, it's MIT licensed). From the information as far as I can tell on this site, it seems that support will be provided for basically three years from the release of it's version.\nThis is just my opinion, but I wouldn't call a 7-year-old PC a \"relatively new\". It's old.\n\nA: There do not appear to be technical reasons for not allowing you to install macOS Monterey on your MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), as you can install macOS Monterey on your device in an unofficial way. Performance may not be great, but (in my opinion) that should not block you from installing it (though a warning message would be understandable). There were some devices that Apple dropped that did have issues with the new update, but the OpenCore Legacy Patcher developers were able to fix them, but your device was never one of the models affected from what I can tell.\nNobody knows for sure when macOS Big Sur will stop getting security updates, but as Skye-AT and Tetsujin mentioned, Apple usually provides security updates for OSes up to 3 versions prior, so you probably still have at least 3 years of support.\nWhen that ends, if you wish to install macOS Monterey, OpenCore Legacy Patcher supports your MacBook Air and macOS Monterey, so you can follow their instructions. Warning: I have not attempted these steps (fortunately my Mac is from 2015), so do so at your own risk (and feel free to use any up-to-date guide at that time.) The final version of macOS Monterey released just a couple days ago, so there still may be some undiscovered bugs running it on unofficial hardware, but it appears so far there are no bugs on your model.\n", "Q: use an iCloud+ «hide my email» apple ID forward address as an alias to send mail Hide my email is the neat feature introduced by apple earlier, and since then I have been trying to figure out how I can use those forward addresses as sender address when composing emails on the iPhone.\nThe adressess don’t appear when tapping on current sender address when composing an email in apple mail.\nI figured I should try to add one of the «hide my email» forward addresses manually in appleid.apple.com as an alias, but the process of adding an alias stop at waiting for a verification code from the appleid service.\nThe use of «hide my email» if I can’t send or reply an email is limited to signing up for newsletters.\nAny insight on this?\nedit: also in the browser icloud.com/Mail behind the gear icon you can add up to 3 aliases, but the rule «Alias names may only contain unaccented letters, numbers, periods, and underscores.» disqualify the generated «hide my email» addresses as they typically contain a - sign\n2nd edit: I did some further digging and found a related feature in a recent team up between 1password and fastmail called \"masked email\" and integration. Fastmail supposedly provide the ability to send from the randomly generated addresses.\n3rd edit: an extra feature with icloud+ is custom domain as icloud email. you will need to update DNS records at your domain registrar/host with TXT, SPF, MX servers, and DKIM to point to icloud. This feature do allow for use of more addresses pointing to the same mailbox, and new addresses are fairly simple to create and delete, but they will not be random like those \"hide my email\" generate as you will have to manage them yourself, and they all point to your own custom domain anyway\n4th edit: don’t know why I didn’t notice this feature before, but apparently «Hide my email» feature seamless reply to email, only not a send from option when composing email.\nalso the custom domain feature with icloud+ appear to have an issue with DKIM signing email sent from an iphone mail app. For some reason sending from the browser version of icloud mail sign sent mail with DKIM.\n\nA: This doesn’t appear to be the design intent of the service. Apple is setting up inbound only aliases so that multiple mailboxes funnel mails to one account, not setting up multiple accounts or aliases to send out mail.\nApple iCloud isn’t currently the service for masking outgoing mails or handling multiple accounts, so you can’t configure your way around this limitation by client side configuration changes.\nCheck out https://www.fastmail.com/ -  I’ve used them in tandem with Apple mail for almost a decade and couldn’t be happier with the value both provide me. Each vendor does things I like, with Fastmail being more customizable and having some extra features Apple doesn’t offer.\n\nA: A little late to the party and I’m not trying to supply an answer but it seems this is my only option…\nBmike above commented (I just joined to comment but apparently need points to comment which is pretty much a useless loop…) that:\nThe short answer is no, Apple didn’t design this to let you send mail from a private address.\nOh but it does! When I’m composing an email from my iPhone, using the default Mail app, I CAN select the From: field and choose “Hide my email” at which point Apple will create a NEW masked/alias address to send that particular email from! So indeed Apple IS providing this service (which will then come from an icloud address negating the other comment thread about spammers) only you can’t select an [Apple created] hidden email created previously to sign up with a service/site you intend to use going forward! In this case I’m attempting to email the site’s support but need it to come from the email address I registered with. Doesn’t make sense whatsoever. I realize this isn’t a coding question/comment but felt this needed to be raised in response to the assertions made above.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the MacBook screen start below the notch so the user doesn't lose valuable top bar width? Apple has decided to go with a notch instead of a wider top bezel for their latest MacBook generation. This notch takes the place of valuable screen real estate in the top bar regardless of how it's incorporated: either it covers up interactive menu items and widgets so you cannot see them but can still move your mouse beneath them, OR it takes up place that could have been used by interactive menu items and widgets.\nThere are users out there who would prefer to give up some of the vertical area of the screen so they can have that notch out of the way of more important menu bar space. Can users who want to make that trade somehow configure the boundaries of their MacBook screen to start below this notch?\n\nA: Source.\nThis can only be done on a per-application basis.  It's not possible to have the menu bar always below the notch, like using a global setting.\n\n*\n\n*Close the app you want below the notch.\n\n*Click on an app’s icon in the Finder and Get Info on it (Cmd + I on your keyboard, or go to File > Get Info).\n\n*If it’s available, you’ll find an option in the General section to “Scale to fit below built-in camera.” Check that box, close Get Info.\n\n*When you launch the app and go into full-screen mode, the menu bar will be positioned under the notch.\n\n*According to Apple’s Developer Documentation for User Interface, this setting shows up if a developer doesn’t write their software to switch on its own. If a developer decides to write their software to use the mode they deem best for their app, the option is not available.\n\n*In case you’re wondering, this option is not available for the macOS Monterey Finder, which is basically an app that runs in full-screen mode all the time. So you can’t block out the notch by default, at least for now.\n\n\nUpdate: Macrumors lists a few new applications that will make the menu bar adjustments for you:\n\n*\n\n*Forehead (free): Besides letting you switch between your default wallpaper and a black notchless one, Forehead includes options to round the corners of the screen, similar to the rounded top corners of the new MacBook Pros. The ability to simulate a notch on older Macs is coming in an update.\n\n\n*TopNotch (free): Offers the same features as Forehead, and also supports Dynamic Wallpapers, works with multiple displays and spaces, and remains in the background and detects for wallpaper changes.\n\n\n*De-Notch-ifier (paid): Offers the same features as TopNotch, just in the form of a dropdown menu in the menu bar. De-Notch-ifier isn't a completely new app, rather it's a pre-configured version of Boring Old Menu Bar that gives you a boring old non-transparent menu bar on macOS Big Sur and later. If you buy one app, you get the other for free.\n", "Q: What factors prevent an IDE for iPad from being made? It’s now common to use cloud-based IDEs like VS Code through a service like Gitpod. If the code repository is in the cloud and a service like Gitpod or Digital Ocean provides a remote machine, what are the reasons there’s no sophisticated front-end IDE like VS Code available in the App Store (which could connect via SSH like Termius)?\n\nA: There are no such \"platform restrictions\" that prevent an IDE as described to be made for the iPad.\nIn fact, you can use Visual Studio Code on your iPad today and have it access a code repository in the cloud, or a remote machine on for example Digital Ocean.\nFor example you can open up this link in your browser:\nhttps://github.dev/\nAnd you'll be able to access GitHub's VS Code.\nOr you could install Visual Studio Code Server on your Digital Ocean machine and use a service such as the following to have Visual Studio Code use it:\nhttps://vscode.dev\nHere's a nifty guide on how to setup it all up based on a Tailscale private network:\nhttps://tailscale.com/kb/1166/vscode-ipad/\n", "Q: How to sync Podcast playing across devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac)?

How can I set an application to Low Resolution mode?\n\nA: OK, I have found a temporary solution, which involves changing the info.plist file inside the application.\n\n*\n\n*Using XCode, open up:\n/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n\n*Change High Resolution Capable to NO\n\n\n*Save\nI found that I had to change the file permissions to allow the changes to be saved.\nI’m not very familiar with the PListBuddy shell program, but the following also seems to work:\nThis displays the current settings:\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \\\n    -c 'print NSHighResolutionCapable' \\\n    /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nThis changes the setting:\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy \\\n    -c 'set NSHighResolutionCapable false' \\\n    /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*The sudo is required to grant permissions to make changes.\n\n*The  \\ at the end of each line allows it to be continued on the next.\n\n*The -c ' … ' part is the actual command, which you could also use interactively.\n\nAs you see, the application is VirtualBoxVM.app, which is unusual in that it is an app within an app. The normal location for the Info.plist file is something like /Applications/something.app/Contents/Info.plist .\nI had to re-install Virtual Box, so I had to try this in earnest, and it worked for me.\nI’m still looking for a better solution, though.\n\nA: Thanks Manngo,\nYou can edit the Info.plist file directly and save it.\nMake sure VirtualBox isn't running, then\nsudo vim /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/Resources/VirtualBoxVM.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nchange\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>          <true/>\n\nto\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>          <false/>\n\nand save the file.\n", "Q: How can I make my Mac automatically switch to a new speaker when it is connected, and back to my internal speakers after it's disconnected? For some reason, when I connect my Sony Bluetooth speaker to my Mac, my Mac usually does not automatically set this Bluetooth speaker as my audio output device. Audio continues playing from my internal speakers until I manually click the audio icon in the menu bar and set \"SRS-XB12\" as my output device.\nFurthermore, when I disconnect this speaker, my Mac sets the audio output device to my USB Microphone, rather than back to my internal speakers.\nWhen I connect my Bluetooth speaker, I want my Mac to automatically start playing audio from that speaker. When I disconnect my speaker, I want it to play audio from the internal speakers. How can I make that happen?\n\nA: After spending far too many hours trying to find the root cause of why this was happening, I gave up and wrote a shell script.\nFirst, we need a way to find and change audio devices from the command line. Luckily, developer Deweller made a small utility to do exactly that: https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx. It can be installed via Homebrew or MacPorts if you have either installed; alternately, download the Intel or Apple Silicon binary from MacPorts directly, and copy switchaudiosource into /usr/local/bin; it should work as-is with no dependencies.\nI wrote the following script. You'll want to edit the names of speakerA and SpeakerB.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwhile sleep 2\ndo\n    speakerA=\"SRS-XB12\"\n    speakerB=\"Built-in Output\"\n\n    switchAndRewind() {\n        echo $1 > /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt\n        if [ \"$(switchaudiosource -c)\" != \"$2\" ]\n        then\n            for device in {output,system}\n            do\n                    SwitchAudioSource -t \"$device\" -s \"$2\"\n            done\n            osascript -e 'if application \"QuickTime Player\" is not running then return' -e 'tell application \"QuickTime Player\"' -e 'repeat with i from 1 to count of every document' -e 'if document i is playing and duration of document i > 0 then set current time of document i to (current time of document i) - 2' -e 'end repeat' -e 'end tell'\n        fi\n    }\n\n    if ! cat /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt\n    then\n        switchaudiosource -a | grep $speakerA && echo \"connected\" > /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt || echo \"disconnected\" > /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt\n    elif [ \"$(cat /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt)\" == \"disconnected\" ] && switchaudiosource -a | grep $speakerA\n    then\n        switchAndRewind \"connected\" \"$speakerA\"\n    elif [ \"$(cat /tmp/audioSwitcherSavedState.txt)\" == \"connected\" ] && ! switchaudiosource -a | grep $speakerA\n    then\n        switchAndRewind \"disconnected\" \"$speakerB\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nThis script does the following every 2 seconds:\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't already exist, create a temporary text file which records whether speakerA is connected to the Mac.\n\n*If speakerA was previously disconnected, and is now connected, switch to speakerA.\n\n*If speakerA was previously connected, and is now disconnected, switch to SpeakerB (my internal speakers).\n\n*In either of the above two cases, we also update the temporary file, so the code will only run once per connection or disconnection. And, if Quicktime is currently playing any audio, we'll rewind the file a few seconds so I don't miss anything as devices are switching.\n\nIn order for this script to be useful, I needed it to start automatically, so I made a LaunchAgent. I decided I wanted this to live as a single, self-contained file, so I put all the code on one (unreadable) line and dumped it directly into my LaunchAgent plist. Note that because LaunchAgents need to know the full path to most binaries, this LaunchAgent assumes that the switchaudiosource binary lives in /usr/local/bin/.\n<!--\n\nChanges audio output device to \"SRS-XB12\" when a device by that name is connected; changes audio output device back to \"Built-in Output\" when a device named \"SRS-XB12\" is disconnected.

EDIT in 2023: I have macOS 13.2 Ventura and vscode 1.74.3 installed now, and this problem isn't reproducing the same way anymore. It looks like this is due to a relatively new vscode feature, Terminal Environment inheritance which is running the login shell:\n\nWhen VS Code is opened, it launches a login shell environment in order to source a shell environment. This is done because developer tools are often added to the $PATH in a shell launch script like ~/.bash_profile.\n\nThis doesn't change the question, about a general fix without every app needing to add this custom workaround.\n\nI have the option \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" set, which on my 11.6 macbook will reopen apps like vscode and iTerm2 after I restart. I want the reopened windows to have the expected environment variables set.\nMost apps will reopen with no problem, but in vscode I'll get the error The terminal process failed to launch: Path to shell executable \"pwsh\" does not exist. As far as I can tell, the problem is related to the system procedure for creating PATH not running for windows reopened at login. By launching bash I can see the process PATH environment variable is something like /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin which explains the \"pwsh\" does not exist error... (because pwsh is in /usr/local/bin/ which normally is in my PATH but is missing here.)\nI could solve the immediate problem by specifying the full path to my shell executable in my vscode config, but other tools in /etc/paths wouldn't be included in PATH automatically either.\nIs there some macOS setting I can change so that reopened windows have the right environment variables?\nOr, I see that when iTerm2 reopens it starts my pwsh shell and somehow has the correct PATH -- could the vscode app copy the startup logic from iTerm2 to start with the right environment variables?\n\nA: I don't think you can solve the root problem. Every app/command can set/reset its own Environment variables. The problem is really complicated, if there's a way to set a path globally so that it works in every case i would like to know it too. Thing is when you're launching a deamon - you have to set paths in plist file, because it gets a reset. When you run 'sudo su' - a reset and you have to edit /etc/sudoers. When you run a shell - a reset.\nThe app decides what environment variables it likes to have, so you usually mess up with specific app's config or the launch config. If the problem is with vscode and you can fix it by editing vscode's config - do it.\nThe most generic place where variables are stored is '/private/etc/paths', but something like /usr/local/bin should already be there.\n", "Q: Wifi Drops when in Clamshell Mode I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020) in clamshell mode, connected to a 4k monitor and power through a USB-C hub.

I just installed macOS Monterey on my 2018 Mac mini and noticed after toying around with the settings that something called \"Kerberos\" is coming up as one of the items allowed to send notifications in the notification settings. What is this, why is it here after not having been previously, is it malware, and if so, how do I get rid of it? Never seen this before so not sure why it's here now.\n\nA: Kerberos is a Single-Sign On (SSO) extension. Apple uses it to allow users to replace many different passwords by a single one.\nHere are the full details, from the horse's mouth : apple doc\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade Mac OSX because my hard drive is encrypted I wanted to upgrade from Big Sur to Monterey and after the download completed, I get this message, that I cannot upgrade because my disk was encrypted.\n\n\nA: I got it working in the end!

Is there an open source alternative to diskutil available for macOS? I am hoping to find a command line program that perform the same core functions like:\n\n*\n\n*verify disk or volume\n\n\n*repair disk or volume\n\n\n*mount disk or volume\n\n\n*partitioning disk etc.\n\n\n*obtain info on a disk\n\n\n*obtain activity on a disk\nAnd maybe can perform more functions than the above. And which can be compiled to run on macOS.\nReason for this: I am trying to learn the internals of such disk functions. diskutil is not open source unfortunately. I just need something similar, I do not need support for HFS or APFS if this is a problem. Also, I  have tried tracing back to the BSD's diskutil version on which macOS diskutil is based, but I cannot seem to find a way to simply obtain the binary for diskutil and the source code, it seems to be lumped together with the entire kernel's code on (https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/).\nI do not have enough experience/knowledge to navigate the source tree.\nAny suggestion will be really appreciated.\n\nA: Not sure what's out there for macOS, but here is the source code for gparted: https://github.com/GNOME/gparted. It's written in C++.\n\nA: No - not on macOS or Apple provided systems. If you want to start with diskutil nonetheless, there are tools to help guide you on this path, I would start with Hopper - a disassembler. You don’t need the source to see what Apple has shipped\n\n*\n\n*https://www.hopperapp.com/\nYour learning might be faster though if you do not need Apple specific things like HFS or APFS by studying an OS to which all the source is open.\n", "Q: How do you manage your zsh aliases? I guess I should just put all my alises in the ~/.zshrc, correct? Or are there other places that's a better fit for personal alises?\nAlso wondering how you manage your list of aliases as you move between machines?\n\nA: Here's what I choose as a solution. I found this helps keep my initial .zshrc file free of clutter.\nPlace the aliases in their own file, ie: .zsh_aliases. You can also create a file for other things, like app shortcuts.\nFrom there, just add a line in your .zshrc like the following;\nsource ~/.zsh_aliases\n\nFeel free to reference any file that you might create. They will be included in each session.

Each rule has a configuration like the following:\n\nAgain, a bit clunky but it works.\n", "Q: USB webcam no output I got a pretty weird problem with my m1 Macbook air (Monterey). The USB webcam sometimes outputs a black screen on all applications.\n\n*\n\n*The webcam doesn't have any cover.\n\n*The webcam is plugged in a usb 3.0 hub, which is plugged in a usb-c dongle, which is connected to my macbook. Pulling out and re-plug in the dongle, the hub, as well as the camera won't solve the problem.\n\n*Turning the macbook off and back on is a hit or miss: sometimes it can fix it, other times it can't.\n\n*Entering safe mode can fix the problem. Rebooting into the normal mode after entering safe mode will keep the problem solved. But it will come back randomly.\n\n*The camera works perfectly fine on another windows laptop.\n\n*Ok, I just found this out: it seems like plugging in the webcam while the internal camera is in use can cause this problem. The internal camera always works fine.\n\n*Never had this problem on Big Sur. It's probably a Monterey bug.\n\nEdit:\n\n*\n\n*Seems like the it's the Plug-n-Play part of the function is broken. The camera has to be connected from boot, and will fail after it's unplugged and plugged back in when Mac is turned on.\n\nWhat's my next step? Anyone having a similar problem?\n\nA: If you have a direct USB-C to USB-A, try using that.\n\nA: I'm on M1 laptop, and the Logitech B525 completely stopped working after the Monterey upgrade.\nMysteriously, I found that installing ManyCam fixed all my webcam problems (apps needed be restarted to see the camera). I can now unplug and plug it again, and all the apps sees it. Uninstalling ManyCam reintroduces the problem. I never had ManyCam installed before having that problem, so it wasn't causing the problem to begin with.\nWhile using the camera, I can see a process called ManyCamVideoDeviceAgent (intel) that disappears when stop using the camera. I guess it is doing something right.\n", "Q: iOS update via iTunes to latest MINOR version? I have iOS 14.7.1 and can't update to 14.8.1 directly in iPhone.\niTunes wants to update only to iOS 15.1:\n\nHow to update to 14.8.1 via iTunes?\n\n\nA: Normally, if you have difficulties updating OTA, then you can manually fetch the updater, an .ipsw file, & run it manually from iTunes [Finder in newer macOS.]\nIf you are trying to update to the latest iOS, then iTunes will usually find the correct file for you. If, as in this case, there is a security update for an earlier iOS then you may have to fetch it manually.\nipsw.me contains lists of .ipsw files for all devices, going back into the mists of time. They do not store the content, merely the correct addresses to where Apple keeps these updates.\nThey are only useful for as long as Apple are still signing the update - usually a couple of weeks after the next update is released; the window of opportunity can be short.\nIf you download one of these, then in iTunes you  Opt ⌥  click the Update button & you will be asked to choose a file to update from, rather than the automatic process. Once chosen, assuming it's the correct file & still being signed, then the update will proceed in the same way as any regular update.\n", "Q: Mac stuck booting after Monterey I have a 2017 27in retina iMac booting off of a (stable) DIY m.2 usb drive (controller: Realtek RTL9210 NVME). I upgraded to Monterey (public release - NOT beta) on Oct 25, the day it was released. It seems to have installed macOS 12.0.1. It upgraded and booted fine, and I interacted and configured the system (I changed app settings that were new with Monterey). When I shut it down (night) and booted it up (morning), the boot progress bar wouldn't cross 1/2 (everything else was normal). I tried booting in safe mode, but got no luck. I reinstalled Monterey with recovery mode (DID NOT WIPE DISK). However, I had the same issue. I tried safe mode again, no luck. I reset NVRAM and tried again, safe and non-safe (no luck). I booted into verbose mode to get the output, and it didn't seem like something I could fix. Here is the output:\nFinally, I tried booting on a 2015 iMac 5K. No luck there either.\nI needed my Mac, so I reinstalled Big Sur (fresh) from an external boot drive and used a TM backup to restore my data. Unfortunately, this means I cannot perform any more tests.\nMy main questions are, what went wrong (curious), and if/when I can install Monterey again (I would highly prefer upgrading, even if I have to wait a month or 2). I would prefer not to, but am fine if I need to re-install Big Sur, but I would not like to right now, so I will most likely execute suggestions in a month if there is not a high level of certainty.\nP.S: the only kernel extension I have that I know of is VirtualBox\nThanks again to all who answer my question.\nEdit: see the solution I posted\n\nA: Are you using external hard drive?\nSome people reported extremely long boot times (30+ minutes). Try to leave your mac booting for an hour, maybe it will boot up.\nIf that's the case, as for temporary solution: let your mac sleep, instead of shutting down, till fix comes out.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/253302798\nIt seems there’s a problem with USB devices:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/253303875\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/253308334\nTry to remove all external peripherals while booting up, including mouse and keyboard.\nAnother similar issue:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/qgcw3z/long_boot_after_monterey_update/\nMaybe try to disable bluetooth\nI have 2017 iMac 27 retina myself, it boots in 20 seconds, internal SSD.\n\nA: To help anyone with a similar issue, I got a jm583 enclosure from Amazon, swapped my Big Sur ssd into there, booted and upgraded to Monterey, and then the Mac booted in 2 minutes (versus 30). However, this still was not normal speed (45 sec), so I did a clean install and restored from a TM backup. After doing this, the boot time was reduced to 45 seconds in the JM583 enclosure. When I tested switching back to the (better) Realtek enclosure,the boot time increased back to 20 minutes, so I had to (and you will have to) permanently switch to your new enclosure.\n*edit: my boot time went back to 2 mins after restoring. I guess ive just put so much on my mac that it boots slower now.\n", "Q: iPhone 13 mini missing mail I got a new iPhone 13 mini a few days ago, and transferred data from my iPhone 5S.\nThis seemed to be OK (and more straightforward than I remember) BUT I just discovered my email accounts were not transferred (apart from iCloud, which I don't use and one other not used for years).\nIs this normal?\nCan I transfer?\nI could download setup from my ISP, as I note the profiles on my old phone were missing from the iPhone 13 mini.\n\nA: I \"resolved\" the problem by downloading .mobileconfig files from my hosting site and installing.\nI needed to enter gmail address & password to get gmail app working.\nStill unclear WHY they didn't transfer.\n", "Q: Preview doesn't open pdf tabs in same window after updating to Monterey I updated from Big Sur to Monterey yesterday on my M1 Air but seem to have lost the option to open multiple pdfs in same window using Preview.\nHere are the settings:\n\n\n\nA: From the official user guide at https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/prvw1085/mac\n\nNote: To open multiple PDFs in the same window, go to System Preferences > General , then choose Always from the “Prefer tabs when opening documents” pop-up menu.

I use the MacBook as the \"Main Display\" and therefore the dock shows up on the MacBook screen.\nIf I use the shortcut CMD+f1, (the shortcut switches between Mirroring and Extending the display), it makes my external display the Main Display and starts mirroring my external display on to the MacBook.\" My external display is an ultra wide so it makes the MacBook display weird, since it \"optimizes\" for the Main Display.\nI'm not sure why it changes the Main Display? Is there a way to prevent that or a shortcut to switch the Main Display?\nIf I use the shortcut again, it goes back to normal with the MacBook screen being the Main Display.\nAny app that can make switching also would help!\n\nA: I had this same issue, and finally solved it by using https://github.com/fcanas/mirror-displays\nI just did the brew install brew install fcanas/tap/mirror-displays and then running mirror makes my macbook monitor the primary monitor, and then mirror again to toggle it back\n", "Q: Highlight Menu Bar Clock in macOS Big Sur After upgrading my Mac to Big Sur (11.6), I noticed that my Menu Bar clock has a very faint color and makes it hard to read the time.\n\nIs there a way to change this to bring older behavior?

I searched the web, but I can only find information that explains what the modal dialog is. I would like to know why it's called that. The modality defined in that way.\n\nIn linguistics and philosophy, modality is the phenomenon whereby language is used to discuss possible situations. For instance, a modal expression may convey that something is likely, desirable, or permissible. Quintessential modal expressions include modal auxiliaries such as \"could\", \"should\", or \"must\"; modal adverbs such as \"possibly\" or \"necessarily\"; and modal adjectives such as \"conceivable\" or \"probable\". However, modal components have been identified in the meanings of countless natural language expressions including counterfactuals, propositional attitudes, evidentials, habituals, and generics.\n\nIs its meaning is derived from must or similar? Or does it have another origin?\n\nA: You're starting from the wrong definition of mode\nEtymologically, from the latin modus [as in the commonly-used modus operandi - method of operation, or working method.]\nEtymological definition from Oxford Dictionary via Google\n\nlate Middle English (in the musical and grammatical senses): from Latin modus ‘measure’, from an Indo-European root shared by mete; compare with mood.\n\nFrom the Cambridge Dictionary\n\nmode (noun) WAY\na way of operating, living, or behaving:\n\n*\n\n*Each department in the company has its own mode of operation.\n\n*Railways are an important mode of transport for the economy.\n\n*Switch your phone to silent mode.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia - Mode (user interface)\n\nIn user interface design, a mode is a distinct setting within a computer program or any physical machine interface, in which the same user input will produce perceived results different from those that it would in other settings.\n\nThen from Wikipedia - Modal Window\n\nIn user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window.\nA modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main window. Modal windows are sometimes called heavy windows or modal dialogs because they often display a dialog box.\n\nSo, in effect, a modal dialog changes the method/mode of operation/interaction with the application, as it must be completed/dismissed before you can return to the normal mode of operation. You cannot get 'behind' a modal dialog to interact with the application as normal.\n", "Q: \"Quick note\" hot corner not working I have a hot corner turned on for quick note in lower right but nothing happens when I try it. Just installed Monterey yesterday. Is there something I might be missing?\n\nA: I think I found a bug. So when an app on my second display has focus, the quick note does not work. If I give an app in display 1 has focus, quick note works.\nEven weirder is that it does work the first time after giving an app on display 1 focus, but it starts working on the second try.\n\nA: I had same issue with second monitor. I went to hot corner settings in preferences. The right bottom corner was showing \"quick notes\". I changed it to some other option and then changed it back. Now it's working. Hope it helps you.\n\nA: I just upgraded to Monterey and had this issue.  When I viewed System Preferences for Hot Corners, I see that the default hot corner to use Quick Notes requires that you hold down the Command key ⌘ before putting the cursor in the bottom right.  That worked for me.  I can also see why changing it to something and then changing it back to Quick Notes (without holding the Command Key ⌘ down would also work for people. :)\n\nA: I had this problem, and it turned out to be a result of \"On My Mac\" notes being disabled. To fix it, I opened the Notes app, went to preferences, and clicked \"Enable the On My Mac account\". After this, the hot corner and shortcut keys worked to create quick notes.\n\nA: I've just fixed it for myself so I made an account to share. You have to offset your displays in the display settings. For me, I have 3 monitors and I use the centre one as my main. In the settings, I raised monitors 1 and 3 slightly so monitor two has its own corners and voila, it works.\n\nA: In macOS Monterey there is a default Hot Corner setup in System Preferences > Mission Control > Hot Corners… in the lower right Active Screen Corners for Quick Note.\nWhen one brings the mouse cursor to the lower right cornet of the screen a small round-nosed square rises out of the corner, as show in the images below.\nOne must click on the small round-nosed square that rises out of the corner for the New Note to open.\n\nNote that with the default wallpaper the small round-nosed square that rises out of the corner is almost not noticeable as it's dark in color.\nIn testing, a quick drag of the mouse to the lower right corner of the screen and clicking when the mouse got there opens Notes to a New Note.\nIf you do not see this small round-nosed square that rises out of the corner then I'd toggle the bit, so to speak, by turning off the Hot Corner and turning it back on by setting it to something else, e.g. - and then back to Quick Note.\n\nHere is a screen shot with the light colored background for the wallpaper and the small round-nosed square that rises out of the corner is quite clear.\n\n", "Q: Identifying macOS versions in backups If I go to ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync in my boot system or in a Time Machine backup, I can look in Backup/*/Manifest.plist to find what versions of iOS were backed up.\nIs there a human-readable way to know what version of macOS was in a particular Time Machine backup (other than restoring it to use \"About this Mac\")?\nA related question is Determining OS X version from Time Machine backup but it is six years old, and if the answer was valid then, it is not valid for any of my backups which go back to December 2020.\nI have found SystemVersion.plist files in some of the backups, but all of them, from December 2020 till today say \"10.15.7\" and many of the backups have nothing but CoreServices.bundle in that director.  Yesterday, I had 11.something and now I have 12.0.1 which is what is stated in the file in my running system.  So the file in the latest backup is DIFFERENT than the file that Time Machine should have put there!\nUpdate: find has been crawling the backups for more than 24 hours and has found some SystemVersion.plist files, but the few I've looked at so far have seemingly contradictory contents.  And some of them cite versions that I know have never been on this machine—bought it with Catalina and immediately put Big Sur on it before any backups.\n\nA: Each interval when TimeMachine backs up files writes a SystemVersion.plist file to document the version running the backup.\n\n*\n\n*Determining OS X version from Time Machine backup\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\nThe above file is what shows you the current version, so you would browse the destination of choice to validate what version was running in the past if you are not interested in the Latest instance that the linked question provides.\nFor searching TimeMachine data, there is no better tool than BackupLoupe. I would use that to locate the files in question if you can’t use mdfind or just enumerate them by date for occasional lookup.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\nOne tip for backuploupe is if you have a non-empty drive, have it index only a few snaps first and see if it suits your needs before letting it digest a drive overnight.\n", "Q: Open an Encrypted Folder In Another Mac I encrypted a folder in a MacBook Pro running Big Sur following this article: https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/encrypt-mac-folder/\nAm I able to copy this .dmg file to another Mac and open it with the password? Or is this encrypted file now bound to the machine in which it was created? What if the other mac has a different OS (other than Big Sur)?\nI apologize if the answer is obvious, I am in the process of getting another Mac and have not been able to test yet. I was also not able to find the answer online.\n\nA: No, an encrypted DMG is not permanently linked to the computer that created it. So you can easily copy it to another Mac and open it there (Finder will prompt you for the password).\nBTW... you are not \"encrypting a folder\", the original folder remains and is still accessible.\n", "Q: Can 2021 MacBook Pro be permanently set to have display brightness of 1000 nits? It was promising to hear that the new MacBook Pros have a display brightness of 1000 nits (peak brightness of 1600 nits):\n\nHowever, a more recent review of the laptops said:\n\nbut it's not quite what you think, the display mostly runs at a max of 500 nits ... allows it to hit that 1600 nits brightness, but only when you're viewing HDR content, the rest of the system is the same as ever 500 nits\n\nQuestion\nCan the new MacBook Pros be somehow forced to stay at 1000 nits all the time? That is, is there a way to force a higher-than-500-nits brightness on all content (not just HDR content)?\n\nA: Hit 1,600 nits of brightness on your M1 Macbook Pro using the MacOS app Lunar.fyi\nHere's the changelog for the version that introduced the feature: Lunar v5.5.1\nProbably shouldn't use this for too long - best if you're in bright sunlight and need it for a short amount of time, but it's awesome!\nThere's also an FAQ clarifying the safety of using this feature: Is XDR Brightness safe?\n\nA: No, as display systems are designed to prevent potentially damaging screen states from occurring which is what a permanent 1000 nit setting would do the screen. This could be embedded within unalterable firmware or somewhere deep in the OS, or somewhere else, but in any case belongs to the category of things that are not user changeable.\nThe same behaviour occurs with the latest 12.9 iPad Pro.\nTheoretically it can be overriden if you can modify the firmware, or the display controller, directly but that’s probably not what you meant as that would require tearing down your laptop and reverse engineering.\nFor reference, displays that are designed to sustain 1000 nits, or higher, are typically thicker and have active cooling systems such as outdoor displays, commercial video walls, or Apple’s own XDR display.\n", "Q: zsh: permission denied when Terminal has Full Disk Access I regularly use shell files to execute tasks on my Mac quicker.\nI just upgraded to MacOS Monterey today, and since then, any shell files I have created, will not execute.

If I install an app from the App Store and then uninstall it, will it leave any changes other than the system log?\n\nA: Most apps will leave behind things such as receipts, preference files, scripts etc.\nThese are generally harmless but take up small amounts of disk space.\nUsing something like AppCleaner(freeware) will let you see what bits may be left over & allow you to selectively delete them too.\nRandom example…\n\n", "Q: HAMA USB Hub Failing Under macOS Monterey & Apple Silicon M1 Edit: macOS Monterey have issues with USB Hubs. You can watch topic from here: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/683409\nI’m using macOS Monterey 12.0.1 with Apple Silicon M1 iMac 24\".\nI bought Hama USB-C Hub, Multiport, 5 Ports, 2 x USB-A, USB-C, HDMI™, LAN/Ethernet (GTIN: 4047443436818) from Turkey at last month. As I read on both technical specifications and user manual, the USB-C port on device is bi- directional;  it both supports PD and data transfer.\n\nI tested this functionality both Windows 10 & 11 and macOS with M1 (Apple Silicon) chip. On Windows , the port works bi-directional perfectly. However, Apple Silicon device not support data transfer from port, supports only power delivery. If I connect a USB-C device from mac port directly, it runs perfectly.\nHow can I tell if the fault is with my Apple silicon Mac or or caused a broken hub ?\n\nA: I realized  that I attached the hub to USB & ThunderBolt 4 port. Due to my M1 iMac cannot charged with PD, USB controller closes this port I think. After connecting the hub to USB-C 3.2 port, USB-C port on the hub was started working. This is not an issue, it causes from misunderstanding how the iMac ports behave. After few days, USB-C port on Hub disabled again. Changing the port of Hub a few days apart is the the only solution right now.\n\nA: I use several USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 hubs and they work for data transfer like you report with windows. The hubs work on macOS and windows and it doesn’t matter M1 or Intel cpu for our hubs. I don’t have a Hama to test, though.\nI’m using Anker and CalDigit hubs mostly for work.\nNot all USB cables and ports are certified, so I would start with trying a different hub or cable if you have them. If not, you will need some extra skills to read the system logs and/or reach out to vendor support.\n\n*\n\n*Apple will likely ask you to update your Apple software and check with the vendor.\n\n*The vendor will likely ask you to check with Apple.\n\nKeeping good notes on the OS version and open system profiler to get details on the USB device will help if you end up crowd sourcing if your specific vendor, device firmware work with specific macOS version.\n", "Q: How do I check the access rights of an app?

I have setup a Raspberry Pi to be my Time Machine remote device. It seems to work properly since I have been able to do some backups.\nIn the meantime I have changed the Raspberry Pi hostname and so Time Machine is not able to find anymore the device in the network (since it is still looking for the old hostname).\nIn order to fix this issue I have tried to change the Time Machine setting file (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist), by replacing the old hostname with the new one in its raw content. However, after a reboot, the file in question is replaced with a new blank file and Time Machine results to be not configured.\nIs it possible to tell Time Machine to find for another device in local network? If yes, how?\n\nA: The issue can be resolved by removing the old device from Time Machine settings and adding the new one.\nAfter connecting to the new device (in this case, the same Raspberry Pi but with a different hostname), if Time Machine detects the presence of some previous backups, user will be prompted to start new backups from scratch or to continue from the already made ones.\nWithout removing the old device, Time Machine will actually only ask whether alternate the devices in the backup execution.\n", "Q: Impossible to pair Apple Wireless Keyboard M9270LL/A after update to Monterey 12.0.1 EDIT: after an ultimate SMC/PRAM reset, @doublepluskat's solution below finally worked. Currently typing on my A1016 keyboard. Many thanks!\nI have trouble pairing again my white Apple Wireless Keyboard (2003) (S/N M9270LL/A or A1016) to my 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro after update to Monterey 12.0.1. Here is how the problem unfolds:\n\n*\n\n*Device turned on and in 'Discovery' mode, it appears in the\n'Bluetooth' panel in 'System Preferences', in the list of unpaired\ndevices.\n\n*By clicking on 'Connect' button, nothing happens until 'Return' key\nis pressed.\n\n*Then, the panel indicating the 6-digit 'Passkey' appears (the\nPasskey being different each time) and then immediately disappears.\n\n*If no key is pressed though, the panel never appears and pairing\nsimply fails; then the Connect button is clickable again within\napproximately 20 seconds.\n\n*Device status in BT panel then indicates 'Passkey doesn't match' (as\nI was unable to enter the passkey anyway).\n\nI have tried turning Bluetooth off and on, rebooting Mac and reseting SMC+PRAM countless times, as well as replacing the batteries. Since I own two of these I tried with both and the problem is exactly the same. The two worked seamlessly on that computer before the update. I haven't got another computer to test them on unfortunately. My headphones, mouse and DualShock 4 controller pair and connect fine to that same computer since I don't have to enter any passkey. I would like to avoid having to downgrade to get my external keyboard to work if possible.\nPlease note that I was unable to reset the Bluetooth module or delete all devices since these options don't seem to be present anymore by opening Bluetooth menu in Menu Bar while pressing alt+shift after update to Monterey. To overcome this I sought various methods of doing the same by other means without any of them being helpful in the problem I'm encountering:\nHow to restart Bluetooth service from command line\nTo me, it simply seems to be a software bug of the UI. Update, see below I reported it to Apple through their bug report interface, though I'm not sure they ever read these.\nWith that said I would like to know if I'm the only one to encounter these UI problems, and if there's any way to bypass that passkey pairing. Thanks in advance,\nKind regards,\nEDIT: I tried pairing using blueutil in Terminal as per this post :\nPair with a Bluetooth device over Terminal\nHowever the same thing happens in terminal. Nothing happens until I press return. As soon as I press return, pairing immediately fails without giving me the opportunity to enter the passcode.

I'm planning to use target disk mode on my old computer and transfer manually.\nCan I use a regular old USB to USB-C cable (such as this: https://amzn.to/3mv4Arw) or would I need a different cable/adapter to connect the two computers using target disk mode?\n\nA: That cable should work fine as that is the method documented by Apple as a supported means to transfer data.  The link provided by @nohillside documents this, and I repeat it here in case of a deletion or edit and for sake of completeness: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlb37e8ca7/12.0/mac/12.0\nFor those with a similar concern on pre-M1 computers Apple documents the process here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1443/12.0/mac/12.0\nUSB should work fine for this, as should FireWire or Thunderbolt cables if that is what you have on hand.

I have a Macbook Air with the typical US keyboard layout printed in the keys, but I want to use the keyboard as if it were a Spanish keyboard because I'm accustomed to that layout and since I don't look at the keys while typing I don't mind the layout not matching the characters actually printed in the keys.\nThe layout of my keyboard looks exactly like this:\n\nI have configured the keyboard to behave as if it were an Spanish one, by going to Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and adding the \"Español - ISO\" layout.\nThat works fine, mostly, with one exception: The key at the left of the top \"1\" key (with the printed characters \"`~\") doesn't behave the same as the key in the same position in a Spanish keyboard, even after configuring the \"Español - ISO\" layout.\nInstead of the key being \"ºª\\\", which is the key at the left of \"1\" in the Spanish keyboard, it behaves as a \"<>≤\" key. Why is that?\nSo, since this is happening, I can't use those symbols (\"ºª\\\"), of which I miss the backslash the most. How can I get the backslash with this layout without having to switch to US keyboard just to get the backslash character (below the \"delete\" key), and then switching back to Spanish layout? (which is a cumbersome process just to get a single character each time).\nEdit: I think the problem is that the Spanish keyboard actually has an extra key that the US keyboard lacks (please note that the Left Shift key is shorter in the Spanish keyboard to accomodate the extra \"<>≤\" key).\n\nIt seems that, for some reason, the key at the left of the \"1\" key is actually moved (including its keycode) down to the right of the Left Shift key in European keyboards, and a completely new key with a new key code replaces the key at the left of the \"1\" (in the Spanish keyboard it is \"ºª\\\", while in other European languages it's a different set of symbols but the key code remains the same), so with a US keyboard I can't really have the full Spanish layout because of the missing key.\n\nA: You can always see what every key does with Keyboard Viewer.\nWith Spanish ISO, there is no backslash when you are using the US (ANSI) keyboard, you need the European ISO type.\nYou can make a custom layout which adds this character pretty easily with Ukelele.\nThe Apple layout \"Latin American\" has \\ at Option -\nThe Apple layout \"Spanish\" has \\ at Option 6.\n\nA: I finally found out that the problem is that the Spanish keyboard (and other European keyboards) actually has an extra key that the US keyboard doesn't have. Not only that, the key at the left of the \"1\" key has a different key code in European keyboards, because the key that is there in US keyboards was moved to the right of the Left Shift key in European keyboards (key code and everything), for reasons I can't comprehend. If the European keyboards have an extra key, why not assign a new key code to the new key, instead of replacing the key code of an existing key and then moving the old key code to the new key? I'm sure there must be a good reason for that, but I don't know it.\nSo, since the US keyboard has one less key, European people stuck with a laptop with a US keyboard can't really have the full layout of their language, so some compromises have to be made.\nI found several solutions that work for me:\n\n*\n\n*A little not-so-good solution because it only works on the Terminal: For some strange reason, pressing Alt+Y writes a backslash character ONLY in the Terminal application (in any other app it writes a yen ¥ symbol). It somewhat works for me because most of the time I need to write a backslash it's because I want to write an escape code in the Terminal (which begins with \"\\\"). But it's still not an ideal solution because I might need to write a backslash in other apps.\n\n\n*Using Karabiner Elements to remap the \"grave_accent_and_tilde (`)\" key (the key at the left of the \"1\" key in the US keyboard) to act as a \"non_us_backslash\" key (the key at the left of the \"1\" key in European keyboards). This works great, because I finally get access to the coveted backslash (\"\\\") character (as well as the \"º\" and \"ª\" numeral characters) but then I lose access to the \"<>≤\" characters in that key, which are very important, too, so this isn't a good solution either.\n\n\n*I can then remap the \"backslash (\\)\" key (the US keyboard \"\\|\" key located at the right of the keyboard above the \"enter\" key) to behave like the \"grave_accent_and_tilde (`)\" key with Spanish layout so I get the \"<>≤\" characters back in a different key while still keeping the \"ºª\\\" key functioning so those characters are also accessible in the keyboard as well. But then I lose the \"çÇ}\" characters! I don't mind losing \"ç\" and \"Ç\" since I don't use those letters, but losing access to the closing brace (\"}\") character is far from ideal as well, especially if you're a developer. It would seem I can never get a completely satisfactory solution.\n\n\n*I finally settled on remapping the \"caps_lock\" key to behave like the \"grave_accent_and_tilde (`)\" key, since I seldom use the Caps Lock key anyway (I only need to write single capital letters with Shift). That way I have access to both keys at the same time (\"ºª\\\" and \"<>≤\") without having to lose the \"çÇ}\" key in the process.\nThis is the best I have found, considering that the US keyboard has one less physical key than the number of keys I usually have, and the lack of a physical key of course can't be completely fixed with software workarounds.\nIf anyone has better ideas to solve this problem, please do comment.\n", "Q: Fully lost all documents after clearing trash My friend lost all her documents, downloads, and desktop files. The thing is that she lost the entire folders. When I go into her users there are shortcuts to the desktop, download and documents folders, but they do not go anywhere. She emptied her trash bin and she thought it was 3 files in it, but she saw 1500 files being deleted. I think she accidently moved her 3 folders into the trash, and was just using the shortcut in the users to access them.\nI tried using a disk recovery software but no files could be found. I think the index of documents has been deleted, but the files are still there. Time machine was not enabled, and icloud was not either.\nI'm kind of hoping for a special case where you can recover permanently deleted folders if their documents or desktop\n\nA: The thing with deleting files (unless you specifically do a \"secure erase\") is that the files are still there. What happens (over simplification warning here) is that the part of the disk on which the deleted files reside is marked as \"free.\" In other words as you use the computer, save files, move things around it is possible and even likely that that space will be used and the deleted files well and truly wiped out by being replaced by the new file.\nIt's like you parked your car at the mall and then lost it. It's still there you just don't know where it is and if you leave it there long enough it will get towed.\nThere are Mac utilities that purport to recover accidentally deleted files. I couldn't tell you how well they work and which are the worth the $$ you pay for the software and which are not. But I would imagine a quick online search for an \"un-delete\" or \"file recovery\" software for macOS would yield recommendations.\nThe thing to remember is that the more you use the Mac with the deleted files the less likely that you will be able to recover anything.\nAnd one more thing. There are companies that specialize in recovering lost data. Such services can be very expensive. It all depends on how much the lost data is worth.\n\nA: I know you said Time Machine wasn't enabled, but with modern macOS using the APFS file system, Time Machine may be using APFS local snapshots. See About Time Machine local snapshots.\nI know you said said iCloud Drive wasn't enabled, but I have seen instances where iCloud Drive was unknowingly enabled, and macOS moved the Desktop and Documents folders to ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ without creating the proper Finder Aliases to have them show up correctly in Finder. Use Terminal to check the contents of that folder.\n", "Q: What is this bluetooth keyboard and how can I make its Escape and F-keys work? I recently found this keyboard in hard rubbish. I really like the feel! I've had a lot of trouble finding a bluetooth keyboard that I like, so I'm motivated to try to make this one work.\n\n\nThere are absolutely no hints who the manufacturer is, what model it is, etc. It comes up in the Bluetooth settings as just \"Bluetooth keyboard\". It is powered by two AAA batteries. There is a battery/bluetooth indicator above the F11 key that goes green when turned on, and flashes green when pairing.\nUnderneath there is an on-off switch and a \"connect\" button. There is a very generic FCC compliance notice, and space for a serial number, but no serial number.\nThere are two major problems:\n\n*\n\n*the escape key (marked as a rounded rectangle symbol) does nothing unless the Fn key is held down\n\n*the F keys all perform their second function (volume up/down etc), even when the Fn key is down.\n\nAnd some real quirks with the F keys:\n\n\n\n\nKey\nWithout Fn\nWith Fn\n\n\n\n\nF1-F2\nScreen brightness up/down\nSame\n\n\nF3 (magnifying glass)\nNothing\nMission Control\n\n\nF4 (flower in a box)\nShort press: nothing.

(EDIT Looks very similar to this )\n\n*how can I make the Escape key work even without Fn? (Showstopper...)\n\n*is there a way to fix the issue with the Fn key not providing access to the F keys?\n\nWorst comes to worst, I'd probably be happy to buy a very similar keyboard to this one if it had the same feel but without the quirks. It feels like maybe this is a knock-off of some well-known brand, but it's actually pretty good (quirks aside).\n\nA: By using the Key Codes app, I can see that no key events are generated when pressing F1-F12 (other than F6, or Fn+F5 and Fn+F6), or when pressing Esc. So it seems unlikely any software solution can fix this?\nThe best workaround seems to be remapping Capslock to Esc as suggested here.\nBizarrely, the description on Amazon says:\n\n\nP.S.1: There is no Escape key for Macbook.\nP.S.2: This keyboard may not compatible well with the Windows 10, Mac mini, Macbook Pro, Moto RAZR or iPad Pro 10.5 2017\n\n(My emphasis)\nThis is a keyboard designed for use with Macs (it has the control/alt/command keys etc), and yet it \"may not compatible well with...Mac mini, Macbook Pro\". What are they even saying, it only works well with iMac and Macbook Air? Crazy. Why would that even be the case?\n", "Q: Not able to use VPN since upgrading to macOS Monterey As the title suggests, I upgraded my mac to Monterey today, and since then I am not able to use any VPN on it.\nNo idea why that's the case, I tried HMA (Hide My Ass) and Nord. In my networks, it says that VPN is connected, but the internet doesn't work.\nI am using a 13\" MacBook Pro 2018 and the VPN connect - but then no application that goes to the internet works.\nDo I need to select a VPN provider that can support me or is this an easy fix for general VPN?\n\nA: Try disabling Private Relay (System Peferences > Apple ID > iCloud > Private Relay).\nmacOS Monterey comes with a new feature called Private Relay which routes traffic through an Apple relay so your Mac has different IP address as seen from the WAN side. The aim of this is to protect your privacy. However, VPN services can be confused by the changing IP addresses.\nAlso see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614\n\nA: If your VPN (L2TP over IPSec) works properly but you cannot connect to the internet. This is what helped me out. The solution is to add the Google's DNS server to your DNS list.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\" selected\n\n\n\n\n*In addition to the IP that you probably can see here grayed out.

I cannot speak any language besides English, so all the other built in languages in many apps (including built in apps) serve no purpose on my disk. Is it safe to delete them, or will the app try to find them for whatever reason and panic and break if they are not found?\nWould it be safe to delete the selected files in Safari.app/Contents/Resources?\n\nA: Up to macOS 10.14 Mojave, it's mostly safe to delete any unwanted *.lproj folders — and also unwanted folders in a locale/ folder. As you say, that can bring big wins in disk space, as language-specific resources form a significant part of the disk usage of many apps.\nBut there are some caveats:\n\n*\n\n*A few resources are not language-specific, and must not be deleted, e.g. Base.lproj/base.lproj, Codes, Maketext, and (possibly) OpenCL.strings.lproj.  (Those are the only ones I've seen, but there may of course be many others.)\n\n*A very small number of apps check and refuse to start if any files are changed, e.g. Amadeus Pro, iPartition, and the Sparkle framework. (Again, there may be many others.)\n\n*System Integrity Protection (SIP) prevents you from changing system apps. (It does no harm to try; you just get an error.)\n\nI wrote a script to remove unwanted language files, which I've used for many years. For safety, it deletes only language folders it recognises and knows aren't needed; it leaves any English files along with those mentioned above, and shows a warning for any it doesn't recognise. (I learned that the hard way, when an earlier OS upgrade first introduced Base.lproj and my previous script broke everything…)\nI can't yet vouch for macOS 10.15 Catalina or above — though early indications on macOS 12 Monterey suggest that the same may apply there too.\n", "Q: Playing League of Legends on an external monitor with Apple silicon (display glitchiness) I just bought myself a 14\" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro), which I use as my personal computer, including for casually playing League of Legends (a popular MOBA game).\nI am connected to an external display (LG UltraFine 4K 24MD4KL-B) and some external peripherals (mouse, keyboard).\nLeague of Legends runs via Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon macs, and runs perfectly fine on the built-in display. I run into some issues, however, when connecting my external display: input lag, screen stutter/flaky pixels/glitchy display (I can provide a video to illustrate).\nThe weird thing is, disconnecting and reconnecting the thunderbolt cable once in-game solves the issue: display becomes pristine, there's no discernible input lag, everything works perfectly. However, this workaround causes the OS to malfunction post-game: application switching no longer works, and subsequent games load into a black screen. A restart solves the issue (but it means I have to restart my machine after every game).\nThis is kind of a frustrating issue, so I wonder if anyone has faced a similar problem or knows of a potential fix? Also, I don't know which part of the chain is to blame in this: the game itself? macOS Monterey? Rosetta 2?

This app's sole purpose is to prevent the computer from going to sleep when you don't want it too. One of the things it is capable of is conditional sleep prevention. To set this up install the app then in the apps preferences page go the \"Triggers\" add a new trigger using the \"+\" button. Name the trigger. Then add the criterion \"audio output\" using the \"+\". Then find the HDMI audio output in the drop down box and you're done. (Note: The HDMI audio output might not show up if you are not connected to your TV) Hope this Helps.\nEdit: To increase the granularity of the control, you can add multiple condition in the trigger so that all conditions must be met for it to enable. The application trigger will limit it to only if the web browser is open (with a toggle to specify if it needs to be frontmost)(As this isn't perfect you can use another browser to play  the music other than your standard browser to avoid unwanted activation) and if you still want even more granularity you can use CPU utilization as a sort of proxy of the app playing audio. (though this will be inconsistent and would only work if the web browser uses a relatively significant amount of resources while playing music to distinguish it from background activity). Hope these possible workarounds help.\n", "Q: My MacBook connects to my TV through Airplay by itself, all the time My Macbook Pro M1, keeps on connecting to my TV through Airplay, without my consent.

At the same time, she decided to switch to Safari after years of using Firefox. But something is driving her mad: when she types search terms into the address bar and hits Return, instead of doing a Google search, nothing happens. It says “Google Search” right there in the address bar, and search suggestions appear in the dropdown, but it doesn't matter how many times she presses Return, nothing happens.\nI've never seen this happen before in all my years of using Safari. Some Googling suggested turning off Safari search suggestions in Preferences, but that didn't help. Any other ideas? She's running Safari version 14.1.2 on Big Sur, and has no extensions installed.\n\nA: I would make a new user account so you can see the default settings in safari and also be prompted for any extensions that may be present.\nOnce you validate the app functions properly in a new user account, you can start looking at extensions or settings issues on the existing account.\n", "Q: Older relative knows but cannot type her iCloud password correctly My 85 year old great aunt, who lives on the other side of the country, cannot type her iCloud password correctly after her iPhone was auto updated to iOS 15. I checked her password on iCloud.com, so that’s not the problem. I repeated it character by character, confirming that she had capitalization correct, and ended up with the correct number of dots after finishing.\nNo luck. After this failed four times, I told her to take it and the carefully-checked password to the trustworthy local branch of her mobile service provider to type in for her on Monday, because she needs to have a cellphone before we’d next see her!\nAny tips for older relatives who cannot quite type things exactly any more, and live too far away for us to intervene on short notice?

I have used homebrew to install both Vim and MacVim on my mac. Right now, MacVim is the one that is linked. When I run mvim --version, I get the most recent and installed version that appears. When I run vim --version, the one pre-installed on the computer comes up, even though Vim has been installed via homebrew and is fully up to date. How can I make it so both mvim and vim link to their respective homebrew installed version, rather than only mvim with vim not being up to date, or vim with mvim not working?\n\nA: To expand on @mmmmmm's comment, run echo $PATH in your terminal. Make sure homebrew's path, which is /opt/homebrew/bin on M1/Apple Silicone Macs and /usr/local/bin on Intel Macs, is before your system's /usr/bin\nAlso run cat .zprofile or open your .zprofile in your editor of choice. Make sure you have a line like: eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\" (M1/Apple Silicone) or eval \"$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)\" (Intel).

I’m working through the 2021 release of Adobe Photoshop Classroom in a Book for my digital imaging class. One of the lessons is on the Mixer Brush tool. I decided to connect my Mac to my iPad Pro using Sidecar so that I could use my Apple Pencil (I find it easier to use than my mouse for these types of tasks).\nIt worked fine at first, but eventually I ran into an issue where my brush strokes looked nothing like what the textbook showed. I tried switching to my mouse, and it solved the issue. As far as I can tell, the input device is the only difference; the settings should be the same. I’ve included screenshots showing the results I’m getting and my brush settings. In case it helps, I’ve also added a couple of pictures of the relevant page in the textbook. Also, my Apple Pencil is the 2nd generation version.\nCan anyone tell me why I’m getting different results with the Apple Pencil?

SPD information is read by firmware at system boot time and that information is then handed over to the OS using ACPI. macOS's xnu kernel stores and publishes ACPI data using IORegistry.\nSystem Profiler reads ACPI data via IORegistry's IODeviceTree plane. You can view all the published properties of your DRAM with the following command:\nioreg -p IODeviceTree -n memory -r\n\nWhatever strings are stored in the dimm-manufacturer and dimm-part-number fields here will be the same as those shown by System Profiler.\nIf these fields are missing or have 0 / Unknown values, this may be either:\n\n*\n\n*The result of that SPD data being absent from the EEPROM, in which case it is the manufacturer's fault; or\n\n*Due to a bug in the firmware's platform-dependent memory reference code, which is specific to a particular Mac hardware product version (e.g., iMac20,1 in your case) and often contains bugs that are specific to just that product version due to the proportionally lower amount of testing and engineering exposure that any given product version gets relative to the entire family. In this case it would be Apple's fault.\n\nA way to discern between (1) and (2) would be to install the same DRAM in another system that is compatible with that kind of DRAM but which is not an iMac20,1. If you see valid values, then it's Apple's bug and should be reported to them. If not, reach out to OWC and see if this is expected behavior.\n", "Q: Mac Mini M1 with three monitors As you know the Mac Mini M1 has one HDMI, 2 USB-C connectors.  Currently I connected two monitors to it via the HDMI and through one of the USB-C port.\nSo what happens if I connect another monitor to the 2nd USB-C port?  Will it provide me a third display?\n\nA: As documented, the Mac mini M1 supports two external monitors.\nhttps://www.apple.com/mac-mini/specs/\n\nA: The M1 chips support a total of two monitors. For the Mac Mini, that means two external monitors. For the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro (M1, not M1 Pro or Max), that means the internal monitor and one external monitor.\nYou can use a DisplayLink USB Virtual Graphics Card to use more external displays. Note however that this requires a driver installation that may break when macOS updates, and it doesn't use the M1's native graphics card.\n\nA: My simple workaround with the tools I had available:\n1 Monitor via HDMI\n1 Monitor via USB-C to HDMI\n1 Monitor via Airplay to Apple TV\nI had a spare apple tv I wasn't using so I gave it a go. Note it is a fresh desktop and NOT mirrored, unlike many posts were suggesting.\nI do know there are other more optimal solution but I'd be willing to bet more people have a apple tv laying out than hub/splitter/etc.\nHope that helps those in a pinch.\n", "Q: Character combinations appearing on the terminal when certain key-combinations are pressed When I hold the Shift- and the Ctrl-Key on the keyboard and press the arrow-keys, then character-combinations are shown on the screen: ;6D;6A;6C;6B\nWhat's the meaning of these characters ;NumberLetter?\n\nA: The input on a terminal is a sequence of characters (or more precisely a sequence of bytes). Non-printable input, such as function and arrow keys, has to be encoded as one or more characters. A few keys are encoded as control characters, for example ^I (HT, Ctrl+I) for the Tab key. But there aren't nearly enough control characters to encode all key combinations. So function keys and cursor keys are encoded as sequences of multiple characters. In practice, all terminals use escape sequences that start with the character ESC (Escape, ^[) followed by some printable characters. The details of the encoding can vary between terminals and can depend on the terminal configuration.\nEscape sequences have a variable length, so the only way to know when one ends is to know how it's constructed. If the application running in the terminal (for example the shell) recognizes the escape sequence as a key chord, it invokes whatever functionality is bound to that key chord. If the application doesn't recognize the escape sequence, there's a point where it gives up and treats subsequent characters as ordinary characters.\nThe de facto standard encoding for cursor keys is that Up sends ^[[A (where ^[ means an escape character, not the two-character sequence circumflex-bracket), Down sends ^[[B, Right sends ^[[C and Left sends ^[[D. Modifiers are indicated with a semicolon and a number, and for cursor keys an extra 1 before the semicolon. The number 6 indicates the modifiers Ctrl+Shift. See this answer for more details.\nWhen you press Ctrl+Shift+Left, the terminal sends ^[[1;6D (recall that ^[ is an escape character here). The shell reads ^[[1 and, at that point, notices that none of its key bindings start with these three characters. So it gives up (and it might beep if it's configured to beep when it receives invalid input). It keeps reading and sees ;6D which are ordinary printing characters.\nTo see what escape sequence your terminal sends for a given key or key chord, press Ctrl+V then the key chord. Ctrl+V (^V) is a key binding in shells and other terminal applications that means “treat the next character literally”, and that causes the leading escape character in the escape sequence to be inserted literally, followed by the other characters in the escape sequence (which are ordinary printing characters). If you want to bind that key chord in your shell or other terminal application, you need to bind this escape sequence.\nAs I noted above, there are differences between terminals. There's a de facto standard for simple cases, but less so when modifiers are involved. Furthermore many terminals simply ignore certain modifiers on certain keys. For example, on Big Sur terminal, Ctrl+Shift+cursor key is indistinguishable from cursor key by default; this can be configured in the preferences (“Profiles” > “Keyboard”)). Iterm2 comes with more escape sequences out of the box including Ctrl+Shift+cursor key.\nFurther reading:\n\n*\n\n*Difference between a terminal and a shell\n\n*How do keyboard input and text output work?

I bought a DELL U2720Q 4k monitor to see text clearly as my last one (Acer XV272U) was not doing the job. After installing the U2720Q, I found that I need to scale in Display to see larger text but then macOS says \"looks like 2560x1440\".\nIs the display really scaled down to 2560x1440 or is it still 4k? I want to run on full 4k resolution but with larger fonts. How do I achieve that?\n\n\nA: Yes, that setting would use the full 4k resolution of the monitor - but everything will be scaled to look like 2560x1440.\nYou can often check whether or not the full 4k resolution is being used by activating the on-screen-menu on the monitor using the physical buttons on the monitor.\nNote that settings you're changing here does not \"just\" adjust the font size. You can adjust font size in word processors, browsers, etc. without changing the display scaling as you're doing here. When you adjust display scaling, you're adjusting the size of most things on screen - i.e. also buttons, window frames, etc.\nYou mention that you're having problems seeing text \"clearly\". You should be aware that you have chosen a resolution that won't divide perfectly into the monitor's resolution, and thus you're not getting optimal \"clarity\".\nI.e. your monitor is set to run at 3840x2160 resolution currently. If you output a 3840x2160 signal to it, it will display pixel perfect - but everything will of course be somewhat small in comparison (27\" could be considered a large display, but for some even that will seem small).\nIf you scale your user interface to look like 1920x1080, it can be thought of as double every pixel in width and height. I.e. every pixel becomes 4 pixels, and as such would be \"clear\" on the display. This is not exactly what happens as some things aren't doubled as such - instead text, videos, etc. are rendered at high resolution.\nIn your case, you have chosen your scaling to have it look like 2560x1440. That means a non-integer factor between that resolution and output resolution of 3840x2160. I.e. this means that every pixel becomes a cube of 1.5 pixels width and height. As that is not physically possible (you can't actually display half a pixel), this means that the graphics is actually rendered at a higher resolution and then downsampled to what your display is actually capable off. This comes at the cost of \"clarity\".\n", "Q: Restoring M1 Mac without (or with 100% worn) SSD I just wondered, in case you have 100% worn SSD is it possible to turn on your Mac and reinstall macOS to another drive?\n\nA: Yes, you can boot the M1 Mac from an external Thunderbolt 3 drive.\nAttach your Thunderbolt 3 drive to an M1 Mac, erase the drive and format as APFS with Disk Utility, and then run the macOS installer, selecting the external drive as the target, and install.\nIf you haven't got a working M1, you can use the M1 Mac that won't boot from the internal drive, by powering it up while pressing and holding (long press) the power button. When you get the startup menu, click the Options icon and \"Disk Utility\" in order to erase and format the external drive as APFS - and then from the Options menu select \"Reinstall macOS\" to install macOS.\nAfter installation, you can use the external drive to boot the M1 Mac that hasn't got a SSD drive. When you power on the M1 Mac, you need to long press the power button until the display shows the startup menu.

How does Mac Mail's \"unsubscribe\" feature work ?\nBy the unsubscribe feature, i mean the feature as per the screenshot attached.\nEg. Does it follow the unsubscribe link that was sent in the email, or does it just add the sender to a \"junk\" list ? If the latter how can we ensure non \"newsletter\" messages from this sender dont go to junk.\nIm running Mac OS Big Sur, but ive also noticed a similar feature in recent versions of iOS.\n\n\nA: Apple's Mail app looks for the list-unsubscribe header which contains the mailto: address to unsubscribe from a specific list.  Not all senders include this in their emails which is why not all emails have the 'unsubscribe' link.\nMail then creates a simple email from your address and sends the 'unsubscribe' email for you.  This is the same process as if you would send an email yourself to unsubscribe from that list.\nThe benefit to the email sender is that by using the unsubscribe link, you're less likely to mark the email as spam on your email service provider (which negatively impacts the sender's email reputation) or send a complaint to the government entity responsible for monitoring spam (in the US it's the FTC).\n", "Q: Apple music : what does \"sync library\" actually do? I have just subscribed to the Apple Music service.\nI want to be able to create a playlist from songs on Apple Music that are not necessarily in my Library (to save on space).\nHowever, when I try to add a song to a playlist, it asks me to \"Sync your library\".\nMy current setup is that I have many many songs on my mac, and I have just a subset of them on my iPhone. I fear that turning on syncing in that way will change that. Hence my question : what does Syncing your library actually do?\n\n*\n\n*Does it send all my songs to my iCloud drive? If so, it is undesirable to me to use my iCloud storage for my songs\n\n\n*Does it really make my library identical on my mac and my iPhone? That seems very undesirable also, due to the low disk space on my iPhone.\n\n\n*Is there no workaround?\n\nA: It is a bit unbelievable, but there is no exact information available from Apple apart from: just turn it on.\nWhen I switched on Sync Library in Music preferences/general it uploaded my songs to Apple. It does not count against your iCloud disk size. My library was quite big +100GB. Lower quality songs were replaced with better quality songs. Albums that are not on Apple Music are uploaded and are available to all your devices after upload. But some albums are incomplete after the sync. I don't know why. Meta data also was replaced. So, better have a backup ready. But I think the original files on your drive should(?) be safe. But the Library will definitely be altered.

With the introduction of iOS 15 and focus mode, I have once again wished that I could find a simple way (on a standard, non-jailbroken iPhone) to temporarily silence all sounds, including alarms, for some period of time.\nThe main use case here, is that I have a lot of daily alarms that are always set, but some times, I am at the theater or in a special meeting, where I do not want them to go off. Turning the alarms off and on, or giving them a silent ringtone, is not really a viable option.\nI'd love a control panel switch or focus mode setting that could handle this, if there was one. A fancy shortcut automation might be an option, but I'm guessing that it would still be a bit difficult to make generic enough and reliable.\nUsing a non-Apple app for Alarms, might be one possible approach, as I think that would be silenced, but that solution isn't ideal since most of my workflow relies on the built in alarm functionality at the moment.\nDoes anyone know how to accomplish this (now or in the future)?\nEDIT: Although the list of active, recurring alarms does not change all the time, it does change frequently enough, that I'd prefer a solution that could silence all enabled alarms and then un-silence that same list without needing to maintain the list, simply because it will be error prone.\nAs much as I like Apple products in general, the lack of a real \"theater\" silent mode in 2021 is completely baffling.\n\nA: Using shortcuts is a manageable way of doing it. You can use the \"toggle alarm\" shortcut to activate and deactivate your alarms and the get all alarms to provide all your alarms to the toggle. If you only want a subset of your alarms toggled then this shortcut will toggle the alarms based on the alarms' names specified in a list.\n", "Q: OS X 10.11 VM can't accept tracing from DTrace (for example trying to crash it with 'sudo dtrace -w -n \"BEGIN{ panic();}\"') Something keeps me from tracing on OS X El Capitan using DTrace (for example crashing it with sudo dtrace -w -n \"BEGIN{ panic();}\").\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: You need to disable System Integrity Protection in order to be able to trigger a kernel panic.\n", "Q: Why we can’t to install virtual machine at iPad Pro with M1 chip? We know the iPad use the same chip of the Mac Pro, but I don’t understand why we can’t to install the virtual machine at the iPad Pro, recently I buy this device but now I’m a little sorry kkkk\n\nA: So there are two main types of VMS: (1) system virtual machines and (2) process virtual machines.\nSystem VMs utilize a hypervisor to \"use native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine\". So while the M1 chip itself is fully capable of supporting that, iPadOS isn't, so unless Apple adds support for this, these will be impossible on iPadOS. Even if you jailbreak it, it would be a considerably difficult task to accomplish since the OS was not designed with hypervisors in mind, and thus will not handle some of its resources being taken away from it well.\nOn the other hand, process virtual machines \"are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment\" and \"run as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process\". So not only can these exist on iPadOS, but they do exist on iPadOS: ish and UTM are a couple that you can use (though UTM no longer works without jailbreak after iOS 13 due to Apple's sandboxing features, and no jailbreak exists for iOS 15 yet, so would have to use iOS 14 jailbroken or iOS 11 - 13.) While they both use emulation, ish uses some tricks that allow it to be 3-5x faster than pure emulation, though ish is just a Linux shell. UTM also uses some tricks to make it faster than pure emulation, and it supports Windows and Linux, but would also require a jailbreak for your iPad.\nSo unfortunately there's no fast, convenient way of using a VM on your M1 iPad (unless a Linux shell is all you need). If you need to use a desktop OS from your iPad, for the time being you'll need to connect to one remotely either through some SSH, VNC, RDP, etc. app or through the browser.\n", "Q: MacOS - Backing up iBooks highlights and notes when switching to new laptop I have been using iBooks for reading epub books/files in my work laptop. I'll be switching to a different Mac laptop sometime soon.\nI can copy/backup the epub files. But, for backing up the highlights and notes, what are the folders/files I need to copy (backup from old laptop and restore in new laptop).\nUPDATE: I cannot use iCloud since it is blocked by my company.

(Do I need to log out or something for it to take effect?)\nPlease note that I do not want to use this as a default layout for all Finder windows.\n\nA: Yes, what you are trying to do is possible. I've been down this rabbit hole deep, trying to code a CLI tool by manipulating the .DS_Store files directly using the reverse-engineering done by Perl coders over at CPAN (https://metacpan.org/dist/Mac-Finder-DSStore/view/DSStoreFormat.pod). I gave up this route because every version of macOS has differences in the format, and nothing has official documentation and the unofficial one is incomplete AFAIK.\nWhat will work, across macOS iterations, is using Automator.\nI will make a fundamental assumption, and that is that your large number of folders either is or can be [temporarily] put in a single master folder. Let's call it /Users/me/TEMPLATE. If not, and your folders are scattered around in some other way, you first need to compile a list of those paths. This list can then be used to script temporarily moving all the folders to TEMPLATE and then move them back. Or, perhaps by using Finder aliases or posix symlinks to avoid actually moving the folders. Ufortunately, macOS will not allow you to create hard links to folders. That would be easiest, but is disallowed to avoid infinite recursion. You can work around this mounting your file system on linux if you want.\nUsing Automator:\n\n*\n\n*Open your TEMPLATE folder in Finder, which now one way or another contains all your folders you want to change the view for.\n\n\n*Set the view to \"LIST\" view, and rearrange everything in this view according to your desires.\n\n\n*Hit CMD+J for View options, then check \"Always open in List view\". Close this info box.\n\n\n*Open Automator, hit CMD+N, new Workflow\n\n\n*Drag in the action Get Specified Finder Items\n\n\n*Drag your TEMPLATE folder in to the Get Specified Finder Items action\n\n\n*Drag in the action Set Folder Views under the first action\n\n\n*You see these two actions are now connected. The metadata from the TEMPLATE folder is now inherited to the Set Folder Views UI.\n\n\n*There is even more metadata passing through here than what the developers of Automator has made UI elements for. You have to experiment to see. Most importantly, do check the box for [X] Apply Changes to Subfolders.\n\n\n*Run the workflow by hitting CMD+R.\nThis will propagate your view to all the subfolders. You might need to move your set of folders back again if you temporarily scripted moving them. If you do, please take note that which tool you use to alter macOS file systems do so in different ways. The Finder is the most compatible, either manually or scripted with osascript or Automator. From the command line, using an updated version of rsync is very flexible using the right flags. Do some tests first to see whether you can use mv, cp, or ditto on Folders directly and whether those successfully also moves over your ds_store metadata accordingly or not!\nMake a backup first! :)\n", "Q: How can I install a whole new key (keycap, hinge, membrane) on a 2019 MBP?

I would like to close all Finder windows but keep the active one open – included keeping all its tabs open also. AppleScript are from Mars and it seems I’m from Venus, but\nI’ve found some ready made scripts around the web. I get them all to close all windows and keep the active window open, but they also close the tabs of the active window.\nI'm on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7\nHere’s some of the scripts I’ve tried.

This is also an unfortunate consequence of there not being a tab as a property, element or class for a tab in a  window in Finder.\n Note that terms used in the paragraphs above shown as, e.g. window are referring to them programmatically and shown as e.g. window are referring to them at the UI level.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above, was tested in Script Editor under every version of macOS from macOS Sierra to macOS Monterey with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: I can't find a way to distinguish a tab from a window. Is there any? Maybe not. As bmike mentioned, a tab is a window. If Finder's windows have identical window positions and identical window sizes there's high probability that the window is a tab. However that's not always true.\nThe following script will work as long as two windows dont have identical windows positions:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set frontPosition to (position of (front window))\n    set frontBounds to (bounds of (front window))\n    \n    repeat with i from (count of windows) to 1 by -1\n        if (frontPosition ≠ (position of (window i)) or frontBounds ≠ (bounds of (window i))) then\n            close window i\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: The following produces a list of all windows.

Usually, the connection from a wired or bluetooth mic to an iPhone is for telephony, which does not require a stereo audio signal.\nThis page at Apple Developer shows how to enable stereo microphone input, but only, it seems, from within an iOS app coded to do so. I've seen no Setting in iOS to change to Stereo.\nAn iPhone feedback submission to Apple may be a first step making Apple aware of the necessity of providing user control of the built-in mics.\n", "Q: Advanced search in Apple Notes I have about 10k notes in Apple Notes on my MacBook and I was wondering if there is a way just to search for titles, instead of the note contents?\nIn earlier versions of the program the results were sorted so that title results came first, but this seems to be no longer the case.\n\nA: This is a slightly awkward solution, but it might work with a bit of tweaking: a shortcuts workflow that asks for a text (or gets it when started via context-menu etc.) and uses the appropriate search notes. action.\nYou should be able to load my action via https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d72c594e1617429a9c3dbae1ea682289.

I just got a MacBook Pro with the new M1 chip. I'd like to use native Apple Silicon code wherever possible.\nI have a Java-based command-line program running and I noticed that this java process in Activity Monitor is of type 'Intel'.\nThe process's path is /usr/bin/java, which is supposed to be a Universal binary:\n$ file /usr/bin/java\n/usr/bin/java: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64e:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e]\n/usr/bin/java (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n/usr/bin/java (for architecture arm64e):    Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e\n\nSo why is it running in Intel mode, and how can I run it natively?\n\nA: /usr/bin/java is not the Java runtime. It is a wrapper that will launch a Java runtime. You can determine which Java runtime/JDK you're actually using by examining java --version.\nJava versions are typically installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines.

I'm confused about what the 0.5x, 1x, 3x buttons do in the Camera app on my iPhone 13 Pro. I had assumed that they were how I specified which lens I was using (what Apple misleadingly calls optical zoom) — i.e., they were how I selected the Ultra Wide, Wide, and Telephoto lenses, respectively.\nThis assumption is reenforced by the focal length indications on the focus dial, where for example 77 mm (Telephoto) is indicated at 3x.\nBut sometimes (in low light?) I get a different lens. For example I'll get the Wide less when I chose 3x.\nWhat do the 0.5x, 1x, 3x buttons do? If they don't select a lens, is there a way to do that?\n\nA: They indicate zoom levels.\nThe lens chosen will be selected to obtain the best photograph. In some lighting situations, the photo quality from cropping the 1x lens to 3x will be higher than the quality from the 3x lens.\n\nA: The buttons indicate the default zoom for each of the attached cameras. Here is my iPhone 11 Pro with the 0.5 / 1 / 2 controls visible. For me they select the lens and I confirmed this by mounting my camera on a tripod and taking three photos with the native app and three photos with Halide app and comparing the photo metadata.\n\nIf you swipe your finger between them and watch carefully, you can see the digital / sensor zoom transition from the default view and then slide in the new camera image as you reach each point.\n\n\nA: Despite the indication of focal lengths on the zoom ring, suggesting that the values correspond to selection of one of the phone's three physical lenses, the numbers just indicate the zoom factor that will be used, possibly by selecting the corresponding lens, but also possibly through digital cropping. As a user, you have no control over how the zoom level is accomplished, you simply have to trust Apple AI.\nIf you want selection of one of these values to work as you might expect (based for example on Apple's own UX and documentation) you will in fact need to use a different camera app, many of which adopt a philosophy more targeted at photographers:\n\nDigital zoom is just a software effect that throws out pixels. Most photographers prefer to crop the full image later in editing. Accidentally triggering pinch-to-zoom, and then losing pixels, would be very annoying.\n\n", "Q: Prevent MacBook Pro (clamshell mode) from sleeping when KVM switches to a different computer I have a setup of a Mac Mini and a MacBook Pro connected to a KVM switch that allows me to share my monitors, mouse and keyboard between both of them by pushing a single button.\nWhen I switch to the MacBook Pro, the Mac mini stays put. When I switch back I see my desktops or maybe the screensaver.\nWhen I switch to the Mac mini, the MacBook Pro immediately goes to sleep. When I switch back I have to wake it up (takes a while).\nMy guess is that this is happening because since the KVM is showing the contents of the Mac mini to the monitors, the MacBook Pro is kinda like if it's closed with no monitor attached.\nHow can I prevent it from going to sleep?\n\nA: Use Amphetamine and remember to uncheck the \"allow system sleep when display is closed\" option.\n\nA: The issues are caused by the KVM switch does not provide full-time EDID emulation/feeding to all connected systems (both your Linux system and MacBook).\nSo, each time you want to make a switch to different connected systems or if the monitor connections are under power saving time-out, you will need to re-boot or replug cables to make re-initial the video bus communications between your shared monitor and connected systems.\nIt's a very command problem with most of the KVM switches not supporting EDID feeding functions.\nFind a DDM-class KVM switch will solve the issues.\n", "Q: Java JDK 8/11/17 All Crashing on MacOS Monterey (12.0.1) It appears using Oracle SQL Developer will eventually crash Java on JDK 8, 11 or 17 when using macOS Monterey (12.0.1).

I need to get it out of the iCloud so I can download a refreshed version.  How do I permanently delete it from the iCloud?\n\nA: The cloud symbol in the App Store only indicates that you already bought the app. Redownloading it gives you the same version as people get which buy it fresh.\n", "Q: App Privacy in App Store How reliable is the information on the application's page in the App Privacy section about not collecting data? Can it be checked?\n\nA: The information is provided solely by the app developer. You will also notice that Apple introduces the section with the following text:\n\"The developer, XXX, indicated that the app's privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.\"\nThere's no automated checking of whether that information is factually correct.\nMy understanding is Apple does not actively check every app for compliance with what's reported here. Instead, if it comes to Apple's attention that the developer has provided false or misleading information here, Apple has retained the right to remove the app or even all the developer's apps from the App Store.\nThe threat of being removed from the App Store, as well as the PR nightmare it would cause if false information was provided here, probably works as a deterrent for most developers.\n", "Q: How to fix one glitchy key (the 'r' key is wonky) The r key on my work laptop has developed an annoying behavior:\n\n*\n\n*sometimes the letter r does not appear when I type it\n\n*other times, the letter r appears out of order in a word, such as wodr\n\n*sometimes, the letter r repeats without me typing it twice\n\nThis happens in browser, emacs, terminal.\nSo it seems like this letter (and only this letter) is sometimes going into the queue in the wrrong order.

I get this discrepancy regardless of the camera (my current iPhone, my previous iPhone, others' iPhones) used to take the photo.\nWhat does the macOS information mean? Why is it different from what's displayed on iOS.\n\nA: I took a photo with iPhone 12 Pro, synced via iCloud to Mac, then checked the metadata using the Photos app on iPhone and Mac. Both showed 'Telephoto Camera - 52mm f2'. However, I have seen iPhone metadata screen showing 'back triple camera 9mm f/2.8'. The iPhone 13 Pro has a triple-lens rear camera with an f/2.8 Telephoto lens, an f/1.5 Wide lens, and an f/1.8 Ultra Wide lens. So it seems your iPhone is showing you which lens was actually used for the shot, while the Mac is showing the generic description.\nIn the Photos SQL database, this metadata is stored in the ZEXTENDEDATTRIBUTES table. For my test photo, this table's ZLENSMODEL column says 'iPhone 12 Pro back triple camera...', while the aperture and focal length information is stored in the ZAPERTURE and ZFOCALLENGTHIN35MM columns.

According to what I can find in settings, it is 16-bit. Usually there are more options than this. I've heard online that this is Apple's fault for including bad drivers, but I am wondering if there is a way around it or some third-party drivers that I can install. I've tried re downloading the drivers and looking through all of the settings. There is an enhance option which only seems to make the sound louder which then makes it sound worse. I've looked through 12 pages of Google searches and I can't find any fixes. Any help, ideas or suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: Nothing wrong with 16 bit and 48000 Hz output, that's actually a bit better than CD quality and +100% as much as your ear can hear anyway. The audio drivers Apple provides are more or less alright as well (refer to P.S. if you need details).\nThe problem is macOS has built-in system-wide equalization of sound and Windows does not (also no sound enhancements are built-in to driver). So use Dolby Atmos app to crank up lows and lower highs or simply go for this Equalizer APO preset (it will override Dolby Atmos if you have it). Don't forget to check Use audio enhancement tickbox in your screenshot if you'll use any system-wide equalizer.\nP.S. In case you'll hear random pop sound during media playback while using any equalizer (Dolby Atmos, Equalizer APO, etc.) - that's a known issue, no fix so far both for Windows and macOS.

Also, since there is no good chat app in Nintendo Switch(they only have it for a few games via a smartphone app), having both Discord and the Switch game audio would be great.\n\nA: This question has been asked and answered many times before here at Ask Different. The best I can do is post this answer and give links to other answers.\nUpdated Answer\nIn your comments, you referenced the inability to hear the sound from the MacBook air. This problem has also been addressed by the question \"How can I play the sound from the audio in through my speakers?\". Evidently, there was a noticeable delay when using many (if not all) of the solutions posted in the answers. This updated answer attempts to avoid digitally mixing the two audio signals.\nI assume you already have analog line level output from both the Nintendo Switch and PS5. The devices mentioned in my original answer can provide analog line level output from the Mac. However, I believe the headphone output on your Mac could be substituted for an analog line level output, if the output level was set low enough. Below is an example of a powered headphone amplifier which can combine analog line level inputs and provide output to your earbuds.\nDonner DEL-8i2 4-Channel Stereo Line Headphone Mixer\n\n\nMy Original Answer\nYou need to purchase a device that has line in ports and can plug into one of your Mac's existing USB-C ports.

These are ordered by lowest list price first.\n\n*\n\n*Behringer U-Phono UFO202 Audiophile USB/Audio Interface with Built-in Phono Preamp,Black\nWhile this model will solve your problem, there is also a phonograph preamp, which you may have another use for.\n\n\n\n*BEHRINGER A- B Box, 2 x RCA Phono (UCA202)\nWhile this model will solve your problem, there is also an optical digital output, which you may have another use for.\n\n\n\n*Behringer U-Control UCA222 Ultra-Low Latency 2 In/2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output\nWhile this model will solve your problem, there is also an optical digital output and additional software, which you may have another use for.\n\nTo use one of the above device, you will need the following:\n\n*\n\n*An adaptor to go from the device's USB-A jack to your Mac's USB-C port.\n\n*An adaptor to go from the female 3.5mm port to the device's two RCA line in ports.\n\nUCA202 Versus UCA222\nThe comparison below was taken from the article \"Behringer UCA202 vs UCA222\" by admin; published July 4, 2019 at Recordingbro.com.\n\n\"Physically, both of them are identical models with the latter being a newer model but, there is something that sets them apart and probably what most important when considering these interface. As an older model, UCA202 comes with a free and open source Audacity as well as Kreative’s Kristal Audio Engine. On the other hand, Behringer UCA222 is packed with those two but also added with EnergyXT2.5 or the Compact Behringer Edition as well as another disk with more than 100 virtual instruments and 50+ plug-ins.\"\n\nLinks\n\n*\n\n*This question is for a different Mac, but problem is the same: How to accept USB as audio input for New Macbook Pro Retina?

When I tap on a link in iOS I get a range of different results:\n\n*\n\n*Link opens in a link related app (e.g. The Guardian app for a theguardian.com link)\n\n*Link opens in Safari, either (a) with or (b) without a suggestion to open in a link-related app\n\n*Link opens in Safari then launches a link related app (without navigating to or using the link to display content) and then bounces back to Safari again\n\n*Link opens in an in-app browser in the app where I clicked\n\nExcept for 4, which I gather is something that's source app specific and under control of its settings (e.g. an option to \"use app browser\" or \"open links is Safari\"), I can't figure out how to control which of other three things happen to any given link. Not only that, but the results are not predictable based on the associated application e.g. sometimes clicking on an amazon.com link opens the Amazon app to the expected location (1) sometimes to just opens in Safari (2) and sometimes it bounces around between the two (3).\nHow do I control where links open on iOS?\n\nCurrently iOS 15.1, iPhone 13 Pro, but this has been going on for years.\n\nA: If you don’t have a Guardian app then it will be opened in Safari anyway. So you can delete an app to get links open in Safari or install the app to get links open in the app. It may be not a flexible enough solution, but it is at least controllable to some degree.\nIn Safari you can decide how to open a specific link (in a browser or in an app) by using \"Tab and Hold\" gesture.\n\nOther options will be to use Safari in Private Browsing Mode or lock Safari with Guided Access.\nMore details on ways to stop Safari from opening links in Apps can be found in the article How to Stop Safari From Launching Apps on iPhone and iPad.\nYou can also control the usage of in-app browsers in specific apps.\nFor example in Discord in-app browser is used by default, to control that:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Discord app\n\n*Tap on your Profile\n\n*In App Settings section on select Web Browser menu\n\n*Select between In-App Browser, Safari or Chrome\n\n\nYou can also configure the usage of an in-app browser in these apps:\n\n*\n\n*Gmail\n\n*Telegram\n\n*Twitter\n\n*Facebook\n\nMore details on how to control the in-app browser in these apps can be found in the article How to disable in-app browser on major apps.\nAt the moment I was not able to find a way to get centralized control over this behaviour. So I recommend asking that question in Apple Support or writing a feature request to Apple Feedback This way we can influence this feature to be implemented in the future.\n\nA: An app has been developed that may give you some of the control you desire:\nOpener\nYou can use this action extension to force a link to open in a particular app.\n", "Q: Automatic app relaunch via `launchd` causes flash of second menu bar app icon I'm using a launchd script found here to automatically re-launch an app if the app crashes:\n\nAutomatically relaunch a closed macOS application\n\nThe app has a menu bar icon. After running that script to trigger re-launching if crashed, I'm noticing a second instance of the menu bar icon appears and annoyingly flashes in the menu bar briefly every 20-30 seconds or so.\nIt's as if the script actually launches a new instance of the app, which then quickly terminates if an existing instance of the app is already running. When I really just want it to re-launch if closed.\nWhy is this second application launch occurring?\nAre there any launchd / launchctl arguments that will only re-launch the program if it is no longer running?\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but in my .plist file I was actually referencing a bash script. Within that bash script, I would start a particular program, then execute a few additional commands. The problem was that when loading the .plist file with launchctl, it would run the bash script correctly, the program would be started, however once the bash script terminated, the spawned process of the program would also be terminated. Adding the KeepAlive configuration to the .plist file did not keep the spawned program open, but instead it would just repeatedly execute the bash script (resulting in a situation similar to the \"flashing\" you describe).\nFor me, the solution was to add the following configuration in the .plist file:\n<key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>\n<true/>\n\nThis way, the process spawned by the bash script would be \"abandoned\" by launchd and thus allowed to continue running, even after the bash script exited.\nIf this doesn't solve your problem, then you will have to debug and see what's going on. To debug, add the following configuration:\n   <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n   <string>/tmp/mycommand.err</string>\n   <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n   <string>/tmp/mycommand.out</string>\n\nThen observe the two log files with tail -f .\n", "Q: Suppressing an unwanted new tab in Safari My bank has a new \"improved\" online server.

Is there a way to make Safari discard any links to a particular domain?\n\nA: There are probably more elegant solutions!

I do not own any Apple devices, but a friend recently recommended an Apple TV exclusive show to me which I'd like to watch. My goal is to subscribe using paypal since I don't have a credit card, and to watch shows in my browser or a PC desktop app, if available.\nI have checked the list of available payment methods, and paypal is listed as being available in my country.\nImmediately upon creating a new Apple ID on the Apple TV website, I was asked to enter credit card information, and there was no way to select a different payment option or to proceed without entering it. I then tried creating an Apple ID once more on Apple's main website, which worked, but in the account settings I also wasn't able to select any payment options other than credit card.\nMy friend then pointed me to iTunes, which I installed and logged into. Here, I was able to link up my paypal account and got the message that my Apple ID is now unlocked for use with Apple services. Thinking the problem was solved, I logged in once more into the Apple TV website, which now for the first time let me proceed past the login screen. Obviously, I still can't watch anything while not being subscribed to Apple TV, but when I tried that, I was once again asked to enter my credit card information, to \"confirm that the owner of the account has allowed watching Apple TV through the internet\", or something like that.\nA Google search led me to a support page which made me think I could set up parental controls as an alternative to providing credit card information as a way of enabling the web version of Apple TV. Upon rereading it now, I can see that it doesn't actually say that, which explains why doing this also didn't help and I was asked for credit card information once more.\nWhat am I missing? Is there any way to subscribe to Apple TV using paypal if I don't own an Apple device? Or can I do this on iTunes as well? So far, I was only able to find shows and movies for individual purchase on there, which didn't include the show I was looking for. Apologies if I'm missing something obvious, this feels like a new world to me.\n(Note: I was made aware of an Apple TV app available in the Windows store, however this can only be installed on an Xbox, which I don't own either.)\n\nA: The short answer is no. There is no Apple TV app for Windows, and I think you do need a credit card to subscribe to the service.\nYou might be able to get around the credit card problem if you purchase an iTunes gift card, and add that to your account. Then you will have a positive balance in your account and you might be able to subscribe with that.\nBut you still have the problem about the lack of access to the Apple TV app. This is available in a lot of places, including smart TVs, but not natively in Windows yet, AFAIK.\n\nA: Buying or renting or borrowing an iPod touch or other low cost Apple device will let you get the best payment and account management experience for Apple TV.

I want to have a script that send me a notification (simple email will do) that no more images have been added to a folder after a certain time limit - say 90 seconds.\nCan someone help me with the basic structure?  This machine is locked on OS X Lion for context.\n\nA: In macOS there are several built-in ways to watch a folder and have something automatically done when the contents of the watched folder changes.\n\n*\n\n*The quickest and easiest way may be to use Automator to create a Folder Action workflow. However, in this use case I prefer the next method.\n\n*There is also Folder Actions Setup in which one can attach an AppleScript script to a watched folder and or also manage it and or a Folder Action workflow created by Automator. This is where this answer will focus for creating the Folder Action.\n\n*The least user friendly, without the use of a third-party utility, is manually creating a Launch Agent and using launchctl in Terminal to implement and manage it, and will not be covered herein.\n\nNormally when watching a folder, the assigned action/script is triggered as the contents of the watched folder changes and it does its thing immediately and its done. It does not care if the Folder Action has not been triggered again to then do something else. As such, this presented an interesting look at how to e.g. send an email after e.g. 90 seconds from the time the last scanned document of the current scan batch is added to the watched folder, and essentially do nothing when documents are removed from it.\nTo that end, the solution presented herein has a few different working parts to get it set up. However, once its set up, its on autopilot thereafter...\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript shell script triggered by the AppleScript script attached to the Folder Action.\n\n*Terminal to create the AppleScript shell script executable file.\n\n*TextEdit to edit the AppleScript shell script executable file.\n\n*AppleScript Editor to create the AppleScript script assigned to the Folder Action.\n\n*Folder Actions Setup, a GUI application to configure and manage the Folder Action as needed.\n\n*Mail to handle sending the email.\n\nAppleScript shell script executable file\n\n*\n\n*Create the AppleScript shell script executable file in Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, run the following compound command:\nf='scandone'; touch \"$f\"; open -e \"$f\"; chmod +x \"$f\"\n\n            • Hint: Copy and paste the compound command into Terminal, then press: enter\n\n*\n\n*Then in the opened blank scandone document, in e.g. TextEdit, copy and paste the example AppleScript code, shown further below, into it.\n\n\n*Then make appropriate edits to the value of each property at the top of the script, then save and close the scandone document.\n\n\n*Note that by default the AppleScript shell script is created in the root of one's Home folder. As it will not be needed to run directly from Terminal it does not need to be in a location defined in the PATH passed to the shell. In OS X Lion I created a folder named bin within the root of my Home folder and moved the script there, even though it is not a binary file.\nAppleScript script to attach to the Folder Action\n\n*\n\n*In AppleScript Editor, create a new document adding the example AppleScript code, shown further below after the example AppleScript code used for the AppleScript shell script.\n\n*\n\n*Setting '/path/to/scandone' to the actual POSIX path of the AppleScript shell script executable file created from the directions further above.\n\n\n\n*Save the AppleScript script as, e.g. Watch Scanning.scpt in ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts noting that the ../Scripts/Folder Action Scripts folder does not exist by default. If it does not already exist from previous usage, then just open Terminal and run the following command:\nmkdir -p -m 0700 \"$HOME/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts\"\n\n            • Hint: Copy and paste the command into Terminal, then press: enter\nFolder Actions Setup\n\n*\n\n*Open Folder Actions Setup using one of the methods mentioned in the Notes: section below, starting at: To bring up Folder Actions Setup in OS X Lion\n\n\n*Add the watched folder and AppleScript script using the [+] button on each side of the Folder Actions Setup window. Adding the watched folder from the left side, and the AppleScript script, e.g. Watch Scanning.scpt, from the right side of the window.\n\n\n*On the Folder Actions Setup window, if the [] Enable Folder Action checkbox is unchecked, be sure to check it.\nAssuming Mail is already configured with your email account and working normally, then you are all done and ready to start scanning. (Obviously do some testing first by just adding any old file into the watched folder, as if it was done by the scanner.)\nHow It Works\nWhen a file is added to the watched folder the AppleScript script attached to the watched folder in Folder Actions Setup runs the AppleScript script, which in this case spawns the AppleScript shell script executable file and then quits waiting for the Folder Action to be triggered again.\nThe spawned AppleScript shell script executable file then counts the number of files in the watched folder, waits for the e.g. 90 seconds and then counts the number of files in the watched folder again. Then if the previous count equals the current count the AppleScript shell script sends an email via Mail, the GUI application, not the command line mail, otherwise the shell script just terminates.\nObviously every time the Folder Action is triggered it is going to spawn another occurrence of the AppleScript shell script, however, in my testing I did not see this as an issue. It also was the easiest way I could think of to achieve the goal.\nThe thing to keep in mind is that the total time the shell script waits in-between checking the file count obviously has to be more than the time it takes to scan the document and save it to the watched folder and also includes an appropriate amount of buffer seconds so the timing works.\n\n\nAppleScript shell script executable file\nExample AppleScript code:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\nproperty waitTimeSeconds : 90\nproperty watchedFolder : \"/path/to/WatchedFolder\"\nproperty toName : \"John Doe\"\nproperty toEmail : \"johndoe@domain.com\"\nproperty |Subject| : \"Finished Scanning\"\nproperty |Content| : \"Finished Scanning\"\nproperty quitMail : false\n\n\nset previousFileCount to countFilesInWatchedFolder()\n\ndelay waitTimeSeconds\n\nset currentFileCount to countFilesInWatchedFolder()\n\nif previousFileCount = currentFileCount then\n    \n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        run\n        set theMessage to ¬\n            make new outgoing message with properties ¬\n                {subject:|Subject|, content:|Content|}\n        tell theMessage to ¬\n            make new to recipient at end of ¬\n                to recipients with properties ¬\n                {name:toName, address:toEmail}\n        send theMessage\n    end tell\n    \n    if quitMail then\n        delay waitTimeSeconds\n        quit application \"Mail\"\n    end if\n    \nend if\n\non countFilesInWatchedFolder()\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        return count files of folder watchedFolder\nend countFilesInWatchedFolder\n\n\n\nAppleScript script to attach to the Folder Action\nExample AppleScript code:\non adding folder items to\n    do shell script \"'/path/to/scandone' &>/dev/null &\"\nend adding folder items to\n\non removing folder items from\n    return\nend removing folder items from\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above, was throughly tested in Script Editor (AppleScript Editor in OS X Lion) and as an AppleScript shell script and Mail under macOS Catalina with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nAs the OS X Lion system I tested this on is not connected to a network, I could not actually send the outgoing message in Mail, however the basic instructions work the same as it did in macOS Catalina. Meaning sans actually sending an email in OS X Lion when the contents of the watched folder changed, it did everything else programmed to do.\nTo bring up Folder Actions Setup in OS X Lion, it's not as easy as in testing in macOS Catalina. In macOS Catalina, bring up Spotlight and starting to type Folder Actions Setup makes it available to click to open it. This is not the case in OS X Lion. In OS X Lion I use Terminal and ran the following command:\nopen -a 'Folder Actions Setup'\n\nIn OS X Lion, it is located at: /System/Library/CoreServices/Folder Actions Setup.app\nIn OS X Lion, Folder Actions Setup can also be opened from the Script menu on the menu bar if so configure in AppleScript Editor > Preferences… by checking the [√] Show Script menu in menu bar checkbox, then from the Script menu on the menu bar, Folder Actions  > Configure Folder Actions opens Folder Actions Setup.\nIn OS X Lion, the predecessor to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, in e.g. macOS Catalina, is System Preferences > Universal Access > [] Enable access for assistive devices. In my testing I did not need to have this checked. (YMMV)\nIn the example AppleScript code, if property quitMail : false is set true it will quit Mail after the same value of the value of waitTimeSeconds. Keep in mind that if the email address used for this Folder Action normally has a lot of traffic and Mail was not already opened, you may want to set the value for the delay command in the if quitMail then block manually and greater than the value set for waitTimeSeconds. This is to avoid a race condition between receiving mail and sending mail if the former occurs before the later. You obviously do not want Mail to quit before the message has been sent if a large amount is incoming slows down the outgoing message.\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately..\n", "Q: Low battery warning threshold At the moment, my MacBook (Monterey) seems to only alert low battery at the 15% point. Is there any way to change the trigger threshold to 30%? I am aware of third party apps, but I would just like to know if there are some native settings that is already available for this purpose.\n\nA: I don't think there's any configuration you get to set on the system itself. Asking Apple support would be a way to get an authoritative answer, but something like that people would love and share here I believe.\n\nA: Unfortunately, on standard macOS, Apple did not give you the option to change the trigger for low battery notification.\nHowever, you can use the free app called Battery Monitor, which gives you that option.\n", "Q: Macintosh HD - Data First aid fail - storage problem I recently started to have kernel panic errors and my macbook pro 2019 crashed several times, this started to worry me and the first thing which I noticed was that my storage was pretty full (maybe 20gb available).\nI then hard heartedly deleted several 100GB of data, however noticed that the storage space never expanded.\nI ran the disk utility first aid in the Recovery mode (during restart CMD + R), however didn't manage to solve the problem (below is picture which has been take in normal mode).\nAny advice how to proceed from here or how to fix my hard drive?\n\nEdit: Found this one, but this looks pretty radical to try out, looking for other options:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/406063/438490\n\nA: I would boot to recovery and re-run disk utility as instructed.\nSince you did that and it fails, I back up the drive and test the backup and do an erase install.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/erase-and-reinstall-macos-mh27903/mac\nUnless you wanted to open a support case and have them look at the logs, this is what happens when the utility can't guarantee data integrity.

use the new OS Shortcuts feature to be able to push command-D on my keyboard to automatically extend my display to my iPad over USB instead of having to open System Preferences/Displays and click the

select my iPad. I’d prefer to have this also close the System Preferences window after it issues the command to connect to my iPad as well. I am constantly up and back to my desk throughout the day and my iPad goes with my, but my MacBook stays on my desk, so I have to do this constantly. Small annoyance.\nI tried something along the lines of\nopen \"x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.display\"\n\nI think this may have opened the display preferences (or maybe just the system preferences, sorry, I can’t remember atm), but I don’t know how to proceed from there.\nedit\nApparently this wasn’t clear enough? I’m wanting to just run a script that will start extending my display to my iPad once it’s connected to my iPad via USB. I’ll bind it to a button combination and it will start the extended display feed to the iPad. I’ve seen that shortcuts allows you to insert terminal command scripts as input; hence my above approach. However I'm unfamiliar with the shortcuts app, so if there is an alternative method to accomplishing the same goal, I'm fine with that too. I just don’t want to have to open the System Preferences > Displays > Share to drop down menu every time I hook my iPad back up to my laptop.

I was not able to find this while researching so I hope it serves your success!\nMy solution: Disconnect all cables to the motherboard (flex cables, plug-ins etc). Let it sit for an extended period of time (I left it overnight). Reconnect everything, but the key thing is to CONNECT THE BATTERY LAST. Now try and turn it on. This worked for me twice because I accidentally got it stuck back to the original issue, and found out this solution when I backtracked to find out what fixed the problem.\nMy assumption is that there must be a sitting charge somewhere in the motherboard that causes the power-on issue.

Diagonal lines of affected keys, 5, T, G and -, [ are indicative of circuit board damage [switch permanently open].\nAfter comments re the initial 'spill' being very slight, the later damage may not be related.

I think this should be possible but I'm not knowledgeable to make it work myself.\nI have a MacBook that has a VPN connection and I want to be able to access this VPN connection from another MacBook.\nThe setup looks something like this:\nMacBook 2 -- ethernet --> MacBook 1 <----> Wi-Fi --> Non VPN traffic (default gateway)\n                                                |\n                                                 --> VPN traffic (VPN gateway on ppp0 netif for some IP ranges, eg: 10.35/16 and 10.24/16)\n\nIdeally, I could route all internet traffic from MacBook 2 to MacBook 1 and have MacBook 1 decide where it should go (through VPN gateway or through my normal gateway). So if I accessed 10.35.2.4 from MacBook 2, it would go to MacBook 1, through the VPN and back to MacBook 2. And if I accessed 35.3.3.3 (an IP not in the VPN traffic range) it would simply go to my default gateway and back to MacBook 1.\nHow would I go setting this up?\n\nA: The easy part is sharing internet without VPN. Let’s cover that first. Sign out of VPN and set up network sharing.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-internet-connection-mac-network-users-mchlp1540/mac\nOnce that’s working, you may need to ensure your VPN allows split tunneling and get into very specific configuration details to pull this off but this is a very typical software defined network configuration. Mac 1 is functioning as a router and that router has a point to point VPN tunnel to another router serving the destination network segments you defined.\n", "Q: Why is it that when i try to update something on apple store it doesn't let me This has been happening a lot i'd try to update my VPN or any other app but apple store gives me an ID that isn't mine and I can't click on it to edit and type in the right one so I can't update any of my apps.\nI am the only one using the account I don't share it with anyone and I haven't lent it to anyone\nHere are screenshots of the problem\n\nI try to update it then it asks me to put in login details but the apple ID there isn't mine\n\nso if I put in my password it doesn't work\n\nBecause of that I haven't been able to use any app once it needs an update i have downloaded countless vpn's because once they need an update I am unable to do so and because of that the app stops working\nI thought it was cause of icloud but I logged in and the issue persisted\n\nA: This happens mostly when you get an app purchased from another person installed on your Mac. It could also be a result of a severely broken install.\n\n*\n\n*do you have a back up of your Mac? If so you’re set to do an erase install and before you reinstall anything, sign in to the App Store and test redownloading everything to ensure your store account is clean.\n\nIf not, you could do a smaller test by deleting the app rather than update it. Then redownload it to test.\nIn any case, this might need Apple support since only they can review your purchase history and see why the servers might have your account confused if you don’t think you mixed apps from the other accounts on your system.\nThis mixing of accounts often happens in schools and businesses where they don’t have an MDM to push updates and just used one account to get started. Be sure you check with your support team if this is the case before erasing, but do get a backup of your files in any case.\n", "Q: How do you filter out rows from a table In a table with tens of thousands of records, I need to filter out all records where the first column of each record has \"B\" as value. I've tried activating \"all filters but B\", then select all, copy and paste in new a document, but the new document still includes all B records.\nOne solution could be to add a new numbered \"index\" column, then sorting all records by the first column and select and delete all the B's, and again reordering by the index column...

I'd specifically like to view and edit save files for iOS games I have installed. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can navigate to ~/Library/Containers/ in Finder (note: this Library folder is hidden, so you either have to enable the option to show hidden items, or use Go → Go to folder ...). The subfolder has the name of the app (at least for one I developed years ago and just installed on my Mac):\n\nWhere the save files reside will depend on the application; they could be in Documents, in a Library subfolder or somewhere else.\n", "Q: Converter between MagSafe 1/2 and MagSafe 3 Will there be a converter available for connecting one of the old MagSafe or MagSafe 2 power adaptor to the new MagSafe 3 port which is present in the newly released MacBook Pros?

I doubt we will see anything but “snake oil” in this space, but I could always be wrong.\nMost of this Wikipedia article covers the older technical details which could lead people to expect a simple adapter like was possible between 1 and 2 but the change for 3 is a substantial one and not a “compatible” one.\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe\n", "Q: How to retrieve information about Logic Pro softsynth configuration from LSO file? So I haven't made music in a really long time, but I made sure to save all my LSO song files from Logic so that in the future when I do get back to it I can finish unfinished songs, have old songs, etc.\nThat time has come, and I have Logic Pro X. There is no problem loading the LSOs but the problem comes in that many of the tracks use software synths that are discontinued or don't even work on the latest macOS. Battery 3, Absynth 4, and Kore 2.0 for example (Kore 2.0 being a wrapper like Komplete Kontrol that was discontinued a while ago)\nI bought Komplete 13, and have Battery 4 and Absynth 5... but when I load up the songs obviously it says that cannot find \"Battery 3\", \"Absynth 4\" etc. I contacted Native Instruments about it and they said it's not possible.. but I know that information is stored somewhere..\nIs there any software out there that has deciphered the LSO file, how the information is stored so maybe I can extract what preset was being used, or what sample banks, etc. in Battery 3? I simply refuse to believe there is no way to solve this issue.\nAlso think it's lame that there's no way for you to \"migrate\" to a newer version of the plugin. Of course at time of upgrade you can just record the patch info, knob settings etc. and transfer it to the new plugin, so its only a problem if like me, you come back after that many years.\nLike a fool I threw away my old Komplete disks thinking there's no way that NI would allow an upgrade (which they still do from Komplete 2.. lol)\nbut anyway outside of finding an old Macbook Pro and getting Battery 3 and Absynth 4 and Kore 2 is there a way that I can somehow read the information in the LSO file so I can find out patch info, knob settings, etc.?\n\nA: Let me start by saying I fully sympathise with your predicament, but that your 'simple' request for something to be able to read out the parameter sets is really not as simple as that.\nI'd start by setting up a VM with the last version of macOS that can run those older versions. VMWare Fusion is available free for personal use.\nIf you can save out the settings as patches, then there is a chance the next version can still not only open that patch, but also make sense of it.\nThis isn't guaranteed. Opening doesn't mean they'll sound the same, unfortunately.\nIf you cannot open the patches in newer versions, then even if the VM version limps like a three-legged donkey on a cobbled street, you will at least be able to 'print' the audio stems from each patch/Midi track, then import to your current version.\nI don't have experience with all the specific synths you have listed, but I can parallel this to a similar issue I faced some years ago.\nSome deep background…\nI've been a writer/muso/engineer/producer since the late 70s/early 80s. In the 90s I semi-retired & worked for one of the major multinational musical instrument companies. As such I had contact with all the major software makers of the time - to this day I still have friends at some of them. That, I'm aware, makes me fairly privileged. However…\nIn the mid 2k's I produced & recorded an album for a record company. Ten years later they wanted to do a full remix & remaster of it.\nThe original was done on WinXP, using a version of Cubase & plugins that had long gone out of support.\nWith the assistance of contacts at many of the companies responsible for this huge variety of software, I managed to get the ancient Cubase files & many of the plugins transferred to a modern Mac - using a windows VM initially - & converted to a usable format.\nThat took care of the songs' \"overview\" & all the recorded audio. Some of the plugins, however, not only no longer existed, the companies no longer in business, their authorisation servers were gone, so we couldn't re-authorise.  [One of the developers for one plug actually sent me a cracked version of his own software to bypass this;)) Fortunately, many of these were replaceable reverbs & echos, simple time-modulation fx etc, that I could replace by ear with modern versions by other manufacturers.\nFor many of the plugs I was given authorisation codes that were good for all versions from old to current & access to all those different versions…  but with all the will in the world, we could not get all the plugins to export/import as we went through each subsequent release version.\nSome plugins, even having working copies of every version, we could not get back the original sounds. Not only had the file formats changed [which we were usually able to work through even if some took 4 or 5 major incarnations of the plugs to achieve it], but the internal 'wiring' of the virtual sonic components had changed. Even using known-good conversions, the new plugs sounded different to the old ones.\nI ended up using a combination of newly converted plugs & some 'printed' stems from the original.\nHowever, we ultimately failed to get everything across & had to recreate some of it from scratch. The record company vowed that in future, part of the organisational backup process for a recording would include cling-filming the computer it was recorded on & storing it with the project. [I don't actually know whether they ever implemented this or what became of the strategy.]\nIf you ask nicely, I'm certain the manufacturers of each plug will give you access to older versions - but you still need a working VM to run them, to be prepared for a lot of work, and ultimate disappointment.\n", "Q: I can’t type the number twenty on iOS Since upgrading to iOS 15, I can no longer easily type the number 20. iOS automatically replaces it with 2.0, as shown in the screenshot. I don’t have a Text Replacement that would do this. Is this happening to anyone else, and is there a way to fix it?\n\nAdditional information: this is also happening on my wife’s phone. I used the search function to search for “2.0” on both of our devices, and we both have an app named “RTAGoMobile2.0” installed. I tried removing that app and Reset Keyboard Dictionary, but this behavior has not gone away.\n\nA: This autocorrect is adapting to your patterns of typing.  (that is why nobody else is having exactly the same problem).\nIt's designed to learn words like steerageway or deadfront which you use a lot, and \"correct\" a thing you're unlikely to type for something you're likely to type. I fully expect if I keep saying deadfront long enough, it will \"fix it\" when I say my phone has a dead front camera.\nThis tech needs to be trained and that requires that you dutifully use the on-word edit feature... the \"X\" to not apply autocorrects as they are being suggested, or the \"rollback\" button to undo corrects it has already done.  Those things train the engine and you need to do them.\nAccessing the database is weirdly difficult. It appears the only way to train or delete words is to go into an application which uses this feature, such as TextEdit or a Safari text box, and type the word you are concerned with - so the on-word edit features will come up.  I can see where the files live on Mac ...\n ~/Library/Spelling/dynamic-counts.dat\n ~/Library/Spelling/dynamic-text.dat\n\n... but I have not found a way to manage those databases in a tabular format the way you'd expect to.  I certainly wouldn't expect such a management tool to exist in iOS.\n\nA: iOS adds installed app titles to your autocorrect keyboard dictionary as part of the QuickType keyboard system. A lot of people realized this when MARIO RUN came out on iOS. So the problem was probably originally caused by the RTAGoMobile2.0 app.\nSince removing the app and resetting the keyboard dictionary didn't work, here are two two other things you could try:\n\n*\n\n*You can train the keyboard to unlearn the correction by repeatedly typing \"20\" and tapping the x to remove the \"2.0\" suggestion.\n\n*You can add \"20\" as a text replacement, with \"20\" as both the phrase and the shortcut. Apple documents how to do that here:\n\nWith text replacement, you can use shortcuts to replace longer phrases. When you enter the shortcut in a text field, the phrase automatically replaces it. For example, you could type \"GM\" and \"Good morning\" would automatically replace it.\nTo manage text replacement, tap Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.\n\n*\n\n*To add a text replacement, tap plus icon, then enter your phrase and shortcut. When you've finished, tap Save.\n\n*To remove a text replacement, tap Edit, tap \"-\" then tap Delete. To save your changes, tap Done.\n\n\n\nA: If you type out 20 20 20 20 20 and cancel the suggestion carefully each time, that might reset the learned database on the device that thinks it’s being helpful.\nAlso, I learned after posting this all app names are added to the “auto wrong” database, so you might struggle to “unlearn” those.\nA good way to flush the predictive text on iOS 15 is the Reset Keyboard Dictionary tool in settings -> general\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207767\n\nOnce that is done, try to break the training by not accepting the correction. Also, check other devices you have signed into the same iCloud account in case these hints are shared between devices.\nNone of my devices do that for 10 or 20 or 30, so it’s likely trying to be helpful based on what you typed in the past and not something hard coded. Hopefully, you can dutifully correct the error each time it happens and the adaptive code will unlearn that “correction”. Sometimes auto correct feels more like auto wrong.\nUnless Apple is pushing these “suggestions” from the server, you should be able to wrangle it. If not, a call to apple support might be needed - especially if they are seeding the corrections based on region or usage in general.\n", "Q: What is required for Monterey's Adaptive Sync support? I was excited to try Monterey's adaptive sync, but it doesn't seem to be working with my hardware.\nMy Hardware\nI have an LG 27UD68 display, with a (somewhat limited) Freesync range of 40-60hz. This is an older model that AMD categorizes as \"Freesync\" (not Freesync Premium or Freesync Premium Pro), and it's not on NVidia's \"G-SYNC Compatible\" list.\nMy Windows PC (with an AMD GPU) is able to connect with Freesync.\nI've connected my Mac (2018 MBP, Radeon 560X) to the display two different ways:\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt port -> thunderbolt cable -> thunderbolt dock -> full-size displayport cable -> display\nThe dock is a Caldigit TS3+. I'm not sure whether to expect adaptive sync to make it through the thunderbolt chain.\n\n\n*Thunderbolt port -> adapter cable -> display\nThe cable is a Uni USB-C to DisplayPort Cable. Amazon reviews suggest that it ought to work with freesync.\nSystem Information summarizes the display thus:\nLG Ultra HD:\n  Resolution:   5120 x 2880 (5K/UHD+ - Ultra High Definition Plus)\n  UI Looks like:    2560 x 1440 @ 60.00Hz\n  Framebuffer Depth:    30-Bit Color (ARGB2101010)\n  Main Display: Yes\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Rotation: Supported\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  Yes\n  Connection Type:  Thunderbolt/DisplayPort\n\nWhat I'm seeing is, the available refresh rates include only 30 and 60, no \"Variable\" option:\n\nFor contrast, when the feature is working, it should look something like this:\n\n(image from Ars' Monterey review)\nThe Question\nSo I'm left wondering: under what circumstances is adaptive sync expected to work? Apple's \"Use Adaptive Sync with your Mac\" support page offers no guidance.\nPerhaps there's a specific list of supported displays? Or maybe it requires a range larger than my display's 40-60hz?\nCan anyone chime in with hardware combinations that they've seen work?\n\nA: I found a support page that lists specific hardware!:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any Mac with Apple silicon\n\n*Any of these Intel-based Mac models:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n\n*MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)\n\n*MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2020)\n\n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2020)\n\n*Mac Pro (2019) when used with any of these Radeon Pro MPX modules: W5500X, W5700X, W6800X, W6900X, or W6800X Duo\n\n\n\n\n( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212232 )\nSo the 2018 machine in the question above is not supported.\nAlso I can now report that an M1 Pro offers 40-60hz for the LG 27UD68.\n", "Q: Mac is confused about the display I have macOS 10.15.7 on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019).\nI have an external GIGABYTE M27Q monitor that has been working just fine with resolution 2560x1440 and still works with a linux laptop just fine.\nYesterday I used the MacBook with a different monitor (Dell u3415w) and now the MacBook thinks that the GIGABYTE is DELL, i.e., the Display Preferences identifies it as a DELL and uses 3440x1440 resolution (noticeably wrong aspect ratio).\nThe monitor is connected via HDML-to-USB-C cable.\nDiagnostics:\nApple  Menu ---> About This Mac ---> Displays shows\n\n*\n\n*Built-in Display (3072x1920 --- correct) and\n\n*DELL U3415W Display (3440x1440 --- incorrect)\n\nboth using AMD Radeon Pro 5300M 4 GB graphics.\nWhen the external display is unplugged, Built-in Display uses Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB graphics.\nTried:\n\n*\n\n*Un-plugging and re-plugging the cables and power-cycling the monitor.\n\n*Sleeping and waking up the laptop.\n\n*option + Detect Displays in display settings\n\nworkaround\noption + Resolution: Scaled in the Display Preferences shows more options, including the correct option 2560x1440. Thus now the display shows correct size and aspect ratio, but is named incorrectly.\nHow do I make Mac recognize the display correctly?\n\nA: How to choose screen resolutions within System Preferences\nChoose Apple menu   > System Preferences… > Display > Resolution. Then hold ⌥ [Option Key] while clicking at Scaled. Without holding ⌥ you can just change the size of text and objects on your screen; but clicking Scaled while holding the ⌥ [Option Key] you can switch between screen resolutions.\nFor better understanding see both variants in the screenshots:\n\n\nProper detection of the external display\nSide note: Maybe it could be interesting which display has been recognised by macOS. Just choose Apple menu   > About This Mac > Displays. It should show something like…\nIntegrated Retina-Display\n16-Inch (3072 x 1920)\n…for the internal display.\nHow about the external display? Does macOS recognise the attached Gigabyte M27Q properly?\nAddendum to my previous suggestion in order to fix the primary problem\nAs Display profiles are stored under Color it was not obvious that this might be the profile you just have to delete it.\nI do not know if it works, but it's worth a try:\n\n", "Q: Time Machine without any external disks So, for various security reasons my company doesn't allow attaching backup drives or doing any external backups -- mostly we have cloud things and use git for backup. But Time Machine lets me use the SSD and local storage for backups.\n\nSo I'd like to use Time Machine to just let me revert to recent things (like a file I accidentally delete or similar). Is there any way to configure that?\n\nA: I really haven’t tried to “hoodwink” the system since I just attach an external disk. If you don’t want it connected - the system runs well and reminds you every 2 weeks or so to connect the external drive.\nYou can make use of the GUI and local snapshots features once you get one backup to an external drive, even when it’s not connected.\nIf you really must have snapshots without the Time Machine setup automating all the steps and triggering the automatic snaps, you would have to create and manage the snapshots with another tool or command line snapshots.\nApple only documents this as a function call fs_snapshot_create which has a very excellent manual page\nman fs_snapshot_create\n\nOnce you’ve created snapshots, you can list and delete them easily with the diskutil command line tool. Disk Utility can also show you snapshots so you can visualize, mount and delete them.\n\n\nA: The bad news is that even the local snapshots seem to need Time Machine to be configured with an external disk, which sounds silly to me.\nOne option would be to use a disk image as a cheat, but the TM preferences won't allow you to select such a disk.\nThe good news is that we can use the CLI to make TM accept the disk image, which you can then trash and forget. So we end up with the automatic local backups that we wanted.\nThe procedure:\n\n*\n\n*Create a read/write, sparsebundle disk image with Disk Util. I suggest naming it \"FakeDisk\" or similar so that you (and your IT people!) remember that this is not a real external disk.\n\n*Mount the disk image.\n\n*This is the key point: you need to use the CLI to make TM accept the disk image as a destination: sudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/FakeDisk\n\n*You can now unmount and trash the disk image.\n\n*Go to your TM preferences and click the checkbox. Done!\n\nTM will probably remind you every ~10 days that you didn't do a backup to the configured disk. Unfortunately I don't see a way to avoid those notifications, but a click every few days is OK with me.\nThe TM menu item will show forever \"Waiting to complete first backup\", but you can confirm that the local snapshots are working by entering TM itself, or in DiskUtil (as shown in @bmike's answer).\n", "Q: How can I programmatically test if the ISRG Root X1 certificate is present and trusted in Keychain Access? On September 30, 2021, the DST Root CA X3 expired, and left macOS 10.11 and older unable to connect to any HTTPS servers which use Let's Encrypt by default. One easy way to fix this is to manually add the newer ISRG Root X1 certificate to Keychain Access and mark it as trusted.\nIs it possible for a shell script to test for the presence and trust status of this certificate? If the certificate isn't present, I'd like to warn the user and direct them to possible solutions, such as the one above.\nI want a solution which can work offline. Attempting to e.g. connect to a test website with curl seems unreliable, as the website could go down or there could be some other network misconfiguration.\nHow can I go about this?\n\nA: Thank you (again) to @1110101001 for the key hint I needed!\nsecurity find-certificate -c 'ISRG Root X1' will return an negative exit status if no certificate with that name exists in a Keychain. So:\nif ! security find-certificate -c 'ISRG Root X1'\nthen\n    # The certificate isn't installed.\nfi\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't actually check if the certificate is trusted; we're assuming that if it exists, it's probably trusted as well. Until I can figure out how to check trust status, this will do for now.\nYou can even install the certificate for the user... this kind of feels like it shouldn't be allowed, but hey, that's not our problem and we're using it for a good cause?\n\nif ! security find-certificate -c 'ISRG Root X1'\nthen\n    if [ $(shasum -a 256 ./isrgrootx1.der | cut -d ' ' -f1) == \"96bcec06264976f37460779acf28c5a7cfe8a3c0aae11a8ffcee05c0bddf08c6\" ]\n    then\n        sudo security -v add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ./isrgrootx1.der\n    fi\nfi\n\nThe checksum step is a security precaution, to avoid installing a (potentially maliciously) modified copy of the certificate. It is by no means foolproof, but it's probably a good idea.\nPlease do also add a message to give the user some idea of what's going on.\n", "Q: How to activate Fitness and Fitness+ on Watch 6 and iPhone 11?

Which is weird since it explicitly says on the DNS screen that while it's Private Relax is on, you can't manually set DNS settings.\nBecause of that I'm still not clear on exactly why this happened but hope that helps someone. And I'm curious if anyone has theories on what it was?\n\nA: It seems you may just be lacking a working DNS configuration.\nIf iCloud Private Relay is on, your DNS queries from Safari should go through the relay, not go straight to your ISP.   IF they go to your ISP via the relay, the ISP's DNS servers are not likely to respond.  Why?  Typically, it's advised when setting one up to serve a network's own users, to NOT allow a DNS server to act as a public DNS server.  So since it's likely your ISP isn't running a public DNS server, it won't respond to queries that appear to come from outside its network.  (The few companies that do run public DNS servers generally don't use those same servers to host the DNS records of their own domains.)\nHowever, if retesting confirms that \"Turning off iCloud Private Relay on both devices did not fix the issue.\" then there's another problem as well.  (Could be the problem I identified plus bad caching.)\n", "Q: transfer pdfs in ibooks to PC On my iPad, I graded student assignments by marking opening emails in a browser, opening pdf attachments in iBooks, and editing those pdfs with a stylus.

I am currently at Big Sur 11.5.1\n\nA: grep is not broken per-se in macOS Big Sur.\nThe output you are seeing is stderr output from the ducommand and it is a separate stream from stdout that is being being piped to grep.\nUse du -h -d 1 2>/dev/null instead, or use du -h -d 1 2>&1 | grep -v 'not permitted', however, I'd use the former instead in this particular use case.\nHave a look at Standard streams as a reference on standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).\n", "Q: Changing text via a Services-based Perl shell scripts in Shortcuts on macOS 12 Monterey I have a handful of Automator actions that I'm trying to port to Shortcuts. One of them works like this:\n\n*\n\n*I select some text in an app.\n\n*I right-click the selected text and select Services → Prefix With Arrows.\n\n*The text now has >  on the left edge of every line (I use this to quickly blockquote Markdown text).\n\nAll this is handled, at its core, with a short Perl script:\nwhile (<>) {\n    $_ =~ s/^(.*)$/\\> \\1/m;\n    print;\n}\n\nIn Automator, it all looks like this:\n\nHowever, I've been trying to port this action to Shortcuts on Monterey, and I'm not having much success. I've made a new Shortcut, called Stick Arrows In Front, that attempts to replicate the functionality without success. The Perl code is exactly the same. Here's what the rest of it looks like:\n\nHowever, when I run my Shortcut while having text selected, the text doesn't change at all.\nAm I doing anything wrong, and/or should I file a Radar?\n\nA: I figured something similar out. The missing piece seemed to be adding a Stop and output action to the end. The wrinkle: this only works after a JXA action (Run JavaScript for Automation), not a Run Shell Script action.\n\nThe code:\nfunction run(input, parameters) {\n    const text = input[0][0];\n    const lines = text.split('\\n');\n    const prefixedLines = lines.map(l => `> ${l}\\n`);\n    return ''.concat(...prefixedLines);\n}\n\nThis Shortcut doesn't keep the text selected after it's done running (unlike the Automator action), but that's not a dealbreaker for me.\nAdditionally, one can just modify input[0][0] and return the entire input variable, but this works just as well for my purposes.\n\nA: I tried your first example using the Notes app, and it did not work until I told it to “Create note with” which worked but you end up with a new note. If you tell it “Show Compose Sheet” you can have it append to the existing note, but you essentially get your text duplicated, the original, and the modified. I’m not sure if that would be helpful, but at least your perl code still works as it did before. And I could only get it to work in the Note app.\n", "Q: Receiving multiple files, not just one, in a Shortcut on macOS 12 Monterey I'm porting an Automator action to Shortcuts and I'm having a bit of trouble. Here's my Automator action:\n\nThe snippet of zsh inside is:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /usr/local/bin/oxipng -pD -o max \"$f\"\ndone\n\nThis Automator action lets me select a bunch of PNG files in Finder, right-click on them, choose Services → oxipng -pD -o max, and after a while, the files will be smaller thanks to oxipng.\nHowever, when I try to port it to Shortcuts, I'm a bit stuck. Here's what I have so far, in a Shortcut with a less nerdy name, an adjusted path to oxipng, and some debugging printfs:\n\nAs an aside, the Shortcut Input to the Run Shell Script action is Type: File, Get: File Path. By default, names passed in don't have the full file path or file extensions.\nWhen I run the Shortcut with only one image selected, everything runs just as it used to. However, if I select a bunch of files, I'm prompted to choose only one of them. The prompt looks like this:\n\nHow can I get my Shortcut to process all the files that I've passed to it?\n\nA: Ran into the same issue while trying to port some Automator scripts to Shortcuts. So frustrating. I really hope there's a better approach than the workaround I came up with.\nHere's what ended up working for me:\n1. Start with the \"Combine Text\" action\n\n2. Right click on \"Text List,\" hover over \"Select Variable\" and choose \"Shortcut Input\"\n\n3. Left click on \"Shortcut Input\" and select \"File Path\". Make sure \"With New Lines\" is selected\nThis will combine the input file paths with newlines.\n\n4. Convert the newline-separated filename input into an array and iterate over it.\nI tried a few other ways of combining / replacing the file paths prior to the shell script (e.g. sending them in as quoted strings separated by a space -- \"file 1\" \"file 2\") to see if I could make \"$@\" work as it normally does, but I gave up after a while. No matter what I did \"$1\" looked just like \"$@\". So I ended up with something custom.\n\nShell script\nHere's the shell script for easy copy/paste (should work on bash and zsh by just modifying the index of FILES in the dirname command for bash as noted in the comments):\n# Expects a file path or newline-separated list of file paths\n\n# Change Internal Field Separator (IFS) to newline,\n# convert the input file paths(s) into an array (uses IFS),\n# then revert IFS\nOLDIFS=\"$IFS\"\nIFS=$'\\n'\nFILES=($(echo $@))\nIFS=\"$OLDIFS\"\n\n# If needed, e.g. to created a new sub-directory for output, \n# cd to the files' directory using the first item in the array\n# (change index to 0 if bash -- zsh arrays start at 1)\ncd \"$(dirname \"${FILES[1]}\")\"\n# mkdir -p ./output # Example: create a directory for output\n\n# Iterate over the files in the array\nfor FILE in \"${FILES[@]}\"; do\n  # Do stuff with $FILE here\ndone\n\n\nAll together\nMake sure in the Shell Script to choose \"Input: Combined Text\" and \"Pass Input: as arguments\"\n\n\nA: To avoid processing a list of file paths in your shell script just loop over the input with Repeat with Each and pass each file path as the script argument with a Shortcuts variable.

Actually, the -c switch supports only one command per invocation. It does not support multiple commands in one shot (i. e. invoking PlistBuddy with a single -c containing multiple commands separated by coma or semicolon like in the invented example below):\n# Invented command, don't try it, it doesn't work!\n\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Entry1, Print :Entry2, Print :…'      # Multiple commands separated by comma doesn't work\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Entry1; Print :Entry2; Print :…'      # Multiple commands separated by semikolon doesn't work either\n\nIn fact, every command (i. e. Print, Set, Add, Delete and so on) has to be invoked with its dedicated -c switch:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Entry1' -c 'Print :Entry2' -c 'Print :…'      # Propper invocation to get the values for Entry{1,2,…}\n\nA real example for Bookmarks.plist looks like this:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:1:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:2:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:3:URLString' Bookmarks.plist\n\nGetting numerous entries from plist file this way would require invoking dozens or even hundreds of -c statements. Tedious!\nAspired solution: doing it programmatically using printf, brace expansion and xargs\nMy approach is to achieve this programmatically by combining printf, brace expansion {1..n} (ranges) and xargs.\nThe following line should do the whole magic. echo, i. e. invoke a dry-run, is used to check the proper syntax first:\nprintf -- \"-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:%d:URLString' \" {1..50} | xargs -0I{} echo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy {} Bookmarks.plist\n\nPerfect, the result is as expected:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:1:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:2:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:3:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:4:URLString' Bookmarks.plist\n\nLet us examine the details for a better understanding\nprintf needs -- as first option in order to handle the leading hyphen from -c properly.\nThe range in braces {1..50} will be interpolated to 1, 2, 3, […], 50\nThe printf statement...\nprintf -- \"-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:%d:URLString' \" {1..50}\n\n...will give us the following (interpolated) result:\n-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:1:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:2:URLString' […] -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:50:URLString' \n\nA closer look at the xargs part:\nxargs -0I{} echo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy {} Bookmarks.plist\n\nInvoking xargs without any arguments takes a list from STDIN (one argument per line) and passes it (in groups) to another command. The main focus is that all values are appended (can be thought as appending a tail) at the end of command.\nAccording to this thread:\n\n-I option changes the way the new command lines are built.\nInstead of adding as many arguments as possible at a time, xargs\nwill take one name at a time from its input, look for the given token\n({} here) and replace that with the name.\nThe -0 option in your example instructs xargs to split its input on null bytes instead of blanks or newlines.\n\nThis is exactly what is needed; a kind of insertion between PlistBuddy and File and a proper handling of white spaces:\nPlistBuddy {INSERTED COMMANDS} File\n\nINSERTED COMMANDS is the place where all -c switches should be \"inserted\" by xargs.\nProblem:\nInvoking this command without the echo throws the following error:\nFile Doesn't Exist, Will Create:  \n-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:1:URLString' -c 'Print Children:1:Children:2:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:3:URLString' -c 'Print :Children:1:Children:4:URLString'<br />\nCommand:\n\nBut invoking the result with copy and paste or piping it to a file and executing it as shell script...\nprintf -- \"-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:%d:URLString' \" {1..4} | xargs -0I{} echo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy {}Bookmarks.plist > testing.sh && source ./testing.sh\n\n... gives a list of bookmarks without any issues:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com\nhttps://www.stackoverflow.com\nhttps://www.google.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com\n\nAn even better workaround is to pipe the whole result to a shell:\nprintf -- \"-c 'Print :Children:1:Children:%d:URLString' \" {1..4} | xargs -0I{} echo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy {}Bookmarks.plist | sh -\n\nYes, its a smart workaround, but it's still a workaround.\nQuestion\nWhat is missing or how must the command look like to be properly executed within the shell (without the workaround of copy and paste or redirection into a second shell via pipe)?\n\nA: I may be misreading the question, but if your goal is to pull out some plist(5) data, have you considered going the xpath(1) way?

It seems like a reasonable thing to try would be to delete the iCloud keychain on my Mac and then restore it from iCloud, but I'm not sure whether this is safe or would preserve all of my keychain entries.\nWhat is the correct procedure for restoring iCloud Keychain on a Mac?\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Apple ID.\n\nUntick the Keychain box and follow any on-screen instructions. Give the computer a couple of minutes, then restart. The iCloud keychain is now deleted. Go back to System Preferences > Apple ID, and re-tick the keychain box. Follow all on-screen instructions, wait a couple of minutes to sync, and your iCloud keychain will be fixed. If you had any entries not synced due to issues syncing, these will be lost.

For security and portability\nreasons, do shell script ignores the configuration files that an\ninteractive shell would read, so you don’t get the customizations you\nwould have in Terminal. Use the full path to the command, for example,\n/sbin/ifconfig instead of just ifconfig.

As mentioned in Issuing Commands, do shell script does not read\nthe configuration files that an interactive shell running in Terminal\nwould.\nAny application launched from the Finder gets the same default\nenvironment: a working directory of / and the environment variables\nHOME, LANG, PATH, SHELL, and USER. Most applications do not change\ntheir environment, but relying on this is a maintenance risk.\n\n\nA: Unless you've done something highly creative, Script Editor is using sh to run shell scripts.  It does not use your configured shell.\nThat points to a copy of bash by default.\nWhen bash is invoked (as a login shell) as sh, it only reads /etc/profile and ~/.profile.  But it reads no startup files otherwise.  So it is not reading any shell configuration you think you are providing.\nSo you should be just inheriting from the system.\n\nNote that pbpaste is findable since it's in /usr/bin and the default path includes /usr/bin.\nSince that doesn't work, something else has been changed.\n", "Q: Numbers can’t be installed on “macos” because macOS version 11 or later is required I have used Apple Numbers in the past, have deleted it because of a tiny 128GB ssd.

Why can't they offer a version for macOS 10 for download? Is this a way to force users to install 11?\nHow can I install Numbers for macOS 10?\n\nA: Open the App Store application. If necessary, sign in. Press the key combination ⌘0 or select Store→View My Account..... If you previously downloaded Numbers, then you should be able to download the older version from the webpage.\nI have Catalina installed on a 2013 iMac. Below is an example for the Pages application. I can not show an example for the Numbers application, because I already have Numbers installed.\n\nIf you never downloaded Numbers previously, then you may wish to try one of the alternatives given below.\n\n*\n\n*Find someone you has purchased Numbers. Use their account to download Numbers to your Mac.\n\n*Find another Mac with a version of Numbers compatible with your Mac and migrate to your Mac.\n\n*Find a machine running Big Sur or newer, which does not have Numbers installed. Use your account to install Numbers on that machine, then go back to your Mac and install Numbers. See my other answer for an example.\n\n\nA: If the Numbers application is not shown as a previous purchase under your Apple ID, then you may be able to use following steps to download and install. Since you have a small internal SSD, you would probably need the additional space provided by an external drive for the temporary virtual machine.\n\nBasically, the temporary virtual machine is needed to put the Numbers application in the list of purchases under your Apple ID. Once in the list, an older version of the application can be downloaded on the real Mac. (Actually, since the Numbers application is already install on my Mac, I tested using the Pages application instead.)\n\nI have a 2013 iMac. The latest version of macOS that Apple officially supports for my Mac is Catalina. I have Catalina installed on a external 500 GB USB SSD. I created a new Apple ID for the purpose of determining a way to download the Numbers application using an Apple ID with no previous purchases.\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the VMware Player application. This is a free product provided the use is for Non-Commercial activity.\n\n*Download the \"Install macOS Catalina\" application from the App Store.\n\n*Create a Catalina virtual machine. Afterwards, you can delete the \"Install macOS Catalina\" application.\n\n*Upgrade the virtual machine to Monterey.\n\n*Use the virtual machine and your Apple ID to install the current version of the Numbers application from the App Store into Monterey. Afterwards, you can delete the virtual machine.\n\n*Use your Apple ID to install the older version of the Numbers application from the App Store into Catalina. See my other answer for the procedure.\n\nNote: You probably will incur a delay before an application purchased appears in your account when viewed on a machine which is different from the machine where the purchase was made.

The closest alternative is to simply launch the Terminal app. You can also launch Spotlight with Command + Space to access a lot of simple search features. You can read about the basics on apple's website. I also might recommend some third-party spotlight replacement apps such as Alfred or quicksilver. You can use these apps to run commands in the terminal directly from Command + Space.\nIf you want to know some basic Terminal commands to replace what you are used to on Windows, I recommend the open command. You can use it to open a URL, a file, a folder, etc. For example, open a folder with open /path/to/folder. Open a file with open file.txt (you can also add -a SomeApplicationHere to open a file in a different app). Lastly, use ./your-script-here to execute some script in the directory you are in.\n", "Q: Apple Mail always \"Expand All Conversations\" In Apple Mail I can set View -> \"Expand All Conversations\" but if I quit Apple Mail and open it again the setting is lost and I have to set it again. Is there any way to keep the setting \"Expand All Conversations\" always active?\n\n\nA: I believe the intention of that menu option is that it's a command, not a setting— hence why there's also a \"collapse\" option.\nClicking \"expand all conversations\" is the equivalent of clicking the ⧁ on all messages in the current mailbox. Which conversations are expanded seems to only persist for as long as that mailbox is open— switch to a different mailbox and they're all collapsed again.\n(At least in Monterey)\n", "Q: Cant write to network shared disk in macOS Big Sur (only sudo) I mounted network nfs shared folder in terminal with mount -v -o vers=4 -t nfs IP_ADDRESS:/ /Users/USERNAME/shared, I see network location in Finder with right content of shared folder, But i cant write to it (copy/move my files).\nI can read anything but write work only in terminal in sudo mode.\nI think it is some permission problem, but i cant figure out how to fix it.\n\nA: After hours of investigating I found working solutions, I had to change a server export setings to\nno_subtree_check,no_auth_nlm,insecure,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,all_squash,rw\n\nAlso I had to change mount options in mac terminal\nmount -v -w -o vers=4,noowners,rw,nolocks,locallocks -t nfs IP_ADDRESS:/ /Users/USERNAME/shared\n\nNow it looks like everything works well.\n", "Q: Using sed steam editor to replace a specific string of regular and special characters Using the command line utility sed stream editor, how can I replace the following string of regular and special characters &#39; with a single quote '\nFor example, I want to replace &#39; with a single quote ' from the below sentences:\nFROM:\nNicholas Latifi: \\&#39;We didn\\&#39;t get through all the laps we wanted to\\&#39; in Mexico City Friday practice\nDespite \\&#39;strong race pace\\&#39; in FP1, gearbox issues hampered George Russell\\&#39;s Mexican GP Friday practice\n\nTO:\nNicholas Latifi: 'We didn't get through all the laps we wanted to' in Mexico City Friday practice\nDespite 'strong race pace' in FP1, gearbox issues hampered George Russell's Mexican GP Friday practice\n\n\nA: It seems that you also want to strip away the semicolon, too: Hence:\nsed -e \"s/&#39;/'/g\" file > file.new\n\nor without output redirection, modifying in-place:\nsed -ie \"s/&#39;/'/g\" file\n\nThe 'g' modifier signals that a global substitution (i.e. all occurrences in each line) is desired.\nIf you have a string to filter this will look like:\necho \"hello&#39;world\"|sed -e \"s/&#39;/'/g\"\nhello'world\n\n", "Q: Monterey: SSH with hardware key only works once I'm having an issue using my hardware security key with SSH on Monterey.

Make sure that you have \"Ukrainian PC\" checked (and not \"automatic\" or Ukrainian).\n", "Q: New Family Sharing account does not create shared Photos/Reminders/Calendar The official landing page for the Family Sharing feature states the following:\nhttps://www.apple.com/family-sharing/\n\nWhen you set up your family, a shared album is created automatically in the Photos app on all family members’ devices. Everyone can add photos, videos, and comments to the album whenever they like and get notified when something new is added. Family Sharing also sets up a family calendar where everyone can view, add, or change events and appointments, and get an alert when something changes. And anyone can use the Reminders app to send time or location reminders to the family. So when it’s picture day, pizza night, or just a trip to the beach, everyone’s in the know.\n\nMy household is new to the Apple ecosystem and did not set up the Family Sharing feature on our devices until after iOS 15 was released. After Family Sharing was set up between both Apple IDs, I found that the apps mentioned in the marketing text above did not create the shared objects in these apps automatically. There is no shared photo gallery for the family, no shared calendar, and no shared reminders list. It is still possible to create these objects manually and share them the old fashioned way, but the feature is not working as advertised above.\nIt looks like either 1) the shared objects are not being generated, or 2) none of the devices are able to see them due to a bug. A few internet searches show others reporting a similar problem, but none ever reported a solution. None of these were terribly recent.\n\n*\n\n*2017: No family shared folder\n\n*2018: Photos - shared family album missing\nDevices used to set up family sharing\n\n*\n\n*Family member 1 (Organizer)\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 15.1\n\n*iPad Air 4th Generation, iPadOS 15.0.2\n\n\n\n*Family member 2 (Adult)\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 13, iOS 15.1\n\n\n\nAttempted troubleshooting\n\n*\n\n*Powered off all devices and powered them back on again.\n\n*Verified that all devices were signed in to the correct Apple ID accounts, and that other family members were visible under Settings -> Apple ID -> Family Sharing.\n\n*Verified that Location Sharing for family members was able to be set up between these three devices and worked without any issues.\n\n*Removed family member #2, removed family member #1 (effectively disbanding the family), and restarted Family Sharing from scratch. Re-invited family member 2, set up Location Sharing again, verified that the feature was still working in the Find My app. Still no change within the Calendar, Photos, and Reminders apps.\n\n\nA: After performing the troubleshooting steps above, I scheduled a call with Apple support and walked the technician through the problem and the steps that were taken.\n\n*\n\n*I was asked to perform the additional step of enabling Purchase Sharing. Neither of us expected this to work, and it did not.\n\n*I was then asked to provide a link to the documentation where the expected functionality was described, and he was surprised to see that I was quoting from https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/ and not an outdated knowledgebase article.\n\n*The technician asked for some time to consult with a peer and review internal documentation. He was able to find an internal document stating that this was expected behavior, but was otherwise vague on details. He explained that he has come across this sort of verbiage before, and that it is often a step toward functionality being deprecated within Apple software.\n\n*He informed me that all he could do is provide some internal feedback about the missing feature still being described within the marketing materials. It was very unlikely anyone would be getting back to him personally in response, and that we were effectively at a dead end on troubleshooting the issue.\n\nIt's odd that I don't see more postings about this situation when trying to research the problem via search engines. I see two possibilities at this point:\n\n*\n\n*The technician is correct and this feature has recently been deprecated. It's weird that more people aren't complaining about it, but apparently I'm one of the few people who decided to wait until late 2021 to set up Family Sharing on an iPhone.\n\n*My Apple ID has somehow bugged out, and the technician found a vaguely worded internal bulletin that caused him to give up on troubleshooting too quickly.\n\nI'm leaving this Q&A open for two weeks in the off chance that the support rep was wrong and another user is able to identify a solution. Worst case scenario, I'll accept this as the answer and the Q&A will save future users from spending unnecessary time on this problem in the future.

I use one iCloud account for my private use (mainly on my phone) and one for work (on my Macbook Pro with Monterey). I however want to use Reminders to use both accounts, so I could see all my working reminders on my private phone and all my private reminders on my working computer. I've already done the same for Calendar but for reminders it seems different. On my Internet Accounts settings page there is no Reminders.\n\nAm I missing something? Is there a way I can use 2 iCloud accounts in the Reminders?\n\nA: As far as I can tell this is not supported. There is not documentation from Apple stating one way or another, but the fact that the Reminders app itself does not provide an accounts section while other Apple provided apps, such as Calendar, Mail, etc. all do makes me believe Reminders just was not designed for this.\n", "Q: How To Turn Off Keyboard Backlight on MacBook Pro 2021? The 2021 14/16 inch MBP's don't have the Touch Bar nor the function keys dedicated to adjusting keyboard light. Has anyone figured out how to manually turn it off completely if I find it distracting?\n\nA: You can do it from the Control Centre — the new icon in the menu bar that looks like two sliders. When you click on that, it shows a dropdown with several panes:\n\nOne of the small panes says ‘Keyboard Brightness’: click on that, and it shows a slider that you can drag from full brightness all the way down to none:\n\nNote that in System Preferences, the ‘Keyboard’ tab of the ‘Keyboard’ pane has a few options related to the keyboard backlight that you might want to check: in particular, the backlight can be turned off after anything from 5 seconds to 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\nA: In case the icon is missing, you can add it from the Control Centre pane in the System Settings.

I want to know when my system is thermal throttling.\n\nA: The powermetrics command that comes with macOS does not have a text interface as the one screenshotted with charts, etc. It does however collect information and write them out in a standard format that makes it easy to create a small program that parses it and displays it in charts, etc.\nAs an example of such a program, you can take a look at this open source project:\nhttps://github.com/singhkays/apple-m1-power-consumption-powermetrics\nIt takes the data collected by powermetrics, parses it and generates nice looking charts for use on for example a blog or web site.\nAnother example is asitop:\nhttps://github.com/tlkh/asitop\nAs seen in the screenshot here from an extensive M1 benchmark:\n\n\nA: The tool is asitop https://github.com/tlkh/asitop\nIt took a while to find it - but managed to find it from one of the Max Tech presenters (source: https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev/status/1455577577691570177?s=20 )\nM\n", "Q: Installing iOS/ iPad applications in macOS m1 I'm not sure what the rule is around installing apps for other Apple platforms (like iPhone / iPad) on macOS. Specifically, I would like to install the Lumi app shown here: https://apps.apple.com/app/lumi-music/id1481450834#?platform=ipad\nI fully understand it may not be compatible, but then I do not understand how other iOS apps are allowed to run in some cases. For example, Spotify is another application which is not available from the store. The application is downloaded directly from their website instead and then installed as an iOS application.\n\nSo specifically then my questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Is there an official channel to consume iOS / ipad apps that have not yet been given the Universal / Apple Silicon treatment?\n\n\n*If there is no official Apple vetted method, is there an appropriate 3rd party method? Perhaps iMazing as an emulator?\nThanks in advance, and apologies if the question seems basic. I've spent around an hour reading various forums before deciding to ask for help.\n\nA: This can be a little tricky and MacRumors verified what I thought I had heard:\n\nApp developers can choose not to make their ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ apps\navailable on ‌M1‌ Macs through the ‌Mac App Store‌\n\nI'm pretty sure the Netflix app is this way, there are other examples.\nAlso some apps will just say \"not verified for MacOS.\" Which I believe means use at your own risk. Meaning it might just not work real well.\nFailing the official way of getting an iOS app on your M1 Mac you can use one of the 3rd party iOS backup apps (I use iMazing, there are others) that does back up the apps on your phone (like iTunes used to do, but does no longer) and allows you to then extract the iOS apps from the backup and try running them on your Mac.\nThis does not guarantee that the apps installed on a Mac this way will actually work or even launch but iMazing has a free trial period, so you can try it out and see if it does what you need with the apps that you want.\n", "Q: Airpods 3 using AAC-ELD on macOS? The promo for Airpods 3 claim to use the AAC-ELD codec for better two-way audio quality with FaceTime. Before I purchase Airpods 3, I'd like to be sure this claim is actually true:\nDo Airpods 3 use AAC-ELD on macOS with FaceTime and other audio chat applications?\nThanks for shedding some light on the matter!\n\nSomeone who already owns Airpods 3 could figure it out roughly as follows:\nOn macOS, when the Airpods are connected and sending/receiving, you can see the currently used codec by holding the alt-key and clicking on the Bluetooth menu bar item.\nSo after pairing the Airpods 3 e.g. with a MacBook, in the audio preferences, set both input and output to use the Airpods. Then open some audio chat app such as Slack, start a conversation and check which codec is in use. (If it sounds like an 80s landline connection, you should most likely see SCO as codec in use.)\n\nA: The ALT+Bluetooth menu was removed in MacOS Monterey, which is also the first version to support AirPods 3, so there is now way to check it anymore. Even their Bluetooth Explorer Developer Tool either does not work anymore or does not tell you that specific detail.\nHowever, the Console app (not the Terminal) does log what codec is negotiated. And there you see, even my AirPods Pro's now use AAC-ELD at 24000 Hz.\n\nThe sample rate of 24000 Hz is still not what I would call \"HD\", but better than the 16000 Hz of the previous mSBC profile. If you want to know more, then I recommend ValdikSS excellent article about bluetooth audio.\n\nA: Nemo64 I just wanted to add a bit of context to your answer, but I'm am not allowed to comment yet.\n\nThe sample rate of 24000 Hz is still not what I would call \"HD\"\n\nAAC-ELD uses Spectral Band Replication (SBR) similar to HE-AAC. HE-AAC encodes one main audio stream and a secondary SBR stream. The main stream is encoded using plain AAC at a reduced sample rate. Typically half. An additional SBR stream encodes the remaining bandwidth by differencing with the main audio stream (à la MP3's Joint Stereo). When you see a HE-AAC or AAC-ELD stream reporting 24000Hz, the codec is reporting the sample rate of the base stream. SBR is a second decode pass that is able to \"unfold\" the higher frequency portion of the audio. This is also backwards-compatible, since a normal AAC decoder will only \"see\" the main stream and play it at half bandwidth. A compliant HE-AAC or AAC-ELD decoder will be able to decode the full bandwidth.\ntl;dr AAC-ELD reports half of the bandwidth encoded. 24000hz here actually means 48000Hz.\n", "Q: Changed user account name and now notes gone missing I changed the name of my user account which then made a new folder on my computer for this account and I lost important notes which I now can’t or don’t know how to access.

Can there be any ill effects to an iPhone 13 Pro Max as a result of using a Lightning magnetic cable like this one below to charge it (because of it being magnetic)?\nThanks\n\n\nA: If the cable is USB and Lightning standards compliant, there should not be a problem. You haven't included a vendor name, product name, or similar, so it's hard to say something specific about this cable - but it looks like it might be a cheap \"China knockoff\" and perhaps the vendor does not specify that it is compliant with those standards.\nIf you're asking in general whether having a small, relatively low-strength magnet located approx 1 cm away from the iPhone's charging port will cause problems - then no, that's very improbable.\nThere could be any number of other problems with the cable if it is not standards compliants (bad connections, improper shielding, low quality materials, etc) - but the simple fact that it includes a magnet does not itself constitute a major problem.\n", "Q: Charge 2017 13\" Macbook air through Thunderbolt 2 port, while connecting display I currently have a 2017, 13\" Macbook Air, and have been looking to buy a monitor to have at home. Is there a product that would allow me to power my computer, while connecting an external monitor (preferably HDMI), through the Thunderbolt 2 port?\n\nA: No, unfortunately not. As stated in the comment, TB2 does not support power delivery.\nIf you were to find an old Apple 27\" Thunderbolt Display it comes with a cable that has both a TB2 connector and a Magsafe 2 connector, which can both deliver display signal from the laptop to the monitor AND power from the monitor to the laptop.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display\nI don't think there's a 3:rd party monitor that has that available unfortunately.\n", "Q: Coherence mode in a remote desktop app Parallels Desktop had a great feature \"Coherence mode\" that displays windows, of the VM, in the macOS UI as if they're part of macOS making the experience much better.\nI have a powerful Windows (Pro, non-server) machine to which I connect from macOS using Microsoft's Remote Desktop app. This Windows PC is, due to it's i9 CPU and 32GB memory, a better choice than using a (Parallels) VM.\nWhat I'm looking for is a remote desktop app that mimics the Coherence mode of Parallels Desktop.\nThe protocol it uses isn't important for me (RDP, VNC, etc) as long as it works.\nIs something like this available? I couldn't find that (yet).\nNB: Free or paid doesn't matter, although when paid I'm not want to pay more than $100 per year.\n\nA: When using \"plain RDP\" it is not possible to achieve something similar to Coherence mode. The reason for that is that the Windows host sends a whole desktop to the remote client without any kind of specification as to where one application or window starts and another ends. I.e. it is desktop centric, and not window or application centric.\nIf your Windows computer happens to be running Windows Server (probably not that likely for a home user), then you can enable Remote Desktop Services (previously known as Terminal Services) and enable single-application sharing. That allows you to  use RDP to connect to a single application instead of the whole desktop. It only works for one application though, and does not automatically separate a number of applications automatically like Coherence mode.\nIf you are a programmer (or even a hobby programmer), you can take a look at this project that shows how a Coherence-mode-like feature can be added to RDP. Essentially they add a component to the Windows server that augments the RDP protocol with information about the position and size of each application window - allowing the client to \"cut out\" each window and display it in separate native window frames. The whole desktop is still transferred though, and it comes with a bunch of limitations (note that the project does not include a client for Mac, you'll have to build that yourself).\nIf you look outside the realm of RDP, then a few alternatives exists in the VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure market). This is systems such as the quite common Citrix.\nHowever, a less well known system comes very close to offering something similar to Coherency-mode in Parallels Desktop - not surprisingly it is an offering from the same company, namely Parallels Remote Application Server. Again it is a system that must be installed on the Windows server, and then a special (non-RDP) client is run on the Mac (freely available from the Mac App Store) in order to connect to the applications. The product is marketed at business users primarily, so it is usually not a good fit for home users. The license pricing currently starts at approx. 1.500 EUR per year for a 15-user license (the minimum license size).\n\nA: This is possible using standard RDP. There are many tutorials on how to set this up on a Windows Server, but it is actually possible to do it on Windows 10 Professional, Education and Enterprise versions as well.\nAll you have to do is open up regedit on the Windows machine, then navigate to:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Terminal Server\\TSAppAllowList\n\nDouble click on fDisabledAllowList and set its value from 0 to 1.\nNow, open up your existing RDP file using Apple's default TextEdit. If you do not have an RDP file, open up the Microsoft Remote Desktop app and right click on the PC and select \"Export\".\nNext we are going to modify and add a few lines inside this RDP file.\n\n*\n\n*Modify remoteapplicationmode:i:0 to remoteapplicationmode:i:1\n\n*Add remoteapplicationprogram:s:<path to .exe>, for example remoteapplicationprogram:s:C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\n\n*Add disableremoteappcapscheck:i:1\n\n*Add alternate shell:s:rdpinit.exe\nSave the file and it should work!\nTo open more applications, you can create multiple RDP files and open those. The modified RDP files can also be added again to the Microsoft Remote Desktop app by going to \"Connections\" -> \"Import from RDP file...\" in the menu bar.\nOnce you have multiple windows open, you can access them from the menu bar icon: \n\n", "Q: Temperature Ranges for MBP Battery.

I want to use the new Mic Mode to block background noise, but the option is greyed out when using Zoom.\nHow can I use this new feature with 3rd party apps?\n\n\nA: The third party apps will need to be reprogrammed to call the Apple code that enables this.\n\nIn order to use Mic Modes, your app must adopt the Core Audio AUVoiceIO audio unit. This is a popular interface in video conferencing apps, since it performs echo cancellation. And Mic Mode processing is only available on 2018 and later iOS and macOS devices.

I just installed https://github.com/patrick-zippenfenig/us-with-german-umlauts since I kind of need it because I am used to it. It works perfectly fine, as long as my mouse´s focus is on the MacBook´s own display. It stops working as soon as I am working on an external Display (Samsung 5K G9 if that matters).\nThis behavior applies to both, the MacBooks own keyboard as well as my bluetooth external one.\nIt is a MacBook Pro 14\" with Monterey 12.0. Also, I noticed that my keyboard icon isn´t working on the top right. So it looks like I got two Keyboard Layouts set up, depending on the display focusd.\nDoes someone know how I can fix this?\n\nA: You can show the keyboard icon in the menu bar by going into System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and enabling Show input menu in menu bar.\nSometimes, if you have multiple keyboard layouts enabled, macOS switches them automatically when you switch between apps or windows, which probably happens when you change the focus to a different display.\nWhen this happens, you can switch back manually to your desired layout via the input menu. Alternatively, you can disable this behavior by unchecking Automatically switch to a document's input source, also in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to close the Character Viewer popup window? I have some unicode characters that I like to use. In most programs there is a keyboard shortcut Command+Control+Space to show this window. But then if hit Command-W, I will close the app's main window or tab, not this floating popup. To close the popup, I have to hunt for the little close button in the top left. It annoys me. Is there another keyboard shortcut that can close that window, or any floating window like that?\n\n\nA: Yes, this is absolutely doable.\nSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Tab\nThere's an option to \"Press the fn key to:\" and then a drop down which defaults to \"Do Nothing\".\nChange that drop down to \"Show Emoji & Symbols\". After that, tapping fn toggles the character viewer. Tap once to bring up the viewer, tap again to dismiss it. Works for the compact or full window.\nThis doesn't interfere with pressing and holding fn to invoke F1, F2, etc.\nNewer Magic Keyboards have aglobe /fn key on them which defaults to doing the same thing.\nIf you hit CtrlCmdSpace to bring up the viewer, tapping fn (with the proper setting) will dismiss it.\nFWIW, I hooked up a Keychron mechanical keyboard to a 2015 MacBook Pro running Monterey and tapping fn2 on that thing worked as well.\n\nA: \nIs there a keyboard shortcut to close the Character Viewer popup window?\n\nTechnically yes, it's ⌘W, however, the window has to be active in that its buttons on the upper-left of the window are showing as red, yellow, green, which of course it isn't normally.\n\nThe workaround that I use is an AppleScript script that is triggered by a keyboard shortcut assigned to it in an application named FastScripts. I use: ⌃⌘␣     (shift+command+space)\nThe script requires that the [√] Show Input menu in menu bar is checked in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources.\nThe assigned keyboard shortcut both shows and hides the Character Viewer.\nIn Script Editor, copy and paste the example AppleScript code into a new document and save it as e.g. Toggle Character Viewer in ~/Library/Scripts/.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntry\n    ignoring application responses\n        tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n            click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of ¬\n                application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\"\n    end ignoring\n    \n    delay 0.1\n    do shell script \"killall 'System Events'\"\n    \n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        launch\n        click menu item 1 of menu 1 of ¬\n            menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of ¬\n            application process \"TextInputMenuAgent\"\n    end tell\nend try\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above, was tested in Script Editor and triggered by FastScripts under macOS Catalina and with Language & Region settings in System Preferences set to English (US) — Primary and worked for me without issue1.\n\n*\n\n*1  Assumes necessary and appropriate settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy have been set/addressed as needed.\nIn the example AppleScript code, menu 1 in click menu item 1 of menu 1 of ¬ is either Show Emoji & Symbols or Hide Emoji & Symbols on the actual menu, depending on the state of the Character Viewer window. If one also has Input Sources showing on the Input menu then adjust the number of the menu item accordingly and note that menu separators count in the number count.\nThe example AppleScript code can be used in other applications that have similar capability to run a script and assign a keyboard shortcut.  Hammerspoon is another application that I use for similar things.\nWhile I do not use Keyboard Maestro or Karabiner-Elements, I believe they too can run a script with an assigned keyboard shortcut.\nFastScripts can be used to configure up to 10 script shortcuts for free. To enable unlimited script shortcuts, purchase a license and enter your license info in the Registration pane.\nI am not affiliated with the developer of FastScripts or Hammerspoon, just a satisfied user of the products.\n\nA: That is a good point (you can make at apple.com/feedback).\nI tried several things and what I noticed is that it matters if the Character Viewer window is active. In your example pic, you can tell it is not active because the window management buttons are grey instead of red, grey, and green (the middle, normally yellow, button is not available because there is no full screen mode for dialogs).\nHere's the rub: sometimes I could not make the dialog active in the Notes app but I could consistently with Safari. . In either case, selecting a character to insert did not make the window active. When I could make it active, it required two clicks (either a double click; or click, pause, click) on the title or tool bar. Then, ⌘W worked. However, I could have just clicked once on the close button and be done with it.\n\nIf you decide to submit this feedback to Apple, as I will do, I suggest to you that you suggest to them: Make the Character Viewer dialog a full-fledged app:\n\n*\n\n*Free-standing (currently, if you open the dialog with one app active, it won't be available to another app unless the dialog is invoked again with the second app active)\n\n*Adhere to all the app-level rules (such as following normal commands from menus or keyboard shortcuts including quitting, closing, and the App Switcher)\n\n*Adds the chosen character to the clipboard rather than inserting into the app active when the dialog was invoked so the user can paste into whatever document or text box the user wishes, even multiple times.\n\n*Not always stay on top, frequently obscuring content forcing users to move it around, slowing productivity\n\nOR, make the dialog a pane instead so that with a keystroke or click it pulls down from the window frame and goes away when a character is inserted.\nOR, whatever genius idea you have. Really, we just want someone at Apple to review the viewer and fix the UIX issues.\n\nI use several characters often (⌘, ⌥, ⇥, ⇧, ↵, etc.), so I created keyboard replacements for them. If you have a few you use frequently, avoid the Character Viewer entirely:\n\n*\n\n*Insert a character into Note or document and copy it.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.\n\n*Click [+] at the bottom of the current list.\n\n*Give it a unique string of characters you can remember in the first column headed by \"Replace.\" I use ¡com – the upside down exclamation then com – for ⌘; you can get the upside down exclamation with ⌥1.\n\n*Paste the copied character into the second, \"With,\" column.\n\nChoose whatever is easy for you to use for the leading character, but I recommend sticking with alternative characters you get with the ⌥ modifier key, especially ones easy to type and not something you use regularly. Keep it consistent. Don't be afraid to use more than a couple of defining characters. For example, ¡ plus com (⌘), opt (⌥), tab (⇥), shift (⇧), or return (↵) makes them easy to remember and type.\nThank you for posting your question. I did just tolerate the quirkiness of this dialog but you prompted me to provide my own feedback.\n\nA: If you click the button to the right of the search box, the window becomes a popup that you can dismiss by hitting Esc.\n", "Q: How to write (not so) special characters on non US keyboards I'm working in a programming lab where a lot of students are using the excellent MacBook Air hardware.

Bought it in oct 2016 and has been used decently since (5 years). Obviously, I have started having issues with shorter battery life (coconut battery says 30% - 40% capacity). I am thinking of getting a new battery, but before that I wanted to clarify something.\nWhats weird is that the laptop shuts off (or sleeps) at 80%-90% battery (as said by the indicator at the top). I found this weird as generally, if the battery was bad the battery percentage would drop to 0-10% and then shut off and the battery would drop quickly.

This is detected by power management integrated circuits, which are found at all levels throughout the system and include brownout protection. The PMICs will force a power emergency shutdown rather than risk running the silicon out of spec.\n\n*The SMC, being just another subsystem on the logic board, and being directly powered by the battery, also experiences this brownout -> emergency shutdown cascade. Because there is no backup power to the SMC, it has no way of recording the failure condition in the same manner that it is normally able to record most other failures to provide a nonzero shutdown cause code.\n\n*The reason that this happens without warning at the \"80-90%\" battery charge level is because the battery level is determined by a heuristic algorithm that was built upon empirical, statistical modeling of voltage discharge curves. It is not a direct, real-time measurement of internal battery chemistry. These models are weighted towards newer batteries and they become less and less accurate as the battery ages. For a >5-year-old pack, it's perfectly reasonable to see this kind of sudden shutoff behavior.\n\n", "Q: Mac OS Account on an External Disk? I need a Mac that is often offline for confidentiality. Is it possible to store an Admin or General User account on an external disk which I could only login to when plugged in? In my instance it's not as simple as just storing documents/apps/libraries on an external disk; I need the dynamics of an entire account.\nA variation of this I'm opposed to is logging in through a local network account server I make and then unplugging the disk when not in use, problem being that it opens more vulnerability's than logging into an account on a thunderbolt connected disk; so one might think this isn't an unheard of solution.\nThis would be far less of a hassle than having to manage security precaution and system updates on another Mac.\n\nA: You can also install a complete system on an external ssd and when you want use it, you boot your Mac on this external ssd and all users and system informations will be only inside the external disk.\n\nA: I would copy the entire ~userid to the external disk.  Then, using a different account with admin privileges, delete the original and change the default home directory to the new one.  After which that user can’t log in unless the external disk is mounted.\nIs there any equivalent command for usermod? for more info.\n\nA: Would it work to have the user's home mounted during login?  That would fail if the external was not accessible.  sshfs can mount a remote disk without root privileges if run by the owner of the mount point.  I use it to get local access to my website, but that's a bit different from a home directory.\n", "Q: 2015 13\" MacBook Pro Kernel Panics when waking from sleep For some reason when I wake my Mac from sleep the screen is black and none of the buttons work. Eventually, I get to the \"your computer has restarted because of a problem\" then I press any key to resume startup. Does anybody know why this might be happening?\nI have a link to the log here.\nhttps://pastebin.com/djJrSa0T\nI am on Big Sur and reseting SMC and NVRAM didn't help.\n\nA: The SSD driver is indicating a timeout after 100 seconds of attempting to transition from power-off to power-on states. There are a number of possible causes but one possibility is that your Mac, being the early 2015 MacBook Pro, has experienced significant wear on its SSD and some blocks are beginning to get worn, to the point of requiring grossly excessive time to read and write and tripping the 100 second time limit. However, my instinct is that a failure of this nature would produce a different cluster of behaviors.\nWe should, in every case of panic debugging, enable kernel symbolication so that your future panics contain a richer backtrace. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this panic occurs, your report will have a symbolicated backtrace. Please amend your question with a new link to it.\n\nOne thing that does stick out is that you've installed Intel's Power Gadget, which inserts a kernel extension into your system. Given that your panic occurs during the IOKit power state transition sequence, a reasonable experiment to try would be to run without this KEXT. The best way to do this is by booting in Safe Mode (hold Shift during boot) and trying to reproduce the failure.\nUPDATE:\nAs the failure follows your SSD to another machine and also persists despite the removal of Intel Power Gadget, this gives a lot of support to the SSD being worn. I think you need to migrate your data onto a new drive as soon as possible.\n", "Q: Mac book pro 2020, after water spill, OS keep restarting with the following error Unfortunately my mac got water on it 48 hours ago...\nWhen I connect the mac to the power after several tries it turns on(while doing weird sound like entering a movie or something). When it reaches the Desktop then I have a message notifying that the computer shut down due to a problem with the error below, and after 3-5 minutes it turns off again.\nWorth to say, the touch bar does not working at all.\nCan anyone shed some light regarding this error? is it something with the hardware or might be reformat the OS can help?\n\n\n\nA: dfrd is the Dynamic Function Row Daemon, i.e., the piece of software that talks to the Touch Bar. The fact that your panic signature indicates that dfrd has not sent an \"I'm alive!\" message in 3 full minutes coincides perfectly with the fact that your Touch Bar is nonfunctional.\nAs your troubles only started after you spilled conductive fluid on your machine, the probability is high that you shorted one or more traces that were critical to allowing the Touch Bar to operate properly and for its driver software to communicate with the hardware. macOS apparently considers the Touch Bar to be an essential system component and was, therefore, designed to intentionally halt further operation of the machine when this so-called “essential” component fails.\nYou can run Apple Diagnostics to confirm the hardware damage and then bring your machine to an Apple Store for hardware repair.\n\nA: I had repeat Kernel Panic failure, every 3 minutes.\nBegan with a few drops here and there and the TouchBar LCD failed. The digitizer still functioned so by guessing I could still utilize functions.\nA couple months went by and little did I know that the digitizer failed. This  was the final straw, triggering the watchdog timeout.\nBacked everything up in 3 min increments and began repair.\nTaking apart my A1990 Macbook Pro, replacing the touchbar took about 1.5 hours to complete.\nNo more failures. Reformatted the machine for a fresh start. Maybe this is one of the reasons apple killed off the touchbar?\nDon't take to Apple. Replacement touchbars are incredibly cheap (less than 40 bucks) and you only need a few very cheap and accessible tools.\n", "Q: iMac boot stuck after incomplete uninstall of Kaspersky Internet Security Even though I perfectly knew that it wasn’t the right method to uninstall Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac, I dragged and dropped the app icon on the trash bin.

YMMV\nIf you do not want to have the Bluetooth menu on the menu bar separate from the Control Center, you can use the following example AppleScript code:\n\n*\n\n*The [] Show in Menu Bar checkbox is not checked in: System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar > Bluetooth\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Control Center\"\n        click menu bar item \"Control Center\" of menu bar 1\n        click checkbox \"Bluetooth\" of window \"Control Center\"\n    end tell\n    key code 53 -- # escape key\nend tell\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: This following solution requires Homebrew - The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux) to be installed on your system.\nIn Terminal.app, the command line tool - blueutil, can be installed with this command: brew install blueutil\nAfter successful installation of Homebrew then blueutil, the blueutil can be used in your AppleScript\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/blueutil -p toggle\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Not Require the [√] Show in Menu Bar checkbox to be checked in: System Preferences > Dock & Menu Bar > Bluetooth\n", "Q: macOS applications disk access authorizations In macOS preferences, there is a \"Security and Privacy\" icon.\nIn the \"Privacy\" tab, I can see \"Full Disk Access\" and \"Files and Folders\".\nI can allow specific apps to access to Desktop or Documents folders for example.\nSome applications are not present in \"Full Disk Access\" and \"Files and Folders\". For example Thunderbird. So Thunderbird can access to the whole disk.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Why is Thunderbird not present in the \"Full disk Access\" and \"Files and Folders\" sections?\n\n*How can I add Thunderbird in these sections in order to disallow Thunderbird to access to Documents folder for example ?\n\n*Is it possible to add other folders (for example if I want to protect a subfolder of Documents folder)?\n\n\nA: Thunderbird is not present in this section because its developers didn't believe it was required to opt into this security scheme. For most apps, that means that, when trying to access a protected location, a pop up will ask you if you want to permit it. There are only a handful of protected locations, most of the disk is accessible to any program and if you use directories outside of the protected locations, you cannot control access to them per application.\nThere is a utility that uses undocumented API that allows adding apps and folder permissions. It is found here: https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus\nYou do need to turn off system integrity protection for it to do its job, which is generally not recommended to do for security reasons.\nApple supposedly locked down that feature because it would be too easy for users to be fooled into granting malicious apps permission.\nAlso note that It is not possible to add arbitrary folders, the list is limited to a fixed set of folders to grant access to.\nIf you choose to use this feature, make sure to reenable SIP once done. It is not only more secure, but on a Mac with SIP disabled, you will not be offered to update macOS when new versions come out.\n\nA: You're making an incorrect assumption: apps that aren't listed are not allowed access to \"private\" file & folder areas. Not being listed is equivalent to being listed, but with access denied.\nThe basic idea is that software has to ask for your permission to access private data. Generally, the first time a particular app tries to access a particular category of private data (or use something like the camera or microphone), the system will ask you if that's ok, and your answer will be reflected in the Security & Privacy preferences (and you can change it there). Thunderbird isn't listed because it's never tried to access private file/folder areas.\nI should maybe also explain that macOS actually has three(ish) layers of access restrictions/permissions, and for a program to access something it must be allowed by all of the layers (i.e. any layer can veto access):\n\n*\n\n*macOS has \"normal\" user-based unix file & folder permissions. If you have multiple user accounts on the Mac, this is what restricts your access to each other's files. It also restricts access to a lot of the OS itself (e.g. a non-admin user doesn't have free access to install & remove apps).\n\n\n*Recent versions (since El Capitan v10.11) of macOS also have \"System Integrity Protection\" (SIP), which adds additional protection to the core OS (mostly to limit malware's ability to get around/past the first type of permissions). See my answer here.\n\n\n*Even newer versions (since Mojave v10.14) also have \"Personal Information Protection\" aka \"Transparency Consent and Control\" (TCC), which is the one we're talking about here. This restricts apps' access to certain private categories of files & folders, data, etc, unless you grant the app access. See here for more info.\nNote that the categories of access that can be controlled with TCC are not customizable. For example, you can't decide you want your Public folder to be considered private, and require permission to access. Similarly, you can't apply separate access restrictions to a subfolder of Documents.\nAlso, granting an app \"Full Disk Access\" only grants it that access as far as the TCC layer is concerned; it's still fully subject to SIP and unix permission restrictions.\n\n\n*Application sandboxing could be considered a fourth layer. This one is opt-in for the application, and restricts the app's access to anything outside its private sandbox.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu - macOS Issue I installed Ubuntu in dual boot on my Mac without using rEFInd. Initially everything worked fine, I could access both systems. Later, in an attempt to remove Ubuntu, I deleted a partition I had created for swap and since then GRUB has replaced the Mac's boot loader. So now I can only access Ubuntu. I would like to be able to access macOS again without losing any data. How can I do that?\nThe GParted image shown below was taken while booted to Ubuntu.\n\nUpdate\nThanks to internet recovery, I was able to open the Terminal. Below is the result.\n\n\nA: When the diskutil command or the Disk Utility application is applied to a drive which has Linux type partitions, the partition type GUID stored in the GUID Partition Table (GPT) for a macOS partition is often changed to FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF. The GParted image you posted in your question will not show this change. In other words, if the partition type GUID for /dev/sda2 had been changed from 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC to FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF, then the file system shown in GParted will still remain apfs. This is because GParted looks at the content of the partition to determine the filesystem and not at the partition type GUID. However, the Mac firmware (Mac Startup Manager) does look at the partition type GUID when displaying possible operating systems to boot from.\nOne possible way to determine, if the partition type GUID for /dev/sda2 is 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC, is to view the output from the command shown below. This command needs to be entered in an Ubuntu Terminal application window. (From the Ubuntu desktop, press the key combination option+control+T to open a Terminal application window.)\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nYou should see the code AF0A. If you see code FFFF then partition type GUID is probably FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF. If necessary, you can change the partition type GUID back to 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC by entering the command and interactive input shown below. Here I assume number for this partition is 2. If not, then make the appropriate substitution below.\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\nt\n2\nAF0A\nw\ny\n\n\nNote: The gdisk command uses 4 character codes to represent the much longer partition type GUIDs.\n\nA Clarification Regarding the Question\nIn your question you state \"GRUB has replaced the Mac's boot loader\". Actually, this is impossible. The Mac boot loader is implemented in firmware. In your case, the Macs boot loader is boot loading GRUB and then GRUB is boot loading Ubuntu.\n \n", "Q: Homebrew and qemu security I want to install qemu on a Mac OS computer. I need to install this software with homebrew.\nYou will think I am paranoid but I do not trust third party software, including homebrew, qemu and all the dependencies.\nIs there a way for me to install and run qemu on a single basic user account, or does qemu need a root privilege ?\n\nA: Note that in some circumstances, you do actually need root privileges in order to run ´qemu`.\nMost qemu users on macOS are using the -accel hvf option. If you compile qemu yourself, you will need to codesign it and have the right entitlement on it - otherwise it will require root privileges to manage virtual network interfaces.\n\nA: You shouldn't need to give it root privileges to do anything, unless you are trying to save files in a directory not owned by your account.\nIf you are concerned about giving brew root privileges, you can build qemu from source.\n", "Q: TextEdit saves changes to file without prompting when you duplicate I opened a file and modified the contents, then selected duplicate meaning to save the duplicate as a new file. I closed the original, expecting rekect the prompt to save changes... instead it closed the file with my changes without any prompting at all. My original file is apparently just gone.\nUnless I have found a bug (unlikely) I must be misunderstanding how duplicate functions. In lieu of save-as (from Windows world) what is the correct way to achieve the same thing without risking loss of data?\n\nA: macOS has for some time now, by default, automatically save changes to a document in TextEdit without prompting. Make your duplicate first, close the original, then edit the duplicate.\nIf you want to be prompted, then go to System Preferences > General and check the [√]Ask to keep changes when closing documents checkbox.\nThis works for most all Apple application's and some third-party application's.

This is not for gaming or graphics purposes.\nI know M1 Max contains a great GPU, but I do not need a great GPU.\nIs there a value add for me to buy an M1 Max or M1 Pro for QEMU x86 emulation? I have read M1 Max has a double bus for memory, but I do not understand if this bus is for GPU or RAM memory access.\n\nA: None of the M1 are suitable for X86 workloads. You will want an Intel Mac if performance emulating X86 well enough to run windows (or macOS) virtually is your deciding factor.\nThat won’t stop people from trying, though.\nAll cores on the M1 line so far share memory so GPU and CPU don’t have to shuffle data to different systems. This removes some bottlenecks on other architectures and also drives some of the massive power savings.\n\nA: There is no native support for running i386 apps on M1 or any version of macOS >= 10.15.\nRosetta 2 is only a translation layer that makes x86_64 code (not 32 bit, 64 bit only) runnable on ARM.\nHowever, 32 bit WINE can run on macOS with Apple Silicon. CodeWeavers, the developer of Crossover, a tool that allows Windows apps to run on macOS/Linux, has made 32 bit WINE available on macOS.\nCodeWeavers has made 32 bit Wine available on macOS however, and have made an open source release of the technology as well.\nUsing the brew package manager, you can follow Gcenx's guide on how to install CodeWeaver's wine-crossover package, as well as other tools that aid with using WINE on macOS like Wineskin. It is available: https://github.com/Gcenx/homebrew-wine\nAlternatively, you can purchase CrossOver for Mac, which is CodeWeaver's main WINE product at: https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#mac. It's a packaged version of WINE, offering features like pre-packaged installers for Windows apps that you'd normally handle with Winetricks and other tools.\n\nA: Another way of running Windows application is to use Microsoft Windows 11 running on ARM. Windows for ARM can run some Intel Windows apps as MS provides something similar to Rosetta 2.\nMS and others have rewritten some software to run under ARM so some software will run at full speed and not run via emulation.\nOfficially the Windows 11 licence does not allow running under a Virtual Machine but Parallels, VMWare Fusion and UTM all have instructions to run Windows 11\nUTM containes an emulator so can run OSs that have a different CPU to the host; so can run Intel Windows - However this will not have high performance as it has to emulate all the code whilst Rosetta, MS Windows and wine all convert system calls to native code.\n", "Q: How to share iPhone location with iPad? Now what I don't mean is sending a location manually to the iPad. Consider this scenario: I'm on the road and want to use my iPad for navigation. I prefer it to the iPhone due to the larger display. Unfortunately, the iPad doesn't have GPS. But my iPhone does!\nIs it possible to continuesly share the current location from my iPhone to my iPad? So that apps on my iPad can access my location via location services?\nI've looked into iBeacons. At first that sounded promising. Although there are apps that promise to turn my iPhone into an iBeacon, none of those advertised to continuesly update the location. I'm beginning to have doubts, that an iBeacon is even supposed to update its location.\n\nA: No.\nWhile you can share your iPhones location with your iPad via various Apps or the native Find My feature, Navigation Apps will rely on the location of the iPad - the iPad cannot use the iPhone location as if it were the iPad's own location.\n", "Q: How do I disable an app's display scaling for notch compatibility? I have a 2021 M1 Pro MacBook Pro with a notch at the top of the screen. The OS is macOS Monterey 12.0.1.\nI've seen that there is a setting for scaling down the screen for compatibility with apps that don't account for the notch, but I don't know where this setting is. When I open TeamViewer and fullscreen the window with the remote computer's display in it, macOS automatically scales it for notch compatibility, meaning that the screen shrinks on the top, left, and right. However, the remote computer's display is 16:9 so it wouldn't go behind the notch anyway.\nI would like to disable this compatibility shrinking such that I get to use the full width of my display for TeamViewer (or likewise for any other app). How do I do this?\n\nA: The setting is called \"Scale to fit below built-in camera\", which is a checkbox in the app's info panel:\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and go to Applications\n\n*Find TeamViewer, Right-Click or Ctrl-Click it, and choose Get Info\n\n*Uncheck Scale to fit below built-in camera\n\nWorth knowing that, if you do happen to find an app that has compatibility problems with the notch, this checkbox is available for all non-built-in apps, so you can check it to use this scaled mode!\n", "Q: how handle home folders with dual-boot (Catalina and BigSur)? I am happily running Catalina (on a Macbook Air 2017) and am tempted to upgrade to BigSur, but I'm a little leery of breaking apps, particularly Arduino IDE (which appears problematic, from the little searching I've done).  So I want to make the system dual-boot - my existing Catalina installation, and BigSur (or perhaps Monterey) - and live with the new OS for awhile before I commit.\nThere are numerous articles describing the process, in brief: use Disk Utility to add a new volume, download the appropriate installer, and install the new OS on the new volume.   But beyond that ?\nIt seems there are two ways to go:\n\n*\n\n*Use Migration Assistant to import everything (apps, home folders, other files) to the new BigSur volume, thus two completely independent systems.\n\n\n*Use SystemPrefs -> Users&Groups \"advanced\" to point the home folder (when logged into BigSur) to the Catalina volume.\nIt seems each path has advantages and disadvantages and I'm not sure which to do.  #1 has the disadvantage that there's two copies of user data, thus the issue of keeping in sync - probably best achieved by only modifying files in one.  But #2 has the disadvantage that certain files (e.g. ~user/Library) may need to be different for the new OS (I'm pretty sure that's the case for Arduino IDE).\nHow should I slice this cake ?\nAs requested below, here is the current state of my disk:\n% diskutil list internal\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         239.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +239.8 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume MacHD - Data            88.3 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 91.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                529.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      4.3 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume MacHD                   11.2 GB    disk1s5\n\nAfter installing Big Sur ...\n\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         120.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk2⁩         119.8 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +120.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨MacHD - Data⁩            84.9 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 91.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                529.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨MacHD⁩                   11.2 GB    disk1s5\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +119.8 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk0s3\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨BigSur⁩                  67.3 GB    disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 287.6 MB   disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                625.7 MB   disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 MB     disk2s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Big Sur⁩                 15.3 GB    disk2s5\n   6:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.3 GB    disk2s5s1\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Personally I advise you to separate the 2 systems.\nIndeed if you access Catalina data from a higher system, you run the risk of not being able to access it from Catalina, the compatibility between systems is always upward and rarely downward.\nThen I advise you to create a new container for BS or Monterey so as not to mix up the systems.\nWhen you have tested the new system and if everything is ok, it's easy to clone the new system in place of the old one and free up unused disk space.\n", "Q: Parallels Desktop security I have installed Parallels Desktop on my Macbook M1.\nDuring installation process, Parallels asked my to authenticate with an administrator account. I can see with kextstat command that Parallels has installed kernel modules.\nLet's suppose one of this modules contains a malware. I want to understand what this malware can do on my computer:\n\n*\n\n*If my harddrive is protected with filevault: The malware will only see my current user files ? Or can it read the whole disk (other users accounts)\n\n*If my TCC configuration restricts Parallels application (Documents folder file access disallowed): Do you think the kernel modules will bypass the TCC restriction ?\n\nThanks\n\nA: Modifications to the kernel used to be game over and still are close to game over if you can be compelled or tricked to load arbitrary malware as system or kernel extensions. Game over means you can’t depend on any security working to protect data or tamper with any process running.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/kernel-extensions/\nIt really depends which specific code you load, though. There are layers of security being built so that a network VPN extension might be prevented from bypassing sandbox or reading files. As Apple rolls out these newer more secure designs, and code you install uses the more secure and limited API/SDK potential bugs and malware might be more contained than in the past.\n", "Q: Mac os, external monitor blurry and low res Today I was using my 4k monitor (which I've been using my with current laptop for a very long time and everything was fine). I stepped away from the computer for 5 minutes, when I got back, the monitor was low res and the text is fuzzy.\nI went to the apple menu to try to change the resolution, but now the high resolution options are not available anymore!\nWhat happened here?\nI tried restarting the computer and it didn't work.\nI have the 2020 macbook air with the m1 processor.\n\nA: Even though a restart didn't work. A shutdown followed by power on did work. I wonder why.\n", "Q: Kernel panic on MacBook air 2010 A friend of mine gave me an old MacBook air from 2010. I've never owned any Apple products or anything, so it was more of test laptop than an actual productivity one.\nWhen I first got my hands on it I attempted to make a fresh install of macOS (El Capitan) from the clean copy stored in the drive. A couple of errors later I decide to restart the laptop and then... Kernel panic, endless resets.\nI tried pretty much everything there is. I cannot access the drive's utility, nor safe boot the computer. I restarted NVRAM and the only difference it made was that the boot sound is on.\nI don't own any other Mac devices, but I still managed to make a bootable with El Capitan to restore the system. This is the guide I followed in order to create a bootable from Windows. I used the official El Capitan dmg and a 32GB flash drive. Pressing alt (options) it does give me the prompt for \"restoring\" the system, but when I attempt to it just resets and still tries to load the same version of macOS.\nI can very much see the drive being faulty and/or corrupted and I can certainly spare a few bucks to fix it, but I want to make sure I've done everything there is to fix it. Because I'm not very familiar with the Apple ecosystem I'm at my wits end.\nThe error I get when starting up:\n\nThe error I get when trying to safe boot the OS, which I believe it's a different one:\n\n\nA: Might be some hardware issue causing incorrect reads from the filesystem leading to this crash.\nI would first try to restore (or update) the operating system using Cmd+R, if this doesn't work the HD might be faulty and needs to be replaced.\n\nA: In both cases, the kernel is unable to start launchd, which is the master userspace process that's responsible for starting every other system and user process. It's a significant failure. In your case you see two different failure codes:\n\n*\n\n*When you boot from the Recovery partition in order to attempt a reinstall, you see error code 5, which is an I/O error.\n\n*When you boot from the preexisting install of macOS, you see error code 2, which is a file not found error.\n\nBoth of these errors strongly suggest a corrupted filesystem, at minimum.\nTherefore, my first step would be to try booting from a known-good external installer image. You will need temporary access to another Mac to do this. It will require downloading and unpacking the macOS installer onto an external drive, such as a USB flash drive. Follow the official instructions here.\nOnce you've flashed the external drive, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Attach the newly-flashed external drive to your Mac.\n\n*Reboot while holding the Option key to enter the Boot Picker.\n\n*Choose your external drive and press Return.\n\n*From the macOS Recovery screen, do a full erase of the internal SSD.\n\n*Install macOS.\n\n*Hopefully, if there's no (significant) hardware damage to the SSD, the install will complete successfully. At that point, I would want you to take two extra steps:\n\n*Reboot into Apple Diagnostics (hold D during boot) to give the machine a cursory hardware check.\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold ⌘ CommandR during boot) and run Disk Utility's \"Verify Disk\" tool on your freshly installed macOS.\n\n\nA: I follow the instruction posted in the OP's linked article.  I consider the official official El Capitan dmg to be the InstallMacOSX.dmg file that can be downloaded from a link posted at the Apple website How to get old versions of macOS. I installed Windows 10 20H2 in a VirtualBox virtual machine, then installed Transmac v14.4. Basically, the OP's linked article instructions the user to select \"Restore with Disk Image\" from the InstallMacOSX.dmg file to a USB flash drive, as shown below.\n\nI did this using a 16 GB virtual external USB drive. Next, I created an El Capitan virtual machine and tried booting from this virtual external USB drive. I found the drive was not bootable. Therefore, I believe the flash drive created by the OP would not appear in Mac Startup Manager on the OP's Mac when the option was held down at startup. The OP must have been selecting to boot from the internal drive which probably has been corrupted.\nI would like to think the best and assume the article was not meant to be misleading. I assume referenced dmg file is not officially from Apple and probably would have worked. However, the article failed to include a link to this file.\n", "Q: What is the cause of SSD capacity difference in Intel vs M1 Macs? I recently bought an 14 inch MacBook Pro, which has 512GB SSD storage.\nWhen I check the capacity of the SSD in MacOS, it is reported as 494,38 GB in system report (494.384.795.648 bytes), which is about 5,6 GB less than what it should be (500 GB).\nMy previous MacBook Pro from year 2015, has an intel processor and 256 GB of SSD storage, and its capacity is reported as 250,79 GB (250.790.436.864 bytes).\nThinking that this 5,6 GB could be a difference specific to M1 Macs, I searched the internet and also found out that 256 GB SSDs of M1 devices are reported as 245,11 GB, which supports my hypothesis.\nSo, what is Apple using this 5,6 GB of SSD storage in M1 Macs? Did they start to do something like SSD provisioning? Caching to speed up things and etc with M1 Macs?\n-- Later edit: As requested, I have added output of more detailed commands below. It looks like M1 Pro machine has an additional 5.4 GB recovery partition. which explains the difference. But now I wonder, why does my Intel machine does not have a recovery partition? The Intel machine had Os Mojave on it when I got it, I upgraded the OS to first Catalina, then Big Sur from inside MacOS as usual.

Your listing of diskutil list disk0 Is where to focus.\nLastly, note that 256 GB (gigabytes) is a software / decimal measure corresponding to 238.4 GiB (gibibytes) which is the hardware / binary measure.\nSSD work differently than magnetic media in that the controller always has more storage built than the raw capacity since rather than marking blocks as bad, they ship over provisioned. This allows the storage controller to substitute groups of storage cells to balance wear leveling (reliability) needs with speed, durability and power consumption trade offs.\nThe main difference you should pay attention to is which storage controller is in play. Intel can have traditional storage or an Apple T2 chip. The Apple Silicon hardware uses a controller built into the SOC.\n", "Q: history -d does not remove history entry, but shows time of history entry In its documentation, https://ss64.com/osx/history.html it says the -d parameter followed by ID of the history entry will remove an entry from command history.

In the preferences I have the \"New windows open with default profile\" selected.\nThe error I'm getting is:\n[Command not found: telnet]\n\n[Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.]\n\n\nA: Install telnet and add its installation directory to the Launch Services PATH:\nsudo launchctl config user path \"$(sysctl -n user.cs_path):$(dirname \"$(command -v telnet)\")\"\n\nThis assumes that launchctl getenv PATH returns an empty string and that telnet is in the shells PATH.\nExplanation\nApplications can register their ablility to handle the telnet:// URL Scheme with Launch Services, like Terminal.app has done in /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist:\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n  <dict>\n    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n    <string>telnet URL</string>\n    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>telnet</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n\nBut telnet is no longer provided by macOS, so we have to install it ourselves, by brew install telnet or by following a guide of How to Get Telnet.\nHowever, even after the installation it still might fail:\n$ open telnet://localhost:23\n\n[Command not found: telnet]\n\n[Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty.]\n\nIt fails when the Launch Services PATH does not contain the telnet installation directory. The current value of this PATH can be printed with launchctl getenv PATH; if empty, the default is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin as seen by sysctl -n user.cs_path. Those directories are all under System Integrity Protection so we could/should not have installed telnet to any of them.\nWe fix this by adding the telnet installation directory to the PATH with launchctl config user path <value>, see launchctl(1).\nUndo\nReset the Launch Services PATH to default with:\nsudo launchctl config user path \"\"\n\n\nA: telnet is no longer included by default in macOS installs, as it is a rarely-used and extremely insecure protocol. When you do have a need for it, you can install it by using one of the standard macOS software port repositories, such as Homebrew, or by compiling and installing it yourself from source. gnu netutils contains one such implementation.\nIf you're able to simply run telnet from inside Terminal, then that means that you've already installed it somewhere and it's able to be located via your PATH environment variable. You can use which telnet to see where it lives. You can then use that explicit path for your Terminal profile settings.\nUPDATE:\nHere are steps to configure Terminal to run telnet at startup.\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Navigate to Terminal > Preferences.\n\n*Choose the Profiles tab.\n\n*In your default profile, click the Shell tab.\n\n*In the field that says \"Run command:\" replace the existing command with the absolute path to telnet. In your case, that would be /opt/homebrew/bin/telnet.\n\n*You may optionally enable or disable the \"Run inside shell\" option according to your tastes.\n\n\nA: Got it working.\nOnly solution that finally fixed it was to disable SIP, disable authenticated root, mount the root partition, copying telnet to /usr/bin and then committing the changes to the partition.\nTelnet works like a charm now.\n", "Q: Does transferring data from iPhone to iPhone using Quick Start keep Screen Time? I have a phone that has Screen Time on it, and I some how messed up the reset screen time passcode. I've got a new phone and I want to transfer the data from this phone to the new phone. If I use Quick Start to transfer the data will it keep the Screen Time?\n\nA: Yes. Transferring or restoring the phone with a backup will also pass on the Screen Time restrictions.\nIf you know the password of the the Apple ID used to setup the passcode, you can follow this instructions to reset it:\nOn an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your device is updated to iOS 13.4 or iPadOS 13.4 or\nlater.\n\n*Go to Settings > Screen Time.\n\n*Tap Change Screen Time Passcode, then tap Change Screen Time\nPasscode again.\n\n*Tap Forgot Passcode?\n\n*Enter the Apple ID and password* that you used to set up the Screen Time passcode.\n\n*Enter a new Screen Time passcode, then enter it again to confirm.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211021\n", "Q: How do I know how much space createinstallmedia needs? I want to make a Bootable installer, and to save on physical space (having a bunch of flash drives laying around), I decided to have a drive in MacOS Extended (Journal) format partitioned to contain multiple bootable / install medias, or what would be multiple USBs of bootable media all in one drive.\nIn order to save space, how would I know how much space each install application's createinstallmedia tool will need? When I say this, I mean that I have my partitions set up as 8 GB or 16 GB when in reality (for example) the El Capitan installer) will take up only ~6.3 GB, and I can not shrink the partition size without making another useless partition I can't put another bootable media on.\nAdmittedly, I could just run createinstallmedia on a partition too big for the job, then get the amount of space taken up, delete the partition and make it with the space created back then. However, when you scale this up, it is not time efficient and remember that I want to do this for multiple installers.\n\nA: You could use the Disk Utility to create a sparse disk image (.sparseimage file) or read/write disk image (.dmg file). Mount the the image, then have the createinstallmedia tool write to the image. You can inspect the image to see how much disk space was needed.\n\nA: On a GUID drive, you can create the first install \"createinstall\" on the entire media. Then you search the real size of this installer :\ndiskutil resizevolume diskxsy limits\n\nYou can then resize this installer with the previous information :\ndiskutil resizevolume diskxsy xxg jhfs+ New_installer 0b\n\nAnd so on for the news installers\n", "Q: Can I run live linux with a 2007 iMac that doesn’t show macOS on the gray OS selector screen? I have an old iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007) that has a white screen on boot that shows an EFI drive only and no macOS. I used my Windows 10 laptop with balena.io/etcher to create a live version of Pop!_OS Linux. By pressing the Alt button, I was able to get into the Mac Startup Manager and I was able to plug in the live version of Pop!_OS Linux and see it, However, I was not able to click on it and use it.\nAlso, when I went into the Mac Startup Manager, I didn't see a partition for OS X. Therefore, I am assuming the drive in the system is dead. So I am just looking to boot from a live version of Linux.\nAlso, I tried the Linux live drive on a MacBook Pro 2013 and it worked.

I downloaded POP!_OS 20.04 LTS (pop-os_21.04_amd64_intel_10.iso) and used balenaEtcher (Version 1.5.64) on an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) running macOS High Sierra (Version 10.13.6) to create the live flash drive installer. I was able to boot a live version of Pop!_OS Linux on the iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007). I was using a wired keyboard and mouse.

According to the developers, apparently Apple has updated the coding requirements and the developers are saying the app needs to be recoded in order to remain viable and that perhaps 300 hours or more would be required.  The difficulty is said to derive from \"Cordoba\" being used as a framework for the original development. (I am not a developer or coder)\nIs it true that this is not a daunting task and that recompiling with the latest iterations of Swift/X-Code is possible and requires little effort?\nMany thanks for any help with this question.\n\nA: The coder most probably meant Cordova, and not Cordoba. The latter does not exist, but Apache Cordova is a relatively popular app development framework.\nFrom your question I get the impression that you think the original app developers are lying to you, or are incompetent, and they're taking a 2 hour job and quoting it at 300 hours. If that is the case, you have lost trust in your developers and that never ends well.\nIt is completely impossible for anyone here to judge whether this is a 300 hour, 150 hour or 5 hour job, with the information given in the question. Consider going to your developer and ask them why this task is a 300 hour job - they should be able to provide you with a description of what needs to be done.\nIf you have lost trust in your developers, I would suggest getting a quote from a different developer. Note that you risk that they qoute you low, and end up spending just as much time as the others would have done.\n", "Q: Why is passcode required to enable Face ID after just one failed attempt sometimes?

This is not a typical crash and suggests one of three possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*You are completely out of disk space.\n\n*You are out of RAM (and also out of disk space such that virtual memory would fail to help)\n\n*The file is corrupted.\n\n\n\n*I ruled out #1 and #2 by asking you to run df -h and vm_stat, respectively, and found that you have ample storage space and available RAM. This means that we have to consider #3, that the file is corrupted.\n\n\n*Given what you said about just having performed a major OS upgrade, I suspected that something worse might have happened: Your entire filesystem might have corruption. So we checked by booting into Recovery and running Disk First Aid.\n\n\n*Unfortunately, my suspicions were correct: Your hard disk is corrupted.\nNow that we know what the real issue is, you need to follow the usual process of dealing with filesystem damage:\nStop using your machine immediately. Turn it off as soon as it's practical. Do not attempt to repair the disk. Do not power the machine back on until you're ready to recover data. Any time the drive is powered on, you are risking further damage.\nThen:\n\n*\n\n*If you have a known-good, up-to-date backup of all of your data, the easiest path is to do a full erase & install of macOS and restore your data.\n\n*If you don't have a full backup, you will need to place your Mac into Target Disk Mode and use a second Mac to transfer your files – most critical ones first! – onto a rescue drive. Be aware that this process can introduce new damage on your corrupted drive, so be tactical about which files get rescued first. You should expect that certain rescued files may themselves contain corrupted data. You may also find that you get strange failures when you attempt to rescue the files; this is all due to the corruption.\n\n*Once you've recovered all the files you need, do a full erase & install and restore, as above.\n\nFinally, any time that a drive gets corrupted, there is always the possibility that it happened due to a further underlying root cause. Therefore, after your data is backed up & restored and you have macOS reinstalled:\n\n*\n\n*Use Apple Diagnostics to do a basic check of your hardware health.\n\n*Boot into Recovery again to re-scan your drive to ensure it doesn't have new corruption.\n\n*Maintain at least one consistent backup at all times (via Time Machine or otherwise) and be vigilant for new strange behavior.\n\n", "Q: How Can Macbooks Be Connected to Portable Displays? How can a Macbook be connected to a portable display so people accustomed to large monitors can have a second display when working in a vacation home, hotel, or other home-away-from home?\n\nA: An iPad with Apple Sidecar.  If you already own an iPad it's an obvious choice.  It's easy and wireless (except requires charging).   It's also extremely light and space-efficient.\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already own an ipad it's a relatively expensive solution.\n\n*It's small unless you go with the 13 inch Pro but if you can spend $1100 on a 13 inch travel monitor you probably can afford to have your advance team set up your workstation before your arrive :)\n\n*It requires that both devices be signed in to iCloud.  Fine if you already do that, maybe unacceptable if you've chosen not to.\n\n\n\nA: An Android tablet with an Airplay receiver app.\nA 10 inch Android tablet can be thin, light and robust.  It can be completely wireless, just needs charging. In addition to being your monitor you also have a tablet you can use and it's a great digital photo frame with the right app, and great for kids or you to play games.   Unlike Sidecar the Airplay receiver app works locally and doesn't require either device to \"join\" anything.\nIt's much more cost effective than a physically similar iPad with Sidecar if this is the sole purpose.\nIf you happen to own a large (14 inch say) Android tablet it might be an excellent choice but they are a lot more expensive than the ubiquitous 10 inch ones.\n\n\nA: A self-supporting wired portable display.\nA standalone display designed for portability is one way.\nA 15\" portable monitor with a built-in kick stand may be the most economical approach to large screen real estate, thinness and and light weight at low cost.   It's big enough to double as a display for movies or slide shows and can slip into your Macbook protective sleeve.\nAt time of writing there are 15.6\" FHD IPS ones available at $145 and  12 inch ones for under $100 that weigh only 1.3 lbs.\nCons:\n\n*\n\n*It can only be used on a desk and with power.  If you're sitting on a bed or in a car, not that you really would need a second monitor, but the fully wireless options are not there.\n\n*It's only a monitor.  When not being used as a travel monitor it has no other use.  But for the price you can afford to make it part of your travel kit.\n\n*Cables.  It needs two cables, one for power and one for video from your Mac, and on a Macbook with two ports it consumes one of them .. or you need to add a little port replicator to your bag, which isn't such a big deal.\n\n\n\nA: A lid-mounted slideout monitor.\nSimilar to a self-standing portable monitor but designed to attach to your laptop lid and slide out from behind it.  These look nice but are not effective at their job.  They have all the cons of all the other options, and no pros.  They are small.  They make the laptop top-heavy so the lid has to be vertical.  It's hard to point them the exact way you want.  And the hardware for storing them on your lid, and sliding them in and out, makes them heavy and expensive.  They require cables.  They cannot be used for anything else (they are not tablets, just monitors).  They are not as good at sharing,eg movies or slide shows as a larger, cheaper, more versatile standalone 15 inch model.\nThey ARE good if used in a setting where there is not enough desk space to stand a standalone monitor.\n\n\nA: [No!] A convertible or detachable Chromebook with Airplay.\nNote: at this time you can't have an airplay receiver on a Chromebook.  It doesn't work. I tried installing one from Google Play.  It runs, it broadcasts and is visible to the Macbook as an Airplay display but the Macbook cannot actually connect to it because of the limitation noted in that link.\nPerhaps there are other third-party apps that would need to be installed on both the Macbook and Chromebook, with connection initiated from the Chromebook?\nAlso, if said Chromebook happens to be one your child got from school it is probably policy-locked out of Google Play so you can't install anything on it anyway.\n\n", "Q: First setup of iPhone SE without WiFi and iTunes Suppose the situation you bought iPhone SE in an area where is no WiFi (or you need to tell the iPhone's MAC address to the system administrator first) and you do not have a computer at all.\nHow to get through the first setup wizard?\n\nA: iPhones require a connection in order to set up, because the set up process requires the phone check in with Apple, even if it isn't set up on a carrier yet.\nYou can either use the carrier (if you have an active SIM), WiFi, or a computer. If you don't have any of these there is not a way to set up the device.\n", "Q: Can I substitute my VPN subscription with macOS's Private Relay? TL;DR: Title.\n\nI see that macOS's Private Relay essentially relays the internet traffic from my iMac to an internet endpoint (or rather an internet traffic light) in a way that neither Apple nor the visited website fully knows where the traffic originated from/is going to.\n\nWhen browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a\nuser’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website\nthey are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s\nnetwork provider. All the user’s requests are then sent through two\nseparate internet relays. The first assigns the user an anonymous IP\naddress that maps to their region but not their actual location. The\nsecond decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them\nto their destination. This separation of information protects the\nuser’s privacy because no single entity can identify who a user is and\nwhich sites they visit.\n\n\nSo, is it time to stop paying for VPN?\nThe specific cases I use VPN for are:\n\n*\n\n*Unlocking geolocation specific content;\n\n*Unlocking lower prices for services available in other countries;\n\n*Preventing data hoarders from knowing my actual location when surfing; and\n\n*Downloading torrents.\n\n\nA: While it will depend on the actual use case, the general answer is that Private Relay is not a true substitute for VPN.\n\nWhile similar in idea, the specific cases where Private Relay and VPN differ are:\n\n*\n\n*Private Relay only works on Safari: In a typical Apple fashion, you do not get the benefits of Private Relay if you use anything other than Safari. I verified it by opening an IP tracing website to find what my IP was being seen by it. Got different results on Safari and Firefox. Firefox exposed my actual IP; Safari didn't.\n\n\n*You cannot change countries, using Private Relay. Private Relay has only two options as of today:\n\n*\n\n*General Location, close to your actual location. So if you are in zipcode 12345, it will relay you to an endpoint close to that zip code. This enables that you get location-specific suggestions if you prefer while masking your true location.\n\n*Country and Time Zone. ..which is even more general than 'General Location' and typically shows you close to a metro city in your time zone, in your country.\n\nAs a result, if you are in the US, for example, you cannot change your country to Canada to access content that's available in Canada but not in the US.\n\n\n*Private Relay may not be available in your country. And as a result, VPN may be your only solution.\n", "Q: Open custom URL from spotlight I'm trying to build an automation where I could type in Spotlight something like \"open 234\" and it will open a web browser to \"https://myweb.com/234\".\nIs this possible in to do maybe using an Automator workflow or AppleScript?\n\nA: I've ended up switching from Spotlight to Alfred. This task is easily attainable even without Powerpack, just go to Features -> Web search and add a custom provider.\nNow I could view Jira ticket in Safari as simple as cmd + space -> j 1111 -> enter.\n", "Q: Text shortcuts are constantly erased with macOS Monterey I noticed that with macOS Monterey, my text shortcuts (System Preferences → Keyboard → Text) can never stay put and are erased every time I add them (not quite sure when, but surely soon after).\nIs this known? Are there any workarounds?\n\nA: I created an account just to share that I found out how to fix this!\nIt was driving me crazy.\nFix: Make sure you're signed in to your Apple ID. The Monterey update automatically signed me out, and since the System Preferences > Keyboard > Text shortcuts are synced up with your Apple ID/iCloud, it wipes them every time you restart the computer because it syncs back to nothing.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Experienced the same bug in Monterey 12.2.1, i.e., losing text replacements on every boot. Not using iCloud. Worked around by recreating entries, backing them up, and restoring after reboot:\nBackup\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Keyboard → Text\n\n*Edit → Select All → drag selected replacements to Desktop (\"Text Substitutions.plist\" will be created)\n\nRestore\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Keyboard → Text\n\n*Drag \"Text Substitutions.plist\" from Desktop into the Text pane\n\nLink courtesy of Kevin.

Has anyone else seen this process? It's not consuming much CPU time or RAM, but I have never seen it before.

When copy pasting it from the Homebrew site,\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nYou have to add -k to it to tell curl to \"insecure\" the site.

I want to delete this file since it's zero bytes. But I have tried sudo rm .file, sudo rm -f .file, sudo chmod -R 777 .file all failed. Any idea?\n\n\nA: There's absolutely no reason to delete the file. Note that the file does not take up space on your drive.\nThe file is not a usual file put there by some program, you've installed. It is part of the operating system, and comes with the macOS installation. It is not meant to be removed.\nThe file is there to support the operating system feature known as \"file reference URLs\":\nNormally, you know files by their name and folder placement - for example ~/Documents/Letter.docx.\nHowever it is also possible to reference the exact same file by way of this special file, you're concerned about. The same file could be referenced by something similar to /.file/id=123.45. This is in many ways similar to using the /.vol special file which is part of volfs (accessing files by volume number and inode), and similar to referencing files by their inode number alone (only valid on the same file system).\nThe advantage of this is that a running application can be given a specific file as a normal path/filename, and then reference it by a file reference URL such as for example file:///.file/id=123.45. This means that even if the user decides to rename or move the file in the file system, the application can still open and access it without knowing about those changes. This is something that typically comes into play when the user drags and drops files on applications.\nNote that the file reference URL is a non-persistent reference - meaning that if you unmount that part of the file system, or if you reboot the computer, the URL becomes invalid.\n", "Q: Stop F8 key from launching Music (the new iTunes) (macOS 10.15.7 on MacBook Pro 13\" 2020 Intel-based)\nI would like to keep using the F-keys as standard function keys (without the need of pressing fn at the same time). I even want to keep the general Play/Pause function of F8. I just want to stop F8 from launching the application Music. Is it possible?\n\nA: If you don't need/use Apple Music, you can install noTunes to stop it from launching, note that this stops you from even opening it manually. You will also need to set it to start on login.\n\nA: The exact method may differ between MacBook models and macOS versions, but generally, the option to swap function key behavior is in “keyboard” pane of system preferences.  More specific instructions in this apple support document.\n", "Q: Mac forgets window-workspace association on monitor disconnect Since moving to a new macbook, I've encountered a problem. I'll have several windows spread out across multiple Spaces, like the following illustration based off of the mission control view:\n\n(Apologies for the silly drawing.) After connecting and disconnecting to my external monitors, the windows all get chucked to the first Space, like so:\n\nNow I need to drag all the windows back to their appropriate Spaces/Desktops. I'm used to windows getting slightly outta whack when disconnecting from monitors, but I could use Moom to return to normal. However my understanding is that there's no OS API to move windows between spaces.\nI have \"Displays have separate spaces\" unchecked.\n\nA: With \"Displays have separate spaces\" unchecked, then it is behaving correctly.\nYour apps are not on three spaces, they're on one, across three displays… so when you disconnect the others, the Mac correctly brings the apps back into the remaining screen. It cannot anticipate your ever adding those screens back again. You would lose the apps off-screen if that were the case.\nThe odd thing in your drawing is that your top bar of Mission Control ought to have it laid out that way - those apps should not all be next to each other as 3 Spaces visible next to each other on one display, they should each be on its own screen, all with the same numbered Desktop label.\nThis is what I see on mine, with two displays & 7 Spaces 'sets'.\n\nClick for larger version\nI've roughly Photoshopped one above the other rather than side by side, one on each screen. They're mainly empty right now, but if you look at the left-most pair, Desktop 1, that's the one I have most of my day-to-day oprganisation on. Safari to the left, then Finder; and on the right display, Calendar, TextEdit, RDC, Maps, Activity Monitor etc.\nIf I disconnect the right display, everything jumps over to the left display, so I don't lose it, & gets annoyingly intermingled. I try to never do that, of course.\nWith that setup, you're probably better off enabling \"Displays have separate spaces\" & then setting each of those apps in a different Space. You do need at least one more Space than you have displays to do that properly. Then, if you remove a display, the \"Space\" should be remembered.\nIf you use apps in fullscreen, then all the above is moot, because fullscreen apps break almost every Spaces protocol; cannot be numbered, will not stay where you put them & come up in random order each time they're invoked… [amongst the many reasons I never use fullscreen;)\n\nA: Updating the OS from 12.0 to 12.0.1 fixed this. (That or it just needed a restart, but I [90% confidence] already had restarted it.)\n", "Q: Codesigning PHP 8 in Monterey Following this guide: How to sign homebrew PHP module in macOS\nI'm stuck on step five:\n\nLocate location or path of PHP module from Apache's PHP LoadModule directive.\n$ grep -nir \"^loadmodule.*php\" /etc/apache2\n/etc/apache2/other/00-httpd.conf:4:LoadModule php7_module >/opt/homebrew/opt/php@7.4/lib/httpd/modules/libphp7.so\n\n\nI keep running into the error:\n\nzsh: no such file or directory: /etc/apache2/other/00->httpd.conf:4:LoadModule\n\n\nI've located my install of PHP at the following path:\n\n/usr/local/opt/php@8.1/8.1.0_3/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so\n\nBut it seems to be some sort of error with /etc/apache2/other/00->httpd.conf - there doesn't even seem to be a httpd.conf file at that location.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: In case anyone on an Intel chip runs into the same problem, the way I solved this in the end:\n\n*\n\n*Skip step 5\n\n\n*Go straight to step 6 and codesigning it at this location: >/usr/local/opt/php@8.1/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so\n\n\n*Also: Nothing is generally located in the \"other\" folder, i.e.: /etc/apache2/other/00-httpd.conf\n\n\n*Instead use /etc/apache2/00-httpd.conf\n", "Q: Separate keyboard layout for each window in macOS Monterey Is there a way to set up keyboard layouts preferences to have a separate layout for each window?\nUse case described step by step:\n\n*\n\n*I use two keyboard layouts: English and non-English one.\n\n*I often open Terminal, where I use English layout.\n\n*And I often chat in another app using my native language.\n\n*I am tired of switching global keyboard layout back and forth.\n\n*I would like macOS to remember, which layout was last-used in each window.\n\nEspecially interesting, if it is possible to do with native tools or settings in Monterey rather than 3rd party app. Just like it is possible to do in Linux with a single click in Input methods settings.\nPS: there is the same question here, but the answer is outdated. There is no such setting anymore. At least in Monterey.\n\nA: I have finally found a solution! There is a tool called Punto Switcher.\nIt is available for macOS and works almost perfectly for Russian-English case.\nOne needs to install it and grant it permission to operate in Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility\nThen - turn on a per-application keyboard layout. The bad thing is it is not per-window! Good thing, at least it is per application.\nIn addition, there is an auto-switch for cases when you forget to switch your layout. And there is a way set exceptions: those applications where auto-switch will not work (you don't want your terminal to auto-switch from English to Russian XD)\nPS as recommended HERE, I've tried Karabiner, but had no luck.

The man page of mdfind says the following:\n\nThe mdfind command consults the central metadata store and returns a list of files that match the given metadata query. The query can be a string or a query expression.\n\nOne would assume that the \"central metadata store\" references store.db under .Spotlight-V100 (as indicated in this answer) but mdls, which I assume uses the same \"central metadata store\", seems to work fine without any of the Spotlight files present. I tried the following command on Catalina (10.15.7) and there was no delay in displaying the output of mdls, indicating that the command does not utilise the Spotlight DB.\nsudo rm -rf /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100 ~/Library/Metadata/CoreSpotlight/ \nmdls ~/Downloads/MacVim.dmg\n\nManually using Spotlight with CommandSpace on the other hand launches a lot of mdworker_shared processes and re-creates the .Spotlight-V100 directory.\nI also do not see how mdls and mdfind could be using extended attributes, as indicated in this answer, since invoking xattr -l ~/Downloads/MacVim.dmg does not produce any output while mdls ~/Downloads/MacVim.dmg shows several kMD* attributes.\n\nA: mdfind consults the Spotlight database in order to provide search results faster than scanning the whole file system for each query.\nmdls on the other hand does not rely on the Spotlight database, as it doesn't need to scan the file system - you're specifying the file you want to examine directly. It does however rely on the Spotlight API in order to provide the data requested.\nI.e. mdls is not a program that contains code that tries to \"parse\" all sorts of file types or gather information information from many place. Nor does it directly look this up in the store.dbfile.\nWhen you request the metadata for a specific file through the Spotlight API, information is gathered from a number of places and given to the program (mdls in this case) in a uniform format. These sources are for example:\n\n*\n\n*the file system meta data\n\n*the extended attributes stored in the file system\n\n*information from Application bundles and similar places\n\n*information gathered by the Spotlight importer plugin for the specific file type\n\nNote that some importer plugins are external - i.e. small programs stored seperately from Spotlight itself. For example in /System/Library/Spotlight you'll typically find importers for things such as audio files, video files, compressed archives, etc. Similarly applications can come with their own Spotlight importers, stored in locations such as for example:\n/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter\n\nIn this case for importing data from Outlook into Spotlight.\nOther plugins are internal - i.e. they're selfcontained within Spotlight and do not require external programs. Your example in the question was for a .dmg file, and the importer for those is internal.\nYou can run the importer for a specific file to see exactly what attributes it would have given to the Spotlight index - without actually changing the Spotlight index. Run a command like this:\nmdimport -t -d2 ~/Downloads/MacVim.dmg\n\nNote that -d2 means that you see all the imported metadata attributes, except for kMDItemTextContent which in the case of a document would typically be very large and not preferable to see in a Terminal output. You can view that attribute as well by using the -d3 argument instead.\nAs these importers are effectively run as general purpose programs, the data sources for the importers themselves can be almost anything. I.e. it is not restricted to returning data found in the file system itself - it could even give attributes found by consulting cloud servers over the network (for example when you have a file stored in iCloud).\n", "Q: How do I stop all iPad notifications?

How do I know the cached data Apple provides me via its Mail Privacy Protection feature when I open a mail is not malicious?\n\nA: Mail Privacy Protection protects your privacy by fetching content linked to mails only once (so senders don‘t see your IP and also don‘t see how often you access certain content or how long it takes you to access content once you‘ve received a mail).\nIt doesn’t protect against malicious content behind such links, so you may still get viruses and malware through attachments or mail links.\n", "Q: What does Apple call the feature where an arbitrary app can react to text in your e-mail?

Or is there like a \"sandbox\" mode for this purpose?\n\nA: If you're okay with rebooting, you can do this easily without using virtual machines:\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and select your Macintosh HD on the sidebar.\n\n*Click the [+] Volume button in the toolbar and enter a disk name of your choosing\n\n*Download the macOS Monterey / Big Sur installer and run it, selecting your new volume\n\n*When rebooting, hold option (Intel) or keep pressing the power button (Apple Silicon) to choose which volume to run.\n\n\nA: The easiest method is probably to install a virtual machine with a clean macOS install and test your software from there. You'll need virtualization software such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop (both requires a paid license) or VirtualBox (free alternative).\n\nA: Macs can boot an external USB fob.\nSuper easy. Get any respectable USB \"fob\" and format it in Disk Utility. Then run the OS installer and tell it to install on the USB fob.\nWhen it comes time in the installation to reboot the Mac, hold down \"option\" to tell it. you want to pick the boot volume.  Pick the external USB fob that you just installed the OS on. Now you will boot off that.\nNow run Software Update and patch to the latest patch level for that version of the OS.  (you can even upgrade to more modern OS if your hardware supports it).\nDismount your other boot volumes so they aren't corrupted\nThere is one wrinkle: your internal/main hard drive or SSD will now be visible as an auxiliary drive.  That can sometimes cause complications with applications; for instance iTunes and Photos will go on a grand \"fishing expedition\" looking for iTunes libraries and Photos/iPhoto libraries on non-boot drives, will find your main drive's libraries, and corrupt them.\nYou can make sure that never happens by following the steps given in the next section to establish an fstab to automatically dismount every boot volume but this one. Now when you boot your external fob, your internal hard drive will NOT be mounted and will not be visible.  You can \"bring it back\" manually by launching Disk Utility and mounting it.\nAll my boot volumes have the same exact fstab, which dismounts all my boot volumes.  (the active volume fails to dismount itself).\nPrevent a volume from mounting at startup\nThe text below was authored by by user etresoft at Apple Community. The suggestion offered by user hyphen was incorporated into the text.\nSometimes, it can be useful to prevent a given volume from mounting at boot. You might want to hide an old OS version from Spotlight corruption. You just might not want to clutter your desktop.\n\nNote: Encrypted disks are unlocked before the fstab file is read. In order for this procedure to work with an encrypted disk, you must first mount the disk, unlock it, and save the password in your keychain.\n\nTo do this, you will need basic understand of how to enter Terminal commands and use vi.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the disk you want to prevent mounting at boot is mounted.\n\n\n*Launch Terminal.\n\n\n*Run the following command to print out information about the disk:\ndiskutil info /Volumes/<volume that shouldn't be mounted>\n\n\n\n*Locate the line that starts with: Volume UUID:. Select the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that follows on the rest of the line. It will be something that looks like FF9DBDC4-F77F-3F72-A6C2-26676F39B7CE. Your value will be different\n\n\n*Copy the UUID to the clipboard.\n\n\n*Navigate to /etc by typing the following and pressing enter:\ncd /etc\n\n\n\n*Edit (or create) an fstab file by typing the following and pressing enter:\nsudo vifs\n\n\n\n*Enter the following line, substituting the UUID you copied in step 5. (Note: vifs uses the value of the EDITOR environment variable to pick the text editor to use. This article assumes you are using the default value of vim.) In vim, the editor starts in command mode. To add a new line, use the arrow keys to move to the end of the document and press the o key to append a new line and enter edit mode. Then type the following:\nUUID=FF9DBDC4-F77F-3F72-A6C2-26676F39B7CE none apfs rw,noauto\n\nand press the return key.\n\n\n*Type escape to return to command mode and then type ZZ (shift key down) to save and exit vifs (or some other method to save and exit if you are using something other than vim).\n\n\n*Type the following and press enter to reset the auto mounter:\nsudo automount -vc\n\n\n\n*Quit Terminal\nNow, the next time you restart, or unplug the drive in the case of an external drive, that volume will not be mounted. All you have to do is launch Disk Utility, select the grey, disabled volume, and click the Mount button.\nYou should be able to use a different text editor than vifs if you want. It needs to be able to edit and save files owned by root.\n\nNote: If all of your disks are encrypted, there is an easier method. For any disk that you don't want to automatically mount, simply don't save the password to the keychain.\n\n", "Q: transfer music library from iTunes on Mojave to another computer with Apple Music on Monterey I have one computer running Monterey (Mac Pro) and another one running Mojave (Macbook pro). I want to transfer my iTunes music library (all audio files and playlist and rating information) from the Mojave computer to the Monterey computer so I can listen to them in the new music app on the newer machine and ultimately pair the new machine with an iphone.\nAll the audio files are currently on the Monterey machine in:\n/Users/username/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Music/\nHow do I do this? Presumably I could transfer the audio files to the new machine and import them to the Music app, but that wouldn't necessarily get all the library information and playlists.\nI don't want to upgrade the OS on the old machine to go through the iTunes->Apple Music transition. I also don't want to transfer ALL the data on the old machine to the new one with Migration Assistant or something, but I would be fine with just transfering the audio files.\n\nA: I believe I have (mostly) successfully done this now. The steps were:\n\n\n*Delete the ~/Music/Music on the new machine\n\n*Copy the iTunes folder to the new machine and put it in ~/Music to create ~/Music/iTunes\n\n*In iTunes on the old machine do \"Export Library\" to make a Library.xml file\n\n*Transfer the Library.xml file to the new computer\n\n*Open Apple Music and go to File > Library > Import Playlist and import the Library.xml file from the previous step.\nThis was the trick. There is a temptation to do File > Import but that did nothing.\n\nMusic files, playlists, ratings, and play counts were copied over, with the exception of a few random ones that seem to be missing, but the vast majority made it.\n\nA: I had to transfer from Mojave to Monterey, and here is how I imported my iTunes library into the now called Music. It lets you keep all info on songs, including play count and date added.\n\n*\n\n*Transfer all your actual music files, depending of where you decided to store them, and if possible, keep the folders in the same locations on the new computer.\n\n*Make sure you have a copy of the old library on the new computer. It should be called \"iTunes Library.itl\", and can be found in ~/Music/iTunes.\n\n*Hold the Option (alt) key down and open Music. This will ask you to select a library file.\n\n*Find your library itl file in the prompt.\n\nYour entire library, including playlists, should be restored as is. If you see a lot of \"not found\" songs with a \"!\" sign next to them, then it means you may have audio files missing, or misplaced. If you try to play a missing song, you will be asked if you want to locate it on your hard drive.\n", "Q: Can I trigger a Shortcut from bash in macOS Monterey?

This doesn’t happen when stopping the recording by clicking the on screen stop button.\n\nI then added Spotify using the same process, with the same keyboard combination.  Spotify will only play when the QT apps are disabled in System Preferences.\nI realise my approach is flawed, but I’m not sure if there is a way to achieve this.

To get these possibilities out of the way at the start:\n\n*\n\n*I'm not referring to a macOS installer (I can do that), but a full macOS with a Finder, etc.\n\n*I'm specifically referring to a thumb drive (I can do this to an external SSD, but they don't fit in my pocket).\n\n*I know I use do target disk mode insteal, but that's not always convenient (see fit a Mac in my pocket).\n\n*Booting from external drives is completely enabled for the T2 macs I've worked on for trying this (again, it works on the external SSD).\n\n*Multiple drives, multiple sizes, multiple model Macs\n\n*Catalina and Big Sur both have this issue\n\n*Most of the machines I've used have never been in Jamf\n\nHere is the setup and my problem: I work on Macs frequently, and occasionally they won't boot. In the last few years, I've used an external boot volume running macOS Mojave to fix machines when this happens. The latest (and last) Intel computers can only run Big Sur and Monterey. So I need to update my thumb drive. When I do this, I start installing macOS to an external volume, I select an external thumb drive that is large enough (64, 128, and 256G drives tested) and formatted for one APFS volume. The installer reboots as expected.\nIf it's a T2 Mac, the installer continues to the black apple boot screen, but eventually gets in a crash screen loop. If it's a non-T2 mac, it hangs on the black boot screen when the progress bar is half way, even left for a literal week.\nAgain, this process works for an external SSD, so the process is sound.\nThe question:\nWhat would make the thumb drive act different than external USB drives to cause the failure to complete the installation and can anything be done about it?\n\nA: Not a true answer, but I'm putting this here for anyone looking for info on this situation.\nThe best I've been able to do is with Carbon Copy Cloner, but it will fail to correctly clone multiple times, so it's a bit of a slog to get through. I've had the most luck with removing the partitions using my linux box\nchange the drive letter top match yours, as there's no confirmation in this script\necho 'label: mbr' | sudo  sfdisk /dev/sdc && echo 'label:gpt' | sudo  sfdisk /dev/sdc && sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc\n\nPlug the drive into the Mac and erase it APFS with Disk Utility.\nClone with CCC (Legacy boot assistant).\nIt's still a \"sometimes fails\" situation, so YMMMV (I have one drive that I've given up on). I've managed to get 4 drives working, so that should do for now.\n", "Q: How do I turn off the Magic Keyboard (A1644)? I have the Apple Magic Keyboard model A1644, which was released in 2015:\n\n\n\nBoth this and the Magic Trackpad 2 have switches that allow you to turn it on (green) or off (white). I find that the switch on the trackpad works just fine. However, oftentimes when I try to turn off my keyboard and put it in my bag, I'll find out that the keyboard was on the entire time and draining my computer's battery due to random keystrokes being tapped. It's as though the hardware switch is broken or not respected by the keyboard.\nIs there any way to shut off this keyboard and ensure it's shut off?\n\nA: I've tried several instances of the A1644 keyboard, and the hardware switch seems to be inherently spotty. Unlike with the trackpad--where you can be confident that when you see it in the off (white) position, it's actually off--you have no such assurances with the keyboard. You must verify that it was actually shut off.\nThe process typically involves:\n\n*\n\n*Turn the switch to the off position.\nYou'll see a notification saying the keyboard was disconnected, however, you can't always trust this.\n\n\n*Start typing on the keyboard.\nIf the keyboard wasn't fully shut off, this is when you'll see a notification saying the keyboard was connected again, meaning it wasn't fully shut off.\n\n\n*Repeat the process until it's actually turned off.\nTips:\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes moving the switch all the way to the left (off position) is never going to shut off your keyboard. Instead, you need to move it all the way to the left (100% off), and then move it a tiny bit back to the right, so that it's in the 90% off position. Again you should test it before throwing it back in your bag due to the flakiness of the switch.\n\n", "Q: Is there an app that can send yourself notifications regularly?

By default the volumes are named Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data.\nThe way disks/volumes/partitions/etc work on Mac OS or any UNIX system is you \"mount\" the volume to a path in the filesystem. Macintosh HD is \"mounted\" at the path /. And Macintosh HD - Data is mounted at the path /System/Volumes/Data.\nThe Macintosh HD (or /) volume is mounted as read only and it can only be modified while installing an operating system update. There's no sudo or privilege escalation - think of it as a CD-ROM (with a few exceptions).\nIt gets a little bit messy, for example /Applications exists both at that path and at /System/Volumes/Data/Applications. The latter is the real path, the former is a convenience and also exists for backwards compatibility.\nMost of this is invisible with ordinary usage of a Mac, but you can bump into it while working in the command line.\n\nHow do I prevent other stuff installing into the 'wrong' directory?\n\nBecause / is read only, nothing can be installed there, so you're all good. :-) Everything you install will be under /System/Volumes/Data or a path that points to that.\n\nA: The instructions you're using are for zsh installations made by Homebrew - not the zsh installation that comes with macOS. This is why the paths are different. You can install zsh from Homebrew and then the instructions will be valid.\nAnd yes, in some sense you have hit another \"protection system\", if you want to call it that. The file system you're trying to modify is simply mounted read-only, meaning that it cannot be modified. It is possible to get read-write accesss to these files and make modifications - however I would strongly discourage you from doing so. It is almost certain to give you more problems in the long run.\n", "Q: Does MacBook Air 2012 WiFi support two spatial streams?

Why don’t free apps on the app store have a “Thank You” button where people can say thank you or send you a tip so freeware developers don’t starve to death?\nYoutube has this feature on some but not all of their channels.\n\nA: Most freeware developers are not starving to death - they have well paid jobs, and make apps as a hobby in their spare time.\nThe complexities of receiving payment (e.g. hiring an accountant so you don't violate some unknown tax law) are often not worth it. Time spent figuring all of that out is time the developer would rather spend making their free app better.\nI like to think of it the same as music. Some people get paid to pay music, and some people play music for fun.\n\nA: They do, the Onion Browser have three IAP that are simply for tipping the dev. It's simply more hassle to ensure the app doesn't run afoul of the AppStore strict IAP rulings, compared to just putting a link to the developer site/blog where they might share a donation link.\n\nA: It's very much up to the developer to implement the In-App Purchase (IAP). Some apps do have ways to make IAPs that give developer the tip, and the user doesn't get any extra features.\nSome apps are free and make money by advertisements or selling user data.\nAs for thank you, I'd guess a good review would improve their visibility on the App Store, so that's what I've been doing.\n\nA: Another reason not yet mentioned is taxes. Depending on the jurisdiction(s) you're operating in, you may need to file tax returns on even ridiculously small amounts of income from such tips, and it's probably not worth the time and effort putting up with that for the little you've left afterwards.\nE.g. were I to make an app and put in such a feature, I'd have to pay 50% or so of everything that comes in in taxes to my government, after already paying 30% to Apple. I'd also have to register as a business with the chamber of commerce which carries recurring fees and costs more time. Then there's the corporate bank account I'd need to separate that money from my private funds as it'd now be company money.

LINES is one of the variables with a conventional meaning. Its meaning is to convey the number of lines in a terminal. There is a similar variable COLUMNS.\nOne of the jobs of an interactive shell is to update these two variables when the terminal is resized. Both bash and zsh do this. Even in bash, while LINES=$(…) does work, the value will be overwritten if you resize the terminal.\nIn zsh, additionally, LINES and COLUMNS are declared as integer variables (which makes perfect sense given their purpose). So if you try to assign to them, the string that you assign is interpreted as an arithmetic expression, hence the error if you try to assign a string that isn't a valid arithmetic expression. You can see that the variable is declared as an integer with typeset:\n% typeset -p LINES\ntypeset -i10 LINES=25\n\n-i indicates an integer variable, 10 forces it to be represented in base 10 (which is the default anyway).\nDon't use variables whose names are used by your shell, such as PATH, LINES, PS1, etc. Unfortunately, there's no namespace for shell or environment variables: you have to share. The zsh manual lists the variables that zsh sets and the variables that zsh uses if the user sets them. The bash manual has a list of variables that it uses or sets.\nThere is a widespread convention that environment variables and variables that have some meaning to the shell are in all uppercase. But zsh also uses some all-lowercase variables.\n", "Q: AE/AF lock on iPhone - turn off display? I'm using an iPhone as a camera source via USB to record video using Quicktime on my Macbook.  I want to use AE/AF Lock, but when I do, the recorded video will show the yellow square and AE/AF lock message.  The only way to disable it is to unlock AE/AF.\nDoes anyone know of a way to keep it locked, without displaying the message and square on screen?\nThanks\n\nA: I solved my problem by using an app called OBS camera in combination with OBS studio.  It has many manual settings which override the regular phone camera, and also lets you easily set up multiple ios cameras.  It even has a web-based remote control feature.\nSo I set me AE/AF manually and this stops the autofocus from appearing in the video.\nI'm sure there must be other camera apps that do similar things.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro (2010) beeps 3 times and not starting up I love this Macbook and I know its still in good condition. 3 beeps on start up and keeps beeping 3 times.

You can then replace it with a new/working stick or upgrade. While different brands may work it is rather unlikely and one should always use the exact same memory model (watch LTT's video about it).\nDepending on the workload you may experience performance improvements by upgrading to faster and/or more RAM.\n", "Q: Reopen Last Closed Tab on Mac in Safari v15.1 (Monterey) I used to use CMD + Z to reopen a recently closed tab. From what I can tell - this feature has been removed from Safari at some point. Now seemingly the only option is CMD+SHIFT+T which exclusively reopens the last closed window. Is there any way to natively reopen last closed tab in Safari?\n\nA: This isn't a new feature. Cmd/Z is a kind of 'smart' undo [& also universal to all apps & indeed all platforms]\nCmd/Shift/T is a specific command [though it does change between Tab & Window depending on what was last closed.] It's located in the History menu rather than Edit.\nTo test -\nStart to type an answer or comment into this page.

External displays not identifying correctly So, I just decided to get a KVM because switching inputs was annoying for my work at home setup. The issue I'm running into though is that the macbook doesn't identify my 2 external displays correctly on connect. It requires a reboot for them to identify correctly.\nWhen they are identified incorrectly, they come up as \"ITE-FHD\" instead of the \"LG 4k HDR\" identifier they normally show. The resolution is terrible and the colors are completely off.\nAnyone have any advice? I'm mostly a Windows/Linux user, and use the macbook for work as required.\nEdit to add: rebooting the macbook fixes the issue, but this happens anytime it wakes from sleep, which is often when I step away from the desk for a bit.\n\nA: The issues are caused by the KVM switch does not provide full-time EDID emulation/feeding to all connected systems (both your Linux system and MacBook).\nSo, each time you want to make a switch to different connected systems or if the monitor connections are under power saving time-out, you will need to re-boot or replug cables to make re-initial the video bus communications between your shared monitor and connected systems.\nIt's a very command problem with most of the KVM switches not supporting EDID feeding functions.\nFind a DDM-class KVM switch will solve the issues.\n", "Q: Time machine \"Delete all backups of \" option missing Previously, when you right clicked a file in the Time Machine view, you had an option to delete it and all its backed up copies.\n\nI'm using macOS Monterey, and that appears to no longer exist:\n\nWas this feature removed?\n\nA: The ability to delete all backups of a file was removed when Time Machine changed to using destination disks formatted as APFS with Big Sur.\nThis loss of functionality is, in my view, more than compensated by the improved reliability of Time Machine to APFS.\nFor the best in depth articles on Time Machine see the \"Time Machine to APFS\" on the Eclectic Light blog\n", "Q: Music app - half my songs are really quiet, within an album I've just started using a Mcbook Air(Big Sur, 11.5.1, M1 chipset) after being a Linux/Windows user for years.  I brought over my MP3 collection from my old Thinkpad and imported into the Music app.\nFor most albums, the tracks alternate between being normal volume and really quiet.  Like 'I can barely hear it' quiet.  I've tried switching on the Sound Check option in the Preferences, but it doesn't make any difference - it doesn't seem to do anything in fact.\nIf it was that one album was louder than another, I could maybe understand it, but for it to alternate within an album, I just don't understand.  It's not an exact quiet-loud-quiet-loud-quiet-loud alternation btw - sometimes it might go quiet-quiet-loud-quiet-loud-loud for example.  But, it's roughly a 50/50 split.\nIt also doesn't happen with every album - just most albums.\nWhen i listened to them on the old laptop, they were all the same volume (with maybe a slight difference on an album-by-album basis but nothing like this).\nI opened a \"quiet\" one and a loud one in Audacity and the peak db is the same in both, and if I listen to them out of Audacity they sound the same volume.  So the issue is definitely with the playback in the Music app rather than the files themselves, unless there is some metadata Music is reading and adjusting the playback volume accordingly.  If there was, though, i don't know why it would go up and down so much within an album.\nAny ideas anyone?\nEDIT - I downloaded Elmedia player and they all play fine in that - same volume.  I would still prefer to fix them in Music though as it's a nicer interface.\n\nA: This turned out to be due to a setting on the individual MP3s which tells some players to turn them up or down.  I don't know what the technical metadata field in the file is called but within the Music app it's called \"volume adjust\" and can be seen by right clicking on a track, choosing Get Info and then going to the Options tab.\nIn the problem albums, every track was set to either -90% or +100% in this 'volume adjust' setting.  Obviously this setting is ignored in Audacity and Elmedia, the other player app I tried.\nFortunately it's possible to select multiple tracks (eg all tracks by a given artist or even all of your library I suppose), right click and Get Info, then go to the Options tab and set that 'volume adjust' to 0%.\nAs to how they got like that, I don't know.  I have a vague memory of mucking about with a command line utility in linux for adjusting mp3 volumes, 10 or 15 years ago, and I suspect it was that which set these ridiculous volume adjust settings, which all the players I've been using have ignored, until now.\n", "Q: How do I use Spaces to \"save\" a specific browser page on restart? Let's say I'd like gmail.com open on my Desktop 1, and yahoo.com open on my Desktop 2 on a computer restart. Is this possible with Mac Spaces + some browser settings?\n\nA: Seems like the latest Mac OS X (Monterey) does support this for my needs!\nI'm not sure if this setting is still needed (found on an older thread):\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome NSWindowRestoresWorkspaceAtLaunch -bool YES\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled all of the checked options under Mission Control.\n\n*Set up each space with its own Google Chrome with the website I want\n\n*On restart, keep the checked option for the Mac to reopen the same windows\n\nNote: this worked for Preview as well - I have a document open to the second chapter on my 3rd Screen and successive restarts kept its place!\n", "Q: MacOS Notifications Not Working with Multi-Monitor after Monterey Update I upgraded my Mac to Monterey a handful of weeks back and ever since then my notifications are not showing on-screen.

When checking the \"When mirroring or sharing the display\", however, notifications came back. The problem is, I'm not mirroring nor sharing my display. I'm plugged into my multi-monitor setup.

Need help to get it back I backed up whole drive with CCC first, but booting from that does not seem to finish loading. Starting up from a USB Mojave installer (which I have used before) I reformatted to HFS extended and then back to APFS. I did not use the convert function to go back to APFS. Then I used the USB Mojave Installer successfully but it only shows Macintosh HD at the top level but not a Container with HD and HD-Data volumes. Apple Store person said I could use Mojave or Catalina installer, which I also have, to erase either the container or the whole drive. But I am reluctant to experiment further without more confirming advice.\n\nA: Correct.  Mojave does not create a container with multiple volumes.  Mojave has a container with a single volume.  Everything is as it should be.  Boot your USB installer, create a single HFS volume, install Mojave.  Allow it to migrate to APFS as a part of installing the OS.  Now, restore your data.\n", "Q: When my computer boots or restarts, I see ghosts! These days, when I power-on my MacBook Pro computer, I do not see a blank display.  No... I see \"ghosts\" of the icons that were on the toolbar of my latest reboot.  Most recently, I've even seen \"ghosts\" of my most recent website display ... just before my latest \"unexpected reboot.\"  Yes, when I look at \"the desktop,\" I see them there.  Of course I have utterly no idea why the desktop graphic display of my desktop should have any sort of \"memory,\" but lately here it is.\nThe graphics displays, as of late, have also become quite inexplicable: why should I see the ghostly remnants of the taskbar, even before my computer asks me to log in?  And then, having logged in, why should I see the ghostly remnants of a previous web page that I have visited, superimposed upon my Finder screen?\n\nA: Without seeing a photo or video of the phenomenon you're describing, two possibilities come to mind:\n\n*\n\n*You may be seeing LCD image persistence, or \"burn in\", which is a parasitic behavior in liquid crystal displays that can occur when a static image, particularly at high brightness levels, remains on the screen for an extended period of time. Older displays are more likely to experience this. For example: \n\n*You might be seeing the unhibernation process taking place. In order to enter hibernation, macOS writes all contents of memory onto disk before shutting off power to almost every part of the computer. In order to wake from hibernation, the prior memory contents have to be restored from disk, which takes time. To show the user that the machine is working, system firmware draws a progress bar along with a grayscale image of the screen as it looked before entering sleep. It looks like this: \nSo does your Mac look like either of those? Can you show us a photo or video?\n", "Q: Macs on local network no longer appear in Network or Finder Sidebar for Screen Sharing I have a Mac Mini and MacBook connected within my local network.

I have restarted both Macs multiple times.\n\nI can also not connect directly to them with the Screen Sharing app. Typing the computer's name in the Connect To: results in the error:\n\nUnable to resolve “MacName.local”\nVerify the name you entered and make sure your network connection is working.\n\nFinder > Go > Connect to Server... similarly does not list any local Macs. Pressing + does strangely (re)add a shortcut to the Mac, which I've connected to before.

Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and then try again.\n\nIn modern macOS, Big Sur or Monterey or newer, how can I reset this situation and see local network Macs in the Finder sidebar?\nThe solutions offered in a similar previous question no longer seem to apply in modern macOS.

(instead of opening it in a new browser tab)\nThe closest behavior I get is when I ask to download the file, Safari is set to immediately open it in Preview. However what I would like to achieve is that instead of haveing to load it first in the browser and press on download (or alternatively having to right-click and chose \"Download Linked File\") I would be able to simply click on the link of the PDF and automatically open it in Preview.\nThanks!\n\nA: There's no mechanism for opening a link directly into Preview that I know of.\nHowever, once the PDF is being viewed in Safari, you can open it in Preview by clicking on the third-from-left icon in the floating menu that appears when you mouse over an area at the bottom of the Safari window.\n\nSome PDFs may download rather than display in the browser, but that's an issue at the server-side, rather than something you can configure at your end.\n", "Q: I've just upgraded to Monterey on my MacBook Air 2020 and now I can't play music through my bluetooth Samsung soundbar anymore I was able to just fine before the upgrade. I reset the connections on both devices, restarted a few times, restarted bluetooth, but no dice. Anybody else has this problem as well?\nI did read that this was a problem with the early betas, but got patched out- and it seems to be back right now.\nPossibly related, but my iOS 15 device also stopped connecting to my Samsung hardware directly after the update. I did reinstall the firmware on my soundbar, but no luck. I also tried connecting to it via some other devices that I own that support bluetooth audio and they work without a hitch, so it does seem to be related to MacOS and iOS.\n\nA: I just had the same problem and I fixed it by first forgetting the soundbar on my macbook then repairing to it. I had to click the pair button on the sound bar remote for that.

It would keep rebooting itself during start up (the progress bar never completes).  In the end it would give me an error saying to go to \"support.apple.com/mac/restore.\"  In other words, please do not use the \"xartutil\" function with an M1 Mac!\nTo fix the problem, I had to put the computer into DFU mode first and then do a \"Restore\" to fix the problem. I tried \"Revive\" first but that didn't work.  Make sure that the words \"DFU\" shows up on Apple Configurator before you try to \"Restore\" or it will fail. It is probably easiest to watch a YouTube video on how to put the computer into DFU mode as it's not straight forward.

Worse, I can no longer even log into the Mac.\nTo resolve the problem I began with the accepted answer described by David Rouse in response to a similar question - Renamed /etc folder. I can't login anymore - asked in 2019.\nThe first part of that solution (booting the Mac using Single User Mode with the existing password and running mount -uw) works perfectly.\nHowever, even from Single User Mode I am unable to rename the /etc directory. For instance, attempting to run cd or mv in relation to /etc results in a No such file or directory message, and the symlink /private folder appears to be empty - see image below.\nSo how can I change the folder name back to /etc so that the Mac becomes operational again?\n\n\nA: I have Monterey installed in a VMware Fusion Player virtual machine.\nI followed your instructions and was able to rename /private/etc to /private/xetc.\nWhen I boot Monterey in single user mode, I see the following output. The image shows instructions in the form of three three commands, which can be used to mount the data partition on an SEP-enabled device.\n\nNote: For a beter view of the image, click on the image or open the image in a new window.\n\n\nBelow is the output from the mount command. Only the sealed, read-only volume is mounted on /. This is why the /private folder is empty.\n\nSo, I followed the instructions shown in the first image and entered the following commands.\n\nNote: These commands produced messages, which I chose to ignore.\n\n/sbin/mount -P 1\n/usr/libexec/init_data_protection\n/sbin/mount -P 2\n\nBelow is the output from the mount command. Now, the Data volume is mount on /System/Volumes/Data.\n\nSince this Data volume was tagged with the data role metadata flag when created and is in the same APFS Volume Group as the initially mounted volume, both volumes share the root (/) mount point. In other words, this Data volume is mounted twice.\n\n\nNext, I made the repair by entering the following command.\nmv /private/xetc /private/etc\n\n\nNote: I could have also made the same repair by entering the longer version given below.\n\nmv /System/Volumes/Data/private/xetc /System/Volumes/Data/private/etc\n\nFinally, I entered the command below to boot to Monterey.\nexit\n\n \n", "Q: How to zoom to make a window take all the space on screen? I've got a Finder window and I want to Maximize it. But when I click the Zoom button (green button on the top-left side of the window) while pressing the Option key, it just does a little bit of zooming, it doesn't do what I call \"maximize\", which is to take the whole screen. Here's a demo:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nvxKWgF.mp4\nAny way to \"maximize\", the same way we \"maximize\" on Windows systems?\n\nA: Hold the Option key and double-click on any corner of the window. That will do what you want.\nWhen you double-click on an edge of a window it will snap to the edge of the screen. Do that with the corner and the corner snaps to the corner of the screen. Holding option will do it with the current edge or corner and the opposite one. So Option+double clicking any corner will snap that corner and the opposite corner to the corners of the screen, making the window fill the screen without going into Full Screen mode.\n\nA: When i click the green button, without any modifier keys, it expands the active window to fill the screen, hiding the top menu bar.\nIf I use Option and click the button it maximises but keeps the top menu visible.\n", "Q: Where did setting the background color in Pages go?

Is background color now just considered a special case of either? (and do these variations continue to be accepted by ms-word?)\n\nA: I see it now. It's been relegated to Advanced Options. Weird. This means that if I'm editing some writing and want to make sure my comments are clearly visible, by changing their background, I need to click three times to do it (after marking the text).\nVerdict\nAtrocious usability in v11.2.

Update: I am not going to delete the question although it is useless.  The answer is, Yes, it would be a bug, but zsh doesn’t do that.  I screwed up writing the details.  A quarantined script can be edited with vi in zsh but it cannot be executed. Since a more detailed answer was provided (even though we allegedly cannot answer a closed question), I’ll leave it up for reference.\nBackground:\nI have several zsh scripts in ~/bin and I have often edited them with TextEdit.\nToday, however, every time I edit one with TextEdit and save it, TextEdit can no longer open it again—would claim it was damaged and should be moved to the trash.\nod -xc showed no non-ASCII characters.\nls -lae@t showed that it had a quarantine tag!\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine bin said \"xattr: bin/Mission: No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine\" and removed all the xattrs¹ and then TextEdit was able to open it.\nNote that someone else had the opposite behavior: TextEdit could still open it, but they could no longer execute the file.\nFor TextEdit to suddenly start doing this when nothing has been updated for over a week (except iMovie) is clearly a bug.  But is it a bug for zsh to still execute a quarantined script?  This is not an opinion question.  Apple probably has documentation somewhere describing what should happen.  If they don't, and someone knows they don't, then that is the answer.  If they do, what that documentation (that I haven't seen) says is the answer.\nWhen one person is able to run a quarantined script, and another is not, there is a bug on one side or another.\n¹including the encoding, not that it matters for this script.\n\nA: This answer pertains to macOS Monterey 12.0.1.\nIt is not a bug for zsh to execute a quarantined script. Below explains why I believe this to be true.\nThe issues raised in the OP's question are to do with the content of the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute and not necesarily to the existence of the attribute itself.\nThe TextEdit application is adding a com.apple.quarantine extended attribute when saving edited script files. My example script file named bar is shown below.\n#!/bin/zsh\necho \"hi there\"\n\n\nThe content of this com.apple.quarantine extended attribute is given below.\n0086;6198914d;TextEdit;\n\nThe article Quarantine and the quarantine flag refers to the first for characters (0086) as the quarantine value in hexadecimal. The 6198914d character string is the time at which the extended attribute was attached, in hexadecimal.  After some testing, I determined the script will not execute (from the default zsh) with an zsh: operation not permitted: bar message when the 0x0004 bit is set. Otherwise, the script will execute. Since the 0x0004 bit is set in the quarantine value of 0x0086, the script is prevented from executing.\nWhen using Safari to download a file from the internet, a com.apple.quarantine extended attribute is attached to the file. Example content of this com.apple.quarantine extended attribute is given below.\n0083;61991274;Safari;773A774E-C8E8-41A4-8EC3-AF0E00656893\n\nHere, the 0x0004 bit is not set in the quarantine value of 0x0083. This com.apple.quarantine extended attribute will not prevent a script from executing.\nRegarding the Use of TextEdit\nYou can open the script in the TextEdit application, if any of the 0xFF40 bits are set. Otherwise, you get the following popup, if the 0x0004 bit is set.\n\nAny other combination results in the following popup.\n\nOf course, I did not try every 65536 possible integers for the quarantine value. Therefore, there may exist exceptions to what I posted above.\n", "Q: Migrate OS to new SSD without upgrade? I bought a new SSD for my Macbook Pro early 2015 and tried to migrate to it yesterday.

Hopefully someone can point me in a very specific direction.\nProblem: I have data on two SSD drives that I used using Apple RAID 0 on a 2011 MacBook. This setup worked GREAT until my motherboard fried a few weeks back. All I want to do is grab the data off the drives and then sell the drives. That's my sole objective. I have a 1tb bootable external thunderbolt drive I used for backups (using CCC) but I added some data since then and would like to grab it.\nThe only other Mac I have is an older MacBook5,1. This is probably the crux if my problem because this POS won't boot anything properly. When I install the sata drives it will boot using single user mode, but that's useless for CCC. If I try to boot normally it will crash at the login screen. If I try to boot with shift I get the do not enter sign (no boot volume?). If I try to boot the backup (via USB because this older Mac has no thunderbolt) it gives the do not enter sign. I found a Mohave USB install stick and can boot that (the only thing I've found that boots thus far), but nothing I install the OS on will boot. Not if I install on an external drive, not if I install on another USB stick, etc. I tried running CCC via the terminal while booted to that install disk but that didn't run. I tried making a High Sierra USB install stick using Windows twice using two different source DMGs and two different sticks. One failed to boot and the other, although had a file system with the installer, wasn't even blessed (and I cannot find any info online which folder I'm supposed to bless on an installer USB stick, not that I have particularly high hopes that would help).\nYes, I have zapped PR RAM.\nYes, I know Mojave isn't officially supported on this MacBook. This appears to be a compatibility version (dosdude?). The data is on an APFS drive so if I got High Sierra installed I think Paragon has a driver, however I honestly don't think Mojave was the problem and getting a High Sierra installer to boot has proven a major hurdle.\nI'm a dev who has used Macs since 1986 and have never had such trouble before. Maybe there is a command line app that can do the clone from single user mode? No, dd isn't a solution.\nI'm really at a loss what to try next!\n\nA: Closing this as I finally found some random solution. Kept trying random disks until I found a Yosemite drive that would boot. There is no backport of apfs so I made a NEW dosdude Mojave installer and this one worked somehow (not sure why).\nAll disks now mounted.

The successor to macOS Catalina is macOS Big Sur, which supports the Pro Macs that date back to 2013.\nIf you have a 2012 or earlier model when writing software for 2022, it does seem reasonable to think about upgrading the hardware.\nIf you haven't got the option of upgrading your hardware, you could look into one of the various patchers available that makes it possible to install Big Sur on even older hardware. As a developer, I wouldn't advise doing so though, as you can't really be sure if issues you run into are caused by your unsupported setup or bugs in your code.\nAnother possibility is to run Big Sur in a virtual machine on your Catalina Mac. That doesn't require any patchers, but comes with it own set of drawbacks. Most notably, on a 10 year old Mac it will probably be a bit slow.\nYes, various Xcode version requires various operating system versions. The reasoning here is that if you're writing software that requires new OS feature, then the developer needs to be running such a new operating system in order to actually run the software.\nFor professional software developers in most parts of the world, a cost of a few thousand dollars in hardware depreciated over 10 years is really not a big deal. I.e.\nFinally, no it is not so that getting menus to work requires you to spend thousands of dollars on hardware. Only getting menus to work using that one specific method requires you to have Big Sur. You can get menus working in Swift applications in many other ways that won't require Big Sur. Note that you have lots of applications running on Catalina (and older) that have menus - so it's not impossible.\n", "Q: Mac Mail search not working after updating to Big Sur I've recently updated from macOS 10.15 to Big Sur.\nGenerally everything works, apart from the search tool in macOS's native Mail.app: when I try to search for an email, phrase, contact etc, half the time i get 0 results, or the search query does not impact the results eg nothing changes / is search for.\nIve got multiple email accounts setup in mac mail.

On macOS Big Sur, it will be ~/Library/Mail/V8/MailData. From Finder > Go to folder, enter ~Library/Mail/V7/MailData or ~/Library/Mail/V8/MailData.

I've run NMAP several times on my home network in my campaign of learning the basics of network security.\nSo far all my devices except my PC have been Iphones/Chromebooks so nothing has been found in the way of open ports and so on (Apart from a few clear ones i.e 443/80).\nHowever, runnining Nmap today I've found these ports randomly opened on the macaddress + Ip address associated with an Iphone 6(IOS V.12.56) I have at home.\n\n*\n\n*1062/tcp filtered veracity\n\n*1088/tcp filtered cplscrambler-al\n\n*1105/tcp filtered ftranhc\n\n*1217/tcp filtered hpss-ndapi\n\n*2002/tcp filtered globe\n\n*2006/tcp filtered invokator\n\n*2323/tcp filtered 3d-nfsd\n\n*4443/tcp filtered pharos\n\n*5102/tcp filtered admeng\n\n*6101/tcp filtered backupexec\n\n*6346/tcp filtered gnutella\n\n*7103/tcp filtered unknown\n\n*18101/tcp filtered unknown\n\n*26214/tcp filtered unknown\n\n*44443/tcp filtered coldfusion-auth\n\nHighly confused and wondering if anyone recognizes these ports for Iphone. Off the bat I see things like Gnutella and coldfusion, to name a few. Highly boggling.\nIs it the case that Iphone has these specific ports configured. If so, why are they configured if anyone knows?

This is as it should be.\nWhy nmap is listing them like this at all depends on the arguments you have passed to nmap, AFAIK.\nBy contrast, the two other states are:\n\n*\n\n*\"open\": With TCP, a SYN packet got at least an ACK answer back. That is, the other side answers a connection request.\n\n*\"closed\": An attempt to send a packet to that port was answered with an ICMP message informing the sender that the recipient is not accepting connections on this port.\n\nWith active firewall, you should see all ports as \"filtered\" and only those with an active (public) service as \"open\". You rarely see \"closed\", I think it's unlikely you're going to see it on an iPhone at all.\n", "Q: Install new LaTeX packages in Keynote, Pages I was trying to make a presentation in Keynote since it had a direct LaTeX equation writer embedded.

About once a day, the phone becomes really slow, to the point of being unusable. This lasts about thirty seconds. During this time, the phone heats up quite a bit, and the battery drains a lot faster than normal. It often happens while opening the app menu (double click home button) or after exiting Safari.\nIn addition to this problem, my phone's battery drains really fast when using certain apps. When browsing Safari, my phone can lose 5-10% in a minute.\nAnother example of this is when recording video. The phone's battery drains ridiculously fast (just like above) and the phone often gets hot to the point where the flash becomes unavailable.\nA final example is the DJI Fly app. When flying my drone and connected to the controller, I get at most 30-45 minutes of time before my phone drops from 100% to 10%. The phone also heats up quite a bit during this time.\nI checked the battery health - it still has plenty left, 67%.\nSafari has no tabs open.\nAttempted troubleshooting:\n\n*\n\n*Turned off Bluetooth and WiFi - No effect\n\n*Turned on Low Power Mode - No effect, battery sometimes drains faster\n\n*Turned down screen brightness - Slight effect, not much\n\n*Turned off Location - The battery lasts about twice as long while using the phone normally, but does not affect the rapid overheat/drain while using certain apps.\n\n*Restarted the phone - The phone dropped 15% while restarting, no effect afterward\n\n*Charging the phone - The phone doesn't heat up as much, and the battery lasts longer. Some apps still drain the battery faster than it can charge, and the percentage goes down anyway.\n\n\nA: I have seen phones that need a restore on occasion. I would do that and when you sign in - do not restore any backup. I also would not install any third party apps, sign in to any cloud accounts and just use Safari for an hour to see if you feel it’s substantially better with a clean restore.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184\nErase all contents is not sufficient - you will want to connect to a computer and restore it.

The menu command is not the top level menu name, its what's under the top level menu name that are commands Please have a look at: Create keyboard shortcuts for apps on Mac\nThat said, this is not even the right place to create a keyboard shortcut that opens an application. As an example, you can create a Quick Action/Service in Automator and open an application, then assign it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, not: ... App Shortcuts\nThere are several third-party application that keyboard shortcuts can be assigned to programmed actions and any one of them may be better than using an Automator Quick Action/Service. For example I use FastScripts and Hammerspoon to assign keyboard shortcuts that in turn when pressed run AppleScript scripts, shell scripts, Lua code, etc. to accomplish all sorts of tasks. For example, in FastScripts I press F6 to empty the Trash without prompting. This is because the F6 key is not assigned to anything else on my system, so with nothing to conflict with it, it just works.\nFWIW Using a single key as a keyboard shortcut can be problematic and generally speaking (IMO) should not be done. Also, depending on other system preferences pressing the fn key may also be necessary, as by default pressing F1 adjusts the brightness of the screen.\nIf you keep the Mail icon in the Dock you can a open it with a single-click vs. a single-keypress.\n\nAs previously mentioned about other system preferences, in e.g. macOS Catalina in System Preferences > Keyboard one must check the [√] Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys checkbox to use the function keys as standard function keys and with that checked and with the following snippet of Lua code in Hammerspoon it opens Mail, or if its already open it focuses it. Otherwise I'd also have to press fn with F1:\nhs.hotkey.bind({}, \"f1\", function()\n    hs.application.launchOrFocus(\"Mail\") \nend)\n\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with the developers of the aforementioned third-party applications, just a satisfied user of the products.\n", "Q: Can I test a replacement iPhone I bought at auction for carrier compatibility by inserting the SIM without screwing up my existing account?

Is that possible to do by inserting a SIM the carrier sent me?\n\nA: I believe Verizon in the US keeps their gates shut and you need their help to activate devices.

I recently had to reinstall the developer tools using xcode-select —install, but noticed that the install was completed with my efficiency cores rather than my performance cores. I know this because iStatMenu showed me that my four efficiency cores were at 100% most of the time while the performance cores were inactive.\nIs there a way I can manually set the priority of a process? Can I tell a process to run on the performance cores if needed? Ideally, it would actually use as many cores as it had threads, and run on all 8 cores simultaneously.\nAn answer here describes how to run a task with the efficiency cores, which is equally useful, but I couldn't figure out how to adapt that technique to use the performance cores instead.\n\nA: You should note that the linked to answer works by \"clamping\" the QoS setting for the program - i.e. effectively putting a limit on how \"well\" thr program should be treated by the system.\nThis question is actually the opposite that we want to put a limit on how \"bad\" the program could be treated by the system.\nI.e. even if xcode-select --install actually asks for the performance cores, it could under normal circumstances still be forced to run on efficiency cores if the performance cores are used for other things.\nI would recommend starting by using taskinfo to gain information about the specific program. I.e. start up the installation process and run the following command in the Terminal:\nsudo taskinfo 1234\n\nwhere 1234 is the PID of the xcode-select process, you have started.\nThis will let you know a lot of useful information about the process, in particular you can see which scheduling policy is being used, the QoS clamp, and the latency and thruput QoS settings. Note that these values are shown first as the \"requested policy\" and then again as the \"effective policy\".\nDepending on your system setup, I would assume that you find the reason for running on efficiency cores in the output. Then use the taskpolicy command to set a new through tier with the -t option or a new latency tier with the l option. You can also use the nice command to alter the scheduling priority.\n", "Q: Does a service exist to open selected filename from the Terminal in an app?

Hello I've noticed that volume control acts differently on the internal speakers vs internal speakers.\nPrimarily the fact that the built in audio uses some sort of multiband compression or volume dependent - dynamic equalization and other DSP modifications (I'm guessing a slight reverb as well)? The volume control seems to control dynamics at the lower levels and keeps the frequency response relatively balanced for all volume levels for human speech (preventing overall muddiness or overwhelming sibilance) at the expense of dynamics,\nWhereas the external output sends the pure signal and the volume control modifies the gain. A lot of youtube and video content is either poorly mastered and consequently suffer from a lot of boominess, and sudden loud noises, and sibilance. Which are pretty bad when using headphones or nice external speakers.\nConsequently I was wondering if there were a way to keep the CoreAudio running? Either by spoofing the internal speakers through the headphone jack or software solutions.

I had that random config file on the old laptop, let me grab that!\" I am not expecting to run apps that were installed on the old one, but just being able to look at the Applications directory would be useful as a reminder, as would the contents of /usr/local (for Homebrew), and the dotfiles in ~, etc. What I don't trust is my ability to remember everything I'll ever want right now. So I want to grab it all and be able to go diffing when I need it.\nI'm looking for recommendations on how to do this, and tradeoffs for various methods. I really would like the whole volume.\n\nA: The two most frequently recommended tools for creating images on macs are:\nSuperDuper: https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper\nCarbonCopyCloner: https://bombich.com/\nBoth will image the mac and convert it to a single image file you can store.\nYou could also just connect the two machines and put the old one in Target Disk Mode: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-mac-computers-target-disk-mode-mchlp1443/mac\nThen you can copy the files off, or generate an image. Disk Utility can generate an image from a folder, so you could select the drive on the old mac and image it.\n", "Q: WindowServer high on Macbook M1 Pro My WindowServer usage seems unusually high. I only have two chrome tabs open. I have a Macbook M1 Pro running Monterey.\n\n\nA: I'm going to just casually mention two educated hypotheses in case these are easy answers, and then follow them with a scientific problem-solving strategy.\n\n*\n\n*Monterey is a new major OS release and these always have bugs. You may be experiencing one such issue that will have to wait for an OS update for a fix.\n\n*Chrome is a well-known cause of general system slowness for a number of technical reasons. Even though it is lightly loaded on your machine, it may still be indirectly inducing high CPU utilization in WindowServer. (Perhaps, for instance, due to usage of deprecated API or SPI that bypass standard, performance-optimized frameworks and libraries.) Try rebooting and using your machine without ever opening Chrome.\n\nIf neither of those are helpful, then let's get on with a rigorous investigation. An important first step when trying to narrow down the cause of performance issues is to capture a spindump during the slow period. This will allow us to get a sense of where CPU time is being spent. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet:\n sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n\n*Perform an operation that you know will be abnormally slow.\n\n\n*As soon as you begin to feel the slowness, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. We can take a look at it and come up with next steps for the investigation.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro suddenly slows down with high CPU load After a sudden power cut, my Macbook Pro became so slow and laggy with high CPU load.\n\nThe CPU load is very high on startup and whenever I open an app. Even a small app like Notes also causes more than 100% CPU load.\nI have checked the fan, repaired the disk, reset VRAM, reset SMC... but the issue still persists.\nAny ideas? Before the sudden power cut accident, my Macbook Pro run pretty fast.\n\nA: After trying everything you've tried above, and after checking whether a Safe Boot resolves the issue, as Jean_JD suggests, the next level of diagnosis when trying to narrow down the cause of performance issues is to capture a spindump during the slow period. This will allow us to get a sense of where CPU time is being spent. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes.

Admin / root permissions are not strong enough to change how the kernel / OS handle files.\nThis protection holds for any file, anywhere - so SIP / permissions and locks just make deletion more complicated - you can test this in a home folder if you want to see this in action on files you create as opposed to ones the system creates.\nThe file that was there will be deleted, but a new one will be created when the system starts.\nYou can test this by checking the node number for the file in question.

I expect holding command and tapping once to also open link in new window. However, doing so does nothing about 90% of the time.\nHowever, if I hold command and DOUBLE tap, then it opens in new window, as if I had single physical-clicked.

I owned a MacBook Pro with an original Apple-certified SSD. I erased my entire disk (using the erase option in disk utility) with TRIM disabled, then reinstalled the Mac OS and enabled it as soon as when I got into the system. Would my previous data still be trimmed?\nModel: MacBook Pro 2017 13\", running Mac Sierra. SSD name: APPLE AP0256J Media\n\nA: First, it is not the data per se that is TRIM'ed - it is the locations where the data is stored seen from the point of view of the operating system.\nIf your computer had been running a more recent version of macOS with APFS boot drive, it would automatically TRIM all unused locations at every boot. However, your computer is running a historic version of macOS that does not have this feature.\nI would highly recommend upgrading your computer to a recent macOS version such as macOS Big Sur or macOS Monterey.\nAs far as I know, the macOS Sierra program for creating a new file system on disk (\"mkfs\") does not TRIM out the data blocks now considered empty.\nAs a quick fix, if you do not want to upgrade macOS, you could create a huge file on your disk taking up all disk space - and then remove that. It would trigger a TRIM of all the now empty locations on disk.\nYou can create such a huge file by running this command in the Terminal:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=hugefile bs=1m\n\nThen the command completes (i.e. the disk runs out of free disk space) - remove the hugefile file.\n", "Q: Error while installing PostgreSQL 12.9 on Apple Silicon (M1 Max) via asdf I'm trying to install PostgreSQL via asdf-postgres plugin by running asdf install postgres 12.9 on 2021 MacBook Pro (with M1 Max, running Monterey 12.0.1) but getting the following error:\n100   190  100   190    0     0    345      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   346\n/Users/kushal/.asdf/plugins/postgres/bin/install: line 45: uconv: command not found\nBuilding with options: --prefix=/Users/kushal/.asdf/installs/postgres/12.9     --with-uuid=e2fs     --with-openssl     --with-zlib     --with-libraries=/opt/local/lib:/sw/lib:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib:/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib     --with-includes=/opt/local/lib:/sw/lib:/usr/local/opt/openssl/include:/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include:/opt/homebrew/include:/usr/local/include:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib --with-uuid=e2fs --with-openssl --with-libraries=/usr/local/lib:/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib --with-includes=/usr/local/include:/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/include\nchecking build system type...

I was able to undelete the macOS Recovery partition so I could boot into Recovery mode though I've been doing most of my work through the net-based Recovery mode (I'll call this net-Recovery) as something I read suggested that would give me the most relevant set of tools for my version of the OS.\nI used TeskDisk (and DiskUtil) to compile a map of my drive.  If I can get the macOS portion running again, I'll probably remove the Bootcamp partition and rebuild it using the proper tools and reinstall Windows altogether, but I want to save the Mac portion if I can.  From what I can tell from information on this and another site I should probably rebuild my partition map using \"gpt\" (I can't use \"gdisk\" since I don't have anyplace to install it that I'm aware of; I'm working on the internal drive).  I've run into an issue getting Suspicious MBR at sector 0.  Even trying to use \"gpt -v destroy -r disk0\" doesn't work because of this.  I get the impression I can use \"fdisk\" to rebuild this?  I think I'm just looking to make sure what I'm planning is right before I mess things up irrevocably.\nWhen I run \"diskutil disk0\" under net-Recovery, I get this:\n0:  FDisk_partition_scheme  500.1GB disk0\n1:  0xEE                    209.7MB disk0s1\n2:  Apple_HFS               370GB   disk0s2\n4:  Windows_NTFS            53.7GB  disk0s4\n\nTestdisk provided the following map:\nEFI System      40          409639      409600\nMac HFS         409640      723065887   722656248\nMac HFS         723065888   724335423   1269536\nMS Data         724336640   829194239   104857600\n\nI'm pretty sure the 2nd Mac HFS is the Recovery partition.

This answer explains how to install gdisk, then give examples of how to use gdisk. Since your drive appears to be hybrid partitioned, the first example shows how to remove the hybrid partitioning. The second example rebuilds your GPT from scratch.\n\nNote: Your drive has a macOS Recovery partition. This partition has a nonzero attribute in the GPT. The gpt command can not set attribute bits in the GPT. Therefore, the gpt command can not be used to completely rebuilt your partition map.

I've been using POP to download Gmail to Mail.app since I made the account in 2009. Now, Google required me to use 2-step authentication, meaning I also can only use IMAP for my Google account on my Mac as the POP account configuration no longer can log in.\nMy emails on Gmail and in the new IMAP account only go back to 2011, so if I only use that account, I will be missing my oldest emails. If I can take the POP mailbox as a starting point, it also won't have to waste space on my Mac with so many duplicate emails. So is there a way to use the old POP mailbox as a starting point, and Mail would know not to re-download those existing emails back into that mailbox, and I would have one single account in Mail.app now on IMAP which has my entire email history?\n\nA: In Mail just drag the emails in the POP account into the folder in Gmail\nThis will copy the emails to the Gmail server and also delete them from your local machine - so make sure you have a backup of your local mail files.\nIf you are unsure just drag one or two emails and see what happens.\n", "Q: Sharing Macbook's WiFi connection to other device via wired connection My MacBook Pro (2017 ver. / no ethernet port) is connected to a WiFi connection and I am trying to use Internet Sharing so that I can connect my Philips Hue Bridge to the internet.

This is detected by power management integrated circuits, which are found at all levels throughout the system and include brownout protection. The PMICs will force a power emergency shutdown rather than risk running the silicon out of spec.\n\n*The SMC, being just another subsystem on the logic board, and being directly powered by the battery, also experiences this brownout -> emergency shutdown cascade. Because there is no backup power to the SMC, it has no way of recording the failure condition in the same manner that it is normally able to record most other failures to provide a nonzero shutdown cause code.\n\n*The reason that this happens without warning at the \"80-90%\" battery charge level is because the battery level is determined by a heuristic algorithm that was built upon empirical, statistical modeling of voltage discharge curves. It is not a direct, real-time measurement of internal battery chemistry. These models are weighted towards newer batteries and they become less and less accurate as the battery ages. For a >5-year-old pack, it's perfectly reasonable to see this kind of sudden shutoff behavior.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro battery cycles is increased I have a MacBook Pro (2019), I usually work at home, so I use the MacBook with connected to energy but that the battery cycles is increased. This is normal? What is the best way to use a Macbook at home, connected to energy or using the battery?\n\nA: Yes, it's normal for the battery cycles to increase even if you are connected to a power supply. Laptops (like MacBooks) discharge and recharge their batteries a bit to increase their lifetime when they're connected to an external power source (citation needed; I've heard this many times but can't find a source for this quickly).\n", "Q: How to tile up to 4 windows in MacOS?

When I upgraded to Monterey yesterday, things started getting icky with Utility apps like System Preferences and Activity Monitor.\nUPDATE 3: Ok, getting some more info from this answer and considering that I just updated from Catalina to Monterey (skipped BigSur), there is a pattern in that only built-in apps are not showing up in Spotlight.

What I wrote in Update 3 and the info from this article: Fixing no Spotlight results on macOS Big Sur led me to the solution:\nthe built-in apps have been moved to /System/Applications starting BigSur (I updated from Catalina to Monterey a day ago). I ran sudo mdutil -sa to find out:\n /:\nIndexing disabled.\n\nSo, I ran: sudo mdutil -i on / which would enable indexing on /System as well. Now I can also see the built-in apps in the Spotlight search results.\n\nA: I have seen cases where some file or files on the system interrupt the indexing process and since that proceeds in a non-obvious pattern (to my eyes), you might have apps that show up and then don’t if there’s an issue with the importer.\nI often make a second account on the Mac and sign out of the first - then sign in to the second account to let spotlight make a new “base index” for that user. I also eject all disks except the OS disk before logging out and disconnect them - they can influence search when connected.\nFrom there you can attack this based on the issue causing it:\n\n*\n\n*could be settings\n\n*could be disk corruption\n\n*could be file corruption (or spotlight crashing on some good files)\n\n*could be user specific issues\n\n", "Q: Why is part of my screen not accessible when I plug in an external display?

Not sure if this is related.\n\nI've looked around and haven't seen anyone else reporting this issue.  Is it just me or can anyone explain what is going on and how I can fix it without needing to restart my machine?\n\nA: I suppose your only option for clearing up the processes responsible for this ( raring the restart which you said you want to avoid)  would be to log out of the graphical session (apple menu log out) and then try logging back in.\nShutting down the os is my first option when displays are.

Simply exporting photos from one library to another in MacOS Photos will remove some of the features of the photos.\nIn MacOS Monterey, this feature has been added to Photos (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209528).

Can I use third party USB-C wall adapters to power a 2021 iMac via any of its four USB-C ports?\nWhat is the minimum wattage required with USB-C, in order to operate the iMac at normal and performance CPU frequencies?\n\nA: Neither the 2021 iMac, nor any iMac, nor any desktop Mac that Apple has ever released, contains the necessary electronic circuitry that is required to allow powering the computer from any source other than its mains power inlet. Adding this would entail additional design complexity, PCB space, QA resource allocation, and, most of all, cost, all for a device that is marketed for the low end of the market. Apple sees no reason to do this, and, consequently, it hasn't.\n[That being said, your question is a reasonable one to ask: Recent iMacs are designed with Thermal Design Points (TDPs) comparable to MacBook Pros and therefore need to keep their power requirements low enough to meet those numbers. The 2021 iMac uses a 143 W power supply, which is about 1.5x that of the 96 W supply that the 16\" MacBook Pro uses. This is beyond the 100 W maximum power that can be supplied by the current USB Power Delivery 3.0 standard, but is within the 240 W of the recently announced (May 2021) 3.1 standard.]\n", "Q: How to keep /private/tmp on a RAM drive with Big Sur & Monterrey+? How do you setup /private/tmp on a RAM drive with Big Sur & Monterrey+?\nI will explain some of my concerns here below, but my question is simply that. Apparently some have misunderstood and thought I want an explanation of why it doesn't need to be done, but in my case it does need to be done and I simply want to do this, especially since I operate without SIP enabled.\nReducing wear on solid state drives seems to be more and more important as we see SSD usage increasing. With the newer MacBook Pros (2016 on) and now the much more expensive 2021 MacBook Pros (MacBookPro18,1-4), some of us have alarm bells going off about trying to reduce cache wear when possible.\nFor example, I believe it is wise to purchase the 64GB models not for the sake of performance, but rather to give the OS and apps more breathing room so that less swapping and hard drive usage occurs.\nIn this same line of thinking, it seems to me that a 4gb or 8gb or even 16gb RAM drive might be useful to replace /private/tmp and any temporary file usage if one develops software, games or requires frequent and heavy writes/rewrites on the drive.\nMemory caching for fs rw is also not often effective in scenarios I've seen.\nAs you may have noted, I originally asked this as well, but this is secondary to the \"how to\" and thus I acknowledge having made a mistake of essentially putting two questions into one, but will leave this here since it answers why I got the most highly voted current reply below:\nHas anyone put any thought or study into this to see what kind of load it reduces from the storage drive?\nAnd does anyone have a solid method for creating and mounting a RAM drive such that it's in use right at system boot? (eg, we used to be able to put things like this into RC and we could still do so if we are able to mount the root volume RW after disabling SIP it seems.)\n\nA: UPDATE: The question was changed to focus specifically on how to create a RAM disk on Big Sur/Monterey. You can do that by opening the Terminal and running the following command:\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'ramtmp' `hdiutil attach -nobrowse -nomount ram://8388608`\n\nThis will create a 4 GB RAM disk that is available on /Volumes/ramtmp. Now you can set your compiler to use that folder for temporary files.\nIf it is important for you that it must be the /private/tmp path name that leads to the RAM-disk, you can set that up manually using a few commands like this:\nhdid -nomount ram://8388608\nnewfs_hfs -v tmp /dev/rdiskX\ndiskutil mount -mountPoint /private/tmp /dev/diskX\n\n(where X is to be replaced in both commands by the number output by the hdid command)\nI still very much doubt that it will have any real impact on the wear on your SSD in the long run.\nIn the comments you write that you specifically target the use case of \"compiling compilers and large projects\". As you haven't given more details, it is difficult to know whether you're talking about yacc, SableCC or some other compiler compiler, and what exactly you mean by large projects.\nHowever when I use compiler compilers, or just in general compile large projects using clang or Xcode, I do not find that /private/tmp is \"hit a lot\". For Xcode projects I rather find that the DerivedData folder is used a lot (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/). It makes more sense to put that on a RAM-disk, not for the sake of reducing wear, but rather to optimize performance. You can find existing programs that make that part easy - including mounting it automatically after boot:\nhttps://github.com/ikiapps/Setup-Xcode-Derived-Data-RAM-Disk\nOLD ANSWER:\nI think the alarm bells are unfounded. There's no reason to believe that SSD usage is increasing (whatever that might even mean) now at a higher rate than it was 5 years ago for example - or that this means that ordinary gamers, users or developers should seek their own ways to reduce SSD wear.\nOn the contrary over the years, SSD drives have become larger and have better firmware. A larger capacity SSD drives means that wear-levelling becomes easier. More information from the operating system to the SSD's internal firmware also means that wear-levelling becomes easier.\nAll this means that even though \"usage\" might be increasing, the SSDs are seldom the first hardware component of your component to fail - and failing because of too many writes is even less likely. Remember also that such a failure is actually one of the few hardware failures that have few repercussions - i.e. the drive goes \"read-only\" and you can often copy the data over to an external drive without losing anything.\nPurchasing the amount of RAM suitable for your specific workload is always a good idea. If you have lots of swapping in and out, performance usually deteriorates so much that the system becomes a drag in almost anyone's eyes. This also wears the SSD ever so slightly. In that case, you really want extra RAM.\nHowever, if you're just dealing with memory leaks (like many are), the swapping becomes onesided and does not affect performance to nearly the same degree. It also means that there's almost no practical wear to the SSD.\n/private/tmp is usually used for short-lived, temporary files created by applications, and small, long-lived files created by daemons - such as named pipes, pid-files and unix domain sockets. In any case these are usually \"write once, read once\". I doubt that you would get any real reduction of such \"heavy write/rewrites\" for ordinary macOS applications (including for software development and gaming) by moving it to a RAM disk. Instead you risk that programs starts failing if the RAM disk runs out of space. Remember also that these temporary files are still being cached by the usual file system cache, so they do have a chance of existing in RAM, if the operating system chooses so.\nGetting a RAM disk working right at boot for this particular scenario is actually not that interesting. If you're having heavy writes occurring all the time, the few seconds during boot are only a drop in the ocean - and it doesn't really matter that the RAM disk is only established after booting.\n", "Q: How to record from the audio-out port on a Bose S1 Pro speaker into an iPhone I have a Bose S1 Pro portable PA speaker, which has an audio-out port. I wish to record from this into the Voice Memos app on an iPhone 12 Pro. I'm a little confused as to which cable I need to purchase in order to achieve this.\nThe page https://toonz.ca/bose/wiki/index.php?title=S1_Pro_Line_Out_to_a_Third_Party_Device contains a bunch of technical information, including:\n\nThe S1 Pro Line Out is 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) Tip-Ring-Sleeve jack. That's balanced mono - NOT stereo....\n\n\nIf the recording device has a single stereo minijack input you will need to convert to S1 Pro System balanced mono output to an unbalanced signal..... This will provide an unbalanced signal to the LEFT side of the stereo buss.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Since the iPhone 12 has no headphone jack I'll need to use the Lightning to 3.5mm jack, but as far as I understand this is TRRS (not Tip-Ring-Sleeve). Is this a problem?\n\n*Can the Voice Memos app handle an \"unbalanced signal\"? (I'm not entirely sure what this means - if it's simply the left channel only, I can adjust this in the editing software)\n\n*Do I need any intermediary equipment (mixer, DAC, etc) between the speaker and phone, aside from the cable?\n\n\nA: You have several 'translations' that need to happen in order to achieve this.\nFirst - your Bose system runs line level, balanced. Your phone as it stands needs mic level, unbalanced.\nUnbalanced is 'regular home audio' - 2 wires, one signal (hot) the other ground [people tend to think of them as positive (+ve) & negative (-ve), but that's not truly the case.]\nBalanced line is used in pro audio equipment to be able to push signals much, much further without introducing interference noise. It does this by using 3 wires instead of 2. Instead of just signal & ground, it has +ve signal (hot), -ve signal (cold) [which is exactly the same as +ve but phase reversed] & ground.\nRushing quickly past the maths, if you get interference on a cable, then by phase-inverting -ve & adding it to +ve, you cancel out the interference. [Don't worry about exactly how.]\nTo unbalance your signal, you need to connect the cold to the ground & send that to the ground pin at the other end. Hot goes to hot +ve. This cancels out the phase reversed signal so your receiving end can understand it… otherwise they'd add up to silence.\nSo, to get round your first issue, you need to find an unbalancing cable, or make one up.\nRegular TRS to TS jacks you find on eBay & Amazon will connect the wrong pins, so you'll do best to find a local pro music store & ask them to get one made. You want TRS balanced to TS unbalanced. They'll know how to do it properly.\nSecondly - & this is going to need hardware - you need to match your levels properly. Audio levels are measure in decibels (dB) [but there are 20 ways to measure dB, so again I'll skip the math]. There's a comprehensive, if somewhat mind-numbing, guide here - BiAmp.com - Gain structure: input and output levels\nFor our case we're going to be working in dBu which goes from -infinity up to zero & then past into positive values. Mic level is around -60 up to -35dBu [that's very quiet] Line level is -10 on consumer gear but +4dBu on pro gear [that's really loud.] Every 3dB change is equal to double the power, every 6dB is double the volume, so you see it ramps up a long way. These are nominal levels, not absolute.\nYour phone's input is expecting mic level. Your Bose is outputting pro-level line.\nFrom your S1 resource -\n\n¼ inch (6.3 mm) Tip-Ring-Sleeve jack: Nominal +2.4 dBu, Max +20 dBu\nUsing a Tip-Sleeve unbalanced cable will result in a drop in the audio level of -6dBu.\nThere is no limiter on this output so you may get more than the rated maximum, but it could sound distorted.\n\nThat's a whole lot of level for a mic input - possibly enough to destroy the circuit.\nYou can get consumer line-mic level adapters pretty cheap. This one from Headset Buddy for instance. However, they expect consumer line level at -10, not pro level at +4. They provide a -20dB reduction… this is nowhere near enough.\nTo be safe, we need to figure out how many volts this all translates to.\nThe calculation is more than I have fingers & toes, so this handy calculator comes in… err… handy - http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-db-volt.htm\nFrom the S1 guide above, we need to be safe to +14dBu after unbalancing. Using our handy calculator, that comes out to 3.88Vpp [that's volts, peak to peak… don't worry about it].\nThe only product I can find that will take that kind of level straight into an iPhone is the IK Multimedia iRig Pro I/O at about £$€150. This can handle from 30 mVpp to 6.9 Vpp on a combination line/instrument preamp, so should have plenty of headroom.\nArmed with that & your unbalanced cable - you're ready to go ;)\n", "Q: How do I ask Siri to tell me what my next Outlook appointment is (just MacBook/MacOS solution, no iPhone) On my company laptop, all my meetings are in Outlook.

The confusing part is that it actually solved itself. I think it has to do with the disk encryption status - while the disk is initially encrypting changing this security setting does not appear to be possible. After coming back to this setting about 6 hours later, it suddenly started working, for no apparent reason.\nI tried completely disabling disk encryption and re-enabling it - and at first, it did not work. But after a few hours, the problem suddenly disappeared. So it appears that changing this setting when you first start setting up your Mac is the problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue, exact same symptoms as OP. I looked into it further and wonder if during OPs troubleshooting he was entering Fallback Roceovery mode which requires 2 quick presses of the power button and then holding on the second press until it starts to load Start up options. In Fallback rocovery mode you cannot change Security settings in Startup Security Utility. It will give you the same error OP had every single time.\nAfter additional research I was able to fix it by launching in regular recovery mode by pressing the power button once and holding it. That launches into Regular Recovery mode and allows you to make security changes.\nI found the answer here. https://iboysoft.com/wiki/fallback-recovery-os-mode.html\n\nA: For anyone who has \"FileVault\" enabled, try disabling it and then restarting. Much easier than trying to quickly tap the power button to enter Recovery mode when the system prompts you to \"Restart.\" Very very frustrating they use the power button to manage this process; it's very difficult and confusing when the power is coming on or off for the machine. Anyways, disabling FileVault allowed me to get around this.\n\nA: The correct method to resolve this issue from Apple themselves is:\nmacOS Recovery requires:\n\n*\n\n*The silicon Mac to be shutdown first\n\n*wait 5 seconds after the screen goes black\n\n*Then press and hold the power button, don't let go until you see \"loading startup options\"\n\n*Then everything will work\n\n*Same process goes for T2 chip Macs\n\n(if they still don't and your sure you followed all instructions a slight possibly the firmware needs to be revived: but as a last resort)\n", "Q: Using a 2TB SSD on a 2016 MacBook Pro My MacBook Pro was filled up by old iPhone backups. I need to clear them up before I can use it to do backup for the 4th phone of my family. I found I had a 2 TB external SSD and tried to copy things on it but failed. The system said the SSD was read-only. Disk utilities said the 2 TB SSD was formatted in NTFS format. Was that the reason that my MacBook Pro refuses to copy things onto it? Do I need to reformat that into Mac format, but was there a 3rd solution that I can share the SSD among my computers?\n\nA: You could try shrinking the partition containing NTFS volume and create a new FAT32 writable volume in the free space. To do this, you would need either a computer with Windows installed or your existing Mac. Do to this with your existing Mac, you would have to use the Boot Camp Assistant to make a bootable Windows 10 USB flash drive installer. Instead of installing Windows, you would boot from this installer, open a Command Prompt window and use the diskpart command to shrink the NTFS volume and create the new writable volume. If you want the new volume to be ExFAT or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format, then you would have to erase the new FAT32 volume from macOS using either diskutil or the Disk Utility.\n\nA: macOS is able to read NTFS by default, but it doesn't come with write support. There are third-party solutions for that, like NTFS-3G (there are multiple questions dealing with this product here on Apple.SE).\nIf you are using this SSD only on your Mac, using NTFS would be a poor solution (performance, feature support). Instead, just reformat the SSD with APFS.\nFor pure data transfer, another option would be to format the disk with exFAT which has read and write support natively on both Windows and macOS. This filesystem is lacking features you would expect on a modern system, but if all you want is transfer images, videos, ZIPs, and the like, it is sufficient.\n", "Q: Detect silent audio via FFMPEG (entire file) I am trying to pass audio and video files into FFMPEG and determine if their audio is entirely silent (I don't need to detect if the audio stream is present or not, just if it is silent), and ideally return a boolean at the end of it all, or a 0/1.

I have an iCloud and Gmail account set up in the Calendar app on iOS. The Gmail account is shown at the top, but I would prefer to have it below the iCloud account.\nIs there any way to change the order of accounts in the Calendar?\nI can’t find an option in the UI. If there is some workaround (like removing/adding the accounts in a certain order), I would be happy with that as well.\n\n\nA: There’s no way in the iOS version of Calendars to reorder your specific accounts and even if you’re able to accomplish this on your Mac, it won’t carry over.\nI’ve also tried renaming the accounts to force an order alphabetically but that also does not affect the order.\nIf this is a must-have feature, you will likely need to look at a 3rd party Calendar app for iOS unfortunately.\n", "Q: Time Machine only shows 'case-sensitive' after formatting backup drive, fails and asks it to be renamed, leading to other problems I always thought any *nix-based system like OS X would be case-sensitive, although (just tested to make sure!) on Big Sur I cannot create 'FILE1' and 'file1' in the same folder, so it appears case-insensitive.\nHowever, after it has formatted my backup drive, Time Machine only has a \"case sensitive\" option? The drive is shown at the top (as the external drive icon and title, not selectable, with only \"Remove Disk\" as an option) with the same Time Machine icon and same drive name beneath it, marked 'Case-sensitive'—I presume this is the usual interface and default choice?\nAfter the first attempt, however, Time Machine fails (red question mark to right) and asks me to rename \"one of the disks\" (when there's only one connected) to a long string: \"APPLE SSD APO512M Media - Data\" although renaming it simply causes Time Machine to show two identically-named disks\n\nHowever, after renaming to the string above and relaunching Time Machine, my renamed disk appeared twice (again) and on choosing the second case-sensitive (and only possible) option in the list of external disks the backup went ahead. Why the two identically-named disks, with one marked \"case-sensitive\"? After the first renaming from \"backup| to the above, Time Machine showed the following:\n\nBut \"Backup\" changed to the long name as soon as I selected \"choose\" for the second disk (with the long name) in the list.\nI do a lot of web development on Linux servers, so I'm used to case-sensitivity, and I don't use any Adobe products (I understand they clash with case-sensitive drives) so what issues might I encounter with my separate but very similar backups from two non-M1 laptops running Big Sur or later?\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         500.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +500.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Me...⁩ 563.2 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 313.4 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                622.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Me...⁩ 114.7 GB   disk1s5\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Media⁩ 15.3 GB    disk1s7\n   7:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.3 GB    disk1s7s1\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *5.0 TB     disk2\n   1:         Microsoft Reserved ⁨⁩                        134.2 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk3⁩         5.0 TB     disk2s2\n\nWithout the external drive:\n% diskutil list internal\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         500.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +500.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Me...⁩ 562.8 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 313.4 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                622.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Me...⁩ 126.9 GB   disk1s5\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨APPLE SSD APO512M Media⁩ 15.3 GB    disk1s7\n   7:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.3 GB    disk1s7s1\n\nRunning diskutil ap listgroups after removing the extra (case insensitive) disc via the Time Machine interface:\ndiskutil ap listgroups\nAPFS Containers (2 found)\n|\n+-- Container disk1 817F6958-3C62-4EDB-A445-A960AF3396E8\n|   |\n|   +-> Volume Group B696A136-89E9-4997-9E61-0061EC256CB0\n|       =================================================\n|       APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s5 (Data)\n|       Name:                      APPLE SSD APO512M Media - Data\n|       Volume UUID:               B696A136-89E9-4997-9E61-0061EC256CB0\n|       Capacity Consumed:         119796424704 B (119.8 GB)\n|       -------------------------------------------------\n|       APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s7 (System)\n|       Name:                      APPLE SSD APO512M Media\n|       Volume UUID:               684AFD14-2E4E-4CDC-AD01-F8FC648F692A\n|       Capacity Consumed:         15332147200 B (15.3 GB)\n|\n+-- Container disk3 D68F4756-2B56-47E9-8E3A-AF8F0F132ADD\n    |\n    +-> No Volume Groups among 1 Volume\ndaveeveritt@Daves-MacBook-Air ~ % \n\nFinally, what I see (I added comments about what each contains on Jean_JD's answer).

It also says the USB-C ports are \"data only\" or \"power only\" but they are both USB-C... how do you tell the difference? Will they support TB2 display?\nThe goal is to plug in a single USB-C cable into my MacBook and have my display etc all just work and not be plugging 3/4 things in and out of the MacBook each time.\nThanks\n\nA: For anyone who finds this from searching, here's what I've figured out:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207266\nThis explains that using the adapter required a proper Thunderbolt dock and not a normal USB-C extension, these docks are usually more expensive and powered externally through a barrel plug or similar to provide the pass-through power requirement for Thunderbolt.\nAs such, these more expensive docks remove the need for the MagSafe 1 adapter, because the dock can provide power over USB-C to the MacBook itself.\nDocks such as the ones listed on this article (probably laden with affiliate links) should work with pass-through video but I'm not going to get one to test this as the cost benefit is too low to me.\nLong story short.. I'm just going to use the display cable into the laptop directly and not bother docking it. The display itself is enough of a USB dock for my uses. Your millage may vary.\n", "Q: Do any of Microsoft Office for Mac packages offer inbuilt virtual printer? Apple's printing to PDF is an amazing, but I wonder if MS offers a virtual printer service to generate XPS. Please note that the question is specific to the Microsoft Office products, not printing to file in general on macOS.\nAs Windows users may know, Microsoft Office for Windows package often preinstalls (at least for legacy OSs) the virtual XPS printer driver allowing for \"print-to-PDF\"-like functionality.\nDoes any of Microsoft Office for Mac packages (whether old or current) offer inbuilt printing to XPS, PDF or anything else without using the macOS print to PDF feature?\n\nA: Printing to PDF is a feature built-in to macOS and as such is not something that requires special support from each individual application like on Windows.\nWhen you have Microsoft Office installed, you can click Print to open up the standard macOS print dialog. On the bottom left you'll find a drop-down button \"PDF\" that allows you to save to PDF, save to Postscript and sharing with various services including email.\nYou do not need to have any kind of \"virtual XPS printer driver\" installed for this to work.\nThere's no \"virtual XPS printer driver\" for Microsoft Office on Mac. The current Microsoft Office does not support saving or exporting to XPS.\nAs a format, XPS itself is also not supported by built-in macOS apps such as for example Preview.app for viewing. You can get a number of different third-party XPS viewers on the App Store though.\n\nA: When doing my research, I stumbled this article on XPS on Library of Congress Website. The article describes XPS format, namely saying this,\n\nThe expectations for XPS as a fixed-layout document format for sharing with end users was less successful. Support for the XPS format was never integrated into Apple's operating systems. For Mac OS X 10.0, released in March 2001, Apple had chosen to develop its own code associated with PDF (based on PDF version 1.3 ...\n\n\nMac OS X came with the Preview application, which was a PDF Viewer, and users could print to PDF.

Although XPS viewers were developed for Mac OS X by third parties, there was little reason for Mac users to acquire them.\n\nThere is no indication either Apple or MS Office should ever give direct support to XPS printing\n\nA: Yes, sort of.  Word for Mac can still produce XPS.  But not through the print dialogue.  You have to change the preferences on how to save files.\nFile→Print goes to the standard Mac print dialogue which offers to save as PDF or Postscript, but not XPS.\nXPS also not available via Save as…\n", "Q: Setting permanent environment variable I want to set a permanent environment variable, I have used the .profile, .zshrc, .bash_profile, however, none have worked, after doing the command source .profile it works while I have the terminal open, but then when I close the terminal and reopen a new saves these variables.\nThis is how I save the variables in the files\nexport M2_HOME=/Applications/apache-maven-3.3.3\nexport PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin/\n\n\nA: You can add to the end of the file ~/.zprofile the the following instructions :\n# Setting PATH for Apache-maven-3.3.3\nPATH=\"/Applications/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\nThen you close the terminal and reopen and verify\nYou can also replace by this :\n# Setting PATH for Apache-maven-3.3.3\nexport M2_HOME=/Applications/apache-maven-3.3.3\nPATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin/\nexport PATH\n\n", "Q: MacOS Firewall: Program grayed out, can't be added to Firewall Options In MacOS Monterey (12.0.1), I am running Python 2.7 from an Anaconda virtual environment.\nEach time I run the Python script, I am asked if I want to accept incoming network connections:\n\nI have tried multiple times to \"Deny\" or \"Allow\" this (which requires me to enter the username & password of an administrator user). However, each time I run the script I am presented with the same question.\nWhen I go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall Options and press + to add an application manually, I am unable to select Python 2.7 in the file picker (it's grayed out, as can be seen in the screenshot below):\n\nAccording to Get Info, my user has Read & Write privileges for this file, which also seems to be true in Terminal for the file and the directory it's in:\n-rwxrwxr-x@  1  my_user  staff   8464 Oct 30 12:21 python2.7\ndrwxr-xr-x@  81 my_user  staff   2592 Nov 19 10:10 bin\n\nHow can I stop this annoying pop-up from reappearing?\n\nA: You can try controlling the firewall through the Terminal interface of the Application Firewall, socketfilterfw.\nStep-by-step\nsocketfilterfw is located under /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall, so first go there in Terminal:\ncd /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall\n\nThen you can list existing rules with:\n./socketfilterfw --listapps\n\nYou can add an application with the following command:\nsudo ./socketfilterfw --add <full path to application executable>\n\nTerminal should print Incoming connection to the application is permitted when successful.\nExample: allowing python through in an Anaconda install\nIt seems you have installed python through Anaconda and are trying to let it through the firewall.\nIn this example I go through all the steps in Terminal.\nI assume that you're working in the base environment, if not, you need to change that name in the first steps.\nconda activate base\npython_loc=$(which python)\ncd /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall\nsudo ./socketfilterfw --add $python_loc\nsudo ./socketfilterfw --listapps\n\nThe last step should show the freshly added python application in the list:\nALF: total number of apps = 8 \n\n...\n\n8 :  /Users/username/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3.9 \n     ( Allow incoming connections ) \n\nNote that python is often a symlink to another binary (e.g. python3.9 or python2.7). During the creation it's fine to refer to the symlink, but when you want to remove the rule again (with ./socketfilterfw --remove) you need to provide the actual path that is listed by socketfilterfw (/Users/username/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3.9 in this case), not the symlink.\n\nA: Sometimes, the executable's code signature becomes invalid, and that makes it impossible to make it properly work with the Firewall Options. The system will keep asking the same dialog. That can become pretty disruptive if your process restarts very often.\nRunning codesign -s - -f /opt/homebrew/opt/python3/bin/python3.9 will make your next \"Allow\" response to the dialog or adding to the Firewall Options to persist. You may have to remove the item from Firewall Options first.\ncf. https://geoff.greer.fm/2015/04/26/os-x-code-signing-and-firewalls/\n", "Q: Installed a password manager and now safari won't autofill I installed a password manager from the App Store and since then my autofill in Safari has stopped working. I cannot uninstall the application as I do not have root permission. Does anyone know how to turn my autofill back on?\nI have looked at the autofill tab under safari > preferences but the options there are blanked out so I cannot turn them on.\nI am using macOS Catalina\n\n\nA: To cleanly undelete apps you need to use an 'uninstaller' app.  I suggest either Remove-It or App Cleaner & Uninstaller.  You will need to use your admin password when deleting apps with either of these tools.\n", "Q: ssh: permissions in files /etc I think, that I have broken the permissions for (at least) the files in /etc, and this is why ssh is no longer working.\nhosts.allow:\nsshd : ALL\nALL : ALL\n\nhosts.deny:\nsshd: ALL\n\nhosts:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

The TB2 connector is different from the TB3/TB4 connector, so you need an adapter for the Apple Thunderbolt Display (ADT), e.g. this one from Apple. The monitor connected via HDMI will work the same, you simply plug it into your new machine and there you go. For the Thunderbolt-Ethernet Adapter you will need a new one as well, you can basically buy any USB-C/TB3/TB4 to Ethernet adapter.\n", "Q: Mounty did not work properly after upgrading to Monterey When I use Mac OS Big Sur I used Mounty to make NTFS external drivers writable.

(Hosting provider says SMB and NFS will not work).\n\nA: The simplest way appears to be using cron to 'touch' a file in the remote directory every five minutes.  This will keep the mounted directory from becoming \"unconfigured\" but it won't fix it if that happens.  So I added another job to run in the wee hours each morning to umount and re-mount.\n", "Q: Connect macbook air 2015 to M1 Macbook air I want to transfer files from my early 2015 MacBook air to 2020 M1 MacBook air.\nConnected with the USB-A to USB-C cord. Tried using target disk method through system preferences. 2015 model goes into target disk mode but M1 MacBook does not show it.\nIs there any troubleshooting required, or is it not possible to transfer files through this method?\n\nA: USB target disk mode requires the target computer to have USB-C ports.  USB target disk mode does work in spite of Apple apparently scrubbing all mention of it from their website.  MacWorld documented it though: https://www.macworld.com/article/225340/got-a-new-macbook-usb-target-disk-mode-works-with-the-right-cable-which-apple-doesnt-sell.html\nI've used target disk mode on my MacBook Pro by USB before so this is not some myth MacWorld created.  I can only speculate on why Apple chose to hide this feature from users.  One possible reason is to avoid having to describe the very specific system requirements and process to people.\nA quick check of the system specifications on a 2015 MacBook Air tells me it does not have USB-C ports, that means target disk mode will not work on this laptop by USB.  The M1 laptop should support target disk mode by USB, but in reading the Apple documentation on this the laptop shows as a network share rather than a USB device.  Link: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-a-mac-apple-silicon-mchlb37e8ca7/12.0/mac/12.0\nIt looks like all you got wrong is which laptop should be in target disk mode.  Are you using target disk mode on the older laptop because it no longer boots?  If so then Thunderbolt should still work.  If not then try putting the newer M1 laptop in target disk mode and copy the files over USB that way.\n\nA: Target disk mode on Intel Macs requires USB-C, Thunderbolt, or FireWire on the target Mac, it does not work by USB-A on the target Mac. Can you try using a thunderbolt cable? (or airdrop?)\nfrom Transfer files between two Mac computers using target disk mode :\n\nIf you have two Mac computers with FireWire or Thunderbolt ports, you can connect them so that one of them appears as an external hard disk on the other. This is called target disk mode.\nNote: If either of the computers has macOS 11 or later installed, you must connect the two computers using a Thunderbolt cable.\n\nSince the 2020 M1 MacBook Air shipped with macOS 11, this applies to you.  You will have to use Thunderbolt if the target is the 2015 MacBook Air, or use the instructions linked to below to use the USB cable you have with the 2020 M1 MacBook Air as the target.

Sometimes with attached pictures like png and jpg files.\nQuite often I get people responding to me that they cannot see the attached file. And their response will almost always include the attached file, proving that they did get it. Often it is a Microsoft client, but I don't know for all different cases.\nSometimes I can explain that they need to check the list of attached files, if the pictures do not show inline in the text area. But other times they insist that they cannot see any traces of the attached picture, whatsoever.\nThis did not seem to be the case when I tested AirMail, for example.\nNo issues with attaching for example PDF files. I remember something about a configuration setting for attaching inline vs. not inline. But I cannot seem to find it anymore?\nWhat can I do about this. Is it possible to make Mail.app attach files in a manner, that \"all\" mail clients are able to understand?\n\nA: If those images are taken with an Apple device, since iOS11 those devices have defaulted to HEIC format for photos. However, this format (and codec) are not visible on Windows by default to date. Depending on how you attach those images in macOS, you may be sending the HEIC version instead of JPG.  Since macOS doesn't need to use .jpg or .heif to identify formats, it is quite easy to send images not realizing they are HEIC.\nTo avoid sending HEIC, (especially if you are having issues), you can change iOS camera to capture in JPG instead, using the 'more compatible' setting in Camera settings.\n\nA: First thing, check there are no illegal characters in the file name, e.g. / ? < > \\ : * | ” ^ are OK for Mac but not Windows PC.\nTo change the attachment from inline to \"not inline\", right click on it after attaching, then select \"View as icon\". I think this is on your Mac; what shows on the recipient's end will depend on their machine - but give it a try.\nAnother option is to zip and attach.\n\nA: Unfortunately, mail clients (and servers) can be configured in so many ways you can't foresee. Assuring that 'all mail clients' open the images without any problems is well-nigh impossible.\nFile size restrictions or restrictions on .jpeg files for virus content on the server side, and email app or web-based email reader misconfiguration can lead to images not showing.\nIf your recipients need the images for further processing, (rather than just viewing onscreen,) I suggest packaging the images in a .zip file so the graphic file format is immaterial until the archive is unpacked. If the images can't be viewed after unpacking, the onus is on the recipient to make sure the file format can be opened.\nIf the images are merely for viewing or simple printing, perhaps PDFs are a solution as they are pretty universally openable.\nThere are too many unknowns here for a more concrete answer. Bypassing mail client peculiarities from the start may be your only recourse.\n", "Q: What is the Screen Time app in /System/Library/CoreServices/?

Apple Care+ extends your coverage to 2 years from your AppleCare+ purchase date and adds up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months. However it will not cover the theft or lost product.\n\n\nYou can also check that in the below link.\n\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/support/products/mac/\n\nWhen I pointed out nothing on that page said 2 years and that that would make the \"Paid in Full\" option more expensive than the annual option the service representative transferred me to a different division in charge of AppleCare+\nThe first person on the AppleCare+ line just read the Terms of Service linked above. When I pointed out what they just read to me didn't list a time they escalated to an \"Expert\"\nThe \"Expert\" claimed it was 3 years of coverage and that I'd be able to renew annually after. When I asked where was this written they spent ~10 minutes looking and then escalated to another expert.\nThat expert verified that it is listed no where online making it impossible to compare plans. They claimed \"Paid in Full\" coverage is 3 years.\nSo, after 45 minutes of my time, that means effectively you save $48 for paying up front ($399 vs $447)\n", "Q: What process controls the microphone/camera indicator dots on macOS? Context for this: my dots got stuck. I had just finished a Discord call, but the dot stayed on all night with Control Center reporting that Discord was using my microphone. I had quit Discord, the app was not running, so there is no way it could still have been using my mic... right?\nI know I could restart my computer, but that's a hassle and I'd rather just quit the relevant system process instead. Besides, if there is an app hanging onto my mic from beyond the process grave, a reboot wouldn't help me to find which app is doing it.\nWhich program do I kill to reset these dots to make sure Discord (or anyone else) isn't actually using my microphone?\n\nA: On a hunch, I opened Activity Monitor and found Control Center.

And the dot was gone, so I must've guessed correctly.\nLoads faster than a restart, and now I know that Discord wasn't actually haunting my computer all night, probably.\n", "Q: Remap key combos to symbol characters For my home workstation I use a Moonlander which lets you add different layer-shifting to any key, and define each of the layers with whatever character desired.\nFor example, I'd have a symbols layer triggered by holding the \"f\" key.  From there, The \"j\" key would produce the \"(\" character, k would produce the \")\" character, etc.\nI realize that's the firmware on the keyboard doing the work there, but is there any way to get this type of custom behavior on the base laptop keyboard?\n\nA: Check out the Ukelele remapping software.  It lets you remap all keys whenever option or option plus shift are held down, or when caps lock is turned on.

But, when I try the Mail app, it snaps to slighty over half the screen width and displays the message \"Can't be more narrow\". This also happened for Spotify. I am running macOS Monterey. Why is it doing this?\n\nA: According to one of the Q&A's on Magnet's web site:\n\nSome apps don’t resize to a half screen and remain wider. What’s wrong?\nCertain apps require a minimal width of their window. In some cases the width can exceed half of your screen, particularly on small screens like Macbooks'.\n\n\nA: Found a Reddit thread that talked about this and someone proposed a better option called Rectangle: https://rectangleapp.com/\nWorks pretty awesome -- AND with Chrome!

This included Lightroom 6. When I clicked on it to open it, there was a box that came up that is the one I want to see again. It said something like that it needed me to install another program to make it compatible. I did so. And then there kept being other boxes popping up saying that these Cisco files were a security threat. I deleted them and now Lightroom won’t open. It flashes for a brief second but doesn’t load.)\n\nA: No, unfortunately the system does not keep any history of pop-ups, dialog boxes or modals.\nYou could try removing Lightroom 6 and either copying it from the old computer again or installing it from scratch.

But I can't accept the compromise of losing the automatic screen lock by simply having the MacBook not go to sleep.\nIn contrast, if I activate screen lock manually (I have it mapped to the Touch Bar, so through whatever mechanism that is), my music keeps playing. I can play/pause it using the touchbar or my Bluetooth headphones and control volume this way too. This is exactly the experience I want to have, but I want to be able to have it with the lid closed.\nIt would appear that pmset, which is what lets you disable sleep on lid close, is not the only family of tools I want here, because it is about managing power states and not about monitoring any hardware events per se. I don't really care what power state my MacBook is in when the lid is closed. (I mean I hope it's not hogging the battery too bad just playing some audio, but I don't have any hard drives I'm worried about being in use while moving it around or anything like that - it doesn't need to be asleep and I trust it to not burn itself up that way because this is a nice operating system.) I just want lid close to trigger a screen lock, basically, and also not a sleep.\nUnder Linux-y type environments this can be achieved (not sure how but I know there are lid events for dbus, which is part of the backbone of all modern Linux display managers), but I'm clueless as to how to achieve this particular thing.\n\nA: You can use the free and open source tool KeepingYouAwake for keeping the MacBook from going to sleep when you close the lid.\n", "Q: QEMU Clipboard Sharing on MacOS Host and Linux Guest I have QEMU running successfully on macOS Monterey 12.0.1\nI'm running a ParrotOS VM, and everything is working except that the clipboard is not shared between the host and guest.\nI have installed spice-vdagent in the guest OS but that has not helped.\nHere is the QEMU command I'm using to start the guest OS:\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -m 8G \\\n    -vga virtio \\\n    -display default,show-cursor=on \\\n    -usb \\\n    -device usb-tablet \\\n    -machine type=q35,accel=hvf \\\n    -drive file=parrot-2021.11.qcow2,if=virtio\n\n\nA: Did you compile qemu with SPICE extensions?

Gaming laptops throttle a heck ton when on battery while MacBooks don't. Why is that?\n\nA: Apple invests significant research and development resources for the purpose of creating state-of-the-art performance scaling and battery efficiency in its products. It's one of their top priorities across their entire product line if you look closely. There are entire teams of engineers, along with their commensurate engineering managers, project managers, and QA departments, who get paid to do nothing but think of and implement better ways of squeezing the most performance out of the least amount of battery power (and lowest heat dissipation), all day, every day. These are some of the brightest people in the world all coming together for one shared purpose.\nApple also has a key advantage in being able to cross-pollinate solutions between product lines, as these share much of their low-level software and, more recently, a significant amount of hardware. For example, an innovation in the xnu kernel that allows sufficiently low power consumption to allow the Apple Watch to have an always-on display can be reused to let the MacBook Pro turn off a significant amount of its electronics when there are no user-visible changes being drawn on-screen, allowing a significant energy savings without compromising performance.\nTo your specific point of good game performance on battery, there are many, many contributing factors. One in particular is dynamic frequency scaling and clock gating: Apple spends significant engineering effort on tuning algorithms that will raise & lower CPU and GPU voltage, and enable & disable CPU and GPU cores, to precisely meet instantaneous demand for these resources. So when you need responsiveness, you can quickly get it, and when you don't, much of the silicon quickly turns off and saves power, allowing you to run on battery for half the day instead of burning through it in an hour.\n", "Q: Is Apple enabling phishing attacks through theft of iOS clipboard data? How to prevent? My iPhone disclosed a friend's name and address to an app without my permission by stealing clipboard contents. Good thing it wasn't financial information!\nWhen I looked into the problem, I found this:\n\nIf you’re using an app that keeps pasting for no apparent reason, you\nmight want to revoke its pasting permission. Unfortunately, as of iOS\n14 and iPadOS 14, there is no way to stop an app from pasting. You\nwon’t find any options for this under Settings > Privacy.\n\nIs there really no way to stop Apple from giving random apps a backdoor to my clipboard contents?\nFor a company that claims to value customer privacy, this is unacceptable.\nPasswords, credit card numbers, crypto wallet seed phrases, and other alphanumeric strings that are not easily committed to memory must be among the most frequently copy-pasted content. If one cannot entrust one's smartphone clipboard with that data, it's a serious concern.\n\nA: iOS supports not only the general clipboard (technically, the general UIPasteBoard), but also named UIPasteBoards.\nAs the Apple docs explain named UIPasteBoards:\n\nYou can create named pasteboards with the class methods init(name:create:) and withUniqueName() for sharing data within your app and from your app to other apps that have the same Team ID.\n\nFrom what I know, apps that want to better protect data that users may have pasted into the clipboard, would use named UIPasteBoards rather than the general one, to prevent the kind of stealing you were asking about.\nTheoretically, on a jailbroken device, other apps may still be able to gain access to your app's named UIPasteBoard, so the app may want to implement other measures like encrypting data before transferring it to the named UIPasteBoard.\nTLDR: Apple does support a feature, namely, named UIPasteBoards, to help prevent stealing of clipboard data, but leaves it to app developers to use this feature on an app by app basis.\n", "Q: mp4 media file opens as text document I've downloaded a video which is being shown as a document file in finder.

How can I diagnose it?\nBigSur 11.1.6 on Macbook Pro 2017\n\nA: Many modal panels are presented on behalf of a host app by system daemons and frameworks. There is an interprocess communication (IPC) dance that takes place whenever an app presents such a panel. A bug in either side of this can cause an app to appear hung on a panel.\nRestarting the Mac will generally resolve problems like this. While it's impossible to know the exact cause in your case, it is likely a result of a bug affecting one of the UI frameworks or daemons, such as SystemUIServer. It's notoriously tricky to avoid deadlocks and livelocks when writing code that requires IPC, so bugs like this aren't all that surprising. (Especially when using poorly-written programs like Chrome and Firefox, which are well-known to employ a lot of nonstandard design patterns in lieu of standard APIs and thus cause all sorts of trouble beyond system instability.)\nIn general, to debug issues like this in the future in hopes of root-causing them, you should first collect a spindump during a period of time when you're experiencing an app hang. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet:\n sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n\n*Perform an operation that you know will be abnormally slow.\n\n\n*As soon as you begin to feel the slowness, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. We can take a look at it and come up with next steps for the investigation.\n", "Q: Can you tell iTerm2 profiles top-level windows to never show up in Cmd-Tab?

I recently reinstalled macOS Monterey (12.0.1) on my MacBook Air (Intel, 2020) and restored data from my Time Machine backup; APFS format.\nThat went well, but after I did this it seems like my external storage drive, named “Storage”, now has an older clone next to it called “Storage 1” in recent snapshots. See screenshot below of snapshot 2021-11-26-113550.\nI assume some kind of identifier for the system and drive itself changed when the restore happened. I am fine with that. But this fairly useless — and redundant — “Storage 1” is taking up about 700GB of space.\nI can’t seem to just delete it as a Time Machine backup is “Read Only” to the Finder and Terminal since this is the newer Time Machine format that uses APFS and snapshots instead of HFS+ and a standard filesystem scheme.\nWhat can I do to toss this “Storage 1” folder in the snapshots and free up that 700GB?\n\n\nA: With Time Machine to APFS (TMA), it is not possible to delete particular folders inside any Time Machine snapshots. This is the only downside of the change from TMH (Time Machine to HFS) to TMA.\nIt is possible to delete whole snapshots from TMA using tmutil command. I have done this under Big Sur, but I have seen some doubts cast on whether this is still possible for Monterey. But deleting whole snapshots is not what you are wanting.\nI suggest you start with a new Time Machine disk/volume and, at some point, discard your old backups. With sufficient free space on your existing TM disk you can create a new volume in Disk Utility and start a new Time Machine backup to that. Otherwise you need another physical disk.\n\nA: You can use tmutil associatedisk to associate the old storage backup directory with the active drive and that will allow Time Machine to carry the old backup history and avoid the duplicate entry:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/Storage \"/Volumes/{TimeMachineDrive}/Backups.backupdb/{MachineDirectory}/Latest/Storage 1\"\n\nOr if you just want to get rid of the \"Storage 1\" backup and don't care about the history, you can use the earlier command, but instead, associate the \"Storage 1\" directory with a volume that is excluded from backups.\nFor example plug a USB drive e.g. /Volumes/USB, it should be automatically excluded from backups by Time Machine. Then you can run:\nsudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/USB \"/Volumes/{TimeMachineDrive}/Backups.backupdb/{MachineDirectory}/Latest/Storage 1\"\n\nIn the next backup, Time Machine will wipe the \"Storage 1\" directory.\n", "Q: Problems with copying and pasting in Notes.app on macOS Big Sur I have a problem with copying and pasting in Notes.app.\nIf I select and copy text from notes in the main Notes window, I often see random snatches of text from elsewhere in the same note instead of the text I have selected. This is deeply annoying, particularly as I use Notes to store things like code examples, URLs etc. It's also highly irritating when trying to move bits of text around inside the same note.\nHowever, there is a workaround. If I double-click on a note to open it in its own window, this problem seems to vanish, and copying and pasting works just fine.\nObviously it is great to have this workaround but it is very difficult to always remember to open a note in its own window. It is more work than I should have to do, and it took me some time to figure out and verify.\nThese problems have even led me to consider replacing Notes.app entirely, but there doesn't seem to be another free notes app that does everything Notes.app can, let alone one that provides a notes import process.\nThe copy/paste problems with Notes.app reported here sound exactly like what I am experiencing.\nI am running Notes.app version 4.8.1 (1872) running on MacOS \"Big Sur\" 11.5.2 on a 2019 13\" MacBook Pro.\n\nA: After restarting the Notes app copy/paste starts working.\n\n*\n\n*Click on \"Quit Notes\" from menu or force quit\n\n*Open it again\n\n", "Q: Copy and Flatten directory contents with zsh I have a directory tree, where each subdirectory contains several different filetypes, I want to copy one particular filetype from each of the subdirectory, but I need to flatten the results, so that they all end up in one directory - only copying the newly added files and preserving permissions I have been using cp under zsh, with the following command line\ncp -np **/*.ftype ../destination\n\nWhich has worked brilliantly up until now. However, I've just reached a limit, I'm not sure if it's the number of directories in the source directory (currently 217) or the total number of directories / desired files, (somewhere between 2672 and 2690) but suddenly I'm getting the error argument list too long: cp\nI was hoping to use something like cp -np [A-Ma-m]**/*.ftype ../destination and split the job into parts, but I get no matches found: [A-Ma-m]**/*.ftype even though I know I have directories starting with the these ranges.\nI've also tried\nfind Base_dir/ -iname '*.ftype' | xargs -J% cp -np % ../destination \n\nbut it seems to break the directories at each point that there's a space character in the name, so it copies nothing.\nI'm sure I'm doing something silly wrong, but any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The length of a command line in a shell is limited, probably to something like 65536 characters. So if your pattern expand to more characters than that, you'll get the \"argument list too long\" error you mentioned.\nIn such cases, find is the better approach (it will then also work for users of other shells). The copy can be accomplished with one of\nfind base_dir/ -iname '*.ftype' -print0 | xargs -0 -J% cp -np % dest_dir/\nfind base_dir/ -iname '*.ftype' -exec cp '{}' dest_dir/ \\;\n\nPS: The quoting in -iname '*.ftype' is important here to avoid expansion by the shell.\nPPS: The error you get when using [A-Ma-m]**/*.ftype indicates that the pattern didn't get expanded. I don't know zsh very well, but most likely ** doesn't support additional patterns in front.\n\nA: “Argument list too long” is due to the total length of the command line (the command name and the arguments, plus one byte for each — plus the environment, actually). It is limited to sysctl kern.argmax bytes (KERN_ARGMAX in the C sysctl interface). The usual way to get around this error is to split the command into multiple calls.\nZsh commes with a function called zargs which helps with automatically running a command multiple times with successive sets of arguments. It's similar to the external command xargs but a different syntax.\nautoload -U zargs\nzargs -i -- **/*.ftype -- cp -- {} ../destination\n\nPut the autoload line in your ~/.zshrc to avoid having to type it each time you want to use it. (Some zsh configuration frameworks may do it for you.)\nThe option -i causes zargs to replace {} in the command by each argument in turn. This runs cp once per argument. zargs can also run the command with multiple arguments at a time, which is faster, but a limitation is that the grouped arguments have to go at the end of the command line. This is not a good match for cp since it needs the destination to go at the end.\nGNU cp has an option -T which allows the destination to be passed before the sources, precisely to facilitate the use of xargs (and zargs which is similar). Assuming you have GNU cp installed as gcp:\nzargs -- **/*.ftype -- cp -T ../destination --\n\nAlternatively, an advantage of zargs over xargs is that you can use it on a function.\nf () { $@[2,-1] $1 }\nzargs -- **/*.ftype -- f ../destination cp --\n\nNote how f only reorders its arguments, it doesn't have the cp -- … ../destination built in. The point is to keep the f call at least as long as the cp call, otherwise zargs would build a command line that goes over the limit when the cp -- and ../destination parts are added. Alternatively, pass a smaller limit:\nf () { cp -- \"$@\" ../destination/; }\nzargs -s $(($(sysctl kern.argmax) - $#functions[f])) -- **/*.ftype -- f\n\n(or just type a limit, e.g. zargs -s 999999 -- **/*.ftype -- f).\nAlternatively, stop worrying about the command line length limit and use the zcp function to do fancy copies. As before, put the autoload and alias lines in your .zshrc to avoid having to type them each time.\nautoload -U zmv\nalias zcp='zmv -C'\nzcp '**/(*.ftype)' '../destination/$1'\n\n", "Q: iPhone not making sound or waking up for push notifications I have an iPhone 13, running iOS 15.1, and I'm not being alerted to push notifications that arrive while the device is asleep.\nWhen I tap the screen, the display lights up and the message preview is there, so I know it's receiving them, but it's not notifying me.\nIf the phone is awake, and at the Home screen, and a push notification arrives, the phone makes the notification sound and shows the notification as expected.\nThis is a problem because it applies to text message notifications; I'm missing texts because the phone isn't notifying me.

The problem is not the VM but Linux. Also if you boot the Mac directly with Linux then the audio quality is a bit degraded. Apple pays more attention for these details.\n\nSolutions which are not working:\n\n*\n\n*JRiver Media Center: This is recognized as a dlna receiver, but it plays the songs in a completely wrong order.

Similarly the OpenJDKs are not universal.\nThus to run on ARM and Intel you need two different JREs\nPure Java code should run on any operating system (Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS and others) and on any architecture e.g. Intel, Arm, SPARC. So you only need one jar for all.\nThe C code could be built universal and your app could be packaged to include both JREs and the launcher (i.e. executable file given in Info.plist) works out from the architecture which JRE to call)\nJava 8 worked as it is Intel and so the whole process ran under Rosetta\n\nA: If you install the ARM JDK and find it breaks some app using e.g. gluegen, the simplest solution is to install the Intel JDK.\nIn particular, if you installed the ARM JDK to the default location using the disk image from Oracle's site, you can do precisely the same thing with the Intel JDK. This will effectively overwrite the ARM JDK.\nDon't try simply installing the (Intel) JRE on top of the mess. That does NOT work - the JRE built-into the ARM JDK somehow persists. (And following Oracle's instructions for deleting Java before re-installing the JRE won't help either.)\nAccording to Oracle's site, it's possible in theory to install multiple JDK's each in their own location, and switch between them. That would probably also work, but I haven't tried it.\n", "Q: Disk Utility deletes my Windows EFI partition I am trying to multiboot Windows, Linux and macOS Catalina all installed on the same drive.

But when I did this my Windows EFI partition was deleted and I can no longer boot in to Windows or Linux.\nI know how to rebuild the Win 10 boot files and Grub bootloader config and I also know what I am doing is not good practice.\nI am only asking what is going on such that a simply change to a drive partiton in Disk Utility causes the Windows EFI partition to become deleted? This didn't happen on my other multiboot set up when the macOS EFI partition is the first partition on the drive followed my macOS then Windows EFI/WindowsOS/LinuxOS.\nFrom testing the same thing happens when I use disk utility to clone a macOS installation into a container on a drive that already has Windows on it... the Windows EFI gets nuked.\nCheers,\nFlex\n\nA: I do not understand your justification for having two EFI partitions. Since you have stated both Windows and Linux are using the first EFI partition to boot, then there is no reason for having the second EFI partition. Most likely if you eliminated the second EFI partition, then the Disk Utility would not be deleting the first EFI partition.\nBoth the Disk Utility application and diskutil command are complex software developed by Apple to simplify the most disk management tasks. (Here a disk could be a HDD, SSD, USB drive, image file such as .dmg or .sparseimage, image folder such as .sparsebundle, etc...) Using either is a learned experience. In your case, you learned something the Disk Utility application can not do as expected. Or, can not do as expected with your version of macOS. I suppose in the future you should avoid this problem by using newfs_exfat command instead.\nUpdate Regarding Your Triple Boot\nWhen the Boot Camp Assistant is used to install UEFI booting Windows for a dual boot arrangement, the existing EFI partition is used for the Windows boot files. This EFI partition is 209.7 MB (409,600 sectors) when the sector size is 512 bytes and 314.6 MB (76,800 sectors) when the sector size is 4096 bytes. Since you are also installing an UEFI booting Linux and have a sector size of 512 bytes, an EFI partition of around 300 MB should be sufficient. I feel an increase to 300 MB is more that enough, since the boot files in the EFI partition for Ubuntu on my iMac only use about 9.8 MB.\nUpdate Regarding the Behavior of Disk Utility and diskutil\nBelow is the diskutil list disk1 output from a disk image.

Plugged it back into my own Mac, and the phantom storage did show up. After quitting and reopening Disk Utility, all the phantom storage disappeared.\nThis was very weird.

I want to open it in the first place to set the function keys to change the brightness, volume etc. I am not sure if I'm doing something wrong or missing something. Could someone help me with:\n\n*\n\n*Enabling the function keys to control brightness, volume etc. in Win 11 and\n\n*Resolving the BSOD issue that comes up when Bootcamp.exe is opened.\n\nHere is the procedure I followed to install Win 11:\n\n*\n\n*I installed Windows 11 Home (version 21H2, OS build 22000.348) on my early 2011 MacbookPro8,1 having High Sierra. First I converted the drive to GPT/MBR hybrid format by following the steps given under 'Method 2' in the answer to the question at How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2).\n\n*Then, I followed the steps given in the answer to the question at How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools? to install Win 11. I added registry entries to bypass TPM check, RAM check and SecureBootCheck before starting the installation. Win 11 is installed in the partition disk0s4.\n\n*I have disabled Boot Camp from windows startup as the BSOD was coming up a short while after the system booted up. If I double click Bootcamp.exe under Program files, I get a BSOD.\n\n*I had used the Boot Camp Assistant on my Mac to download the Window Support Software. I clicked on the \"Action\" pulldown on the Boot Camp Assistant menu bar to download it.\n\n*Before starting the whole process, I had partitioned the harddisk into three - one had macOS, a second one for Win 11 and a third one that's empty right now.\n\nI have been working on Win 11 full time for a week now without any other issues. It would be wonderful if the function keys also work as in macOS.\n\nA: Finally, what resolved the issue on my mac was the BootCamp package 041-98143.\n\n*\n\n*I used Brigadier (https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier) to download it.\nbrigadier.exe --model MacBookPro11,1 \n\n\n*The URL that Brigadier fetched the package from was http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/62/58/041-98143-A_HN8B941A1T/nknv1gt3xcgylggwc11kl5e0j4296tjfo1/BootCampESD.pkg\n\n\n*Then, I opened BootCamp/Setup.exe from within the extracted folder but got the message, \"This version of Bootcamp is not intended for this computer model.\" and could not proceed with the installation.\n\n\n*So, I right-clicked the Setup.exe and under the Compatibility tab, checked the box Run this program in compatibility mode for: and chose the only option that was displayed below it - 'previous version of the OS' (or something like that, I don't remember the exact words.)\n\n\n*This time the Setup file got executed. It repaired the existing package and installed/ reinstalled the drivers.\n\n\n*After the installation, I could open Bootcamp.exe. There was no BSOD this time. The fn-keys for brightness, keyboard backlight, media keys and volume also work. I was also able to enable one-finger and two-finger tap controls in the Bootcamp control panel that opens up on clicking Bootcamp.exe. Now I've set Boot Camp Manager to run at startup. Only when it runs do the keyboard and touchpad work as in mac. Otherwise only their basic functions work.\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*Distribution 041-98143 supports the following models: MacBook8,1, MacBookAir5,1, MacBookAir5,2, MacBookAir6,1, MacBookAir6,2, MacBookAir7,1, MacBookAir7,2, MacBookPro9,1, MacBookPro9,2, MacBookPro11,1, MacBookPro11,2, MacBookPro11,3, MacBookPro11,4, MacBookPro11,5, MacBookPro12,1, MacPro6,1, Macmini6,1, Macmini6,2, Macmini7,1, iMac13,1, iMac13,2, iMac13,3, iMac14,1, iMac14,2, iMac14,3, iMac14,4, iMac15,1.\n\n*Now when I open the same BootCamp/Setup.exe, Win 8, Win 7 and Vista are listed as the options. But when I set the compatibilty mode to Win 8 and try to run it, I get the same message ,\"This version of BootCamp is not intended...\". I don't think I'll need to run it again, though.\n\n*When DavidAnderson wrote that a newer MBP's BootCamp package might work on mine, I looked for the last 13\" MBP that didn't have force touch or touch bar in the user guides at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201300 . I assumed that both would have similar hardware. This happened to be the 2014 model, MacBookPro11,1.\n\n*I don't know if other packages would work as well but this one worked for me.\n\n\nA: I finished doing a clean install of Windows 11 on my 2011 iMac. I also encountered a BSOD. The cause was also Bootcamp.exe. While your answer solved your problem, I took a different approach to get a newer Bootcamp.exe. Instead, I used \"Apple Software Update\". The steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*If not done automatically, run the \"Boot Camp Installer\" by opening Setup.exe in the BootCamp folder on the flash drive. See image below.\n\nNote: When the \"Boot Camp Installer\" finishes, do not restart the Mac.\n\n\n\n\n*Download and install all Updates to \"Apple Software Update\". In other words, run \"Apple Software Update\". If there is an update for \"Apple Software Update\", then only install this update by first deselecting any additional items. In my case, I needed to update \"Apple Software Update\"  twice. If asked to restart, do not restart.\n\n\n*Once Apple Software has finished updating itself, then download and install any addition items. In my case, Boot Camp was updated. If asked to restart, do not restart.\n\n\n*When \"Apple Software Update\" no longer shows any items, quit \"Apple Software Update\", then restart your Mac.\n\nI also installed an UEFI booting Windows 11 on a 2013 iMac and a 2018 Mac mini. \"Apple Software Update\" also had Boot Camp updates for those two Macs.\n", "Q: 5.1 audio from MBP USB-C to HDMI I am struggling to get surround sound from my 2020 MacBook Pro (Intel version).\nI also have a 2015 MBP that has an HDMI port which I connect to my Denon AVR and it gives me glorious Dolby/DTS 5.1 whilst passing the visuals to my TV. So I know my media is fine.\nMy 2020 MBP only has USB-C ports. So I first tried with this USB hub that has an HDMI port. My AVR only sees 2 channel audio and the Midi app in MacOS only shows 2 channels being available.\nI have also tried this USB-C to HDMI cable and get exactly the same results.\nThe manufacturer of the 2nd cable couldn't get it working either and issued a full refund.\nSo how can I get HDMI surround sound from my 2020 MBP?\nI've read it could be an issue with how the USB-C signal is being converted and maybe using DisplayPort as the middle man, but is this a quirk of the MBP or the adapters?\n\n\nA: I believe your problem is that the HDMI adapters you tried so far only support stereo audio, to get 5.1 audio requires an HDMI adapter that supports it.\nIn these USB-C HDMI cables is a small system-on-chip computer that does the conversion from the native DisplayPort (or \"DP\") to HDMI.  That computer in the cable will have to tell the Mac what kind of audio and video to output, then do the conversion, and if the chip in the cable was programmed only to handle stereo audio then it's not going to provide a data path for the six audio channels needed for 5.1 surround sound.  DP supports 5.1 audio, HDMI supports 5.1 audio, but that doesn't mean every adapter from DP to HDMI supports 5.1 audio.  Look in the specs of the adapter cable for the number of audio channels it supports, if it doesn't tell you then assume it supports only two channel stereo.\nI was curious if I could find a DP to HDMI adapter that specified the number of audio channels it supports, and that the number supported was more than two channel stereo, and found this:  https://www.startech.com/en-us/audio-video-products/cdp2hdmm5mh\nI have no affiliation with StarTech other than being a customer in the past, most of all they just happened to be near the top of my search results when looking for examples.\nIf your display has DP input then maybe you should use that instead.  By using the DP input there is no protocol conversion in the cable, the cable should be less expensive and not limit your audio options.\n\nA: This is extremely useful as I'm having the exact same issue. I changed HDMI to USB-C cables connecting my MacBook to my tv/5.1 sound system and could only get stereo sound. All connections in the MIDI audio setup and VLC player are telling me 5.1 is enabled and yet only stereo plays.\nMy Denon receiver also confirms the existence of only a stereo connection on the display when. It is connected. So I assume my (rather expensive) new HDMI to USB cable is stereo only. It is this model. It doesn't specify the number of channels it supports so I think you're right in that being a smoking gun for a stereo-only signal.\n", "Q: What is the technical explanation for why Archive Utility can break certain apps, while other unarchivers won't? I just experienced this issue described in this answer.\nI had downloaded a zip file containing a macOS app, and first unzipped it with Archive Utility, when trying to open the app, I got the error that it \"could not be opened\" (with no further clarification) just like in the Q&A linked to above.\nHowever, when I used Keka (third party archive software) to unzip, the app worked just fine.\nWhat is the technical explanation for this? Aren't zips and other archives supposed to come out literally the same, byte for byte? How can one unarchiver break the app, but not the other?\nI use Catalina on an Intel Mac.\n\nA: The file attributes are not the data that's stored in files, it's the information stored in the file system. Different archiving utilities may interpret information differently. It's either:\na) File attributes before zipping are incorrect and (some) unzipping utility fixes it\nb) Unzipping utility has a bug.\nI checked the archive with tar utility (widely used and well know utility).

The MPA display seems to be identical to the display the MacBook Pro 2020 (13.3\") is using, which has an official maximum brightness level of 500 nits.\nSo it's clear that there is just an artificial max brightness limit on OS level for the MBA to further justify the higher price of the MBP. Now we just have to find the place where this limit is stored in the OS and how to adapt it. Did anyone look into that? This github project found out several undocumented settings already, but it doesn't seem to be able to change the upper limit.\n\nA: \nSo it's clear that there is just an artificial max brightness limit on OS level for the MBA to further justify the higher price of the MBP.\n\nNo, there's no limit in the OS per se, and it's not to \"justify a higher price.\"  macOS (Windows, Linux, whatever) doesn't control the max brightness of a display panel.  There is a physical limit of the panel and a physical limit imposed by the LED/CCFL driver chip (usually selected to match the brightness range of the panel).\nWhat, then, controls how bright a panel can go?\nIt's a device driver issue.\nThere is no setting in the OS whether it be macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, or Linux that you can modify to allow you increase the brightness of your display panel.  In fact, there is no direct link between the OS and the LED/LCD driver chip (not the device driver in the OS) as it is controlled by the GPU.  To make any changes to the output level of the driver (increased/decreased voltage for a brighter/dimmer panel), the OS must talk to the GPU through the device driver (kext) by sending instructions to the GPU which in turn instructs the LED/LCD driver chip to adjust its voltage output.\nThe values that define the range of 0% to 100% are calibrated to voltage  values and are hard coded into the driver.  Apple's hardware and software engineering teams have settled on a set of values that they deem as the optimal balance of usability and efficiency - looks good and maximizes battery life.  The folks at Microsoft did the same and came up with different numbers; thus the obvious visual difference.\nThe LED/LCD Driver Circuit\nBelow is a section of a MacBook Pro logic board block diagram (older board that used a CCFL backlight rather than the newer LED backlight, but the concept is the same) showing the physical interface of the GPU and the inverter that controls the brightness of the display panel.\n\nThe Driver Chip...\nTo understand this better, we need to look at the actual driver chip that regulates the output voltage that is sent to the display.\n\nIf we look at the HV9985 LED driver datasheet (selected this at random as Apple doesn't release schematics to know which exact driver is being used) we can see on the pin assignments there are relevant to how dimming the panel works:\n\n*\n\n*Pin 9 is the variable output (10V - 40V) that powers the panel backlight.  More voltage means brighter pannel, less means dimmer pannel.\n\n*Pin 10 handles the \"standby\" mode of the panel (puts it to sleep). When the voltage here goes below 0.8V, the panel goes to sleep (100% dim).\n\n*Pins 17-19 control the dimming of the panel by regulating the voltage using PWM (pulse-width modulation) - basically flipping a switch on/off really fast at a particular frequency to get the desired voltage out.\n\nWhile quite technical, what's important to note here is all of this is handled by the GPU.\nHow the OS talks to the GPU\nBelow is a block diagram of the macOS/OS X Operating System kernel architecture from Apple Developer Documentation.  The Mach kernel interfaces with hardware devices (GPU, USB controllers, SATA, PCIe, etc.) through kexts or kernel extensions.\n\nAs you can see, Drivers (kexts) are as low level within the kernel as you can get.  It's the display kext that has been hard coded with the values that (in this example, the LED driver's PWM range) will dim/brighten the display panel.  In Windows, it would be the device driver that is hardcoded with these values.\nThis range is hard coded and all the OS does when you select the the brightness level is send a command to the GPU that tells it to dim/brighten so many steps within that  range.  The driver then converts that to a command to the LED that changes the PWM value to change the output voltage.  All of this is handled way behind the scenes at a very low level.\nSo, referring back to the GitHub project, the line in the code\nfloat brightness = 0.8;\n\nonly sets the brightness to 80% of the maximum defined in the kext/driver, not 80% of the (physical) panel's maximum brightness. (Technically, it’s setting a variable of floating point type called “brightness” to a value of “.8”, it will eventually be passed to a function that sets the brightness to 80% of the maximum).\nTL;DR\nThere's no value or .plist that you can modify that will increase the brightness of your screen past what is defined within the kext/device driver for the GPU.    The Apple engineers hard coded the range of brightness (probably to balance usability and performance with battery life) into the kext so while macOS gives you a range from 1 to 10, the engineers at Microsoft apparently decided to set the range from 0 to 11.\nIf you want to modify these values in macOS, you'll need to write a custom kext for the GPU.\n", "Q: Battery not charging I think I went through all \"battery is not charging\" posts already.\n\n*\n\n*SMC Reset: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201295\n\n*Battery Health does not have a button \"Manage Battery Longevity\" https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211094\n\n*There is not \"charge to full now\" when clicking on the battery icon\n\n*I tried unplug/replug, reboot, searched all settings\n\nand yet:\n\nNone of the above worked.

My hunch is your adapter isn’t providing enough power for when the machine runs, but we will need some more data to conclude that (and that’s what Apple troubleshooting will also helo you determine).\n", "Q: How to hide all toolbars in Excel?

I'm trying to determine the battery health on an old MacBook Pro. Specs are: A1398 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), Model Identifier MacBookPro11,3, running macOS 11.5.2 (Big Sur).\nAccording to this Apple support page (note that the OS selector is correctly set to Big Sur), I can do that by going to: Apple menu > System Preferences > [Battery icon] > [Battery icon], at which point I'm supposed to see a button entitled Battery Health..., and I'm to click that. The image below (from this Tom's Guide article) shows what I should see:\n\nBut I don't. I see the following:\n\nAs you can see, it is very similar to the previous one, but a major difference is that the Battery Health... button simply isn't there.\nAny ideas why I'm seeing something different from what Apple says I should?\nAnd, more to the point, any ideas how I might determine my battery health?\n\nA: The Battery Health... button requires hardware support as well as being provided in macOS software. Older MacBooks do not have the hardware capability.\nFor example, my MacBook 2016 with macOS 12 does not show Battery Health and does not support Optimised Charging.\nBut you can find out about the battery health. The app coconutBattery does this. As well as showing current battery health it will keep a history for you.\nI am taking 'battery health' as the maximum charge capacity of battery now compared with nominal value when new.  Typically this will decline from 100% (or even a bit more) when new to around 80% when you should be considering a battery replacement.\nEdit (added, with thanks, from @AVelj's comment):\nFor alternative ways of getting battery health/condition, you can access this information from System Profiler>Hardware>Power and it should tell you what is the maximum charge of your MacBook. You could also run the command system_profiler SPPowerDataType in terminal to obtain this information.\n", "Q: How much longer does the M1-Max MacBook Pro battery last compared to the previous (non-M1-Max) model? How much longer the battery life of the most recent 16 inch MacBook Pro is relative to the next most recent 16 inch MacBook Pro (2019 model) under similar (preferably identical) work loads?\nWhat I already know: I find many sites with statistics for the two machines in isolation, but these aren't necessarily useful because many test the machines under different usage loads, hence they are not like-for-like comparisons. It's important that both machines be made to do very similar workloads during the comparisons.\n\nA: I think it's going to be very hard to get data on this unless you can find some Youtuber running battery tests on both models.** The nature of the tasks is also likely to be significant, given that the M1s have hardware dedicated to certain tasks.\nHowever, it is well known that the M1 CPUs are much more power-efficient than the old Intel CPUs -- indeed, the heat-generation on the Intels was one of the motivations for switching to the new architecture.\nIn short: the new M1 is going to be faster and last longer on battery for any given task than the old Intel MBP. How much so? Pffffffft.\n** Here's a thorough review of the two models, which includes battery performance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNMcMhFV0E4\n", "Q: How to determine which font is being used to render a specific character in Terminal Terminal is rendering 0x209A (a subscript \"p\") in a nice way when I use cat to look a file that contains that character.  Terminal has been configured to use Inconsolata as its default font, but I'm fairly confident Inconsolata doesn't have that code-point specifically. Indeed, if I use the \"Show emoji & symbols\" dropdown, the Unicode table doesn't list a font for that code-point at all.  But still, Terminal is doing a good job of showing me the character, and the tabular presentation in the dropdown does show it as well.  How do I find out what font is being used?\n\nA: Copy/paste it into TextEdit & see what font it switches to, or type 209A into the search box in the Emoji & Symbols viewer & use that to enter the character.\n\nDeja Vu is a common unicode replacement, as it a very comprehensive font.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of the padlock icon in Manage Backups? Following the discussion in this AskDifferent post (\"Is it safe to delete the contents of Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup if using iCloud?\"), on my MacOS machine with Catalina, the finder switched to the device management mode when I just connected any iPhone to my machine and clicked on the name of the iPhone in Locations on the left of the finder window. Then I was pleased to see that clicking on \"Manage Backups\" under this phone's information display brought up a window listing backups from multiple devices, not just this iPhone.\nHowever, I don't understand the meaning of the padlock icon next to one of the devices in the list. In fact, this was the one I wanted to delete, and I could proceed to delete the backup for this device, despite the padlock being shown. So then, what does the padlock icon signify, in this context? In the screenshot below, I circled the padlock icon in red.\n\n\nA: The lock sign indicates that the backup is encrypted and protected by a password set previously against an unauthorized restoration of it to an iPhone. That is, you need to know the password for that backup to be restored to an iPhone if and when necessary. You don't need to know the password, however, to remove the backup as you also indicated.\nSee this Apple Support article titled \"About encrypted backups on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\" for more details.\n", "Q: How do you disable Command + Tab (App switcher) in Monterey so that window switcher shortcuts from other applications can replace it?

Recent iPad models featuring USB-C or Thunderbolt connectors allows you to connect a display without using an adapter.\nAs for the touch digitizer, it is possible to connect it using the USB protocol to for example a recent iPad having a USB-C connector. Realistically you want to use a USB-C dongle/dock that allows you to have USB in (for the touch digitizer), DisplayPort/HDMI out (for the external display) and power in (for charging the iPad).\nYou could create a custom case that holds the iPad, has the cable connected to the iPad, an adapter/dongle/dock, and an external screen featuring an appropriate interface (HDMI, USB-C/DisplayPort, depending on iPad model) and USB touch-digitizer. Such a custom case would most probably be quite large.\nYou cannot connect a larger screen to the internal display connector inside the iPad, unless that larger screen has been made explicitly for the purpose of being connected to that connector. As far as I know, such a display does not exist. Note that even such a larger display could only be physically larger - it cannot have a larger resolution than the original iPad display.\n", "Q: Automatic updates of Safari Extensions prompting to quit Safari Using Safari 15, every morning I open up my Mac and see alert(s) that an extension is trying to reboot Safari:\n\n\nClose \"Safari\" to Update\nClick Continue to quit \"Safari\" and finish updating \"ExtensionName\".\n\nAfter clicking \"Cancel\", the exact same alert then pops up for every other individual extension that want's to update.\nHow can I prevent these alerts?

Safari retains state, so you don’t lose your tabs and items for these updates in my experience.\n", "Q: iPhone private MAC address not working? 2 MAC addresses appear in my router I just connected my iPhone to a brand new router and saw that 2 new MAC addresses appeared in connected devices.\nBy disabling the \"Private address\" feature I could verify that both MAC addresses belong to my iPhone.\nI understand that this is a privacy feature, but what's the point if my hardware address shows up anyway?\nThis was my first time connecting to this network and the private address feature is enabled by default.\nI have tested this on 2 routers, same thing with this iPhone. However, when using an Android device with the private address feature, only the spoofed MAC appears in my devices list.\nWonder if this just happens to me or also to others. And, more important: How can I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: The point of randomizing MAC address is so that each router you connect to around town doesn’t get to know your device and sell your data to track you trivially. You will have to erase all history of Mac addresses on your router in a factory reset and be sure you enable privacy before connecting to test this on basic routers.\nImagine you had a bank that would give you new credit card numbers for each merchant. Then you would know which merchant had a breach and. It have to change the others.\nI would ask a second follow on question for your router not working (it depends more on the router details - none of which are documented in your question). At home, you don’t have to worry as much about being “known” to “your router” so I would disable this feature for that network if you don’t want to hassle with configuring your router configuration to work well with this privacy option.

Perhaps use Cmd-dot to toggle back and forth.\nIf you have a numeric keypad, you could program some of those keys with different navigation outputs.  Or function keys.\nI use mostly TextEdit.  I’ll get some downvotes for having the audacity to suggest it’s not completely useless.  Other editors are available that do a lot more.  But there’s some value in choosing a simpler product that does everything you need over one that can do a lot of things you don’t need.

I didn't do this; I suspect something is messing with the volume but I don't know what. I always keep the speaker volume all the way down.\nHere are my suspicions:\n\n*\n\n*It seems to only happen when I'm using a bluetooth headset (AirPods) and I swap between different devices (iPhone and MacBook).\n\n*I mostly listen to Spotify.\n\n*An example: I'm listening to Spotify on my MacBook through AirPods meanwhile I'm doing something on my phone, then randomly I see the volume control slide in from the side at 100% as if I had pressed the volume up button.\n\n*The volume buttons on the side of my phone aren't broken. I really don't think this is the issue.\n\nI think Spotify might be hijacking the iPhone volume control when listening across different devices. If so, why is it doing this and can I stop it from doing that? Is there a permission or something I can revoke to prevent Spotify from doing that?\niPhone 11, iOS 15.1\n\nA: It's probably Spotify's fault.\nWhen you have multiple devices logged in to Spotify, you can play music on one device and control it from another device (Spotify Conntect). For example if I'm playing music on my MacBook, I can open Spotify on my iPhone and it'll show what song is currently playing on my other device. Spotify hijacks the iPhone volume to control the Spotify volume on the other device which is usually always at 100% which is why my iPhone volume gets set to 100% also.\nThe problem is when I close Spotify on my other device, the volume on my iPhone doesn't reset so I'm left with 100%.\nIt seems Spotify Connect cannot be turned off, but I can disable at least some functionality by going into Settings > Devices > turn off Devices Lock Screen.\n", "Q: What is System Data Storage I've checked my iPad storage and I see the System Data storage is taking up too much space. I know it contains any needed system data and caches. How do I delete these caches in system data storage?\niPad Air 2\niPadOS 15.1\n\nA: System storage contains core system files that are necessary for your iPhone to function and also some temporary cache files. There isn't any easy way to delete these cache files. You can try deleting your Safari history & website data and restarting your phone to clean some of the cache files. Occasionally (I do it once a year), I make a backup of iPhone data and reset it. This might take some time to do but certainly deletes a lot of the cache files and make your phone storage as it would be out of box.\n", "Q: What's the actual, proper way to transfer uncompressed photos from iOS? As far as I can tell, iOS does some really strange things when it comes to compressing the media in your Photos app.\nIt seems that any time you use the \"share\" sheet, it's compressing your photos slightly, even when using AirDrop.  Comparing a photo transferred via Airdrop to one transferred via copy/pasting in Windows Explorer, there's a fairly significant file size difference (2.98MB vs 3.75MB).  At first I thought this may be due to some sort of lossless compression, but then I compared some videos, and the actual bitrate on the video streams differed when transferred via USB vs any other app or Airdrop (12mbps vs 14mbps).\n~~Going to the settings app and changing the \"Transfer to PC or Mac\" setting to \"Keep Originals\" under the photos section makes no difference.~~\nEDIT: It absolutely does, see my answer below.\nAs far as I can tell, transferring via USB to a Windows PC is the only way to do it. But...this can't be the only way, right?  There should be a proper way to do it within the Apple ecosystem.  But yet, MacOS won't even entertain the idea of letting you transfer photos via USB lightning cable as long as you have iCloud photos enabled.  And iCloud photos' option of downloading the \"unmodified original\" from the web app is a complete misnomer, as a 3.75MB photo comes down as 1.95MB, and full HD videos actually come down in 720p.\nAnyone with any insight as to how iOS's compression system works would really help me out here.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Alright, it seems I've made a bit of a deduction mistake - turns out changing \"Automatic\" to \"Keep Originals\" under Photos in the Settings app makes all the difference.  Depending on which option is checked, the files will show up differently in Windows Explorer.\n\n\"Automatic\" makes them show up as .jpg files.  \"Keep Originals\" makes the photos show up as HEIC files.  That's the reason for the size difference (.heic files are much smaller).\n\nA: There is a way to transfer photo files from the iOS device to your MacOS device by way of running the Image Capture app from the MacOS device. This application has import by selection or Import All functionality. It copies all the metadata for the image files as well including the creation and modification dates of the original file present on the iOS device.\n\nThe last section in this support page covers a bit about the compression\n\nImporting this media via USB\nWhen you import HEIF or HEVC media from an attached iOS device to Photos, Image Capture, or a PC, the media might be converted to JPEG or H.264.\nYou can change this import behavior in iOS 11 or later. Go to Settings > Photos. In the TRANSFER TO MAC OR PC section, tap Keep Originals to prevent the media from being converted to JPEG or H.264 when importing.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207022\n\n", "Q: How can I generate multiple hashes in Mac terminal for multiple files?

If you can’t get the google drive service to work reliably, paying for one month of iCloud would get the job done without needing a computer.\nWe also use Finder to sync files, many more than that so I don’t see any issues inherent with the OS or design since this is small size of files to sync for the work population I support.

Just do it from the terminal:\nCreate a Folder\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/Name_of_the_TM_Save/My_Folder\n\nThen unhide this folder\nsudo chflags -R nohidden /Volumes/Name_of_the_TM_Save/My_Folder\n\nThen you appropriate it:\nsudo chown -R your_name:staff /Volumes/Name_of_the_TM_Save/My_Folder\n\nAnd that's all.\nBut what can be the interest ?????\nAnd the risk of \"breaking\" Time Machine.\nThe best solution is as @Tetsujin indicates to create if necessary a new volume in the APFS container supporting the TM backup.\n\nA: One usage scenario that led me to your post is a shucked WD drive on which I cannot seem to disable \"intelligent\" head parking, and that goes nuts in my external enclosure spinning down and spinning up. I do not need the storage space from a second partition, so just want to use an app, Amphetamine, to write to the drive periodically to keep it from spinning down then right back up. The question of whether this will \"break\" TM is an interesting one. My backup is brand new, so if something goes wrong, I'll report back.\n", "Q: How does iOS compress photos when transferring to a PC or Mac? There is a setting in the \"Photos\" menu of the settings app that allows you to change the way that photos are transferred from iOS devices.\n\nWhen you choose \"Automatic\" then plug your phone into a Windows PC, all of your photos show up as .jpg files in Windows Explorer.  They can then be copy/pasted to any other folder.  When you choose \"Keep Originals\", all your photos show up as .HEIC files, and they are significantly smaller.\n\nMy question is, what's happening here?  It can't possibly be the case that iOS is transcoding every single piece of media on your iPhone the second you plug it into a PC.  Does iOS store two different versions of every single photo?  Or does it transcode them during the transfer process, and somehow estimate what the file size will be in order to show them properly in an alias sort of way in Windows explorer as JPGs?\nAnd furthermore, as far as quality loss is concerned in terms of compression, which file format is higher quality?  Are they both \"first generation\"?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When you import these photos over USB as JPEGs they will be transcoded as they're transferred. This means that photos are not stored twice on the phone in two different formats, and they're also not all batch-converted as soon as you plug in the device.\nIn this particular case, you definitely want to download the .HEIC file. Even though it is smaller, it is actually the file format that the photo is stored in on the phone. If you choose to download as .JPEG then the quality is most probably worse (and never better) - even though the file size might be larger. Every transcode of a file to a lossy format (such as JPEG) comes with a loss of quality - therefore you want to avoid such transcodes for getting the best possible quality.\n", "Q: Is it possible to backup a disk on a Windows shared folder? I connected to Windows 10 shared folder:\n\nchecked that it is writable by creating a file and tried to backup a disk into the that shared folder, but with no success:\n\nwhat can be wrong with the permissions?\nFolder info:\n\nEDIT1:\nCreated and mounted HFS+ disk, but TimeMachine does not allow to select it:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\ndoes not help.\n\nA: Actually I have done this with a TimeMachine, to a shared NTFS formatted drive. It's been a few years but this should still work. EG pardon the 100 foot view, I don't remember all the details.\nShare the drive (or a folder on the drive, which I did) on Windows and give a username you can share with the Mac backup app. Give that user CHANGE permission on the share.\nThen you create a sparse image on the Mac, mount the image once created and format it appropriately (at the time it was HFS+ only) on the Mac and then copy the DMG you just created and formatted to the share on the Windows PC/Server.\nmacOS can't write to a directly attached NTFS drive natively without 3rd party software, but it can write to an SMB share, regardless of the filesystem.\nThe DMG is required so you don't lose the APFS/HFS+ extended attributes that NTFS does'nt really support. And if you are using TimeMachine it HAS to back up to HFS+, or for more recent macOS versions APFS.\nSo in reality you are not backing up directly to NTFS but a Mac filesystem on an NTFS share.\n", "Q: How do I choose the Agree button in the macOS Monterey licence agreement dialog without using a mouse? I’m trying to reinstall macOS Monterey.\nUnfortunately, for whatever reason, they have decided that the mouse won’t work during the reinstall process. The pointer appears on screen but the mouse doesn’t move it. The mouse has been charged so I’m assuming that this is just a thing.\nSo anyway, a couple of screens into the install, the software licence agreement dialog has come up.\n\nQuestion: How do I press Agree on this dialog?\nI can scroll the text with the arrow keys, but neither Tab nor Shift-Tab move to the button panel below.\nI can get to the main menu with fn-Ctrl-F2 but there is barely anything in it. I can also get to the keyboard input selector in the top right with fn-Ctrl-F8. (I was looking for some way to turn on more accessibility options.)\nI am assuming there is some way for me to press this button, if Monterey really is the big improvement in accessibility that it was marketed as. In my case the mouse may not be getting paired as expected but in someone else’s case they may be unable to use a mouse at all.\n\nA: This is not an intentional thing, but when the pairing records can’t be retrieved from a keychain, you will need a physical keyboard and mouse to self-rescue here. Setting up remote access to recovery isn’t worth the time for most situations.\n\nA: Press return. If that doesn't work, try tab + return\n", "Q: Previewing image and video with the spacebar does not work anymore? \nWhen I press the spacebar on images or videos, my mac used to show me the actual size of the pictures or and videos.

I've entered everything correctly, hoping to show SMTP setting. But instead, it shows incorrect username and password, even also got stuck in the loading screen. I've entered the app specific password, correct imap server, correct user name based on Mail server settings for iCloud email clients.\n\n\n\nA: If you simply want iCloud in gmail, the app allows a much simpler way of doing this. When adding a new account, just click the iCloud button instead of IMAP.\n\nThen, enter your Apple ID, and go to appleid.apple.com and create an app-specific password (see this guide). Then enter that app-specific password into gmail, and that’s it (no servers, config, etcetera).\nI think your IMAP method would work with an app-specific password, but the way stated above is much simpler.\n", "Q: Reset Messages window size and position to factory default in macOS Big Sur How do I reset Messages's window size and position to its factory default in macOS Big Sur?

At the time of uploading, 'Always download music' (Settings > Music Automatic Downloads) wasn't turned on, and I have to go through all the newly added songs and download them manually on the iPhone, because the songs were not downloading.\nIs there a way to make my all music library offline on iOS 15 (without downloading them manually one after another)?\n\nA: You could make a playlist containing all music and click on download there. This way, you still have to add them all manually to this playlist, but it's a lot less taps adding them while creating the playlist.\n\nA: The Apple Music setting 'always download music' is a setting specific to the Music app, and is not related to any attached devices. This setting instructs Apple Music to download any music files you have added to your library from other devices. For example, you may have downloaded a song from your iPhone earlier to listen to it, so this setting instructs Apple Music on your Mac to also download that same song.\nIf you wish to download music to your iPhone, you need to first attach your iPhone to your Mac. This is easiest done by using your charging cable. With Apple Music open, simply plug in your iPhone, and the iPhone will display within a 'Devices' section of Apple Music. Click on that device and you will see a 'Sync Settings' button.  Clicking that button will bring up several other options. Scroll down to the section called 'Options':\n\nFrom here, the Options 'Automatically sync when this iPhone/iPad is connected' should be selected. You may also wish to select 'Show this iPhone/iPad when on Wi-Fi' so that you no longer need to attach the device to your Mac.\nA caveat: If you are using iCloud Music, your device will sync instead to iCloud music, not your Mac. You may need disable iCloud music sync on your iPhone to be able to sync from your Mac. Of course, you can have iCloud Music on with your Mac, then any downloads you do from the Mac will sync to the iPhone.\n", "Q: imagick.so.so after brew update + php.ini \"imagick.so\" instead of imagick.so I did a brew upgrade\nI have php 8.1 on osx 12.x\nImagick is not working\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'imagick.so' (tried: /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so (dlopen(/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so, 0x0009): tried: '/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/imagick.so' (no such file), '/usr/lib/imagick.so' (no such file)), /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so (dlopen(/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so, 0x0009): tried: '/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/imagick.so.so' (no such file), '/usr/lib/imagick.so.so' (no such file))) in Unknown on line 0\n\nWarning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'imagick.so' (tried: /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so (dlopen(/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so, 0x0009): tried: '/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/imagick.so' (no such file), '/usr/lib/imagick.so' (no such file)), /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so (dlopen(/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so, 0x0009): tried: '/usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so.so' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/imagick.so.so' (no such file), '/usr/lib/imagick.so.so' (no such file))) in Unknown on line 0\nConfiguration File (php.ini) Path: /usr/local/etc/php/8.1\nLoaded Configuration File:         /usr/local/etc/php/8.1/php.ini\nScan for additional .ini files in: /usr/local/etc/php/8.1/conf.d\nAdditional .ini files parsed:      /usr/local/etc/php/8.1/conf.d/ext-opcache.ini\n\nMy thinking is the relevant error is about /usr/local/lib/imagick.so.so and I have a file /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/imagick.so that might be better to link against.\n\n*\n\n*I also noticed that inside my php.ini I got extension=\"imagick.so\" which I renamed extension=imagick.so\n\n*if I ls /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/20210902/ I get no file\nnow if I ls /usr/local/lib/php/pecl/ then use autocompletion to finish 20210902 I get imagick.so\nI tried making a symlink in /usr/local/lib/ but it does not work.

Let's say I have mydoc.pdf displayed on screen (in Skim) and I minimize it just for a moment to access some other document or app. When I click on Skim icon in the dock to display mydoc.pdf back, inevitably it opens some other pdf document minimized much earlier instead (because usually I have multiple pdfs minimized in Skim). Is there any way to fix it?\nWhat is the \"right\" way of doing it? Not minimizing any apps and using cmd-tab or the dock to access another program when needed? (I find keeping all windows open messy, but it just me.)\n\nA: Hide the app instead of minimizing.\nWhile in Skim, press ⌘+h on the keyboard.  This hides all non-minimized windows of the active application.  When you go back (⌘+Tab or clicking in the dock) it returns to where you were last.\nFWIW - You can get here the long way by clicking the Skim menu from the menu bar, next to the  menu, and choose \"Hide Skim\".\nAdditionally, if you just want to jump to the desktop very quickly you can leverage gestures by \"Spread with thumb and three fingers\" on the trackpad.

You can't actually apply \"shrink to fit\" to text boxes, but you certainly can to  shapes.  If I paste a blob of text (e.g. \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\" as a label to a rectangle w/ \"shrink to fit\" toggled it'll auto-size down to minuscule when dragging a shape handle as desired.

Verified using FSMonitor.\n\n\n*Yes, it will depend on the application being used. There is no common preference for Safari, a download manager, or wget.\n\n\n*It is pretty useless way of preserving it. Most of the activity on the boot/system SSD is apps, preferences, system services - nearly everything uses that SSD and all day long.\nFor a while I had my ~/Downloads on an external SSD, but realised this was stupid as most downloads need to be copied (slower than moving) to /Applications or ~/Documents which are on my internal SSD.\nMy internal 512GB SSD is nearly 3 years old and still has 96% of its life remaining - measured via its SMART values.

This implementation supports that option; however, its use is strongly\ndiscouraged, as it does not correctly copy special files, symbolic\nlinks, or fifo's.\n\n(use -R instead)\n\nA: The answer to this is rsync. Not just to do the copy as @nohillside suggests but it can be setup to do just a verification.\nNormally I would say you need to get a newer version of rsync than macOS provides as the macOS one does not keep extended attributes but as cloud synchronizers don't either then that will not matter.\nYou can run rsync to do a dry-run, that is not to copy any files but just report the differences. The command is\nrsync --dry-run -av pcloud-dir/ gdrive-dir/\n\nA copy can be done by removing --dry-run\nThis has another advantage over Finder in that if the copy is interrupted then you can just repeat the same command and it will not recopy the files already done.\n", "Q: How can I tell if someone copied files off of my Internal HDD? I sent my laptop to replace my old HDD with a new SSD and  the person doing the repair kept the HDD with him for many months after putting the SSD in. Is there a way to find out if my files have been copied in any way or was the drive cloned? I have opened the HDD and checked what was in there, but there are still some sub folders that I didn't touch so considering that is there anything that I can do that will show logs of where my HDD was plugged in? or was any file or folder accessed. Some kind of Github software would be good. And it's been quite a few months since this event and also the HDD was in AFPS format and the HDD is the exact same which was working as internal storage in my macbook pro no changes in that. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: There is no way to tell if your drive was accessed reliably. There may be indications that the drive was accessed, but the absence of these indicators does not mean that the drive was not accessed.\nIf a drive is mounted read-only or simply cloned, no information gets written back to the disk. Thus, you won't be able to find any differences (apart from SMART information, but you would need to know the exact characteristics before the drive was given to someone else).\nAdditionally, since you apparently already accessed the drive in read-write mode, you cannot tell whether timestamps etc. were modified by the other person: it might have been your system (without you realizing it). So unless you find new data of which you can tell with 100% certainty that it was not coming from your system, you're not going to be able to tell whether the other person has accessed your drive.\n", "Q: System Preferences can't alter Files and Folders I am trying to set some privileges for apps to access folders using System Preferences->Security & Privacy and choosing Files and Folders.\nHowever clicking on the buttons for an app has no effect and the + and - icons are greyed out.

I have a footnote in a Pages document that I want to span across multiple pages. I essentially want the footnote to continue in the footnote margin on the next page, or possibly take up a whole page itself (it's a very large footnote).\nWhat I want to do is essentially similar to this: http://blog.vlbteched.com/creating-footnote-continuation-notice/\nHowever, I'm not even sure how to create a continuation notice for the footnote like you can do in Microsoft Word.\nHere are some other examples of essentially what I want to do:\n\n*\n\n*https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/194087/automatic-insertion-of-contd-when-footnote-splits-across-pages\n\n*https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/297825/how-can-i-break-big-footnotes-using-an-automatic-continued-sign\nI simply see no way to span a footnote across more than one page in my Pages document. When I reach the limit for the footnote on the current page, all the text I type afterwards seems to simply go \"underneath\" the bottom of the page, into some invisible \"void\". How can I make it so that the rest of the footnote can actually be visible on the next page(s) in the document?\n\nA: I managed to find a hacky workaround for this problem. I found out that you can \"piggyback\" on another footnote on the next page by inserting whitespace above the footnote number. Then, you can type a number above it and make the number superscript and write something like:\n\n20 (footnote cont'd) footnote from previous page continues here...\n(this isn't an actual footnote, just some text which I changed the\nfont for, and inserted above the below footnote)\n21 new footnote begins here (this is an actual footnote which is\nlinked to some text on the page)\n\nThis won't work for pages where there's not already a footnote there, but it worked in my case. Also, you'll still run into the problem of footnotes having a maximum length on a given page, but I was lucky enough to have two footnotes in short succession, so it was able to run across two pages, leaving only a single line at the bottom for the real footnote on the second page.\nAgain, this was not ideal, but it was a hacky workaround that happened to work for my situation.\n", "Q: Filemaker How to Import into related tables I recently purchased FileMaker Pro and created a new database with the \"Contact\" template.   I have a CSV file with Names, addresses and phone numbers.  When I choose import, the dialog only allows me to import fields that go into the 'Contacts' table. How do I get the address and phone number into the related address and phone tables?  I read in  the support docs that you can only import into 1 table at a time, but provides no details on how to choose the related table.\n\nA: That FMP Contacts template disables importing into the Addresses, Phone Numbers, and Email Addresses tables. The Contacts table auto-creates each record's primary key, which is used as the foreign key in the other three tables to relate them back to Contacts. Doesn't seem set up for bulk imports. Depending on your database-foo, you could try an FMP script as others have suggested. Another possible way: 1. Import what you can into Contacts. 2. Then Export all those records including each one's newly generated Primary Key. 3. In your original CMS if possible, import those new key IDs to the records where the phone numbers etc are. 4. Go back to FMP's Contacts, and create a new layout for each of the three tables. 5. Browse one of those new layouts, say Addresses, and then use the Import Data command. 6. When designating which CMS fields go to which FMP fields, set that new key id to go in the new table's Foreign Key field. 7. Repeat for the other two tables. NOTE that most of the fields in those three tables are automated, so ignore importing to them. I haven't tried this - keep a clean copy of your original CMS.\n\nA: Yes, You can import into only 1 table at a time.\nYou can try different approaches,\nOption 1. If you have a unique field (ID or similar) in the CSV file, you can import relevant fields into Contact first and then into Address table in next import and use the ID field to link them.\nOption 2. Import the file into a staging table. Then write a script to move them to appropriate tables.\n\nA: The way I do it usually: A script imports CSV in a global text field. Within a loop it generates new records, sets the field values after decoding of the global text with the \"Middle\" command according to the separating text delimiters (semicolon or tab).\n", "Q: PTP Mount iphone on macOS BigSur On Windows, it is super easy to mount an iPhone via PTP.\nPicture Transfer Protocol \n\nIt is recognized as a \"Camera\".\nThis shows the iPhone as Drive in Explorer and gives access to all pictures.\nGoals:\n\n*\n\n*No Use of 3rd Party Tools\n\n*No Use of Apps (Photos, ImageCapture...)\n\nHow can this PTP mount be done on Mac (BigSur and above)?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not working on macOS, as like Tetsujin said, the mounting mechanism is working completely different.\n", "Q: How to *permanently* set OSX to the default boot drive when using a Bootcamp partition?

I then reset it to OSX when I'm back in OSX, but it's getting annoying.\nIs there any way to prevent windows from resetting it all the time?  I've tried setting the default boot drive from within Windows, but Windows doesn't see the OSX partition, so I can't.\n\nA: When macOS is missing from the Windows Boot Camp Control Panel, macOS is usually installed in a APFS container. Since you did not specify this information, I will make this assumption. Originally, this was a problem when APFS was first introduced, but since then Apple has released updates to Boot Camp to fix this problem. Any such updates can be downloaded by executing \"Apple Software Update\" from Windows.\n\nNote: If \"Apple Software Update\" shows an update for \"Apple Software Update\", you probably should download and install this update first. This may happen more than once.\n\nIn the event there is no Boot Camp update available to fix your problem, then you could use the solution that was posted here at Ask Different four years ago. The idea was to add a small partition that Boot Camp installed in Windows would detect as macOS and thus could be selected from the Windows Boot Camp Control Panel or from the right side of the Windows taskbar. You would have to install into this partition and configure a free third party boot manager call rEFInd. The full instructions are given in this answer.

The accounts I'm logged in within the app are displayed on the first screen of the app. For some reason this data is still there after removing and reinstalling the app.\nSince iOS warns me that \"Deleting this app will also delete its data.\" I believe this shouldn't be the case.\nThings I've tried to permanently get rid of the app data and start with a clean slate:\n\n*\n\n*Removing the app, then reinstalling.\n\n*Rebooting between these steps.\n\n*Turning off the backup for the app in Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups > device, and switching the backup off for the app.\n\n*Rebooting after this.\n\n*Forcing a backup after this.\n\n*Removing the whole backup for the device, and turning backup off.\n\n*Removing backup of other devices (that had the account logged in).\n\n*Hiding the app purchase in the App Store and repurchasing it.\n\n*Restarting before installing again.\n\n*There is no iCloud Drive directory for the app.\n\n*I couldn't find related entry in the iCloud Keychain.\n\nOn a new iOS device under my Apple ID I can install this app and the account is not there.

After an account name/email/password change the old account name is stuck and it doesn't let me log in with the new details.\nI can't get rid of some app data and it activates a bug in the app. But anyways I believe this shouldn't be happening and is a bug with iOS.\nHow can I get rid of the app data permanently? Is there a local keychain that I couldn't view or edit?\niOS version: 15.1 on iPhone 11 Pro, and iPad Air 4\n\nA: The information you mention is stored in the Keychain. The Keychain is first and foremost stored locally on the device, but it can also be synced across devices using the iCloud Keychain feature.\nThere's no viewer on the iPhone for showing you what's in the Keychain, besides the information shown to you by the original app developer (i.e. the view you mention inside Duolingo in this case).\nThere's really no Apple-provided way of deleting individual pieces of information from the keychain. So unless the Duolingo developers provide you with that option, it is practically possible.\nInstead you can delete the whole Keychain from the phone by erasing all contents and settings on the device. That is a quite destructive option unfortunately.\nFor a practical solution, I would contact Duolingo support to see if they can help you in getting the issue with the changed account name resolved.\n", "Q: Is there a way to open tabs in the background? I don't want new tabs grabbing focus I often like to open several folders in new tabs, but keep the focus on the parent folder I'm selecting from. My ADHD brain gets distracted by the OS auto-switching the focus to the latest new tab This constantly breaks my train of thought because the system keeps wiping away the list I am concentrating on.\nAre there any modifier keys or right-click options to open new tab in background?\n\nA: I don't think you can have exactly what you want (without purchasing some tool with that capability), however, if your Finder preference for 'open folders in tabs instead of new windows' is checked, then you can open selected folders in new tabs with command-option-o. At least, you can in Sierra.\nNote that it won't happen in the background as the last item selected will become the active tab in the window. However, your original selection will be maintained in the initial tab.\n", "Q: Is there a way to go forward in Finder like in a web browser? Sometimes I am using Finder and I want to go back a folder. Then when I'm done doing what I wanted to do in that folder I want to go forward to the subfolder I was previously in. But it seems the Back/Forward button doesn't do this. Back of course takes you up a directory, which makes sense. But when I go forward, I want to go forward to the folder I was previously in. It seems though, that Forward is only for after you've selected a folder to go into. And then it takes you into that one. But if you selected the folder with a mouse, why not just double-click to enter the folder right away? And if you selected the folder with the keyboard, why not just enter it using CmdO? I don't know anybody who would click on a folder just to select it, and then use a separate button to enter it.\nWhat's worse - if no folder is selected to go forward to when you click Forward, it instead takes you back!\n\nI'm used to going forward and backward through my viewing history in web browsers, so out of habit I sometimes try to go forward in Finder and get sent up a directory instead. I thought the button was buggy, until I realized it's expecting a folder to be selected.\nJust to clarify: Going forward into a folder that is selected is logical. But going back because no folder is selected, is illogical. So in that case I would want to be taken forward to the subfolder I was in prior to the current one. Or if I wasn't in any of the subfolders before the current one, I would want the Forward button to do nothing (except maybe blink on the click event, as user-feedback). But being sent back up a directory when clicking Forward is weird to me. (Is it just me?)\nI checked the options in the Customize Toolbar menu, but there aren't any alternative navigation buttons for taking you through the folder history. I considered removing the Forward button altogether, so at least I wouldn't accidentally click it, but Forward and Back are inseparable, as a single item. Is there any way to modify the functionality?\n\nA: cmd ⌘+] and cmd ⌘+[ can used for backward and forward for finder\n", "Q: Best type of disk image to use on NAS to archive Mac system copies on a NAS I bought a shiny new NAS with plenty of space. I also have quit a few old pysical external hard drives with bootable macOS system copies: I always make a copy of my system which I store away when I upgrade my macOS version. So I have Leopard, Lion, Mavericks and El Capitan drives...\nNow I want to declutter, but still keep the data \"just in case\". So I though I create disk images on the NAS and copy the mirrored systems over (with Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper). - And in case I really need them again I restore them back to a drive and can hopefully boot them up again. Here my question:\nWhat is the best type of disk image to use: Sparse bundle, sparse image, or fixed disk image?\nI want as much reliability as possible and I'm not planning to write to the images after copying.\n\nA: For archival images, I'd use the \"compressed\" format (which I think you'd consider \"fixed\", but it's one of a number of fixed-size formats). The sparse formats are useful for when you want the image to be able to expand later, when you add to them... which is pretty irrelevant for archived systems. There's also a fixed-size read-write format, and a read-only (uncompressed) format, which'll store the same thing, but take up more space for no good reason.\nAll the versions you mention will be in HFS+ (aka Mac OS Extended) format. In my experience, the best way to image an HFS+ volume is to mount it (note: don't try to image the volume you're running from at the time), open Disk Utility, choose File menu > New Image > Image from Folder, and select the top level of the volume as the \"folder\" to image. In the save dialog, make sure Image Format is set to Compressed, and it's best to save it somewhere local (and copy it to the NAS afterward). Once it's finished, choose Images > Scan Image for Restore, and have that process the newly-created image. Then copy it to the NAS.\nWhy image \"from Folder\" rather than from the device? Because it creates a cleaner image (files all defragmented, etc) but preserves everything that matters (i.e. if the original was bootable, you can restore the image and the result will be bootable). It also makes the image just big enough for the files, since it doesn't include all the empty space in the original volume. Including the empty space can cause trouble if you ever need to restore it to a smaller volume.\nWhy \"Scan Image for Restore\"? So you can use Disk Utility's Restore feature to restore it to a disk later (or use the command-line asr tool to do the same thing). You could do the scan process later, but I prefer to do it immediately, so the image'll be ready to go if I ever need it.\n\nA: The simplest option is often also the most reliable - I would use a simple bit-for-bit identical copy (perhaps this is what you call a \"fixed disk image\").\nSuch an image can be written back to the physical hard drive again and be able to boot up. You'll also be able to mount the file system inside the image as a virtual, read-only drive in order to inspect and copy files.\n", "Q: How to upgrade from Yosemite to Monterey? I have a Macbook Air, early 2014, running Yosemite. I went to the App Store, looked for Monterey, didn't find it, got a link somewhere else and finally found it. Yet, when I try to install it, it says my machine is incompatible with Monterey. Yosemite is unusable due to outdated apps, lack of TLS certificates etc. What could I do?\n\nA: Indeed, Monterey is not compatible with my Macbook Air, but Big Sur is and should be enough for our needs.\nHere is how I installed it:\n\n*\n\n*I found this page in Apple support. It has links to hidden versions of macOS and shows the compatibility between the versions.

I am researching on how to debug the his adapter. Ethernet lights blink but I don’t know enough about this early FireWire.\nWith a simple Netgear four ports switch-hub, when connecting via RJ45 cables osx boxes and Linux boxes and seting static ip addresses, one is able to arping but not ping to/fro different operational systems. Why is that, please?\nI can see routes to the Linux boxes on osx netstat -r. But pings from osx to linux timesout. Same goes for linux pinging OSX. Arp tables are correct and were updated automatically not manually.\nTen years ago someone asked the same and did not get an answer:\nWhich setting in osx could block \"ping localhost\"?\nIn my case, no, OS X firewall is NOT in stealth mode and it’s not even running. I have turned it off to do the experiment.\nThis has been posted on Mac Support website: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253430208\n\nA: On this Mac OSX, there was the setting \"Always Require VPN\" on MullvadVPN application.\nThis setting is extremely desirable when on the internet filtering ads and keeping privacy and security, and it is great that it works well. The app changes very deep OSX configurations and the user has no network if not connected to the VPN. This is to avoid leaks. To guarantee no request will go through another socket. It also cuts the internet if the VPN connection is interrupted and the user has to wait until it's reestablished. Even if the app is killed, one will not be able to request anything via sockets other than the VPN.\nIt's a great setting, but it does not allow one to connect to a service running on the own machine, or a Minikube cluster, or in this case above, a simple ethernet connection with no DHCP or any complication.\nLessons learned on the way to troubleshoot problems like this:\n\n*\n\n*When ping fails, the result from arp -a can help troubleshooting. OSX will display a question mark as domain name if cut from networking.\n\n    ~ $ arp -a\n    ?

If the switch lights blink, ether is okay. In any case, I found the below resource for FireWire 2 problems that might help people.\nhttp://www.thexlab.com/faqs/firewiretroubleshooting.html\n\n\n*OSX Firewall does not block ping in or out. When the VPN was out, all worked with the Firewall on block-all.\n", "Q: How can I get macOS to tell me what chroma sampling or subsampling is being used on an external display on an M1 mac? After receiving my MacBookPro18,4 (i.e. MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)) with an M1 Max chip and seeing the ProMotion display, I was hooked on high (>60Hz) refresh rates, and treated myself to a LG 38WN95C-W for an external display.\nVery pleased with 3840x1600@144Hz except that sometimes red text on a black background or white text on a red background would look eye-strainingly blurry and awful, with weird dark fringing around the edges. After playing with the settings, I discovered that the likely cause was Chroma subsampling; specifically that it was likely that my single Thunderbolt connection was not high-bandwidth enough to drive the display at 144Hz.  I stepped it down to 120Hz (which is really all I was looking for anyway, although 60Hz→120Hz is very noticeable, 120Hz→144Hz is barely perceptible, at least to me) and now the fringing seems to be gone.\nHowever, I would really like to know if any subsampling is still occurring, and in particular I'd like to be able to experiment with different configurations (is it my dock? my cable? the display interface; i.e. does DisplayPort work better? can I get 144Hz anywhere or is 120 the max without this?) without having to look at subpixels in the iOS magnifier app to determine if compression is still happening.\nI've looked at the output of system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType and AGDCDiagnose, but the former doesn't show me a Y'CrCb value and the latter only works on Intel chips.\nUpdate 2022-03-22: I got a new CalDigit TS4 Dock and, wondering if the higher bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4 would result in less chroma compression, I took a look at 144Hz running through it. No difference that I could see, based on this chroma sampling torture test image. But then I wanted to see if DisplayPort was any better or worse – it was hard to see, but it seemed like I was getting some level of subsampling at every refresh rate, so I plugged the thunderbolt cable back in, and now I don't get subsampling at 144Hz either. So… the entire saga was just a loose thunderbolt connection, maybe?  Or some bad persistent state in the display, cleared by power cycling it when I was experimenting? I still really wish I could get a quick report on the display protocol so I didn't need to take multiple comparison pictures every time I made a change!\nUpdate 2022-06-09: At some point the signal quality degraded again, and the torture-test image started showing subsampling reliably.  So the connection at 144Hz is extremely prone to interference, possibly operating right at the top of the available thunderbolt bandwidth, or... something. Not clear. But I'm down to 120 again for good this time.  I'd still love a clear answer as to how to diagnose this properly without guessing...\nUpdate 2022-07-01: For unrelated reasons I tried to use the DisplayPort connection again, just to see. And now… it's working great, and even offers me variable refresh rates up to 144Hz, taking advantage of FreeSync.  Upon first being plugged in, once again, I saw chroma subsampling.  At every refresh rate.  But then, cycling back and forth between thunderbolt inputs, I now see no subsampling, again, at every refresh rate.  This whole process is crazy-making without any diagnostic tools!  I have had some other issues with the dock, and have RMA'd it and will be replacing it this week, so maybe this has something to do with a defect in the dock where it's stepping down to lower display bandwidths because of a fault rather than because this is how it's supposed to work.  I've already RMA'd it, and when I receive the replacement I'll conduct these tests again.\nUpdate 2023-01-18: I seem to have settled into a pattern with this, where every time I unplug the computer from the dock and then plug it back in, I'm back to YPbPr 422 and I have to open Displays and toggle HDR on, then back off again, and it settles in to RGB and stays there.  Very annoying but at least manageable.\n\nA: Apparently the issue is that YPbPr is being used at all, and the monitor ought to be in RGB mode, and this is a well-known issue that has been much discussed elsewhere.  I have now learned how to activate the service menu on my display, inspect the colorspace (currently, RGB 444, and no artifacts of chroma subsampling).\nSince my display is working properly for the moment due to some random auto-detection going correctly for this particular configuration, if this issue were to recur, I'd use this script from Github to force the display into RGB mode again.\nThe aforementioned script does not actually work.  What does seem to work reliably, at least for now, is to open Displays, switch to 120Hz, toggle HDR on, then toggle it off again, which reliably gets me an RGB mode.  However, every time I unplug from the dock and plug back in, it's back to YUV 422 and I need to manually do this again.  I have yet to figure out a way to automate it,\n(Update 2023-1-25: I found a way to automate it.  But at what cost…)\n… or even to detect if it's necessary.  The com.apple.windowserver.displays.plist preferences described elsewhere does not seem to reliably have a PixelEncoding key that accurately describes the current state of the external display; it's usually right but after having a gadget in my shell prompt that reads it every few minutes, I've noticed that it's just … randomly different sometimes, with no pattern I can detect.  Editing it does not seem to have an effect, either; sometimes it just gets overwritten with a non-0 PixelEncoding.\nI've filed a feedback with Apple and I'd encourage anyone else dealing with this issue do the same, since these janky hacks and workarounds should not be necessary.  It can and should just autodetect the full bandwidth it should use.\n", "Q: Suspend to disk - aka Apple Save Sleep - doesn't work in Big Sur Since installing Big Sur on my MacBook Air 2014, I noticed that suspend to disk doesn't seem to work anymore.

I'm pretty sure this was set to about an hour in earlier versions of MacOS.\n\nA: sudo pmset autopoweroffdelay 3600 did the trick, suspend to disk works again.\nWhat I still don't understand is way this was set to such an absurdly high value in the first place. The only reason I can imagine is that suspend to RAM got very efficient with the new M1 architecture; making suspend to disk obsolete. Forcing this on older Macs though seems very questionable.\n", "Q: What are the downsides of putting GNU coreutills first in ${PATH}? I'm coming from Linux to macOS, and many of my scripts assume GNU versions of the utils provided in GNU coreutils.\nI could just put the GNU coreutils bin directory in earlier in $PATH than /bin.\nIs this commonly done?  If I do it, what downsides/breakages should I expect in future?\n\nA: I think it's safer to not have the GNU coreutils first in PATH, but I don't really know macOS.\nA relatively easy way to get your existing scripts to use GNU coreutils is to\nredefine PATH in the beginning of each script.\nexport PATH=/path/to/coreutils:$PATH\n\nThis way you won't have to rename (or add full path) to all of the commands in a script.\n\nA: It will break any script which expects BSD-style utilities (different arguments, partially different functionality)\nBut you can install coreutils with Homebrew or Macports which will give them a g prefix (gcp etc). And then adapt your scripts to use those (depending on the platform they run).\n\nA: While using un-prefixed coreutils has the potential to break any script expecting BSD-style programs, I have been using un-prefixed coreutils for almost 8 years now, and I've never run into a single issue. Given the anecdotal nature of that experience report you should take it with a grain of salt, but my experience has been that the reported dangers of un-prefixing are overblown.\n", "Q: How to permanently disable the Mac startup sound? I am using a MacBook Air (Mojave, 10.14.6), and I want to permanently disable the awful Startup Sound (\"chime\"). I tried any of the following commands:\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%80\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%01\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=” “\n\nAfter each command, I did a shutdown of the Mac, and started it up again (no reboot).

I managed to connect to my Mac and another Windows computer when I’m connected to the same wifi. Is it possible to setup a connection when I’m using cellular data or I’m connected to another wifi? If so, how? I’ve searched the web far and wide but I nothing came up. Thank you in advance for your help\n\nA: Yes… but…\nIn theory you can connect to any server you have the address for - but in practise getting through to your own home network requires a lot of additional work.\nYou first need to know your home public IP address, which may change on a regular basis at the whim of your ISP, or may be unreachable if it is behind a CGNAT (Carrier-grade Network Address Translation) structure.\nOnce past this hurdle, you then need to set up port-forwarding on your router, to send the correct packets to the designated in-house computer. This comes with its own set of security issues you need to be prepared for, as it essentially opens up a part of your home computer's system to direct access from the internet.\nAll in all, unless you are very invested in achieving this - it's simpler to say \"it's not possible\".\nUse iCloud or DropBox etc. instead.\nStructures such as iCloud & DropBox work by connecting to a central offsite 'cloud' location accessible from anywhere in the world, with the correct credentials. They don't rely on trying to 'punch a hole' in your existing home network's security.\n", "Q: Macbook air M1 right speaker stops working until restarted I am have been a windows user since I remember.

I have this working on another Mac running Catalina where I'm using BootUnlock.  I initially installed it directly from the download but that was the x86 version, so I rebuilt it, cleaned down the remnants of the x86 version and re-installed the dual-architecture version:\nroot@samhain ~ # file /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/*\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock:   Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64e:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e]\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock (for architecture x86_64):     Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock (for architecture arm64e):     Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/diskutil.xsl: ASCII text\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/helper.sh:    Bourne-Again shell script text executable, ASCII text\n/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/update.sh:    Bourne-Again shell script text executable, ASCII text\nroot@samhain ~ #\n\nIt had set the access to the volumes correctly:\n\nHowever when I rebooted it and logged in it was asking for permission to access the Keychain:\n\nAny ideas to get BootUnlock working or suggestions of an alternative tool or method?\nUpdate 1\nI set up a Monterey VM on my Mac Pro (2019, x86) and installed BootUnlock—and it works.  On the face of it this is an M1 problem.  The log (/var/log/BootUnlock.log) on the MacBook Pro M1 has entries like this:\nTrying to unlock volume \"sTimeMachine\" with UUID ED793E20-4F9D-4A8E-9185-B2735A1164B0 ...\nNOTICE: could not find the secret on the System keychain, skipping the volume.\n\nUpdate 2\nIt's very simple really, the binary is being killed:\nroot@samhain ~ # /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock\nzsh: killed     /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock\nroot@samhain ~ # \n\nThis happens when you attempt to run the wrong architecture but as shown above BootUnlock has both architectures.\n\nA: Apple Silicon Macs require that all executables are signed. When you run an unsigned executable, it is not allowed to run - and it will show up in the shell as \"killed\".\nAs you compiled the tool yourself, you have probably left out codesigning. You can do that after compiling by running this command in the Terminal:\ncodesign -s - /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/au.com.openwall.BootUnlock/BootUnlock\n\nThe \"-\" means that it will perform an ad-hoc signing. The resulting signature does not use a specific identity and the program will only be able to run on your own local machine. If you have either a developer subscription with Apple, or you have created a free certificate with your Apple ID, you can use that for signing instead.\nUPDATE:\nI have found the source repository for the program in question, and can see that the BootUnlock is not a new, unique binary - but rather just a copy of the built-in /usr/bin/security program. As that program is known to work and is codesigned appropriately, it would be a good idea to change the script to simply call /usr/bin/security instead of BootUnlock.\n\nA: This is not an answer per se, it's just a rather ugly workaround.  If I get a fix I will post it.  With the help and insight of @jksoegaard I figured out the best workaround for the BootUnlock problem.\n\n*\n\n*Download BootUnlock from its site\n\n*Install the package as normal\n\n*There's a bug in the install that if you select the wrong volume you\ncan't cancel it (I must try fixing that bug), so make sure you\nselect the correct ones.

For example for your disk4:\nlsof /dev/disk4\n\nor if you have multiple volumes on that disk mounted:\nlsof /dev/disk4*\n\nor you can use a mount point like this:\nlsof /Volumes/MyDisk\n\nYou'll get a list of open files along with the PID of the process that holds the file open.

There's nothing there I care about but it's a workspace.\nWhen I booted to the Catalina partition it found the original partition and mounted it as read-only.\nI am not able to manually access any of my user files there because of permissions.  I imagine I could work around that but I'm hoping I won't have to.\nI understand the original boot partition is effectively hosed as a boot partition.  My intention is to purchase a 1TB SSD to backup to, then reformat the entire HDD and restore the errant partition (as much as it will since obviously there's something wrong with it).\nMy question, as Professor Barbary would say \"in 27 parts\", is - what is the best way to go about this?  Should I:\n\n*\n\n*Tell Catalina I want to make a Time Machine backup of the HFS+ partition to the SDD?\n\n*Use DiskUtil to make a disk image of the partition?\n\n*Or use a third party tool to copy the files and file structure to the SDD, and if so, what would you suggest?  (There's so many out there, I have no confidence sorting the wheat from the chafe.)\n\nAdditionally, should I format the SSD in HFS+ or APFS since the original partition is HFS+?  Would Catalina allow me to format the SDD as HFS?\nIt's been suggested, and I probably will, eventually turn the SSD into a Catalina boot drive and move everything over to make it the primary, but for now I just want to make sure my files are safe.\n(Ooo, that suggests another option - making the SDD a boot drive and using Migration Assistant to move everything over from the errant partition?  ...since I can't manually mount the drive and there are unknown issues I worry whether Migration Assistant would see the partition, though.)\nThanks to David Anderson for his various inputs that have gotten me this far.\n\nA: After reviewing a few suggestions, and after some other minor issues (the workspace Catalina partition I had created stopped booting, so I removed it and replaced it with a High Sierra installation), I opted for the following:\n\n*\n\n*Formatted the SSD to HFS+ (since I was using High Sierra)\n\n*Downloaded Carbon Copy Cloner through the workspace partition.  (Disk Drill, mentioned above, cost more than the drive, while CCC offers a 30 day trial.)\n\n*Cloned the original partition to the SSD (took about 4 hours, no errors found).\n\n*True to advertising, I WAS ABLE TO BOOT THE SSD.\n\nI haven't browsed every file; I imagine there may be a few lost, but this is still leaps and bounds over reformatting and losing it all.  CCC apparently turned the SSD into APFS format, so I went ahead and updated to Catalina by downloading the installer.\nAs an aside, I did try originally using DiskUtility's \"Restore\" function to copy the partition, but this failed with errors.\nAs noted above, the partition had become unreadable due to a software issue.  I had manually rebuilt the partition map so felt confident I wasn't going to affect file tables by working in the space outside of the target partition.  If this had been a mechanical issue, I would have been far more concerned about using the drive as a workbench which, while not impossible, would have made things more difficult.\n", "Q: Get group chat membership from `chat.db` I'm able to able to natively access my iMessages through chat.db. and associated contacts through the databases in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources - is there any similar database for storing group chat membership/metadata?\nAFAIK this information is not stored in AddressBook or chat.db, although it is possible to access the group chat name through the chat table in chat.db\n\nA: I couldn't find a full answer, but I did find a good workaround!\nThe handle table which is joined by chat_handle_join allows you to get the users associated with a message sent in a group chat.

Nothing about your setup seems to involve VPN - just run of the mill networking behind NAT gateways.\nYou can confirm this from the command line with scutil\nbmike@m1 /Users % scutil\n> show State:/Network/Global/IPv4\n<dictionary> {\n  PrimaryInterface : en0\n  PrimaryService : 73EEA9EF-DA84-4A1E-9E0A-0B24FF6C0091\n  Router : 192.168.0.1\n}\n> show State:/Network/Interface/en0/IPv4\n<dictionary> {\n  Addresses : <array> {\n    0 : 192.168.0.103\n  }\n  BroadcastAddresses : <array> {\n    0 : 192.168.0.255\n  }\n  SubnetMasks : <array> {\n    0 : 255.255.255.0\n  }\n}\n> exit\nbmike@m1 /Users % curl ip.me\n160.130.4.141\n\nThe Mac can only control when it requests / changes an address to any interface. It's up to the network router to get a public IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address.\nIn my case, my router is the device that is using 160.130.4.141 (if I were actually using the space previously assigned to SONY corporation and now is assigned to the Florida Department of Management Services). You should check your router or ISP to determine why it (they) are cycling your address.\n", "Q: How iOS apps keep track of me across reinstallations? I installed app MyApp on iOS 15, I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it, the app still recognized my phone. How did it do that?\n\n*\n\n*iCloud backup is not enabled for this app.\n\n*App data was lost after reinstallation, but it did recognize my phone.\n\n*I did not allow apps to 'Ask to Track'.\n\n*The app limits what you can do with the same phone probably to prevent abuse.\n\nWas the app fingerprinting my phone, or did it have access to some device specific identifers?\n\nA: I would say none of the above.\nUsually the situation you describe is due to the app saving information into the Keychain on the phone. When you uninstall the app, the Keychain data is not deleted. Therefore when the app is reinstalled, it can load in the data stored earlier.\nI assume the app in question really isn't called \"MyApp\", so that makes it hard to say whether this is actually the case for you. There are other ways something similar can happen, but the above way is by far the most common. If your situation is actually so that you have taken advantage of a \"once-only free trial\" and want to get another \"free trial\" by covering your tracks, it can also be because of fuse bits stored at Apple.\n", "Q: Cannot block site z1.fm from etc hosts When I try to block some websites on terminal by editing a bad address int /etc/hosts file it works in safari.\nBut when I try to do it with z1.fm, it doesn't.

I am using MacBook Air M1 MacOS Big Sur 11.6, Safari Version 15.0 (16612.1.29.41.4, 16612).\n\nA: The proper way to block content in safari is with an extension that blocks content, not DNS. I use stopthemadness extension on macOS and OneBlocker on iOS / iPadOS but can’t recommend a macOS specific tool, just mention some that do different things.\n\n*\n\n*https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/\n\n*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-ad-blocker-privacy/id1365531024\nIf you don’t want to find an extension or can’t use that, try with safari to isolate it from search engine influence. Go to settings and turn off everything that might preload search results like suggestions, preloading and quick search.\n\nShow favorites is probably safe to leave on. This is a common thing people run into when they try their hand at using the hosts file to manipulate DNS results. In your case, since z1.fm, z2.fm and www.z1.fm are not at all the same to a program. You will have to block all entry point names even though currently there may be a web redirect or both might resolve via DNS to the same IPv4 addresses in the end once a browser takes over.\nbmike@m1 /Users % nslookup z1.fm\nServer:     192.168.0.1\nAddress:    192.168.0.1#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   z1.fm\nAddress: 172.67.69.59\nName:   z1.fm\nAddress: 104.26.3.54\nName:   z1.fm\nAddress: 104.26.2.54\n\nBased on your search engine, it may also change what you type thinking you made a typo and thwart your efforts to not browse that content.\n", "Q: Bootcamp- your device ran into a problem and needs to restart Have had many successful USB Windows 10 installs before.

Instead Apple has opted for booting the Windows installation software from the same drive as Windows is to be installed on. After Windows is installed, the installation software is converted to free space and then this freee space is added to the preceding partition.\nBorrowing from this answer, below is the instructions for creating a bootable Windows 10 installer. This was tested on a older version of macOS and older release of Windows 10.\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Windows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft website Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File).\n\nNote: This answer was tested using 1909 (September 2019) update.\n\n\n\n*Download Window Support Software. Open the Boot Camp Assistant application. From the menu bar, select Action->Download Windows Support Software. By Default, the files should download to WindowsSupport folder in your home folder. When the popup shown below appears, enter your password then click on the Unlock button.\n\nWhen finished, quit the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n\n*Plug in the external drive. Open the Disk Utility application. In the pulldown menu in the upper left corner of the Disk Utility application, make sure Hide Sidebar is not checked off and Show All Devices is check off, as shown below.\n\nHighlight the external drive and select the Erase button. Enter the following in the popup window, then click on the Erase button.\n\nWhen finished erasing, click on the Done button. With the external drive still highlighted, click on the Partition button. Make the following changes in the order given below.\n\nNote: The size entered below has to be large enough to create a volume that can hold the Windows ISO and Window Support Software files. The value of 16 GB should provide more that enough space. However, a smaller value can be substituted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the + button.\n\n\n*Enter a size of 16 GB.\n\n\n*Enter the name WINSTALL.\n\n\n*Select the ExFAT format.\n \nThe result should appear as shown below.\n\nClick on the Apply, Partition, and Done buttons in the given order. When finished, quit the Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Using the Finder application, mount the Window 10 ISO file and copy the contents to the WINSTALL volume. Next copy the contents of the WindowsSupport folder to the WINSTALL volume. In your case, the result should appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Open a Terminal Application window and enter the following commands. These commands create labels that will eventually appear below the Mac Startup Manager external drive icons.\nbless --folder /Volumes/WINSTALL/efi/boot --label \"Install Windows\"\nmkdir /Volumes/WINSTALL/label\nbless --folder /Volumes/WINSTALL/label --label \"Windows\"\n\nWhen finished, quit the Terminal application.\n\n\n*Restart the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Boot from the external drive by selecting the external drive icon labeled Install Windows.\n\n\n*The first window to appear should be similar to the one shown below.\n\n\nThe rest of this step is only important if you need to open a Command Prompt window.\n\nProceed as one would for a GUI installation of Windows. When a window similar to the one shown below appears, press the shift+F10 key combination.\n\nNote: If you press the shift+F10 key combination before the image below appears, then the Windows installer may not have loaded drivers from the Windows Support Software.\n\n\n\nThe result should be the appearance of the Command Prompt window shown below.\n\n\n", "Q: How to reclaim free space for APFS after freeing it on Bootcamp? I have a fairly old macbook (2016) with a 256Gb hard drive running Catalina 10.15.7 on which I've set up Bootcamp splitting the disk roughly in half at the time.\nRecently, I've decided to upgrade to BigSur and found out that I'm out of disk space to do so, the update says that about 25Gb is needed and since I had enough space on Bootcamp for my needs I've partitioned its size to be less, sure enough running into jinxing my APFS partition which is happily answered here on this helpful website :)\nThat freed up about 35Gb space on the disk, enough for my update, but I now cannot find a way to merge it with the original MacOS container:\n\nI would like to keep both Bootcamp and the existing MacOS intact, just add the free space to the existing 'Macintosh HD' as on the picture above and then proceed with my system upgrade. After browsing some further helpful answers here and here I now realize that this might just be harder than it looks because I don't have free space to clone any of the 2 partitions I want to keep if I go that way, and the sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s3 0 does not work for me since the Free Space precedes the MacOS container (there is also a FAT32 container likely related to Bootcamp right at the beginning of the disk) and returns the following error:\nError: -69519: The target disk is too small for this operation, or a gap is required in your partition map which is missing or too small, which is often caused by an attempt to grow a partition beyond the beginning of another partition or beyond the end of partition map usable space\n\nFree Space is disk0s2 then followed by the MacOS space disk0s3 and finally the Bootcamp space disk0s4 and all together it looks like one big ugly this:\n\n\nSo is it even possible? Will I have to use an external hard drive to clone any of the 2 existing systems out, format, and then clone them back in?

I use the DNS ad blocker AdGuard on my iPad which is nice but, some apps don’t work as intended when being blocked. I’d like to white list one of the games I play (Crossy Road.) How would I go about doing that?\n\nA: I assume this is about the DNS filter within AdGuard. The manual page doesn’t mention whitelisting of apps. Not sure this even is possible, the DNS probably doesn‘t even know which app is trying to resolve a name. So disabling it while playing Crossy Road might be the best option here.\n", "Q: Mounting a Samba share from the command line doesn't work unless you're root on the Mac. No problem if mounting a true Windows share If I use Finder's ⌘K shortcut, I can mount SMB shares as my normal MacOS user. A mount point is created in /Volumes, and the mount point will be owned by the user I'm logged in as.\nBut there are limitations to this approach. One limitation is that Finder will only let you use one account on the remote system. In other words, If I have access to two home directories under different accounts on the same SMB server, I can't mount them both with Finder.\nBut I can mount them both from the command line. The command is:\nmount -t smbfs //user@host/target mount-point\n\nYou should be able to just run this command as your normal user and the resulting mount would be owned by that user. Someone claims success doing this here.\nSomeone else had the same problem as me, but with a different error, here. The solutions provided then don't work now.\nAnd all of this works fine when mounting a share being served by Windows.\nBut if I want to mount a share being served by Samba, I have to either be logged in as root (in which case the mount will succeed but the filesystem will be owned by root), or I have to use Finder.\nIf I run mount as my normal user, the error I depends on if the mount point exists or not.\nIf it does:\nmacbook:~ user$ mount -t smbfs //user@linuxhost/remote-path local-path\nPassword for host: \nmount_smbfs: mount error: /Users/user/local-path: File exists\nmount: /Users/user/local-path failed with 64\n\nIf it doesn't:\nmacbook:~ user$ rmdir local-path\nmacbook:~ user$ mount -t smbfs //user@linuxhost/remote-path local-path\nmount: realpath /Users/user/local-path: No such file or directory\n\nThe File exists error is not caused by the SMB share already being mounted.\nWhat difference between Samba and Windows might mount_smbfs be picking up on that triggers this problem?\n\nA: The mount-point needs to be a directory on the local machine.  Depending on what you are doing I like to use a folder in the local user directory.\ncd ~/Desktop\nmkdir user1mp\nmkdir user2mp\nmount -t smbfs -o nobrowse smb://user1:pass1@host/user1 user1mp\nmount -t smbfs -o nobrowse smb://user2:pass2@host/user2 user2mp\n\n\nA: On my system - macOS Catalina this works:\nMount an smbfs/cifs drive manually:\n1. Preferred: use mount -t filesystem spec\n% mount -t smbfs //username:userpasswd@ServerName/ShareName /Users/username/mount-point \n\n# For example:  \n% mount -t smbfs //seamus:mysecret@SynologyNAS-1/backups /Users/seamus/rsync_dest \n\n2. Also seems to work using mount_smbfs directly:\n% mount_smbfs //seamus:mysecret@SynologyNAS-1/backups /Users/seamus/rsync_dest/ \n\n3. Troubleshooting\nIf these don't work, there are some alternatives worth looking into:\n\n*\n\n*Instead of using the hostname (e.g. SynologyNAS-1), use the host's IP address instead.\n\n\n*The SMB protocol has a checkered past. You may have different versions on your client, and your server, and they will negotiate to select the \"best\" one. However, SMB ver 1 was so bad - so insecure - that it is generally blacklisted in modern implementations; i.e. a client may refuse to connect to a server that's limited to SMB ver 1, and vice-versa. In my experience, Apple's mount_smbfs does not seem to blacklist SMB ver 1 servers, but macOS is rather opaque, and there may be other things afoot; i.e. it's worth a look. The mount command has a -v (verbose) option that may give some useful clues.\nSome points in the documentation:\n\n*\n\n*Refer to man mount_smbfs for a list of the options\n\nman mount_smbfs says:\n\nAt run time, mount_smbfs reads the ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf file for additional configuration parameters and a password.\n\nThere is also a man nsmb.conf which says:\n\n/etc/nsmb.conf  The global configuration file.\n~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf\nThe user's configuration file, conflicts will be overwritten by the global file\n\nHOWEVER: neither /etc/nsmb.conf, nor ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf exist on my system. Nevertheless, both the above commands cause my system to mount the drive. \"The drive\" is a Synology NAS, and the share is SMB.\n\nA: There appear to be 2 paths, neither ideally what you desire. Information heavily borrowed from this post:\n\n*\n\n*Use the command\n$ open 'smb://user@hostname/shared_drive/directory'\n\nThis will use Finder to do the same thing as using the Finder menu Go->Connect to Server. This will preserve correct permissions and ownership of the share nodes.\n\n\n*Create a mount directory, set ownership to yourself, mount the share:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /Volumes/Local_mount_folder\n$ sudo chown your_local_user /Volumes/Local_mount_folder\n$ mount -t smbfs //WORKGROUP\\;user@hostname/shared_drive/directory /Volumes/Local_mount_folder\n\nNote that the last line does NOT contain 'sudo'. It is not required for the mount command in Mac OS 12.1 if you own the mount point. You will be prompted for your WORKGROUP\\user domain password. WORKGROUP will be required if connecting to a domain.\nAlso note that the this option will cause all nodes (files & directories) in the root (and possibly more) of the mounted share to be listed as being owned by you. That does not play well in the SMB ecosystem, IMO.\nIf you get an error message that 'File exists', you most likely have a mount directory by that name, owned by root, and only visible to root. You must 'sudo ls -alF /Volumes' to see it. Once confirmed you can 'sudo rmdir <folder_path>' to stop the error message.\nTo unmount and delete the mount point, simply:\n    $ sudo umount /Volumes/Local_mount_folder\n\nYou will get an error message if you do this with any files/directories open in that share, including Terminal windows.\nThus I continue to search for a refinement on option 2 above.\n", "Q: Where is kernel_task? I see kernel_task in Activity monitor. But I cannot find where the binary file is using Spotlight. Does anybody know where the binary is found on the disk? I am using Big Sur 11.4. But my question may not be related to the particular version of the OS.\n\nA: The process name kernel_task is artificially set by the xnu kernel itself during initialization (see bsd_init()) as a way to represent the kernel's threads to users and other processes within the BSD layer as part of its process accounting system. The kernel binary lives in /System/Library/Kernels/kernel. However, recent releases of macOS do not load this image directly. For both speed and security reasons, that binary gets prelinked along with all of its active kernel extensions (KEXTs) and the prelinked image is stored in /System/Library/PrelinkedKernels on Intel Macs or the Preboot volume on Apple Silicon Macs. That is the actual image that is loaded upon boot firmware control handoff.\n", "Q: Apple APP store will not accept my current password I recently decided to revive an old phone to use around the house on wifi when my current phone is charging. I set the phone up fine with my Apple ID and password, but when I went to go to the App store, it prompted me for my Apple ID and password. I entered it over 7 times, making sure each time that it was indeed correct, however I am still being refused  access.\nThe only solution I am  offered in this circumstance is to reset the password, but I haven't actually forgotten my password, its just this one device that wont allow me to use it for the App store.\nWhy does my password work just fine to log into Apple services elsewhere, but not on the App Store on this old phone I would really appreciate it.\nrunning IOS 8.1.1. on an Apple Iphone 4!\nEDIT- As a workaround, I wiped the phone to try and start over. Again though, it still will not accept my password for the App store.\n\nA: I was finally able to log into the Itunes store with my password, but there was an extra step that was not explained. I had to speak with a friend who told me that when a code comes up on another device that users need to add this code AFTER their passcode in the same field. For example:\nif my password was WaterBedLou\nand the code that was sent to my other device was: 292 399\nI would need to enter: WaterBedLou292399\nI am glad this worked, but wished there was some explanation of this during the process of trying to log in. Hopefully this answer helps anyone else with the same issue.\n", "Q: How do I prevent a crash when interacting with Blu-Ray videos? I have a new M1 Pro Mac and I installed ffmpeg using brew. I also have a Blu-Ray ISO (contains .m2ts files) on standby to be converted to .mkv.\nPreviously on a Intel mac, I used this command and it worked fine, shrinking the size of the original file by a lot:\nffmpeg -i file.m2ts -c:v copy -crf 28 -c:a flac ~/desktop/mynew.mkv\n\nWhen I do this on my M1; where I expect the 'encoding' to be faster, I get an astounding KERNEL PANIC!\nI'm pretty sure ffmpeg isn't corrupted. I used homebrew to install it on macOS 12.0.1 (21A559). The same command with a mp4 in place (test.m2ts -> test.mp4) does not crash. Performing cp on said .m2ts file (cp test.m2ts ~/desktop/a.m2ts) causes a panic. I have discovered that the problem is how each computer handles the .m2ts file. Same file on Intel and M1, except it causes a crash on M1.\nSo, what can I do in this situation? Do I wait for another Monterey update to fix this? I've also read that playing an HDR video causes a panic, however playing a Blu-Ray disc in VLC causes no crash.\nFor those interested in the Panic Log, here is a pastebin link of a crash caused by FFMPEG: https://pastebin.com/f1gemPQ2\nand here is a crash with symbolication enabled, but caused by me OPENING the folder with m2ts: https://paste.ee/p/n65io\n\nA: \n\"panicString\" : \"panic(cpu 3 caller 0xfffffe002580c9e4):\nvm_object_iopl_request: missing/bad page in kernel object\n@vm_pageout.c:9356\n\nFrom your initial panic report, it seems that you are hitting a synchronous panic during a request to the virtual memory subsystem to create a new I/O universal page list. This, alone, doesn't tell us enough. We need to gather further information to get nearer to the root cause.\nZooming out for a moment: You are clearly encountering a bug in macOS because – by definition and design! – it must be impossible for an unprivileged user to induce a kernel panic, especially one with 100% reproducibility like this. This bug is ultimately Apple's fault. Without additional debugging (which requires custom tools and access to Apple's proprietary source code), you are unlikely to determine root cause and are guaranteed to not be able to effect a true fix to the underlying issue (which would require making a change to xnu and/or other codebases). This is not surprising, as both Monterey and the M1 Pro are new and there are often bugs at release time.\nThis means that, for now, your best bet is to\n\n*\n\n*Gather as much information as you can,\n\n*Report the bug to Apple with all of the information from #1, and\n\n*Try to find a short-term workaround while Apple investigates and fixes this bug.\n\nThe first step in gathering more information is to make your panic report more useful. This means two things:\n\n*\n\n*Don't omit the list of loaded KEXTs (or any other information) from your report; every line in a panic report was intentionally put in because it can contain an important and subtle clue about the root cause.\n\n*We need to collect a new panic report with kernel symbolication enabled so that the backtrace can tell us what call chain led to the VM panic.\n\nTo enable symbolication:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a general error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine. The next time this panic occurs, your report will have a symbolicated backtrace. Please amend your question with a new link to it.\n\nA: Also having this same issue with both my M1 Mac mini and my 14\" M1 MacBook Pro (I was hoping it was an issue isolated to the M1 Mac mini (which I'd been experiencing since purchase in November 2020.\nAll I want to be able to do is extract the .m2ts file so that I can convert it to an MKV but as soon as I touch that file or try to copy the entire BDMV folder the whole machine will crash and reboot.\nDoes anyone know of any other ways of mounting the image file in MacOS other than the built in software?\n", "Q: Any way to create custom terminal keywords?

The executed code remains the same and the instruction & data latency and bandwidth are also the same.\nThere are two cases I can think of when it may make a difference:\n\n*\n\n*If /Applications and ~/Applications reside on two different volumes – and, particularly, if those volumes are on different physical disks, especially disks that have different performance characteristics. (E.g., if you leave /Applications on an internal SSD but move ~/Applications onto an external hard disk attached via USB 2.0, there can definitely be a noticeable slowdown at both launch and runtime for the latter.) You would have had to have intentionally set it up this way, so you'd know if this was the case.\n\n*If a particular application intentionally changes its behavior depending on its location.

I have many HomePod mini (at least one in every room/corridor). And after I went upstair to my bedroom I noticed the downstair HomePod mini (assuming in the living room) got triggered by it’s timer or countdown.\nThere seem to be no option anywhere in Home App.\nEven for cases where you might be a long distance from the device, it’s worse of a second HomePod in my bedroom or corridor just responds with There’s nothing to stop or with there’s nothing to mute or there’s nothing playing due to it being closer to me than the one currently alerting.\nOn occasion this can be highly inconvenient (say music or a movie was loud but now quiet) causing the downstairs unit to blast a timer alarm at full volume past midnight. Other scenarios could be, that I’m away from home and receive a call from my neighbour saying my Siri alarm is triggering him/her.\nI did fount this Same Question on Discord, but no working answers there… :(\nIs there a way to stop the HomePod timer alarm remotely?\n\nA: Yes, it is now possible with Home app on iOS 15.5.

Sometime recently the behaviour of the feature on my machine (Mac mini 2018, Big Sur 11.3.1) has changed such that it now only displays a small thumbnail of the images, like this:\n\nThis only seems to effect files I haven't opened - once a file has been opened (eg. in Preview) Quick Look correctly shows a full screen version of the file.\nI've tried restarting and clearing the thumbnail cache (qlmanage -r cache) but to no effect. I've also tried forcing Quick Look to preview a dir of images (ie. qlmanage -p ./*) which works but is very slow when switching images. Once images have been previewed in this way, Quick Look again functions as usual.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: This just happened to me (Monterey 12.4, 16\" M1 2021 MBP) and I too, tried resetting the Quick Look mechanism (qlmanage -r, qlmanage -r cache) to no avail.\nQuitting and restarting Finder fixed it, though\nkillall Finder\n\n\nA: Gaah.. I wrote up this whole question before figuring it out. Hopefully this helps some other unlucky users.\nThe problem was Dropbox \"Smart Sync\". The images causing problems were recently \"sync'ed\" to my machine from Dropbox. Unfortunately, the way Dropbox works these days is to create, sort of, place holder files that are downloaded behind the scenes when first accessed. This explains why Quick Look was unable to show a full screen preview of the images unless they'd been opened first, as opening the files causes them to be (actually) downloaded.\nThe solution is to right click on the offending files and the Smart Sync > Local option. Although I have all the \"Smart Sync\" options turned off in my Dropbox prefs, files selectively synced to a machine still enter this state. Apparently the only way to completely disable it is to disable the filesystem integration, but I suspect that would have other consequences.\n", "Q: Factory reset from terminal I am wondering if there is a way to trigger a factory reset with terminal.\nMy osx install is damaged after some disk operations and now I can't charge the laptop.

I would like to turn off kernel_task.\nWhere is kernel_task?\nAs discussed here, it is prelinked with KEXTs. So by changing KEXTs, it can be turned off?\nCould anybody show me how to turn off kernel_task on Big Sur?\n\nA: It is not possible to turn off kernel_task - except by turning off your computer.\nkernel_task is not a normal process (running program), but rather a representation of some of the functionality that is implemented by the operating system kernel. Amongst functionality implemented by the kernel is for example: accessing disk drives (also SSDs), communicating on networks (Ethernet, WiFi, etc.), talking to peripherals (such as making keyboards, trackpads work and getting things to show up on the display). If you could disable kernel_task, it would cause all programs that require the operating system (that is effectively all programs on your computer) to stop working.\n", "Q: App Keyboard Shortcut for Context Menus? In Mac Pages there is a context menu item I use all the time: Look Up \"[highlighted word]\"\nI would like to assign a keyboard shortcut to this menu item.

Thanks.\n\nA: It is correct that macOS kernel when sensing too high temperatures will try to lower temperature by effectively idling the CPU. This shows up in Activity Monitor as the kernel_task process using a lot of CPU time - which is actually not really the case, but that CPU time is not available to other processes either.\nI would not attempt to disable this mechanism in macOS when faced with this issue. Instead you should treat the root cause - i.e. why is the system sensing too high temperatures.\nThis could be due to the system actually being too hot (clean fans, replace thermal paste, etc.) or it could be sensor error (recalibrate sensor, replace sensor).\nIf you absolutely need to disable the mechanism, look at a guide such as this. It basically instructs you to disable the IOPlatformPluginFamily kernel extension - which is nearly always a very bad idea.\nAlso you should always remember to recheck your assumptions. Could it be that kernel_task is not seemingly using lots of CPU time because of the machine being hot, but rather that you have a very special workload or hit a bug that caused kernel_task to actually consume lots of CPU time. It would be a good idea to ensure that this is not the case, if you haven't done so already.\nDepending on the version of macOS you're running, you can gather more information by running these commands in the Terminal:\nioreg -l | grep ForcedIdle\nioreg -l | grep IdlePLimit\n\nLook for \"IdlePLimitRegistered\".\n\nA: To build on @jksoegaard's excellent answer:\nIn order to rule out the possibility of this being caused by a viral workload or a bug in the kernel or a kernel extension, we need to see what the kernel is doing when it's consuming excess CPU. The way to do this is by collecting and analyzing a spindump. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a general error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet:\n sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n\n*Perform the minimum actions that are necessary in order to put the system into its high-CPU usage state.\n\n\n*As soon as you begin to feel the slowness, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. We can take a look at it and come up with next steps for the investigation.\n", "Q: How to connect old Mac mini to new Mac mini as a external drive I while back I bought a 2018 Mac mini. I'd like to connect my old (2011) Mac mini as an external drive to selectively transfer photos and such.\nI have found some documentation on how to do this, but it never seems to work for me. I think the main issue Im have having is finding the correct cable use.\nMaybe there is a better way? I would use Ethernet but my router is too far away my work area and connecting directly between the two with an Ethernet cable didn't work (I could be doing something wrong). BT would seem to be too slow for moving data between the two. Loading the old data to iCloud would not be good a option as I have very limited data (I'm in the country so I'm limited)\nIf there is a better connection approach, I'm good to hear about it. Otherwise, what cable can I use to connect the two?\nThanks!\n\nA: Using Thunderbolt\nThere is the \"Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter\" which can connect the two Macs at a transfer rate of 10 Gbps. This does require either a \"0.5 m Apple Thunderbolt Cable\" or a \"2.0 m Apple Thunderbolt Cable\" to connect between the adaptor and the 2011 Mac mini.\nSince I do not have \"Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter\", I can only provide an example involving a 2011 iMac (macOS High Sierra 10.13.6) and a 2013 iMac (macOS Catalina 10.15.7), both of which are connected by a \"0.5 m Apple Thunderbolt Cable\". The following steps can be use to setup the 2011 iMac as the server.\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two Macs by a Thunderbolt cable.\n\n\n*Set up File Sharing on the Sharing pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences, as shown below. If desired, you can edit the  list of Shared Folders, but usually this is not necessary. Screen Sharing is also enabled, but this is not required.\n\n\n\n*To get the IP address assigned to the 2011 iMac, highlight Thunderbolt Bridge on the Network pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences as shown below.\n\nThe IP Address 192.168.8.1, shown in the above image, is assigned to the Thunderbolt Bridge connection on the 2011 iMac. The image also shows a Wi-Fi connection, which is not required.\n\n\n*Connect to the server (2011 iMac). From the Finder's menu bar on the 2013 iMac, select Go→Connect to Server…. You can enter the follow.\n\n*\n\n*To access files and volumes on the 2011 iMac, enter the following in the popup window, then select the Connect button.\n\nThe resulting list to choose from should include your home folder, as well as other folders and volumes on the 2011 iMac.\n\n\n*To share the screen on the 2011 iMac, enter the following in the popup window, then select the Connect button.\n\nUsing Ethernet with Internet Sharing\nYou should be able to connect the two Macs by using a ethernet cable at a transfer rate of 1 Gbps. Below is an example involving a 2011 iMac (macOS High Sierra 10.13.6) and a 2013 iMac (macOS Catalina 10.15.7), both of which are connected to the same LAN by WiFi. The following steps can be use to setup the 2011 iMac as the server.\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two Macs by an ordinary ethernet cable.\n\n\n*Turned on Internet Sharing on one of the two Macs. The Mac chosen will not sleep while Internet Sharing is turned on. In this example,  Internet Sharing is setup on the Sharing pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Set up File Sharing on the Sharing pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences, as shown below. If desired, you can edit the  list of Shared Folders, but usually this is not necessary. Screen Sharing is also enabled, but this is not required.\n\n\n\n*To get the IP addresses assigned to the ethernet, highlight Ethernet on the Network pane of the 2013 iMac's System Preferences as shown below.\n\nThe IP Address 192.168.2.3, shown in the above image, is assigned to the ethernet connection on the 2013 iMac. The Router IP address 192.168.2.1, shown in the above image, is assigned to the ethernet connection on the 2011 iMac.\n\n\n*Connect to the server (2011 iMac).

Below is an example involving a 2011 iMac (macOS High Sierra 10.13.6) and a 2013 iMac (macOS Catalina 10.15.7), both of which are optionally connected to the same LAN by WiFi. The transfer rate over the ethernet cable between the two iMacs would be 1 Gbps. The transfer rate between your Mac mini computers would also be 1 Gbps. The following steps can be use to setup the 2011 iMac as the server.\n\n*\n\n*Manually choose an IP address for each iMac. Once possibility would be to choose 192.168.x.1 and 192.160.x.2 where x is between 0 and 254, inclusively. You should choose a value for x so that no other IP address that starts with 192.168.x. is already assigned to either Mac or any other devices that either Mac needs to reach.\nBelow is the Network pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences. This image shows the only connection in use is Wi-Fi. Since the Wi-Fi has the IP address of 192.168.0.114, x can not have the value of 0.\n\nBelow is the Network pane of the 2013 iMac's System Preferences. This image shows the only connection in use is Wi-Fi and also confirms x can not have the value of 0.\n\nBased on the two previous images, x was arbitrarily chosen to be 12.\n\n\n*Connect the two Macs by an ordinary ethernet cable.\n\n\n*Set up File Sharing on the Sharing pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences, as shown below. If desired, you can edit the  list of Shared Folders, but usually this is not necessary. Screen Sharing is also enabled, but this is not required.\n\n\n\n*Configure Ethernet on the Network pane of the 2011 iMac's System Preferences, as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Configure Ethernet on the Network pane of the 2013 iMac's System Preferences, as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Connect to the server (2011 iMac).

It seems the issue is from the frequent disconnecting without ejecting but I'm not sure what else to try.\nHere is what terminal spit out when I put in that code.\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\nBrians-MacBook:~ brianvondedenroth$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType\n2021-12-08 10:57:57.924 system_profiler[15708:1013170] SPUSBDevice: IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService failed 0xe00002be\n2021-12-08 10:57:57.925 system_profiler[15708:1013170] SPUSBDevice: IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService failed 0xe00002be\nUSB:\n\n    USB 3.0 Bus:\n\n      Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBXHCILPTH\n      PCI Device ID: 0x8c31 \n      PCI Revision ID: 0x0005 \n      PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086 \n\n        Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad:\n\n          Product ID: 0x0274\n          Vendor ID: 0x05ac (Apple Inc.)\n          Version: 6.24\n          Serial Number: D3H60310GC1GHMFAD5PS\n          Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n          Location ID: 0x14400000\n\n        Bluetooth USB Host Controller:\n\n          Product ID: 0x8290\n          Vendor ID: 0x05ac (Apple Inc.)\n          Version: 1.69\n          Manufacturer: Broadcom Corp.\n          Location ID: 0x14300000\n\n        My Passport 071A:\n\n          Product ID: 0x071a\n          Vendor ID: 0x1058  (Western Digital Technologies, Inc.)\n          Version: 20.11\n          Serial Number: 575844314135305032363931\n          Speed: Up to 480 Mb/s\n          Manufacturer: Western Digital\n          Location ID: 0x14200000 / 11\n          Current Available (mA): 500\n          Current Required (mA): 500\n          Extra Operating Current (mA): 0\n          Media:\n            My Passport 071A:\n              Capacity: 1 TB (1,000,175,828,992 bytes)\n              Removable Media: No\n              BSD Name: disk2\n              Logical Unit: 0\n              Partition Map Type: GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n              S.M.A.R.T. status: Verified\n              USB Interface: 0\n              Volumes:\n                EFI:\n                  Capacity: 209.7 MB (209,715,200 bytes)\n                  File System: MS-DOS FAT32\n                  BSD Name: disk2s1\n                  Content: EFI\n                  Volume UUID: 7B11024B-2E01-3DDB-B085-1CCFAA24F4B5\n                Brians Pictures:\n                  Capacity: 999.83 GB (999,831,855,104 bytes)\n                  File System: Journaled HFS+\n                  BSD Name: disk2s2\n                  Content: Apple_HFS\n                  Volume UUID: EE82A5C7-92E9-37F4-9F05-0CFB0765AAA9\n\nLatest System Profiler Result:\n2021-12-10 08:32:43.863 system_profiler[20593:1810791] SPUSBDevice: IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService failed 0xe00002be\n2021-12-10 08:32:43.865 system_profiler[20593:1810791] SPUSBDevice: IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService failed 0xe00002be\nUSB:\nUSB 3.0 Bus:\n\n  Host Controller Driver: AppleUSBXHCILPTH\n  PCI Device ID: 0x8c31 \n  PCI Revision ID: 0x0005 \n  PCI Vendor ID: 0x8086 \n\n    Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad:\n\n      Product ID: 0x0274\n      Vendor ID: 0x05ac (Apple Inc.)\n      Version: 6.24\n      Serial Number: D3H60310GC1GHMFAD5PS\n      Manufacturer: Apple Inc.\n      Location ID: 0x14400000\n\n    Bluetooth USB Host Controller:\n\n      Product ID: 0x8290\n      Vendor ID: 0x05ac (Apple Inc.)\n      Version: 1.69\n      Manufacturer: Broadcom Corp.\n      Location ID: 0x14300000\n\n\nA: From our exchange in comments, we've seen that your visible symptoms are caused by the drive falling off USB. Given your earlier debugging findings:\n\n\n*\n\n*A different external drive works\n\n*Tried a different USB cable\n\n*Tried different USB port\n\n*Tried it on another computer w/ same result\n\n\nit's clear that this is a problem with the WD My Passport, not your Mac or cable.\nThe next question is whether the issue inside the WD lies with the hard disk (HDD) itself or with the USB interface controller that it's attached to.\nYou will need to fully disassemble your WD in order to extract the HDD and attach it to a different USB interface controller, which you'll have to buy.\nIf I were you, I'd contact WD support first. This is their bug and they should repair or replace your drive. If you're out of warranty, then go ahead with the above troubleshooting step.\n", "Q: iCloud notes not syncing on iOS 8 on iPhone 6, but syncing on iOS 12 and iOS 15 I have 3 iPhones - iP 13 with iOS 15, iP 6 with iOS 12, iP 6 with iOS 8.1.2 (jailbroken).\nAll are signed into my iCloud account with Notes syncing enabled.\nI can see my iCloud notes only on my iOS 15 and iOS 12.\nAs for iOS 8.1.2, there are no notes here under the iCloud section. Wifi and mobile data are enabled.\nI have this device jailbroken, so I hesitate to upgrade it and lose that functionality.\nWithout updating the OS, what could be the reason, and how to solve this?\n\nA: At a guess, it's because the OS is too old to understand the current two-factor authentication methods.\nYou can update the 6 to iOS 12, which is new enough to understand.\nI just tested my old 5S & once I'd signed into iCloud again [with 2FA] then the Notes synced immediately.\nOn older Macs I've seen it's possible to get around this by entering your password followed by the authentication code, eg myPass123456. I don't know if this would also work for iOS.\nLate edit\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple) says there was a format change at iOS 9 which will explain it not working for iOS 8\n", "Q: Can a display's Power Delivery be turned off? my main machine is a 2016 15\" MacBook Pro and, working in print graphics, I usually have it connected to an external display (as of today, a Huawei MateView 28.2in).\nThis display has 65W power delivery and, when attached, it keeps the Mac's battery continuously topped off. This practice is known to wear the battery so I was wondering whether it was possible to have the screen connected AND not charge the laptop unless I tell it to.\nMaybe there is some Terminal command to manage that?\nThank you\n\nA: Sounds like you’ve read most of the general advice.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\nWe have had machines like yours in the shop and we set quarterly reminders to unplug them all one night and let the batteries drain.\nOnce a year, we try to take all the portables in storage out and charge them to 75% and then power off to prevent deep discharge / low voltage failure, get them in averaging 50% charge for “storage”.\nI’m not convinced we prevent much repair since some batteries just don’t last the 1000 full charge cycles whether we baby them or just let them ride.\nI’m saying all this, since I know of no way via command line to influence charging. The newer macs slow down charging but that’s enabled by default, has an easy graphical switch and not some hidden / semi secret command.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094\nAnyone interested in delaying the eventual need to remove a rechargeable battery and/or replace it should update to 10.15.5 or later and enable optimized charging. The rest should set reminders to avoid empty and always full batteries by draining and then charging them several times a year when in service.\n", "Q: How do I reset/reinstall Safari without opening it? macOS 12.0.1\nM1 MacBook Pro 13\"\nEvery time I try to open the Safari browser it starts opening an infinite number of tabs of my previously opened tabs. This eventually freezes up the computer unless I quickly force kill Safari.\nAll searches online point how to reset Safari after opening it. Is there a way I can do this without opening the Safari browser?\n\nA: Clear the saved state files so that it doesn't try to reopen those tabs next time it starts.\nFrom Finder:\n\n*\n\n* Cmd ⌘   N \n\n* Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G  \n\n*Copy/paste ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Safari.savedState\nDelete the contents of that folder [data, window_7, windows] not the entire folder, as it's an alias.

But the main problem is that this drains the battery of the laptop!\nI already have virtual machines or Docker or Kubernetes already sucking out all the power.\nWith this update and the arrival of syspolicyd I practically cannot use my laptop as a mobile device! The battery will be drained.\nWhat I tried:\n\n*\n\n*suggestions from 2 StackExchange answers: syspolicyd is killing my battery on a new MacBook Pro, repeatedly scanning and re-scanning my Steam library\nand syspolicyd producing huge amount of read on disk\n\n\n*I tried to use AppPolice to limit the CPU usage, adding syspolicyd under APApplicationLimits but unfortunately it didn't help.\n\n\n*I already tried to debug what files are accessed by the process, using sudo lsof -c syspolicyd but everything looks fine: looks like it's accessing system files; nothing from my personal files.\n\n\n*I tried to block /usr/libexec/syspolicyd from keeping a 24/7 connection with Apple servers (they are continuously harvesting data from the users via syspolicyd), but that doesn't help either (looks like the TCP connection is still there, and Apple bypasses LuLu firewall). I blocked it in macOS Firewall but that doesn't do anything as well.\nHow do I prevent it from continuously hogging the CPU?\nHow do I eventually disable the service alltogether?\n\nA: I figured it out!\nSolution\ncheck in the macOS Console.app, filtering by syspolicyd.\nThere will be lines that are marked with a yellow dot .\nFind those where is reported something like:\n\nKernel Extension BLOCKED \"com.malwarebytes.mbam.rtprotection\"\n\nor\n\nKernel Extension BLOCKED \"org.pqrs.driver.Karabiner.VirtualHIDDevice.v061000\"\n\n\n*\n\n*In my case I've then found out that Malwarebytes' Kext was deprecated. Reinstalling fixed the extension.\n\n\n*With Karabiner, the re-install triggered again the request to enable the extension in System Preferences.\nIt finally asks to Allow the extension in \"Preferences\"->\"Privacy & Security\" ‼️\nSo, instead of cleaning manually, just download and re-install the most recent version of the software providing the extension, and suddenly syspolicyd will drop to zero % CPU usage‼️\n\nRationale\nApparently the issue is with extensions not being Allowed.\nEven though I am sure I've checked several times in Privacy&Security, there was no sign of any requested extension (so the OS fails to keep a memory record about that required permission).\nThis was leading the system to waste CPU cycles trying to load an unprivileged extensions and fail, cutting 1/3 of performance and battery life away.\nThis is a bug in the OS  but hopefully this fix will finally improve a lot of users that were left grudging without a clue and a down-performing \"upgraded\" system.\n\n", "Q: Formatting a USB Drive for use on Windows with FAT/exFat I would like to use my USB stick to transfer files to a Windows machine. Apple documentation says to use FAT or exFAT. However, the Disk Utility only offers APFS variants. (See screenshot.) How do I format a USB stick for Windows?\n(Macbook Pro Big Sur 11.6.1)\n\n\nA: You're trying to format the volume, not the entire drive.\nThis isn't obvious, as Apple chooses to present the user with only a volume view by default.\n\nView menu > Show all Devices or  Cmd ⌘   2  will switch to device view, from where it all becomes more apparent.\nYou then choose the device itself, rather than any of the volumes/partitions on it & all the format options will be open to you.\n\nMake sure to also select Scheme: MBR for best compatibility with other devices/OSes.\n\nA: In the Disk utility window, push cmd + 2 key and select the physical USB key, then erase and you will be able to select all options.\n", "Q: How to resurrect the iPhone 12? I have iPhone 12 64Gb, I got a notification that the memory was almost full, then I tried to delete a few apps from the phone, but it was weird because they still were on the screen like I tried to delete them, but nothing happen...

However, I never noticed VIRT values that were so consistently high before, and I was recently experimenting with taskpolicy usage, so I want to verify that things aren't broken.\nWhen I run htop, every process shows 0 for virtual memory usage, or at least 32.1G: \nAnd every Safari process has >100G: \nI stumbled onto the htop issue above, and I'm concerned about the behavior of my machine because every process has an excessively high VIRT value, and even top shows a total virtual memory size of 22T: \nIn comparison, the htop issue above only shows a handful of processes with high virt values. Likewise, Activity Monitor isn't showing any abnormal memory usage: \nIs this a bug in htop (or elsewhere)? A configuration mistake on my end? Or is it just the result of a change in how macOS calculates virtual memory?\nFor reference, I am currently running macOS Monterey 12.0.1 on a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro.\n\nA: The reason that many processes show 0 in the VIRT column, and the rest show a very value is simply that you're running htop as an ordinary user. Ordinary users are not allowed to inquire this information about processes owned by other users, so you'll see a 0 for those processes - and those started under your own user account have their actual values.\nYou can solve this issue simply by running htop with sudo like this:\nsudo htop\n\nAlso note: The values you're seeing are actually not excessive. These values do not indicate any kind of problem, error, bug, performance issue, or the like with your system.\n", "Q: What is the Bash DEFAULTS \"domain\" for changing [accessibility > display > colour Filters > tint]?

I'm trying to determine what type of dock I should get for my MacBook, but the problem I'm facing is that most TB3 docks I'm finding only support HDMI or DP monitors.\nI'm trying to find a dock, or some kind of adapter, that will support the following:\n\n*\n\n*Two 4K 60hz monitors that connect over TB3 (not HDMI, or DP)\n\n*Charging over TB3 (or with a built in power cable)\n\n*At least 1 USB-3 port so that I can plug by USB hub into it.\n\n*Plugs into my MacBook as either a single cable or a single unit that takes up two TB3 ports, so long as it's a single unit I can plug in.\n\nMy goal is to have only one cable plugged into my Mac Book. I'm really trying to avoid having to buy a dock that supports HDMI or DP for display because that would mean I'd also have to replace my monitor cables with HDMI or DP cables on top of buying a dock.\nI've already seen at least one similar question:\n\n*\n\n*Is there a 1 cable solution to connect 2 monitors in extended mode and charge a MacBook 15\" at the same time?\nBut the solution there is a dock that works with HDMI displays.\nIs there a type of dock that would support this? I'm not necessarily asking for a specific product. I just want to know what type of dock would achieve this.\nThe closest product I've found so far is this. But it only supports the two monitors and not charging on the same device (from what I can tell)\n\nI'm new to this forum, so if this question doesn't aline with the guidelines for this community I'll be happy to remove it.\n\nA: Thunderbolt 3 docks that I have seen have one TB3 connection for your computer (powered) and one TB3 port for devises as well as a mixture of other ports.\nIf your displays are TB3 you should be able to daisy chain them off the singe TB3 port. Otherwise, you would be best to revise one of the displays to connect via HDMI or DP.\nThis would provide a single cable to your computer solution.\nExamples of TB3 Powered Docks:\n\n*\n\n*CalDigit TS3 Plus\n\n*OWC 14-Point Thunderbolt 3 Dock\n", "Q: How to reset graphics driver under macOS? Screen static/garbage but only on internal display I have a Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" which suddenly developed a very odd and specific issue earlier today.\nWhen running only the internal display under macOS, the display is unusable - multicoloured garbage and static, moving across the screen.  Yet when I hook up an external display the problem disappears and both the internal display and the external one show macOS correctly.\nWhen rebooting and choosing the boot menu with only the internal display, all is well again.  When loading macOS, it's fine until about two thirds of the way through the progress bar, and then the static psychedelic freakouts happen again and you can't even see the login screen.  Again, hooking up an external display makes both displays work again, until the external one is disconnected (HDMI or Thunderbolt, makes no difference)\nWhen rebooting to Windows 10 Pro under Boot Camp, with just the internal display, everything is fine.  If I load from a Gparted Live USB I have, also fine.  If I boot a macOS installer, again fine, up until the point a clean install of macOS is performed.  It was running Catalina, but I've also tried Big Sur and El Capitan (which is what it shipped with from new I believe).  Booting to Recovery from any version of macOS, or Safe Boot, and no issues, perhaps because Metal GPU drivers aren't loading.  Not sure.\nHaving done fairly extensive testing before reaching out here, this leads me to believe it is a software issue with macOS because the internal Retina display clearly works.  I'm wondering if it's related to Display Scaling because I usually run it at the \"Look like 1440x900\" setting and for some reason when booting macOS, the  Apple logo and progress bar are smaller as if the scaling is applied from boot, and that's causing a macOS-only problem.\nI've looked for potential Terminal sudo commands I could use to try and force a display driver reset or some such, but have not found any yet.\nI've seen display faults on Macs before, but never anything like this.  It's incredibly bizarre and specific, not a complete display fault across the entire machine, just macOS when not Safe Booted.\nAny advice please?  I literally can't work out what the issue is.  And I don't want to just use it in Windows 10; it's a Mac, I need it running macOS and it needs to work when not hooked up to another display to get around the issue.\n\nA: I have the same MacBook model and the exact same issue. My current workaround is to use a display emulator (dummy hdmi plug) connected at all times but I am also interested in a better solution. In the iFixit forum (link below), I have been advised that the issue is likely from a faulty logic board, possibly the graphics MUX part. The reason it works in safe mode would be that the integrated GPU is bypassed (same for recovery mode and bootable usb I presume).\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/739408/\nThat said, I don't understand why the issue disappears on Windows 10 on your side (I haven't tried dual boot so far). I assume Windows 10 should make full use of the integrated GPU as does macos?\nOne thing I figured is that if I prevent the the following driver to load (AppleIntelBDWGraphics.kext), then I have a functional computer with safe mode graphics.\n", "Q: Stop notifying me about Monterey upgrade I'm running the latest version of Big Sur, and I'm not really interested in upgrading to Monterey at the moment (none of the enhancements interest me much). System Preferences keeps displaying a 1 badge, and when I open Software Update it just shows the upgrade to Monterey.\nSometimes when I go to the Software Update preference pane and click on \"More info...\" the badge goes away, but it comes back a little later. Is there a way to suppress these notifications?\nNone of the methods in Is it possible to STOP the 'Upgrade to macOS High Sierra' message that keeps stalking me? seem to be applicable in Big Sur. I don't want to disable checking for Big Sur updates, just the notification of the new major release.\n\nA: I have a job running in User Agents that runs this script every 300 seconds:\n#!/bin/bash\nBadge=$(defaults read com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs)\necho $Badge\nif [[ \"$Badge\" == *\"1\"* ]]; then\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs 0 ; killall Dock\nfi\n\n\nA: What I've done so far on my system (Catalina) is inserting a \"dummy\" file in Applications folder, which only me has the read & write permission, so macOS can not automatically download Monterey installer.\n\n*\n\n*Step 1: Open Terminal and go to Application folder cd /Applications\n\n*Step 2: touch \"Install macOS Monterey\" to create an empty file named \"Install macOS Monterey\" in the Applications folder.\n\nOnly the creator has the write permission for this file,the \"system\" user, which used by the system to download and install system apps and updates, only has read permission. So as long as the dummy file is put there, macOS will not download Monterey installer and prompt for update.\n\nA: This one worked for me and on Big Sur too\nExecute the following commands in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs 0 \nkillall Dock\n\nfrom\nhttps://osxdaily.com/2020/05/12/disable-red-badge-icon-system-preferences-macos/\n", "Q: Hide macOS Focus / Sleep notifications in Notification Center and on Lock Sceen Every time I open my Mac in the morning, I see the notification on my macOS Lock Screen:\n\n\nSleep\nOff\n\nWhen I get home from the gym and open my Mac, I see\n\nFitness\nOff\n\nHow can I hide this notification? Either completely, or, especially, hide it from the lock screen?\nSystem Preferences > Notifications & Focus > Notifications does not have an app section for \"Focus\" or \"Sleep\". I cannot find the app to uncheck the normal \"Show notifications on lock screen\" option.\nThe Focus tab does not seem to have any controls to control notifications for Focus modes.\nThis is the new Focus feature in macOS 12 Monterey.\n\nA: In the focus tab you can unselect Share Across Devices and then disable focus on the Mac completely. Seems to be the only way to “switch off” the notifications. It’s crazy that they forgot to add the option to hide the notification on a feature which is supposed to help you focussing.\nOn the other hand, focus on the Mac is unnecessary for me I’ve switched of most notifications anyway, so nothing lost.\n", "Q: How to rescale macOS output volume to be quieter My headphones are too loud for me. How can I resize macOS' volume control so that max volume is only 30% of the actual possible power output?\nAnd then I have fine control within the 0-30% range.\nAt the moment, 1 pixel from mute is still too loud in some environments.\n\nA: I don't know a software solution for this on current macOS versions (there are/were solutions up to macOS 10.15; they are likely using kernel extensions and thus don't work on macOS 11+), but you can solve it with hardware:\nSearch for \"headphones volume control adapter\". These are adapters you plug in between your Mac and you headphones which can lower the volume.\n", "Q: Bug in Preview: How do I hide slideshow controls when viewing a full screen PDF? Preview has two distinct kinds of full screen mode:\n\n*\n\n*The normal full screen mode that most macOS applications have (View > Enter Full Screen)\n\n*Preview's special slideshow mode (View > Slideshow)\n\nIn slideshow mode, whenever you move your mouse, slideshow controls will appear at the bottom of the screen. They look like this:\n\nHowever, since I upgraded to macOS Monterey, these controls also appear when I open a PDF in ordinary full screen mode. This is really annoying when I try to read and looks like a bug to me, as it wasn't there before.\nThe problem only occurs after the mouse pointer has been hidden at least once, which automatically happens after a few seconds of not moving it.\nIs there any way to disable the slideshow controls in normal full screen?\n\nEdit: In the meantime, I also noticed that the slideshow mode (that isn't particularly useful for PDFs but nevertheless exists) is now totally messed up: When you start the slideshow and press any key, Preview will end the slideshow, as can be seen in the View menu: The View > Slideshow menu entry is selectable again!\nI think this is related to the problem I asked about—the entire slideshow vs full screen logic is confused.\n\nA: I resolved the problem by updating macOS Monterey from 12.0.1 to 12.1.\nIt's not clear whether this update specifically addresses the bug, or the act of updating merely reset some settings with the effect of incidentally also solving the problem. I couldn't find any information on it in the various release notes for this update (What's New, Security Content, Dev Release Notes).\nSince this question has been raised multiple times and on multiple forums (e.g. Reddit: 1, 2; Apple Support Community: 1, 2), I'm adding some background:\nBefore the update\n\n*\n\n*The problem only occurred in Single Page or Two Pages display of a PDF, but never in Continuous Scroll.\n\n*The mouse pointer would disappear in full screen after a few seconds of no use. Then, after moving the mouse, the mouse pointer would appear together with the (unwanted) slideshow controls.\n\nAfter the update\n\n*\n\n*Now the mouse pointer doesn't automatically disappear any more when not used.\n\n*It is interesting to note, however, that you can make the mouse pointer disappear manually by pressing any key, such as a letter or number, that is not a function key. If you then move the mouse again, the mouse pointer will reappear without triggering the slideshow controls. I'm guessing that this has already been a feature before the update.\n\nFrom this, it seems most likely that Apple had accidentally enabled the entire \"hide mouse when not used & show slideshow controls when mouse is moved again\" behaviour in full screen.\nHopefully this bug is now fixed and won't re-emerge.\n", "Q: Can you decrease the width of a video in a video call on Macbook I use a Lenovo webcam that I connect to Macbook Pro using usb. When I am in meetings, the camera shows my entire room because it has this Ultrawide feature. Is there any way i can decrease the width of the video?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: A slightly involved solution would be to use the free software package OBS.\nIt is a complete video broadcasting system - but in this particular case you could use it to take in the video from your webcam, crop it and then make it available again as a virtual web camera. On video calls you would select this virtual web camera as the video source.\nNote their guide on virtual cameras as some software might require a few extra steps - that is the case if your video meetings take place over for example Microsoft Teams or Skype. Try it first without the extra steps, and then use that guide if it doesn't work.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 14-inch M1 Pro battery drain while sleeping My new 14-inch MacBook Pro (M1 Chip macOS Monterey 12.0.1) uses a lot of battery during sleep mode.

You can reset it via:\nsudo xcode-select --reset\n\nYou can download the command line tools (that you're going to need if you don't have a full Xcode installed) via:\nxcode-select --install\n\nOr if you have Xcode installed, select it:\nsudo xcode-select --switch <path_to_Xcode.app>\n\n\nA: I'm hoping the answer linked below helps, i.e.\nxcode-select --install\n\nupdating OS requires updating xcode\n(It did.)\n", "Q: Will MacBook be re-added to Find My?

Following this answer\nhttps://superuser.com/a/1025007/642458\nI tried to install tree from source. Running make install the first time, I got this output:\n...$ make install\ninstall -d /usr/local/bin\ninstall: chmod 755 /usr/local/bin: Operation not permitted\ninstall -d /usr/share/man/man1\ninstall: chmod 755 /usr/share/man/man1: Read-only file system\nif [ -e tree ]; then \\\n        install tree /usr/local/bin/tree; \\\n    fi\ninstall: /usr/local/bin/tree: Permission denied\nmake: *** [install] Error 71\n\nSince the answer mentions using sudo, I ran sudo make install, which worked for what it concerns moving the tree binary to /usr/local/bin, but not for what it concerns adding the man pages:\ninstall -d /usr/local/bin\ninstall -d /usr/share/man/man1\ninstall: chmod 755 /usr/share/man/man1: Read-only file system\nif [ -e tree ]; then \\\n        install tree /usr/local/bin/tree; \\\n    fi\ninstall doc/tree.1 /usr/share/man/man1/tree.1\ninstall: /usr/share/man/man1/tree.1: Read-only file system\nmake: *** [install] Error 71\n\nHowever, I'm now afraid that I changed the permissions for my system folders!

The directory for the man files is hard coded incorrectly.\nThe top is correct\nBINDIR=${prefix}/bin\nMAN=tree.1\nMANDIR=${prefix}/man/man1\n\nUnfortunately the OSX bit hard codes MANDIR you need to edit that line to the one above.\nI would note this is not a good makefile - as things like MANDIR and BINDIR are set in several places. These should be set at the end of the configuration and the OSX bit just sets prefix and the compiler options (or perhaps better all installs should be with PREFIX=/usr/local for all Unix OS).\nNow reading the details of the link it is worse - the original author of the source code got it correct but the hacks to make it build are wrong. The correct way is in a comment in the answer\n\nWell, this technically works. But it’s invasive. So you could probably run ./configure --prefix=/usr/local before running make and make install and it would achieve the same results.\n\nI have not tried this so can't be certain it works - I would use Macports (or Homebrew) where someone else has already done the hard work of portting the build to macOS and also they provide a binary so you don't even need to compile it yourself. Macports also keeps the directory permissions as they should be for Unix (Homebrew does require some messing around with directory permissions but just /usr/local )\nAs for chnages to the file system re permissions etc. Thje security is working and you made no chnages. macOS stopped the only commands that change permissions chmod\nTo check run ls -ld directory for any directory you might be worried about.\n", "Q: What is the use for the half bottom screen mode in iPhone? On my iPhone, if I swipe the bottom of any app downward, the app size shrink to the bottom half of the screen as shown in the following screenshot.\nWhat is this for?

Many people can't reach the left or right upper corner when holding their phone in one hand. This feature allows you to use the upper part of your screen without switching your hand position while holding.

An elderly relative has just moved into in a nursing home that has 1 WiFi network which is used by all staff, residents, and guests. There is no password: You just select the WiFi and you are connected. Prior to moving into the nursing home, my relative would use AirPlay to stream subscription content from an iPad app to a TV (via AppleTV), but that was on a WiFi network that no one else could use.\nIs it safe to do this on an essentially open WiFi network? If not, what are the security risks? The iPad and AppleTV are both running up-to-date versions of the OS.\nI can't think of any practical alternative; in particular, my relative was not able to learn how to use a smart TV because it was too complex.\nEdit: Sorry, I wasn't as clear as I could have been. My concern is less with the iPad end than with AppleTV, i.e., the ability to buy/rent things from it, the ability to send unwanted content to it, etc. I think that these are unlikely given it would have the same AppleID as the iPad, but have never used one on an open network before.\n\nA: Make sure the iPad is not jailbroken. Otherwise, on an open WiFi network, an attacker may be able to ssh in to the iPad and do all kinds of nasty things.\n\nA: On the AppleTV set up a pin so that people won’t accidentally start streaming if they can’t see the actual TV. One good thing, AirPlay will work even if you’re not on WiFi so it will negotiate and work and go peer to peer if that’s better for image quality in my experience.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202618\nThe pin is nice, since you can have friends over and let them share photos too, but locking down with a secure AppleID on both devices is the most private since no one will even see the device advertise on the network.\nWe host AppleTV on guest networks and in common spaces in my apartment and it works very well - AppleTV is easy to wipe and update too, so that helps with ongoing security.\n\nA: Unless there are known security flaws in Airplay, I would think that this is a relatively low risk activity. If you really feel uneasy about it though, you should be able to negate the security risks of using unprotected wi-fi by utilizing private VPN software. One example is the mozilla VPN: \nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/\n", "Q: Connect 2 4K monitors to a M1 Pro laptop via Thunderbolt 4 dock?

I found this related question on Apple forums, and some answers there say it's possible.\nBut then I asked the specific question there myself, and got an opposite answer.\nI called Apple, and the rep also said that this is not possible even with the M1 Max (only one monitor per port), but I am not 100% confident in their knowledge.\nPeople here are sharing their personal experiences and confirming that it does work with specific setups.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to connect two external 4K60 monitors to a M1 Pro macbook using a single Thunderbolt 4 port, more specifically using a dock?\n\nNo, it's not possible.  There are exceptions that I'll get into but generally no, that is not possible.  This has been a long time complaint of Apple computers and it does not appear Apple is going to change this.\nThe main issue is Apple does not support MST, multi-stream transport, over DisplayPort.  This means one port supports only one display.\nApple states on their website that computers with M1 and Thunderbolt 4 support only one display per port. It's in their support page on connecting displays: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351\nAnd on identifying ports: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201736\nThe exceptions to this are displays controlled by a separate GPU.  Someone could plug in a dock with a DisplayPort output and USB, and then use a USB GPU like those made by DisplayLink to drive the second display.  Some docks have DisplayLink GPUs built-in to them for multiple displays.  Another means to get an external GPU is with a box that is clearly labeled an external GPU.  These are docks with a primary function of adding additional graphics processing, though this processing is available to be used on an internal display as well as external displays.  These eGPU docks will tend to have other ports like USB and Ethernet but some do not as their function is to be a GPU, not a general purpose dock, and so may lack such ports as they take valuable bandwidth.\nIf connecting two displays by one Thunderbolt cable is important to you then you are going to have to pay for it.  There is no cheap resolution to this.  Windows will support two displays on a single Thunderbolt port but you pay for it in a different way, lower video performance.  Two 4K@60 displays on one Thunderbolt port is asking a lot, if it works at all then it's likely by \"cheating\" with compressed video.  Maybe the math works out and no cheating required but it's getting real close to the limits of the cables.\nDisplayLink and eGPU get by with less bandwidth on the cable to the computer because the video is still a stream of descriptive bits at that point.  After processing into the full uncompressed video frame there's more data.  After processing there is more bandwidth consumed on the cable to the display, one 4K@60Hz consumes more data than one DisplayPort channel can hold.  Supporting two 4K displays means using all 4 \"superspeed\" channels in the USB-C cable for video, leaving no channels for Thunderbolt or USB 3.x, or multiplexing the DisplayPort video into the same \"superspeed\" channels, which is a feature not all displays and docks support.  I speculate but it's likely safe to assume Apple didn't want to confuse users with the long list of technical requirements on what is needed to get two displays on one Thunderbolt port to work and simply says it is not supported.  They \"enforce\" this limitation by not including MST support in their OS and drivers, without MST there's no multiplexing two DisplayPort streams on one cable.\n\nA: Yes this is possible.\nI'm doing this with a Thunderbolt 3 dock. Specifically HP G2 Thunderbolt Dock G2. The crux is to connect one display to the DisplayPort and the other to a Thunderbolt port (provided your dock has one). Based on the specs listed on Apple’s website your MacBook is capable of running 2x 6K@60. The dock merely acts as Thunderbolt pass through. So you should be good.\nThis is inline with the statement in Apple's support article About the Thunderbolt ports on Mac:\n\nDepending on your Mac, you may be able to connect multiple Thunderbolt devices to each other, then connect the chain of devices to the Thunderbolt port on your Mac. See Use one or more external displays with your Mac.\n\nDell has instructions for this specific setup (2x 4K@60Hz) with their WD19TB Dock:\n\nDell also instructs to connect one display to the Thunderbolt port on the dock and the other to Displayport or HDMI.\nWirecutter mentions a similar setup in their review of Thunderbolt docks:\n\nThe second Thunderbolt port allows you to pass through data from Thunderbolt accessories. You can hook up two 4K monitors at 60 Hz, too,\n\nOWC, known for its Mac accessories, also has a dock that can do this. On the page about this dock, they refer to an infographic on Thunderbolt.\nMy specs below for reference.\n\nApple M1 Pro:\n\n  Chipset Model:    Apple M1 Pro\n  Type: GPU\n  Bus:  Built-In\n  Total Number of Cores:    14\n  Vendor:   Apple (0x106b)\n  Metal Family: Supported, Metal GPUFamily Apple 7\n  Displays:\nDELL U2518D:\n  Resolution:   2560 x 1440 (QHD/WQHD - Wide Quad High Definition)\n  UI Looks like:    2560 x 1440 @ 60.00Hz\n  Main Display: Yes\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Rotation: Supported\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  Yes\nColor LCD:\n  Display Type: Built-in Liquid Retina XDR Display\n  Resolution:   3024 x 1964 Retina\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  No\n  Connection Type:  Internal\nDELL P2417H:\n  Resolution:   1920 x 1080 (1080p FHD - Full High Definition)\n  UI Looks like:    1920 x 1080 @ 60.00Hz\n  Mirror:   Off\n  Online:   Yes\n  Rotation: Supported\n  Automatically Adjust Brightness:  Yes\n\n\nA: This one will do it with one cable.

However, it had been improved with M1 Pro Mac and M1 Max Mac systems(released after 10/2021.\nThe new M1 Pro or M1 Max Mac systems can support up to 6 external monitors at the same time totally.\nI had tested and proofed this new video supported capacity with the new M1 Pro/ M1 Max accordingly.\nI added a Thunderbolt 4 HUB or Thunderbolt 4 dock to any of built-in Thunderbolt 4 ports on the Mac systems and the HUB/docks have up to 3 Thunderbolt ports or video ports on it.\n", "Q: Best cloud alternative to a Mac AFP onsite file system I have a publishing company as a client that has asked me to help them migrate an outdated Mac server to a cloud based model so they would be able to have a more resilient system, as well as easily accommodate some tasks that are currently not able to be done outside of the office.\nAfter looking into different systems to help accommodate this the main hurdle I seem to be running into is the user authentication pieces as this is a security step that we are feeling is necessary since ultimately they will have their entire staff on this system and as they leave they would like some control over access.\nMy question is, since this is something I feel like a lot of organizations did a few years ago, what was the prefered path? Did you end up moving to a windows server, or just running a mac server in AWS, or did you use a different file system to accommodate the future growth you were projecting for the organization?\nI did see this post on here, and it almost answers the questions, but we are wanting a solution that can lock files while they are being viewed if possible.\nThe team is currently about 15 people, and we are wanting to find the most cost effective solution while still utilizing something similar to the process they have now where they use the \"Connect to Server\"  feature on the mac to mount the shared drive onto their desktop. I have found a few similar solutions, but ones like this feel a little outdated, and then you have a system that AWS manages that is a bit expensive for the amount of people utilizing it.\nIs there even a happy median between old software and expensive enterprise level for something like this?\nThank you for all of your suggestions in advance!\n\nA: If all they want is simple on-prem shared storage, then a couple NAS boxes could work. With that many people, they should have at least one dedicated person dedicated to managing things, ensuring backups are working, etc.... Configure one as the storage and use the other as a backup. Synology is a good place to start looking. Another economical backup option is Backblaze.\nThey are big enough that they really should be looking at something like Google Workspaces or Microsoft 365 which will support the security and management features that are necessary in a larger environment. I think they can afford the ~$200/mo. cost and will get a heck of a lot more for their money.\n", "Q: Sidecar Constantly Crashes in Congested Network Environments When I use Sidecar between my M1 Air and my 2nd Gen Ipad Pro 12.9\" at coffeeshops, I get near constant crashes and poor connectivity, whereas it works much better at home.\nI downloaded a wifi analyzer app to look at the network bands, and found that I only have performance issues when there is another local wifi network which projects on the same band as the network I am currently on. (using WiFi Explorer Lite)\n\nSo I bought a portable router, and manually configured the band to be 20Mhz and to be on a channel that ostensibly looks the clearest. For some time, this has improved my Sidecar performance, but it is still not perfect.\nSometimes it will work perfectly after failing to start it several times, and others I will not be able to get it to work no matter what I do. I've noticed I always fail to start it if I have a Zoom meeting in progress.\nI had previously determined that Sidecar fails most when the ping is most unreliable. I did repeated ping tests and found that I have a really poor average ping at the coffeeshop I'm at as shown here:\n\nI suspect Sidecar times out and crashes if the ping is too high, with a maximum shown here of 600Ms, and a 90Ms standard deviation for the packet ping, which is terrible.

Sidecar is such a pivotal feature, if only it worked!!\n\nA: I resolved this issue by using it with a wired connection. I bought a 18w tiny PD Charger, a 10' usb C cable to connect the charger to my M1 Air, and a 3' USB C to lightning to connect the M1 Air to my Ipad.\nWith this setup, sidecar works 100% of the time and the hardware required is pretty light and compact.\nWith a more power hungry Mac, replace the 18w PD charger with a charger sufficient for your Mac.\n", "Q: Spinning gray wheel in mac internet accounts when adding or modifying google logins I was getting the spinning gray wheel hang when adding or modifying google accounts when Google Chrome was set as my default browser\n\n\nA: Setting Safari as my default browser allowed the login to pop up correctly\n\nA: I ran into the same problem.

So, I have three USB A devices.\n\n*\n\n*Logitech wired keyboard\n\n*Logitech wireless mouse with a USB A receiver\n\n*Logitech webcam\n\nIn my previous job, I was given a Lenovo Windows laptop. I had a USB 3.0 switch that I bought from Amazon. I used it to switch my devices between my Desktop computer and office laptop.\nNow I switched jobs and I was given a 2019 16\" MacBook Pro. I purchased a USB A to C cable and I tried to hook the USB 3.0 Switch to my MacBook Pro, but the MacBook is not recognizing the devices attached to the switch.\nWhat can I purchase? What can I do in this situation? My desk does not have enough space for another set of mouse, keyboard, & webcam.\n\nA: Let me guess, the USB switch looks something like this one:\n\nI suspect the reason the USB switch is not working any more is because the switch was designed in a way that violated the USB specification, using USB-A ports for both input and output, and you bought a cable for it that adheres to the USB specification.\nUsing USB-A ports for input is not just violating the USB specifications but is a potential fire hazard.  The USB-A to USB-A cables that your switch almost certainly came with will connect the power supply pins straight through, if these cables are mistaken for cables that do comply with the USB specification (which will comply by not connecting the power supply pins) and are used to connect two computers together the cable will short circuit the power supplies and potentially break or burn something.  A USB-C to USB-A cable that complies with the USB specification, which is most likely the kind you bought, will not supply power to the USB switch.  No power to the switch means no power to the devices, and no power to the devices means they will not work.\nAgain I am speculating here because you did not provide a description of your USB switch.  I've seen these kinds of switches before, they appear to be popular.  They are likely popular because they are cheap.  They are cheap because they used a cheap design that does not meet the USB specifications.\nWhat should you do about it?  Throw away the switch and the cables, then be thankful they didn't cause damage to anything.  Then buy a USB switch, or KVM switch, that meets the USB specifications.  How do you know the product meets the USB specifications?  Look for USB certification on the box or in the product description.\n\nThe USB connectors should have the trademarked icon.\n\nIt's not illegal to sell cheap junk but it is illegal to put trademarked icons on items for sale without permission.  Cheap junk will not get the attention of lawyers but use of trademarks without permission will.  These products that violate the USB spec remain on the market by not using any trademarks, and through clever wording of their claims.  They claim, \"Compatible with most USB devices.\"  It doesn't work with your USB device?  Well, they didn't claim it was compatible with every device.  They didn't claim to meet any testing for compatibility.  Or claim to meet any testing for safety.  It's sold \"as is\", if it doesn't work for you then that's on you.\nOne more time, I'm speculating on the source of the problem since you didn't specify the model of USB switch you have, I'm making an educated guess.  It appears you already suspect the USB switch is the source of the problem and I agree.\n\nA: You can only connect a USB hub via the Thunderbolt ports on the MacBook Pro.\nYou CAN NOT connect a USB Switch via the Thunderbolt ports on the MacBook Pro.\nMacGuffin is correct 100% that is the USB protocol designed for. Upstream port can not become downstream port at the same time in this case.\nYou should have a DisplayPort KVM switch instead.\nPut a docking station between your MBP and the KVM switch.\nAnd plug all the shared monitor(s), keyboard, mouse and other sharing devices to the console connections of the KVM switch.\n", "Q: On Monterey, where are the downloaded wallpapers saved?

Being a more primitive data structure, GPT mandates that each partition (of which you currently have three) is one contiguous block, with a single starting point, a single ending point, and no gaps in between.\nThe second of your three partitions is the APFS Container, whose contents are detailed in the bottom half of the diskutil output you provided. Within this container, any free space is available as a common pool across all volumes, because APFS was designed to have this as a key feature.\nHowever, beyond the APFS partition is a separate Bootcamp partition. This is why there isn't a clean way to reclaim your 20 GB of free space back into Macintosh HD: The APFS container, which holds Macintosh HD, ends where the Bootcamp partition begins. The APFS container can't skip past another, separate partition in order to reach your unallocated space.\nYou would need to delete your Bootcamp partition and then grow the APFS partition by 20 GB, and then (if you still want it) recreate and repopulate Bootcamp.\n\nA: There are third party tools that can move the Windows partition (disk0s3), so the free space appears after the macOS partition (disk0s2). Once moved, the command below can be used to add the free space to the macOS partition (disk0s2).\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nOne free third party tool that can move the Windows partition is GParted. Basically, you create a bootable GParted USB flash drive, boot from this flash drive and use Gparted to move the Windows partition. Afterwards, boot back to macOS and use the above command to add the free space to the macOS partition (disk0s2).\n\nI should point out that GParted can also be booted from an optical drive or a partition on the internal drive. The instructions for doing so are not included in this answer.\n\nI should warn that you would be moving a lot of data, which could take a considerable amount of time. Also, if the move operation is interrupted, you probably would not be able to recover and the Windows partition would be lost.\nOther References\n\n*\n\n*ntfsresize(8) - Linux man page\n\n*NTFS Partition Boot Sector\n", "Q: Make all displays black I use my MacBook with the internal display and two screens attached, so 3 displays in total.

Consider that I have a very simple table where the first column is a header column :\n\n\n\n\nStuff (header column)\nThings\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n\n\n2\n2\n\n\n3\n3\n\n\n10\n1\n\n\n20\n0\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to plot the curve of Things as a function of Stuff, but since Stuff is not linear, I cannot use the 2D Line Plot because it does not scale the X-axis according to the values, they are spaced evenly. However, when I try to use a 2D Scatter Plot, I cannot select the Stuff column to be the X values. This simply does not work.\nI can bypass this limitation with workarounds such as:\n\n*\n\n*remove the header column, create the scatter plot, then make it again a header column; and\n\n*going to the \"Series\" menu and selecting the column manually.\n\nHowever, this does not work in every situation, for instance, if the table is a Pivot Table (a recent feature) then I cannot use the Series menu nor remove the header columns.\nLast, another related issue I'm facing: contrary to a line plot, I cannot find a way to change the intervals/steps between X-axis values, they seem to be automatically arranged.

Is there any solution to make it work properly or should I use a better-suited software that allows selecting any column with our restriction?.\n\nEdit\nI tried the solution highlighted in this question, which basically says to look at this Apple documentation.\nHowever, I'm not able to reproduce the solution in my specific case, i.e. when the first column is a header column. The Apple documentation says that for a Scatter Plot you can select a column by clicking the letter of the column, but it does not work for a header column.\n\nA: \nHowever, when I try to use a 2D Scatter Plot, I cannot select the Stuff column to be the X values. This simply does not work.\n\nIdeally, you can't use the cells in a header column as x-coordinates of the series you wish to put in a scatter chart in Numbers as of v11.2. I reckon a header column is meant to include category names in Numbers (but there is no option to put them on a scatter chart either!). However, as you have stated, it is possible to work around the header-column-as-x-coordinates limitation somewhat easily when one is not getting the data for the scatter chart from a pivot table.\n\nHowever, this does not work in every situation, for instance, if the table is a Pivot Table (a recent feature) then I cannot use the Series menu nor remove the header columns.\n\nIf the x-coordinates happen to be the first column of a pivot table, the workaround I can suggest is to have a second column in your data table, with the same values with the column to appear as the first column in the pivot table, and include the extra column as per appropriate in the pivot table. Here is an example:\n\n\nI cannot find a way to change the intervals/steps between X-axis values, they seem to be automatically arranged. Is there a way to put specific values?\n\nIf you wish to be able to set the limits of the x-axis on a Numbers chart or have the x-coordinates of the series or the x-axis labels displayed in the chart in a scaled fashion with respect to the x-axis limits, you need to use either a scatter or a bubble chart. All the other chart types in Numbers, AFAIK, place the x-axis labels, and therefore the x-coordinates of the series being plotted, without scaling, even if the x-coordinates are dates or numbers.\n\nIs there any solution to make it work properly or should I use a better-suited software that allows selecting any column with our restriction?\n\nUnless you use the workarounds, you can not use the cells in a header column as the x-coordinates of a series in a scatter chart in Numbers as of yet. Even if possible, the workaround gets a bit cumbersome to implement if the table is a pivot table. If you are planning to use many different pivot tables with scatter charts or frequently change the structures of your pivot tables used with scatter charts, it might be more convenient for you to use a different spreadsheet software.\n", "Q: How can I recover app data from iCloud? I am a European resident trying to recover years of text/photo diary entries from an iPhone app called Momento.  The app lost my on-device data and does not seem to recognize my iCloud backup.  It clearly exists, however, as you can see below.  Apple Support told me to contact the developer, but a week in, the developer has not responded.\nI used the Apple Data and Privacy feature to download iCloud data, but I got only my iCloud Drive files, not the 4.1 GB in the Momento CloudKit(?) partition.\nI understand that Apple would like me to make a GDPR request to the developer, and I already have.  However, given that this data resides on Apple’s iCloud servers, can I get the data from Apple, possibly via a GDPR request?  How would I do so?\n\n\nA: Apple has a data privacy page that covers how to make requests for your data stored by Apple.\n\nFrom there, request your other data:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://privacy.apple.com/\nOpening a case with apple after inspecting the other data might be needed - I can’t test your bucket as I don’t have that app or data stored against that container type / identifier.\nHopefully that bucket is not end to end encrypted, since Apple does not provide that data as a standard or listed non-standard request on the data request faq. your data seems to meet the other two requirements,\n\nAny data that isn’t provided is either in a form that is not personally identifiable or linked to your Apple ID, is stored in an end-to-end encrypted format that Apple cannot decrypt, or is not stored by Apple at all.\n\nI have emphasized the exception you may be facing. Also, have you ever made any backups of the phone? You might still have that data on the phone and be able to retrieve it from a physical / local backup since you will control encryption and/or have access to the keys if the backup does get (or was done) encrypted.\nIn your case if you sign in to iCloud on a new(ish) version of macOS you should get all the files synchronized to your home folder library.\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents\n\nIf your application identifier is com.d3i.momento then it's data should be located in the folder iCloud~com~d3i~momento within the Mobile Documents portion of your library if the developer just stored apps within the app bundle. If they stored the data inside a group bundle, there will be letters and numbers before the folder like F6266T9T75~iCloud~com~d3i~momento\n\nA: For this specific app: you need to turn iCloud on in settings and then be very patient with \"Restore Backup.\"  I had to try about 6 times before anything came back, then got only a partial restore.  I then re-restored and everything came back.\nApparently a lot of this has to do with iCloud itself being a little wonky/unpredictable, so my takeaway is that if you have GB of app data stored in iCloud, prepare for a lot of errors and re-tries.\n", "Q: Memory Pressure in yellow with new MacBook Pro M1 Pro (14 inch / 16GB RAM ) I recently purchased a new MacBook Pro 14 inch model (16GB RAM and 8 core CPU).\nThe new laptop is running just fine. It's super fast. However, memory pressure is usually in the yellow. On my old system (MacBook Pro mid 2018 with 16GB RAM), I was hardly ever in the yellow.\nEven when memory pressure is in the yellow on the new system, the computer seems totally fine - no fan, no lag, nothing.\nShould I consider upgrading to 32GB? Something seems off about this memory pressure. I read something about this possibly being a bug in macOS Monterey. I don't want to needlessly upgrade for budget reasons.\nCan anyone advise?\n\n\n***** UPDATE *****\nAfter updating my system to Monterey 12.1, memory pressure has improved. It's still often in yellow but I'm not noticing any performance issues.\n\nA: The only number here that may be abnormally high is that of Photoshop, at 6.48 GB, and that's high only if you have just opened the app with no open documents yet. I seem to recall that Photoshop has its own memory management system that is very grabby and it maintains a private cache of documents and operations histories which it will hold on to until there is internal memory pressure. Make sure you're capturing these screenshots right after rebooting your Mac and first opening Photoshop so that nothing is cached yet and we're seeing the \"baseline\" state.\nI should note that 16 GB isn't a lot for a dev/design machine these days, and it will only get worse as the years go on and software naturally bloats. Also note that part of your memory is being used for VRAM so you'll have less than 16 GB available for app runtime. You may be setting yourself up for frustration a few years down the road when you realize you just don't have enough physical memory to keep up. (BTW, you can't \"upgrade\" your MBP to 32 GB; you have to sell it and buy a new machine. Apple stopped allowing user upgrades of DRAM years ago. From your question it's not clear that you're aware of this fact.)\nOTOH, bugs happen, and you may be experiencing a software fault that's causing a steady leak. If so, it will likely get fixed and you'll be in better shape.\nFor now, if you want something actionable, we should try to understand where all this memory is going. Let's collect more information. First, in Activity Monitor, make sure you are displaying the \"Real Private Memory\" column (View > Columns > Real Private Memory) and do a descending sort by it.\nNext, let's pick an app that you think is using excessive real private memory. Run the vmmap -w command on it using its (partial) process name or process ID (PID). For example:\nvmmap -w Photoshop\n\nUpload a text file with the output to something like www.PasteBin.com and amend your question with a link to it and we'll take a look to see where allocations are highest.\n\nA: Certainly, the new M1s have shown themselves to perform remarkably, even under very high memory pressure and with high swap usage.\nAs you yourself say, the performance is 'fine'.\nBut, RAM requirements are only likely to increase, and more RAM is always better than less RAM. The system uses that RAM for the GPU and CPU, so if you're using an external monitor and/or running tasks that use the GPU a lot (which Photoshop is likely to do), then RAM usage will be higher than on an Intel with discrete GPU.\nIf you decide to go for 32GB, you'll need to return the MBP to Apple for a refund, and then buy another. The RAM is part of the System-on-a-chip. The refund period is usually 14 days, but if you smile sweetly, you may get some latitude.\n(I have also seen reports of notable memory leaks in Monterey, but that's likely to be fixed in the short term.)\n", "Q: How to create non-repeating \"Time of Day\" automations?

I'm curious, and M1/ARM64/Apple Silicon MacBooks are incredibly efficient, so I am exploring using smaller power sources like my (genuine Apple) 10W/2.1A iPad AC charger. But I wonder: Why is it reported as supplying only 5W when powering my new M1 MacBook?\nAlso, I have some (brand name) USB-C cables I'd like to use with it but I hear that folks have problems with non-Apple power sources (presumably eBay chabuduo 'brand') frying M1 Macs, so I'll be testing them with other USB-C equipment.\n\nA: Why may a (genuine Apple) 10W/2.1A iPad AC charger† not adequately power an M1 MacBook?\nThere are so many reasons and caveats!\n\n*\n\n*Because the Mac can pull more than 5 watts (the default/old USB standard) only from a modern USB power supply that supports \"USB Power Delivery\", A.K.A. USB-PD.  (And most tasks will need a little or a lot more power than this.)  Why?  The M1 MacBooks do not speak the proprietary signal protocol older Apple kit uses to support 10 watts over USB. The M1 MacBook doesn't try to use the old protocol to signal to the power supply that it wants 10 watts, so it only gets 5.\n\n\n*Newer (than iPhone 7, genuine Apple) iPhone and iPad AC chargers tend to support USB-PD, and thus can send their nameplate power to an M1 MacBook. Again, older ones do not. (specs: Apple iPad 10W USB Power Adapter )\n\n\n*Lower watt USB power adapters that support USB-PD are becoming more common over time. A USB power adapter that doesn't support USB-PD might supply enough power to slow the discharge from the battery to a standstill if the Mac is doing very little, but it is more likely to discharge than charge to the battery. (I have seen both happen.) After connecting a 10 watt USB power adapter to my M1 MacBook Air, it will show as charging in System Preferences but simultaneously (yes, with a refresh) show as not charging in System Information.  The battery of a MacBook under heavy load, may discharge even when supplied by a 15 or 20 watt adapter.\n\n\n*UPDATE: YMMV indeed!   2 days later, I accidentally discovered that with the same charger and Mac, but a counterfeit Apple cable (it came with AirPod Pros that were also counterfeit but in a real Apple box) instead of the Baseus cable used above,  and connected thru a USB power meter, the Mac shows as charging in System Preferences and per System Information, which says it's being delivered 8 Watts. (7.1 Watts per the USB power meter).  </me throws up hands!>  I had thought the Baseus cable would be of good quality, but it seems I was mistaken.  And either this old 10W Apple charger supports USB-PD, or the M1 supports the Apple-proprietary protocol.  This proves the following point! =>\nMore (real-world) caveats.\n4. If you have a cheap (in both senses of the word) USB cable, it could well be only a 2-wire cable, so the data lines that are used to negotiate Apple's proprietary USB power protocol, as well as USB-BD, won't work.\n\n*\n\n*I have noticed that significantly more power can be pulled over shorter USB cables at 5V than over longer cables (e.g. 2.1A over 6\"(~15cm), as low as 1.2A over a (non-defective) 6'(~180cm)).\n\n\n*Similarly, if there's a bad data line connection, only 5W will be supplied.\n\n\n*Also, a device with a Li-ion battery that's almost full (>~80%) will not charge it quickly, as this damages it, so don't let this mislead you.\n\n\n*Apple says, \"If your Mac uses USB-C to charge, you can charge your Mac notebook with any USB-C power adapter or display.  For the best charging experience, you should use the power adapter and cable included with your Mac notebook.\"2  But I suggest not being unnecessarily adventurous about the chargers or cables you use with an M1 due to the reports I've heard.  On the other hand, I've not entirely followed this advice and so far so good:\na. using an Apple 10W charger with Power Delivery, as noted above, depending on usage, one can get away with a tiny power adapter for a traveling M1 MacBook.\nb. using a eero/Google, I get 15 watts and the battery does charge if I'm just doing what I'm doing now.\nc. I later found a knock-off of Apple's 10W charger, but I'm going to take my advice and not try to plug my M1 into it. - 2nd UPDATE!\n\n\n*See Apple's \"About Apple USB power adapters\" (and the less informative \"About Mac power adapters\", AKA \"Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook.\") for more info.\n\n\n*I suggest you believe Apple when they say their power supplies are safer.  Trust me or search for \"Bunnie\" Huang and other's teardowns, e.g. on YouTube and do a bunch of research to see how dangerous some can be.  Not chabuduo at all.  Cheap ones often fail, and good (e.g. UL certified) ones are designed so that when they fail, they don't fail catastrophically (cause a fire).  Much lower cost with lower reliability parts can work, but only if the design still follows safety principles.\n\n(Some content from \" Other than speed, is there a reason that a 10W iPad charger shouldn't charge a new MacBook Pro 2016? \")\n†Or 'brick', but that term hasn't make sense since the old school adapters built around a transformer consisting of a metal, brick-heavy core wound with copper wire were made largely illegal.  Such adapters are often called vampires because they suck the same amount of power whether the device they're powering needs it or not; solid state devices made this inefficiency needless and is why they were made largely illegal.  So many other names. Power supply.  A/C adapter. etc. [edit me]\n", "Q: Auto schedule Ethernet to activate/inactivate I use a USB-C Ethernet dongle on my MacBook Pro. I frequently find it has stopped working and suspect it's due to the dongle overheating.\nI'd like to automate this sequence:\n\n*\n\n*Inactivate Ethernet at 1am (after I go to bed).\n\n*Activate Ethernet at 7am (before I start working).\n\nIs that possible by Automator or by a 3rd party app?\n\nA: Have you tried automator ethernet toggle?\n\ndo shell script \"networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled \\\"Ethernet 1\\\" off\"\n\n...\nBut, since your entire AppleScript is, in fact, a shell command wrapped inside a do shell script command, then I'd recommend using an Execute Shell Script action in your Automator workflow instead of an AppleScript one. Then you can simply write the command out in its naked form, which is much more sensible:\n[[ \"$(networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1')\" = \"Enabled\" ]] \\\n&& networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' off \\\n|| networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' on\n\n\nIf this works, the AppleScript, Automator workflow, or shell script can be scheduled using Calendar, launchd or a tool like Power Manager.\n", "Q: Copy relative file path in Finder How can I copy a file path in Finder without the username (i.e. make it a relative file path)?\nIn our office we're working with Dropbox as our file server.

I've seen solutions for this and it doesn't seem to work for all apps (eg. Finder).\nI want to hide the dead pixels and not lose my touchpad pointer behind the notch. If there is a way to disable the top pixels (top 74 pixels), this will have the added benefit of fixing the screen resolution (8x5 instead of 756x491).\n(As to why the notch bothers me, here is a YouTube video for more context.)\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Two hours after your question, Apple released macOS Monterey 12.1 which has a fix for some notch display issues.\nAfter upgrading to Monterey 12.1, you'll find that the menu bar items (on the right hand side) won't get obscured by the notch.\nYou might want to reconsider loosing the extra screen real estate now that at least some of these issues have been fixed.\nIf you still want to do as per your question, you can actually do that using this work around:\nFor the few programs that do not yet properly support the notch and have issues with too many menu items - Apple created a \"work around feature\": Open Finder, find the app, right-click and select Get Info. In the small window that opens, enable Scale to fit below built-in camera.\nNow when you open that app, the menu bar will appear below the notch. This goes not only for that particular app, but for all the apps in the same Space (if you're not using Spaces, then it is simply for all your apps).\nSo you could simply consider enabling that work-around for a program you always have open (for example a browser) - and your menubar will be located as you requested.\n\nA: I was able to disable the notch by changing the screen resolution (as suggested by nicolas2008). I found a swift script that lists available resolutions and allows to select one.

When trying to send a photo from the iPhone to the MBA, the MBA appears on the iPhone as an AirDrop destination (i.e., the MBA is \"seen\" or \"discovered\"). When selected, the MBA icon shows \"Waiting,\" but the transmission doesn't occur.\nIn the opposite direction (MBA > iPhone) AirDrop works correctly. Both the MBA and iPhone connect and operate correctly, and both are connected to the same wifi network. Bluetooth is enabled on both, and on the MBA sudo pkill blued has been run in the Terminal, and /Library/Preferences/com.Apple.Bluetooth.plist has been trashed (and automatically recreated).\nUntil last week, AirDrop worked bidirectionally, as it has on these two devices for years. I cannot identify a specific update (on either the MBA or the iPhone) after which AirDrop failed.\nI've restarted both machines, force-restated the iPhone, and signed out of iCloud and then in again on both. No change is noted.\nWhat else might I try?\n\nA: I was able to solve this problem by turning OFF the Firewall in the MBA.\nTogether with the VPN that may be stopping Airdrop, also the Mac Firewall turned ON can be the reason for this problem.\nBy turning it OFF for a moment it is possible to make Airdrop work (at least in my case). This can be configured in System Preference > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Turn Off Firewall.\nAlternatively, instead of turning Firewall OFF you can just allow incoming connection for the sharingd service.\n", "Q: Converting from .jpg to .pdf yields blank pages I have some problems converting 180 JPG files into a single PDF.

Can devices draw any power from the 3.5 mm audio port on MacBook Pros?\n\nA: The answer to this depends on why you're asking the question:\nIs the audio port intended to be used for drawing power? - No.\nCan a device theoretically draw power from the audio port? - Yes.\nCan a device draw enough power to for example charge a phone? - No.\nI.e. in most practical circumstances and \"wishful thinking\" about the audio port - the answer is no. However, if you're doing a hobby project, control the audio output and think it would be fun to power a single LED or similar - that's within reach.\n", "Q: How much power can be drawn from the MacBook Pro's 3.5 mm port? How much power can be drawn from the MacBook Pro's 3.5 mm audio port?\nIs it possible for a device to draw power from it while playing aloud any audio the MacBook may be outputting through it?\n\nA: The exact amount of power depends on the model of MacBook Pro.\nYou can usually expect to be able to draw something in the small milliwatt range at best - i.e. something like 10-20 mW for a smart phone audio output, and a laptop perhaps 50-100 mW.\nIf you happen to have a new MacBook Pro, it is possible to draw a lot more power as it is specially equipped for providing power:\n\nWhen you connect headphones with an impedance of less than 150 ohms, the headphone jack provides up to 1.25 volts RMS. For headphones with an impedance of 150 to 1k ohms, the headphone jack delivers 3 volts RMS\n\nAnd yes, it is theoretically possible to play aloud the audio while drawing the power - but it is not practical. The audio signal basically is the power, so for practical purposes you would try to maximize power output by effectively playing non-music (i.e. basically loud \"noise\").\n\nA: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212856 (thanks to @jksoegaard for the reference in their answer!), the adaptive-impedance audio interface circuit on the new MBP operates in two modes:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWhen you connect headphones with an impedance of less than 150 ohms, the headphone jack provides up to 1.25 volts RMS.\n\n\n\n*\n\nFor headphones with an impedance of 150 to 1k ohms, the headphone jack delivers 3 volts RMS.\n\nFrom the basic physics of resistive circuits:\nP = V^2 / R\n\nThis means that we can infer the following:\n\n*\n\n*In low-impedance mode, the best-case voltage is 1.25 Vrms. Presuming a flat power curve (i.e., the voltage drops accordingly to maintain constant power through a reduced resistance), this means that at 150 Ω the power delivered into the load is P = V^2 / R = (1.25 Vrms)^2 / 150 Ω = 10.4 mWrms. If the power curve is not flat then the available power may be higher or lower for lower-impedance loads.\n\n*In high-impedance mode, the voltage is fixed at 3 Vrms. Maximum power develops through minimum resistance, so at the lower end of the 150-1kΩ impedance range we have P = (3 Vrms)^2 / 150 Ω = 60 mWrms.\n\nIn both cases these are optimal parameters derived from a combination of electrical characterizations on Apple's part and a simplified theoretical model on our part. Real-world conditions are not as optimal and will likely see a slight reduction to these maximums.\n", "Q: Can I swap the command and control only in iterm2 with karabiner?

Do you have to buy Apple hardware to develop macOS software? I tried to find a way to run a macOS VM or cross-compile to macOS, but hit dead ends.  They all seem to involve development environments that only run on macOS.\nHopefully I just have terrible investigative skills.\n\nA: You are not allowed to run macOS without a mac and so building native apps.\nHowever you could rent macs and access them with services like Macminicolo, Amazon EC2 Mac instances  and others. With them you can run Xcode and build your apps on the cloud.\n\nA: Yes as an individual, you need Apple hardware to develop iOS and macOS software. Even if you developed your app using something other than a Mac, you will need a Mac to compile the final product that is uploaded to the App Store. Xcode is the primary tool for macOS and iOS development and it is only available on the Mac.\nHowever, there are some workarounds using Electron which would let you build desktop apps for all platforms including macOS.

What I mean by Windows is the latest version of Windows 10 available, which can be downloaded as an ISO file from this Microsoft website. To keep using Windows 10 after installing, you will need to a license, which may require a purchase. You may still be able to license by using the product key from a previous version of Windows.\nThe newest version of macOS that Apple states is compatible with your Mac is Catalina. However, this requires using APFS, which will probably have poor performance when installed to the internal HDD. High Sierra is the last version of macOS that does not require APFS, so you should probably at least upgrade to this version. The instructions for downloading the upgrade software application is given here. If you have problems getting High Sierra, then try for Sierra.\nIf after upgrading to a newer version of macOS, the Boot Camp Assistant will not allow the installation of Windows 10, then you should still be able to make the Windows 10 installation flash drive. Post a comment and I will update this answer to include instructions to finish the installation of Windows 10 without further use of the Boot Camp Assistant.\n", "Q: Updated MacPorts curl implementation behaves differently from previous version and macOS curl I am having an issue with the mac ports implementation of curl.\nmbp2016:~ pgee$ which curl\n/opt/local/bin/curl\n\nmbp2016:~ pgee$ curl --version\ncurl 7.80.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin21.1.0) libcurl/7.80.0 OpenSSL/3.0.0 zlib/1.2.11 zstd/1.5.0 libidn2/2.3.2 libpsl/0.21.1 (+libidn2/2.3.2)\nRelease-Date: 2021-11-10\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB PSL SSL TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\n\nmbp2016:~ pgee$ curl --head https://www.ahpra.gov.au\ncurl: (35) error:0A000152:SSL routines::unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled\n\nmbp2016:~ pgee$ /usr/bin/curl --version\ncurl 7.77.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin21.0) libcurl/7.77.0 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/2.8.3 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.42.0\nRelease-Date: 2021-05-26\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM NTLM_WB SPNEGO SSL UnixSockets\n\nmbp2016:~ pgee$ /usr/bin/curl --head https://www.ahpra.gov.au\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\nPragma: no-cache\nContent-Length: 160133\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nExpires: -1\nSet-Cookie: AhpraWeb=1piaikc5vpec3wnhon03ab1b; path=/; secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nP3P: CP=\"CAO CURa ADMa PSAa PSDa IVAa IVDa HISa OTPa DELa STP COM NAV INT STA\"\nDate: Sun, 12 Dec 2021 09:47:21 GMT\nSet-Cookie: TS018b815b=0159a15e4f400ce883fd78f837a346d5a62bb71ed32f3cd47fb00b7b3e1515b7af8c96c9498324e287a318da5bbaac588926bd3ce4134eced00319de6fd856439860ec84e7; Path=/\n\nSo - this shows that the mac-ports installed version (7.80.0) isn't able to connect to a specific server (it can connect with other servers). But the system installed version of curl (7.77.0) does connect to that server.\nI did try to force-rebuild curl with :sudo port upgrade -s -n --force curl but that had no effect.\nThis error causes an issue for my development copy of apache/php and in particular the guzzle library. This was working before the update - any ideas how to fix?\n\nA: As your MacPorts curl --version command shows, it uses OpenSSL 3.0.0 to connect to secure http sites, while the macOS /usr/bin/curl uses LibreSSL 2.8.3 for the same.\nThe error you are getting for not being able to connect to ahpra.gov.au is due to them using an SSL server without Renegotiation Indication Extension, which makes the secure connection vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. OpenSSL seems to have chosen to be extra cautious here, and thus refuses to establishes a potentially unsafe secure connection. (The link provided by Gordon Davisson discusses this on Github - unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled #16278).\nSo if you still want to use MacPorts curl, you will have to use it without OpenSSL. Fortunately, Macports does offer different variants of curl that do not use OpenSSL. Macports curl is also available with:\n\n*\n\n*darwinssl - Allow secure connections using Apple OS native TLS.\n\n*gnutls - Allow secure connections using GNU TLS.\n\n*wolfssl - Allow secure connections using wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL).\n\nYou can thus opt for one of these variants. The MacPorts command to install a different variant of an app is\n\nsudo port install name-of-app +variant\n\nSo in your case, if you want to use the macOS built-in library instead of OpenSSL, you should uninstall the current MacPorts curl (sudo port uninstall curl) and install the darwinssl curl variant (sudo port install curl +darwinssl).\n", "Q: What should I do when main display shows slim horizontal lines on a Macbook pro 2017 touchbar model?

The documents had been backed up to Dropbox, but the music folder was not. I have my previous MacBook (running High Sierra) that contained my music current to mid-2020, whose stuff I have copied over with Migration Assistant, so I do have that at a minimum - but I'd like to get things back the way they were before the spill last month.\nI'm not worried about having to re-download the music itself. What I'm worried about is my precious metadata, which are the reason I still use Apple's music app instead of Spotify. Since the mid-'00s I have maintained a carefully curated random-play playlist: it uses nested smart playlists to pick songs based on their star ratings and how recently they were last played. This is by far my preferred way to listen to music and I want to keep it. My hope is to keep all the star ratings and last-played from pre-spill times (Nov 2021) so I can get my music back to the way it was.\nI have three places that this data can be drawn from:\n\n*\n\n*Before the SSD died I was able to copy the \"Music Library.musiclibrary\" file from the old computer. I was NOT able to copy all the music, but I did get that file.\n\n*My iPhone has most, possibly all, of my music on it from before the spill.\n\n*And everything up to mid-2020 is still there copied over from the older computer's iTunes.\n\nThe simple thing would be just to import the 2020-era iTunes library to the Music app on the new computer, but if I left it at that I'd lose over a year's worth of star ratings and last-played data (plus the playlists I created during that year). Since I have the old Music Library file and the iPhone, I'm hopeful that I can get the ratings and last-played back using those. I'm just not sure exactly how to go about it. Given the parameters of the situation above, can you please advise on the most effective way for me to get my music setup back to pre-spill status, including playlists and metadata?\nNote: I don't have an Apple Music subscription. My iPhone used to sync with the old computer, the one that died.\n\nA: I had the same problem, in that I had a complete copy of my audio collection on my iPhone (X) but a fresh macOS installation with only old Music Library backup.\nI had to use a third party tool. I couldn't get this to work with Music.app (previously iTunes.app), applescript, or any other free tool.\nI ended up with iMazing.app (https://imazing.com/iphone-music-transfer) which did transfer over what was important for me: rating, play count, and for audiobooks the meta data where to resume playing and in what chapter.\nI got a 30% discount using University email address, and I have continued to use this tool, primarily now to backup my Call history and Messages history with images and other attachments. I am not affiliated with iMazing other as a user. There are a myriad tools to \"backup iPhones\" but it's a shady market when it comes to free tools. After some back on forth on reddit I concluded iMazing would deliver and it did. In the end I had some new music that wasn't synced over to the iPhone that I had to manually sync over later, but thats my fault and no single piece of software could fix that. Good luck!\n", "Q: Importing photos from Windows PC to Photos I need to transfer all my picture collection, which is stored on a Windows PC, to a brand new Mac (Monterey)\nOn my PC, pictures are stored in folders, and correctly EXIF tagged (DateTimeOriginal), therefore, what I would like to achieve is to import pictures in Photos so that:\n\n*\n\n*Albums are automatically created from the folder name\n\n*Albums are sorted automatically by picture EXIF dates, within an album\n\n*Pictures are automatically sorted by EXIF date (not by filesystem date or import date)\n\nWhile point 1 can be apparently achieved using this script, how can I match point 2 & 3?\n\nA: To import photos from multiple/nested folders, open the Mac Photos app > in the top menu, click File > Import. Navigate to where your folders are, and select the top level folder which houses your complete folder hierarchy. Click \"Review for Import\", then check mark the \"Keep Folder Organization\" box. This will create an album for each folder. For nested folders, it will preserve the folders / albums hierarchy. Metadata will be preserved, so photos will appear in chronological order based on EXIF dates.\n", "Q: Using M1 iPad Pro (2020) to charge other USB-C devices Is it possible to charge use an M1 iPad Pro (2020) as USB-C battery pack in a pinch? For example, would it be possible to plug in a MacBook (or any device that accepts USB-C charging) and have the iPad charge the other device?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209186#:~:text=Use%20your%20iPad%20to%20charge%20other%20devices seems to suggest this only works for a subset of devices e.g. USB-C->Lightning, or iPad to iPad.\nSome additional Google suggests that USB OTG (On The Go) support is required, and Google suggests that the M1 iPad Pro (2020) does not support this.\n\nA: No - the iPad does not provide charging power, just accessory level power.\nI like Anker PD devices, but you have a ton of options in that space without needing a computer attached to the battery. The Anker 9 series offer more current / faster charge for double the price of the previous unit.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to use an iPad Pro to charge other USB-C devices.  The USB-C port on iPad Pro tablets can provide up to 7.5 watts.  I recalled reading this somewhere, it just took a minute to find a source to prove I wasn't making this up: https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/07/ipad-pro-usb-c-accessories/\nPlugging a USB-C to USB-C cable from an iPad Pro tablet to another device can mean the power could flow in a direction opposite to what you want.  USB-C allows power flow in either direction and which way it flows can be random.  If power is not flowing the direction you want then usually disconnecting and reconnecting will reverse the flow.  That doesn't always work though because it depends on the other device too.\nA way to know the power flows the direction you want is to put a USB-C to USB-A (female) adapter on the iPad then plug a USB-C to USB-A (male) cable into that and the cable into the device you want to charge.  USB-A ports only allow power to flow out and use of an adapter will force the direction of power flow.  You can also flip this around to charge your iPad Pro from a phone or whatever.  Because there is USB-A in the middle the maximum power flow will be limited by that USB-A connector, which is 5 volts at 2.4 amps, or 12 watts.\n7.5 watts is the maximum power from an iPad Pro USB-C port, whatever device you connect might not draw the maximum power for many different reasons. Again, if you use a USB-C to USB-A adapter and a USB-A to USB-C cable to connect a USB-C device to something else for power the power flow will be limited to 12 watts or less because of the USB-A port in the middle, no matter how much power the source is rated to supply.  If you want 20 watts into your iPad Pro from a 20 watt USB-C power brick then you need to use a proper USB-C to USB-C cable.\nCould you run your MacBook from your iPad Pro?  That depends a lot on the model of MacBook.  One clue will be what size of power adapter came with your MacBook.  The power adpater included with the MacBook will give an idea on how much power the laptop consumes, and how big the battery is compared to the iPad Pro.  A MacBook that came with a 29 watt power adapter is going to take less power than a MacBook that came with a 140 watt power adapter.\nI'm keeping in mind the provision \"in a pinch\".  This is something you might not want to do regularly as this will introduce additional wear on the iPad Pro battery.  Consider the size of the battery in the iPad Pro versus the device you are trying to charge.  A Macbook will have a larger battery (perhaps MUCH larger battery) and so you might not get a useful amount of energy from the iPad Pro.  Compared to an iPhone though the iPad Pro will have much more energy and so could extend the iPhone use considerably.\n", "Q: Why is macOS Monterey (12.0.1) showing me 3 different command line tools updates, infinitely? \nMy new MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon) is showing me 3 updates available for Command Line Tools.

I've noticed that when I close my laptop screen while it is connected to an external monitor, battery lasts quite longer before I need to plug in my Lenovo laptop.\nIs it just me or does closing the lid actually reduce battery consumption, since my laptop does not need to power the pixels on the screen? The monitor is plugged to the wall.\nI think we refer to this as \"calmshell mode\"?\n\nA: Since your laptop display is off in clamshell mode, there would be some energy savings, making the battery last longer.\n", "Q: AirPods Max not charging from a 5W charger I have a 5W charger that I bought from Apple, it works fine with my phone. Now I got AirPods Max, they were delivered with an empty battery, so I started charging them. The headphones immediately woke with 1% of charge and I was able to use them while they were connected. Then I left them for a couple of hours and was surprised to see that they're still at 1%. But the battery is charging with a random 13W charger (wire is the same).\nAny ideas why that might be the case? I contacted Apple support and the agent was pretty much saying that \"chargers might work differently with different devices\" and suggested to go to the store and talk to people there when I started pushing the matter.\n\nA: Ok so I have had 2 pairs of AirPods Max that had a short circuit in the logic board and I luckily got them replaced by warranty, both were charged with a 5W power adapter from Apple. Now this is my third pair and I have only been charging it with a brand new 20W power adapter from Apple and the cable included in the box and so far everything is working normally. Apparently, AirPods Max are very sensitive to charging with a power adapter that was not intended. AKA anything but that 20W adapter.\n", "Q: How to exclude errored cell in SUM or Average formulas?

I've tried several ways to use LS_COLORS (the standard method for such things) without success. Is it possible to bypass LSCOLORS and use LS_COLORS directly? (zsh shell, Catalina)\n\nA: Neither of those variables has any special meaning to zsh. They are solely used by ls, which is not an internal program to zsh. However, you have two ls at your disposal on macos:\nThe ls which comes with the OS, is the BSD variant, and as you can see from the man page, it reacts on LSCOLORS, provided that coloring is enabled (CLICOLOR=\"Yes\").\nThen you can install the Gnu Tools on your Mac, which brings you GNU ls (depending on how you installed them, invoked via ls or via gls), and this ls obeys the variable LS_COLORS.\nHence, it all depends on which ls you are using...\n", "Q: macOS Monterey \"Save As\" file naming bug - is there a fix? I've noticed when assigning file names during a \"Save As\" in Monterey, the text I type gets put in the wrong place.

Apple has not held stock of these beyond 2016; and they would have been manufactured some years before that.\nEven if never used, batteries have a limited life, and there's nothing you can do to 'revive' it, without risking fire.\nApple rarely sells parts to the public, and there is a large counterfeit market, so the genuine-ness of the product remains questionable, even if it's got \"Apple\" written on it.\n", "Q: AppleScript find items in list I didn't use AppleScript for a while now and I can't seem to code a script I need\nWhat I'm trying to do:\nlist1: working day {\"Monday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"}\nitem to find currentDay : set currentDay to weekday of (get current date) as text\n(basically I want to check if I'm working today or not in order to run a another script)\nset currentDay to weekday of (get current date) as text\nset workingdays to {\"Monday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"}\nset imworking to false\n\nrepeat with a from 1 to length of workingdays\n    set theCurrentListItem to item a of workingdays\n    if theCurrentListItem = workingdays then\n        set imworking to true\n    else\n        set imworking to false\n    end if\nend repeat\n\ntheCurrentListItem and currentDay = \"Monday\"\nso why if theCurrentListItem = workingdays is not true\n\nA: \n(basically I want to check if I'm working today or not in order to run a another script)\n\nHere is a different way of coding it that works:\nExample AppleScript code:\nset currentDay to weekday of (current date) as text\nset workingDays to {\"Monday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"}\nset imWorking to false\n\nrepeat with thisDay in workingDays\n    if contents of thisDay = currentDay then\n        set imWorking to true\n        exit repeat\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nif imWorking then\n    --  # Do other stuff here.\nend if\n\n", "Q: Keep iPhone display on while connected to mac Is there a native setting or a shortcut, that I can use to keep my iPhone display always on until I lock it, while it is connected to my macbook?\nThis would be really helpful while developing apps for iPhone.\nI don't want to turn on the screen all the time, only while connected to this macbook or if it is not possible, than while charging.\n\nA: You can create a personal automation that start when the phone is connected to power. Unfortunately AFAIK there is no way to change the auto-lock timer from shortcuts, the only thing you can do is open settings when you connect to power so that it's slightly faster to change the setting.\nOther than that the only thing you can do is send a feedback to apple to get access to more settings using shortcuts.\nThe only \"hack\" I can think of is to start playing a black, silent video with PiP, but that seems like a lot of work for a very bad and annoying solution, since if you're doing dev work you probably don't want a black square in your screen.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13'' (early 2011) battery not charging/suddenly shutting down I have a Macbook Pro 13\" early 2011 which stopped charging a couple of months ago. I'll describe its current issues:\n1) Not charging battery\n2) If turned on it can either not start (right white light flashes fast) or start for a couple of minutes and then shut down.\nI could start it with this method:\n\n- remove power cord\n- Pressing power for 10 seconds\n- plug power cord, wait 10 seconds\n- release power.\n\n\nWhen I perform these steps, fan runs at maximum power (6000+ rpm) and the green light in the power cord is off. Also, mac fans control application didn't detect the fans.\nI tried to reset the SMC with shift+option+ctrl+power before starting it.\nIs there something I can do or some step i'm doing wrong?\nNOTE: I'm currently living in a country without apple support\nthanks!\n\nA: What is the cycle count? You will find this is System Information, under \"Power\". (You can bring up the System Information app by holding Alt/Opt and clicking on the Apple menu, where it will be the first item.)\nYou will be lucky for a battery (of that era) to last between 3 and 5 years. Assuming you've not had it replaced before, and it's 10 years old, then it's just a completely dead battery.\nIf there are no Apple Authorised Repair centers where you are, then you can try to do it yourself, if you can find a replacement part.

I recently cloned my internal drive to a 1TB external SSD using SuperDuper!. It worked great, allowing me to boot into it, do everything I need to.\nHowever, today, I went to Startup Security Utility in attempts to change the policy to Reduced Security to allow kernel extensions. However, it get “Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator account was found.”\nI’ve looked around a bit, and found some post on this forum, but none directly relate— most are about not being able to boot into an external drive.

I bought them specifically for work-related meetings and calls because they have a very good microphone, which can filter most of the noises.\nWhen I talk in Slack or Zoom on my mac it often mutes me without any actions on my side. It mutes me as if I pressed the mute button on the headphones and I have to press it again to unmute. The button is small and it is hard to press it and it annoys the hell out of me when I'm cut off in the middle of the sentence at a work call.\nI used Zoom and Slack on Windows and I didn't have such issues there.\nWho has experienced this problem? Do you know how to fix it so it won't mute me every few minutes?\nI have a MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020 with macOS Monterey 12.0.1 (21A559) with an Apple M1 chip.\n\nA: Perhaps this can also help?\nFrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253371535\n\nI've been having this problem too (Trekz Air and Aeropex) and I've figured out my problem.  Looks like if you reduce the mic input level setting to zero then the Mac tells the headphones to mute.  I had my Zoom audio settings set to \"Automatically adjust microphone volume\" which causes it to reduce the mic input level to zero whenever it thinks you are not speaking, which triggers the headphone mute.  I have disabled this option and now I don't get the constant muting.  There is a similar setting in Microsoft Teams (Devices --> Automatically adjust mic sensitivity) which you also need to disable.\n\n\nA: If you're using Google Meet (or some other web-based conferencing platform) in Chrome (or any Chromium browser) the Disable Automatic Gain Control extension is a lifesaver. Chrome has a built-in gain control similar to the one in macOS but it operates independently and has no ability to be disabled via the browser settings. This extension clobbers it for you and will allow you to use Meet as expected.\n", "Q: Show copy/move Finder dialogue window This is something I'm very confused about (a little embarrassed too since being a mac user for a long time), but I can't find the progress window for copying or moving in Finder.\nIt was there and I think I accidentally COMMAND + W on it and it disappeared. But now I have no way of knowing how far into a copy I am without watching the pie icon in the list view.\nI've tried rebooting, or relaunching Finder hoping it would fix it. I've also tried Show all Windows but nothing minimised. I have disconnected external displays, and made sure its not hidden behind another app.\nIs this a macOS bug or am I just not reading the menu correctly?\n\nUpdate:\nThe accepted answer helps fix the dialogue window reappearing, but after reading the command saw there is an option for it under Window - I was searching for Copy/Move but it's titled Progress\n\n\nA: Try this:\ndefaults delete com.apple.finder CopyProgressWindowLocation && osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit' && open ~\n\n\nA: Normally, 'Copy' is listed as a Window in the Window menu, so you should be able to select it from there. You should also see it in 'Application Windows', which is usually F3. If it's not there, then something weird is definitely going on.\nAlso, you can't close a Finder window with Command Q, and even if that did do something, I wouldn't expect it to have permanent consequences.\nI'd go a bit further than pion's suggestion, and remove the whole com.apple.finder.plist in the user's Library Preferences folder. Then restart the Finder and see if that improves things.\n", "Q: trying to ssh from 2018 macbook to mac mini; getting error \"pledge: filesystem full\" and \"shell request failed on channel 0\" Been having a fun day. I upgraded both my mac mini (intel, 2018) and my macbook (intel, 2018) to Monterey and also upgraded openssl and whatever else brew was willing to upgrade. I used to be able to ssh from my macbook to the mac mini with an ssh key I had copied over. Now the spooky stuff:\n\n*\n\n*my password to authenticate to the mac mini is different from my user's password on the mac mini\n\n*this error message, when I try ssh -Tv username@mac.mini.net:\n\nAuthenticated to mac.mini.net ([ipaddress]:22) using \"password\".\ndebug1: channel 0: new [client-session]\ndebug1: Entering interactive session.\ndebug1: pledge: filesystem full\nshell request failed on channel 0\n\n\n*\n\n*I also get exec failed on channel 0 when I try to copy over an ssh key.\n\nI don't know if I should nuke the whole setup (I need the ssh keys I have to log into other stuff though - I can ssh into other machines without any trouble) - tutorials on safely nuking my ssh setup are welcome if y'all think that is the case. Any advice on what's going on / what to try next would be very helpful.\n\nA: What version of ssh are you using on the client and the server? You can find out using ssh -V.\nAlso, for your next step, try ssh -vvv to show all 3 levels of debug mode. It might indicate why it is failing.\nBTW, the debug1: pledge: filesystem full message actually has to do with the HostKeys in the UserKnownHostsFile.

Drafts is marketed as a Markdown editor, and supposedly it saves your files in iCloud.  However, if you open the \"Drafts\" folder inside iCloud Drive there is not a Markdown file in sight.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest value of using Markdown is to avoid vendor lock-in, and to never risk being held captive by a single app, especially one with a subscription model.  (Not to mention the ability to open the files with different apps that have different strengths, more or less a corollary of the first thing.  I should be free to use TextMate or Visual Studio Code or nvim if something I want to do with the file is better done there.)  Drafts seems like a very useful app, but what in the world is going on with my Markdown files?\n\nA: Drafts stores the notes in CloudKit, not directly in files. From https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/sync\n\nDrafts syncs using CloudKit, the same iCloud technology that lies beneath iCloud Drive, Notes, and other Apple services. It does not sync via files. Drafts can export and import to files in iCloud Drive, but content in Drafts is not directly visible in iCloud Drive.\n\nThere is an \"Export\" command in the \"File\" menu which allows you to export to text files.\nIf you have Backups enabled in Preferences, the Markdown data is also available in the DraftsBackup file shown in your screenshot (which basically is a JSON file containing both the actual text and all metadata). If required, the pure Markdown part can be extracted with any JSON-capable tool (e.g. jq).\n", "Q: iPhone 12 camera inserts unknown icon in photo of crossword puzzle I photograph solved crossword puzzles at nyxcrossword.com. I use the photo as answers to the same blank puzzle I am trying to solve. I use an iPhone 12 recently upgraded to iOS 15.1.1\nSince the upgrade I am getting an icon in the lower right corner. I did a reverse image search of the icon at images.google.com and tineye.com and both said \"zero matches\".\nDoes anyone recognize the icon and know how to get rid of it?\n\n\nA: As the other answer mentioned, the icon is for Live Text. You can't turn it for just one picture (or even just one app) but there is a system-wide setting that disables it completely.\nOpen the Settings app and tap General, then Language & Region, then find the switch for Live Text and turn it off.\n\nGo back to your photo and the icon should be gone.\n\nA: The icon offers an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature to extract the actual text from the image as individual characters you can copy/paste etc.  Apple calls this feature \"Live Text\" and it was introduced with iOS 15 for supported devices.\nThe icon appears on the phone when you have it directed at something which the feature recognizes as text. Just ignore it and take the picture if you don't want to use it.\nIf you do want to use it, clicking on the icon in the camera app brings up a familiar \"Copy\" / \"Select All\" / \"Look Up\" clipboard management toolbar. You can interactively swipe some regions of the image to select the text in them for copying or other manipulation.\n\nIn the photo album viewer, the icon gets superimposed over images which contain text so that you can extract it \"non-live\" after the fact. The icon is still not actually part of the picture, as you can easily verify by zooming etc.\n(I literally discovered this by directing my phone camera at the picture you posted. I wasn't aware of this feature until now.)\n", "Q: Why `read -N` doesn't work in this script on mac terminal? could anyone please advise me how to fix this for a terminal in macos?\nThank you for your help.\n read -s -N1 -p \"Press a key: \"\n K1=\"$REPLY\"\n read -s -N2 -t 0.001\n K2=\"$REPLY\"\n read -s -N1 -t 0.001\n K3=\"$REPLY\"\n key=\"$K1$K2$K3\"\n\nError:  read: -N: invalid option\nFull script enter link description here\n\nA: /bin/bash is version 3.2.57 (or similar) which doesn't support -N.

This isn't a purely Apple scenario, but since all my devices are Apple products, I'll have a chance at understanding/using any tech-toned answers.\nQuestion: I've been doing due-diligence in choosing a password manager.  Then it occurred to me: what happens after, say, 14 months and I decide (insert reason) to quit-cancel the service?  All my passwords, from a trivial game site to my banking access are inside this manager. Does the password manager vomit up the dozens of random-generated machine passwords for me to manually copy & paste?  Do I have to go to each site and \"create new password\"?  The best situation I can conceive is laborious and miserable.  The worst is being left right out in the cold.\nThe FAQ and Support pages of 1Password, Nordpass, and all the others are very resistant to discussing the idea of someone ever quitting their marvellous service.  The only entries I've found are how to literally uninstall their software, but with no notes on what happens next.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nA: You need to investigate each password manager.\nAs an example, 1Password has this support page Export which says:\nOpen and unlock 1Password.\n\nSelect the vault you want to export. It’s not possible to export from “All Vaults”, so you’ll need to switch to a specific vault.\n\nChoose File > Export > All Items. If you belong to a team account, there may be some vaults where you don’t have the “Export items” permission. Ask your team administrator.\n\nEnter your 1Password account password.\n\nChoose a file format:\n\n - 1Password Interchange Format (.1pif) to move data to another copy of 1Password. \n - Comma Delimited Text (.csv) to move data to a different\n   app. \n - Tab Delimited Text (.txt) to move data to a different app.\n\nClick Save.\n\nWhen I try an export, it suggests a 4th file format - csv suited to iCloud Keychain.\nMost password managers will import from a .csv, but the transfer may need the file to be massaged somewhat - most likely some moving columns or adding required header line.\nSo you just need to search the support pages of each password manager to find out how easy it might be to export and import passwords.\n", "Q: Can't access Website through Wireguard, only works through SOCKS proxy My site is running on a server and is only reachable through Wireguard.

I left it overnight before re-building the next day, now all I get is fan noise when powering up, no boot up or chimes. my question is would the lack of power to the memory left over night be the cause, ie, nothing to boot from?, and would booting up from an external drive be the answer?\nI was thinking of making a bootable macos high sierra copy from my Macbook on an external hard drive and trying to boot from this.\nPRAM battery was changed in the last few days.\n\nA: The chime on a Mac (of that era) is an indication that the core hardware is working correctly. No chime means that there is some hardware problem.\nIf it was simply a question of no bootable drive, then you would get the chime, followed by a flashing question mark on the screen.\nI would re-open it and make sure that you have correctly re-seated the RAM and other components, after your strip-down.

This may require holding down the option key, if dragging and dropping the item to user B's Drop Box. User A may then elect to put the original item in the trash.\n\nNote: Having user A move an item to user B's Drop Box can result in User B having to enter a password in order to move the item to the trash. This is why copying should be used instead.\n\nFor user B to take ownership of the item, user B needs to copy the item from user B's Drop Box. This may require holding down the option key, if dragging and dropping the item from user B's Drop Box.

My mom is a photographer, and she wants the original quality photos downloaded off her iPhone to use in professional photo programs like Lightroom and Photoshop.\nShe previously used Image Capture to do this, but has recently begun using Optimize Photo Storage to also store all these photos on iCloud.\nAccording to my research, this means that sometimes photos downloaded via Image Capture will not be full size, so Image Capture is out.\nWe instead tried to download these originals via the Photos app on the Mac. However, you can only download the unmodified original photo (in Image Capture it showed the original AND the modified for download).\nThis is inconvenient of course because any edits made on the iPhone won't come through.\nWe also tried to export a JPEG from the Photos app, but both the High and Maximum quality were not the same size or quality as the modified original photos we could download on Image Capture. It seems a normal export via the Photos app does some kind of conversion on it so it is no longer original. But that also seems to be the only way to get the modifications from the Photos app\nSo...how do we download the modified original image from the Photos app?\n(Or...how would we download the modified original image from Image Capture while guaranteed that the photo is the Full Size photo and not a thumbnail or some other not full quality version?)\n\nA: Photos on Mac does let you export edited photos. Select photos, then in the top menu, click File > Export > Export N Photos'. If you export JPGs, Photos will apply some compression. For non-lossy transfers, you could set the iPhone to capture RAW format (See this). Lightroom can now also import directly from iPhone (See this).\n", "Q: MacOS >11.0: Is there a way to programmatically give an app Privacy->Accessibility Permissions? Using only a command line, is it possible to add an app to Security & Privacy/Privacy/Accessibility shown below?\nUsing Azure Pipelines, I'm attempting to set up a remote machine and it needs a specific app to have these accessibility permissions. I don't have access to the machine, I can only set things up using the command line. Is it possible to achieve this?\n\n\nA: I don't think so. Using the tccutil command only allows you to reset the permissions so the user can click and grant permission.\nHowever if the Mac is enrolled in a Mobile Device Management system, you can create a profile that has the appropriate TCC permissions set and push it out to the device.

However, every article I have seen about moving Time Machine backups refer to Backups.backupdb file/folder.  When I examine the contents of the backup there is no Backups.backupdb but just a number of Time Machine Backup files with the date and time e.g. 2021-10-14-143009.  The backups all work and I am able to select a date and reinstall from them.  So, am I able to just copy these files to a NAS or is the way Time Machine stores on a NAS different and why is there no Backups.backupdb file/folder?\n\nA: Your last question first! Why no Backups.backupdb?\nUntil the last 15 months, Time machine formatted the destination drive as HFS+ and placed each backup inside the Backups.backupdb folder. Each backup appears as a folder with all source folders and files inside it.  It uses hard links to avoid really duplicating the files in each backup.  The hard links (particularly those for folders) are the main cause of backup corruption.\nSince Big Sur, new Time Machine backups format the destination as an APFS volume.  Each backup appears as an APFS snapshot. Again all snapshots have all source folders and files. The magic of APFS avoids the duplication of files.  This is a much more robust storage and in nearly every way is better.\nCan you copy files to your NAS?\nYes, but not easily if you want to preserve all the backup history. My advice would be to copy one snapshot to a somewhere on your NAS. This will lose all your history, but will be simple to do.

I have also seen a post on Reddit where people are getting the option to customize their touchbar under system preferences > keyboard settings (Customize Control Strip) despite not having one.\nHow would I intentionally make the option to customize what options appear on the virtual touchbar (at least on XCode) under keyboard settings to show up, if not through: the command line?\nIn short; how do I get the 'Customize Control Strip' option on a macbook without a physical touchbar, but a virtual one?\n\nA: You can enable the virtual, simulated Touch Bar from Xcode's menu by choosing Window > Touch Bar > Show Touch Bar.\nFor even easier access to the Touch Bar without having to launch Xcode, you can use free utilities such as Touch Bar Simulator and Touché.\n\nA: Something interesting occurred between back then, and on macOS 12.3.\nYou simply open up XCode, and tell it to open the control strip (choose generation as well). Quit system preferences and reopen it, navigate to keyboard and it just shows customize control strip.\n", "Q: How does Google Drive locally cache files before uploading them? How safe is it when offline? I've been using Google Drive to backup via Time Machine on a macOS 10.13.6. More precisely, I've created a sparse bundle disk image, attached such image and mounted it in order to make it visible to Time Machine.\nNow, usually Time Machine finishes the backup way before Google Drive completes syncing all the files. Occasionally, however, either my computer sleeps or due to other reasons my internet disconnects. Or, maybe worse, due to power outages, my computer might eventually turn off. In those cases, what happens to whatever is being written inside the disk image?\nUsually, when the internet disconnects and reconnects again (even after several hours), Google Drive seems to indicate that the progress could be resumed. At least, I see some files similar to the ones when Time Machine output was being uploaded. However, I'm unaware on whether some of these files were corrupted or, even, whether all the written files were uploaded.\nSo, in summary, after creating a file inside the Google Drive folder, for how long and how much can Google drive stores the files locally before uploading then with and without internet connection?\nnce.\n\nA: As it was mentioned on a couple of comments to the question, saving a file to a Google Drive folder while being offline is risky because Time Machine doesn't backup the Google Drive for Desktop cache by default. The safest way to proceed while working offline is to save the file to a local folder then when going online again move the file to the Google Drive folder.\nNOTE: At this time I don't know how to make Time Machine to backup the Google Drive for Desktop cache.\n\nGoogle Drive for Desktop stores the files as long as it's necessary while it's installed on your computer, just don't keep your computer without Internet connection for a very long time (several months) as Google is continuously updating it and if  the installed version becomes too old it might not be able to communicate to the Google servers.\nNOTE: I'm returning to Mac after several years so I'm not sure about the specifics about your operative system version, but according to System requirements and browsers it's the oldest Mac version supported, so there is a risk that in the upcoming months it might become unsupported.\nAccording to a couple of answers to Can you back-up your Google Drive folder (on my Mac) with Time Machine the cached files aren't backed up by Time Machine by default.\nYou can learn about some technical stuff about Google Drive for Desktop on the help article pointed to Google Workspace administrators: Configure Google Drive for desktop\n", "Q: OSX Screenshots: Is there a way to disable the toolbar like we can disable the shadow?

I have two displays; I work on one and would like to play a game requiring some minimal interaction on the second (Loop Hero). The macOS cmd+tab can focus the window on the second display, but the cursor remains on the first display. I want to alter the cmd+tab behavior to move the cursor whenever focusing on an application on another display. Is this possible?\nFor reference, I've tried Contexts hoping that alt+tab'ing between windows instead of applications would exhibit this behavior, but it doesn't. Also, I'm on Monterey if that matters.\n\nA: Shortly after posting my question I came across AutoRaise. It supports warping the mouse to the center of a window selected with the application switcher and giving the window focus after a user-definable delay. The setting \"AutoRaise -delay 0\" will disable the focus-follows-mouse behavior and only auto-raise a window if it was switched to through the app-switcher.\n(I actually forgot that I had stumbled across AutoRaise last year on an old MacBook. I got the pings of memory after posting the question and then dusted the old MB off and found it.

I'm not sure why it's shown explicitly there; maybe it's being set by a profile, or something like that. But if it's being set by something explicitly, it's just being set to what it would be by default anyway.\nP.s. According to the page for Reposado (a tool for running your own update server),\n\nIn macOS Big Sur, Apple has removed the ability for softwareupdate\nto be pointed to a non-Apple sucatalog. This means you cannot use a\nReposado server to serve Apple software updates to Big Sur (and\npresumably later versions of macOS) clients.\n\nBut if you're seeing that in Monterey... maybe Apple brought the option back?\n\nA: I just went and manually checked for software updates, since I hadn't seen any updates in a while. I'm currently running macOS Monterey (was on 12.1). It told me my Mac was up to date after doing the check for updates.\nIt was then that I noticed this message about \"swscan.apple.com\".  I clicked the \"Details\" link and it popped up a dialog asking if I'd like to reset the update setting to the default. So I selected the option to reset to the defaults.\nAfter resetting it to the default, I closed the system settings window. Then it immediately showed the red notitifcation icon atop the system settings icon in the dock. So I opened it and -- lo and behold -- software update said there was an update for my Mac: macOS Monterey 12.2.\nSo it seems that I wasn't getting any updates until I clicked that \"Details\" link and selected to reset to the default update settings.\nThe whole thing is a bit odd as I've never changed update settings and never run any beta versions of macOS or anything like that.\n", "Q: Downtime ignoring schedule I've setup screen-time for my daughter's MacBook and want downtime to block apps between 10pm and 6am.

HomePod and HomePod Mini support streaming radio stations on demand, without an Apple Music subscription. But streaming a radio station as an alarm requires a subscription. Could I use an Apple Music Voice Plan to set up a HomePod alarm that streams a TuneIn station?\nI've checked Apple support docs and various online coverage of the Voice Plan, but didn't see a clear answer. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The answer appears to be no. After activating a trial with \"Hey Siri, start Apple Music Voice\", I tried to choose media for a HomePod Mini (15.2) alarm in the iOS Home app (15.2), and was told \"Adding audio to an alarm requires that you have an active Apple Music membership\".

What's going on here? How can I fix it?\n\nA: What's going on here?\nYou have a process running a shell. Based on information given in the posted question, the assumption is made this is a zsh, but others may be possible. When the posted script is executed, a new process is created to run the script in a /bin/sh. This new process starts three new background jobs associated with the /bin/sh. The /bin/sh then terminates, leaving the three jobs as orphan processes. So when the jobs command is entered, the three jobs do not appear, because three now orphaned processes were never jobs of the original zsh. Furthermore, when the zsh terminates, no termination type signals are sent to the three jobs because the processes are orphans.\nHow can I fix it?\nIf there is a need for the three jobs to appear when the jobs command is entered, then a . or source command can precede the scripts path and name. The script will be executed in the current zsh and therefore the first line in the posted script will be ignored. For example, if the name of the script is myscript and is in the current working directory, then either of the following could be entered.\n. ./myscript\nsource ./myscript \n\nIf need there is no need for the three jobs to appear when the jobs command is entered, then a line containing the wait command could be appended to the posted script. This will prevent the orphans from being created, when the following is used to execute the script in the background.\n./myscript &\n\nFinally, the idea of a script could be abandoned in favor of a function instead.

Where/how can I accurately find USB/external hard drive mounts in Terminal?\n\nA: Here's one way:\nlog show --debug --last 30d --predicate \"sender == 'Sandbox' AND eventMessage matches 'identified disk[0-9]+ as removable'\"\n\nNote that this can take an extremely long time to run (several minutes per day of logging, i.e., one hour or more in your case!) due to the highly inefficient search algorithm used by the log command so if you don't need 30 days of history, you can reduce the number specified in the --last XXXd argument or use the --start and/or --end arguments to specify start and end timestamp ranges, respectively.

It's not unreasonable to expect a virtual iOS environment on your M1 Mac doesn't support this either. So I think your test case\n\nthere was a need to run two instances of the application at the same time\n\nis a bit flawed.

In previous versions of macOS, I had a separate profile picture for the user account on the computer and the Apple ID iCloud account. With Monterey, it seems to have combined them such that if I change one that it automatically changes the other.\nHow can I set the profile picture for the local user account without changing the Apple ID iCloud account?\nIdeally, I would like to unlink them. Alternatively, I'm wondering if there is a way to modify a preferences file rather than going through the UI to avoid the trigger that would sync the two.\n\nA: I have found a way that seems to work. The theory is that the user interface for System Preferences is updating both the iCloud profile pic and the local user profile pic if one or the other is changed. By using the command line, I was able to change the local user profile pic without changing the iCloud pic.\nThe following steps use the change_userpic.sh script from this answer. Save the script locally and set the permissions to allow it to execute.\nThen follow these steps...\n\n*\n\n*Set the desired profile picture for the local user account through System Preferences.\n\n\n*Save the profile picture using the command line replacing 'username' with the username of the local account.\ndscl . read /Users/username JPEGPhoto | xxd -r -p > ./username.jpg\n\n\n*Set the desired iCloud profile picture through System Preferences. This will also change the local user account — which we will change in a moment.\n\n\n*Delete the local user account profile picture with the following two commands.\ndscl . delete /Users/username JPEGPhoto\ndscl . delete /Users/username Picture\n\n\n*Set the local user account profile picture to the image saved in step 2.\n./change_userpic.sh username username.jpg\nThis seems to have worked. I can see the two different profile pics in System Preferences (though not changing either one!).\n\nA: It seems like it's possible to fix this behavior by disabling Contacts sync in iCloud settings. It does mean your contacts will no longer sync (and iCloud will immediately delete the local contacts without confirmation). So far this seems to be working for me, but, as with these synchronization issues, it might just be temporary.\n\nA: Here's a solution if you have another admin account (on my machine this is associated with a different Apple ID; I'm not sure whether this is necessary).\nFirst, logged into your own account, set the picture you want to use for iCloud in System Preferences. Next, get the owner of the other admin account to log into their account. Navigate to System Preferences → Users & Groups. Unlock if necessary, then click on your user account. You can edit the picture for the local user account, and your iCloud picture will not be affected.\n", "Q: Photo returns to original position after being dragged to new position According to a web search, I should be able to drag a photo into a new position in the Photos app that is native to iPhone.\nWhen I do that, the thumbnail moves when I drag, but when I release, it simply moves back to its original position.

Send all traffic over VPN connection When setting up a new VPN in System Preferences > Network, in the Advanced page you can select a checkbox to\n\nSend all traffic over VPN connection\n\nIt is disabled by default.\nWhat traffic would not be sent over the VPN if it were left disabled?\n\nA: When you connect to a VPN, you usually only get access to a subnet (host to network). This depends on the VPN technology and configuration used, of course, but it's one of the setups you see most often.\nBy enabling this checkbox, your Mac tries to route all traffic through the VPN, even traffic that would otherwise be sent to your local gateway (host to everywhere). This is useful if you want all your browsing and other network traffic to be routed through the VPN. You may want to this for example to pretend you're at a different location or because your company has a trusted internet connection and you're sitting in a suspicious internet cafe.\n", "Q: How can I let Edge ask for being the default browser?

I used a mail app on my MacBook Pro for 6+ years that I am convinced was called Gmail. Its icon resembled that of Gmail for iOS. I had lots of mail stored in folders on my local computer. My Mac recently had to have a factory reset to resolve an issue with installing Monterey and so I lost all of my applications. I have a data backup. Now I cannot find the Gmail app or a good functional equivalent in the App store. All seem only to provide access to mail on the Gmail server, in the same way as the web interface. I cannot find one that supports local folders. Am I misremembering or has the Gmail app for Mac OSX disappeared?\n\nA: Google has never made a Gmail app for macOS.\n\nYou can use local folders in Mail.app: https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/mlhlp1021/mac.\n\nOn My Mac: Mailboxes you create in On My Mac are local, meaning you can access them only on the Mac where you created them.\n\n", "Q: How can I connect 2 dell monitors with Mac Air? I am using MacBook Air(13-inch, 2017) model. I want to connect with 2 monitors Dell (24 Monitor: E2420H)\nThe problem is the monitor doesn't have a HDMI port . It has only display port & VGA .\nWhen I searched in the internet to find the adapter , I couldn't find any adapter that can support 2 display ports\nPlease suggest the best way to connect\n\nA: That model of laptop does not support connecting two external displays.  What is an option is adding an external GPU to enable more displays.  Here's an example, not a product suggestion and I'm not sure your laptop is supported: https://www.sonnetstore.com/products/egpu-breakaway-puck-5500xt\nAgain, that's an example of the kinds of products to look for, not a suggestion to buy.  I include that example as it gives some idea on what is available and how much they will cost.\nIn case of a dead link I'll describe the product as a Thunderbolt device containing a popular GPU, the same kind of GPU one would find on popular PCIe video cards, and on the device will be two or three video output ports.  Such boxes vary widely in price based on their capability, expect to pay at least $500 on the low end and there doesn't seem to be a ceiling on the price.  As these devices are using popular GPUs, just in a different form factor, they are widely supported by software published today.  Just double check that your laptop and the Thunderbolt GPU are compatible.\nAn option that often comes in at lower cost, but with lesser performance, are external GPUs that use USB instead of Thunderbolt.  They both use USB-C cables to connect but Thunderbolt GPUs are inherently more powerful than USB GPUs, and this is for reasons that get complicated quickly so I'll not go down that rabbit hole here.  These will run on the $200 and up price range.  Because they use USB GPUs and not Thunderbolt/PCIe GPUs they are not as well supported by software.  That's not saying they won't work, it's that they might not work as well.  The screen might not update as quickly, or you might not get as high of resolution on the screen.  As above double check for compatibility before purchase.\nOne thing to keep in mind, given the price of these external GPUs and the age of your current computer it may be more cost effective to simply buy a new laptop.  A new MacBook Pro would cost as much as some of these eGPUs, so perhaps a new laptop is in your future.\n", "Q: How do I display the Bluetooth headphone icon on an iPhone Xs?

How can I sort all files and directories on my harddrive in order of most recent access?\nAccess by myself or by a program.\nI would like to see the old stuff I have lying around that just doesn't get used.\n\nA: Open a new finder window with CMD+n.  If it doesn't default to \"Recents\" - choose it.  Hit the cog, and choose \"Show Search Criteria\".\n\nThis takes you to a \"Raw query\" (other views will also do the same - I just use this as it's not grouped), choose to view by \"list\";\n\nThis enables the column headings, which you can now use to affect the sorting order.  Just click on \"Date Last Opened\" until it sorts by oldest first;\n\nAnd ... that's it!  Obviously, it won't care about files you've never opened but that's fine.

It's normal for my terminal to have 10,000+ lines of text.  I am worried I will accidentally print my terminal, and I wonder if there's a way to prevent that from happening.\nI think this is pretty likely to happen without some kind of additional safeguards.  In vscode, cmd+p is how you open the prompt.  So I frequently hit cmd+p, type some text, and then hit enter.  I'm worried I'll accidentally do this in terminal (which would start printing 10k lines of text while I run over and unplug the printer!). I've already opened the print dialog box a few times but luckily have not hit enter.\nI think ways to fix this would be 1) an additional step to open the print dialog or 2) a warning if I try to print something huge.\nUnfortunately I cannot remove the printer as this is a work machine and I cannot control the printers.\n\nA: Add a custom shortcut for the print... menu in Terminal.app. This will overwrite the default shortcut (command-p).\n\n", "Q: Can I have more than 2 outs on a Multi-Output Device I'm using a loopback audio device called BlackHole 16ch which has 16 ins and 16 outs and I have a USB Audio Interface with 2 ins and 4 outs.

Okay, so like, I'm aware the Character Viewer (⌘ + ⌃ + space) is displaying a system index of the full supported Unicode set of chars.\nZ\nMy question is, is there a way I can take a glyph I've created in, say, photoshop or illustrator and either supplant/replace one of the system glyphs, or somehow bootstrap it into one of the Private Use Area (E000) blocks inside the unicode table? I totally understand this would be a local only modification and that nobody else would see it, as they would lack the custom glyph. That's fine. I'm even fine if the value of the glyph doesn't align with the visual output (so if I were to overwrite the letter \"e\" with billiard ball - this is a \"'as a for instance,\" NOT my plan, lol - it would still sort between \"d\" and \"f\" still - this is not a requirement, just saying I wouldn't care).\nThis is for personal use on my own system.\nPresuppose I have the relevant software to create and save the glyph in any format required, raster or vector, including the ability to make it into any flavor of font or graphic file. The objective here is to be able to add custom glyphs as labels to icons, or the system-ui for my own use. Nobody else who's not on my MBP need ever see it; I just wanna know if I can override or modify that table.\n...I mean, it's gotta be stored SOMEWHERE on the drive, right?\nEdit:\nOkay, so, to further clarify: MacOS has a set of glyphs available to it by default, all built-in like, that it applies when rendering text. I favor using these when screen real estate is at a premium Example:\n\n(above: Important, Work-Related, Shopping, Movies, Music). The full set of supported chars is viewable in the Character Viewer...\n\nBut there are still hundreds of open \"slots\" that have either never been filled, or are foreign language characters Apple didn't see fit to bother with.. When you see a blank white rectangle ('▯') this is an unsupported glyph*.\nSo what I'm HOPING is someone knows how to actually not only make use of some of the open regions therein, but that also might know how to make the OS acknowledge their addition.\n\n*Apple calls them \"tofu\" and has gone pretty far outta the way to preclude their ever showing on screen. Fun fact: the OS-Shipped Noto Sans (\"Noto\" == \"NoTo\" == \"No Tofu\") font contains the MAJORITY of available glyphs\n\nA: Too long for a comment but not yet sufficient for an answer\nI'm not sure why out of the thousands of existing unicode glyphs you can't find one that will suffice.\nA glyph is called from a font. If the current font does not have the glyph, the OS provides a substitute from another font that does. [I don't know how that mechanism works, but I used to work support on a cross-platform game where subs would work in Windows but not in Mac, even though the Mac could use the glyphs in any other app.]\nSo, you need to make a font, even if it contains only one glyph, in an address space not currently in use[1], then register it to the OS…. then provide some mechanism to be able to type it, eg from Keyboard prefs > Text.\n[1]  you can't replace 'e', or any already-used character or you'll only persuade it to show if you manually change the font for that one character - which you cannot do for a file name.\nYou can use some existing glyphs in file names, which should show on any Mac [Windows I couldn't say]\nWhere they file will be dependent perhaps on their Unicode numbering. I'm not sure how to test this thoroughly.\nEnlarged example using a few fairly random glyps…\n\n\nA: You mention \"custom glyphs as labels to icons.\"  Not sure I understand what you mean by that, but if you are trying to modify the icon of a file or directory in Finder, here's how:\n\n*\n\n*Create the image you want the item to have.\n\n*Select and copy the entire image to clipboard\n\n*Select the item to be changed.\n\n*Get Info (Cmd-I)\n\n*Click on the icon upper left of info window to select it.\n\n*Paste to replace.\n\n", "Q: How can I sleep computer AND lock screen with a shortcut, but not after screensaver starts? Running Mojave (10.14.6), I want to be able to issue a single keyboard shortcut that will immediately put the computer to sleep such that (a) displays are off immediately and (b) a password will be required, even after less than a minute.\nHowever, I also want a password to not be required immediately if the screensaver is activated by the computer sitting idle.  (Call this requirement #2.)\nWhat I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Setting \"start screensaver after\" to 5 minutes and \"require password ___ after sleep or screensaver begins\" to 5 minutes as well.  This solves requirement 2 but not requirement 1.\n\n*Issuing the \"sleep\" command in Alfred.  This puts the display to sleep but doesn't require password immediately after.\n\n*Issuing the \"lock\" command in Alfred.  This requires password immediately but doesn't put the display to sleep.\n\n*Using the \"sleep computer\" action in BetterTouchTool.  This works exactly like its counterpart in Alfred; no password is required if the computer is woken immediately.\n\n*Using the \"lock screen\" action in BTT.  This isn't working for me at all.\n\n\nA: I still believe a single keyboard shortcut should be possible, but as I can't seem to achieve that, the next best thing is two shortcuts which work in extremely rapid succession:\nCtrl-Cmd-Q to lock the screen (the built-in keyboard shortcut); followed by:\nEsc, to go from the lock screen to sleep.\n", "Q: how to enlarge size picture ahead of pdf Macbook I have the following issue:\nI have a pdf file, a comic book.

Preview is 'placing the JPEG' on an empty page, which is why you're getting the white margin.\nYour best option is open the JPEG in Preview and use \"Export...\" (NB: not \"Export As PDF\". This will create a PDF without margins, and you can drag this into place.\nThe other option is use a DTP package to correctly size the image on the page format you want, without margins.\n", "Q: How can I set up a shortcut on macOS Monterey to delete selected files? I have the following shortcut:\n\nThe delete action seems to run when I click the \"Yes\" button in the dialog, just like it should. I know this because I was asked for permission to allow it to run the first time I tested the shortcut. However, the file that I had selected in Finder was still not deleted!\nI feel like I'm going crazy here...it took me two hours of Googling just to come up with this seemingly-simple combination of actions, and still nothing. What am I doing wrong?\nMTIA for any advice/guidance given :-)\nPS: In case it isn't obvious, I am a complete noob when it comes to Applescript or anything to do with the new Shortcuts feature in Monterey. It's been years since I last used a Mac so any answerers should please ELI5 :P Thanks again!\n\nA: You can reference the input files directly by using \"Get Variable\" and then attaching the Delete function.\n\nHowever, as a precaution macOS will still ask you another time if you want to allow the shortcut to delete the file, so you might want to handle the file deletion directly in the AppleScript using something like\nif answer = \"Yes\" then\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        delete file input\n    end tell\nend if\n\nKeep in mind that this will only work if the input is a single file, not a folder or multiple selected files so you'd have to take additional steps to handle those cases. Also, the files are not immediately deleted but instead moved to the trash. Personally I'd suggest thinking about going for a Shell Script solution instead.\n\nA: With the help of @KevinGrabher and a bit more Googling, I managed to come up with the following partial solution:\n\nThis mostly works, but the keyboard shortcut that I've tried to set up in the right sidebar doesn't. I'll post a separate question about that and link to it from here when I'm done.\nEDIT: It seems as though all that was needed to get the shortcut to work was a system restart!

It was created for performance optimization for remote Time Machine backups on a networked hard drive (or other NAS or fileserver), but for local use, you probably want something that is just a single file. If you want to preallocate the whole 100MiB on disk even before you write anything to the virtual disk, then use UDIF (UDRW) and you'll get a ~100MiB .dmg file containing a ~100MiB virtual filesystem. If you want the image file to start out small and only grow to ~100MiB when you fill up its virtual filesystem, then use SPARSE, and you'll get a small .sparsefile image that grows up to ~100MiB as you copy files into the virtual filesystem.\nBy specifying the size you want it to be (and not giving it an input folder to build the disk image around), it assumes you want a blank image with a filesystem of that size.\nAs is standard for the Unix command line, if you specify the name of a new file without a path, it's assumed you want it created in the directory you're currently in; that is, in the shell's current working directory, as reported by the pwd (print working directory) command.\n", "Q: MacBook Air cycle count history I know how to check the cycle count on a Mac but does anybody know how to check the history of when each cycle count increased along with the date?\n\nA: I don't think this information is logged.

But how?\n\nA: iPhones [& all Apple devices] will send to iMessage if the recipient has a current iMessage account & presence online.\nIt will only revert to SMS if it cannot trace the iMessage account or cannot get through on the only device with iMessage enabled. It considers SMS to be \"last resort\" & will avoid at if at all possible.\nTherefore, as your Mac is capable of receiving it & is online, it will never divert to SMS.\nI think your only solution would be to remove your iCloud account from the possible receiving addresses & use only your phone number. That would likely disable iMessage altogether on the Mac.\nMessages prefs -\n\n\nI think if you disable all 'can be reached' except the phone number & 'start new from' your phone number, this might be enough; otherwise disable the account on the Mac.\nNote, if you or your correspondents pay for SMS it could affect billing.\nAlso see - How to tell Messages \"I'm not at home\"?\n", "Q: How to remove .Trash folder from iCloud? There's an invisible folder in my iCloud folder -> .Trash\niCloud seems to sync the mac's trash folder to the cloud. How do I remove/exclude it from there? If I try to delete it conventionally I get error code -50.\n\nA: Golden Rule: Don't play with .Trash folders. Leave them alone.\nThe way macOS handles the myriad Trash folders right across your computer is not to be played with. Every user has one, every drive has one, local or remote mounted, every iCloud sync account has one, the system itself has one.\nDon't touch. Consider them 'voodoo'.\nYou can easily see them if you Show Invisibles  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   . \nHere are a few, including the one in iCloud Drive.\nNote they don't all even have the same name - .Trash vs Trash vs .Trashes - another part of the 'voodoo'.\n\n\nA: The .Trash in your iCloud Drive only stores the trash of your iCloud Drive, meaning if you delete a file/folder in iCloud, it will be moved to .Trash, and finally be deleted once you empty the trash on any device that syncs with iCloud Drive.\nFiles you delete on your Mac that are not in iCloud Drive will not be moved (and therefor uploaded) to your iCloud Drives .Trash folder (instead they land in the appropriate .Trash such as the one in your user folder (~/.Trash)).\n", "Q: How to delete line 7 in a file in Bash with sed?

How can I make the zoom factor larger without losing resolution, like in Windows?\n\n\nA: If you are making 'virtual pixels' that are larger than the screen's native resolution, then they will inevitably be less sharp.\nThere is an essential difference in how Windows and MacOS render text: Windows employs a 'nearest pixel' approach, which can be sharper but is less accurate; MacOS keeps the exact dimensions, which therefore has to be represented using aliasing for 'sub-pixel' fractions. This can appear blurry on displays with a density below 110ppi.\nMacOS is designed for hi-density displays. If your 1080p display is 24\", then the pixel density is c. 92ppi. A 27\" display is 82ppi. Mac Retina displays are around 220ppi.\n", "Q: Contacts: no importable cards were found Just leaving this here in case someone hits this annoying snag.\nThis in MBP 2018 Touch bar running Monterey 12.1\nAfter allowing \"Contacts\" in iCloud, most of my Contacts vanished.

From an old Time Machine backup (Backups.backupdb folder) on a physical external disk I would like to extract some snapshots to other external disks as complete machine volumes. These resulting volumes don't need to be bootable, but if they are, even better.\nHow can I do this? A command line solution would be the best. I had a look at hdiutil, but wasn't sure whether it can help with this problem.\nBackground:\nI am coming to this because I would like to archive old Time Machine backups (El Capitan system), but I have huge problems to copy the whole Time Machine folder to other locations. (I'm now on Mojave.)\nTherefore I thought I extract instead some snapshots of the Time Machine  as complete system volumes to separate disk images. These volumnes should look like the original disk when the snapshot was created.\n\nA: I know that you are preferably looking for a command line solution, but have you checked Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper to see if they shouldn't be able to copy the whole Time Machine folder to other locations? They are usually very good at deep system integrations in terms of copying files…\n\nA: You can extract a snapshot from a Time Machine backup to an external hard drive vai tmutil:\nsudo tmutil restore /Volumes/TMdrive/Backups.backupdb/machinename/2021-11-30-042315/MyHD /Volumes/Safety-HD\n\n(where Safety-HD is the harddrive with the full machine volume and TMdrive is the Time Machine backup drive).\nTwo caveats:\n\n*\n\n*On the resulting hard drive the files and folders from the normal machine root are moved into a sub folder (see this question).\n\n\n*I don't think this works with an old Time Machine backup which is not associated with the computer you are running the command from.

That appears to be installation of the Xcode CLT. MacPorts and Homebrew both require CLT, so I don't believe there's a way around that.\nHowever, as an ad-hoc solution, you could create an alias for your shell that would allow you to run the X86 arch version of git. It's a slightly different process for zsh vs. bash, but details for setting up aliases for both are covered in this article.\n", "Q: Where is my iMac A1419 SSD? I’m trying to upgrade my iMac A1419 (late 2013 iMac14,2) model SSD from 256 Gb to 2 Tb. I watched a lot of videos how to do it, but when I opened my iMac I found the place where usually the HDD is located empty! Where is the SSD? Is it still possible to upgrade with 2.5\" SSD drive?\n\n\nA: Where is the SSD?\nThe PCIe SSD is located on the back side of the logic board above the USB and Thunderbolt ports. The red arrow in the image below points to the connector where the SSD would plug into. You need to remove the logical board to exchange the SSD. I good video showing the steps is given here. I would post directly from the video, but the video usage policy instructs not to.\nIs it still possible to upgrade with 2.5\" SSD drive?\nIf the power and data connectors exists on the logic board, then the answer is yes. The green arrows in the images below point to the power connector where the SATA cable would plug into. The yellow arrow in the image below points to the data connector where the SATA cable would plug into.\nYour model Mac can have a SATA drive and/or a PCIe drive installed. The SATA drive can be a HDD or SSD. The PCIe drive is a SSD, which would be faster than a SATA SDD or HDD. If you Mac does not have SATA drive, then there may not be a SATA cable and 3.5\" drive mounting hardware included with your Mac. I do not see this cable or hardware in the image you posted.\n\nThe above image was taken from this webpage.\n\nCurrently, the SATA cable and 3.5\" drive mounting hardware is available for purchase off the web in used (and perhaps new) condition. For example, this website offers both the cable and hardware. Below is an image of the cable and hardware.\n\nTo install a 2.5\" SATA SSD, additional items will be required. Below is an example of what OWC offers. There are probably other suppliers that offer similar items. First, OWC offers a NEWER TECHNOLOGY ADAPTADRIVE 2.5\" to 3.5\" Drive Converter Bracket, which is shown below. You would mount the 2.5\" SATA SSD in the bracket. According to OWC, this bracket will work both with OWC SSDs and SSDs from other manufacturers.\n\nSecond, OWC offers a In-line Digital Thermal Sensor for Hard Drive Upgrade for 27\" Apple iMac Late 2012 to Mid 2019 Models, which is shown below. This plugs in between the SATA cable and the ADAPTADRIVE bracket. The thermal sensor is to be attached to the metal surface of the SSD by the included adhesive. According to OWC, this sensor will work both with OWC SSDs and SSDs from other manufacturers.\n\nReplacing the existing PCIe SSD versus adding a SATA SSD\nReplacing the existing PCIe SSD with a 2 TB upgrade would cost more for the drive. However, PCIe drives are much faster than legacy SATA. OWC sells PCIe SSDs for your Mac which can replace your existing PCIe SSD without the need for purchasing addition parts.

I have just bought the MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) featuring the Apple M1 Pro chip. From previous research I understand that it natively supports 2 additional display monitors, but I need a total of 4, as well as the ability to use USB-A peripherals. I am now researching using hub adapters, but I have doubts about how to proceed. I am researching between the following options from a manufacturer that a close IT-expert friend of mine has recommended:\nFirst option: This option seems to require I buy an additional cable to use the so-called \"host port\". But, it seems like it would allow me to use only 3 monitors, since, I think, this so-called host port is what connects the hub to the computer.\nSecond option: This option is my favourite one so far. This option seems to allow me to use 4 display monitor total, given the number of ports visible. Yet, I am unsure if using external hub adapters which require drivers would actually allow me to run 4 display monitors.\nOf course I plan to call the manufacturer. Yet, I value the opinion of this community, including options from other manufacturers.\nFirst edit\nI now understand that the options listed above are simple hubs; these will NOT allow me to go over the native number of monitors.\nWorth clarifying: I do not intend to try and mess with the hardware to get the computer to support more monitors than what it can actually support. I intend to find a good display adapter, such as those in answer 1, using, e.g. DisplayLink drivers to be able to support more than two monitors (native number), to a total of 4.\nRefined question: Here's an example of something that makes sense to me. THIS EXAMPLE does NOT specify that drivers are M1 Pro compatible (but they seem to given this site) BUT if they were, I could maybe connect two of these to each USB-C port on my computer and go from 2 to 4?\n\nA: I'm not convinced that you can increase the number of supported monitors just by adding a hub with more ports.\nThe graphics capabilities are limited by the power of the GPU and the bandwidth -- the ability of the computer to transmit that much data at one time.\nApple's own specs say 2 monitors for the M1 Pro, and 3 for the M1 Max, which has extra GPU cores and greater bandwidth. This is even though the M1s have 4 ports that could all be connected to displays.\nWhile the base model M1 Pro can support 2 x 6K displays, you can't 'split' those pixels up across more displays, e.g. 3 x 4K.\nThere are specialist devices that can add an extra display via USB:\nhttps://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/displaylink-products-list?field_displaylink_category_value=usb_adapters\nbut they require additional drivers (which may not be M1-native), and the results may 'stutter', freeze, and lag.\n\nA: I found an excellent blog that answers your question:\nhttps://danielcompton.net/2021/07/28/apple-m1-displaylink-multiple-display\nSince links like to go dead on the internet I'll try to summarize the one and only option you have.  That option is DisplayLink.  That doesn't mean you have only one product that will solve your problem, it's that every product that will allow 4 displays on M1 based Mac computers will use DisplayLink GPUs.\nOn Intel based Apple computers there was the option of PCI based GPUs using Thunderbolt.  This is still technically an option but nobody has developed drivers yet to make them work on M1 Macs.  DisplayLink has written M1 Mac drivers for their USB based GPUs, so that's your one and only option so far.\nThere's perhaps dozens of products on the market with M1 Mac compatible DisplayLink GPUs in them.  Look for docks that have any other ports you desire, double check for driver compatibility.  Be aware that the drivers are limited to 4 displays maximum and do not support rotation of the display.  There's likely other caveats, those are perhaps the two complained about the most often.\n", "Q: Time Machine shows no backup after backing up After having set up  my new Macbook Pro 2021 (macOS Monterey 12.1) with migrating data over from my old Macbook Pro, I started a new Time Machine backup on NAS. The backup took several hours and obviously backed up everything to NAS. Subsequent backups reported that they backed up only a few hundred MB, so it looked like everything was working.\nHowever, checking the backup status in the Time Machine prefs, the status reports\nWaiting to complete first backup \n\nChecking the size of the sparsebundle on the NAS, it's said to be approx. 400 GB, so definitely holding an amount of data which meets my expectations for a successful backup.\nI downloaded TheTimeMachineMechanics to find out about any errors, and there I see a message\nBackup failed (104: BACKUP_DELAYED_UNFINISHED_PROTECTED_FILES)\n\nIt looks like the backup has been made, but for some reason it's not fully completed. How to fix that?\n\nThings I tried (possible solutions found in the net):\n\n*\n\n*boot up in safe mode and backup from there\n\n*use Disk Utility and run a repair\n\nbut to no avail.\n\nA: UPDATE\nThis issue seems to be effectively fixed in macOS 12.2 – so first try updating macOS. Implement below work-around only if the update does not fix it for you.\n\nThis can happen when Time Machine tries to backup files that it does not have access to for some reason.\nTo verify that this is the cause, check the log file after Time Machine has finished a backup attempt:\nlog show --style syslog --last 30m  --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info --debug\n\nIn the log, search for entries like these (search for 'access'):\nlocalhost backupd[256]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:EventCollection] Adding event for inaccessible protected file Users/xxxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyWidgetIntentsItems/Data/Documents | EventDatabase.swift:569\n\nAdding event for inaccessible protected file means that Time Machine wants to back these files (or files in these folders), but cannot access them because they are protected. It therefore delays the backup until they become accessible. However, that never happens.\nIt looks like this happens with a couple of folders that are connect to the Find My Mac functionality. I assume they are system protected so they cannot be tampered with, but the fact that Time Machine attempts to back them up, and the system won't let it, seems like a bug in macOS Monterey.\nHow to fix it\nAs a solution to work around this probable bug, all the problem folders must be excluded from the backup. This needs to be done in the terminal, because if you try to select the folders from System Preferences > Time Machine > Options, you will notice that the problem folders are not visible from the file selection dialog, which is probably due to their additional protection.\nFortunately, we can exclude files and folders from the terminal using tmutil addexclusion. In my case, the problem folders were:\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyNotificationsServiceExtension\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyWidgetItems\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyWidgetPeople\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyWidgetIntentsItems\nsudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Users/xxx/Library/Containers/com.apple.findmy.FindMyWidgetIntentsPeople\n\n(copy, paste and execute line by line, and of course replace xxxx)\nOption -p causes the given path to be excluded, even if it does not yet exist, but when it is created in the future. If you have multiple users, remember to do this for each user.\nI recommend that you check the log if there are any additional problems. In my case, only the above folders related to Find My Mac had to be excluded.\nCheck the excluded folders in System Preferences > Time Machine > Options - they should all show a data size on the right – otherwise check for typos.\nAfter that, start a new backup and cross your fingers.\nCredits to this post in the Apple Community by George Harker.\nImportant addition\nI've noticed that data in ~/Library/Containers can be affected, too, and this may happen anytime again even after Time Machine had already been successfully completing backups. In my case, the Amazon Prime Video app created data here which Time Machine claimed to be inaccessible. As a preliminary work-around, I decided to exclude the whole directory /Users/xxx/Library/Containers from Time Machine.\nLooking forward to Apple fixing this!\n\nA: Building off of not2savvy's answer above, I encountered a similar error on macOS 12.4, due to issues with container files from GoodNotes and Amazon Video.\nI ran the below command to see the offending folders\n$ log show --info --style compact --predicate '(subsystem == \"com.apple.TimeMachine\") && (eventMessage like[cd] \"Failed * acquire device lock assertion*\")' --last 24h\n2022-05-23 19:11:42.983 E  backupd[82164:141aa7] [com.apple.TimeMachine:FileProtection] Failed to acquire device lock assertion - deferring copy of '/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/jim’s MacBook Pro/2022-05-23-142425/Data/Users/jim/Library/Containers/com.amazon.aiv.AIVApp/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.amazon.aiv.AIVApp~iosmac.savedState/data.data', error: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=1 \"Operation not permitted\"\n2022-05-23 19:12:27.433 E  backupd[82164:141aa7] [com.apple.TimeMachine:FileProtection] Failed to acquire device lock assertion - deferring copy of '/Volumes/com.apple.TimeMachine.localsnapshots/Backups.backupdb/jim’s MacBook Pro/2022-05-23-142425/Data/Users/Jim/Library/Containers/com.goodnotesapp.x/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.goodnotesapp.x~iosmac.savedState/data.data', error: Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=1 \"Operation not permitted\"\n\nI had deleted these two apps yesterday, and doing this during the initial backup may have led to these issues.

The same holds true for the Lightning Earpods.\n\nThe contacts pins of the lightning connector appear on the bottom of the port. So it makes sense that skewing a little upwards it might get contact - but it means that the pins are worn out. What are my options? Should I try to tinker with some small needle to try to pry the contacts pins up? Is it even feasible?\nIs my diagnosis correct or at least probable?\nPS: Interestingly enough the non-orginal lightning cable which might be a little bit thicker on the ending part - works without pushing the cable up.\n\nA: It is likely that you simply have dirt, dust or various particles blocking the Lightning port so that the cable doesn't fully insert like it is supposed to.\nI would suggest trying to clean the Lighting port on the phone. Use a can of compressed air if you have that, and give it a few, short, bursts while holding the can upright.\nIf this doesn't work, use a gentle tool to mechanically remove the debris.

But this duplicates my big file (if I am correct) - it appears on my Desktop and still exists in the place where it was downloaded to, so it takes double space after copying/pasting it.\nBut I don't want to duplicate it - I just need to move this downloaded file to my Desktop without duplicating it. Of course I still need this file to stay in iCloud.\nSo, the question is: how to get my file, downloaded from iCloud, into my Desktop without duplicating it? I would expect that some cache exists somewhere where this file was downloaded, but I have no idea where it is. If I knew where it was downloaded, then I would just move it from cache right into Desktop without duplicating it by copying/pasting.\n\nA: Local iCloud files are stored in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/. So you could make an iCloud file accessible in ~/Desktop by running\nln ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/PATH/TO/FILE ~/Desktop/\n\nThis assumes that a new file gets created by macOS in case an iCloud download expires (honestly not sure whether this is true).\nIf this is not the case, you can fall back on\n\n*\n\n*removing the local file\n\n*downloading the big file from iCloud via the browser\n\n", "Q: Cannot store files on Time Machine backup drive I needed to format an external hard drive from Mac OS Extended (journaled, encrypted), the only available option was APFS.\nOn this hard drive, I had my time machine backup in Backups.backupdb and several folders with files, for example:\n├── Backups.backupdb\n├── Music\n└── Pictures\n\nWith the new file system, I am not able to use the hard drive for both time machine and files at the same time. When I set it up for time machine backup, the drive is full with snapshots and cannot be modified by me (e.g., store files), for example:\n├── Snapshot 1\n├── Snapshot 2\n└── Snapshot 3\n\nHas this changed? How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: You should not (and cannot) store files in the Time Machine volume. Instead, open Disk Utility and choose Add Volume on the disk. This allows you have a place to store files on the disk.\nVolumes (unlike partitions) share space in the disk. Partitions reserve specific space on the disk and can't be easily adjusted. This isn't an issue with volumes.\n\nA: The only solution that worked for me is to create a separate partition for time machine.\n", "Q: How can I change input source in MacOS using Windows-style Shift + Command shortcut? I've been using Windows for most of my life and at this point I've developed a muscle memory to use Shift + Alt when I want to change language.\nUsing Macbook Air With macOS Big Sur (11.6) as my personal laptop and I was frustrated to learn that I can't simply go to System preferences and assign Shift + Command to change input source... from what I understood you need a 3rd party tool for that.\n\n*\n\n*I've tried Punto Switcher but it crashes from time to time on my M1 Mac and looks like it hasn't been updated in a while.\n\n*Karabiner is confusing to setup and it caused me a kernel panic once.   =(\n\nIs there another small (and preferably free) app that will allow me to assign key shortcuts to input source selection?\n\nA: I've found an app called CommandShift, it allows to change language using \"Command+Shift, Option+Shift, Control+Shift or Fn+Shift\" which is exactly what I need.

(Dock restarting forces wallpaper refresh).\nI have an AppleScript that changes the desktop wallpaper instantly:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell every desktop to set picture to wallpaperPath\n\nbut that only changes the wallpaper on the active space (meaning that if the main desktop is not active, its background will not change).\nI found this question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36185506/how-to-loop-through-all-mac-desktop-spaces which suggests updating wallpaper path values in the SQLite database located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db. This changes the wallpaper at every space which is great but it requires restart of the dock using killall Dock which is undesirable as it disrupts the workflow.\nMy question is - is there some way to combine these two approaches?

I have no preferred language, it can be in C, Swift, Python, Bash, AppleScript etc.\n\nA: Use NSWorkspace and the setDesktopImageURL:forScreen:options:error: method:\n\nsetDesktopImageURL:forScreen:options:error:\n\nSets the desktop image for the given screen to the image at the specified URL.\n\nThis API is accessible through Objective-C and Swift. I presume scripting bridges for python can also access these methods.\nSee the links below for other approaches using AppleScript:\n\n*\n\n*Changing the background image in all spaces\n\n*Can I have a custom desktop wallpaper 'Change Picture' interval?\n\nA: I figured it out.\nI am looping through all available screens and setting the wallpaper using setDesktopImageURL:forScreen:options:error: (based on Graham Miln's answer):\nfor screen in NSScreen.screens {\n    try! NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL(url, for: screen, options: [:])\n}\n\nThis changes the wallpapers seamlessly, without the need for killall Dock on all the screens but only if the desktop is the active space.\nTo make sure the wallpaper is changed when I am on another space (usually a fullscreen app), I added an observer for NSWorkspace.activeSpaceDidChangeNotification on the NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter which sets the desktop images again (using the code above). So whenever I go back to the desktop, this notification is invoked and the wallpaper is seamlessly updated.\nI even went one step further and added the same observer also for the NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification which updates the wallpaper as soon as the device wakes up which is cool!\n", "Q: How do I disable language switch popup? I'm a new member of apple products community and I'm learning how to setup a process I've got used to. One of inconveniences is language switch. When I'm trying to change language I get a popup with language list (see pic below). The problem is it introduces a small delay before change actually applies (which meh but I can live with it) and the bigger problem that if your mouse is around screen center then mouse pointer overrides language selection and you can stuck with one language unless you move the cursor somewhere\n\nI wonder if there is any way to workaround it with OS X built in tools. I'd really like to not install any 3rd party tools or assigning switch to another key - this one works just fine, the only problem is this pop up.\n\nA: I fixed this problem by redirecting fn (change input source) to Left Ctrl+Space (previous input source) through a complex rule for Karabiner-Elements. This fix involves a 3rd party app, but I am not sure whether it is possible to fix this problem without such apps. The key for changing the input source remains the same.\nNote that in the Keyboard section of System Preferences the fn(globe) should be put to \"Do Nothing\" in the Keyboard tab and the previous input source shortcut to Left Ctrl+Space in Hotkeys tab.\nThe complex rule was added to the app through the karabiner.json file in the .config folder.\nThe rule is:\n`{\n   \"description\":\"fn -> previous input source\",\n   \"manipulators\":[\n      {\n         \"from\":{\n            \"key_code\":\"fn\"\n         },\n         \"to\":[\n            {\n               \"key_code\":\"fn\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"to_if_alone\":[\n            {\n               \"key_code\":\"spacebar\",\n               \"modifiers\":[\n                  \"left_control\"\n               ]\n            }\n         ],\n         \"type\":\"basic\"\n      }\n   ]\n}`\n\n\nA: Working solution: https://github.com/norflin321/fn-lang-switcher.\nWith use of python script, but the result is identical except there is no popup and not way to select wrong language with mouse, and it works a little bit faster!\n", "Q: '/usr/local/bin/curl' and '/usr/local/bin/ssh' commands are killed when executed in macOS Monterey I recently updated my M1 MacBook Air to macOS Monterey (I'm not sure if this is related to the problem though), and now my curl and ssh commands in /usr/local/bin don't function at all.\n\n*\n\n*Both commands immediately exit with zsh: killed     *cmd*\n\n*In a bash shell the output is Killed: 9\n\n*Both of these binaries in /usr/bin work fine.

I've got a new MacBook Pro 16\" 2021 with a Pro M1 processor. It is specced to use a 140W MagSafe power adapter.\nI already have a USB-C dock (a Belkin Thunderpolt 3) through which I have connected two external monitors, ethernet, and other USB devices. The dock also delivers up to 85W power. It is very convenient since I only need to connect a single USB-c to the MacBook to get all external data connections.\nThe dock delivers \"only\" 85W but, for convenience, I would like to connect just the USB-c cable to the dock, and not have to also connect the 140W USB-C power adapter. Would acting that way have any negative consequences?\nPutting it another way: The maximum power that can be fed to the MacBook is 140W. Does that mean that during some usages of the MacBook it actually needs 140W to function optimally?\nIf it needs more than 85W, will it \"take\" some power from the battery? From my usage so far, the battery is constantly full, and the MacBook has been working well.\nI do have some heavy usages scenarios: I do compilations of large amounts of code. Will the performance of those potentially be worse if the MacBook is only connected to 85W?\n\nA: The macbook will take power from the battery if it can’t get enough from the charger for the current load.\nIf the battery needs charging then it will charge at whatever rate possible that is left after supplying the load. So, it will likely be slower or, if you have a large load, the battery may not charge at all and discharge.\n", "Q: Does macOS Monterey automatically install apps to folders?

It has been working flawlessly up to maybe 6 months ago, where it started being insanely slow. I have identified the cause to be the dreaded kernel_task, that uses all my CPU.\nThe problem starts right after booting (maybe even during booting, it is very slow as well). The system CPU usage is constantly at 65-85%, where the free CPU can be 0.2-25%. The kernel_task is a 200-1000%. As it starts during booting, I don't believe it is actually high temperatures. Also the fan is very silent and the computer does not appear hot. There is no difference if I am on battery or power source. Ambient temperature is probably 21oC. When starting the Mac, I have to hold the start button until the apple logo appears, as it otherwise won't start.\nHere is a view of the activity monitor:\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*De-dust the macbook\n\n*Update to the latest IOS\n\n*Reset to factory settings and remove everything\n\n*Deactivate turbo boost\n\nWhat I have tried for screening the problem\n\n*\n\n*Run \"sudo powermetrics --samplers smc\" in terminal.

Resetting it did improve, as I before generally had <1% CPU available, but it is still not doing great.\n\nA: Since there is no clear hint as to what's causing kernel_task to use >200% CPU at boot, we need to start at first principles and examine what the kernel is doing. The way to do this is by collecting and analyzing a spindump. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes.

You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet:\n sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n\n*Perform the minimum actions that are necessary in order to put the system into its high-CPU usage state. In your case maybe this just means waiting a few moments.\n\n\n*As soon as you begin to feel the slowness, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while it's running, otherwise you will distort the data collection.\n\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question.

I'm not quite sure about the reason, as it seems that this mode of operation (mDP to two independent HDMI screens) is supported by Windows devices.\nI am aware of the fact that I can connect two screens featuring thunderbolt-ports in series to achieve the same result, but I need two independent HDMI streams from the computer. Why can this not be achieved (or if so how)?\n\nA: Two displays from one DisplayPort connection requires \"multi-stream transport\", and Apple does not support this.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Multi-Stream_Transport\nThere are video adapters from DisplayPort to two HDMI ports, and these would be supported by Windows and Linux but not on macOS.  I've come across people on the internet that claimed getting two displays from one port on Apple computers running macOS but it does seem quite clear that Apple does not support this function.  Without any official support for this your chances of it working consistently for you are slim.\nThe hardware in Apple computers is capable of supporting MST, so that's not stopping you.  This is proven quite clearly with people booting Windows or Linux on their Apple computers and getting MST adapters and displays to work.  Apple did not include support for MST in their OS or drivers.  We can all speculate as to why.  To get this working would involve some \"hack\" so there is no simple answer to your question other than it won't work.\nSo, yes, this is supported in Windows and if you boot your 2014 vintage Mac with Windows it would take only a MST DisplayPort to dual HDMI adapter to do as you wish.  Assuming you wish to run macOS on your Mac computer then you will not get it working, or rather your chances are pretty slim.\n", "Q: Changing System Sounds macOS Monterey 12.0.1 (21A559) Hello so I would like to change the system sounds on this version of macOS as I find the new ones to be quite annoying specificity sounds with in the following path /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds and I would like to change it with a set of sounds used in macOS Catalina and for reference here are my Specs\n\nA: I initially posted that I was able to do this, but I was wrong.\nI am able to change the sound files as I describe below, but somehow the original sound files are restored when the system reboots. I can't figure out how that is done, but it is happening on my system. So the result is that after all the effort, the sound files are effectively not changed. I apologize for not testing more thoroughly before I posted earlier.\nIf someone can explain to me how the reboot is restoring the original sound files, maybe I could fix it.\nHere's what I did and what happened.\nThe systems sounds are in /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds as described above. For example the unbelieveably annoying sound made when a file is moved is /System/..../SystemSounds/system/Volume Mount.aif.\nFor an Intel Mac, all you had to do was override the System Integrity Protection and then copy a new sound file into a file of the same name using a sudo cp command in a terminal window.\nBut in the newer macOS versions, the files are in the operating system partition which is mounted as read-only. You can't change anything unless you unmount the partition and remount it as rw.\nSo what you have to do is boot the system from an external drive. Once you have done that, you can unmount the partition and remount it as rw. After that, you can copy the new files into place.\nSo the steps are:\n\n*\n\n*boot your computer from an external drive\n\n*unmount the partition (e.g. sudo umount /dev/disk6s1 or whatever disk it is)\n\n*remount the partition (e.g. sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk6s1)  in the absence of any flags it will remount as r/w.\n\n*cd /Volumes/[nameOfDisk]/System/Library/..../system\n\n*cp [pathToNewSoundFile]/Volume\\ Mount.aif\nYou can find clues to the physical disk name by typing diskutil list in a terminal window.\nBecause Apple has tied two partitions together, i.e. the OS and the data partitions, you will have to unmount and remount both partitions.\nSecond, you need to be able to boot from an external drive. You can install the OS on an external drive by using the Recovery App, which is well documented elsewhere.\nHowever, when the system reboots from the drive that you just modified, somehow the original sound files are restored. I tried locking the new files and making sure that the original files were not in the trash, but they were still deleted. As a test I created extra files in the directory, but the entire directory is regenerated somehow. Nothing I tried worked.\nI would think that the sound files, and perhaps the entire SystemSounds directory, is copied from somewhere. If this is true and someone knows where it is copied from, it might be possible to change the source files.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You can add your own system sounds without messing with the operating system copies; no SIP disabling or overwriting files.\nCreating Personal Sound Folder\nFirst and foremost, you just need to make a personal sounds folder /Users/myusername/Library/Sounds. Replace 'myusername' with whatever your login is. You can either do this from the terminal, or from Finder using the \"Go\" menu and selecting \"Library\", and creating the Sounds folder if it doesn't exist.\nAdding Personal Sounds to the Mac\nNext, take the sounds you want to use and drop them into that folder. They will now be visible as available sounds from the System Preferences -> Sounds control panel.\nFile Formats and Conversion\nA word on the sounds, however. First, they might need to be converted. I've only tried AIFF (the default) and WAV formats; MP3, for example, won't work. If you need to convert a file, either search the web for 'AIFF converter' or you can install a tool \"sox\" which is a universal sound format conversion tool and can be as simple as:\n$ sox input.mp3 output.wav\n...you can then copy that output.wav into the ~/Library/Sounds folder and it will appear in the Sounds control panel the next time you launch it.\nDuplicate Filenames\nSecond, the Sounds control panel will list them by their filename, but will not make the distinction if they come from the /System folder (the ones Apple supplied with macOS) or if they were found in your ~/Library/Sounds folder. As such, files with the same name - despite different extensions like wav/aiff/etc - will appear twice in the selection list. So, try to make them unique.\nReplacing Newer macOS Sounds With Older Versions\nFinally, if the goal is that you don't like the new version of macOS \"Funk\" (I don't), then get a copy of the older Funk.aiff from an older macOS installation, copy it to your new Mac and rename it something like 'Funk_older.aiff' instead, so that way it is unique in the selection.\n\nA: It's possible that some steps are unnecessary, but this is what's worked for me on MacOS 12.5.1 for an M1 mac (CAVEAT EMPTOR: At the very least, you will not be able to enable FileVault after this.). The \"trick\" is to disable authenticated-root, create a snapshot and mark it for boot.\n\n*\n\n*First, reboot to recovery (hold power button, after shutting down), disable SIP and authenticated root with csrutil disable and csrutil authenticated-root disable\n\n*Back in MacOS, figure out your boot volume with diskutil list. The boot volume should be the one name Macintosh HD by default. In my case it was disk3s1.\n\n*Create directory to mount the volume to, e.g. mkdir -p -m777 ~/root\n\n*Mount the volume, e.g. sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/disk3s1 ~/root\n\n*open ~/root and make your changes. Finder will still display the read-only symbol, but you will be able to authenticate when you make changes.\n\n*Once finished, create a system snapshot. I named mine \"usermod\" sudo /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs_systemsnapshot -v ~/root -s \"usermod\" output should be something similar to: Attempting creation of snapshot usermod on volume: /Users/USERNAME/root\n\n*Then mark this snapshot as the one to boot from with: sudo /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs_systemsnapshot -v ~/root -r \"usermod\", output should be something like: Attempting tagging of snapshot usermod2 on volume: /Users/USERNAME/root\n\n*Check with diskutil apfs listSnapshots disk3s1, output should be something like:\n\nSnapshots for disk3s1 (2 found)\n|\n+-- SOME-UUID-HERE\n|   Name:        com.apple.os.update-HEXADECIMALSTRING\n|   XID:         27720\n|   Purgeable:   No\n|\n+-- SOME-OTHER-UUID-HERE\n    Name:        usermod2\n    XID:         52281 (Will root to (boot from) this snapshot)\n    Purgeable:   Yes\n\n(9. After making additional changes, you can delete snapshots with sudo diskutil apfs deleteSnapshot disk3s1 -uuid UUID-OF-THE-SNAPSHOT)\nIt would be great, if we could override system paths with synthetic.conf somehow.\n", "Q: App Store charge for \"Premier (Automatic Renewal)\" Today I received an emailed Apple / App Store receipt for a $29.95 charge.\n\nYour receipt from Apple.\nPremier (Automatic Renewal) $29.95\nPremier (Automatic Renewal) (Monthly)\n\nI don't recognize this \"Premier (Automatic Renewal)\" charge.\nIs it an in-app purchase?

My understanding is basically I need to replace the GUID Partition Map with the proper partitions. The disk had two only two partitions - the standard EFI System Partition and then the other one. Drive is a Crucial MX500 SSD 1 TB.\nCan someone please help with the calculations and commands to restore the partitions?\n\nA: The output you have posted does not indicate any problems with the partition map. The output does indicate the drive is in the wrong USB drive enclosure. The drive has a 512 byte sector size and the USB enclosure is silently converting 512 byte sectors to 4096 byte sectors. Your best option here is to find an enclosure that does not do this conversion. Otherwise, proceed as follows.\n\nNote: The OP indicated in a comment that the problem was solved by changing enclosures. Therefore, the answer below was never used.\n\nBelow is what the output from gpt -r show disk0 looked like when the drive was being used by the now fried the machine.\n    start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640 1953115488      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n 1953525128          7         \n 1953525135         32         Sec GPT table\n 1953525167          1         Sec GPT header\n\nThe two partition entries shown in the above table can be converted from a 512 byte sector size to a 4096 byte sector size by dividing by 8.

This would be the FAT32 formatted EFI partition.\n\n\n*The size in 4096 bytes sectors of EFI partition is 51200. This is below the minimum of 65527 required by the FAT32 format. This is stated in the Microsoft article UEFI/GPT-based hard drive partitions. The pertinent part is shown below.\n\nSo, either problem separately or together results in an unusable EFI partition. If you are only interested in mounting the APFS volume(s), then you can enter the commands given below. These commands were derived from klanomath's answer to the question How to fix Mac hard drive partition showing as FDisk_partition_scheme.\n\nNote: You will only be adding the APFS container to the new GPT.\n\nBelow I assume your external drive is still disk3.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 count=6 of=/dev/disk3 \nsudo gpt create /dev/disk3\nsudo gpt add -b 51205 -i 1 -s 244139436 -t apfs disk3\n\nSteps Needed to Move the EFI Partition\n\nNote: Since the OP indicated interest in transfer information from the old HD, I only outlined the steps. I assume the OP is going to erase the entire drive once the information is transferred. If so, then the OP can ignore this section.\n\nThese steps leave the EFI partition at the end of the drive. When testing formatting operations which require an EFI partition, macOS seems to accept an EFI partition that is not at the beginning of the drive.\n\n*\n\n*Use the Disk Utility to create a sparse disk image of a large enough drive so a EFI partition would be automatically created.\n\n*Use the dd command to copy the EFI partition from the external drive to EFI partition in the disk image.\n\n*Create the empty GPT, then add the APFS partition.\n\n*Use the diskutil command to shrink the APFS partition by at least 300 MiB.\n\n*Use the gpt command to create a 300 MiB EFI partition below the APFS partition.\n\n*Use the newfs_msdos to FAT32 format the new EFI partition with the volume label EFI.\n\n*Mount both EFI partitions and use the Finder to copy the contents from EFI partition on the disk image to the EFI partition on the external drive.\n\n*Unmount both EFI partitions, then eject the disk image and place sparse disk image file in the trash.\n\nOther References\nUSB adapters silently change sector size\n", "Q: Where does Safari find the files that it uses for the icons in tabs It is very easy to find information about how to deal with problems in Safari tab icons--namely \"fix the problems by clearing the icon cache.\" That is not what this question is about.\nI have several web sites.

I'll leave it on overnight and see what garbage it downloads but its just a complete mystery what is behind it, and I have to see what the 40K is so I can deleted it.\nI do get an enormous amount of spam that I delete regularly but I suspect the deleted mail is not being cleared from the cPanel server and remains hidden from view in the backend somewhere.\n\nA: OK - after 4 hours I've found the issue. There were 33K versions of the same email on the cPanel server - but it was right in the middle of the 40K of messages so took a ton of page turning in Roundcube to uncover it. They weren't downloaded to the local client so that's why they remained hidden. FFS that was an effort. As usual the support people are of little help as they insist its all somehow the users fault, even though I insisted there was something hidden in there clogging up the works that I wanted them to uncover via the backend.\n", "Q: Deleted Recovery partition (T2 chip Macbook pro).

As per Apple's instructions I reformatted the external HD with the new name and plugged it into the Time Capsule. I immediately got a notification on my computer asking me if I wanted to do a Time Machine backup on the newly named HD. I thought \"great\" and said yes... and then it refused to recognize it after that.\nIn Time Machine preferences the new HD didn't appear, only the old Time Capsule. I go to AirPort Utility to the Time Capsule and go to Edit/Disks; \"Enable file sharing\" is turned on but only the Time Capsule appears there, not the new HD.

Can system interact with internet without being logged in?\nWhen user starts the system and login page appears, it seems to automatically connect to the WiFi. Now, can system interact with internet (send/receive data and apply in system) without being logged in but when user is waiting for entering password on the login screen? By system I meant any system app, services, utility with permission granted.\n\nA: Yes.\nA simple example is Find My. macOS can receive instructions from Find My to lock or erase a Mac before any user has logged in. This requires macOS to make network requests before login.\nTo determine what is making connections on your Mac before login, you can use Little Snitch. Create a rule to ask for any connection, then monitor the ‘login connections’ list (see Does Little Little Snitch 4 block connections during login?).\n", "Q: macOS Calendar stuck at \"Updating calendars...\" I launched the Mac Calendar app, only to see no calendars or events.\nI quit the app, but on restart it now shows \"Updating calendars...\" and a never-ending progress bar...\n\nQuitting the app doesn't work.

See this note.\nSo you should be able to use ABC with any language that it is able to type and still have the right spellcheck by adjusting those settings.\n\nA: I have this \"problem\" all the time with friends and family who communicate with me in Italian.  So, I often need to send emails in Italian.\nThe ONLY email app I can find that does spell check in Italian, using a USA keyboard, is POSTBOX.

It is not possible to overcome this. Otherwise the Mac would (sometimes) want more power that the charge cable can provide.\nIs it possible to disable CPU throttling on a MacBook Pro with a completely dead (not recognized) battery?\nWhy does a MacBook throttle without a battery?\nCPU throttling on Macbook with bad battery and Catalina\nI know this a bad time to be outlaying cash, but you either need a new battery, or a new Mac.\n\nA: You can use Intel Power Gadget, it's an official app from Intel that shows you your processor's current frequency among other things.\nIf you have the Intel Core i5 model then your normal working frequency should be around 1.4GHz and can get up 2.7GHz for more demanding tasks.\nBut please note that a lower frequency doesn't necessarily mean that your laptop \"lowers the CPU\", it might also happen just because your laptop isn't doing anything particularly demanding at the moment and so it allocates only as much CPU resources as it thinks would be enough to get the job done ideally without any noticeable degradation in performance.

( I don't have a backup) How do I find system log files from the last 60 days on Terminal when I don't have a backup?\n\nA: macOS uses a rolling archive for system logs, keeping the 10 most recent logs available in /var/log. If you don't have a backup, anything older than that will not be available.\n", "Q: Using AppleScript, how does one create a clickable link to a web site in a Numbers cell?

During OS update, some people report that the update fails and turns the machine into a brick, forcing them to take it to Apple.\nFail proof: No matter what, you can revert back.\nCan I trust Time Machine? There's no Apple service in this country.\n2015 mbp 13\" from 10.14 to latest stable, time machine backup files are on external device obviously\n\nA: +1 to what everyone is telling you about backups and failures in general. To address your question more directly, though: It is ALWAYS possible for an upgrade to brick your machine. The way this happens is during the firmware update sequence. A botched sequence and/or a buggy firmware image, either EFI or SMC, will render your machine instantly unbootable, and no amount of backups will help you. The ONLY way to make that machine boot again is to manually reflash the broken firmware, which requires special tools that you're very unlikely to have, and therefore must get a third party to help service your Mac.\nThe good news is that Apple goes to extensive lengths to prevent the above scenario, precisely for the reason that a bad firmware update could affect millions of customers and therefore also be catastrophically bad for Apple. That's why there are many firmware QA tests that have to get passed before any OS update is made available to the public. Testing comprises a significant percentage of the time that it takes Apple to release an update. The high risk of catastrophic failure is also why minor OS updates (as opposed to major OS upgrades) introduce few new features and are instead focused on bug fixes and polish: Making fewer firmware changes reduces risk.\nIn your case,\n\n2015 mbp 13\" from 10.14 to latest stable\n\nyou are attempting to upgrade a relatively old machine from Mojave to, presumably, Monterey. This is a +3 major version point jump. Such a procedure, when you can't afford a failure, is not recommended.\nA lot of code at all layers of the stack changes between major upgrades. This constantly leads to situations where Apple has to write migration-specific code that will take data (including nonvolatile, boot-critical data) stored using yesteryear's paradigm and convert it to a newer format.\nApple's upgrade process is most heavily tested for the most common use case, which is a +1 major version upgrade. There is a lot less test coverage given to big leaps like the one that you are taking. The chances that a migration will run into an unhandled corner case are significantly higher when you are leapfrogging 3 major versions.\nThe safer approach (beyond having your data backed up in multiple locations) is to do major OS upgrades one-by-one (i.e, Mojave -> Catalina -> Big Sur -> Monterey, rather than Mojave -> Monterey). Yes, this takes longer, but it reduces the risk that you're going to end up having to erase & restore from your backups (at best) or have a system that no longer boots (at worst).\n", "Q: Monterey - Should AWDL be off?

With OS Monterey (MBP M1), after an app has been launched AND closed, its icon remains on the dock (without the \"open indicator\"). I can manually remove it, but how do I prevent app icons from being automatically added to the dock?\nTo clarify: What I'm asking isn't removing recent apps from showing up on the dock. (To remove recent apps from the dock, see the suggested post)\nWhat I want is this: When an app-not part of the collection of apps on the dock-is opened, it appears on the dock with a separator that keeps it apart of the \"regulars\" on the dock.

In this case, I can't enter my password without unplugging the Yubikey (I can enter the PIN to unlock, of course. But that won't re-enable Touch ID). Is there a way to enter the password instead of PIN without unplugging the smart card?\n\nA: There is a way, you can open system preferences, go to users & groups and enter your password.\nAnother option would be to write a menu bar app that does the same thing.

If you create a Space it will auto-add a default key command, but not enable it. If you create & destroy Spaces, the keys will be removed/switched off each time.* If you use Fullscreen you cannot number their Spaces, so you can only use left/right in Fullscreen.\n*I just double-checked that.

Ctrl/num is the default & what it will auto-set each time you create a new Space.\nAdditionally, if you have an extended keyboard, the numpad & 'qwerty' numbers are recognised separately, but you cannot tell visually from that assignment window. Default keys are for the numbers above qwerty & have to be specifically changed to numpad if you want those.\n", "Q: DEP Enrollment with Virtual Machines I have a company-provided 2019 MacBook Pro that is enrolled in Apple DEP and has Jamf as the MDM provider. (OS Version is Big Sur, 11.6.2)\nFor a side project I created several virtual machines with Parallels and VirtualBox and it quickly turned into another kind of endeavour:\nWith VirtualBox, the OS setup never gets to the \"remote management\" step, just goes on like a generic Mac. But with Parallels, no matter what I do (in terms of configuration), it is always stuck at the \"remote management\" step. (Which I don't want.) I mean, I can opt into it with my VM but the setup won't let me go without it. This is never the case with VirtualBox.\nThis ingrigued me and I have been experimenting and researching about it. Because I am kind of new to the Apple world and want to learn more about it.\nQuestion: How is this even possible? How does the VM (in Parallels) get aware of its outside world and is able to introduce itself (specifically) to my company's MDM server and more importantly how come there is no way to isolate the VM from the company?\nDetails:\n\n*\n\n*I tried the OS installations with (what I believe to be) a clean ISO. Grabbed it from App Store and extracted the ISO using createinstallmedia utility through CLI.\n\n\n*In Parallels, actually, the VM is not readily able to grab the MDM profiles from the server. To obtain them, the machine must have a registered serial number and a correct device id, both of which are configurable within Parallels. During my research, I also verified this is really the case with Apple DEP. But this also means the virtual machine, by default, just has a generic serial number, yet it still able to identify itself with my company. (i.e. Requires the remote management step to be fulfilled.)\n\nA: ANSWER\nThe reason is that Parallels VMs, by default, use the serial number of the physical machine they are running on, even if they are created on a different machine. Therefore, during OS installation, the installer contacts Apple with a real-world DEP-enrolled serial number. (While in VirtualBox the serial number is 0.) This results in DEP enforcement!\nThere is another parameter involved during installation, though, and it is the \"model identifier\" and Parallels do not copy it. Therefore, despite being DEP enrolled and enforced at this stage of the installation, the setup cannot continue because the MDM provider (Jamf, here) refuses to serve the machine with the profile because of the model identifier mismatch.\nSOLUTION\nSolution is to set those two parameters manually for your desired outcome. If you want DEP enrollment, you need a real, registered serial number and a corresponding model identifier. If you DO NOT want to enroll with DEP but want a clean, generic MacOS installation (which was my original goal), then you need to change your serial number to a non-registered one.\nDetailed Instructions for Manipulating Serial Number in Parallels \nInstructions for Enrollment with a Parallels VM\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nInterestingly, staying offline during setup also gets you out of DEP enrollment. But that was not what I wanted.\nAppendix\nIf you want to check for the parameters, for yourself:\n\nSerial Number\nioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber\n\n\nModel Identifier\nsysctl hw.model\n\n\nSystem information utility shows the two fields in hardware overview tab under their exact names.\n\n", "Q: Mac terminal found open with “man James” text.

Open up a Terminal window and the default text is basically [username] — -bash —80x24 and even if you ran man Primary on your own the title would not change to that.\n\nAlso, the output of the bash -x command simply shows the startup commands that are run when a terminal session — or SSH login session to your machine — when you open up a Terminal window. When you run bash -x it opens up Bash in tracing mode as explained here:\n\n”Print a trace of simple commands, for commands, case commands, select commands, and arithmetic for commands and their arguments or associated word lists after they are expanded and before they are executed. The value of the PS4 variable is expanded and the resultant value is printed before the command and its expanded arguments.”\n\nWhich basically means it launches a Bash session in a verbose mode that shows you exactly what Bash is doing when it starts. For example, here is what the bash -x output looks like on my machine:\n+ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n+ PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n+ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n+ PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nMy Bash setup is fairly simple, but if you were to look into the .bash_history, .bash_profile and .bashrc files in your terminal you would see items that are the equivalent of your output in some way.\n\nA: Maybe you've been hacked, maybe you haven't.  But the fact that you got a \"man James\" window open is a poor indicator of a hack, and it's far more likely that you accidentally triggered the opening of that window yourself.\nHere's how it might have been triggered:\n\n*\n\n*Double-click the word \"James\" to select it in some application — for example, on this page in your web browser.\n\n*Hit ⌘-⇧-M on your keyboard, which triggers the \"Open man page in Terminal\" service.\n\nThe telltale indicator that the \"Open man page in Terminal\" service was triggered is the fact that the window opened with a yellow background. If an attacker had opened that window in any other way, they would likely not have gone to the trouble to make it yellow.\nFurthermore, the existence of a keyboard shortcut in the default configuration of macOS suggests that you may have triggered it accidentally yourself. To see where that keyboard shortcut is defined, go to “System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services.”\n\nAs for the bash -x output, it all looks very innocuous to me. Those are just the commands that get run automatically every time you launch a shell, usually silently, to compose the dynamic shell prompt. See /etc/bashrc on an installation of any recent version of macOS.\n\nA: I doubt man James was run directly, i.e. by someone typing that in Terminal. The window in your screenshot shows the default theme for man page output.\nThere is a default text service provided by Terminal that opens a man page for the selected text. I believe the text ‘James’ was right-clicked and the service selected, or selected and the keyboard shortcut pressed.\n", "Q: Maintain Finder's file lock during rsync?

However, files which are \"locked\" in Finder do not show as locked after the rsync operation is complete. How can I replicate the Finder lock during rsync?\n\nA: The version of rsync that macOS provides is about 15-years old and doesn't handle preserving file flags supported by chflags (e.g. UF_IMMUTABLE or \"Locked\" as set with chflags uchg).\nCurrent versions of rsync have:\n\n--fileflags This option causes rsync to update the file-flags to be the same as the source files and directories (if your OS supports the chflags(2) system call).\n\nInstall Homebrew and update rsync to a modern version with:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\nbrew install rsync\n\nIf you are doing a remote transfer, both the sending and receiving hosts must support --fileflags, obviously.\nHowever, if the necessary version of rsync is not in the default\nremote-shell's PATH (i.e. /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin), the path to the requisite version must be specified.

You'd have to set up something similar to a Hackintosh, using particular flags for QEMU and a bootloader such as OpenCore or Clover. It probably isn't worth doing, as you will have pretty bad performance and no graphics acceleration (no graphical effects and everything will be slow and choppy).\nIf you want to do it anyway this (or a similar repo, there are several) would probably help, although you won't be able to use KVM or HVF since virtualization acceleration doesn't work on an emulator, and you'd have to figure out some of the steps yourself as the repo is targeted towards Linux distributions and some things may not work fully on a Mac.\n", "Q: How do you use the open verb in Image Events using AppleScript?

I'm using the supplied 140W charger and MagSafe cable, and it's plugged directly into the wall socket, no adapters.\nI had a similar issue with my iPads (2017 and 2020 Pros) but, in that case it was because there was a mismatch between the charger and the cable (ie the cable was drawing current faster than the charger could supply it which caused the batteries to drain. Once I bought a more powerful charger, the problem resolved itself).\nObviously, this shouldn't be the case here - should I be having a word with Apple about this? Looking at the battery indicator and seeing it on 72% when it's not been unplugged is somewhat unnerving (this laptop was an early Xmas present from my parents to replace my loathed 2016 Touch Bar).\nUnfortunately, despite the nearest Apple Store being just over 3 miles away, ill-health prevents me from making a Genius Bar appointment (should it be warranted). I have AppleCare+ to the end of 2024.\nApologies for what is, probably, another stupid question.\nHappy whatever it is you may celebrate (or not)\nSarah\n\nA: Short answer: No, you shouldn't be worried about it as it is because of the Battery Optimization that knows how to handle your charging i.e. when to charge/discharge your mac.\n\nI kept my new mac plugged-in at all times. For 10-12 days, it used to show full 100% charge but recently it started discharging while plugged in. I was also worried about this, but then I found that the charge didn't go below 80%, that means the machine was learning from my charging routine, how I am charging my mac. Once it has gained sufficient data, it knows that I always keep it plugged in, so it will not charge past 80% to prolong battery's life, you can find more information here\n\nIf you use optimized battery charging in macOS Big Sur or later, or use macOS Catalina or earlier, occasionally the battery might not show a full charge (100%) in macOS, even after the power adapter has been connected for an extended period of time. This behavior is normal and helps prolong the overall life of the battery.\n\n", "Q: Xcode: automatically alpha-sort added files/groups/folders by name in Project Navigator Is there a way of making Xcode automatically sort files/groups/folders by name when a project is created from existing artifacts, a folder is added to the project, or a bunch of files are added to a project?\nThe default behaviour is nonsensical and rather frustrating as it doesn't even match any sort criteria available in Finder.\nEDIT Updated title to reflect what I really want answered.

For security and compliance reasons, the most important criterion would be that these two partitions share absolutely nothing -- no OS, no apps, no data, no shared directories either on the disk itself or on external drives, no access to anything in the other installation, no inclusion in the other installation's time machine backups, ... just nothing ;-) When one instance is running it should be as close as possible to the other installation physically not being existent on the machine.\nMy approach would be creating two partitions, encrypting both of them and installing MacOS on each of them. Is there anything else that I have to do? I am aware of the downsides (\"waste\" of hard disk space, licensing issues of third party apps, etc.) of such an approach\nIf possible I would like to not virtualize one of the two installations due to the loss of RAM and CPU performance. The one thing I have in abundance though is disk space.\n\nA: The operating system is not designed to offer this level of isolation, so you would want to use a virtualization solution like VMWare Fusion and run VM as separate instances and manage the firewalls / sharing preferences to preserve your boundaries.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html\nWe do this at work for dev ops / testing / light remote usage within the boundaries of the Apple OS EULA. A clean OS running only fusion has very low overhead on RAM and CPU and performs very well on both Intel and Apple Silicon hardware across all recent hardware since 2013.\nTo attack the heart of your “problem” - you can’t really isolate log files and application / OS on macOS but you can easily make home folders / DMG / encrypted file stores and isolate folders of files. For that, one OS is sufficient and you just have to be disciplined about storing keys outside of keychains that are amenable to brute force attacks. You really don’t want to let anyone have physical access to your files and when you dual boot, you give up that huge moat in one shot. If you’re OK with a “hostile user” reading the files and sure you can encrypt them, you might have options to single boot, but host / guest isolation is easier for most people to manage. Without knowing your threat model in depth, it’s hard to just say “do this” to secure your files.\nLastly, why not just install your “secure” OK on an external drive? Only bring that to the system when you know the power is off and the “work” OS is not running and can’t snoop on things?\n", "Q: Apple TV from Apple One and Apple TV free trial on new devices conflict I bought a new iPhone for a family member and added them to family sharing. Everything works (Apple Music, Apple Arcade, etc) but not Apple TV.\nThis is because there's a conflict between the Apple One subscription and the Apple TV \"get one year for free\" offer for newly purchased Apple devices.\nWhen the Apple TV app is opened, it offers 1 year for free (even though the subscription from Apple One is active). But when you click to accept the free year of Apple TV, it says that you already have Apple TV through Apple One in a pop-up window. You click \"ok\", and then it keeps telling you that you can get 1 year of Apple TV for free and won't let you play anything... And then it's a vicious cycle, you click to Accept one year for free, and it tells you that you already have it through Apple One again.\nHow do you resolve this problem?\n\nA: This seems like a weird bug from Apple. I found a workaround to get it to work. Steps:\n\n*\n\n*Remove the family member from Apple One.\n\n*Go to Apple TV on their phone, now it will let you accept the free year of Apple TV and won't tell you that you already have it through Apple One. Click to accept one year of Apple TV.\n\n*Now add the family member to family sharing again. And they will have everything working.\n\n*Go to Settings -> Click on the rectangle with your name at the very top -> Subscriptions -> Apple TV (the one that you subscribed to for 1 year free) and cancel it.\n\nThis made everything work for me.\n", "Q: How do I get mdfind to look in /opt? mdfind does not seem to find files in /opt.\ne.g.\n$ mdfind -onlyin /opt -name Dockerfile\n$ \n\nfind produces the expected result\n$ find /opt -name Dockerfile\n/opt/homebrew/Dockerfile\n/opt/homebrew/Cellar/go/1.17.5/libexec/src/crypto/elliptic/internal/fiat/Dockerfile\n$\n\nWhy might /opt be invisible to mdfind?

So basically the two devices are trying to upload the same photos to iCloud, one of them is paused and the other is running.\nWill the iCloud have duplicate photos? How to deal with it?\n\nA: On iOS 15 and lower iCloud tries to sort out duplicates when you import but your case probably won’t be caught since it’s syncing that’s injecting  duplicates.

I recorded a video with my iPhone 12 mini with iOS 15 and I see that the lights at night are overly bright:\n\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: The first thing to always consider when shooting a scene with extreme difference between the darkest & lightest parts is that the human eye has perhaps 5 times the dynamic range of any camera. With a camera you are always going to have to either compress the exposure range, or let one or both extremes 'escape'.\nYou have two issues other than exposure:\n\n*\n\n*Lens flare, the horizontal stripes - which is probably a greasy lens.\n\n*Veiling flare [or glare], which is what happens when a bright light source is shining into the lens from an angle, causing light to bounce around inside the camera body. This causes almost a 'foggy' appearance & reduces the contrast considerably.\n\nUnless you are using multiple bracketed exposures for scenes with high dynamic range [HDR], which you can only really do for stills, then for night shoots on a fully automatic system such as the iPhone you do need to run a couple of test shots. A camera set to 'day' mode of any sort will automatically expose to give a general 'mid grey'. Smartphones will usually post-process this to increase contrast anyway, but that's where they will start.\nExposing for mid-grey at night will make the entire scene too bright, so 'night mode' will be designed for a lower overall grey level. in effect the auto-exposure will just lower what it considers 'correct'. This will bring everything down to make night look like night instead of trying to push it to day.\nIf you use an app that can fix the exposure, this is usually your best bet. Prevent the camera from guessing & tell it what it should do instead. In manual mode you can also dictate the colour temperature - whether or not to treat yellow street lights as 'white' & balance everything accordingly, or allow them to remain yellow. This is an artistic choice.\nYou can bring down the exposure manually after the fact, but where the lamp centres are has already been blown-out. There is no detail left in those areas, the RGB values are 255, 255, 255 so any reduction is just going to treat them as white & reduce to grey. Your eyes assume those centres are still blue-green or orange, but actually they're not, they're white.\nNo amount of post processing can kill the two flares though. The 'damage' has been done.\n\n*\n\n*Veiling flare is often caused by a light outside the frame, at a sharp angle to the lens. if this is the case you could shield the lens as you shoot. Hold up a hand slightly in front & out of shot & wave it around. You'll see the flare vanish as you shade the correct area.\n\n*The hard flare directly from the lights you can attempt to fix by cleaning it ;) Lens flare is likely to still be there in some quantity as all lenses will exhibit this to some degree, but only anamorphic lenses usually flare out that much without encouragement.\n\nI gave the still a quick run through Photoshop to see where I could get. I think it's 'better', ie looks more like night & I've masked a little of the veiling flare, but the lens flares & lamp centres cannot be 'fixed'.\n\n\nA: Here's an example of reducing the hard flare directly from the lights by cleaning the lens, as suggested by Tetsujin.\nBefore cleaning the lens:\n\nAfter cleaning the lens:\n\nWith iPhone 12 mini running on iOS 15.

Both will allow you to create a bootable clone of your current OS on an external volume; then at next startup, hold down the Option key and choose the external volume.\nNote that model Mac mini only supports USB 3.0, so while it'll be faster than the internal drive, you won't get the full performance from a Samsung SSD that supports USB 3.1 or greater.\n", "Q: How can I delete the PostgreSQL user in my mac? because, there is no user in the preference I forgot how I install postgresql before.\nand now I have removed it by following this steps https://stackoverflow.com/a/9240197/12381565 .\n\nBut my postgresql user didn't gone from the taskbar,\nalthough in my user preference is doesn't have it, so I can't remove it again in the preference. \n\nMaybe I deleted it once, but I forgot about it.\nthank you.\n\nA: Just found the solution!\nhere is the link:\nRemove PostgreSQL account from system\n", "Q: Spellcheck stopped working in Monterey 12.1 Spellcheck has stopped working in all my apps since upgrading to 12.1 and/or installing Grammarly.\nMisspelled words are NOT underlined in red.\n-I uninstalled Grammerly\n-I checked to make sure Preferences>Keyboard>Text>Correct Spelling Automatically is checked.\n-And checked to make sure that Edit>Spelling&Grammar>Check Spelling While Typing is checked within each app.\n-I ran Cocktail for macOS, cleared caches, restarted, etc.\nOddly, for some reason, some apps are not showing the checkmark to the right of \"Check Spelling While Typing, but others do.

There have been answers that describe how this can be prevented for Intel Macs using an NVRAM setting, but this AutoBoot setting has no effect on an M1 Mac. There is a similar auto-boot setting in the M1 Mac NVRAM list, which is set to true by default, but setting it to false or %00 will cause the Mac to be unbootable. I have not found a way to prevent boot when the lid is open on an M1 Mac.\n\nA: I tried the sudo nvram auto-boot=false, checked if it registered by sudo nvram -p and it said the value is false. Rebooted and the computer was unusable, could not even try to reset vram, the computer just showed an exclamation mark and a web address for apple support. Looking at on-line documentation it said I needed to \"revive\" or \"restore\" the computer by connecting it to another Apple silicon computer. Went to an Apple center where they told me I had to erase and restore the machine. Came back home, booted in recovery mode and made a last attempt before erasing the computer: pressed the hard disk icon to boot from the internal HD and everything worked again.\nLesson learnt? Always try the simplest things first, before getting into esoterics.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple team didn't add the feature of turning off the autoboot for M1 Chip MacBook(s) although it was there in Intel Chip MacBook(s) partially. You have to wait until any new update comes for M1 Chip which includes turning off the autoboot.\nOtherwise, you can't simply disable for now.\nNote: I have the Intel chip Macbook Pro 2019 in which you can disable the autoboot partially that disables the auto booting up when lid is opened only. But there is a limitation to that. If you press any key or touch the trackpad, it will start booting up which is kind of annoying.\n", "Q: Mac Terminal doesn't obey ANSI \"Show Cursor\" Escape Sequence; Can't Regain Cursor Visibility, suspect State issue System:\nI'm writing a Python 3 script using ANSI escape sequences on an Intel iMac Pro running up-to-date Monterey.\nProblem:\nI hide the cursor when printing a lot of ASCII animations to the screen.  When I'm all done I like to reset the screen as the last action.\nBut sending \"\\033[?25h\" to the screen after a script has ran for a while doesn't bring the cursor back.  If I send the hide code, then just sleep for 3 seconds, then send the show-cursor sequence, it DOES seem to work.\nResearch / Attempts:\nI also had the idea to \"save cursor state\", and then later restore cursor state, but that didn't work either.  I tried both the ANSI settings (ESC[7 and ESC[8) and the VT commands (ESC[s and ESC[u)\nI also tried using curses.curs_set(0) and then later curses.curs_set(1), also didn't work.  Not only does this leave the cursor invisible, but echo of characters is also then disabled, and I think maybe the linefeed gets messed up too.\nI also tried the unix commands \"reset ; stty sane ; clear\", but that still won't reset it either.  This really surprised me; the only workaround left is to open up a fresh terminal tab.\nI saw one post (which I can't find now) which said there was maybe some stateful issue with the Mac Terminal program, that sometimes it doesn't work, but other times it does, depending on what's been previously sent.  This would seem to be consistent with my experience (that if I restore right away it works, but after lots of traffic, it doesn't.  With that in mind, I tried sending the visibility command a bunch of times, that didn't help.\nI've also tried entering the escape strings into the Python code a couple different ways, as in \"\\e[?25h\" and \"\\033[?25h\"; of course that didn't help.\n\nA: I think what we need here is the Curses library. They have the intricacies of common terminal emulators all figured out.

When I came out of Time Machine, I found all my desktop files completely rearranged, which is a major hassle for me.\nUpon pressing shift+command+. I found that this might be because no .DS_Store file exists on my desktop. Is this the real issue? I know that .DS_Store files need to store things like folder positions/icons, but then if such a file was missing, wouldn't I have found my desktop folder rearranged every time I booted?\nWhat is the solution to this issue, can I manually create a .DS_Store file which my Mac can then fill in with the requisite folder info?\n\nA: Working backwards in your questions:\nYou should not attempt to create a .DS_Store file. macOS will create one when needed to hold (as you know) metadata about the folder. Attempts to create and/or modify .DS_Store either don't work (a good outcome) or cause no end of issues.\nRegarding your apparent lack of .DS_Store:\n\n*\n\n*Monterey's Finder does not show .DS_Store even when you enable showing hidden files. This is a change from previous versions. I suggest this is a good thing as the unwary user will not tamper with what can't be seen!\n\n*Nevertheless, the .DS_Store does exist and can be shown in the Terminal app, using the command ls -la.\n\nSo the apparent lack of .DS_Store is not the cause of your problem.\nExactly what happened when you entered and the exited Time Machine, I can't help you with.\nPersonally, I find the weird Time Machine interface unresponsive and unreliable - much worse than in previous macOS. I prefer to use Finder looking directly at the Time Machine backup volume and its snapshots.\n", "Q: Mac connected to iPhone but no internet My mac is connected to my iPhone through USB but I cannot access to internet.

I have an external SSD which I use for lots of work stuff.\nOn both computers, when I open a local Finder window (in Column mode) and select an image, the preview area on the right shows me a selection of metadata about any image I select: dimensions, camera make, etc. This is what I see on the MacBook for a picture on the local drive, for example:\n\nOn the mini, this also holds true for files on the external SSD – but not on the MacBook. On the MacBook, this is what I see:\n\nNo metadata. Doesn’t appear in Get Info either. (There is metadata in this file; the preview area looks like this for all image files on the external drive.)\nEssentially the same issue was troubling someone on Reddit three years ago, but that thread didn’t seem to lead to any kind of answer. I can’t seem to find anything else describing this issue.\nLike the asker there, my external SSD is also not excluded from Spotlight, but unlike theirs, it has a different formatting: the internal drive is APFS, while the external one is exFAT. This is also the case on the mini where it works fine, though, so that doesn’t seem to be the issue in and of itself.\nSo what might be causing metadata from not appearing for files on external drives and is there a way to fix it to get my metadata back?\n\nA: My immediate suspicion would be that the external drive is not being indexed by spotlight.\nGet Info view of the same file on two drives, one indexed, the other not…\n\nFrom comments\nIf the drive appears to be indexed but is still not working, add it to Spotlight Privacy, wait a minute then remove it again. That should force a re-index.\n", "Q: removing pkg installation Is it possible to remove all that was installed by a pkg installer? I read that \"When a package is installed, it creates a “receipt” which contains details about what files and directories were created.\" But does this \"receipt\" always all details about what files were created or is this creation up to the pkg file (thus its developer)?\nMy problem is that when i install some pkg, i want to make sure that even if it contains some spying \"crap\" that it can be removed.\n\nA: The .pkg might well contain all the information about directories and files that were created by the installer.\nBut this is not of much use for malware because running one of those files can create directories and other files and the installer and so the .pkg file will not know anything about them.\nSo the answer is probably yes for a well behaved app but no for malware.\n", "Q: iCloud stuck on \"uploading X items (Y of Y)\" - Monterey 12.1 I hope this can be an interesting topic also for those not affected by it.\nSome context first: MacBook Pro 2016 (15\"), macOS Monterey 12.1, iCloud+ 200GB subscription.\nWhile it may happen from time to time for iCloud to get stuck during upload, this has been happening to me quite frequently ever since upgrading to Monterey.\nSyncing works normally, but iCloud seems to be processing an increasingly large amount of files which are marked as \"to upload\". Looking in Finder there is no dashed cloud, and I just see this:\n\n\nNow, what have I already done?\nRestart Mac; shut down wait and boot; reinstall macOS; boot in Safe Mode; signed out of iCloud > restart > sign in (with the included pain of having to sync again 100+GB of data); nothing seems to have a definitive healing effect.\nThe only thing that seems to work around it, and that may lead to a cause is:\nTurn off Wi-Fi, wait until all system has gone offline\nRestart Mac, wait until all login items are loaded (and have realised there's no connectivity)\nTurn on Wi-Fi, wait and do not launch any apps, just launch Finder\nHere you will see the items count slowly but steadily declining until it all syncs back to normality.\nIt appears to me that something has gotten stuck, or that something is keeping some files from uploading.\nI have used two utilities (Consolation and Cirrus) to browse the log and indeed when this happens iCloud seems to be stuck in a loop, but no relevant info is present there.\nFor records, I have a pretty fast WiFi (up to 600/250 Mbps), but I have also suspected the ISP doing something I have no idea how to check that is boggling my connectivity.\nHas anyone encountered this issue, or does anyone have an idea of what could be going on here?\nIs there an Apple-approved/recommended procedure to get out of it? Log out/in is no longer an option for me as it didn't solve it.\nThank you\n\nA: Thanks to the second level of Apple Support I could get to the bottom of this. My iCloud Drive is working perfectly fine, but it was trying to sync files from very specific sources that should not be there. I will now list what you should look at if your iCloud gets stuck and following instructions here and here does not help.\n\n*\n\n*If you are using CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) to backup anything to iCloud Drive, just stop doing that. I have had an exchange with Mike Bombich from CCC, who advised me not to do so. The reason is that iCloud seems not to like when you are adding an item of the same name to a folder, forcing it to change its name temporarily, then remove the old version, and rename the more recent one. If you can avoid it, do so, otherwise, just do not use the SafetyNet feature in addition to it.\n\n*If you use Avid Sibelius, do not back up (using any backup/cloning software) files in /Library/Application Support/Avid/Sibelius to iCloud Drive.\n\nShould this not get you unstuck, you need to perform a manual search in your Finder > iCloud Drive folder for any folder which has this symbol:\n\nInside those folders, look for any file that has a cloud with either dotted or solid stroke. Check what is going on and, if on mouseover it tells \"Waiting to Update\", then that file is having a problem.\nTry to remove it from iCloud Drive to somewhere local and see if the number of items stuck is diminishing. If so, continue until you solve the issue and then try to put back those files one by one.\nI hope this can help others.\n\nA: In my experience it is caused by files with the same name. Once I rename the offending file, it clears up. The trick is finding the file.\n\nA: Deleting or renaming ~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs can force a resync of all iCloud Drive files on your Mac.\nSource: https://sleonproductions.com/how-to-fix-icloud-drive-stuck-at-uploading-in-mac/\n\nA: I had the same problem for a very long time. Tried everything. Called Apple support and got to third level support but then the problem seemed to fix itself so never got a resolution from them. Even total reinstall of the OS didn't work.\nLast night, I decided to focus some effort on the problem and I think it finally paid off. Here's what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Completely wiped out everything in icloud, including the folders for specific apps (automator, keynote, numbers, garageband).\n\n\n*In a folder like Keynote, I deleted and non-keynote files which somehow ended up in there like stray PDFs, etc.\n\n\n*Completely logged out of icloud by logging out with my apple ID.\n\n\n*Logged back in to icloud with apple ID\n\n\n*Rebuilt the app folders by opening the apps and saving a file to the icloud.\n\n\n*Moved old files back in.\nSince then, everything has been working well. Fingers crossed. My best guess is the sync with the app folders got corrupted.\n\nA: You don't have to force a resync or mess around with deleting files.\nOn MacOS Ventura, go to settings, iCloud Drive -> Options in Apps Syncing to iCloud Drive 1. Uncheck Desktop & Documents folders and it'll show a message stating documents won't be synced anymore. Agree to it, and once it's unchecked, check it again. You won't see that uploading message anymore and you don't have to resync your files\n\n\nA: I have a command line solution that works for me every time by dismissing that annoying stuck \"uploading to iCloud\" progress indicator.\nIn Terminal.app, the command killall bird does the trick.\nThe man pages for bird specifically states...\n\nusers should not run bird manually.\n\nFrankly, I don't care if it is not recommended to run manually.  It's annoying as hell to see when it's stuck and doesn't go away in Finder.\nWhat I did is I created an AppleScript file (Kill_Bird.scpt) with this following command.\ndo shell script \"killall bird\"\n\nThen I made a Voice Command to run the Kill_Bird.scpt file.  Since I always have Voice Control activated, all I have to do is speak the phrase \"Kill Bird\" and ... voila\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant cannot be used. This Mac does not support Boot Camp I have a MacBook Air and every time I try to download bootcamp it always says the same thing.'Boot Camp Assistant cannot be used. This Mac does not support Boot Camp.'  can somebody please help me?\n\nA: Is it an M1 Mac?\nOnly Intel Macs can use Boot Camp. See Apple KB - Boot Camp Support\nThere are ways to run Windows on M1 Macs, but you need Windows for ARM processors. There are many articles about this online, here's one - MacHow2 - How to run Windows on M1 Macs\n", "Q: Why are many files and folders greyed out in Finder? When I navigate in Finder (or in File Save/Open windows) I often see various files and folders are shown in grey. I can navigate them as normal, so what does this mean?\n\n\nA: Generally that means the file or folder is hidden. @Gilby accurately points out that ⌘ + ⇧ + . (Command+Shift+Period) will toggle their collective visibility on or off, though it doesn't change the hidden flag. Instead, the entries will appear as grayed out.\nIf you open a terminal window the command chflags nohidden  followed by the name of your file or folder (so, for example: chflags nohidden ./2020) will toggle its visibility back to on in finder, but you'll need to click off the folder and then return to it (or in some cases run the ⌘ + ⇧ + . twice) to get Finder to \"notice\" the change. Note that protected system files, dotfiles (files whose name begins with a \".\") and files for which you are not the owner will not be affected by this.\nEdit: It's entirely possible that some other program or process has claimed ownership of those folders. If the above doesn't work for you, please post back and we'll try to debug it.\n", "Q: View unmodified bytes of a filename on APFS How do I view the bytes of a filename as it’s stored an APFS volume (i.e. without going through Unicode normalization)?\nContext: I migrated an old iTunes library to a new Music.app library, and ran the \"Consolidate files\" operation on the result to tidy things up. Then I used rsync and diff to compare the two on disk and got results like:\n% diff -rq iTunes/iTunes\\ Music Music/Media.localized/Music\n...\nOnly in Music/Media.localized/Music: Múm\nOnly in iTunes/iTunes Music: Múm\n\nThis led me down the path of learning about Unicode normalization (explainers here and here). Those two strings have the same visual representation but are stored differently on disk. This comes up frequently with accented characters.\nThe question that arose was: How do I quickly get the on-disk byte representation of each name, so that I can be confident I understand what is going on?\nBTW, for the original problem of comparing directories, I found this handy Python script (via this answer) which will consider Unicode-equivalent names as matching.\n\nA: There has got to be a better way, but answering my own question as I at least found a way. Just copy the filename from Finder and paste it into your favorite hex dump tool.\n% xxd\nMúm\n00000000: 4dc3 ba6d 0a                             M..m.\n% xxd\nMúm\n00000000: 4d75 cc81 6d0a                           Mu..m.\n\nBe careful though: If you accidentally get into Finder's rename box, it will overwrite the on-disk byte representation with a normalized form, leaving you very confused.\nI lost a lot of time thinking that ls would print filenames as they are on disk, and I could pipe that to xxd or od, but as far as I can tell it actually normalizes before printing.\n% ls -d Music/Media.localized/Music/M?m | tail -c 5 | xxd\n00000000: 4dc3 ba6d 0a                             M..m.\n% ls -d iTunes/iTunes\\ Music/M?m | tail -c 5 | xxd\n00000000: 4dc3 ba6d 0a                             M..m.\n\nFor a pure-CLI option, there's surely something more direct, but I did find this Perl script would do the job.\n", "Q: How do I adjust the brightness on my monitor? I have a MacBook Air and it is connected to a monitor from Acer. I tried adjusting the brightness on both screens but it only changes the brightness on my MacBook.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no native way to change the brightness on the (non-Apple) monitor without using the OSD on the monitor. However, there do exist various third-party apps that can do this for you!\nI personally use Lunar, which will allow you to change the brightness/contrast on the monitor from your MacBook. Instead of changing the display output (effectively dimming each individual pixel before sending it to the monitor), it uses a feature called DDC, which is on nearly every modern monitor. This allows it to directly change the brightness and contrast, same as you would using the monitor's OSD.\nYou can map Lunar's brightness and contrast controls to function keys, so you can control the brightness from your keyboard. It also has some more advanced features like syncing the brightness to the brightness on the MacBook's display or change it based on sunrise/sunset times, but it looks like those features are now paid unfortunately.\nThere are other options out there, like MonitorControl, but I don't have any personal experience with them.\n", "Q: Incorrect SSL certification path On our site that we have clients logging into we have a SSL certificate that was issued by GoDaddy.  For some of our MAC users when they connect to our site and you look at the certification path it shows that the SSL certificate was issued by Apple.

I have downloaded the GoDaddy Root and Intermediate certificates and loaded them into the Keystore but it did not make a difference.  Odd thing is that it does not affect all MAC users, some login without any issues.  It is a Citrix NetScaler that they are connecting to and I am waiting to hear back from Citrix.\n\n\nA: Check the Root Certificate you see above named \"Apple\": It looks like manually added, showing the blue \"+\"-Sign. I doubt this certificate must be around, delete it and retry (you may save it before deleting it from your keychain, just drag it out and drop it on your Desktop; you may add it later again the same way, if you think it was an error). To delete it, open Keychain Access, search it, mark it and press the \"backspace\" key.\nI can see the following \"Apple\" Root Certificates on my machines:\n\n*\n\n*Apple Root CA\n\n*Apple Root CA - G2\n\n*Apple Root CA - G3\n\n*Apple Root Certificate Authority\n\n", "Q: APFS disk plugged in newer system gives \"Incompatible Disk\" warning in original OS If you plug an external macOS system disk using APFS into a newer version of macOS you will get a warning afterwards back in your original macOS saying: \"Incompatible Disk. This disk uses features that are not supported on this version of MacOS\"\nHow to reproduce:\nInstall mojave to an external drive. When everything runs fine shutdown. Take the disk and mount it under a system running big sur. Eject the disk. Boot mojave again from the external drive and see the above error.\nYou don't need to do anything with that disk in the newer OS, mounting and unmounting again is sufficient. It does only happen to disks containing a macOS system.\nI had that issue with several macOS combinations:\nmojave disk -> mounting under big sur -> boot back to mojave\nhigh sierra disk -> mounting under big sur -> boot back to high sierra\nFinding a solution I only read the advice to erase the whole disk and reinstall.\nCan anyone tell what APFS or container feature(s) macOS adds and if it is possible to remove that feature(s) with a tool like diskutil or similar without erasing?\n\nA: The newer versions of macOS have the root volume composed from a read-only volume and a read/write volume. The older versions of macOS have not been patched with software to correct interpret this type of configuration. Instead, these older versions have at least been patched to recognize the newer configuration exists and to display the warning message posted in the OP's question.\nI have a 2018 Mac mini with Mojave installed on the internal drive. The external Thunderbolt 3 drive has both Mojave and Big Sur installed in the same APFS container. Furthermore, internal Mojave has the home directory for each account manually set to the home directory of the corresponding account on the external Mojave volume. (The external Mojave has the home directories in the default location.) When booting the internal Mojave, the warning message is displayed. This configure has been in use since Big Sur was released and no one has noticed any problems.\nIn other words, read and writing† to a APFS volume in a APFS container with a newer version of macOS apparently does not create problems. However, you would not want to use an older version of macOS to verify or repair an APFS container with a newer version of macOS installed.\nIMO, if I was to remove Big Sur from the external drive, then I would still want to use tools from Big Sur or newer to verify or repair the APFS container which contained Big Sur. I think this would be good practice for macOS or any other operating system.\n† Here I assume the write would be to a safe location. For example, while booted to Mojave, copying a file from a Mojave users desktop to a the same users Big Sur Desktop folder.\n\nA: I should have asked for clarification if the disks were data disks or system disks. This may need a major edit or deletion…\nNot connecting older bootable drives to newer OS is a larger penalty than just not upgrading them…\n\nYour question lacks some technical details but at the highest level, Big Sur implements a snapshot of the system to sign and attest that it’s unchanged at boot. The older OS do not have code to handle that situation and will break the drive for Big Sur if you somehow bypassed that restriction. This one way transformation does not happen on any disk except for ones where you run the OS installer.\nThe solution is to not install or upgrade Big Sur on any external drive that needs to be used with older OS and as you already know - erasing the drive or using a backup is the way to go back.  Data drives can be shared in either direction, system drives only work forwards, not backwards.\nHere is a nice article showing the technical details around this process that ends up creating a cryptographically signed snapshot of the system installed files that then gets mounted when needed to boot the OS in Big Sur or newer.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/11/30/is-big-surs-system-volume-sealed/\n", "Q: Bypass Two-Factor Authentication on iPhone My iPhone is stuck on the Apple screen, and everything I've found online says to connect it to iTunes to do a software update.

After formatting, I noticed some strange behavior after doing backups. I tried to investigate the backup drive, but found no files in it, although a few hundred gigabytes were being used up. I decided to use the terminal to look at what was taking up all this space. This is what I found:\n\nSo it looked like all of my backups were appended with .interrupted, suggesting that not a single backup from all these backups had completed successfully. This is what my Time Machine preferences pane looks like:\n\nWhy are all of my backups \"interrupted?\" How do I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: Don't worry about these folders and don't try to clean them up manually. All files and data from interrupted backups are not copied again on the next backup try (provided they were not changed), Time Machine would verify and use them. And it will clean up the \".interrupted\" folders automatically after finishing the 1st successful backup.\n", "Q: Error when handling tagged files in Finder When handling files with Finder tags I frequently get an error alert, \"The operation can't be completed. An unexpected error occurred (error code -8076).\" This usually happens when I have multiple tagged items selected. Sometimes it happens a few times in quick succession, with the alert popping up again as soon as it is dismissed... & again, & again, up to 5 times.\n\nCan anyone tell me of a way to stop this happening? (apart from not using Finder tags)\n\nA: I will usually get this error, if I select items in a folder and its subfolders and try to add or remove tags.\nThe only way I found around this is to use a different option for tagging after the error appeared. For example, instead of changing tags in the preview pane on the right, use Edit Tags in the toolbar or Tags... in the context menu, use a shortcut like CTRL-0, drop the files onto a tag in the sidebar on the left or change the selected files.\nUltimately, I've built an app, that helps me with some of these issues when manually tagging files.\n", "Q: Why is sleepimage and swapfile filled with zeros? If I look at the contents of either sleepimage or swapfile in /var/vm, I find that it's just 1.07G of null bytes. I'd expect them to contain actual data, or if they're not being used to be a 0B file. I've checked a few different OS versions and verified that this is the case from 10.9 to 11.6, so I doubt it's something particular to a given setup or filesystem.\n\nA: I decided to do some digging into the kernel source and I have a rough answer, but it's still not 100% clear. If you take a look at IOHibernateIO.cpp inside the IOHibernateSystemPostWake method you see the following call (note: slightly different for 10.11+, but the same function ends up being called)\n    if (kFSOpened == gFSState)\n    {\n    // invalidate & close the image file\n    gIOHibernateCurrentHeader->signature = kIOHibernateHeaderInvalidSignature;\n    if ((fileRef = gIOHibernateFileRef))\n    {\n        gIOHibernateFileRef = 0;\n        IOSleep(TRIM_DELAY);\n        kern_close_file_for_direct_io(fileRef,\n#if DISABLE_TRIM\n                       0, 0, 0, 0, 0);\n#else\n                       0, (caddr_t) gIOHibernateCurrentHeader, \n                       sizeof(IOHibernateImageHeader),\n                       0,\n                       gIOHibernateCurrentHeader->imageSize);\n#endif\n    }\n    gFSState = kFSIdle;\n    }\n    return (kIOReturnSuccess);\n\nImportantly, DISABLE_TRIM is defined as 0, so we end up calling kern_close_file_for_direct_io whose signature is as follows:\nvoid\nkern_close_file_for_direct_io(struct kern_direct_file_io_ref_t * ref,\n                  off_t write_offset, caddr_t addr, vm_size_t write_length,\n                  off_t discard_offset, off_t discard_end)\n\nand whose implementation first seems to issue a DKIOCUNMAP ioctl for the extents belonging to the hibernate file, then copies write_length bytes from memory address addr into the file. If we look a bit back, gIOHibernateCurrentHeader is zeroed out in memory after the hibernate image is written during IOHibernateSystemSleep.\nSo this leads to a few conclusions, as well as a few lingering questions:\n\n*\n\n*This does indeed seem to be intended behavior, and I can see a similar DKIOCUNMAP being issued within vm_compressor_backing_file.c so I assume that something similar happens for swap files as well.\n\n\n*However, I'm uncertain as to what this means for the space physically taken on disk. For APFS this is trivially answerable since it supports sparse files (so even if the file is actually 1.7G of null bytes it won't matter), but what happens for HFS+? My understanding is that the DKIOCUNMAP ioctl effectively translates into the SSD TRIM command to clean up used blocks:\n\nThe doUnmap method was introduced as a replacement for the doDiscard method. It performs a similar function, which is to release disk blocks that are not used by the file system. Unlike the doDiscard method, which is capable of releasing only a single physically contiguous run of disk blocks, the doUnmap method is provided with an array containing one or more ranges of disk blocks that are no longer in use. A user space process can perform this action by sending the ioctl DKIOCUNMAP.\n\nwhich would seem to imply that despite the file-system level thinking that the size of the file is 1.7G, none of those extents actually point to valid blocks on disk, and so the physical file size is far less. This would also explain why it's 1.7G of zeros, since I assume the SSD controller upon receiving the trim command might implement RZAT (return zeros after trim). This hypothesis could be tested by trying this on a spinning disk and seeing if data is returned.\n", "Q: Preview Images Inside Folder Icons Can I insert an image or more than one image into a folder icon, (like overlaying the image onto the folder icon itself) so I can see some of the data that is in that folder before I click on it?

The rEFind boot manager is a common choice.

So once you've installed Homebrew's zsh, it will be at /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh. The zsh that ships with macOS is at /bin/zsh.\nIf you've hard-coded the path /usr/local/bin/zsh somewhere, you can use one of the following commands to make that exist:\nsudo ln -s /bin/zsh /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh /usr/local/bin\n\nYour attempt with ln didn't work because you passed the arguments to ln in the wrong order, and also because the preinstalled zsh is in /bin and not /usr/bin.\nIf you want to change your login shell, you can use the following command:\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\n\nOr chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh to change to Homebrew's zsh.\nModern macOS comes with a recent version of zsh, so there's no advantage to using the one from Homebrew.

As per previous answers on this topic, I had installed the QLMarkdown plugin in my /Library/Quicklook to make this happen, and it was working fine for a while.\nRecently I had a hardware disaster that required Apple to wipe and replace my hard drive, with the new one running Monterey. In this new system, the QLMarkdown plugin is not working. I tried copying the latest version (1.3.6) into the /Library/Quicklook and, as per the readme, I ran qlmanage -r in the terminal to refresh. Then I got an error from Apple saying it would not run because Apple could not check it for malicious software. No option to override.\nThe previous answers suggest I could install Homebrew and run \"brew cask install qlmarkdown\", but following the Homebrew install instructions wound up causing a system freeze and reboot - and QuickLook wasn't working any better after that.\nHow do I get QuickLook to recognize Markdown on Monterey under these circumstances?\n\nA: Short answer\nIf you've (recently) done brew install --cask qlmarkdown, you probably just need to run QLMarkdown.app to activate the plugin.\nIf you can't/don't use homebrew, make sure you're using this version of qlmarkdown: sbarex/QLMarkdown — and follow the instructions there.\nLong answer\nFor a long time, the QLMarkdown plugin was this one: toland/qlmarkdown, and that's what you'd get even if you installed it from homebrew.  That version basically consists of a  \"qlmarkdown.qlgenerator\" file which needs to be copied to some particular folder — as described in the question above.\nUnfortunately, that project has been abandoned.\nThe good news is that it's been replaced with sbarex/QLMarkdown, which I can report works great under Monterey.  In fact, if you do a brew cask --install qlmarkdown today, this is the version you get — which is very helpful!\nBut this new project works slightly differently: instead of installing a \"qlmarkdown.qlgenerator\" file somewhere, the plugin is delivered as an app (QLMarkdown.app) which you need to run before the extension is available.\n(You may also need to enable the extension in System Preferences > Extensions > Quick Look.)\nIf you've run brew install --cask qlmarkdown relatively recently, you've probably got this updated version, so the solution is probably just \"run the app\". (BTW you might also want to pass --no-quarantine to brew install so it skips that tediousness, assuming you trust the cask of course )\n(BTW I've seen some chatter suggesting that \"*.qlgenerator\" is deprecated as a way of installing QuickLook plugins since Catalina, but I can't find confirmation of it, and AFAICS some plugins in that style still work, e.g. qlvideo. ‍♂️ )\n", "Q: Applescript: \"can't get tab group 1 of window \"System Preferences\" I tried to run the script using Automator from this question:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"keyboardTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\" to tell window 1\n    click checkbox \"Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" of tab group 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nIt works only when the checkbox in System Preferences is enabled, else (checkbox is disabled) I get the error:\nThe action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error: “System Events got an error: Can’t get tab group 1 of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\".

Turns out the format matters.\nI did some digging around, and it seems that most people recommend ExFAT for cross-platform external drives. However, after reading this thread and running the Blackmagicdesign Disk Speed Test on both formats (APFS is ~130MB/s faster), it seems that APFS has more benefits if I want to just use this drive with my Macbook Pro, which will probably be the case.\nI am thinking that the best strategy is to partition my SSD into one half for ExFAT and then the other for APFS. So, I would write a portion of my PC files into the ExFAT partition, copy it into my Macbook, then copy it back into the APFS partition. Once I've done this will all my PC files, I would delete the ExFAT partition. Would this work?\nAlso, when would I want case-sensitivity? When would I want encryption (I know security but it seems that no one really does it)? If I do encryption, can I edit files directly on the SSD?\nOr should I just ditch all this and use the Windows Migration Assistant to transfer my files, format all of my SSD for APFS, and then copy the files onto my SSD?\n\nA: I would certainly recommend encryption if you are using the disk anywhere outside of a secure place at home. Apple drive encryption will simply ask you for a one-time password for each encrypted partition when you connect/mount it. If you wish you can store it in your keychain.\nUnless you need very very fast read/write or have a slow machine, encryption is certainly worth it to protect your files.\nIt sounds like you have plenty of options for getting all the files into one volume. I tend to use exfat for compatibility between Linux/windows/Mac but if you foresee only Mac use from now on, might be worth going for APFS as you say.\nFor transferring your files you could:\n\n*\n\n*use migration assistant - very user friendly\n\n\n*transfer over a private wired or WiFi network using windows file sharing - also simple and maybe neater for those more tech-minded.\nOn win: (enable in control panel>printer and file sharing)\nOn mac: open network tab in finder and windows        computer should appear\n\n\n*split disk partitions - great if you don’t have the right cables for the other stuff (and potentially as fast depending on USB and Ethernet standards you have on the 2 machines)\nIf you do make a split partition to transfer you can simply resize your APFS using diskutil via the terminal. The command: mergepartitions will keep the first partition and then extend it into and overwrite any remaining partitions, see documentation here: https://www.dssw.co.uk/reference/diskutil.html\nThis way you don’t need to format the whole disk to then back everything up again on the SSD.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Is there any gyroscope, accelerometer & magnetometer sensor built in for modern Macs? Is there any gyroscope, accelerometer & magnetometer sensor built in for modern Macs?\nWe know all modern smartphones contain these sensors. I wonder if modern Macs contains any such sensors built-in into them or not.\n\nA: iMacs don't have any those.\nMacBooks have accelerometer called SMS - Sudden Motion Sensor to protect hard drives when MacBook gets dropped. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Motion_Sensor\niPhones/iPads have all of those.\nCustom sensors (old information): https://logi.wiki/index.php/SMC_Sensor_Codes\n", "Q: \"Find Windows\" Shortcuts action hanging for a long time? I'm trying to create a macOS shortcut (with the Shortcuts app) that opens a URL with Safari and then resizes the window. I'm finding that the shortcut hangs on \"Find Windows\" action for a good 13 seconds every time before moving onto the next action (Resize Window).\nI've tried plenty of different settings for the Find Windows action, and they all seem to yield the same result. Has anyone else noticed this behavior or know why this is happening?\n\nA: According to this tweet, the \"Find Windows\" action hanging for extended periods of time is a known bug that will be fixed in macOS Monterey 12.2.\n", "Q: 2020 M1 Macbook Pro won't drive ultrawide monitor unless it's charging Here's a weird one. 2020 M1 Macbook Pro, running Big Sur 11.6.2.\nI've just got a new monitor - Samsung Odyssey G5 34\", 21:9 resolution (3440x1440). I have a Hyper Drive Pro Hub (8-in-2) plugged into the macbook, and into that is a USB A cable for my devices (keyboard, mouse dongle, camera and USB soundcard), then a Yubikey plugged into a USB-C port, then the power, and finally an HDMI cable to the monitor.\nThe monitor is set to 60Hz.\nWhen I first plug the dock in in the morning, the monitor doesn't always work - just shows black. If I change the resolution down to 1920x1080@50Hz it then does work. Just now, I wondered if it was a power issue, so clicked the battery icon in the toolbar which said \"holding at 85%, will charge to full...\" - so it's using optimized charging.\nWhen I then clicked the 'charge to full now' button, the screen would let me go up to full resolution.\nWhat's going on here? My guess is something to do with bandwidth and power delivery, but I've no clue what.\nI have also ordered another dock by a different manufacturer, so I'll see if that is any different.\nUpdate: the new dock (an Anker one) is working fine, so my guess is it's to do with USB/thunderbolt bandwidth and power. Still weird though.\n\nA: Not all hubs are created equal and some cannot cater for the energy needs of all the peripherals AND the laptop. Some hubs are PD 60W only and that might not suffice.\nExample: 30W adapter for MB Air can charge the laptop without issues. I can connect a Lenovo M14 USB-C screen to it - charging still works but is considerably slower. Now, the Lenovo screen also does PD, but when the chain is adapter->Screen-Air, the charging is ultraslow to 'negative' depending on the tasks running. A power adapter from an Intel MB Pro (80 something W) has no issue.\nAnother thing... HDMI - depending on the cable, it might not deliver the required resolution (at all times).\n\nA: Monterey 12.0-12.1 has serious problems with USB-C power delivery. I've heard that 12.2 fixes them, but I did not install the beta to confirm it\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/monterey-usb-hub-issues-reported/\n", "Q: How to get Dell 1320c working on iMac with 10.15 Catalina? I'm hoping somebody could direct me to a solution for my printer problem.  I just switched to an iMac after being a lifelong PC user and love the hardware and software on the iMac but can't get my printer going.\nI have followed the links in similar questions but Xerox has ended support for the Docuprint C525a printer.  Their support site sends you to a page to discuss a new printer, which people say has similar drivers to the Dell 1320c so I wondered if somebody could help with a working link for those drivers.\n\nA: Well, I have found a workaround to get the printer working without a second pc to turn it into a network printer... Installed Windows 10 on the iMac using Bootcamp, took a couple of hours but can at least use the printer.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this printer is very unlikely to be compatible with Catalina.\nLooking at the OpenPrinting website for supported Xerox printers, the Docuprint C525a printer isn't listed.  In fact, the entire C5 line is nowhere to be found. There's even less listed for Dell and the only printer in the 13** series is tagged as \"mostly working.\"\nIt's important to note that OpenPrinting provides the CUPS filters and PPDs that are used on Unix/Linux operating systems.  CUPS is the Common Unix Printing System (standards based, open source) developed by Apple.\nIt's not likely a standalone network print server will solve your issue here as the print server doesn't magically have every driver for every printer.  In fact, it just acts as a \"pass through\" - your computer will still need the printer drivers to print to it.\nIf you must use this printer, instead of using Bootcamp, use a VM through VirtualBox (free).  This allows you to spin up the Windows machine with the correct drivers without having to shutdown macOS and boot Windows.  Once you're done, you just close the VM and continue on.\n", "Q: Disk Utility multiple runs shows same warning message and is not actually repairing the disk Disk Utility log:\nRunning First Aid on

The computer searches for Time Machine backups for a bit, then tells me there are none to be found. Is there a magic flag on the disk image or something similar that will force MacOS to restore the backup?\n\nA: The general answer to your question is to follow the standard restore procedure, using Migration Assistant. This worked for me, restoring from an M1 backup to an Intel MacBook Pro running a newer version of MacOS (Ventura) than the backup (Monterey).\nI'm not sure what the problem was in your specific case, but the symptom suggests a problem connecting to, mounting or reading your backup device.\n", "Q: Install custom Windows 10 iso via Boot Camp I am running a non-retina 15' 2012 Macbook Pro with Mojave 1.14.4. I had some apps for work that I can only run on Windows but I am not willing to download the full Windows 10 with all the bloatwares that it has. So I found some reputable custom Windows 10 Lite iso files in hope of having a lighter version of Windows I could use without worrying about Windows update or all its bloatware. Though, Boot Camp Assistant rejected installing the file with this popup:\n\nThe iso I'm trying to install is a 64bit iso as well and with some digging, I found that Boot Camp only allows installation of official Windows 10 iso files downloaded straight from Microsoft.\nIs there a way I could bypass this pop-up altogether and proceed with my installation? Or if there are any Windows 10 iso that works will be great. Worst case scenario I guess I will have to install the full Windows 10 iso. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Boot Camp will not let you install any Windows ISO that isn't directly downloaded from Microsoft. It is quite annoying, I know.\nSo you need to use Bootcamp just to download all the Drivers and other files, which Boot camp does allow.\nThen you will have to make your own Bootable USB/DVD and partition your drive and then install Windows Lite.\n", "Q: For what versions of iPhone and iPad is the Battery Health available?

And then I did the following to repartition the HDD on a Windows machine using the Disk Management tool:\n\n*\n\n*I backed up and then deleted the 750GB volume\n\n*I then created a new 500GB simple volume from the available unallocated space (750GB). I then transferred files to this volume. This left 250GB of unallocated space.\n\n*I then deleted the 250GB 2nd partition. When I did this, it combined this 250GB unallocated space with the 250GB unallocated space created in step 2.\n\n*I then created a new simple volume with 500GB of unallocated space.\n\nSo in the end, I took 2 partitioned spaces (750GB, 250GB) and repartitioned them to create two equal partitioned spaces (500GB) each.\nWindows recognized this new partition map perfectly and could see the new files that I had transferred to one of the 500GB volumes (step 2).\nWhen I plugged this HDD into my macOS (Catalina 10.15.7), it bizarrely recognized the old partitions (750GB, 250GB) and even let me access files from the 250GB partition that I had deleted in the process. I quickly plugged it into my Windows machine and it showed the new partitions.\nWhy is my Mac showing the old partitions and how is it still allowing me access to the files I deleted? Is the partition map corrupt or is my Mac reading it incorrectly somehow? How do I fix this?\nI need to transfer files from my Mac onto one of the new partitions that I created but since my Mac isn't showing me these new partitions (just the old ones), I don't know what to do.\n\nA: Your drive is probably using hybrid partitioning. This is where three tables containing the partition location information are stored on the drive. One table is stored in the first sector of the drive. The second is stored near the start of the drive and third is stored near the end of the drive. The second and third are identical (although the corresponding headers are not.) When a disk is hybrid partitioned, macOS recognizes all three tables, but only uses the data stored in the second and third tables to determine the partition location information. However, Windows only uses the first table to determine the partition location information and ignores the second and third tables.\nUnder hybrid partition, the possibility exists where Windows could be used to reparation the drive where only the first table would be updated with the changes. The macOS operation system would then possibly read outdated or corrupted information from the second and third tables.\n", "Q: Best port to connect Macbook Pro's USB C port to external monitor What's the preferred external monitor port to connect a Macbook Pro with USB C ports only (a 2019 Macbook 16) if the monitor doesn't have USB C ports?\nI read that USB C natively carries data in DisplayPort format so I'm wondering if that is the preferred port and whether using HDMI might involve some extra strain (and heat) on the Macbook. If yes, I would use a USB C to DisplayPort cable.\n\nA: I would recommend using a USB-C to DisplayPort or USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort (depending on what ports are available on your monitor).\nHowever, if you happen to have a USB-C to HDMI cable lying around, you can plug that in an check if it works for you. If it does work, there's no additional heat generated in the MacBook Pro or \"strain\" on the hardware.\n", "Q: Does TestFlight delete app data after you close the app on your phone? I have a small app that accepts user signups (name, email, phone, etc.), and I have logic to store a user ID on their device, after the signup process stores their data in Firebase. The ID allows the user to bypass the sign up process if they close the app and reopen it.\nIn Expo Go, the logic works as intended; a new user is transitioned from the splash screen to the signup screen if they've never signed up before. And if they've signed up before, the app will check for the stored user ID, and they're sent to a different screen.\nIn TestFlight, the user is always sent to the signup screen even if they've already signed up. This is my first time using TestFlight, so I'm wondering if TestFlight deletes that kind of stored data once a user closes the app. I've tried a couple different ways of writing the code, and I've been trying to find any official information on TestFlight around this scenario, but I haven't had any luck.\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You haven't actually specified what kind of storage, you're using for your data - which makes the question very ambigious.\nHowever, the answer in any case to your question is: no. TestFlight does not delete the stored data when the user closes the app.\nYou must probably have chosen an incorrect manner of storing the user data. The recommended way to store data necessary for user login is to store it in the Keychain on the phone.

I have a requirement to copy a dylib file to /usr/lib folder. Even though I have disabled csruitl in recovery mode to bypass the SIP. Still I cannot copy this file to the /usr/lib folder. I have also tried sudo cp libstdc+.dylib /usr/lib/, but no luck.\nFrom some other articles I have read - unable to copy to /usr/lib - I am suggested to copy the dylib file to /usr/local/lib with the install_name_tool.\nIf my target location is /usr/lib, the file is libstdc+.dylib, and if i put my file into the suggested location /usr/local/lib, then what should my command be in Terminal?\nOr is there any easier way to do this? Would anyone please help?\n\nA: So, this won’t be easy if you’re not able to modify the package build to look in /usr/local/lib.\nPasting the files in the new location is trivial but won’t fix the root problem of needing to modify the path for the code to understand it can’t simply reuse a system protected location.\nI would go back and look at changing your requirements now that you’ve learned the protected nature of the sealed system on macOS.\n\nA: The command in the Terminal would look like this:\ninstall_name_tool -change BEFORE AFTER MYPROGRAM\n\nThis updates the information inside the MYPROGRAM file from searching for the dylib as BEFORE to searching for it as AFTER.\nSo for example if your program is ~/office/mytool and it was previously set to load /usr/lib/libstdc++.dylib and you've now placed that file in ~/office/libstdc++.dylib instead, the command would look like this:\ninstall_name_tool -change /usr/lib/libstdc++.dylib ~/office/libstdc++.dylib ~/office/mytool\n\nNote that instead of hard-coding the paths, you can use various identifiers such as @executable_path to refer to dynamic paths.\nAlso note that it might not be immediately obvious what the program was setup to look for exactly. I would advise starting by getting that information from the program by running:\notool -L ~/office/mytool\n\nIn addition you should know that instead of manipulating the program binary itself, it is sometimes easier to set the new load path using an environment variable. I.e. instead of running your program like this:\n./mytool\n\nthen run it like this:\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./mytool\n\n", "Q: How to display menu bar in Macbook pro 14 inch in full screen?

Cron should now appear in the list.\n\n\n*Get out of system preferences window and open Finder sbin window once you finished.\nThere are security measures introduced with the release of new Mac OS, and causes issues like operation not permitted.\n\n", "Q: Whether this wireless charging speed for iPhone is 7.5W or not? iPhone SE 2, iOS 15.2, MagSafe wireless charger\nFrom 11% to 31%: 1.21% per minute.\nFrom 43% to 64%: 1.03% per minute.\nFrom 63% to 68%: 0.87% per minute.\nDo you think the speed is 7.5W or at least faster than 5W?\n\nA: Are you charging from empty? Or at least from 50%?\nThe reason I ask is that over 50% charged phones (really all lithium batteries) eventually slow down charging by design. And a phone that is too warm will usually decrease the charging speed as well. This is why fast charging advertisements all mention the time from 0% to 50% or 80%.\nIn your iPhone 12 example, it reached 15W charging at 50% full. In your iPhone SE example, it reached 5W at 89% full. The first example is an excerpt and doesn't list the current battery level.\nIn my phone (iPhone 12), placing my 90% charged phone on 15W wireless charging starts the charging sequence at 15W, but it quickly falls to 5W. Connecting the same phone to wired charging at 20W shows it only wants 15W.\nI assume if you retried you SE at about 50% capacity you should get your expected 7.5W of charging.\nEdit:\nFor maximum clarity, you can purchase a USB power meter which will show the actual power draw. But you can also look up various charger statistics.\nFor the Apple 5W charger (from phonearena.com)\n\n*\n\n*in 15 minutes: 14%\n\n*30 minutes: 28%\n\n*45 minutes: 43%\n\n*1 hour: 57%\n\n*1 hour and 15 minutes: 70%\n\n*1 hour and 30 minutes: 81%\n\n*2 hours and 30 minutes: FULL Charge\n\nIf your wireless charger is faster than this, then it can charge at 7.5W.\n\nA: \nDo you think the speed is 7.5W or at least faster than 5W?\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a watt (W) is in an electrical context.  A watt is a unit of power.  For current flow, a watt is equal to 1 volt multiplied by 1 ampre.\nIf a power adapter is rated at 7.5 watts, that doesn’t mean it will push 7.5W to a device; it means the device can draw up to 7.5W from the source.\nWith respect to the charging times and percentages, you simply cannot calculate wattage based on how much charge your battery has at particular time intervals.  Why?\n\n*\n\n*The initial charge level of the battery is unknown (what you see on your screen is a calculation based on spot measurements)\n\n*The battery age, cycle count, and current amp hours (AH) is unknown\n\n*The battery and cell efficacy is unknown\n\n*The battery chemistry and SEI layer is unknown\n\n*The power adapter specifications are unknown (yes, I know you’re trying to calculate this)\n\n*The device (iPhone) does spot measurements of battery voltage and calculates the percentage from known values.  It cannot sense if a battery cell is faulty or working at optimum capacity.\n\nTo calculate wattage, you need to measure both voltage and amperage.  Voltage is easy, using a multimeter, we can easily measure the output voltage of an adapter (we also know this from the USB specification:  5V).  The amperage likewise must be measured, but the circuit must be under load.  In other words, you can’t measure this without the device actually drawing current from the source.\nThe MagSafe wireless charger can deliver up to 15W of power.  To see how much power is being drawn you can use a USB-C Power Meter while the phone is charging and record those measurements at defined intervals.\nOnce you have this information, you can calculate the watt-hours your device is charging; the speed at which your charger is currently working.\n", "Q: Bootcamp: when initializing Windows 10 after successful Bootcamp install, there is no network I am trying to get Windows 10 working in Bootcamp under Big Sur. I have a MacBook Pro, retina, mid-2014 device,\nI followed all the steps, including the installation of the Windows support software. After a long process, my device can now boot either in Windows or MacOS.\nHowever (!!!) ...\n... when first booting into Windows 10, the Windows 10 installation/startup code is run. Part way through that, it tries to go to the network, and it can't find the network. Therefore, the Windows 10 initialization fails and cannot complete, and so I have never been able to actually start up Windows 10. This means that I can't follow the instructions that I have found on line about how to correct network problems after starting Windows via bootcamp.\nI have no trouble accessing the network when running on the same machine under MacOS.\nHow can I get my bootcamp-based Windows 10 to see the network, so its initialization can complete?\nThank you very much in advance.\nPS: To be clear, after first booting into Windows 10, I am prompted for things like what country I'm in, what language I am using, what keyboard I want to use, etc. Then, the software continues with the Windows initialization process and eventually gets to a black screen upon which a message comes out saying that there is no network, and that it cannot continue. No option to correct this is offered, and there is nothing I can click on or enter, and my machine is essentially frozen. My only option at that point is to reboot into MacOS.\nThis is what I mean when I say that I can boot into Windows 10, but that the initialization of that OS fails due to the inability to access the network.\n\nA: If the above answer doesn't work for you, you could click the tab on the left of the window that first says about the unidentified network which says \"continue with limited setup\". I did this yesterday when doing my own setup and eventually, once Windows is installed and you have entered your username, etc. Bootcamp then installed drivers for the network adaptors amongst other things. Wish I had taken screenshots of the process now.\n\nA: You can create \"an already running Window instance\" before you reach the point where you are having network problems. When you reach the screen shown below, enter the key combination control+shift+F3. You will enter Audit mode, which can take some time to complete on older Macs.\n\nYou should eventually see a desktop similar to what is shown below.\n\nYou now can configure your Windows installation, which can include installing Boot Camp and other Windows software provided by Apple. The installer provided by Apple may appear automatically or manually executed by running the Setup application in the BootCamp folder on the flash drive. Below is an example of the application. Your version may be different.\n\nWhen you wish to leave Audit mode and finish the Windows installation, set System Preparation Tool as shown below, then select the OK button. The \"Window instance\" is removed, but your changes will remain.\n\n\nNote: The System Preparation Tool can be found at C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\sysprep, which is shown below.\n\n\n", "Q: External bluetooth keyboard and mouse not detected at login screen after reboot I have a Macbook Pro 15 2018 and Logitech Mx Keys and Mx Master 3 (bluetooth keyboard and mouse) and they are working great.\nHowever when I reboot my mac and get to login screen they are not detected/connected.\nWhen I open the lid and login using the built in keyboard they start working again.\nI've found that this my be linked to FileVault and yes I am using FileVault.\nMy question:\nIs there any way to prevent this from happening without turning FileVault off ?\nWhen I put mac to sleep they still keep working and I can wake my mac by pressing a key on the keyboard.\n\nA: It is linked to FileVault in that Bluetooth pairings are stored per user, not per machine. So until you login (and thus unlock your account) the machine cannot re-pair to your devices. Keyboard backlight settings are also stored per user for some reason, so no backlight until you login. Since sleep doesn't log you out, everything still works.\nA related issue is that Bluetooth keyboards also don't work during boot up (never did for me). So if you ever need to go into recovery mode, you need a USB keyboard if the internal one breaks. I don't know how the Apple wireless keyboard bypasses all this, but I assume they cheat and use an unofficial extension to Bluetooth.\nIf you pair to the Logitech dongle, it will all work as it is essentially a \"USB\" device. If opening the lid every time is annoying, your only recourse seems to pair to the dongle as well as Bluetooth and plug in the dongle to login (and switching the 1/2/3 selector) which sounds almost as bad.\nHope any of this helped.\n\nA: This issue has been resolved for me on Monterey 12.3 Beta - multiple non-apple bluetooth devices now work during pre-boot at the FileVault prompt. So hopefully will make it into the next production release soon.\nSurprisingly to me I reported this to Apple (while sitll on 12.2) a few months ago and they got a whole bunch of diagnostic logs and info from me. While they didn't tell me they resolved it, this issue has existed for many years to seems like it managed to get someones attention.\n\nA: One key thing to note: pairing your Logitech keyboard to the USB dongle actually requires installing the \"Unifying\" software from Logitech (https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297913-Unifying-Software-). Once I installed the Unifying software, I was able to pair my Logitech bluetooth keyboard to the dongle. Now when I boot up, my keyboard works.\n@Jerzy Kiler: The Unifying software was on my Mac mini.\n", "Q: Samba/Monterey: Cannot open files inside folder after rename Symptom: I mount a SMB share via finder, rename a folder and after that i cannot open any files inside this folder anymore. there's no error message, just nothing happens after double-clicking on file.

These volumes can appear separately or as combined. When using the Finder, you viewed as combined. From the Terminal, you accessed just the read‑write volume. So while the command below would work by accessing the read‑only volume, using the -a option would not require knowing where the application resides.\nopen /System/Applications/Messages.app\n\n \n\nA: Starting in Catalina (10.15), macOS uses a split-volume format, with the system software on a locked volume and a separate \"Data\" volume for user data, user-installed software, etc. Most folders contain just one of these things, so they reside on just one volume, but the Applications folder has both, so it's handled... strangely.\nWhat's really going on is that there are two Applications folders. The built-in system applications are in /System/Applications (which is on the read-only system volume), and user-installed apps (including Safari, 'cause it's weird) are in /Applications (which is actually a firmlink to /System/Volumes/Data/Applications on the Data volume).\nNet result: at the command line, you have to look in two different places, /Applications and /System/Applications, to see all of the apps installed on your Mac.\nThe Finder shows their contents merged together, but this is just a convenient illusion -- the reality is that there are two different folders, and at the command line you see that reality.\nHere are a couple of good articles at the Eclectic Light Company about this: \"macOS Catalina Boot Volume Layout\" and \"Big Sur boot volume layout\".\n", "Q: Why isn't brew symbolically linking lld into /usr/local/bin when it installs llvm?

I then checked if maybe there was a problem with the connection on my laptop, but other browsers seem to work fine. And what's even more strange is that in school I can use all those features just fine, but once I get home and connect to my home router, they just stop working. It's as though only the apple applications that require an internet connection don't work.\nOne thing that does happen though is in Safari when I Google search from the address bar, it doesn't load instantly, but after a long while when I chance upon Safari again, the webpage has partially loaded. This only happens with Safari. The other apps don't work at all. App Store, Apple Music, updates, doesn't work at all.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem that you have, is your IP address is setup on manual for your home Wifi or something like that ?\nBecause for me the solution was that the IP address of my home Wifi were configured on manual on the network settings of the Mac (something that I did for some reasons) and once I switched to DHCP, everything worked fine again.\n", "Q: iPhone 5c unsupported upgrade possible?

The latest version of iOS supported by iPhone 5c is iOS 10.3.3. So it's not possible to upgrade it to a later version of iOS.\nEven for iOS version 10.3.3 or earlier, you should use the IPSW file build for your specific model of iOS device/iPhone.\n", "Q: How to cleanup \"Library/Containers/com.docker.docker\" on a Mac? I have an MacBook Air (10.14.6) and the folder ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/ contains 64 GB of data!!\nHow to clean up this folder?\n\nA: I doubt the folder is 64 GB. That’s a very round number, the sort one might select as the disk size in Docker Desktop preferences.\nGiven 64 GB is set as the maximum size of the disk, Finder will show the size as this. Get Info and check the size on disk instead.\n\nTo get a breakdown and accurate sizes, run docker system df.\nDocker can cope with files being deleted in this folder as long as it’s not running, but data will be lost. However the more standard way to free space is to docker system prune. See --help for usage.\nFor more information about how Docker Desktop stores data on disk, see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/space/.\n", "Q: Why does `Finder` give me the incorrect size information of a folder?

Does this folder use 64GB, or just under 3GB?\nIn addition, there is a file com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/data//Docker.raw for which ls tells me that file has a size of 64 GB (i.e. 63999836160 bytes). But the whole folder (according to du) occupies less than 3 GB. How can that be?\n\nA: This is because Docker uses sparse files.\nFinder is reporting the apparent size of the sparse file. Get Info shows the occupied size on disk.\n\n", "Q: How do I save a black & white picture to a 1-bit image file? I need a 1-bit image file to print on a laser engraver.\nI used to have quite a few graphics applications that could save 1-bit black & white TIFF files. I've owned Macs since 1987. However most of my old apps won't run on current MacOS versions and I just discovered that my current graphics apps (Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Acorn, Pixelmator, Pixelmator Pro) won't save 1-bit files. 8-bit grayscale is as close as they get.\nI have no problem editing an image so that it only contains black or white pixels. Pixelmator Pro's Format: Effects: Halftone: Dot Screen or Line Screen effects are great for what I want. It's the underlying file format that I'm having problems getting to with modern software.\nI have a workaround. I can save an 8-bit TIFF to a USB thumb drive and open it in Microsoft Paint on the Windows PC attached to the laser cutter and save it as a 1-bit BMP or TIFF file for the laser cutter's software. However the grey haired Mac nerd in me is offended that Windows still has a feature that seems to have vanished from current Mac systems.\nDoes anyone have suggestions for an app to convert grayscale images to 1-bit TIFF files?\n\nA: On macOS you can use GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to create 1-bit TIFF files.\nWith the image opened, go to Image > Mode > Indexed > (•) Use black and white (1-bit) palette > Convert\nThen File > Export As… > filename.tiff > Export.\n\nGIMP is a free and open source image editor.\n\nA: You can use ImageMagick commandline tool for that. If your image is already Black and White you simply do:\nconvert input_file.tif -depth 1 output_file.tif\n\nIf you have to make the file B/W just add -separate -black-threshold 128 (you can adjust the threshold for your needs).\nHere's the exiftool output for my sample file:\n\nBits Per Sample                 : 1\n\n", "Q: How to Time Machine Backup with Mac OS Extended Journaled instead of APFS I had two SSD's - when I tried to use them for time machine backups, they were automatically formatted as APFS without giving me an option to select Mac OS Extended Journaled.\nThe problem is, there is some kind of bug in Big Sur, where randomly after a few backups there is an error during the \"Preparing Backup\" stage, where it just says there was an error (no detailed information). This has been heavily documented on Apple forums.\nI have found that there is nothing wrong with the drives, and they work fine when formatted as Mac OS Extended Journaled. But Big Sur does not give me the option to create my time machine drive with HFS+. It automatically chooses APFS, and reformats my drive to APFS if I format it to HFS+ first!!\nAt first I thought this was just for SSD's, but now I find it is doing the same when I try to backup to an ordinary HDD.\nHow can I prevent this from happening? This seems to be some bug in Big Sur Time Machine backups. I cannot update to Monterrey because I have an old Mac which does not support further updates.\n\nA: *\n\n*First find a machine running an earlier version of Mac OS prior to Big Sur.\n\n*Format your SSD for HFS+ (Mac OS Extended etc)....\n\n*Create time machine backup of this earlier OS.\n\n*Then take the same drive to your Big Sur or later machine, and use the same drive to backup. This time, Time Machine will not wipe / format your drive as APFS because it will detect that there already is a Time Machine backup stored on the drive. As an added bonus, you can use the drive to store other files on it as well!\n\nEDIT: Here is where its mentioned: https://support.apple.com/sq-al/guide/mac-help/mh15139/11.0/mac/11.0\nThe key thing is, the drive should already contain a time machine backup. If it does, then Time Machine won't wipe it / format to APFS, and will just continue with the previous format (Mac OS Extended)\n\nA: In addition to Kaizer Sozay's answer:\nyou do not have to make a backup on another machine. It's enough to put the following folders on the drive after formatting it with HFS+ (Mac OS Extended Journaled):\nBackups.backupdb\n|__ SomeMachineName\n|__ 2022-07-30-060606\nIt's best to create this three nested directories/folders on your desktop first and copy it to your HFS+ TimeMachine drive in one go, because if you create a folder called Backups.backupdb on the root level of a drive, your Mac won't let you copy anything to or create in that folder.\nThese three folders are all it takes to convince Monterey that your drive is a valid TimeMachine volume and it will not reformat it with APFS when you add it to TimeMachine BigSur or Monterey.\nIMHO it only makes sense to go through this effort for a spinning harddisk. If you use an SSD for TimeMachine, APFS is indeed the better choice.\n", "Q: An error occurred while loading the update So yesterday I tried to update my iMac 2017 to the Monterey version, but I received this message\n\"An error occurred while loading the update\"\n\nps: image from internet\n\nAny ideas on how i can fix that without losing my data ?\n\nA: Have you tried the Recovery feature?  I had an similar issue with one of my updates and reinstalled the system using macOS Recovery.  Since, thanks to APFS, the system is in its own partition it is a little safer to do this than in the past.  As an added future precaution I have moved all my really important data to an external drive (as well as having a Time Machine backup)\n", "Q: Google Chrome toolbar space problem \nWhen I'm opening a new window in google chrome then chrome is taking a huge empty space below the apple menu bar.\n\nA: This is a bug: Issue 1264148: Empty space above tab bar in Monterey with Menu bar when \"Automatically show and hide the menu bar in full screen\" is disabled.\nThere is this a Reddit thread that suggests a workaround: Huge gap at the top when Chrome is in fullscreen\n\n*\n\n*Solution 1:\nfull screen chrome --> gap shows up --> three finger swipe up --> three finger swipe down --> gap disappears.\n\n\n*Solution 2:\nFound temporary fix System Preferences --> Dock & Menu Bar --> Make sure \"Automatic Hide and Show Menu Bar on Fullscreen\" is checked\n\nA: Not sure that it won't come back (I am new to Macbook). After trying my new Air M1 for a day (I did experience the space glitch), I wiped it thinking that I would resell. I am a Chromebook person, and actually just figured out that I could do video editing on my Smartphone (only reason Chromebook was being difficult).\nThen I realized I'd gotten through the Mac OS learning curve pretty quick (e.g. Android File Transfer, as I shot video with Pixel 6 Pro [aside-Pixel 6 Pro cannot transfer files to Pixelbook Go via data cable; What!]).\nShort story long, I fired the Macbook back up, installed Chrome for Mac, and did not select 'share stats with Google' or 'make Chrome my Primary Browser' (meaningless as it is in the dock and you just use it...).

I don't know if Spotlight still stores the indexing files there in Monterey (The folder isn't on the system drive either, where search is working fine).\nSo, is Monterey having an issue there? The exact same setup was working fine on another MBP and another OS version.\nDid anybody succeed in indexing external drives on Monterey?\nI tried turning indexing off and on again with sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/Drive_to_index and sudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/Drive_to_index, rebuilding the index with a sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/Drive_to_index but no changes.\n\nEdit:\nFollowing Rory's answer, there is no hidden .metadata_never_index_unless_rootfs file on any of my external hard drives.\n\nA: I had your same problem and nothing helped.\nBut as mentioned in this answer, you can fix by disabling & re-enabling the indexing via shell, with:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nCPU use should go up, showing the mds and mds_stores processes being busy indexing the drive; there will be also an Indexing.. progress bar inside Spotlight.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I tried the exact same commands last week (confirmed by history | grep mdutil), and it didn't really fix anything.\nToday instead it works. ‍♂️\n\n\nA: So after weeks of not being able to access my sample library and music files on my external drive post-Monterey update, I was feeling very discouraged, especially after searching this forum and the web to no avail for a solution to the indexing and spotlight issue with the current OS. Today I am pleased to say I have found a solution that works and I am currently watching the light on my Glyph studio raid flicker as Spotlight scours the files on said HD.\nFirst, go into Finder and press Shift+Cmd+. (yes that is a period)\nThis will allow you to see the hidden files on your external drive\nSearch for a file named like the one below\n.metadata_never_index_unless_rootfs\ndelete the file in Finder, then eject the drive. Then re-mount the drive and run this in Terminal:\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\nOnce that is done your external drive should begin indexing and you should be able to use spotlight to locate files on your ext HD.\nI hope this helps, I have been trying to fix this for over a month now.\n\nA: After struggling with Spotlight Search on SMB shares for a long time, I have settled with GoToFile for searching files. It builds its own index and just finds everything without problems. Finda is also good at finding files when spotlight fails.\n", "Q: Best Practice for storing MacOS iPhotos Context:\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina / Big Sur is used to store iPhone photos\n\n*Photos are not to be stored in the cloud / iCloud\n\n*Mac has a small SSD compared to the amount of iPhone photos that are to be stored\n\nIt is not an option to replace the MacOS SSD.\nGiven the above constraints: Is best practice to format a USB memory device and somehow mount and point iPhotos to the USB storage instead of the SSD? or is there a better process?\n\nA: Many people put their entire home folder on a drive that’s not the SSD / primary internal drive since the IO speed needed to access these files is rarely as sensitive as the OS itself. I don’t know about best practice, but first moving the photo library to another drive is an excellent start if you intend to have more library storage than the boot drive can accommodate.

I decided to reinstall MacOS.\nI shut down the computer, held down Command + R, and selected Reinstall MacOS. The process was going fine, but then I was hit by a blank error, and I was prompted to select a volume to reinstall to.

How can I get my disk space back?\nI tried this but I get error -69519 what can I do?\n\n\nA: The OSXRESERVED partition (disk0s3) is created by the Boot Camp Assistant to hold the files needed to install Windows. The partition is suppose to be deleted during the installation of Windows. If Windows has completed installation and working correctly, then you can delete this partition. The commands to do so are given below.\n\nNote: These commands may need to be prepended with a sudo.\n\ndiskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\n\nNote: The answer below applies to Macs which UEFI boot Windows. If you have an older Mac which legacy BIOS boots Windows, then you should should not use the answer below.\n\nIf the above commands are completed and the Mac is restarted, then your question will become a duplicate of the question Missing around 20 GB of Space on MacBook, at least in terms of a solution.\nTo add the remaining free space back to the partition containing macOS, the partition containing Windows would have to be first moved to the end of the drive. There are third party tools that can move Windows partitions. However, not all are compatible with macOS. According to the other post, there are two possible compatible free tools available. These tools are outlined below.\n\n*\n\n*GNOME Partition Editor (GParted). A Linux based bootable USB flash drive can be created containing this tool. After booting from the flash drive, the GParted tool can be used to move the Windows partition. If you build the bootable USB flash drive using the zip file downloaded from GParted, then both a keyboard and a mouse (or similar device) is required. One disadvantage is the keyboard and/or mouse may be need to be wired to use this tool. However, if you can boot from a Ubuntu installer flash drive, then only use of a mouse is required. One advantage is this tool does not have to be installed into Windows.\n\n\n*MiniTool Partition Wizard. This tool is installed into Windows. To move Windows, the Mac reboots and performs the move without user interaction. One advantage is any existing keyboard and mouse (or similar device) can be used. One disadvantage is this tool has to be installed in Windows and therefore will still exist on the drive after you are finished moving Windows.\n\nNote: Before attempting to move the Windows partition, the Windows chkdsk command should be applied to the NTFS volume in this partition. This can be accomplish by booting to Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) and entering the command below.\n\nchkdsk c: /f\n\n \n", "Q: knowledgeC.db could not be backed up My Time Machine backups keep failing.\nI get the message\n\nTime Machine couldn't complete the backup to \"NAS server\"\n\n\n\"/private/var/db/CoreDuet/Knowledge/knowledgeC.db\" could not be backed up.\n\n\nThe issue started a couple of days ago, but now it recurs regularly.\nRebooting does not help.

Generally, knowledgedc.db is a iOS SQLite db that effectively is a logfile on iOS. (I suspect this might be used on Monterey to support UIKit/iOS apps, but can not confirm).

I have a MacBook Pro and I wanted to make room on its hard drive. My current 256G HD has 110 GB occupied by iCloud, despite using the iCloud optimization feature. The consequence is that I have only 20G of free space, which I would like to increase to 30G. As folks know, the amount of free space is automatically set by Apple's algorithms. So, here is my question: if I create a mock file with random content (say, a 20G file), will this somehow \"force\" the algorithm to upload some of the non-used files to the cloud, thus allowing me to delete the mock file and free the space (at least for a small amount of time)?\n\nA: That is a legitimate strategy, one I’ve used before!\nHowever, there’s a better way that was added in macOS Catalina: right-click a file or folder in iCloud downloaded locally and choose Remove Download. This will offload the content locally and free space.\n", "Q: Refurbished iPhone 8's battery drains really quickly I just bought a refurbished iPhone 8 with 256 Gb.. Everything looks fine... except that the battery drains really quickly. If I charge it up to 80-85% and then leave it on the table, without using it (screen turned off, obviously), the battery will have drained in less than 24 hours.\nThis is with IOS 15.2 installed but without any apps except the stock ones; in fact, without even a SIM card or iCloud configured, just with Wifi connected to the local network.\nWhen I connect it to the Mac to check it using coconutBattery, it says that the refurbished battery is fine:\n\n14 cycles, 389 days, \"Desay Corporation\" (which is what my original iPhone 8's battery also says, so it must be the same part that Apple uses)...\nIs there any reason why I shouldn't return it? Is there any obscure reason why a new battery might give trouble during the first cycles, or why IOS 15.2 drains battery much faster while idle...? Anything other than the obvious explanation that it's defective?\n\nA: If you are sure the replacement battery is good, and you don't have a lot of background tasks running on your phone (apps that can access the internet even when not open), I can confidently say that the culprit is ios 15+.\nOne of it's new features is to detect unauthorized non-Apple parts on your device. On newer iPhones (11 and above) if you go to Settings > General > About, there will be a new section called \"Parts and Service History\". This will highlight if your battery, display or camera (depending on the iPhone model) is \"Genuine Apple Part\" or not.\nAnother new feature in it is Optimized Battery Charging (Settings > Battery > Battery Health > Optimized Battery Charging) that determines how and when your phone battery should be charged.\nIf Optimized Battery Charging is enabled, your phone may or may not charge fully depending on what Apple's algorithm decides (overall, I find it a useless feature more designed to collect our personal data - you have to enable location service to allow Apple to determine the places where you spend a lot of time, and also allow Apple access to data on how you use your phone).\nOn older iPhone models, I believe both the above mentioned features are quite buggy (to be cynical, deliberately buggy to force us to buy \"Genuine Apple Part\" or upgrade to a newer model).\nI am confident about this because I too have the same problem on an iPhone SE (1st generation) on which I replaced a battery from another iPhone SE. It worked fine, without any issue on the older ios 9 until it was upgraded to ios 15. After the upgrade, it doesn't show the battery charge correctly at all, and keeps shutting down abruptly.\n", "Q: How to overcome \"Target Display Mode\" from preventing sleep after disconnecting? I use my iMac almost every day as a 27\" external display with my MacBook Pro.\n\n*\n\n*While connected, the iMac won't go to sleep, which is exactly what it is expected.\n\n*But, after disconnecting, the iMac should go to sleep. Somehow, it is prevented (in order to always be ready to connect, again?). The problem: If you do not set it to \"sleep\" manually, it will stay on forever! This is really annoying to find your iMac running all night...\n\npmset -g | grep sleep tells you this:\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n sleep                10 (sleep prevented by sharingd, dpd, useractivityd)\n displaysleep         10 (display sleep prevented by dpd)\n\n\nObviously, sleep and display sleep are prevented by dpd (Display Port Daemon), see also an unanswered question in Apple Communities: DisplayPort daemon (dpd) blocks sleep even when not in use.\n\n\nA: sudo killall dpd works quite well! It seems like it is not working, because ps -ax still lists dpd as a running process. But, when calling pmset, the not on \"prevented by dpd\" is missing:\npmset -g | grep sleep\nhibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\nnetworkoversleep     0\ndisksleep            10\nsleep                10 (sleep prevented by sharingd, backupd)\ndisplaysleep         10\n\n\ndpd seems to be restarted right after killing it, which does make sense to always allow Target Display Mode to be used.

The main use in shell scripts is for having a piece of code where you want to define variables locally, without affecting the rest of your program.

Here is what I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*When I attach the phone to a PC, I get a DCIM folder with a bunch of subfolders, but nothing giving a clue to how the images are organized in albums, or even ordered by date. Further, I know there are complicated options about what is kept on the device and what is in iCloud. What I really want is a way to copy all of the pictures, whether on the phone or iCloud, to the PC. Does Apple try to make this difficult to lock you in to iCloud?\n\n\n*For the Voice Recorder .mp3 files, I can copy files from the application to the Files application in bulk, so that's good, but I don't know how to get them from Files to the PC in bulk. I tried various things but I only seem to be able to copy them one at a time. I tried using iZip but it failed, perhaps because the files are too large? The thing that seemed most promising was to add my Google Drive account as a \"Location\" in the Files app, and then drag all the recordings from the \"On this iPad\" location to the Google Drive location. But I waited hours and hours and it only seemed to copy one of the files out of the ~100 that were selected and dragged.\n\n\n*I found https://snapdrop.net/, which is cool, however again it only seems to let me copy one file at a time, which is not feasible. Again, I was thinking maybe I could zip the files, but iZip fails.\nI don't mind paying a reasonable amount for a backup/copy app, if that's what it takes, but I wasn't able to tell from the descriptions of the apps I looked at that they would do what I need.\nNote: I also did a full backup from the iPhone to my PC via iTunes. Unfortunately that creates a set of cryptically named files and folders. I'm assuming it's a proprietary format and there's no simple way to turn those into a regular directory of files?\nNote: I was hoping to copy to a PC, but if copying to a MacBook is easier, that works also.\n\nA: For photos, I recommend PhotoSync which is a paid app on the iPhone with free 'companion' apps for both Mac and Windows.\nAs the name suggests, PhotoSync synchronises photos from the iPhone to Mac/Windows - this is controlled from the iPhone app and uses Wifi. I use this regularly to transfer new photos to my iMac.

That having been said - and someone, anyone can correct me if or when I'm wrong? - Bitlocker could not be implemented through the TPM, presumably because my Windows OS operates as the slave volume and alterations with the TPM are impossible given File Vault is installed on the MacOS partition. Or, alternately, neither of the partitions interact, beyond the Bootcamp Assistant.\nI am unaware of whether or not the TPM comes factory installed on a MacBook Intel processor though, of course, the inverse is true for most modern if not all factory-shipped Windows machine. I am mentioning the TPM assuming that it's somehow involved with my inability to push updates - though this could be an irrelevant. Just a shot in the dark.\nEither way, since installing BitLocker, if either by coincidence or cause, I have been unable to install the next available Windows update; I believe it's stuck back on a failed execution step in the process of an attempted upgrade to 20H2. I doubt the update version is relevant though. I have attempted the update using PowerShell, thinking it will offer a surefire method given it operates with more elevated privilege or system control, but PowerShell failed on the update as well. I have also attempted the update in Safe Mode, which also fails.\nIf logs are needed for proper analysis and a consequent solution, please advise which output is needed from the given log or logs and I will post it accordingly. I have little-to-no interest in removing BitLocker before an additional upgrade attempt. For that reason, any advice involving that step may not be the best here unless it's the one-and-only solution.\n\nA: I found the solution to this however random. I did a few things though I can't remember in what chronological order. For one, I corrupted my Windows partition on Bootcamp by running a script off of Github which claimed to offer a better alternative to the third-party driver: Trackpad++. I nearly had to reinstall Windows but I did the obvious thing, given it was almost impossible to reinstall the Mac drivers for Windows, and used a wired mouse to navigate the OS.\nSo, with corded mouse in hand, as the trackpad wouldn't work at all - given the MacBook driver was shot - I simply reinstalled Trackpad++ but deleted the part of the program which runs the native control panel: essentially bloatware trying to get me to pay for stuff I don't need. I also ran - either before or after - the sfc /scannow command on the command prompt.\nI got curious as to whether or not the scan could have or would have fixed the update issue with failed patches. Oh, yes, and I may have ran the DISM command syntax with the \"RestoreHealth\" switch. I also booted Windows into safe mode, which is tricky on Bootcamp. If anyone wants to know how to do that, I'll explain. Long story short, one of those steps fixed it or a combination more than one did the trick.\nThe moral of the story? Windows on Bootcamp can be successfully updated when Bitlocker is installed. The OS gets buggy and the drivers don't like it, along with the encryption, but it can be done if the end user implements enough creative tech savvy in the process.\nAll things considered, I think this topic can be closed and whoever is moderating this topic can do so if desired. Any comments before this close out, are more than welcome. I'm eager to hear a theoretical explanation of why or how any of these steps worked\n", "Q: Wait time for resetting Apple Id account Recently, I tried the account recovery process of AppleID, which I had logged in.

I tried repeating the process and formatting the partition but still, nothing works.\nHere's the diskutil list (With the partition currently removed):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk3         749.9 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         119.8 GB   disk1s2\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +119.8 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk1s2\n   1:                APFS Volume macOS SSD               51.1 GB    disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume PreBoot                 23.4 MB    disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                509.8 MB   disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk2s4\n\n/dev/disk3 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +749.9 GB   disk3\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume HDD 800GB               518.5 GB   disk3s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 23.2 MB    disk3s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                509.8 MB   disk3s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      4.3 GB     disk3s4\n\n/dev/disk4 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.5 GB    disk4\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 BOOTUSB                 15.5 GB    disk4s1\n\n\nlist disk from diskpart returns something like this: (Again, really sorry about having no images, I will update them soon)\ndisk0: 111GB and 0B free (I suppose this is my SSD)\ndisk1: 698 and 0B free (Pretty sure this one is the hard drive)\ndisk2: 14gb and 0B free (Boot usb...?)\nAdditionally, under GPT, disk0 and disk1 both have * while disk2 doesn't.

Could be the results from me attempting the installation again a few times, though I'm not sure)\n\nA: This answer was tested using an iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013). Since this Mac is suppose to use an UEFI booting Windows 10, I did not actually test beyond the instructions given here. Your Mac is suppose to BIOS boot Windows 10.\nCreating a Partition on Each Internal Drive for Windows\nBased on the information posted in the question, the following command would create an approximate 100 GB partition for Windows on the HDD.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 650G exfat BOOTCAMP 0\n\nTo create a 50 MiB System Reserve partition on the SSD, the following command could be entered. However, you may have to move some files from the SSD to the HDD, if the SSD is out of space.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk1s2 119.771G exfat System 51Mi \n\nCreating a BIOS Booting Windows 10 USB Flash Drive Installer and Hybrid Partitioning the HDD\nYour Mac is suppose to install Windows 10 to BIOS boot. These instructions can be used to create a BIOS booting Windows 10 USB flash drive installer. Also, following these instruction will result in a hybrid partitioned internal HDD, which is a requirement for a dual boot of macOS and a BIOS booting Windows. The steps follow.\n\n*\n\n*Erase and partition a 16 GB or larger USB flash drive. Enter the command below and use the output to determine the identifier for the USB flash drive.\ndiskutil list external\n\nEnter the command below to erase and partition the USB flash drive. If your identifier is not disk4, then make the appropriate substitution.\ndiskutil partitiondisk disk4 mbr exfat WININSTALL 15G fat32 REFIND R\n\n\n\n*Install the rEFInd Boot Manager to the USB flash drive. Download the latest version of the rEFInd Boot Manager from SourceForge. (At the time this was written, the current version was 0.13.2.) Create a folder named efi on the REFIND volume. Next, create a folder named boot inside the efi folder. Inside the rEFInd download from SourceForge, there is a folder named refind. Copy the contents of this folder to the boot folder on the REFIND volume. Finally, rename refind_x64.efi file in the boot folder to bootx64.efi. The final result is shown below.\n\n\n\n*Mount the Windows ISO file and copy the contents to the WININSTALL volume. The file I downloaded from Microsoft was Win10_21H2_English_x64.iso.\n\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software. This should be done on the Mac where you are going to install Windows. When finished, copy the Windows Support Software to the WININSTALL volume.\n\n\n*Use Safari to acquire the latest 64 bit GPT fdisk for Windows (gdisk64.exe). Under Safari preferences, make sure \"Show Develop menu in the menu bar\" is checked off. Open a new Safari window then select Develop→User Agent→FireFox—Windows from the menu bar. Goto the SourceForge GPT fdisk website and select the Download button. When finished, close the Safari window.\n\n\n*From the GPT fdisk download from SourceForge, copy the file gdisk64.exe to the WININSTALL volume. When finished, the WININSTALL volume should appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n*Enter the following commands to add Mac Startup Manager icon labels.\nbless --folder /Volumes/REFIND/efi/boot --label rEFInd\nbless --folder /Volumes/WININSTALL/efi/boot --label \"Windows UEFI\"\n\n\n\n*Use the Mac Startup Manager to UEFI boot the Windows installer. Restart the Mac and immediately holding down the option key until the Mac Startup Manager icons appear. Select the icon with the label Windows UEFI.\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, press the shift+F10 key combination to open a Command Prompt window.\n\nEnter the following commands presented in the rest of this step.\ndiskpart\nlist disk\n\nUsing the values given in the Size column, determine the disk numbers assigned to the internal SSD and internal HDD from the values given in the Disk ### column.\nlist volume\n\nUsing the values given in the Label column, determine the volume number and drive letter assigned to the WININSTALL volume from the values in the Volume ### and Ltr columns, respectively. If the volume number you determined is different from 3, then make the appropriate substitution in the next command.\nselect volume 3\nactive\nexit\n\nIf the drive letter you determined is different from D, then make the appropriate substitution in the next command.\nbootsect /nt60 D: /mbr\n\nIf drive letter and/or SSD disk number you determined is different from D and 0, respectively, then make the appropriate substitutions in the next command.\nD:\\gdisk64 0:\n\nLike diskpart, gdisk64 is an interactive command. However, with gdisk64 the delimiter between a command and parameters can be either a space or a return. Also, you can quit without saving changes by pressing the control+C key combination. Below is a table of the entries you need to make. Enter the values in the SDD Entry column in the order shown.\n\n\n\n\nSDDEntry\nHDDEntry\nType\nComment\n\n\n\n\nr\nr\ncommand\nSwitch to recovery and transformation menu\n\n\nh\nh\ncommand\nMake hybrid MBR\n\n\n2 3\n2 3\nparameters\nAdd the second and third GPT entries add to the MBR table\n\n\ny\ny\nparameter\nConfirm to place EFI GPT (0xEE) partition first in MBR\n\n\nff\nff\nparameter\nMBR hex code for MBR partition 2\n\n\nn\nn\nparameter\nSkip setting bootable flag for MBR partition 2\n\n\n07\n07\nparameter\nMBR hex code for MBR partition 3\n\n\ny\nn\nparameter\nIf y then, set bootable flag for MBR partition 3\n\n\nn\nn\nparameter\nSkip adding adding more GPT entries to the MBR table\n\n\nw\nw\ncommand\nWrite table to disk and exit\n\n\ny\ny\nparameter\nConfirm to write and exit\n\n\n\n\nIf drive letter and/or HDD disk number you determined is different from D and 1, respectively, then make the appropriate substitutions in the next command.\nD:\\gdisk64 1:\n\nAbove is a table of the entries you need to make. Enter the values in the HDD Entry column in the order shown. When finished, enter the next command to close the Command Prompt window.\nexit\n\nAt this point, the USB flash drive can be BIOS booted and the internal drives are hybrid partitioned.\nBIOS Booting the Windows 10 USB Flash Drive Installer\nIn order to use the GUI provided by Microsoft to install a BIOS booting Windows 10, the installer has to be BIOS booted. Since the Mac Startup Manger can not properly instruct the firmware to BIOS boot the flash drive, the rEFInd Boot Manager is used instead. This section continues from where the previous section left off.\nEither select the red box with the white X or press the command+esc key combination, then select the Yes button. Immediately hold down the option key while the Mac restarts. When the Mac Startup Manager icons appear, select the icon labeled rEFInd.\nWhen the rEFInd Boot Manager icons appear, select a Windows icon showing a small flash drive, as shown below. The description displayed should contain the word \"legacy\". An example would be \"Boot Legacy OS from whole disk volume\". Note: More than one icon may appear.\n\nWhen BIOS booting from the flash drive, a long time may pass before anything meaningful appears. Be patient! Once the installer appear, proceed and install Windows 10. When asked: \"Where do you want to install Windows?\", do the following.\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the partition labeled System. Use the Format button to NTFS format the partition. Note: Formatting will remove the System label.\n\n*Highlight the partition labeled BOOTCAMP. Use the Format button to NTFS format the partition. Note: Formatting will remove the BOOTCAMP label.\n\n*With the partition formally labeled BOOTCAMP still highlighted, select the Next button.\n\nUpdate 1\nThe OP posted the following comment:\n\nThanks for the answer! Although..., everything seems to be working so far, on the gdisk part I get this error after skipping setting bootable flag for MBR partition 2: GPT partition #3 does not exist or is too big; skipping. Unused partition space(s) found. Use one to protect more partitions? (Y/N):\n\nNormally, I would use the output from the command below to determine what should be done next. (If drive letter and/or disk number you determined is different from D and 0, respectively, then make the appropriate substitutions.)\nD:\\gdisk64 -l 0:\n\nHowever, this might be difficult for you to post for me to see. Therefore, you could enter the command below which will write the output to the file gpt.txt on the flash drive.\nD:\\gdisk64 -l 0: >D:\\gpt.txt\n\nYou could then boot back to macOS, edit your question to include the contents of this file.\nUpdate 2\nSince the output from list disk shows the HDD to be Disk 1, you should have entered D:\\gdisk64 1: instead of D:\\gdisk64 0:.\nWarning: Since the SSD is disk 0, you will probably will not be able to install Windows on the HDD, unless there exists a 50 MiB System Reserve partition on the SSD. In other words, you will encounter the following message.\n\nI could include instructions now on how to create this fairly small partition. Or, you could wait and see, if you get the message.\nUpdate 3\nI would be asking the following questions.\n\n*\n\n*Does /Windows/System32/winload.exe exist in the third MBR partition on the HDD?\n\n*Is this the location specified in the /boot/BCD file?\n\nThe /boot/BCD file is suppose to be located in the System Reserve. The System Reserve is suppose to be located in the third MBR partition on the SSD. Note: Many of the files and directories in the System Reserve have the hidden attribute. You could UEFI boot from the Windows installer on the flash drive and enter the command below to get the drive letters for the partitions in the SDD and HDD.\necho list volume | diskpart\n\nHere, I will assume the System Reserve partition on the SSD is drive C: and the Windows partition on the HDD is drive D:.\nYou could then enter the command below to see if winload.exe exists.\ndir D:\\Windows\\System32\\winload.exe\n\nYou could also enter the command below to show the contents of the BCD file.\nbcdedit /store C:\\boot\\BCD /enum\n\nSee if you can post the output from these commands.\nUpdate 4\nApparently, you can get Windows to BIOS boot from the SSD, but for some reason the Windows software installed on the SSD can not execute the winload.exe file stored on the HDD. I tested this arrangement using a virtual machine and did not have any problems booting. The only difference between the virtual machine and your Mac is your HDD is drive E: and the HDD in the virtual machines is drive D:. I can not explain why your Mac is not using drive D: for the HDD or if drive D: is being used for something else. (Update 3 did ask of the output from echo list volume | diskpart, which was never posted.)\nMy remaining thought would be to install the Windows boot files on the HDD and see if the Mac Boot Manager or the rEFInd Boot Manager can successfully boot Windows from the new arrangement.\nYou could UEFI boot from the Windows installer on the flash drive and enter the command below to get the drive letter for the Windows partition on the HDD.\necho list volume | diskpart\n\nHere, I will assume the Windows partition on the HDD is drive E:. The following commands will write the boot files to the HDD.\nbootsect /nt60 E: /mbr\nbcdboot E:\\windows /l en-us /s E: /f bios\n\nYou can now try using the Mac Startup Manger to boot Windows. Also, you can use the Mac Startup Manager to boot rEFInd on the flash driven and then try booting Windows from the HDD by selecting the appropriate icon on the rEFInd menu. Since BIOS booting Windows files have now been installed on multiple drives, you may have difficulty determining which icon represents the internal HDD. If using rEFInd works, then we can discuss installing rEFInd to one of the internal drives.\n", "Q: How does macOS store the location of a file within a folder Sorry if this has been asked - super hard question to search for.\nWhen in icon view in finder you can move files around in a folder and arrange them however you want. When you come back to the folder the file icons all remember their arrangement so this data must be stored somewhere, I'd guess just as and x and y value.\nWhere is this data stored and can it be accessed and/or manipulated?\nI'm mostly just curious about how this works but I also think would be fun to try and write a game that just used file icons moving around in a folder as an interface.\n\nA: I'm of the same opinion as @Gilby: The information you're interested in is contained in the hidden .DS_Store file. But as the file's contents and structure are proprietary to Apple, it seems likely that you'll get mostly opinions instead of an answer to your question. Even though some aspects of the .DS_Store have been confirmed, there's no guarantee that they will remain unchanged. The best sources of information on this file may be in the .DS_Store Wikipedia article; some of the External links listed may give you some ideas or inspiration for the roving icon game you mentioned.\nAnother possibility is that some of the information of interest here is contained in the metadata squirreled away in the Apple File System (APFS) - another proprietary product from Apple.\nAnd while I'm opining on Apple's proprietary software, I'll close with a passage found in my research for this answer: \"open source accelerates that path to excellence\". If so much of Apple's success is based on open source software, why do they eschew it now?\n", "Q: Brand new iPad Pro has a year old battery, is that really ok? Greeting folks.\nAs stated, I picked up a new, off the shelf 12.9\" iPad Pro with the M1 onboard, and as someone who uses CoconutBattery for numerous devices over some time, I took at look to see what the reported capacity and info on this battery was, and apparently it is manufactured by Sunwoda and is already 352 days old. I apologize if this is a silly question, please inform me if so, but for something so expensive and off the shelf new, isn't the battery being practically a full year old already significant? Am I losing anything in terms of longevity (daily or long-term) already being that age?\nThank you.\n\nA: Battery degradation comes from these primary sources:\n\n*\n\n*Cycle count\n\n*Time spent at high or low states of charge\n\n*Temperature\n\nCycle count would have no impact in this scenario, since the battery is old but not previously used.\nThis means that the battery condition really depends on how well they store them. Presumably they store them in a temperature controlled environment, and no reason to believe they don't keep them at a healthy state of charge.\nThis means that your battery should be perfectly fine. Be aware that 80% capacity is the warranty threshold, so if the device is impacted by this and drops below 80% within the applicable warranty period, Apple will replace it.\n\nA: The 12.9\" iPad was introduced in May 2021. It's possible that the battery was manufactured slightly before that, but a whole five/six months seems unlikely.\nWhat date does Coconut Battery give for the manufacture of the iPad itself? I'd be surprised if an iPad Pro had been sitting on the shelf in an Apple Store since May: stock control is tight and sales are good.\nThe new iPad might store the relevant info in a different way from previous iPads, and Coconut Battery could be miscalculating/mis-parsing the manufacturing date from the info it gets.  Maybe report it to the devs for checking? (CB doesn't show the Manufacture date of my M1 MBP, nor the battery manufacturer, for example.)\nIt's certainly true that batteries degrade over time, regardless of use, though I would presume that Apple has thought about the manufacture process and the effects of initial storage in the comments it makes about battery life. Check the warranty terms and statutory rights for your location.\nYou could always take it back for a replacement, and see if that's any better.\n", "Q: How to disable .zsh_history & .zsh_sessions on macOS? By default in macOS zsh stores the history and sessions in the ~/.zsh_history & ~/.zsh_sessions files.\nHowever for one of my computers I want no Terminal/zsh history or session to be stored what so ever.\nIs there a way to disable this behavior in zsh?\n\nA: OK... Let me say this up front - in a blockquote to set it apart:\n\nThe answer to your question (and other zsh configuration questions) is dependent upon which macOS version you're using, and which terminal application you use. It is my opinion that Apple's well-intentioned (perhaps?), but ill-advised overreach is responsible for these dependencies. By this, I only mean to say that zsh is well-documented, and completely capable of handling your HISTORY preferences without any assistance from Apple. Yet, by their choosing to add their defaults to /etc/zshrc and /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal Apple makes it more difficult for users to change zsh defaults.\nREFERENCE\n\nAll of that said, I don't know which macOS version you're running, and as my macOS is 10.15 Catalina, I couldn't verify my answer will work on your system. Also: this answer is partially redundant with an earlier answer on a similar topic, and so please refer to that answer for details I've omitted here.\nProposed Answer: Set SAVEHIST=0 and HISTSIZE=0\nOpen the file ~/.zshrc in your editor, and add (or modify if they exist) the following two lines which override the macOS defaults:\n\nSAVEHIST=0\nHISTSIZE=0\n\nOrdinarily, one could put these changes into effect immediately by simply sourcing ~/.zshrc (. ~/.zshrc). However, given Apple's predilection for \"improving\" zsh, a reboot may be a better idea.\nThis change should prevent both session history and the history file from accumulating any command history. Catalina/10.15 (at least mine) does not have a file(s) named ~/.zsh_sessions. I don't know what its purpose is (other than possibly to retain session history?), but I don't believe it will override the above changes to ~/.zshrc.\nTry this if you care to, and let us know if it works on your system. There are other things to try - this one seems simplest.\n", "Q: Using a Python String on a Mac for a Non-Coder? I'm thrilled to find Navddeep's solution here How to convert an epub package to regular epub? yet two essential questions arise as I try to implement it.\n\n*\n\n*What in the string must I change to identify my unique paths, or anything else?\n\n\n*How can I convert this string—not yet a py file—into something I can test and use as an executable?

It is just text on a page as if you were reading a book.\nThe text if copied to a new file is a python program.\nThe steps are\n\n*\n\n*Copy the text into a new file in a text editor e.g. TextEdit or nano\n\n*Save the file as convert.py or another filename ending in .py The suffix is the standard for python files.\n\n*Edit the last two lines to alter the paths for input directory and the output epub file respectively and save\n\n*In a Terminal change directory to the directory you saved the python file in.\n\n*In Terminal run python convert.py Or what ever you named the file as\n\nI think this code works as python2 so will work with the Apple installed python - however if not you need a python3 and the easiest way is to install this via installing Xcode and its command line tools. You then need to run the command line as python3 convert.py\nAs a programming note I would not be using the subprocess.run to deletete things and zip the file. I would use that using python functions\nThe other answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/372808/237 is probably easier to deal with. Just run the given command in the terminal\n\nA: regarding point 1:\nit seems you should change path_to_files = \"\" to  path_to_files = \"path\\to\\your\\folder\\where\\the\\books\\are\" and thats it\nregarding point 2:\nThe simplest solution is to create a new text file, past the code into it and run $ python new_file\nIf you are reluctant to create a file, you can type in your terminal python -c ', then paste the text, and finally add another quote ' mark and press enter\n\nA: If anyone else on a Mac needs to do this yet struggles with Python I found a much easier solution here.

I've also updated the iPhone to the latest software version.\nI have two phones, both iPhone XS running the latest iOS (15.1 or 15.2), that I backed up to my Mac yesterday from Finder. My Mac is on macOS Monterey 12.0.1. I am now having issues restoring those backups. I am experiencing the exact same issues restoring backup 1 to a new iPhone 13 and restoring backup 2 to an iPhone XS. So, the below applies to both phones:\nIssue 1: When I plug my phone in and then select \"Restore Backup\" in Finder, the Finder hangs on \"Erasing Phone\", even though I can see that the phone has been erased and is now on the new phone setup screen. After waiting 30 minutes with no changes in Finder, I unplugged the phone (eject didn't work) and plugged it back in, and then Finder recognized the phone (the name updated to the name from the backup) and automatically shows \"Restoring iPhone from backup\". Nice. Maybe this isn't an issue, but I wanted to include these details\nIssue 2: When the phone starts restoring from backup, the Finder initially shows the progress bar moving left and right (i.e. it feels like it's doing something but still deciding how long it will take), but after maybe 10-20 seconds, the progress bar shows completely filled, and there's no animation or indication that anything is happening. This is what I see:\n\nMeanwhile, my phone just shows the \"Connect to Mac or to a PC with iTunes\" screen and gives no indication that a restore is in progress. I can even tap \"Back\" and continue with setup.\nI left my phone connected for several hours just in case it was working, but the screens never changed, so I disconnected my phone, and it is still in the initial setup state.\nFor Phone 1, I gave up and tried restoring from the old phone with Quick Start (holding the phones next to each other), and that failed three times in a row after almost two hours each time. I ended up backing up the old phone to iCloud and restoring that way, which worked great.\nFor phone 2, I no longer have the old phone, so restoring from this Mac backup is my only option.\n\nA: I was eventually able to get this to work. After updating to the latest macOS and iOS versions and still not having success, I decided to put my phone into recovery mode and choose the \"Restore\" option. This did a full factory reset and updated the software (which I thought I had already done, but maybe this was different).\nI then went through the initial phone setup flow on my phone and chose “Restore from Mac or PC backup”, just like I'd done so many times before. This time, when I opened my phone through Finder on my Mac, the UI was a little different. It was a simpler screen that seemed tailored to a new phone setup as opposed to the normal \"Sync phone\" screen that shows storage, sync options, etc. The only options were to set up the phone from scratch or restore from a backup. I selected my backup.\nThis time, the iPhone changed to say “Restore in Progress” (I had never seen that) and did not erase the device first, which is something that always happened from the other Finder UI. The progress indicator worked, and the restore took maybe 2-3 hours and was successful.\n", "Q: Difference between root ('/') and \"Computer\" If I open the finder and navigate to Go>Computer, then I am presented with all the mounts, while navigating to the root / using Shift+Command+G seems to be a different directory. In particular it seems to be only the main drive. Activating show path bar in the \"view\" of the finder does not help. The question is: what is the path to the Go>Computer view (as this seems to be the only way to navigate to mounts). Or: where are mounts located on the Mac?\nIt should not be so frustrating to simply access a mounted volume from the finder. And how can I put the Go>Computer folder into my favourites?\nupdate: Below is a picture of the \"documents\" mount created by cryptomator. Which was not in the \"Favourites\" until I dragged it there from the \"Computer\" view. Also the path in the bar just says \"documents\"\n\nupdate 2: the preferences should result in all mounts being displayed in locations but the \"documents\" volume is not.\n\nupdate 3: as per request the output of mount.

They are not mounted at root.\nYou can set Finder Preferences to show \"Computer\" (normally \"Felix's iMac\" or whatever), and mounted volumes in the Sidebar of Finder windows, under the \"Locations\" heading, which is a different category from Favorites. You can swap the order to make Locations higher/lower than Favorites.\n\nThere are also settings to show mounted volumes on the Desktop.\n\nThe Finder tab and window name should show the path /Volumes/my disk, as here:\n\nIf you want to unhide /Volumes, you can do that with this command:\nsudo chflags nohidden /Volumes\n\nIt will then appear normally under Macintosh HD in the Finder.\nYou can always find the full pathname of an object in the Finder by holding Alt Command C.

I'd like to buy a new monitor and have been looking at models that have an in-built KVM switch functionality as this would both reduce cabling/connections and enable me to use the monitor for home and Work-From-Home easily. I'm aware I could get a separate KVM, but one that's already in the monitor seems ideal.\nI have a home MacMini (2020, M1) and a work MacBook Pro (16\" late 2019, Intel). Both have USB-C connectors with Thunderbolt 3 which both state:\n\nNative DisplayPort output over USB‑C\n\nin the technical specs (linked above).\nI'm aware that I may need specific cables such as Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) Cable\nBefore buying the monitor, is there any way to verify that at least one of the Macs has the required feature/signalling to communicate to the monitor so that it can use the KVM feature?\nThis whole question was brought up by a review of the monitor which mentioned the DisplayPort Alt Mode issue.\n\nA: Yes, both the 2020 M1 Mac Mini and the 2019 16\" MacBook Pro supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode. All Thunderbolt 3 ports (as those on those Macs) supports USB-C Alternate Mode for DisplayPort.\nNote that often I see that monitors with built-in KVM have non-obvious drawbacks or \"things that might annoy you\". You need to think your use case through and do testing to figure out if it does everything you want. For example you might find that the automatic switching of keyboard/mouse doesn't work as you want it to, or that the monitor has difficulty dealing with computers that go into sleep mode, or similar problems. This is not specific to Apple computers - it is general issues that come into play with any type of computer.\n\nA: My testing cases showed the monitors with a built-in KVM switch function will have many issues with your setup profile for I have 100% same hardware profile as yours (M1 Mac Mini and 2019 MacBook Pro 16 -the intel-based).\nI recommend using an external KVM switch solution for your setup profile.\n\n*\n\n*Pick any DisplayPort monitor without built-in KVM switch function or without PIP (picture in picture) or PBP (picture by picture) as your sharing monitor.

You can do that in various ways depending on your exact application - a simple way (if you're displaying the captured video) is to simply film the display with an iPhone set for slow-motion capture and then quickly slide a black piece of paper (or well anything really) in front of the camera. By examining the video filmed on the iPhone, you can count the number of frames from the time you slide the paper over the camera until the display goes black. If your phone captures at 240 fps, each frame is about 4.17 milliseconds.\nYou can decrease latency (and jitter) by ensuring that the involved software has high priority settings (also ensure you have the right nice values, the right QoS setting, etc), that no unnecessary software is running at the same time, etc.\n", "Q: Cannot access IMac OS (2009 X Snow Leopard) from Window 7 Bootcamp Control Panel or option key I'm currently using an Imac 2009 running (Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6) and I wish to switch from my  Windows 7 to my Mac OS and make that the default OS.

This results in the arithmetic expression x, which evaluates to the numerical value of x. But x is unset, hence the error that you see.\nGenerally, be careful with associative arrays in arithmetic expressions.\n[[ $arr[(Ie)x] ]] would work for a non-empty key. Alternatively, ((${+arr[x]})) is more common, but I don't see any advantage to it: it also doesn't work with empty keys.

I recently got a Mac, and have been getting acquainted with it. One thing I have run into is that the Mac appears to deviate from standards for keyboards for the Danish layout.\nIn my specific situation I was trying to type @ which on a Danish keyboard is done by either hitting Ctrl+Alt + 2 or AltGr+2. However, on Mac, they've moved this character to Alt+'. This makes for a bit of a jarring experience switching between development environments.\nI tried looking for a reason but was unable to find it. My first instinct was to add a custom keyboard layout that matches the standard, but that leaves me wondering if there is a specific way to remap the keys without concerns I might break existing shortcuts.\nCan I remap @ to control - option - 2 on my Danish ISO keyboard?\n\nA: Apple sold keyboards with a Danish layout before the standard was created and published. As we can only guess as to why Apple's engineers chose to do what they did, it is reasonable to guess that this history has something to do with it. I.e. why annoy existing users with moving about characters on the keyboard in order to follow relatively non-significant ISO standard. That said, as far as I remember, the original ISO7IEC 9995 standard didn't even specify the placement of the @ character on the keyboard. That was added to the standard decades later.\nNote also that historically keyboards were very different from computer to computer. When you look at keyboards from the 70's and 80's, you won't find that they all featured essentially the same character placement - like you would find if you compared a 2000's or 2010's keyboard to a current keyboard.\nSo essentially, you're kinda incorrect in saying that \"they moved\" the character to that location - for Danes it didn't have a specific location where user expected it to be at the time. It wasn't like the @ character was placed on the same key as on modern Danish PC keyboards and stayed there for a few years before Apple decided to move it to a different location.\nOn the original Macintosh keyboard - the @ character even on US keyboards was placed on the first key in the top row (left of the 1 key). On the Danish version of the Apple II (europlus), the @ character was actually placed on top of the \"P\" key.\nFor comparison, a non-Mac computer that many Danish people got to know in the 80's were the Danish built Piccolo and Piccoline models. The Piccolo didn't have a @ on its keyboard, and the Piccoline placed it just left of the backspace key on the far right of the main keyboard.\nAlso you need to consider that at the time these keyboards were first introduced, the @ character was simply not used as much as it is today. Today most people know this character as the seperator in email addresses, calling it the \"at character\", etc. That was not the case in the early days of computing. At that time it was known as the \"master space\"* character, and it wasn't something a normal Mac user would need multiple times during a normal working hour. Hence when locations were scarce on the Danish keyboard layout, it probably weren't a huge priority to give it an easy to reach placement.\nUPDATE: The question was changed to be about remapping the key. You can use the tool Ukelele to remap the location of the @ character on the keyboard.\n*: Separator between commands and data.\n", "Q: I want my Mac to only bring the top window of an app to the front when clicking the app icon in the dock I work/live with Windows/Linux/Mac every day. While I'm pretty comfortable with Windows/Linux some Mac behaviors do throw me off.\nOne of these behaviors is the following: I have several open windows of an app (e.g. VS Code or iterm) and I'm using the browser in the foreground. Now imagine I want to type something into VS Code so I click on the icon in the dock OR maybe activate it through spotlight. What I expect/want to happen is that the top window of VS Code appears in the front like it does for example on Linux (Pop OS). What happens instead is that my Mac brings literally every instance of VS Code I've opened to the front of the window stack which is completely clouding my desktop. Is there any way I can turn this off / change the behavior to the Linux one? I could not find any solution yet.\n\nA: It's not a \"Linux behavior\", it's the behavior of whatever DE you use on Linux.  It is also the default behavior on MacOS 10 and later.  Classic macOS has the opposite behavior.\nThere are several applications that will modify this behavior to bring all windows of an application to the foreground.  One of these is Front and Center, by John Siracusa.\n\nI have just tested on macOS Big Sur 11.6.2.  I opened three VS Code windows and stacked them on top of each other.  I then opened another window (TextMate, not that it matters), and put it on top of them all.  Then I clicked the various VS Code windows.  The TextMate window was interleaved between them as you would normally expect it to be.\nSounds like you have such an application running.\n", "Q: How can I get rid of bloatware?

I’ve found some applications on Android that show the MAC address for previously-stored Bluetooth devices but none on Apple. All I can find is Bluetooth scanners which won’t work for what I want to do.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this. However, you can make an backup to your computer, and open it in a backup viewer. The steps may vary depending on what program you use to open the backup, but for iMazing:\n\n*\n\n*Open File System\n\n*Open System Shared Containers\n\n*Navigate to SysSharedContainerDomain-systemgroup.com.apple.bluetooth/Library/Database\n\n*That folder should contain two SQLite databses (com.apple.MobileBluetooth.ledevices.paired.db and com.apple.MobileBluetooth.ledevices.other.db)\n\nExport the two files, and from there you can try to find the device's address using a database browser.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Safely delete old \"Macintosh HD - Data\" partition? I recently installed a new update and it took a lot of data. Assuming that I do not need old data in my \"Macintosh HD - Data\" how do I safely make room for some?\n\n\nA: Firstly, your Macintosh HD and the snapshot following it are mostly linked to the same blocks in the APFS container. Their total size on disk is lot less than 44.2 GB.\nYou MUST NOT try and remove Macintosh HD - Data. That is where all your apps, settings and data are stored.\nYou have a very small internal disk and will always be constrained as to what you can store on it.  My best advice is to:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a good backup (using, for example, Time Machine) in case of problems.\n\n*Buy and connect an external SSD (e.g. a Samsung T7). Format it as AFPS.\n\n*Move some of your files (documents, photos, etc.) to the external SSD. Depending on your version of macOS and apps you use, you will need to take care moving stuff. You will need to keep the external SSD connected at all times.\n\n*Make sure you are backing up the new SSD.\n\nAs an alternative, you could take advantage of macOS's \"Optimise Mac Storage\" feature that allows you to transparently store most of your documents (and other files) in iCloud. This will require an iCloud subscription and permanent Internet connection. I very much prefer the external SSD solution.\n", "Q: How can I make a column reference a row in another table?

Tap in the bottom-right corner of the screen in that menu, and then tap Transpose Rows and Columns.\nUnfortunately, the transposed table needs to be recreated manually whenever you add new records to the original table or update the existing ones.\n", "Q: How do I subvert this locked uber-secure OSX boot process to do a clean install?

I have to install some apps on my personal iPhone from a big and regular company, and the apps are from the \"Untrusted Enterprise Developer\", not from the App Store.\nThe authentication must be agreed to use the apps. While it seems that some private APIs of Apple may be used in the apps not coming from the App Store. And I don't know what APIs will be used. So I'm worried about my personal privacy because of the \"private APIs\".\nI want to know that, is my text message, call history, photos, or other information on the mobile phone still safe? In other words, are the apps from \"Untrusted Enterprise Developer\" in the same privacy level as the apps from the App Store, if I authorize them with the same permissions? Should I worry about the former apps particularly in my use?\n\nA: Whether or not you should worry is highly individual and cannot really be answered in general.\nFirst you write that you \"have to\" install these apps. Why would you \"have to\" do this?\nIf this is mandated by your employer, you could try arguing that you need a work device issued by that employer.\nIf this is mandated by your government, there's probably not much choice in the matter and you would need to take your own precautions regarding your personal data.\nSecond, it is impossible for us to know how important it is for you to keep your personal data safe and private. Do you only have mundane text messages from your employer and a few standard photographs of scenic landscapes - or do you store highly sensitive data such as data about your health or even evidence gathered for an upcoming lawsuit against said company?\nYou would need to do a risk assessment and figure out what kind of risk you can tolerate.\nEssentially, enterprise apps are supposed to \"play by the rules\". The enterprise developer is bound by a contract with Apple that restricts them from various nefarious activity - however, this particular company might be willing to breach contract. It is hard to know without knowing which company, we're talking about.\nEnterprise apps are run in the same sandbox as ordinary App Store apps. The main difference is that these apps are not subject to the standard App Store Review by Apple before being allowed to be installed on devices. This means that an enterprise developer could be exploiting bugs in the operating system in order to break out of the sandbox.\nIt's not something that's normal for enterprise apps, and not something you would expect from a big corporate employer in a modern country... however it is a risk.\nYou should not put much extra meaning into the fact that it states \"Untrusted Enterprise Developer\" - it doesn't mean that this is some particularly bad or untrustworthy enterprise developer. It simply means that this is the first time you're installing apps from that particular enterprise developer, and that the device is not managed (MDM) by that company.\n", "Q: Certs from Smart Card not showing up or viewable in keychain I am trying to get a smart card reader functioning on my Mac just upgraded to 12.1 and the reader is seen by the system, and the card is shown, but no certs?

I suspect the apps are doing this intentionally to save resources. It may also apply to other Apple apps; I haven’t investigated.\nWhile this might be a case of “feature, not bug!,” it’s a pain for me.

Sometimes these tabs go \"out of control\" and chew up all the CPU and memory (GB of swap) to the point where my M1 MacBook Air grinds to a halt and the mouse pointer starts stuttering. The only way to fix it is to quit Safari. I can easily do this by clicking on the Dock and Command-Q... the GUI may take a minute or two to catch up, but once Safari quits, everything returns back to normal - a nice speedy M1 with not much software loaded.\nI can't figure out why this is happening. I run a clean system, no sketchy software. Only 2 browser extensions, Duck Duck Go and Vinegar. (Inactivating the extensions does not fix the issue.)

Yes, each!\nThe only thing I expected to see here that took up that much memory were actively running programs like Activity Monitor itself, Excel, Safari, etc. So, putting on my thinking cap I thought that maybe it could be these were still being detected by the system somehow even after Safari had been exited.\nThe resource hogs were due to various bookmarks on Safari (i.e. YouTube -- for which I linked to a half-dozen or so content creators) that were being a bottleneck to the overall system performance. Having since removed those bookmarks, the system is now running without a hitch. I was even surprised that was the root cause (as I have never seen bookmarks to be problematic), but it worked and this system woe is behind me, thankfully.\nNote: As of this post, I haven't been able to repro it on-the-spot and I suspect it takes days or weeks on end that the system gets clogged up.\n", "Q: How to upgrade ssh on OS X 10.9 Mavericks without OS upgrade?

Ed25519 is there since OpenSSH version 6.5.\nAs well as the old ssh-agent returns SHA-1 instead of SHA-256 signatures for RSA logins, thus errors like\n\nagent key RSA SHA256: returned incorrect signature type\n\nwill appear when connecting to bleeding edge hosts.\nI would like to get rid of these error message and use the faster and more secure ED25519.\nHow to upgrade SSH without upgrading Mac OS X?\n\nA: Running $ sudo brew install openssh with success, renaming the built-in /usr/bin/ssh* executables and running $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 is not enough to use your ed25519 key with the new ssh version.\nDisable Mac OS X ssh-agent\nYour ssh logins will still only use the rsa key because the new ed25519 key is not known (to ssh-agent). ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 will return:\n\nCould not add identity xxx: agent refused operation\n\nbecause Mavericks will run the old ssh-agent version or not at all. Better disable launching the built-in ssh-agent using: $ launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist. Check with ps -ef that no ssh-agent is running, otherwise kill that pid.\nStart new version ssh-agent automatically\nNow it's time to learn your OS X terminal shell to start the newer ssh-agent automatically, once. When using zsh as shell, run $ nano .zshrc and append this:\n# Automatically start ssh-agent once\nif [[ \"x\" == \"x`ps -x -u ${USER} | egrep '[s]sh-agent'`\" ]] ; then\n    ssh-agent | sed -e \"/^echo/d\" > ${HOME}/.ssh/agent-env\n    source ${HOME}/.ssh/agent-env\n    ssh-add -qk\nelse\n    source ${HOME}/.ssh/agent-env\nfi\n\nBased upon code from: Automatically Start ssh-agent on Mac OS X\nNow your newly opened terminal sessions will use the old rsa and new ed25519 keys.\nVerify ssh-agent keys\nThe fingerprints of keys that are loaded in ssh-agent can be listed with $ ssh-add -l. Displayed order is important here. The keys are tried in the order as listed from top to bottom. This is also the order in which keys were imported. Current openssh source code has this key import priority for key-add:\n\n*\n\n*RSA\n\n*DSA\n\n*ECDSA\n\n*ED25519\n\n*XMSS\n\nPrefer ED25519 over RSA\nIn case you wish to prefer Ed25519 cryptography over RSA when both are available, you need to override the order in which the keys are loaded.\nThus change the ssh-add -qk in the code above to something like:\nssh-add -qk ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\nssh-add -qk ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n", "Q: How to get cookies.txt for YouTube from Safari? I want to get my cookies.txt for YouTube so that I can youtube-dl my liked videos playlist.\nHow can I get my cookies from Safari? Opening the web inspector just lets me view them, I can't see how to download the text file from here.\n\nA: Safari cookies are located under ~/Library/Cookies. However, they're binary cookies, so you'll have to decode it to human-readable (Netscape equivalent) cookies.\nTo do so, you would have to install this tool and follow the instruction (I've never used it before, so I don't know if this still works.)\nPersonally, I'd rather just install Chrome (or a browser that uses Chromium, such as Vivaldi, etc) and use extensions like Get cookies.txt, though.\n", "Q: Does the action of private APIs of iOS need user's manual authentication? Some iOS apps from my company need to be installed to my iPhone, which are \"untrusted enterprise certificate\" apps, not from the \"app store\".\nConsidering the possible usage of private APIs, I want to find out that whether the actions of these private APIs need my manual authentication just like normal apps from \"app store\"?\nIn addition, can private APIs break through the sandbox mechanism of iOS?\n\nA: When an enterprise app uses private APIs, the user is not informed nor asked whether to allow that usage.\nHowever, it is not so that the use of private APIs automatically mean that the app has access to \"more data\" or somehow circumvents existing security checks. This means that if for example the app wants to use photos from your library, it still has to ask permission to use that library, just like any other app you install from the App Store.\nUnfortunately it is possible for private APIs to have bugs that nefarious programmers can exploit in order to circumvent security checks. This is also true for public APIs, but it is probably slightly more likely that private APIs will have bugs of this sort.\nAlso note that installing an app from the App Store is not a guarantee that private APIs won't be used - far from it. The App Store review processs contains some automatized and manual checks that tries to spot the use of private APIs, but it is definitely not foolproof. It is relatively easy for a malicious developer to slip something past this review. Doing so is not without possible consequence for the developer though, as it is possible for Apple to take various steps if this is uncovered later. Ranging from having the developer create an update without the private API usage and up to banning the developer from the App Store and removing their apps from user's phones and suing for damages.\nThere's no private API that is specifically built for breaking through the sandbox mechanism in iOS. That wouldn't make sense. Private APIs are built by Apple in order to be used in their own apps - and are usually made public in later releases when they have been fine tuned, bugs are fixed and documentation has been created. They wouldn't intentionally create something that invalidates all their work on security.\nHowever, it is again perfectly possibly for any API to have a bug that can be used to escape the sandbox. It is not so that any bug has this property, so it is very hard to find bugs and exploits that would go into this.\nAnother way to look at it is this:\nWill the local 200 employee company, that requires you to install an enterprise app for employee work hours registration, be likely to create a secret exploit that will escape the iOS sandbox and invade your privacy? - Probably not.\nWould a fascist dictatorship, that requires journalists to install an enterprise app for seemingly no purpose, be likely to include a secret exploit that will escape the iOS sandbox and invade their privacy? - I would worry about that.\n", "Q: Continuous chime after RAM upgrade on Middle 2011 MAC Mini Good afternoon. I have a Mac Mini, which came with a 2 Gb 1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SO-DIMMs but I already tried to upgrade with 2 kits:\n\n*\n\n*Timetec 8GB KIT(2x4GB) Compatible for Apple DDR3 1333MHz PC3-10600\n\n*Timetec 16GB KIT(2x8GB) Compatible for Apple DDR3 1333MHz PC3-10600 CL9\n\nAnd after I installed both upgrades, the Mac Mini does the chiming sound repetitively. But when I put the 2 Gb stick back it works. Am I missing any step or just being unlucky with the RAM sticks?\n\nA: Presumably, this is a 2011 Mac Mini? That's the only one that takes that speed of memory.\nMacs (of that era) make different chimes at startup if there is a problem with the RAM.\nSo,\n\n*\n\n*either the RAM is 'bad' in some way\n\n*or it's not seated correctly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the RAM is slower than the computer requires. Sometimes, it will still work, but sometimes it won't.\n", "Q: Why is exFAT so slow on Mac? (reloaded) I have read questions here about exFat and its performance on the Mac. I think I can refute the previous answers and am therefore still looking for an answer or solution. But from the beginning:\nMy setup:\n\n*\n\n*A Western Digital Elements 5TB as external hard drive.\n\n*MacBook Pro 2021\n\n*Windows laptop (>5 years old)\n\n*3.5TB data stored on a NAS\n\nScenario 1 (Mac on exFat):\nI have formatted the external drive with the Mac as exFat. I try to copy the data from the NAS to the external hard drive. After approx. 6 hours of running time, another 9 days are assumed. Only a relatively small amount of data was copied, so the remaining 9 days would probably have been needed. The activity LED on the hard disk also shows very long pauses. This seemed very suspicious to me.\nScenario 2 (Windows on exFat):\nThe previous data is deleted (not reformatted). I start the copying process. The prognosis is 9 to 10 hours under Windows. I abort after a few hours. A significant part of the data is copied which makes the prediction of 9 to 10 hours seem realistic. The activity LED on the hard disk flashes continuously.\nScenario 3 (Mac on APFS):\nI format the external hard disk with the Mac and start the copying process. Forecast: approx. 9 hours remaining time. The activity LED on the hard disk flashes continuously.\nConclusions:\nexFat may have its optimisations for SSDs. But it is possible to write to the same disk with the same cable and the same data under Windows significantly faster. (Scenario 1+2)\nIt is not due to the external hard drive or the additionally required adapter from USB-A to USB-C on the Mac. The hard disk can also be written to with the Mac in 9 hours (Scenario 3).\nHence the question again:\n\n*\n\n*Why is exFAT so slow on the Mac?\n\n*What can I do to make the disk usable for a Windows PC?\n\nUpdate 2022-01-10:\nHere is a small update of my further investigations\nTest 1:\nCopy 1 file 39.76GB\nAPFS 5m 54s\nexFAT 5m 50s\nTest 2:\nCopy 13 files 138,92GB\nAPFS 21m 09s\nexFAT 21m 32s\nTest 3:\nCopy 1.31 TB\nAPFS 3h 29m 50s\nexFAT 3h 30m 45s\nUp to this point, both file systems look about equally fast.\nTest 4:\nCopy entire 3,5TB\nAPFS <10 hours (exact stop time missed)\nexFAT >15 hours (stopped here) only 486GB on external hard drive\nThe point is completely illogical to me. Here, significantly less was copied than in the previous test with 1.31TB and in a significantly longer time. This means that the speed was slower from the beginning.\nTest 5:\nCopy entire 3.5TB with Paragon NTFS driver: approx. 9h 30m\nConclusion:\nThe file systems are about the same speed for small amounts of data (<1.31TB). But something happens between 1.31TB and 3.5TB.\nSince the tests are very time-consuming and it is quite difficult to time the copying, I would like to stop my tests at this point. The tip with Paragon fits perfectly in my case.\n\nA: The reason it is slow is that the implementation is not as optimized as it could have been.\nA third party exFAT driver for macOS exists that you could try out. I doubt that it has better performance for. It is open-source and can be downloaded for free.\nIn order to format the disk so it can be used with better performance on both your Windows PC and your Mac, you can try a different file system. If you like exFAT and primarily have smaller files, you might be able to make do with FAT32 which is natively supported by both operating systems.\nAlternatively you could format the drive as APFS, which is the native file system on macOS, and then install an APFS for Windows driver on your Windows PC. Note that the linked software is commercial and requires purchasing a license.\nYet another alternative is to format the drive as NTFS, which is the native file system on Windows, and then install an NTFS for macOS driver on your Mac. The NTFS driver that comes with macOS is read-only, so a separate driver is necessary in order to get read/write access. Note that the linked software is commercial and requires purchasing a license.\n", "Q: Monterey - create new user & group with IDs 1000 I was trying to create a new user and a new group with the IDs of 1000 (requirement) but I ended up not being able to log in to the account in a regular way from the Login screen, however login from the terminal worked just fine. All I got on the Login screen was an endless spinning wheel and the user didn't show up with the other users. Any ideas?\nI created a new group & user from Users&Groups in Preferences and then changed the User's GroupID to 1000 manually in the advanced settings.

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) from Mid-2014 which is vintage classed. It is running MacOS Catalina 10.15.7 (not Big Sur which is the later OS available).\nRecently I am experiencing rather frequent random sudden shutdowns (multiple per day or near-daily). The screen suddenly becomes dark but the computer is still on. After 20 seconds or so, it powers off completely. This happens when plugged in with charger (not sure if it happens on battery or not). From some of these shutdown events, it looks to be related to code -128, which is an \"unknown  cause\": (Shutdown Cause -128) or possibly related to memory issues.\n$ sudo log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Previous shutdown cause\"'\n\nFiltering the log data using \"composedMessage CONTAINS \"Previous shutdown cause\"\"\nSkipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.\nTimestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    TTL  \n2022-01-06 11:46:14.824317+0100 0xb5       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: -128\n\nI have tried resetting SMC, and NVRAM/PVRAM (holding Opt-CMD-P-R on boot), and run the Apple Diagnostics on startup (holding D on boot). I still have the same issue, and Diagnostics didn't find any issues.\nBattery health is at 88% (battery and top case replaced in early 2019).\nI just discovered that on my charger, the wiring inside is exposed (the outer material protecting them have somewhat broken at a place). I can't tell if there is sufficient damage or not to the wiring. An extreme close-up (hardly visible to the eye) in the photo shows that there has at least been some minimal tearing to the wire:\n\nIs it possible that this can be causing voltage issues? If so, can I use electric tape to cover it up, or do I need to buy a new charger?\nI am somewhat hesitant to buying a new charger, because I suspect that the exposed wiring may not be the problem, and that there is a bigger hardware issue at fault – in which case investing further in this vintage-classed computer may be cost inefficient.\nI would also appreciate general advice on how to proceed with this matter altogether.\n\nA: I have had several chargers where the outer cover fails like that.\ngiven the size of the magsafe connector there won't be an easy fix with shrinkfit tube, done that with smaller ones.\nAny tape wrapped around will only be temporary, as it will unwrap, get sticky etc.\nI found the best solution was to open the charger and shorten the cable so only good outer cover is there. Fiddly and you need to crack the charger case, possible with a sharp knife through the little valley or seam on the charger - do NOT cut too deep... Make sure you leave the charger unplugged for at least 24h before attempting as the caps inside will let you know otherwise...\n\nA: You should take a look at this link. The steps for Catalina are:\n(MacOS 10.14, 10.15)\n\n*\n\n*Reboot with Cmd+R pressed.\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*sudo csrutil disable\n\n*reboot in normal mode\n\n*sudo mount -uw /\n\n*sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltNHI.kext /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltNHI.kext.BAK\n\n*csrutil enable\n\n*Reboot and forget about the problem\n\nI have been facing the same problem with my MacBook Pro Mid 2014 Retina 15-inch. This turns out to be a common problem in these MacBooks and after a lot of troubleshooting the only thing that solved my problem was disabling some thunderbolt drivers as shown in the link.\nIf you want more info on the hardware problem behind this shutdown you can see this video explaining the faulty FDMF 6808N chips in the logic board that cause the issue.\nPS. I don't think the charger causes an issue here but you might want to fix it up with some tape.

I recently ran a MacOS update and when it was finished... my Desktop was empty!  Not only that, when I browsed to the Desktop folder, everything appeared to be gone.  I save a lot of work to my desktop, so I had a minor panic attack thinking the update deleted my files.\nAfter looking at my Recent Files list, I tried to open a few documents that I knew were stored on the Desktop.  They still existed.  After further exploration, I found that all files and folders on my Desktop were somehow flagged as hidden.\nAgain, I have a lot of files and folders on my desktop.  I know of the chgflags unhidden ... command, but I have to call that for every single file and folder.  I also know how to make hidden files visible within finder/terminal/Desktop UI, but I really would prefer to not have to do that and instead update each file and folder to not be hidden.\nIs there a way to iterate through an entire directory and make all files permanently unhidden?

When I execute the command, nothing is reported and I am kicked back to the prompt--a usual sign that the command worked properly.  Regardless, I can't see these files.\nI must re-iterate again that this morning I updated my machine.  I try to keep it up to date, regardless.  This was not happening, and has never happened, before a restart after the MacOS update.\nEDIT #2\nHere's a screenshot of the Get Info screen for the above file.\n\n\nA: cd Desktop\nchflags nohidden *\n\nshould do the trick for all files on your desktop.\nTo change all files and directories you can run\nchflags -R nohidden $HOME\n\nIt may unhide files which have been intentionally hidden by the OS (but this shouldn't cause any harm).\nPS: man chflags has all the details.\n\nA: @nohillside's answer is correct if the cause is that the unix hidden flag has been set. But there are other potential causes. Here is an answer that should be read in addition to @nohillside's answer.\nmacOS sets extended file attributes (xattr) on files. These include an attribute com.apple.FinderInfo which is used by Finder. It can be shown with:\nxattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo <file> where the <file> is replaced by a file name and extension.\nIf the xattr is present it is 32 bytes long and displayed in hexadecimal, like this. Here is an example for a file called culinary.docx (it just happens to be on my Desktop):\n% xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo culinary.docx\n57 58 42 4E 4D 53 57 44 40 10 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\nThe bit represented by the 4 in the 9th byte (40) is the hidden or invisible bit.\nThe format of com.appleFinderInfo can be found in this header file Carbon Headers. Look for kIsInvisible. I will call it the \"inVisible\" bit.\nOne method of clearing the inVisible bit is to delete all extended attributes, like this:\nxattr -c <file>\nor to do it recursively:\nxattr -cr <folder>\nBut this is somewhat drastic and will, for example, remove the kIsAlias bit so that any aliases will no longer work! I am not sure what else.\nThere is a better method. It requires that you install the Xcode Command Line Tools. If you don't have these, you can install with: xcode-select –-install\nYou will then have the command GetFileInfo and SetFile (note the capitalisation). Please read the help pages man GetFileInfo and man SetFile. Here is an example:\n% GetFileInfo -a culinary.docx\naVbstclinmEdz\n\nThe V indicates that the inVisible bit is set. In general the capitals are set bits.  We can clear the inVisible with SetFile like this:\n% SetFile -a v culinary.docx\n% GetFileInfo -a culinary.docx\navbstclinmEdz\n\nNow the inVisible bit is a small v and that indicates that it is not set.\nCombine this with a find command and we can clear the inVisible bit for all files and folders in Desktop with:\nfind ~/Desktop -exec SetFile -a v {} \\;\nAfter running that all files and folders will be visible in Finder.

I currently have two external monitors hooked up to my Macbook pro.  One is connected using an HDMI -> USB-C cable and the other is plugged into a USB-C Hub that has a number of ports including an HDMI port which my second monitor is plugged into. With this setup any time I want to hook up my external monitors I have to plug in both the HDMI -> USB-C cable and the hub that the HDMI -> HDMI cable is plugged into.\nWhat I'm wondering is if there is any way that I could connect both of my monitors through a single USB-C port on my MacBook rather than using two ports?  I've done quite a bit of Googling/Amazoning looking for USB-C hubs but the majority of what comes up includes at most 1 USB-C input. I did find one that had two USB-C ports but it specifically said it wasn't for video.\nIs there any way to connect both of my external displays through a single USB-C port on my MacBook or am I destined use two ports every time?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this using a Thunderbolt dock. It won't work with a USB-C hub/dock.\nLots of these docks are available on the market. For example the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock, the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock, the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock, and the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Pro.\n\nA: If you have a M1 MacBook then there is no one cable solution to two displays.  It's a limitation of the hardware, no Thunderbolt dock will fix this.  Belkin explains this in their support documents.  https://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=317939\nThere are docks that will support two displays on M1 Macs by using a USB based GPU.  Because it is a separate GPU it will act differently in some situations than the native GPU.  Because it's using USB the performance is limited.  Because the dock will have another GPU it's going to cost more than a dock with a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter chip.\nIf you have an Intel MacBook then @jksoegaard has the answer, find a Thunderbolt dock that supports two displays.\n\nA: You need a KVM switch, so you don't need to do any plug and unplug of any cables while you decide to make a switch between your MBP and other systems.\nThe way you're planning to do (using a type-C with dual video outputs) will not work at all.\n", "Q: Chrome on macOS fullscreen shortcut unexpectedly changed I know for sure I didn't change it but somehow my Chrome browser's shortcut to enter or exit fullscreen mode has been changed to this combo (instead of Ctrl+Cmd+F).\n\nI've looked and found some answers but I don't want to set a custom keyboard shortcut like the answers suggested.

I had a 2013 MBP Retina that I have been doing regular Time Machine backups to an external hard drive.

So that should not be the issue.\n\nA: Don't use ~ in your PATH. It's a shell shorthand for your home directory, but it won't work in a lot of other cases. The cases where it does work properly are those where the shell expands it into the full path to your home directory before it's actually used. Also, don't put a / at the end of a PATH entry.\nSo this is ok, because the shell will expand it before it's added to PATH:\nPATH=\"$PATH\":~/bin\n\nThe shell will expand the ~ to something like /Users/stochastik3, and that'll be added to the PATH variable. But if you use this:\nPATH=\"$PATH:~/bin\"    # Don't do this\n\nThe ~ is inside double-quotes, so it won't expand properly.\nNow, the reason that it works in bash is that bash does its own PATH interpretation, and it does expand ~ when it finds it in PATH. But nothing else does. zsh doesn't, ksh doesn't, and probably more importantly the OS doesn't, so a PATH entry with ~ won't be recognized in a find ... -exec, or sudo, or env, or... anything other than directly in bash.\n", "Q: Downloading Windows 10 64bit Boot Camp Drivers on M1 Mac I'm trying to find the 64bit drivers for Boot Camp.

I buy a cable from Amazon that says it’s MacBook Pro compatible and it doesn’t work. In fact, I plug that cable into my Apple power brick and it also fails to power the laptop cooler. I try to buy several more, fast charging compatible, different brands including Anker and they all fail to power the laptop cooler. The same results when I try to plug into other Mac laptop models (m1 16” MBP, 12” MacBook, 2012 15” MacBook Pro, etc) so it doesn’t seem to be a laptop port or model/year problem.\nIs there a USB-C to USB-A cable specification I should be looking for? The only thing I haven’t tried is the ones that are PD charging compatible which I may try next.\n\nA: Did the laptop cooler have a USB-A port as a means to supply power to it?  Did the laptop cooler come with a cable that had male USB-A connectors on both ends to supply power?  If so then you should be thankful no damage was done to any of your hardware then destroy this laptop cooler and it's power cable as it is a fire hazard.\nAllow me to explain...\nUSB is a port that is used to supply power to devices as well as exchange data with them.  This power flow specification is such that power is to only flow out of a USB female port (like that on a computer) and into a USB male plug.  Violating this is like having a computer that instead of a standard three pin IEC C14 connector like most computers it had a NEMA 5-15R, like an outlet on a wall would.  This is using a connector designed only for power output for power input.  To make this work they had to include a cable with a standard electrical plug, like one would see on any home appliance, on both ends.  Someone might not realize what this cord is for and plug in two outlets together.  In many cases nothing happens because both outlets would be fed off the same electrical phase.  In some cases this would be short circuiting a 240 volt AC supply capable of 15 amps before the circuit breaker tripped.  This short circuit would mean a lot of current flowing, admittedly in a short time if the circuit breakers worked like they should, but not without doing some damage to the cord and at least one outlet.\nThe cord that came with this cooling pad is doing much the same thing.  It would potentially short circuit two power output ports capable of supplying potentially 20 amps.  There will be circuit breakers but they are not likely to stop the current flow fast enough to prevent damage.  This cable needs to go.  Because the cooling pad would only work with unsafe cables then it too must go.\nYou are not likely to find a cable with male USB-A on one end and a male USB-C on the other end to work in supplying power to this cooling pad.  For power to flow from a USB-C port into a cable with a male USB-A connector on the other end would violate the USB specification.  There's some very simple circuitry in the cable to prevent this.\nDuring the development of the USB-PD version 1.0 spec there may have been a means to make power flow into a USB-A port safely.  Maybe, most likely not, it's hard to find the spec any more since it was not widely adopted, possibly not adopted at all as I have seen nothing that supports USB-PD v1.0.  USB-PD v2.0 and later quietly dropped USB-PD on USB-A ports, leaving USB-A ports as being specified to only supply power.\nMaybe, possibly, the cooling pad and cable are doing things safely.  Perhaps they built a cable that will not supply power until conditions are met and therefore supply power safely.  That's not likely since a far less expensive means to get a safe connection was to use USB-B, USB-C, or some other connector.\nIf they cheaped out in such an obvious way, in blatant violation of a very important specification on safety, they likely violated the spec in ways that are not so obvious.  Perhaps by taking far more power from the USB host than is allowed.  Most computers are able to hold up to power draw beyond the spec without damage.  That's playing with fire, perhaps literally, and could damage hardware.\nI made this long explanation to hopefully make it clear on what the problem is and that the best course of action I see is to destroy this cable and cooling pad.  It's quite possible I am making the wrong assumptions and your cooling pad is adhering to the spec.  If that were so then it should work with any cable that also adheres to the spec.  It's also possible is was built to the USB spec but is now broken.  If you have a broken laptop cooler then we get back to tossing it out as a solution.  Perhaps it can be repaired but that is not likely worth the trouble as I suspect this cooling pad was not a large investment.\nFor a cable with male USB-A on one end and male USB-C on the other to supply power to anything, as in the spec, then the USB-A end must be connected to the laptop and the USB-C end to the laptop cooler.  From your description that does not appear to be the case.\nPlease clarify what ports are on the cooling pad, if it is as I suspect then the cooling pad was made broken and the only fix is to toss it out and replace it with a device that meets the spec.  If this cooling pad is safely made then consider my answer a warning to all on paying attention to the ports on your USB devices.  There are far too many that don't adhere to the spec.  It's silly to try to save $10 on a USB device when it could damage a far more expensive laptop because the cables were not up to spec.\n", "Q: My Mac suddenly no longer able to resolve DNS address when connecting to WIFI, but still able to ping to physical address. Why? I am usually able to connect to Wifi or iPhone USB tethering and browse the internet with no problem. But one day, I'm unable to browse using a Wifi connection. When I try to ping, I'm able to ping to 8.8.8.8, but I'm unable to ping to www.google.com. I tried to resolve using:\n\n*\n\n*nslookup www.google.com 8.8.8.8\n\n*dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com\n\n*sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nAll has no result. How can I resolve this?\n\nA: Turns out the problem was because I uncheck the option \"Disable unless needed\" on the iPhone USB connection tethering. I unchecked that because sometimes the iPhone connection gets unstable and I notice the Mac tries to connect to local Wifi instead to find better connection. I want Mac to stay connected using iPhone USB connection. But turns out unchecking this option cause my Mac to stop able to resolve DNS. I have asked this in another Stack Exchange network (I forgot which one) but nobody able to resolve this issue. So I posted it here hoping to help people who might stuck with the same issue in the future.\n\nThe box should stay \"checked\". Do not uncheck/untick this box.\n", "Q: Parallels on macOS - Performance & Other technical questions I have a few questions about Parallels that I would like answered before I buy a Mac. This info is critical for me to know, since Macs are the only computers that have the least flaws, at least for me. Bulky Windows laptops with 13 minutes of battery life are just not suitable for me anymore. So I need to know if macOS running on M1 Max + Parallels is a good solution. (\"Good solution\" as in optimal for hardcore gaming, running Microsoft Access with gigantic databases, GPU-accelerated AI software, developing C++ software for Windows through the Windows API, etc). Assume that I have the maximum possible specs (64GB RAM, 8TB SSD, M1 Max, you get the picture)\nI have researched dozens of threads and websites belonging to Parallels, but no clear answer has been given. I cannot contact support because my parents don’t want me making an account on the Parallels website until the time comes when I have to buy it (for some strange reason). I read that Parallels tells Windows that it’s running on virtual hardware to stop it from doing the TPM 2 check. But if Windows 11 really needs DirectX 12, then how the heck is Parallels even booting up the VM? Or is this DirectX 12 requirement just there so people will buy more hardware and Microsoft will make more money?\nQuestion 1: What architecture is a Windows VM running in Parallels? That is, does Parallels emulate x64 Windows or ARM64 Windows?\nQuestion 2: Do Parallels graphics that are natively supported by Macs (such as OpenGL versions up to 4.1) get drawn on the physical GPU or on an emulated one?\nQuestion 3: Does Parallels support DirectX 12? If so, does it support some sort of Nvidia RTX emulation?\nQuestion 4: If Parallels emulates a GPU, does it get emulated on the physical CPU or using some sort of compute API on the physical GPU?\nQuestion 5: How is the overall snappiness of a Parallels VM?\nI want answers like “yeah sure you can do that, but this is impossible”\nIf anyone owns a Parallels license and would kindly answer my questions, it would be awesome. Thanks in advance. Stay safe.\n\nA: I am a Windows sysadmin, so my workload is very similar to yours. I use Parallels on a 2019 iMac and a 2020 MacBook Pro all the time and I love it. But full disclosure — they’re both Intel. The only M1 Macs I have access to don’t belong to me, so I haven’t been able to run them through their paces.  Unfortunately, from my limited experience and what I read, most of what you want to do is no longer possible on M1 Macs.\nFirst of all, Parallels can only run ARM-based versions of Windows 10 and 11. Running x86/x64 programs in Windows goes through Microsoft’s translation layer inside the VM, which sadly is not as good as Apple’s. Access, Visual Studio, and ArcGIS run acceptably well as far as I can tell, but until the Windows ecosystem sees more ARM-native applications, I no longer see Parallels as a viable option going forward.\nGaming was always a mixed bag with Parallels even on Intel Macs. Parallels does not have access to the graphics hardware directly (no Mac application does), so it has to dynamically re-package DirectX andOpenGL calls into Apple’s Metal API. It’s still GPU accelerated, but Parallels is forced to use main system memory for the translation rather than the GPU’s video RAM, which causes a pretty significant performance hit.\nThat being said, it’s very good on Intel. Beefy applications like SolidWorks run impressively well.  No other virtualization platform even comes close. But you can definitely tell it’s slower than native performance. I personally switch over to my Boot Camp partition when I want play most games.\nBut gaming with x86 emulation on Windows ARM in a Parallels VM on an M1 Mac? That’s out of the question.  As for GPU-accelerated AI, I can’t really speak to that but that’s probably not doable either.\nBy the way, DirectX 11 is as high as Parallels goes, so even on an Intel Mac you won’t be able to run DX12.\n", "Q: Date is wrong by months when set to automatic on 12.1 Monterey (MacBook Pro 14) Upon booting up by machine (2021 MacBook Pro 14 on 12.1) after fully running out of battery for the first time (I've owned the machine for a couple months) I noticed the date and time were completely wrong by a number of months.

On the airplane they have a stereo 3.5mm audio output which normally is where you connect your headphones. Problem is I switched to Apple AirPods a while ago and they’re wireless. What’s the best way to connect my AirPods to a physical jack, and how do I do it?\nI’m hoping there’s a way to leverage the iPhone as the bridge between the physical connection and the wireless one rather than needing a new device:\n\n*\n\n*3.5mm stereo female (audio source)\n\n*3.5mm stereo male to male cable\n\n*3.5mm stereo female (microphone slot) to 3.5mm TRRS male cable\n\n*3.5mm TRRS female to Lightning male adapter\n\n*iPhone\n\n*AirPods (audio destination)\n\nA few assumptions/unknowns here:\n\n*\n\n*I included the conversion to TRRS since that seems to be the only way to convert the audio output into audio input to the iPhone.\n\n*Once the audio input comes in to the phone, I’d need a way to replay it on the AirPods. I’m not sure how to do that.\n\n*At the same time, I’d need to make sure whatever audio the AirPods microphones pick up is ignored in this replay mechanism.\n\nIs all of this possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: You are very much overthinking this, it is an already solved problem.\nUse a stereo-to-bluetooth adapter, don't try to leverage the phone.\nOne such is https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Transmitter-Headphones-Airplanes/dp/B07Z13G1P5\n", "Q: Does the Lightning port on the Lightning to VGA Adapter have the ability to transmit data? The Lightning port on the Lightning to VGA Adapter is used for charging while mirroring.\nI want to know if this Lightning port has the ability to transmit data? For example, plug a Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter into that port, then connect an earphone through this jack adapter. Will the earphone work?\n\nA: No - there is not a “lightning hub” or data splitter in that adapter. It functions with signaling limited to negotiate the charge rate only from a power source. That is “data” but not something you could use as an audio out option.\nBoth screen data and audio data work wirelessly, so you would have choose one to be wired and the other wireless.\nIn your case with VGA, I would look for a Bluetooth DAC or Bluetooth Amplifier. They run about $30 in the US for decent reliability and cost with an included battery to run the amp.\n", "Q: Python 3.9 does not find packages that work with Python 3.8 I have a hard time understanding how Python is installed on my Mac. Not sure if it is important, but I have a Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro chip and come from years of using Linux with a package-manager and thus mostly use iTerm 2 together with brew to manage my installations.\nWhen I open up iTerm and enter the command python3 I am greeted with\n❯ python3\nPython 3.8.9 (default, Oct 26 2021, 07:25:53)\n[Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> \n\nI can import packages that I have installed with pip3.

I'm hesitant to remove any versions of python because I know that macOS depends on some of them... Could somebody shed some light on what is going on here and how I can set the newest version as the default version and get it to recognize the installed packages?\n\nA: You have two separate installations of python3 and they know nothing of each other,\nOne from Apple the original in /usr/bin/python3 the  3.8.9 version\nThe other via Homebrew (I suspect in /opt/homebrew/python3) the 3.9.9\nThey know nothing of each other.\npip3 is a script file that is related to the python version it works with - the first line of pip3 is #!<path>/python3\nTo use the newer homebrew version you need pip3 from Homebrew and then uses that pip3 to install the python packages you installed for the Apple version.\nThe version of python (and pip) you end up using is the version that is first on your $PATH - see which python3 so see what the shell thinks\nIf you really want to use python you should also look at the official python way of using multiple python versions and package versions - venv https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\n\nA: Because each of them has their own site-packages directory.  It's how Python works, after all.  They don't share.\nThe Python 3.8.9 you have installed is the one provided by Apple through the CLT.\nThe Python 3.9.9 you have installed is the one from Homebrew.  If you want to install packages in it, do so.\nHomebrew probably has some broken method to override python3.\n", "Q: With an iPhone 13 pro, is it possible to record video and lidar simultaneously?

If it can't be done natively, is there an app that can do that?\n\nA: See the example Enhancing Live Video by Leveraging TrueDepth Camera Data. LIDAR and the camera can be set up independently.

Can I set up a faster method of opening an audio recorder? Or can I make the QuickTime Player experience less painful (for example by disabling the automatic Open dialog)\n\nA: From Mojave onwards, MacOS comes with a Voice Memos app, which may be faster and better-suited to your purpose.\nCommand N (or press the red button) will start a new recording.\nYou can also sync the recording using iCloud, if you want.\nAlternatively, from Monterey onwards, you could use Shortcuts.app to create a Shortcut that records audio.

You can also export files in different formats and save them under different names. I had a similar situation, and only it took me less time to create the document because I worked with a program I downloaded from https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/resources/excel/study/index-match-formula-excel.

Also, you can see that the manual for who was last updated nearly 15 years ago: January 17, 2007 on my system.\nThe reason that runlevel was meaningless on Mac OS X, and is still meaningless today is that macOS & its predecessors have for years used launchd in lieu of the init system; init has run levels, but launchd does not.\nYou may wonder, \"If who reports run level, and macOS systems do not have run levels, why is it included in macOS?\" Or, \"Why doesn't Apple modify the code to eliminate that confusion?\"\nOnly Apple can answer those questions. However, from the historical record, we know Apple chose to use Darwin in their systems since ca. Steve Jobs' return to Apple, and we know that Darwin is built partly on the Unix BSD code base. That doesn't even begin to answer why the code remains essentially un-modified over all these years, but at least it explains how it got there in the first place.\n", "Q: Change Mapping for F6 key on Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and Numeric Keypad I've just replaced the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad with the newer Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and Numeric Keypad to use with a new MacBook Pro M1.

My Mac runs a daily script (via cron) that mounts an AFP network share on a remote server, writes to it, and unmounts the share. Unfortunately, the script has a side-effect of opening a Finder window to view the network share, which pops up in the middle of the user's day, interrupting their work.

In this case Finder.\nYou need the mount command. Try:\nmkdir MyVolumeName\nmount_afp afp://username:pw@server.com/MyVolumeName myVolumeName\n\nYou don't need the mkdir if the mount point already exists as an empty folder.

I was unable to figure out how to fix this from DMDE, but was able to fix it from TestDisk.\nReran Repair Disk in Disk Utility. This was not successful.\nTried running it from diskutil (The commandline version of Disk Utility) was not successful.\nUsed hfs.util to remove the journal.\nTwo more passes with fsck_hfs cleared the fussing about corrupted journal.  Interesting note:  The last pass fsck started talking about corrupted journal, even though hfs.util had successfully removed journal, but when finished, reran itself without the notice.\nSo initially there was some remnant of journal data that triggered fsck thinking it was still journaled.\nOnce it was cleared, the drive mounted without a problem.  I re-enabled journalling, and it's been running flawlessly as my Time Machine backup ever since.\nLinks:\nDMDE: https://dmde.com/\nNote that the free version has full partion management capability. Even reading the manual I do not yet understand how to fix a partition entry other than by deleting and recreating.\nTestDisk:  https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download\nThis is more general partition utility.  It is a terminal app, running in character mode and is a bit quirky in the way commands work.\nIt seemed to read the partition table fine, so I wrote it back.  At that point my \"disk unrecognized\" became a greyed out version of my disk name.

On a 2017 MacBook Pro 15\", I want symmetry in my three modifier keys (ctrl, option, cmd), i.e. what's available to my right hand would be mirror-symmetrical to what's available to my left. The best way to achieve this would be if I could remap the left-arrow (←) key to ctrl.  Left-arrow sits directly in line with my right pinky and I don't use it.  Is this possible in iTerm (or another emulator), or at the MacOS level?\n(I know for sure that remapping at the emulator level is desirable to me.  I'm not as sure that I never use the arrow keys in MacOS more broadly, but I'm sure enough to try it.)\nI've seen a lot about remapping keys, but so far only that modifiers can be remapped to other modifiers, and other keys to other keys or macros.  Since left-arrow (←) isn't already a modifier, I don't see how to make it serve as ctrl.  Or is there hardware or firmware standing in the way?\n\nA: After further digging, and also (for a different keyboard situation) looking into remapping the fn key for similar reasons, I've concluded that this is probably not possible without at least extra software and perhaps a firmware mod.\nThis post on Super User was helpful: https://superuser.com/questions/65/remap-fn-to-another-key\n\nA: You can use hidutil to do this system-wide.\nLeft arrow to control is\n/usr/bin/hidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{ \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0x700000050, \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x7000000E4}]}'\n\n\nA: You can use Karabiner Elements to remap keys on macOS.\n", "Q: How to Auto-switch Text-to-speech Voices on basis of language tags in text Is anyone aware of a TTS system for Mac which will automatically switch voices on the basis of language tags present in word processing or html text?  For example, it would switch to a French voice to correctly pronounce a French word or text run in a longer English text.\nI'm looking for an extension or service that could speak a web page or email text coded like\n<span lang=\"en-US\">In Paris the name of the city is pronounced</span> <span lang=\"fr-FR\">Paris</span>\n\nand switch from an English to a French voice for the last word.\nIt doesn't appear that Apple's own text-to-speech system will do this, voices normally have to be changed by the user (except possibly when the languages are in different scripts, like English and Hebrew).\nI have found one app, Ghostreader +, which does the voice switching, but it requires using the app to add its own language tags and docs are saved in its own non-standard format.  Something which works with tags already present for example in html would be a lot more useful.\n\nA: You can create your own swift binary and use it in Automator. Here's the example code:\nimport Foundation\nimport AVFoundation\n\nclass Synth: NSObject, AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate {\n    let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()\n\n    init(text: String) {\n        super.init()\n        let languageCode = NSLinguisticTagger.dominantLanguage(for: text) ??

Make it run on text input. Place \"Run shell script\" as a first block and input:\n~/ttslanguage \"$1\"\n\nNow You'll be able to run Text To Speech that detects the language in selected text.\nIf the text has multuple sentences with different languages you can change the Synth class to (don't forget to import NaturalLanguage):\nclass Synth: NSObject, AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate {\n    let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()\n    var lastUtterance: AVSpeechUtterance?\n\n    init(text: String) {\n        super.init()\n        let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.language])\n        tagger.string = text\n        var utterances = [AVSpeechUtterance]()\n        tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..<text.endIndex, unit: .sentence, scheme: .language, options: []) { tag, tokenRange in\n                let txt = String(text[tokenRange])\n                let languageCode = NSLinguisticTagger.dominantLanguage(for: txt) ??

You go to a crowded location, like a bar.  A bad actor, with an iPhone, gets an alert about an unknown AirTag in the vicinity and decides to add your AirTag to their device.  Later the bad actor uses the AirTag to locate your home and perpetrate a crime.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to identify how many devices are registered to an AirTag?  I don't see anything in \"Find My\" about this.\n\n*Is there a mechanism to lock the AirTag's registration to prevent unauthorized registration?\n\n*When a second device in my home registered my AirTag, an alert wasn't sent to me. Shouldn't there have been one?\n\n\nA: Airtag's don't work that way: Others are not alerted to your Airtag immediately or likely at all, since it is with you. And no one can register your Airtag until you de-register it.\nAirtag's are registered to an AppleID, not an item. Once registered, they can't be registered to another AppleID, unless the previous registration is removed by that owner. If by 'devices' you mean info on what iPhone has registered the Airtag, this information is private and not revealed. So you will see no information in 'Find My' about the iPhone or owner of the iPhone, only whatever name was given to the Airtag. (You will see location of course).\nWhen an Airtag is found, the finder can not 'register' that Airtag. They can touch the Airtag with their iPhone and a webpage will provide them with the ability to send a message to the Airtag owner if it has been lost.\nAirtags do not alert others of their presence immediately. They must be away from the owner and moving with the non-owner for a 'period of time\". Apple's support page tells us that:\n\nTo discourage tracking without your knowledge, Find My will notify you if an unknown AirTag or other Find My network accessory is seen moving with you over time. An AirTag that isn't with the person who registered it for an extended period of time will also play a sound when moved so you can find it, even if you don’t use an iOS device.\n\nFinally, since you register an Airtag with your AppleID, any 'devices' that are also signed into your AppleID will be able to see and control that Airtag. For example, our Mac, or iPad. You don't get an alert because those devices share your AppleID, so it knows its 'you'.\n", "Q: Cannot trigger an applescript by ssh to a network mac I face a vexing problem on my home set-up involving a Server mac advising a Client mac that a task (a back-up task) was successfully implemented.

I checked them in my browser (Firefox) on MacOS 10.14, and since on one of them I found a few changes to be done, I fired up my text editor and modified that file. After saving it, I tried to reload it, but Firefox refused now to show it and said that it has no permission to open this file.\nI checked the file from the command line, and found that I could display the file using\nless /Volume/Stick/original/x.html\n\nfine and my changes were also present. I tried to restart Firefox, and even restarted the Mac itself, to no avail. Other browsers (Vivaldi, Chrome) also could not open the file. Looking at that directory /Volume/Stick/original using Finder, I saw that Finder could display a preview of all other files (y.html, z.html), but not of x.html I had modified.\nNext I did a\nls -l /Volume/Stick/original\n\nand found that all the \"working\" files (y, z, ...) showed their permissions as rwxrwxrwx (the unnecessary x-bit perhaps an artefact from the fact that the files were created on Windows), but the file x.html showed the permissions as rwxrwxrwx@. AFIK, the @ would indicate that the directory entry is in reality a link, but ls did not show where it would be linked to. Doing a stat of this file also did not provide more insight.\nFor experimenting a bit, I did a\nmkdir /Volume/Stick/copy \ncp -v /Volume/Stick/original/* /Volume/Stick/copy \n\nthereby creating a copy of those files. A\nls -l /Volume/Stick/copy/x.html\n\nalso showed the @ in the permissions in the copied file. However the copied version, copy/x.html can be opened from any browser without problems, even the original/x.html can not. Even after redundantly copying back the broken file with\ncp -v /Volume/Stick/copy/x.html /Volume/Stick/original\n\nthe version from original/x.html was unusable in the same way as before.\nOf course I now do have a fully working version in /Volume/Stick/copy, but I still would like to understand what has happened here, and why editing the file ruined the file, although a copy of that edited file does not have any problems.\nMy best guess is that the problem is somehow related to the fact that FAT32  basically maintains files according to the infamous 8.3 naming scheme from MSDOS, and some shadow entry is used to store the \"real\" filename; but I don't see how this could explain the behaviour I experienced, because I never so far had problems when creating files on a USB stick on the Mac.\nAny ideas, how to explain the mystery?\nUPDATE:\nFollowing the comment given by gidds, who pointed out the the @ does not indicate a symlink here, but an extended attribute, I applied a ls -l@ to both files (the non-working original, and the working copy). In both cases, the output was\ncom.apple.lastuseddate#PS     16\n\nProbably that lastuseddate was set when I edited the file. I then did an xattr -p for this attribute, and both of them showed\n69 FE DA 61 00 00 00 00 F0 9F C2 33 00 00 00 00\n\nWhile I can't say whether this value is reasonable, but since the same value is shown in both files, it does not explain why one file \"work\" and one of them doesn't.\nFOUND A FIX (but still can't understand it):\nFirst, I found that restarting the Mac solved the problem in so far as the file can't be processed afterwards by all browsers, and also the preview in Finder looks OK. However, editing the file - or, for that matter, any other file on the USB stick - caused the problem to occur again.\nAfter some experimentation, I found that the problem was tied to a particular text editor. I used the Cot Editor for editing the file, and with this, things get broken if the file is on a USB stick.\nIf, after rebooting, I edited the file using Tincta instead, everything is fine.\nFurther, I noticed that, once I got a broken file with the Cot Editor, I could also fix it by first copying the broken file on the command line to some other, temporary file, then erase the broken file, and finally copying it back from the temp file.\nI don't know what Cot Editor is doing specially with those files, but at one point during my experiments, when I wanted to quit Cot Editor, I got a pop-up message saying: \"The document x.html is on a volume that does not support permanent version storage\". I have seen this message the first time and don't know, what it means, but at least it shows that there is something special about the USB volume which upsets this text editor.\n\nA: First of all, be aware that file permissions do not exist on FAT32 formatted drives. The permissions you see are defined by the way you mounted that drive (read more).\nAs you already found out by yourself, CotEditor is causing the trouble in your case. That's because CotEditor has an auto backup and versioning feature that is probably not compatible to the FAT32 file system:\n\nAuto Backup\nYou don't need to lose your unsaved data anymore. CotEditor backups your documents automatically while editing.\n\nFrom the code, you can read this about the Auto Save with Versions feature:\n\nAutomatically save documents to your file constantly while editing. This option also enables Versions, the modern system feature allowing you to go back to previous versions, as well as modifying document name or location from the window title bar.\nEven if it turned off, CotEditor creates backup covertly for unexpected crash.\n\nSo unfortunately, you cannot disable the behaviour that causes you trouble. But you are not alone, and may be it gets fixed/changed in the future.\nThe problem with FAT32 might be related to this function which tries to write metadata, which is not supported in FAT32 file systems (except filename and timestamps). And this function will not work, because you don't have real file permissions here. You just have the file permissions of the mount, which cannot be altered dynamically.\n\nA: My guess is that the issue is being caused by the Cot Editor not releasing whatever type of file lock it's establishing on the files that it opens from the FAT32-formatted volume.\nGenerally, when a program opens a file with exclusive access (i.e., when it locks the file), it should also release that lock after the file is closed (or saved) - which probably isn't happening in this scenario.\nSince restarting the computer resolves the issue, a temporary file lock not getting released seems to be the most logical reason for this occurring (since all file locks are released when the system starts up). Additionally, a copy of that file wouldn't have a file lock held on it (since it's a copy, and not the file that was being edited by Cot Editor), which also points at some temporary file lock.\nI'm not sure of a way to display a list of all files that have a file lock held within current versions of macOS. It may be possible to use lsof to see some of the processes that are locking files (e.g., sudo lsof | grep 'x\\.html'). However, this may not work in all situations (e.g., like the one where the Cot Editor process is no longer running but hasn't released the lock). I believe that file locking information is held within kernel-space memory, and that no other processes have access to it. More info about how file locking is implemented in macOS might be available on the XNU kernel's GitHub page for fcntl.\nAlternately: as you mention, the @ character showing in the permissions listing in Terminal indicates that the file has extended attributes set. It's also possible that one of those attributes is the system immutable (schg) or user immutable (uchg) bit. Using the chflags command (e.g., chflags nouchg x.html or chflags noschg x.html) might allow you 'unlock' the files that Cot Editor has left un-mutable (this probably isn't going to help based on the reasoning suggested above).\nIf other apps are able to edit those files normally, it's possible that there is some kind of FAT32 file editing bug that exists with the Cot Editor app (i.e., if it works normally on volumes formatted with APFS or HFS+?), which the developer of the software might be able to rectify.\n", "Q: Can I set a default \"lights\" per device in the Home app so that controlling the lights is more like on Star Trek (TNG)? I use a few old phones permanently installed in different rooms with \"Hey Siri\" enabled.  I have one home device whose name is just \"lights\" for the living room lights.  It's the one I use the most and I used to be able to say \"Hey Siri, turn on the lights\" (albeit to any device and from anywhere in my house) and the living room lights would turn on.  Every other device was specified by room.  It was effectively a global default for \"lights\".\nAt some point, via updates or settings changes, Siri started responding \"which light\" and show me a list of all my lights.  If I don't select one, it turns on every light in (and outside of) my house.  So now I have to modify my command the specify \"Hey Siri, turn on the living room lights\" (or respond to the clarifying query).\nI think I may be able to restore the original behavior by classifying all my lights as outlets, but I just had the idea:\nIs there a way to set a default \"lights\" per device?  If so, I could:\n\n*\n\n*Set the old iPhone in the living room to turn on the living room lights when I say \"Hey Siri, turn on the lights\"\n\n*Set the old iPhone in the bedroom to turn on the bedroom lights when I say \"Hey Siri, turn on the lights\"\n\n... etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*In the Shortcuts app, create a shortcut.\n\n*Add a single action to it to ‘Control <House Name>’ and turn on your desired light(s).\n\n*Title the shortcut exactly \"Turn on the lights\".\n\nNow ‘Hey Siri, turn on the lights’ will run your shortcut, bypassing the default Home behaviour.\nShortcuts sync across iCloud devices so your new command will be available everywhere (you might have to open the Shortcuts app once for it to be aware). If you want to use the same shortcut everywhere but do something different, you can use the Get Device Details action and switch on something identifiable per device, e.g. Device Name:\n\n", "Q: Turn off iOS Camera Night Mode by default? iOS Camera added the impressive Night Mode in iOS 13 on the iPhone 11:\n\nTake low-light photos with Night mode\nNight mode automatically turns on when the camera detects a low-light environment.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211306\n\nHowever, I really don't like how Night Mode prevents Live Photos from being shot.

In general, this is a very useful feature. However, there are scenarios, where I want to - at least temporarily - disable this. For example when I'm recording my screen for a video and I don't want that orange dot to pollute my entire video. I'm perfectly fine with the security implications, but it would be great if there was a way to disable this feature (at least temporarily) through some mechanism.\nIs there any way to achieve this? I don't care if I have to sudo-script some stuff, I just want to get rid of this annoying orange dot while recording my screen. Unfortunately, the built-in screenshot app is not intelligent enough to hide this indicator for me.\n\n\nA: As far as I know the only official way to disable this feature is for an app on your Mac to capture* the display which will prevent other software (including the operating system) from drawing anything to it.\nThat's how, for example, live event software should send video/etc to a projector. Unfortunately not all software captures the display - this should be reported to the developer as a bug.\nAs a temporary workaround until the developer makes that change, you can probably crop the video output.

When I searched how to do this the answer which seemed most appropriate for me was to run the commands I needed to run with root privileges in AppleScript using \"with administrator privileges\" after the shell script I wanted to run. This accomplished what I needed to do, but in general I would prefer not to have to use AppleScript when I want to run a few commands in the shell.\nTherefore, I was wondering what the shell version of \"with administrator privileges\" is that would work for my mac. I am looking for something that would provide me with not only sudo privileges but root privileges as well. I would prefer it if I could do this in a way that was \"sh-compatible\" so it would work on zsh, bash, etc. But, I would also accept a solution that only works with zsh (my interactive shell of choice) if there is not a good \"sh-compatible\" solution for me.\nI understand that I can run AppleScripts in the terminal using osascript in a similar vein as the solution provided in How to open a shell script in a new Terminal window and run it with administrator privileges but I was hoping for a more \"pure sh\" solution if possible.\n\nA: Apple never had the windows security model of admin scripts so there is less effectiveness of the similar command in my experience. Your research was good, but the effect is underwhelming.\nSince unix and Apple defense is layered and more about access control lists, you may need to attack each specific problem and apply the appropriate user or change needed. Instead of group policy and “as admin” Apple implemented MDM commands and the concept of a managed system.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/apple-device-enrollment-types-and-mdm-dep23db2037d/web\nHowever, if you are lucky your problem may be amenable to “as admin”.

The only down side would be objective-c bindings and native GUI script ability that Automator and AppleScript allow.\n\nA: sudo is the command-line equivalent of AppleScript's with administrator privileges. That is, when you run sudo somecommand, then somecommand will run as root. Here's a quick demo:\n$ sudo whoami\nPassword: [I entered my password here]\nroot\n\nOne thing you have to be aware of, though, is that sudo only runs the actual command as root, not things like redirections. So if you use something like this:\nsudo somecommand <inputfile >outputfile\n\n...opening inputfile and outputfile will be done by your current shell, as the current user, before sudo and the command run. There are standard ways to get around this, like running a root shell to do the redirections and run the command:\nsudo sh -c 'somecommand <inputfile >outputfile'\n\n(Warning: if the command you want to run contains single-quotes and/or any shell variables, things are more complicated.) Another standard trick is to use sudo cat to read files as root and/or sudo tee to write files as root:\nsudo cat inputfile | somecommand | sudo tee outputfile >/dev/null\n\n(Note that in this example, cat and tee are run as root, but somecommand runs as your normal user.)\nYou can also use sudo -s to open an interactive root shell, and then run a bunch of commands as root (and then use exit to close that shell and go back to normal). But be careful when running as root; it's fairly easy to make a complete mess if you don't know exactly what you're doing.\n", "Q: macos Catalina \"Cannot connect to app store\" popup I see this general issue has been asked about a number of times, but none of them appear to be exactly the same as in my case.

Due to a bug in Monterey, TextEdit quarantines any file it changes.  xattr can fix it, and since I didn't know where such might be, I tried to do xattr -rc ~\nBut something in ~/Library prevents that from completing¹, so I tried\nxattr -rc {A..K}* {M..Z}* {a..z}*\nThat failed with the complaint that x* doesn't exist—but it does!  (I created an empty file for every letter of the alphabet to avoid this error.)\nWhen I fix that, it complained about X* but it has no problem globbing a * after any other letter:\nuser@mac ~ % xattr -rc {A..K}* {M..Z}* {a..w}* {y,z}\nzsh: no matches found: X*\nuser@mac ~ % xattr -rc {A..K}* {M..W}* {Y,Z}* {a..w}* {y,z}\nxattr: No such file: Bible/002_John_1,1-18,nl,HTB.txt\n\n(Second error is because of a bad symlink)\nWhat is special about X* that disables globbing?\nUpdate: I am aware of the pros and cons about xattr -rc.  That's not the question.  The same effect is seen with ls -d instead.\n¹Probably a looping circle of symlinks.  I've seen that in some frameworks in /System/Library\n\nA: In general, it is not a good idea to remove all attributes from all files in your home folder, as you're trying to do here.\nThere's nothing special about \"X*\" that disables globbing. As you indicate you have created empty files for other letters, you can simply create one for X as well if this is the method you insist on using. In the Terminal run:\ntouch ~/Xisafile\n\nNote that in ordinary macOS setups, the file system is non-case sensitive. I.e. \"x\" and \"X\" in a file name is considered the same. However when you run xattr like you have done, you need to take case into account.\nNote: I don't think it has actually been established that anything you're experiencing here is in fact due to bugs in Monterey. I think that's jumping to conclusions.\n\nA: The answer is hinted at by jksoegaard: case insensitivity.\nFor every letter except X, there is at least one file or directory that starts with upper case and at least one that starts with lower case.  If X exists, touch x changes it without creating X.  So one was always missing. \n", "Q: How to avoid Any Desk auto start with macos Any desk auto start with mac os, How to avoid this.\n\nA: Try to remove from Login Items but still anydesk start every time,\nJust follow the below steps.\nThis is a solution.\n\n*\n\n*Open AnyDesk.\n\n*Open AnyDesk \"Preference\" from Menu items.\n\n*Select \"Security\" Tab.\n\n*\"Unlock Security Setting\" bottom of the\n\n*Uncheck \"Start AnyDesk on login\" in Unattached Access.\n\nscreenshot.\n\n", "Q: Storage issues and odd volume layout on macOS Monterey new mac user here running Monterey 12.1 (21C52)  and I wanted to know if this Drive/ Volume layout is normal. In the last couple of days I noticed that there was something off about my storage. The numbers that disk utility, system information, storage management and onyx were giving me were not the same.\nIt is not a local snapshot issue, i already got rid of every snapshot.\nSystem information tells me that i have ~90gb free space on my mac while disk utility tells me that its ~70gb,onyx says its <60gb and storage management is more along the lines of ~85gb. I cannot imagine what the issue could be, thats why im going to tackle it down one by one.\nI must also mention that I had an issue with macos big sur which led to me reinstalling macos couple of months ago. There is a chance that it has something to do with all of this but i dont know how, or where i should start fixing the problem.\nFirst of all, is this volume \"layout\" normal?\n\nSecond, my system data since very large. Im coming from windows and i dont know if this is normal.\n\nAnd last but not least is this overly large block of data that i found using disk inventory x that cannot be found.\n\nThanks for any help\n\nA: I don't believe you have any issues and everything looks quite normal. Three major changes have made older tools like Grand Perspective and Disk Inventory less useful.\n\n*\n\n*Snapshots and copy on write mean that files can share space on the disk.\n\n*Sparse files, purgeable files (cloud backed files that serve as \"cache\" can be freed on demand) also make it more complicated when \"file size\" is not necessarily the \"space used on disk\" and when two files use the same space - the tools don't know if the OS has commingled those identical bits or not.\n\n*Increased usage of firmlinks and to a lesser extent hard links.\n\nIn your case - 50 GB of apps, 5 GB of iCloud data and 4 GB of Documents mapt\n3. Firm links and sandboxes and sealed system volumes mean that even tools that try to \"traverse\" one home for user files won't catch application caches, settings, data as easily as before.\nIn the comments, I recommended you use Apple tools or something like DaisyDisk which does classify purgeable space and snapshots apart from the \"user space\" you want to focus on to free space.\n\nOn my Mac with a 256 SSD - you can see at the bottom, 172 GB is free for new files since the purgeable don't need any action if I choose to add more files - they do important work speeding up network calls and also save the SSD wear cycles from erasing cached files that are likely to be used again.\n", "Q: switch back and forth between Chrome windows using Apple Script I'd like to have a script that gets some input on one Chrome window, switches to another Chrome Window to process it, and then returns to the original window.\nI can get the Chrome window title from the original window, process on the second window, but I'm failing to return to the original window.\nthis is the working code to get the Window title:\nmy getCurrentWindowTitle()\n\nmy returnToOriginalWindow()\n\nglobal frontApp, frontAppName, windowTitle\n\nset windowTitle to \"\"\n\non getCurrentWindowTitle()\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set frontApp to first application process whose frontmost is true\n        set frontAppName to name of frontApp\n        tell process frontAppName\n            tell (1st window whose value of attribute \"AXMain\" is true)\n                set windowTitle to value of attribute \"AXTitle\" \n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend getCurrentWindowTitle\n\nAnd this is the code bit which I'm struggling to tweak so I can return to the original window:\non returnToOriginalWindow()\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to set index of window 1 where title contains windowTitle to 1\n    delay 0.05\n    do shell script \"open -a Google\\\\ Chrome\"\nend returnToOriginalWindow\n\n\nAny insights on how to test, develop, fix this are really appreciated.\n\nA: One possible solution: you trim a part of the Window Title name:\n   on returnToOriginalWindow()\n    set the_short_name to characters 1 thru 20 of windowTitle as string\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to set index of window 1 where title contains the_short_name to 1\n    delay 0.05\n    do shell script \"open -a Google\\\\ Chrome\"\nend returnToOriginalWindow\n\n", "Q: How to make usb to shut down Mac Mini I have an old Mac mini and I want to use it as my home server. I don't want to connect any display, keyboard or mouse to it. I will be using it as a wifi router and local server. But I will shut down it sometimes when I go out to keep it safe. Pressing the physical button each time can damage the system, because it is force shutdown. I want to shutdown as usual, but without the mouse,display or keyboard. I think USB is the best solution for it.\nI think I need to create something like a daemon or automator that will detect the USB connection and if the usb name is \"ShutDown\" will call \"shut down\". Please help me to get it right. I am a developer but I have no experience with AppleScripting.\n\nA: This is really quick and dirty, I haven't had the time to test it. Basically, we run a script when something is mounted. It runs anytime, but we use the script to check for the 1 drive we are looking for. You need to run this under a launchd root job to have permissions to shutdown without entering the password.\nThe following is the config file for you to install in /Library/LaunchDaemons.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>PATH</key>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/sbin</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>server.shutdown</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/sh</string>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin/server_shutdown.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>StartOnMount</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou need to go into Terminal and run as root the following to load the\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/server.shutdown\n\nFrom here, you create a new script called server_shutdown.sh in /usr/local/bin and make it executable with chmod +x /usr/local/bin/server_shutdown.sh:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nDIR=\"/Volumes/SHUTDOWN/\"\n\nif [ -d \"$DIR\" ]; then\n  # Take action if $DIR exists. #\n  say \"The computer will shut down now.\"\n  #shutdown -h now\nfi\n\nYou could put a check in there for a restart if you wanted. I put in the say command to give you an audible message. Just erase the # in front of the shutdown command once you see that the script works.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Missing disk space after boot camp assistant failure I was trying to use Boot Camp Assistant to create a Windows 10 partition, but it got stuck at partitioning.

As for other user-level settings there is no admin password required to change them. It is a bit sneaky from Steam to add an entry there without informing/asking the user though.\nFor a lot more ways (including some really sneaky ones) to start applications automatically see https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/.\n", "Q: Can a Time Machine backup be used to undo an OS upgrade? Given an upgrade from Mojave to Catalina:\nCan my Time Machine backup be used to undo the upgrade (i.e, return me to Mojave), if something goes wrong?\n\nA: Yes and no\nThere is not a feature/function in macOS that will roll back patches (updates if you prefer) like can be done in Windows. But a Time Machine backup can indeed in assist you in rolling back to a previous update or upgrade.\nMake sure you have a current backup of the system you want to upgrade. I would also make a USB installer of your current macOS version in the event that you want to roll back your upgrade.\nSee, what happens here, is that if you want to roll back a macOS upgrade, you need to boot from the desired macOS installer, wipe the drive, and reinstall the previous version of macOS. Then you use Time Machine to restore your data, settings and apps.\nThere is no uninstall for updates or upgrades like in some other operating systems. When you update or upgrade macOS there is no going back. So it is vital that you verify that all your current software is compatible with the new version you are updating to before you do the update.\n\nA: Get a big spare drive & make a bootable clone.\nYou cannot guarantee Time Machine will let you revert.\nSee Revert to El Capitan\n", "Q: Other Volumes in Container taking up 2/3 of hard drive My Macbook Pro is completely full and after hours of searching for what files might cause this I came across the \"Other Volumes in Container\" category that's taking up a massive amount of my drive (162.75GB of the 256GB hard drive).\nThis computer was originally my dad's.

Upon launching, the Reverso app spawns two processes - Reverso (the app itself) and the annoying Reverso Helper, which occupies the menu bar with its icon and remains active even after cmd+Q -ing the main app.\nkillall \"Reverso Helper\" does kill the unwanted process while keeping the main program intact. However, if the main app remains open for a dozen of seconds, the Helper process gets spawned again.\nps -o ppid=, -p $(pgrep \"Reverso Helper\") | xargs ps -p tells us that the parent process of both Reverso and Helper is 1 /sbin/launchd, \"the service management framework used by macOS, similar in some ways to systemd on Linux\", which is interfaced through a terminal tool launchctl.\nI studied the launchctl manual rather superficially and looked for the Reverso Job Defenitions files in specified directories, but didn't find any. I didn't want to dig deeper in this direction.\nI feel like I'm missing a more obvious and elegant way to prevent a process with certain name from starting on any Unix-like system, which would be much more useful to know than some macOS-specific stuff. Please, share your ideas.\n\nA: While you could (in theory) wrap the exec() system call to prevent certain paths/names from getting executed, this would be a rather weak protection as any binary can be easily renamed to work around the block.\nWhat might help is to just pause/stop the process by running\nkillall -STOP \"Reverso Helper\"\n\nThe process will stay but will not take any CPU time any longer. The icon in the menu bar will remain visible though.\n", "Q: How to send multichannel PCM audio from a Mac to an AVR receiver with HDMI? I’ve been investigating if (or when) there might be a way to send 12 channels of PCM audio from a Mac to an AVR without the need for a hardware audio interface, and specifically via HDMI. While I’ve yet to be able to test it, what I’ve learned has led me to believe 8 channels may be currently possible, but that things are capped at 8 channels, as is the max sample rate (which I don’t recall, but think I heard it might be 48kHz).\nThat said, I’ve also heard there are updates to Monterey (still in beta perhaps?) that might make 12 channels possible.  (Note: my consideration extends beyond making use of the speaker configuration utility in macOS Audio MIDI Setup. My primary interest is just in the ability to send the 12 channels).\nAdditionally, my understanding is that HDMI 2.1 has added considerable extra bandwidth with the potential to transmit up to 32 channels of PCM (though I’m not sure what the sample-rate-to-track-count ratio is, i.e., when/where the sample potential gets capped relative to track count).\nBut I’m not clear about where the bottleneck(s) currently exist to make use of this potential.\n\n*\n\n*Assuming one has a capable HDMI 2.x port and cable, is there something native to macOS that would prevent such a scenario? If so, is that limitation likely to be addressed in the foreseeable future?\n\n\n*Is what I’m describing already possible and I just don’t know it? Specifically, on Big Sur with a 2019 MacBook Pro?\n\n\n*Clearly, the receiving AVR would need to be able to make use of such a signal, and/or presumably present that many path options in the audio device dialogue in macOS Audio-MIDI setup. And while maybe outside the scope of this site, if anyone has any insight into what would be needed on the AVR end of the equation, I’d be curious to know. Specifically, if an AVR already has an HDMI 2.1 port, could this potential be unlocked with a firmware update on the AVR side of the things?\nIdeal use case:\n\n*\n\n*DAW outputs 12 discrete channels of PCM audio (a 7.1.4 decoded Atmos mix, NOT a Dolby stream) to Core Audio.\n\n*ideally up to at least 96 kHz per channel\n\n*Core Audio sends these 12 signals to an AVR via HDMI\n\n*AVR routes to the speaker array.\n\n*Ideally using a 2019 MacBook Pro, Big Sur, with a TB3 to HDMI 2.x adapter.\n\n*Or if above the above machine and/or OS doesn’t work, but another configuration would, would be curious about that.\n\n*Or some other scenario that might exist whereby the PCM could maybe be embedded into a 12 channel stream (bit rate?) that a modern AVR might be able to make easier use of, again via an HDMI pathway. In this scenario, open to a simple (read: not costing thousands of dollars) “interface” type solution that is virtual and/or hardware-based, to act as a go-between. For example: DAWs PCM signals > virtual audio device and/or physical interface > embedded multichannel audio > HDMI > AVR.\n\nAny insight into any or all of the above considerations would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Check System Information on your Mac by going to the Apple menu, select About this Mac, then click the System Report button. In the Audio section you should see the output device you're connecting to. If it says \"Transport: DisplayPort\" there's the cause. DisplayPort supports a max of 8 channels.\n\nDisplayPort can be used to transmit audio and video simultaneously,\nalthough each is optional and can be transmitted without the other.\nThe video signal path can range from six to sixteen bits per color\nchannel, and the audio path can have up to eight channels of 24-bit,\n192 kHz PCM audio that is uncompressed.\n\nI'm running into this 8 channel cap using USB-C > HDMI from a Macbook Pro running Big Sur to a receiver which is configured for 7.1.4. The receiver auto-detects the input signal and is showing 7.1 on its front display when connected to the Macbook Pro. The receiver only registers in the Audio Midi Setup utility as being 7.1. I'm still investigating but will report back if I find a way to get more than 8 channels to output. Hopefully, there's a way to use a different protocol to get around DisplayPort's 8 channel max.\n", "Q: Wake up a sleeping or powered off M1 Mac Mini with a Wake-On-LAN packet? I have an M1 Mac Mini running Monterey 12.1. I would like to be able to put it to sleep or shut it down when not in use to conserve energy. But, I also want to be able to remotely power it up so I can access it when I need to using VNC or SMB.\nI have typically done this by sending WOL (WakeOnLan) magic packets from my home router which is pfSense. This has always worked fine—until this Mini.\nI've checked the Energy Saver prefs, made sure womp=1 in pmset -g and even tried mucking around with nvram / darkwake settings. I'm sure the Ethernet MAC address is correct. Nothing has worked. WOL to an Intel NUC sitting on the same network works as expected.\nWhat happens when I send the WOL packet is one of:\n\n*\n\n*absolutely nothing: no lights, no activity, screen remains dark.\n\n*power LED comes on, Mac becomes \"pingable\", screen stays dark, but after 5-10 seconds, the Mac goes back to sleep. At no point during this sequence am I able to connect\nvia VNC.\n\nIs this a hardware bug with the M1's? Anyone know of a solution?\n\nA: Have you tried setting the darkwake flag to 0 in the Kernel Flag section of /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist\nhttps://support.imperosoftware.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002206353-wake-on-lan-for-macos\n", "Q: Outlook search not working My Outlook search stopped working. There are no results for any query. There are a few suggestions online. None of them seem to work.

It seems that updating to 16.57 worked for some people there, but it did not for me.\n\nA: A colleague of mine was affected by this issue after migrating to a new MacBook Pro (2021) running macOS 12.4 (using a Time Machine Backup of his previous MacBook Pro running Big Sur). The Outlook version was 16.61.\nMy first attempts at rebuilding the Spotlight index using Onyx did not bring back search in Outlook, but with the following sequence of Terminal commands (taken from page 17 of the Mac Rumors thread you found) I was able to fix the issue on his Mac. To be on the safe side, I waited 15s after running each of the mdutil commands.\nHere are the commands you need to copy & paste to Terminal:\n\n*\n\n*sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist  (there's a good chance that this step is not necessary, but I did it anyway, just in case)\n\n*sudo mdutil -Eai off\n\n*sudo mdutil -Eai on\n\n*mdutil -as\nAfter running these commands, the Mac took significantly longer to recreate the Spotlight index than it did after I used Onyx. At some point during this process, Outlook would start to slowly show more and more search results.\n", "Q: Can you access the mp3 files of songs you've purchased on the iTunes Store?

It recommends disabling cross-site tracking in order to access Teams in safari, but I don't want to disable that option for obvious reasons. Is it the same for everyone or is there a fix for this?\n\nA: Yes, this \"error\" has been appearing since I started using Teams on macOS/Safari which was probably some time between BigSur or Catalina.\nBrowsers are different and therefore complex websites (like Teams) need to be optimized for the browsers. The fact is that Chrome is by far the most used Browser, therefore websites are well optimized for Chrome while Safari is far less popular and therefore less important to developers.\nI would either just download the App or use another Browser like Chrome, Firefox...\n\nA: We are recommending the Edge browser for Mac users wanting to use teams / O365 web apps at work.

How do I terminate ALL the ESTABLISHED tcp connections in Terminal?\nI can use the command below to get a list of active & established connections:\nnetstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /ESTABLISHED/‘\nI would like to terminate the connections one by one OR all at the same time. How can I do this?\n\nA: The fact that a connection has been made means that connection is already genuine. I would probably look to block connections that reappear with an access control list or firewall software like Little Snitch.\n\n*\n\n*https://obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\nIt is superb at this task and will help you begin to wrangle all the genuine and intentional connections and let you put rules and values so you can manage the connections and control them at the source.

I'm trying to use Automator to create a \"Quick Action\" that will archive and encrypt a folder. I create a workflow that looks like this:\n[create archive]\n[ask for text]    - for password\n[shell script]    - will run openssl command to encrypt the zip archive\n\nThe shell script gets the output of the previous step as an argument. But I need the output of both the previous steps. Is there a way to do that? The create archive step gives me a path to the zip file, and the ask for text gives me the password text.\n\nA: In an Automator workflow, each action gets its input from the previous action, does its thing, and returns its results for the next action to use.  Any given action can add, change, or remove its input items, so if you want to keep something for a later action, you can use variables to store the desired items/results.\nThe following example uses Ask for Finder Items to get a path, but since Ask for Text uses its input for the dialog, a Set Value of Variable is used to save the path, where later it is added back into the workflow items.  A Run Shell Script action can then get all these items and arrange them based on their order:\n\n", "Q: Does apple store support need customers to disable mac password or disable find-my-mac? Recently I went into a physical/retail Apple Store, and - I told them that previously (more than a year ago) - one of their team members asked me to remove my password and disable find my mac before they took my computer around the back for diagnosis / repairs.\nShould I have removed the password and disable find my mac? Why would they need this information?\n\nA: Find My first: This is a precaution against the repair requiring, for example, mainboard replacement. Also Find My's purpose is to enable tracking in the event of theft, so should not be needed whilst in the Apple Store. I would not have any qualms about that.\nPassword: This would be so that they could log in to the computer to run diagnostics. Removing (or giving them) the password involves a matter of trust. Do you trust the Apple Store to do the right thing? And what is the value or privacy status of what was on the Mac?\nIf it were me, I would have removed it from iCloud and Find Me, erased the disk and installed vanilla macOS before taking it to the Apple store. It is straight forward to recover from your backup afterwards.\nRegarding backups, it is important to have a good backup before taking to the Apple Store as Apple may need to reformat the disk (depending on the fault) and Apple makes it clear that the data is your responsibility.\n", "Q: What does \"temp\", \"reject\", \"blackhole\" mean?

The Ethernet address is given as six hex bytes separated by colons.  The entry will be permanent unless the word temp is given in the command.  If the word pub is given, the entry will be \"published\"; i.e., this system will act as an ARP server, responding to requests for hostname even though the host address is not its own.  In this case the ether_addr can be given as auto in which case the interfaces on this host will be examined, and if one of them is found to occupy the same subnet, its Ethernet address will be used.  If the only keyword is also specified, this will create a \"published (proxy only)\" entry. This type of entry is created automatically if arp detects that a routing table entry for hostname already exists.\nIf the reject keyword is specified the entry will be marked so that traffic to the host will be discarded and the sender will be notified the host is unreachable.  The blackhole keyword is similar in that traffic is discarded but the sender is not notified. These can be used to block external traffic to a host without using a firewall.\n\n", "Q: macOS Monterey 12.1 - Disable MagicMouse horizontal scrolling How can I disable the horizontal scrolling feature of the MagicMouse?

That changed with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger in 2005 with the introduction of Apple System Log. Finally with macOS 10.12 Sierra in 2016 ASL was superseded by Unified Logging. I'm assuming the \"constantly changing syslog features\" you mention are those 2 changes over 22 years.\nYou can view authentication logs in a streaming fashion like this:\nlog stream -predicate 'category==\"auth\"'\n\nor specifically such as:\nlog stream -predicate 'process==\"opendirectoryd\"'\n\n(Note that your definition of authentication logs might differ, so be sure to change the filter to your liking)\nThe next part is sending that information to the SIEM. Most SIEM systems have log collectors for various systems. Maybe yours have one for ASL?\nIf your SIEM only supports syslog, you can use a tool such as remote_syslog2 to take the output from the log command above and forward it over the syslog protocol.\nYou can change the log command slightly to get a more \"syslog friendly\" look:\nlog stream --style syslog -predicate 'category==\"auth\"'\n\n", "Q: Tool to combine Pages documents?

Can I share an iPad folder with Windows, so Windows can access this folder?\n\n*\n\n*I do NOT mean to access a Windows shared folder from the iPad (e.g. as in How to access Windows share from an iPad?), BUT vice versa.\n\n*I do NOT want to use cloud services, but only my local network.\n\n*It should work directly via the network, not via an USB connect and not via iTunes. I would like to directly connect the folder via Windows.\n\n\nA: What you are proposing is somewhat unusual as an iPad (and its operating system) is not well designed to act as a server. Nevertheless it should be possible though with some restrictions (sandboxing).\nYou need an app which will act as a file server on the iPad.  A file server might use one of a number of protocols for sharing. Lets list a few and any apps I know of:\n\n*\n\n*SMB (Windows file sharing): I am not aware of any iOS app which acts as an SMB server.\n\n\n*WebDAV which uses http: Apps like GoodReader or Documents by Readdle include a webDAV server, there may well be others.\n\n\n*FTP: At one time there was an iOS app called 'FTP Server', but it is no longer in the App Store.  I don't know of any other.\nRemember that even if you use Readdle's Documents or some other server app, Apple's sandboxing requirements mean that any file transfers can only be to and from the application's Documents folder on the iPad.\nA further restriction, confirmed by @HorstWalter's testing, is that the webDAV servers above only remain active whilst the app is in the foreground.\n\nA: Use Documents from the App Store. It lets you setup a web server on your iPad and you can access files from Windows PC on your network.\n", "Q: Can't force quit application even in Activity Monitor (AnyTransToolHelpers) I installed AnyTrans.

I have had a Macbook Pro 2019 for two years and I almost always use it plugged to the AC. Let's say I let it fully run out of battery power roughly once a week, just as I used to do with my former MacBook Pro.\nI have noticed, though, that its battery lifespan has reduced at a much quicker rate than its predecessor's, which seems strange to me. Then I have realised that, contrary to my former MacBook, I very often use my iPhone as a USB hotspot, because my present house has neither an ethernet nor a Wi-Fi connection .\nTherefore, I am wondering if my iPhone is draining the battery of my MacBook when plugged into it also if the computer is running on AC. From the system information dialogue, it seems that this is not happening, but my observation on the battery quicker drainage after a comparable usage time stays...\nDoes anybody know the answer ? And, if this is actually the case, is there a way to tweak the settings so that the iPhone stops using the MacBook's battery power ?\nThanks everybody in advance !\n\nA: Battery lifespan and usage is a complex topic and may things factor into it.\n\nI am wondering if my iPhone is draining the battery of my MacBook when plugged into it also if the computer is running on AC\n\nThe most likely answer is no.\nHowever, depending on what wall adapter you are using and what you are doing with your MacBook it may need the battery. Say your wall adapter only provides 60Watts, your MacBook uses 80W and you also plug in your phone (usually USB gives 5W). Thats 25W more than what you are getting from the wall. It has to come from the battery. Yet, this should be indicated by the MacBook.\nSo, depending on the wall adapter the answer may actually be yes. In that case your battery will drain, although connected to an outlet.\nIf I understand you correctly though, the problem is actually a decreased battery capacity. It would be interesting to see exact numbers, e.g. from coconut battery. Battery lifespan mostly (but there are many other factors) depends on the temperature it has been used in. I.e. when you always push your MBP to its limits and temperatures rise for a long period the battery will be in a worse state if you used the same amount of cycles in cooler conditions.\nMany people claim its also better to not let the battery fully drain, however, the effect seems to be less devastating as some state. Yet, it seems measurable and therefore I try to not go down to 0% when possible,\nApples tips on how to maximize battery life: https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n", "Q: The \"New Note\" option is disabled in the Notes app in macOS 12.

After that, if you create a quick note via hot corner activation, it enables again.\nI faced this issue several times, almost after every restart of my Mac, and found this solution. I have had to create a quick note first even if I want to create a note in Notes app. I think, this is a bug and it's been ongoing since 12.0.0 MacOS and 15.0.0 iOS/iPadOS.\n\nA: Update: Creating a new Quick Note from the bottom right hot corner seems to be a suitable workaround for now.

New to MacBook Pro 2019 (with current OS)\nAs I am tweaking the hotkeys for my Windows brain, there have been several times I added a key to an entry in System Prefs->Keyboard->Shortcuts but no longer want it.\nSome of them have a checkbox to enable/disable;  many do not:\n\nHeck, the original value for the circled key assigned was none.  :roll-eyes:\nI am not willing to 'Restore Default'  -- I want the rest of my changes.\nAnd I do not want to put some garbage key assignment -- that doesn't mesh with my perfectionist personality.  :geek-smiley:\nI really wish you could right click any field and it would show you the default value and give option to Restore that (for this field only) or Delete it.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Hey brother I know the feeling but the best thing you can do is screenshot what you got already and then restore to defaults and do it again. It sucks brother; I know I've had to restore to default every time I made the smallest mistake. I would suggest putting in a ticket to Apple to add that feature. I personally use the MX 3 mouse and have like 15 shortcuts added to it.\n\nA: Workaround: assign very difficult and unusual shortcut to what you don't want to use, I usually do the fn key with combination of crazy ones \n\n", "Q: Unable to open Linux ISO file how can I open / modify a (linux) ISO?\nIf I try to open it via DiskUtility it says The disk you attached was not readable by this computer.\nThe image is the current release of ArchLinux: https://www.archlinux.de/download\n\nA: On my M1 Mac with macOS 12.3 (Monterey), double-clicking the ISO produces no result.

I need a straight forward answer in layman terms on resolution scaling. 1080p vs 1050p M1 13 inch MacBook. I know that our 13 inch Macs are 1600p but scaling closest to that is 1050p. 1080p Is clearly a higher number but we have a 1600p display selected at 1050p. So when playing games will 1050p look much better than 1080p? if so how and why. as a side note 800p is 1600p cut in half so I know thats the cleanest option so wouldn't that be even better then 1050p? ive searched for 100's of hours fellas I just want answers please.\n\nA: The 13\" M1 MacBook Pro/Air has an actual display of 2560 x 1600 pixels.\nThe scaled resolutions offered are 1680 by 1050 (x1.52), 1440 by 900 (x1.77), and 1024 by 640 (x2.5) pixels.\nThe scale factors in brackets show the number of real pixels that make a scaled cell. It is perhaps curious that there isn't a 1280 x 800 (x2) size.\nA size of 1728 x 1080 (x1.48) might also be possible, though there may be maths reasons why calculating these missing scalings is difficult.\nMy advice is simply to test each of the available sizes and see what quality and speed you get. There are programs that allow custom screen scalings: SwitchResX is the best known.\n", "Q: Using cables, how do I mirror my macbook's screen onto an iPhone screen? It's nice that I can mirror my iPhone onto my Macbook using a simple lighting to USB-whatever cable, then open Quicktime but what about the inverse of this? I want to simply record my mac's screen booting up into recovery, or record it in places where you usually wouldn't be able to open up Quicktime and record your entire screen.\nDo I need to use an HDMI cable from my mac going into an external monitor, then record the monitor or can I use a dongle and trick my mac into sending HDMI input to my phone? Simply put, it's like recording the screen of a virtual machine.\nI have a Macbook18,3 running macOS 12.1 and an iPhone 11 running iOS 15.1. If you happen to bring up third party apps, try and keep it free\n\nA: The iPhone in itself is not able to record HDMI. The linked dongle is for outputting HDMI from an iPhone - it will not be able to record HDMI for you.\nThe alternative you mentioned is the simplest way to do this - simply display the HDMI output on a monitor, and use the iPhone's camera to make a video of the monitor.\nIf you really want to record HDMI on the iPhone, you need a USB video capture device plugged into a the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter. However, you need to select a suitable video capture device, as not all video capture devices work on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Changing the title of an alert button maliciously Is it possible for a malicious developer to interchange ok and cancel in the title of an alert button?

A mistake or error in the code written by the developer can create this behaviour.\n", "Q: What is the auto-save path in BBEdit 14? For BBEdit 14, what is the path where unsaved files are auto-saved (for re-opening when BBEdit is restarted)?\nMany other[1] internet[2] sources[3] point to the path being ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Auto-Save Recovery, however on multiple machines I use, my unsaved files still re-open despite the fact that the \"Auto-Save Recovery\" folder does not exist. I have even tried recursive-grep'ing my home directory for a unique string in one of my unsaved files, but I cannot find any match (grep never seems to complete, but that is a different issue).\n\nA: BBEdit is fully sandboxed, so it's component folders are all inside the Containers subfolder of the Library.\n~/Library/Containers/com.barebones.bbedit/Data/Library/BBEdit/Auto-Save Recovery\n\nseems to 'contain' ;-) the auto-saves.\n~/Library/Containers/com.barebones.bbedit/Data/Library/Application Support/BBEdit\n\nalso has most of the other stuff.\n\nA: Just in case someone comes on this page after accidentally overwriting a remote file editing with BBEdit (such as I just did), you can recover almost any file from Documents > BBEdit Backups\nI don't know if I'm just lucky or if it's the standard configuration, but in BBEdit Preferences > Text files, I have «Make backup before saving» and «Keep historical backups» options checked, which surely help in such a case.\n\nA: Is this question about where unsaved files located or about how to avoid re-opening unsaved files? For the first benwiggy has the answer.  For the latter - from BBEdit 14 User Manual:\n\nRestore unsaved changes. When this option is on, BBEdit will preserve the contents of any unsaved document contents when you quit (including untitled documents) and restore those documents the next time you launch it. If you prefer the traditional Quit behaviour, turn this option off\n\nManual states about deleting files in Auto-Save Recovery:\n\nAuto-Save Recovery. BBEdit will automatically create this folder. The Auto-Save Recovery folder contains information which BBEdit can use to recover the contents of unsaved documents after a crash, or to restore them at launch. Removing items from this folder can cause data loss\n\n", "Q: How can I fix my Documents folder after installing and uninstalling Dropbox app?

How can this be fixed, so it is a normal folder again?\n\nA: A complete restart fixed it, so it indicates that Dropbox had placed some sort of alias / redirection or mounted a new file system over the files which were safe.\n", "Q: very old iPad 2's Youtube app won't update anymore I just get stuck on \"Tap to Retry\" get a pop up box to update but it does not (forget exact sequence of the \"stuck\" loop.\nWhat is like a nuclear option way to update Youtube app on old iPad 2?\nI cannot play any videos on it now and it only shows Tap to Retry.\n\nA: The iPad 2 can be updated up to iOS 9.3.6 only, the current version of the YouTube app requires iOS/iPadOS 12 though. So you can‘t update the app on that iPad any longer.\nYou can try to use Safari to access YouTube instead.\n", "Q: Why is there no option to print from Safari on iOS? For quite some time (although I don't know when this began), I've been dumbfounded by the fact that I can't find any option for printing from Sfaari.

If I click on \"Edit Actions…\", it's nowhere to be found.\nThere is a Print option in other apps, such as Mail.\nI do have an available AirPrint printer on my network, but I think there would still be a Print option even if I didn't have one.\nHow can I troubleshoot iOS share when it’s missing print from mobile Safari on iOS 15?\n\nA: Settings > Safari > \"Clear History and Website Data\" seems to have fixed the problem!\n", "Q: iPad won't launch any app, won't update, won't reset My iPad Pro (2018, iPadOS 15.1) will not launch any app anymore.\n\n*\n\n*The home screen / springboard is responsive, I can reorganize apps and browse the App Library. The home screen only has app icons (1 page then the App Library), I removed all widgets earlier just in case.\n\n*Launching any app will try to launch it but freeze and quit it. Safari opens a black page with the address bar then quits after 30 seconds. Apple apps and third-party apps all behave the same except the Camera app for some reason.

It's like the iPad is soft-bricked, I've never seen this in 10+ years of using iPads.\n\nA: While I did not figure out how to get the apps to launch, I did find a way to reset the iPad and restore it from a backup:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPad to an up-to-date Mac\n\n*Enter recovery mode by long-pressing the Home and Power buttons until the  Recovery Mode screen appears (more info: https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-recovery-mode-stuck-at-apple-logo-1994540). Without entering Recovery Mode, my Mac was unable to update or reset the iPad. I imagine DFU Mode would have also worked in this situation.\n\n*In Finder, click \"Restore…\" to reset the iPad to factory settings, which in my case also installed iPadOS 15.2.1, after which I was able to choose \"Restore from an iCloud backup\" to get all apps and settings back.\n\nThe backup has been working well so far, with none of the symptoms from the initial questions. All apps are running fine and smoothly like they did a few days ago.\n", "Q: How can I kill a process from Terminal using the visible window name? This question is similar in spirit to How can I kill a process by its name?, but not a duplicate for the reason below.\nAs an example, here's how IntelliJ appears in Activity Monitor:\n\nThe name is \"IntelliJ IDEA\". This is also the name visible when you toggle windows. However ps aux will show the process name as idea because that's the name of the process being executed:\n\n/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS/idea\n\nTyping pkill -i intellij does nothing, as you have to type pkill -i idea to actually kill the right process. But is there a way to do this without having to lookup the right process name first? I'd like to type in kill_by_visible_name intellij and see the process terminated.\nOne option is to run ps aux | grep -i intellij but this will also find processes that happen to run from a folder named \"IntelliJ\", not just the actual IntelliJ process. This will also fail for processes where the visible name is not the same as the name of the application folder. Another option is to lookup the PID within Activity Monitor, but this is time consuming when you already know the name of the application.\n\nA: Figured out this is possible using lsappinfo:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]\nthen\n      echo \"Please provide a process name\"\n      exit\nfi\napps_list=$(lsappinfo)\nfound_line_numbers=$(echo \"$apps_list\"  | grep -nE '([0-9]+\\) \"[a-zA-Z ]+\")' | grep -i \"$1\" | awk '{print $1}' FS=\":\")\nif [ -z \"$found_line_numbers\" ]\nthen\n      echo \"Process named $1 not found\"\nelse\n      while IFS= read -r line; do\n        line_pid=$(echo \"$apps_list\" | tail -n +$line | head -n 5 | grep pid | awk -F ' ' '{print $3}')\n        echo \"Trying to kill process $line_pid\"\n        kill -9 \"$line_pid\"\n      done <<< \"$found_line_numbers\"\nfi\n\nThe grep/awk combo is a bit awkward, but I couldn't find a better to extract the PID from lsappinfo.\n", "Q: M1 MacBook runs out of battery while sleeping My MacBook(MacBook Pro M1 Max 16-inch, 2021, Monterey v12.0.1) runs out of battery while sleeping.

I'd like to set the poster frame for some of my videos to make it easier to see what they are at a glance. As this answer describes, this used to be possible using the gear menu and then later using a pop-up on the timeline in edit mode.\nIn MacOS Monterey, neither of these options seem to work. The timeline editor still behaves the same way, but the popup to set the poster frame doesn't exist:\n\nSometimes if I drag the start time around and then exit the editor the poster frame changes, but it doesn't seem to happen reliably or predictably.\nHow can I set the poster frame for a video with Photos.app in MacOS Monterey?\n\nA: In \"Edit\" mode, select the frame in the video you want as poster frame, then click the menu item \"Image\" and select \"Make Poster Frame\".  Click \"Done\".\nThese instructions can also be found at Apple's support pages:\nApple Support\n\nSelect a video frame as a Poster Frame: Drag the playhead to the frame\nyou want, then choose Image > Make Poster Frame.\n\nAdditionally I just want to point out that the \"Help\" menu has become very helpful, especially for finding menu items.

But I don't want them to be able to buy an app or make in-app purchases.\n\nA: You may use the Ask to Buy feature provided in Family Sharing.

(Refer: https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm)\nIt has worked flawlessly, until the macOS upgrade to Monterey 12.1.\nThe new behaviour was noticed on both my MacBook Pro (early 2015) and Mac mini (2018).\nWith Firefox, ads continue to be blocked just as before.\nI can now only block ads in Safari (15.2) by using a content blocker e.g. Adblock Plus.\nIt seems as though Safari on Monterey is ignoring the HOSTS file. I have tried restarts of Safari and the Mac and flushing the DNS cache, all to no avail.\nAs a test I added www.nytimes.com to the hosts file. On Firefox, the site doesn't appear to exist. Safari opens it as per usual - so it is definitely ignoring HOSTS.\nAnyone else noticed this issue?\nUpdate: the issue only occurs when Hide IP address for Trackers and Websites is selected; it does not occur when Hide IP address for Trackers only is selected.\nMy understanding is that browsers should never ignore HOSTS as they may be required for Intranet and other redirects/blocks.\n\nA: \nUpdate: the issue only occurs when Hide IP address for Trackers and Websites is selected; it does not occur when Hide IP address for Trackers only is selected.\n\nAs you've observed, \"Hide IP address\" (which is also known as iCloud Private Relay) is uses a completely separate process for resolving DNS queries.\nFrom the whitepaper:\n\nTo protect the privacy of DNS name resolution for all queries sent by the device and prevent such tracking, Private Relay uses Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH).\n\n\nODoH sends DNS queries through the first internet relay, so the DNS server\ncannot identify the user issuing a query. Each query itself is padded and\nencrypted using Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) to help ensure that the\nfirst internet relay cannot tell the domain name a user is looking up\n\nEvidently, this process doesn't read the HOSTS file.\n\n\nMy understanding is that browsers should never ignore HOSTS as they may be required for Intranet and other redirects/blocks.\n\nThis is also addressed:\n\nIf a proxy or ODoH server detects that a specific server name is not a public internet name, it instructs the device to try to access the server directly over the local network. For added protection, the device will never allow direct connections to names that are on the DuckDuckGo known tracker list.\n\nWhile it appears that you could add a custom domain in your HOSTS file, you cannot modify any domain that resolves on iCloud Private Relay.\nOne last thing:\n\nIf a user has configured custom-encrypted DNS settings using a profile or an app, the DNS server specified will be used instead of ODoH. Safari connections and all unencrypted HTTP connections will also resolve names using the specified DNS server prior to routing through Private Relay.\n\n\nAn unencrypted DNS server provided by a local network or manually edited in Settings (iOS) or System Preferences (macOS) will not be used for iCloud Private Relay traffic.\n\nIf you want to provide your own DNS service, you can. This means that a custom DNS service that doesn't resolve those hostnames should work fine.\n\nA: Safari and other browsers often pass your URL to the search engine database which can’t know what you’re trying to block locally.\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/431981/5472\n", "Q: How can I completely disable my AppleID from receiving iMessages? I have a MacBook Pro and an Android phone. I signed into iCloud and Messages on mac with my AppleID. I then sent a message to my colleague, using Messages app, he responded.\nI then unchecked 'Enable iMessages in iCloud' and signed out of my Messages app. I'm not logged in anywhere but my friend can still send iMessages to my AppleID, even though I am not signed it anywhere else and iCloud for iMessages is not enabled. The messages of course are not delivered, but why is he able to send them at all and how to disable it completely?\nIs the fact that my appleID is used for iMessages cached on his phone? on the server? How long will it wait before realizing iMessage is not an option?\nI do not want to use iMessage on Mac at all, where will his messages end up? And how soon will he know the delivery failed?\nI'm surprised to learn it's not immediate after signing out of the account.\n\nA: This is not something I've ever tested, but you probably ought to have unchecked the others too…\nEnable this account & You can be reached for messages as\n\nYou can disable a phone number previously registered even if you don't have a Mac or iPhone -  Apple - Deregister iMessage\n", "Q: Default PHP included with Mac - enable imagecreatefromjpg I've uncommented gd in php.ini - but I still can't get imagecreatefromjpg() to work... How does one enable php with jpg support? (the default php that comes with mac - not xampp or homebrew. trying to avoid multiple installations, low disk space etc)\n\nFatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function imagecreatefromjpg()\n\n\nA: I see you have asked not to use homebrew, but if you are doing web development on your Mac then you should really be using it. At a guess, the pre-installed PHP on Mac OS probably does not have the GD library installed.\nIf you install brew.sh you can then run brew install gd which will add the GD library which contains imagecreatefromjpg() and other image manipulation functions.\n", "Q: I cannot back-button to get to google search results In Safari on macOS:\n\n*\n\n*Open a new tab\n\n*Search for something using Safari omnibar (type something into the omnibar, press enter, be presented with Google search results webpage)\n\n*Click a result\n\n*Press back (or cmd [)\n\nIt takes you back to new tab start page, not to search results.\nHow can I make it take me to search results instead? The search results page does not show up in history either.\n\nA: Even though the question is a few months old now, I recently had the same problem with Safari 15.5 and macOS 12.4. In addition, some websites did not load properly.\nFor me, it helped to close all open tabs and restart Safari.\n\nA: I was experiencing this same issue. I was able to fix it by disabling all of the checkbox options in Safari search settings and clicking ok. Google searches then showed up in history. Re-enabling all these checkboxes still allowed the searches to show up in history.\n\n*\n\n*Safari version 16.1\n\n*OSX Ventura 13.0.1\n\n\n\nA: I don’t understand the comment by @Tetsujin that \"you never opened a search page\" when that is literally what Safari is doing when using the address bar to search Google. You search in Safari, Safari opens a Google search results page, therefore this page should be in your Safari history and Safari should go back to this page when hitting the back button after clicking on one of the results. This is a bug, plain and simple, and is not Safari's expected behavior.\nMy understanding is that Safari does not generate a full Google search results page \"on the fly\" or do any search at all other than open a search page. This to me is obviously a very annoying bug.\n\nA: I was not able to find a way to reproduce your issue, but rather than continue in comments on another answer, I'll stake a proper answer so we can edit it into shape.\n\n*\n\n*Google puts one entry into my history for each \"search\" and then press enter (two searches produce two history entries)\n\n*Duck Duck Go puts two entries (two searches produce four history entries)\n\nYou may be on to something where the \"second\" entry is being suppressed on your specific profile or there's a setting to suppress it. If my theory is valid - you might only get one entry for Duck Duck Go and zero for google.\nTo reproduce my results - clear all search history and then toggle off all the items except Include search engine suggestions (although I don't see any of these settings below changing my results)\n\nHere is what google search for two phrases shows in my history - first using Google - then using Duck Duck Go\n\nI wonder if people that lack these history events have extensions or settings that may be affecting this. A quick way to isolate that would be to make a new user on your Mac and repeat the quick test above.\n", "Q: Iphone 7 Plus doesn't start up and stuck in loop while charging I have an iPhone 7 plus which has this weird problem.\nIt doesn't start up with the side button.

If you mess up (even by accident), you may end up with no useable backup at all.\nWhat might be easier to do is to take full-image snapshots with tools like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner at specific points in time (e.g. before major upgrades) and store these snapshots on separate drives.\n", "Q: Pages change the words after exporting as PDF As we know, most companies have their NLP applications to analyze the resumes they receive.\nI recently noticed that if you export your PDF using Pages, the actual content will be changed after exporting to PDF.\nFor example, I have \"Computer Software Engineering\" on my Pages; you can see in the PDF file it is the same. Still, if you want to copy this sentence, it will be \"Computer SoCware Engineering.\" after you paste the content in a text editor.\nSo it will confuse pdf processor NLP application when you want to find a job.\nHow should I stop pages from making changes like this to my pdf files? please don't tell to use Microsoft word\n\nA: My first thought is that this is a font encoding error, caused by the inference of an 'ft' ligature character. However, that's an uncommon ligature in most fonts, which usually only have fi, fl, and ff.\nNormally, a PDF from Pages or other app should retain the underlying pair of characters that the ligature represents.\nSo, I would first check that you have really typed 'ft' in software; then perhaps try a different font.\n", "Q: iPhone SE 2 changing between portrait and regular mode, what exactly is happening and how can I reduce my visual confusion/distraction? I just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to an SE-2 and when I unlock my phone with the camera app running and bring it up to take a photo it usually switches between portrait and regular mode mid-swing.\nI don't have any problems actually taking the photo, but that visual discontinuity as the image on the screen changes during the mode change still momentarily confuses/distracts me.1\nIs there any way I can set the phone so that when I unlock it (with the camera app running) it comes up in regular mode and doesn't need to switch modes every time?\n\n1It's great if it doesn't confuse/distract you, perhaps I'm your neurological inferior.

I am contemplating whether to purchase a Personal Apple CodeSign certificate, for 99$/year. I have a medium-sized user base, and an app that is installed multiple times a month by each user. Upon installation, the user is required to allow 6 permissions in their Security Settings, for the app to function properly.\nIf I am to code-sign my app with an Apple certificate, would this eliminate the need for my users to perform this lengthy step each time they install the app? If not, what other approach can I take to eliminate this installation step?\n\nA: The permissions granted in the \"Security & Privacy\" preference pane are not related to code signing per se. These are runtime permissions that user can grant or revoke, and the app would still continue to be able to run (your app should react to the corresponding errors of the APIs related to these permissions, of course).\nUsually, you only have to give these permissions once. An update should not reset them (that is: the bundle identifier must stay the same). At least that's the way it works with App Store, Ad Hoc, and Developer ID signed apps. I'm not entirely sure whether it's true for completely unsigned apps, though.\nSo as long as the bundler identifier stays the same and the app is updated by replacing it in its previous location, the permissions should not need to be granted anew.\n", "Q: Use magsafe and USB-C display with charging capabilities I've a m1 macbook pro 14\" and a LG 27UK670-B display connected via USB-C to the mac. Connecting via USB-C leads to the macbook charging it's battery (taking power from the display). I'd however prefer using the original magsafe charger while keeping the USB-C for simplicity. Can this be accomplish or should I drop the USB-C connection and simply go for the HDMI option? TYVM.\n\nA: While I have not seen this documented anywhere to confirm this behavior I believe it safe to assume that the new laptops with MagSafe operate much like previous laptops with only USB-C for power, the laptop will draw power from the more powerful power supply.  Connecting two power supplies will do no harm, the laptop will simply draw power from whichever source reports itself as supporting the greater capability.\nIs there some concern that the connection of two power sources would do harm?  I'd think that Apple engineers would know it is certain people would connect more than one possible source of power and put in protections to prevent harm.  There's no reason you should have a concern on connecting both the USB-C display and the MagSafe power supply.\nYou mention a preference for USB-C for \"simplicity\", I don't understand how USB-C is any simpler than HDMI.  Is it because you move your laptop often and prefer the \"flippable\" USB-C?  Are you using the display as a kind of dock to connect other devices?  Whatever the case feel free to use either port to connect your display as this should have no impact on your ability to use MagSafe for power.\n", "Q: External hard drive fail to mount with APFS error \"com.apple.DiskManagement.disenter error 49218\" I can't open my WD external drive after I reboot my mac with Monterey 12.1!\nI know that so many people had a similar problem so I followed all those solutions, but they are not working for me.

(As a last resort.)\n\nA: I'm afraid you will need to erase all the data contained in the hdd. Click Erase and you can either click MS-DOS(FAT), APFS or any other format in the Format section and select the scheme right below it. You can click either GUID Partition Map or Master Boot Record. Then Click Erase.\n(PS: it works for me when I had it wouldn't mount automatically with a name disk2s2 in it.)\n", "Q: Troubleshooting problem with My Photo Stream not syncing The \"My photo stream\" feature doesn't seem to be working for me as of recently.\nI would like to be able to take pictures with my iPhone (iPhone SE, software version 15.1) and see and use the pictures in in the Photos application in my mac (OS Monterrey). I don't want to use any iCloud features to transfer/store my pictures.\nThings I tried/verified:\n\n*\n\n*I made sure both devices use the same Apple ID\n\n*I made sure that in my phone I have \"my photo stream\" enabled and the phone is connected to wifi (I read it won't upload pictures to the stream using cellular data)\n\n*I made sure that in my laptop Photos > Preferences also has \"my photo stream enable\".\n\n(In my mac's System Preferences > Apple ID I see the same as in my phone, and I see \"my photo stream\" enabled everywhere)\nBackground (or other potentially related stuff)\nRecently (maybe a month ago or so) I updated the OS (to Monterrey) in my mac. As I did it I was forced to change my apple ID password (apparently my Apple ID password and my iCloud password no longer could be the same). After that I had a problem when logging in in my mac and I was asked for both passwords when logging.\nI researched this issue and fixed it (by dealing with keychains and forcing the computer to re-encrypt data, to remove some stored info about my Apple ID/old password user). Nothing fancy, but that can be related to the issue.\nI'm mentioning this because it's the only recent change to the computer and I think I don't have any picture in Photos app from after this OS upgrade.\nI took an old phone (where I have the My Stream Photos enabled too) and took a picture with it. I can see that picture in my new phone and the old phone downloaded pictures that were in the stream, taken with the new phone. It's clear from this that it's the Photos application in my mac the one that is not connecting well to the stream, but I don't understand why.\nAfter searching on the Internet and this stack and seeing the regular advice about having the options enabled, making sure you have the right IDs in all devices, etc. I don't know what else to do to troubleshoot and fix this problem.\nWhy is Photos in my laptop not syncing with my stream like my other devices?\nOther things I tried\n\n*\n\n*Holding CMD + alt and starting Photos to repair\n\n*Deleting CloudSync.noindex\n\n*I could not check the iCloud option for photos, because it would force me to buy additional storage for iCloud. I was hoping to force a re-sync with this, but I can't select the iCloud option.\n\n*I disabled the \"live\" feature for my pictures, since I read that \"You won’t be able to see Photo Stream Photos from iPhone or iPad on your Mac\", but it didn't work for me.\n\n\nA: having same issue. Had non sync happing over the years and normally it helped to upgrade the software of the iOS or sometimes MacOS upgrade. Now have latest Monterey (12.3) in Mac Mini M1 and latest iOS (15.4) in iPhone 12. Photo stream does not sync between these devices. Interestingly I have old iPhone 7 running iOS 15.3.1 that does sync fine with Photo stream to M1 and iPhone 7 photos sync to iPhone 12 as well. Just iPhone 12->Mac M1 is broken.\nPhoto stream broke before latest iOS update though, I upgraded to try to resolve the situation, this time upgrade did not help.\nWould be great if Apple would show status of Photo stream somewhere, guessing with random settings is so annoying.\nUPDATE:\nI got my Photo stream to work. Noticed that iPhone12 now uses HEIC codec rather than JPG after software update. Changing HEIC->JPG (Camera->formats->Most compatible) made Photo stream to work. I think reason is old iPad Air1, that is not HEIC compatible with iOS12 and as part of the same Photo stream as iPhone12/7/iPad Air/Mac M1 it blocks HEIC photos from the Photo stream.\n", "Q: Save all macports packages of Big Sur and install them or upgrade them into new macport packages manager of Monterey OS I have just upgraded my macBook pro 16\" from Big Sur to Monterey.\nThe issue is that I have tried to save all the macports that I had previously on Big Sur but I get an error :\n$ sudo port -qv installed > myports.txt\nError: Current platform \"darwin 21\" does not match expected platform \"darwin 20\"\nError: If you upgraded your OS, please follow the migration instructions: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration\nError: /opt/local/bin/port: Failed to initialize MacPorts, OS platform mismatch\n\nport selfupdate\nError: Current platform \"darwin 21\" does not match expected platform \"darwin 20\"\nError: If you upgraded your OS, please follow the migration instructions: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration\nOS platform mismatch\n    while executing\n\"mportinit ui_options global_options global_variations\"\nError: /opt/local/bin/port: Failed to initialize MacPorts, OS platform mismatch\n\nI would like to install the new version of macport for Monterey but I don't know how to save all the /opt/local/* packages of previous macOS Big Sur macports.\nCould anyone see a fix to keep all my macports packages with Monterey OS ?\n\nA: The official Macports migration instructions are here https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration\nThey suggest installing the new Macports version before running the port -qv installed  command - thus you should not get that error.\nPersonally I run the port -qv installed  command whilst still on the old macOPS and then do the OS and macports reinstallation\n", "Q: Force charging MacBook from a specific USB-C port? here is my situation:\n\n*\n\n*my screen is plugged into a USB-C port, and can charge my 15-inch 2017 MacBook Pro, but can't actually supply enough power during periods of intense usage.\n\n*my USB-C power adaptor can supply enough power, so I'd like to use that instead.\n\nHowever: plugging in the screen, then plugging in the power adaptor has no effect on power delivery (checked using a USB-C PD debugger dongle: it's at 5V and supplies 0A.)\nUnplugging the screen, plugging in the power adaptor, then plugging the screen back in does work (I get 19-20V 2.9A from the adaptor). But it's annoying, and easy to forget (especially since I don't keep the PD debugger dongle in the loop the entire time, and it's hard to tell when it's in the correct state).\nSo: Is there a way I can force getting USB-C power from another port without physically unplugging things?

I'm not positive that you'll see any messages that give you more information about which app it is, but fingers crossed you may see something like \"Finished scanning domain\" and then the AppDomain for the app after the error messages for the stat error.\nOr, if you have an older backup of the iPhone from before the errors started, you can see if that string is in the Manifest.plist and see which app it is the Path for.\n", "Q: Can an Apple expert reset or delete my firmware password on 2017 iMac running Monterey remotely or must I go to Genius Bar at store?

How can I delete Mail.app and associated data (like cached emails and mailboxes) from my laptop?\nThen, how can I reinstall a fresh version of Mail.app?\n\nA: To remove, and then redownload, a macOS default app is impossible.\nRemoving default apps, such as Podcasts.app, Mail.app, etc, can be made possible by 3rd-party or open-source applications such as this, but doing so can void the warranty of your copy of macOS (stopping you from getting more updates, etc). It is also possible to accidentally delete vital system files this way, and I personally do not recommend it.\nOnce you have deleted a preloaded application in this way, you cannot reinstall the official Apple version (which will get updates, etc) because it's not meant to be uninstalled, much less reinstalled. There is no public download.\nThere is a workaround:\nThis is a little more drastic, however, but you can uninstall and reinstall a fresh copy of macOS. Move files to an external device, reset the laptop, and reinstall macOS, then move your files back. This is a bit of a nuisance and can be finicky, however, so if there is any way to avoid this method, then it is advisable to do so.

The amount of numbers logged can varied from cell to cell. Basically, I just want to have the mean value of each cell.\n\nA: There are several ways to handle this, all with complications and side-effects.  This is because spreadsheets, in general, expect one datum per cell, and in this case, you've got at least 4.\nLet's assume the contents of cell A1 is \"15;20;25;25\"\nOne way is to split up the contents of that one cell into an appropriately sized range.  Instead of one cell, you might have A2 = \"15\", A3 = \"20\", A4 = \"25\", etc..\nNumbers doesn't have a single command for parsing strings like A1 into multiple cells, except when you open a non-native format file, like a .txt, .csv, or .xls file.  You may have better luck adjusting how data like that is input into your spreadsheet.\nAnother way is to use Number's Regex command.

As it does not display the __PAGEZERO region - it is because it is not in the list.\nYou can confirm that this is not a bug in vmmap, or a change in how it outputs allocations, by listing the regions with a different tool. For example use Instruments.app from Xcode, add the VM Tracker from the Library and you'll see that it displays the same list of regions.\nThe purpose of the __PAGEZERO region was for processes to list a portion of memory at the beginning of the address space as \"out of limits\". I.e. these are memory addresses that cannot be read and cannot be written to during the execution of the process. Traditionally, you wanted to guard a bit of memory space around the NULL pointer (address 0), so that bugs that triggered reads or writes of the NULL pointer would terminate the program instead of modifying important state.\nLater on with the introduction of the 64-bit address space, it was common to have a very large __PAGEZERO region - effectively blocking out all access to address 0x0 to 0x100000000. The reason for that is that it blocks access to all addresses that a 32-bit pointer can express. Often programs would have been originally written for a 32-bit environment and then later ported to a 64-bit environment. If the programmer wasn't careful, it is possible to do data conversions on pointers that effectively restrict them to 32-bits.\nOn a 32-bit system that is \"safe\" in that it doesn't actually harm anything in practice. However when the same code is run on a 64-bit system, this means that the program would try to access a completely different part of memory than intended. Therefore __PAGEZERO was extended to block all of the 32-bit pointers to prevent bugs like these from corrupting memory and instead make them very visible as program crashes.\nNote that some programs didn't have the large __PAGEZERO region as for example 32-bit programs wouldn't work with such as a region (obviously). Similarly for some 64-bit programs, it would be a choice to leave it out in certain special situations - for example a program such as WINE that could essentially run 32-bit applications within a 64-bit environment.\nToday, on recent macOS systems, 32-bit programs are no longer supported. The kernel is therefore free to enforce a so called \"hard pagezero\", meaning that this large address space is always blocked for all running programs. No matter if the program actually specifies such a region or not, all programs get the protection that comes with it. This is doable since 32-bits program are no longer supported and are no longer allowed to be executed.\nAs the hard pagezero is now directly enforced by the kernel for ordinary user-space processes, it is no longer necessary to explicitly include it in memory region lists. This is why it is no longer printed out by a tool such as vmmap.\n", "Q: No App Store updates after changes in terms and conditions In the last week the MacOS App Store has refused to update some free apps (Microsoft Remote Desktop, TickTick).

They can access through their hotspot but not Wifi At my company we have a Mac Mini set up in the office that we use to test out web tools. Everyone in the company has access to our VPN (L2TP over IPSec) and they access the Mac Mini while being connected to the VPN. We serve tools on the Mac Mini with various web clients.\nHOWEVER, with at least a couple people, they connect to the VPN and they cannot access the web clients on the Mac Mini. I have confirmed that their settings are correct, they have \"send all traffic over VPN\" checked, and they can access the internet as well as other clients we have made IP-restricted (but are not on the office network like the Mac Mini). They tried pinging the IP and got a timeout.\nOne of the people who can't access the Mac Mini tried it out with their mobile hotspot and it DID work and they were able to access the client.\nDoes anyone have any idea of what to try out here? I hope that because they use AT&T as their IP that it's not just hopeless. I'm mostly looking for ways to diagnose this problem.\nIf it's helpful, when accessing the test Mac Mini clients, we simply use http://192.168.x.x/<toolname>.\nAlso, at least one of these users has an AT&T router setup, and this has caused issues with our L2TP over IPSec VPN in the past.\n\nA: This problem may be caused by both local networks using the same network mask.\nFor example, if the office network uses 192.168.178.0/24, and the home network uses the same (or one that overlaps with it), then the VPN client cannot setup a dedicated routing, because the IP addresses are not unique. That's why it works when using the hotspot, because then the client will be in a different local network.\nTo fix this, change the network mask in the office to use another network mask. Select one that is not frequently used by home routers.\nPrivate IP address ranges:\n\n*\n\n*Class A: 10.0. 0.0 to 10.255. 255.255.\n\n*Class B: 172.16. 0.0 to\n172.31. 255.255.\n\n*Class C: 192.168. 0.0 to 192.168. 255.255.\n\n", "Q: Proxy configured through .pac file behind enterprise VPN doesn't apply to CURL (terminal) commands I can make a request to https://www.google.com in the browser behind VPN but when I curl that, it doesn't work.\nBut if I disable VPN and do a curl https://www.google.com it will send a response.\nWith VPN, the same curl request just hangs.\nTo me, it seems like the proxy setting set up in the adapter by the PAC file (under Automatic Proxy Configuration) isn't applied to the terminal/curl.\nAnyone experience this issue?\n\nA: Proxies are not automatically used system-wide.

How do view my own photos taken with my iPhone X (Camera set to take photos in HDR) on my MacBook Pro with the same level of contrast?\n\nA: This is a massively complex subject, so I'm going to avoid as much 'jargon & maths' as I can; but there will have to be some, even if simplified;)\nYou're confusing two different definitions of HDR [this is going to become a common theme in future, as Microsoft Windows has seen fit to adopt an old, familiar abbreviation & used it for a new, different, purpose.]\n\"Traditional\" HDR, as used in cameras for years, takes multiple exposures then combines them to bring details out of the darker areas, without washing out the light areas.\nThis is actually a form of dynamic compression. It actually reduces [or redistributes] the dynamic range so it can be displayed on a screen with a smaller gamut.\n\"Modern\" HDR, as adopted by Microsoft but not Apple, is a way of expanding the dynamic range by using 10 bits of data in the screen display, rather than the tradition 8 bits in use on most screens. This is actually based on a video spec HDR-10 [or BT2020], not a photographic spec.\nHDR10 is actually a bit of a poor spec & not really very future-proof, as it uses static not dynamic metadata [just go with me on this]. There's another, more inferior spec called PQ10, but we can ignore that one.]  A better, dynamic spec is Dolby Vision - this is what Apple TV uses, on capable TVs, Macs & iPhones.\nThere is a similar HDR spec used in both video & stills, called DCI-P3 [or often just P3 for short].\nEach of these is reliant on another standard - a colour profile, which is embedded in the image or video, to tell the viewing app how to display this colour range.\nThe old standard for images was sRGB for stills, and most screens & computers are set up to at least attempt to reproduce this colour gamut fully. The old standard for video was Rec 709. sRGB & Rec 709 have the same colour gamut [they can display the same range of colours] but have different gamma curves [they are different in how darks & lights are displayed]\nTVs were set up for Rec 709 & computers for sRGB. This is why movies played back on your older computers & TVs look different.\nThere are other higher range specs for professional use, but I'll skip these as I think we're getting enough 'info-dump' already ;)\nThis is all gradually being replaced by HDR10, P3 & variants.\nThis is where we start to become thankful for the P3 spec… it can be used for both video and stills without the need to recalibrate in between.\nI have yet to see an HDR10-capable display that doesn't just make a whole heap of mess out of any image displayed on it. As it stands, in my personal opinion, it is an option to switch off if at all possible. There seems to be no real calibration effort between 'broadcaster' & consumer. In short, you have no clue if what you are seeing is what was intended.\nP3 displays, however, seem to do a better job, even if not fully hardware-calibrated, just 'straight out of the box'.\nSo, here's the good news… in brief…\nYour iPhone takes images & video in P3.\nYour Mac's display is a P3-capable display.\nIt's already \"HDR\".\nNo user intervention required.\nSome background reading -\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10\nhttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/color-gamuts-a-quick-primer [this is aimed at photography, not video]\nhttps://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/docs/HDR_WideColor.pdf [this is how Apple handles 10-bit colour in Final Cut Pro so it's really for broadcasters not consumers. It doesn't do too much math]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3 [this is a bit sparse & a lot of numbers, not sure how much use it is tbh]\n\nA: The only way that I've found to view HDR photos on a XDR display in full quality is to load them into the Photos app. No other application that I know of will show these photos in HDR, but instead just the normal \"flattened\" versions.

It does not strip color from the clipboard, so you are likely not copying text that has color attributes.\nTo test this you can open three documents and make one plain, two rich. In the second one make text colored and copy / paste it into the other two documents.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/open-documents-txte51413d09/mac\nOnce you’re sure you have things sorted, repeat the copy and paste into one of the rich windows.

I use a Dell Ultrasharp webcam, which supports up to 4k resolution. On a Windows device, I am getting that full resolution and a pretty good overall image, provided my lightning is good.\nConnecting this webcam to my 2019 MBP running Monterey 12.1, it does work, it does give me a video, and can be used in applications like Photo Booth or MS Teams. Since Dell provides no application for the webcam for MacOS, I use the Webcam Settings app to optimize some aspects like Zoom level, Focus and so on.\nMy problem is that the video stream obviously does not make use of the full capability of the webcam. I can't say for certain what resolution it emits, but when checking the video in Photo Booth as a no-frills least common denominator, it looks more like 720p. The video metrics in MS Teams show a relatively small resolution as well (though I do not know if that is because of the webcam or server-side settings restricting the resolution or bandwidth). The issue is clearly pixelation, not just a blurred image which could stem from wrong focus or a dirty lens.\nSo far, I found no way to get any insight into the internal processing between the webcam and MacOS (while the 3rd party Webcam Settings app does give me pretty sufficient control over all the features, it does not seem to show any debug info of any kind). Is there a way to find out, for example, whether the Mac \"thinks\" that the webcam only supports 720p? Or an option telling the Mac to go to the full resolution?\nIf it matters, I made sure to connect it with a direct and original Apple USB-C <-> USB-C cable (normally I'm going through a USB hub), but that makes no difference.\n\nA: The resolution between the camera and macOS is not as such negotiated and fixed at the time the camera is connected to the computer. Instead, every time a program requests access to a camera, they can also request for a specific resolution or various other features that cameras provide.\nUnfortunately that level of functionality is only for supported cameras. For non-supported cameras you get the default settings that is baked into the camera - it is thus not really changeable by the operating system, as there's no set standard for communicating settings to the cameras (such as changing field of view, applying HDR, AI autoframing, etc).\nSome programs have an \"info\" button or menu item that gives you information on the camera resolution in use - but not all of them. Some times you can save the camera image, and then look at the resulting image file to see the resolution.\nIn general, support for a specific camera usually comes in the form of a driver and/or a small application that allows you to change settings. For your camera this application is known as the Dell Peripheral Manager - and Dell explicitly writes on their web site and in their data sheet that this is not supported for macOS.\nSo basically Dell isn't writing software for their camera for macOS, so you're stuck with the default settings within the camera plus whatever third parties can \"reverse engineer\" and trick the camera into doing without vendor support. It's really too bad as the camera's design is heavily inspired by Apple's iSight camera, so you would think that it was intended for Macs as well.\nFrom my experience this means you're basically stuck with 1080p on that camera. As far as I know, the only program that can enable 4k on this camera is OBS. You might be able to use OBS to route the camera input into a new virtual camera that can then be used by other programs (such as for video conferencing). It is going to be complicated setup that requires extra CPU power for processing. I would consider returning the camera and buying a different one.\n", "Q: How to use monitors that connected to Mac mini as external monitor for Macbook Pro?

I started a new sheet using the \"Simple Budget\" template on the Mac. I edited the text values of the cells and changed the numbers' column format to be just Number.\nAll good but when I created a formula I noticed that some of the cells have a title or label, I assume pre-existing in the template. So for example, my formula is\n=B3 * B2 / 100\nbut what I get is actually\n=Income::B3 * B2 / 100\nThe text \"Income\" is nowhere (that I can see) in my current spreadsheet, and I can't find a way to edit this cell label or title, where do I change that?\n\nA: Figured it out.\nMy formula gets the table title when I reference a cell from an external table in a formula. Table titles were not visible (Table Options > activate Title to see it) and that table was called Income, thus the reference in my formula.\nI see now that I can change the title of the table, and that reference will always be there if I call a cell in a formula inside another table.\n", "Q: Limitations of iCloud+ own domain What are the limitations of iCloud+ own domain in regard to emails?\n\nUse Custom Email Domain with iCloud Mail\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212514\n\nI am looking for:\n\n*\n\n*a single domain which I already own\n\n*3 email boxes for 3 family members (me, partner, kid)\n\n*two emails that is forwarded somewhere else (grandparents use a different email but share our domain, could be 2 extra email boxes if forwarding without an email box is not supported)\n\n*15 aliases for my own email (I have many aliases yeah)\n\nEverything looks straightforward (MX, TXT, setup) but I need to know in advance before I commit to the change. Google Apps free tier is closing and I am not interested in buying Google's full package - I only use Gmail and YouTube.\nI read that there might be limitation of 5 domains (okay), 3 accounts (are these email boxes?) and 3 aliases (what?). That is really weird.\nThanks!\n\nA: I would plan that you lose all aliases you don’t assign and have strictly three aliases per user for a total of 15 distinct mail addresses.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/add-a-custom-domain-mma473945269/icloud\nI won’t be moving my work / consulting domain off of Fastmail since I need more than three aliases. I will likely make a personal domain since iCloud has this new feature.\nMy hunch is Apple won’t budge for at least a year on increased domains and aliases but would if lots of people use it and hit the limit regularly over a period of a year.\n\n*\n\n*One domain for the entire family.\n\n*Max of five members in the family\n\n*Max of three emails per iCloud account in the family.\n\n\nA: I would like to add a couple of other limitations not mentioned. For a custom domain transfer from another provider, Apple will not download your old messages stored on your previous provider's server over to iCloud. It also won't assign it to its own mailbox in the mail app, which creates two issues.\nFirst, there's a possibility of losing your stored messages if didn't keep a local copy of them or relied on a web based mail client. To solve this, create another mail app account for your custom domain, if you don't have one already, and use it to connect to your current mail provider. Check your mail and make sure your account is set to read all old and new messages. It may take a while if you have a lot of mail, but when it's done, all your old mail should be stored in its mailbox.\nSecond, since both your iCloud email address and your custom domain are on the same account, they are filed under the same mailbox. This makes it easy to confuse the two email addresses when replying and composing messages. It also makes it difficult to keep separate setting for each. So far, the best you can do is to create a special rule to file them into separate folders, which is less than ideal and won't isolate the two accounts.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 11,3 message: unplug the accessory using too much power to reenable usb devices MacBook Pro 11,3 message: \"unplug the accessory using too much power to reenable usb devices\"\nHow do I get more power to the usb?\n\nA: You can't.\nThe mere fact that you are seeing the message means that the MacBook Pro's USB port cannot support the amount of power required by the device.\nAs mmmmmm said in his comment, it may be possible to plug it into an externally powered USB hub that can also plug into your Mac. However, if a device uses too much power for your Mac's USB ports, there is no way around it.\n", "Q: \"cpan install\" trying to use /sw/bin/tar (instead of /usr/bin/tar) I'm having no luck getting CPAN modules to install on my M1 Mac running Big Sur.  They all seem to be trying to use /sw/bin/tar to untar the archives, but there is nothing there; tar is in /usr/bin/tar.  Mac OS does not want me to create anything like /sw, so I can't create a link to it there or anything.\nThe two modules I'm trying right now are GD and Imager, no luck on either.\nWho knows what additional problems I'll run into after this is solved, but right now I can't get past this point.\n\nA: The location of the tar binary used by cpan is defined in ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm (together with all other binaries required).

I have a Samsung SCX-4828FN network printer which on my older Intel Mac's are able to detect both as Printer and Scanner. When I open Image Capture, the scanner is dispalyed.\nOn my new M1 MBP however, while the printer is found on the network (and I'm able to print); I cannot see the device as a scanner in the Image Capture app.\nDoes anyone know why this is and how I could resolve?\n\nA: Not sure if this will help your situation or not but I had a Samsung SCX-4263. It broke printing and scanning when I bought my M1 Macboook air. I installed the Samsung Universal Printer and Scanner Driver (https://driverfresh.com/en/printers/samsung/3-universal-driver.html) and then selected Samsung M2060 driver. This one is the most common for abandoned Samsung/HP printers. It fixed both my printing and scanning. Hope this helps and post back here if it works! :)\n\nA: If I can’t find a first party scanner driver, my first stop has been VueScan for quite some time.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.hamrick.com/\nThe reason a device won’t show on recent OS typically the driver isn’t standard and/or Apple didn’t include it in updates or upgrades.\n", "Q: Meaning of when a process in \"ps -el\" output does not show full path to executable? On Catalina v10.15.7, I am using:\n\nps -el\n\nto investigate all running processes.\nI have 430 running processes. Ignoring those associated with open terminals, I'd like to understand why these 6 processes do not have the full path to their executable file listed when using ps -el:\naslmanager, auditd, autofsd, cloudphotod, endpointsecurityd, SafeEjectGPUAgent\naslmanager and auditd are in /usr/sbin, and yet /usr/sbin/syslogd, /usr/sbin/notifyd, and 31 other running processes from /usr/sbin do have their full path listed in ps -el output.\nautofsd and endpointsecurityd are both located in /usr/libexec, yet 97 other running processes located in /usr/libexec do have their full paths listed.\nThere seems to be aliasing going on with cloudphotod and SafeEjectGPUAgent for executable files in the context of ps -el output.\nI'd like to learn anything about the ps -el output exceptions when full file paths are not displayed to the executable.\n\nA: It's not really a case of output exceptions inside the ps command.\nWhat ps does is that it lists all the processes - and in particular it prints out the first element of the so called argv for each process. By convention the first element contains the name of the executable - but it is not actually required to be that way.\nDescribed roughly, when you for example start a program in the Terminal by typing this command:\n/usr/bin/less document.txt\n\nThe shell (for example zsh or bash) will perform some variant of exec() to ask the operating system to run that process. exec() takes a number of parameters - namely first and foremost the path and name of the program to run (/usr/bin/less) - and a list of arguments for the program to process. The first argument is by convention the name of the program itself - and so the shell will usually put whatever you wrote to start the program in there. The second argument is \"document.txt\" in this example.\nSo with less running, you can run ps -el in another terminal, and you'll see the process and it will be listed as /usr/bin/less.\nHowever, if you instead type this in the Terminal:\ncd /usr/bin/\n./less ~/document.txt\n\nYou'll find that running ps -el in another Terminal now lists the process as being simply ./less.\nSo that's the reason why some programs lists a full path and some do not. It is simply because of how they were originally started.\nIf you now run\n", "Q: Mouseover suddenly not working my MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019, Intel x86_64) with macOS 12.1 Monterey seems to be encountering a very strange issue. Normally, when you move your mouse over a button in Chrome, or a menu button item, etc., the button will change its color, and depending on the exact area, perhaps the mouse cursor shape will change (for example, the icon over a link will change from an arrow to a pointing finger). Neither of these is happening for me for a few days now. I have no idea what might have caused this. Among other annoying effects, this means the \"Automatically show and hide Dock\" option doesn't work - the Dock is always hidden. The issue occurs both on my external USB mouse and my built-in trackpad.\n\nA: It seems to have resolved itself for now by resetting NVRAM and SMC, and rebooting. No idea which of these steps actually did the trick.\n", "Q: CoreMediaIO appears to have turned my camera on Macbook Pro (Mid 2012) Catalina 10.15.7\nMy camera came on this morning. It's still on.

When i tried to kill AXVisualSupportAgent the camera did not go off, and it instantly restarted.\n\n\nA: CoreMediaIO is Apple's low-level framework that enables developers to interact with audio/video devices such as for example web cameras.\nUsually, developers will use the AVFoundation framework to work with audiovisual data I/O on a Mac. However, it is quite high-level framework, so if a developer requires low-level, direct access for performance reasons, it is possible to \"skip\" AVFoundation and talk directly to CoreMediaIO.\nIn either case, the CoreMediaIO framework governs access to the web camera - and the frameworks code will run on your CPU in order to get video data from the camera to your applications.\nThe CoreMediaIO framework comes with macOS in the standard installation.\nThe particular file you're referring to (VDC) is responsible for handling USB connected web cameras. The name itself means USB Video Device Class, which is a part of the USB specification that standardises communication with web cameras. This is probably more commonly known as UVC.\nThe Terminal output you have is unfortunately cropped (i.e. only parts of the process names are actually listed) - but it looks like the processes you have found are probably Google Chrome and avconferenced. The latter is a part of macOS and governs access to audiovisual devices - so this will be used by for example FaceTime, SideCar and other macOS built-in features.\nNow, you ask if it is possible that you have installed a trojan hack. It could be possible - depends on what you have actually done ofcourse. But there's nothing in your question that indicates or proves that this is the case.\nLittle Snitch is used to monitor and control network access. A webcam of this sort (USB) is not considered a network device in that respect, and is in that way completely out of reach of Little Snitch.\nI would suggest simply trying to close down some of your running programs to see when the webcam stops being used. Start by ensuring that FaceTime is not running, and look through your Google Chrome tabs for a web site using the camera. Close down Google Chrome and check if that solves it.\n", "Q: Does Music.app count plays and skips from other devices synced with the library? I use a MacBook Pro and Music.app on it. I also use my Android with Apple Music downloaded, and have an active Apple Music subscription to sync the two devices. However, in the \"Songs\" tab of Music.app, there are columns for plays and skips.\nDoes Apple Music or Music.app on my MacBook count skips and plays from my phone, and/or vice versa?\n\nA: For the Music.app portion, yes. When you sync your phone, it'll merge play counts, skip counts, and last played/skipped data with the information in your music library, for songs you have downloaded to your library.\nNote that some versions of the Music app on Monterey don't properly record play and skip information when playing music through the app itself, but they continue to update with the phone's information whenever you sync your phone.\n", "Q: MBP with Separate Bluetooth Module I have a MacBook Pro 13.3\" - Mid 2017 (A1708). I've been told by my local Mac repairer that this model has a separate bluetooth module (from the main wifi board) & that it's near impossible to fix or replace & would be 'horrendously expensive' to do so. This essentially means the value of my MBP has dropped considerably (I was in the process of selling it to upgrade). I know you can use a bluetooth dongle but that doesn't help or improve the sell price. Very disappointed as it's my first Mac. Not sure that I want to buy another Mac now.\n\nA: Is there something wrong with your Bluetooth module since you think it would have an impact on the resell price? - I would suggest taking it to one or two alternative repair shops to get their take on what it would cost to fix.\nAs far as I know, the A1708 models use the same IC for both WiFi and Bluetooth, and they use the same part for the WiFi and Bluetooth antenna (combined with the vents). It's not a separate module.\nI just did a quick search for a complete logic board replacement spare part for the A1708 - I'm not sure it's your exact model, but this was priced at $225. This includes the WiFi and Bluetooth IC.\n", "Q: How do you get airpods pro to play/pause on macos with single squeeze?

I tried mass deleting, but I always seem to find more in my Finder.\nI want to know where these files came from (why 2020?), whether it's even safe to delete these files (don't want to mess up anything on my Mac itself) and if so, how to delete all of them. I tried looking on multiple sites including here but didn't find anything that fixed my issue.\n\nA: These C/C++/Objective-C header files (.h) are likely embedded with framework bundles. They are harmless but should not be removed.\nRemoving these files can break code signatures and leave your applications unable to pass macOS security checks, such as Gatekeeper.\n\nA: If you didn't manually add them, then some app that you use must have installed them. So assuming that you still have that app installed, they should be left alone.\nApps that use installers to set themselves up should be removed using an uninstaller, if available, or directions from the developer.\nIt's also worth noting that they are very small. Even a thousand of them would take about the same space as one song in iTunes.\n", "Q: Finding the App Store page for an installed app I have this app that hasn't been updated for a while and when I search for it in the App Store, all that comes up are similar apps or at best the same app, but the version specifically for iPad.

This would include if this works differently in other versions of iOS as well.\n\nA: This works at least in iOS 14:\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store app.\n\n*Go to your App Store user account. Currently in iOS 14, this resides in the upper right and the symbol for your user on your device.\n\n*Select \"Purchases\", then \"My purchases\".\n\n*Enter the name of your app in the search field, or if you have few apps in your account just scroll down if needed and look for it.\n\n*Make sure the app is one you got installed by looking to the right of it in the list. If there is a download symbol there, it's not currently installed. If it says \"open\" in the same place, it is installed.\n\n*Hold down on the app in this list and a quick preview page will pop up.\n\n*To get the actual page just tap in the quick preview page.\n\nThe benefit over just searching the App Store is that you can know you've found the correct app and not one that has a similar name or is another alternative or variant from the developer. Possibly it might also show apps that aren't listed under the developer name, but that still has its page in the store.\nI couldn't find the info for this question when searching, then stumbled on a solution tapping around, so posted this for anyone else needing to know.\n\nA: *\n\n*Hold on the app icon of your choice\n\n*Select \"Share App\"\n\n*In the share sheet, select \"Copy link\"\n\n*Open Safari\n\n*Paste to Safari address bar and go\n\nThere you go.

My Macbook Pro has been running with really high memory recently, I think it might be what's caused the whole system to freeze 2 or 3 times over the last couple of weeks. I'll have a bunch of apps open then, maybe it's just that? But I don't think my usage habits have changed in the last 6 months (in fact previously I've done a lot of heavy RAM things, like working with large data sets / ML), and I wasn't experiencing any kind of freezing.\nBy \"freezing\" I mean that the whole system locks up, can't move mouse etc., display is still on, and it takes ~10secs to come back. Once it didn't come back and I had to do a hard restart.\nSet up:\n\nLooking at the Activity Monitor, the programs there definitely aren't using the 14GB of Memory Used, but from other articles here I see that this is normal. Maybe the high memory pressure isn't normal though.

Would high memory pressure cause the kinds of freezing that i've experienced? Any fixes?\nThanks,\n\nA: As per @benwiggy's suggestion, I investigated which programmes were causing high RAM usage: it was Google Chrome. I have installed Microsoft Edge, which has all the features of Chrome (same extensions, appearance settings etc.) but doesn't hog memory.

In an attempt to salvage any data on the phone I wanted to connect it to my Macbook via USB cable. When I do so, there is a prompt on the computer to 'allow this device' to do something or other, and another prompt on the phone to 'Trust This Computer'. The issue is that the lower section of the screen that is damaged will not respond to input, so I am unable to finish the connection by pressing the prompt.\nIs there way to turn off some setting that will automatically allow the device to connect to my Macbook? Or another way to salvage the data on the phone? I don't want to invest in a new screen as the phone is really old, and it would be a waste of money.\n\nA: When your iPhone display fails you still might be able to control it via Voice Control.\nTrigger Siri and say \"Enable Voice Control\".\nYou can then trigger \"screen taps\" by saying \"show grid\" and saying the numbers shown on screen.

There appears to be a rogue DHCP server on our office LAN, occasionally preempting the DHCP server on our router, and assigning addresses that are owned by fixed servers.\nI see all sorts of rogue DHCP detectors for WinDoze, but what about for Macintosh? (A Google search for \"rogue DHCP detection macintosh\" gets mostly false-positives, picking up \"MAC Address\").\n\nA: The best way to find this on your network is to sniff the traffic via a program like Wireshark.\nFilter your Wireshark traffic for BOOTP traffic.  Find the DHCP offer requests and find the one that doesn't match your official DHCP server.\nFrom there you're going to have to find out how it's connected to your network which depends on your network topology.\n\nA: I found my rogue DHCP server: it's the cable modem (whose DHCP function is supposedly turned off!).\nThe cable modem is an Arris DG1670A; the router/firewall is a TP-Link WDR-4300.\nFollowing the comment from \"hohillside,\" I went into System Preferences this morning, when my iMac came up \"bottled,\" and found that its DHCP address had been vended by the cable modem's address (192.168.0.1), rather than by the TP-Link's address (192.168.1.1).\nThen, seeing that the cable modem's DHCP address range is 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.254, I brought up my Chromebook, which almost always comes up \"bottled\" here, and sure enough, it came up \"bottled,\" and the address it had been given wasn't a collision with a fixed address (e.g., 192.168.1.103) at all, but an address that's evidently not allowed in the office LAN: 192.168.0.103.\nSo now, the problem is figuring out why, with DHCP unchecked on the cable modem setup page, it's still serving DHCP, and/or what to do about it.\n", "Q: Can I clone an external hard drive bit for bit, incrementally? I have an external USB hard drive with many encrypted APFS volumes on it.\nI have a second identical external USB hard drive.\nIs there a macOS program that lets me clone the first to the second without mounting the encrypted volumes, and in a incremental way (e.g. subsequent copies only copy the changes)?\nI think all macOS based back up programs are like rsync in that they operate on the files (not on disk's).\nDisk Util has \"Restore\", but this copies a lot of data if I have only changed a few bytes.\n\nA: No, what you ask is simply not possible - given that you mean the usual things by \"mount\" and \"incremental\".\nAn unmounted, encrypted volume is in simple terms roughly indistinguishable from a bunch of random bytes. There's no way to tell from this volume alone whether any block of data is \"changed\" or not.\nYou can definitely copy the data from one drive to the other. That's just a question of doing a bit-for-bit copy using a program such as the built-in dd command in macOS.\nIf you bend the usual understanding of working with non-mounted disks - and imagine a program that would decrypt the volume (given you had the password), parse the file system, and use timestamps, snapshots or another method of finding the changes and map those back to the source bytes - then yes, theoretically you could create such a tool. However at that point you could just as well have mounted the drive.\nYou could also bend the usual understanding of incremental backups - and imagine a program that reads through all of the source drive while reading through all of the destination drive - and then copy over only what has been changed. It would be almost trivial to make, but I don't recall any macOS program doing this. On Linux you could use programs such as diskrsync and Bscp to do this - although both are build to transfer the disk to a remote computer, you could have both the local and remote computer be the same. I don't know if these programs can be compiled and successfully used on macOS, but if you want to build your own tool, you could do it by porting over diskrsync.\nThis would make sense if you have a drive where reads are fast and writes are slow. It would stil be a very slow proces compared to usual incremental backup tools, such as for example Time Machine, where the set of changes can be calculated quickly by looking at the source volume only.\nThere are other tools out there for cloning disks and trying to make that process faster. For example the partclone_apfs program makes it possible to clone APFS file systems from disk to disk - copying only the blocks that actually contain data. If the volume has a lot of free disk space when mounted, this will speed the process up considerably. However, it does not work for encrypted volumes.\nFinally, you could imagine up solutions that worked by tracking changes using snapshots on the local drive. As that would mean modifying the drive you're trying to clone, this would usually not be an option.\n", "Q: Installing macOS on an external SSD fails (m1) When trying to install MacOS on an external SSD, the internal SSD is always booted when restarting.\nWhen I select the external SSD in the bootloader, it only shows that the installation is corrupt. In the MacOS installer there is an option to select the disk on which you want to install MacOS. I just selected the external SSD. There is also a menu on M1 macs where you can decide from which SSD you want to boot from. Just hold the power bottom for like 15 seconds until it shows up. You can also configure a standard startup disk in your MacOS system preferences or in the mentioned boot loader.\nI watched some YouTube videos about it and it worked for them. They are able to install MacOS on multiple drives and select from which there wanna boot. I want to archive this to because of my work I need different installations.\nCan anyone help me installing MacOS on a external drive? Do you think there is a solution or is this more of a Mac bug?\n\nA: Since your Mac is M1 be sure you are installing Big Sur or Monterey on the external drive first.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/22/booting-an-m1-mac-from-an-external-disk-it-is-possible/\nIf you need older OS, you’ll have to use hardware that can run the older installers or work on virtualization / emulation modifications.\n", "Q: How can I use an external HDD for both Time Machine and other data? Many years ago, I set up an external USB HDD as a Time Machine volume. I don't know whether I did anything special at the time (and this answer indicates I didn't), but I've been using it as both a regular external HDD to store stuff, and as a backup volume (Backups.backupdb/ folder) all this time.\nWhen I tried to set up a new external HDD that I recently bought, it looked like it needs to be a dedicated HDD for Time Machine only. Time Machine Preference Pane did not allow me to use the existing volume, but insisted on deleting the volume and starting over, and then Finder showed it as read-only even outside of Backups.backupdb.\nHow can I set up an external HDD as Time Machine backup volume while allowing me to use it as a normal external HDD?\n\nA: According to Apple's documentation:\n\nAPFS or APFS Encrypted disks are the preferred format for a Time Machine backup disk. If you select a new backup disk that’s not already formatted as an APFS disk, you get the option to erase and reformat it. If the disk is a Mac OS Extended format disk that contains an existing Time Machine backup, you aren’t asked to erase and reformat the disk.\nNote: The entire APFS volume is reserved for Time Machine backups. If you want to store files other than the Time Machine backup on the same physical device, use Disk Utility to create an additional APFS volume on the disk. The two volumes then share the available space.\n\nSo the problem is that, for a new external HDD, Time Machine requires an APFS formatted volume, and APFS volumes cannot be used for Time Machine and user data. This is a change from earlier versions of Mac OS that supported only HFS+ for Time Machine backups, and explains why Mac OS lets you store both data and Time Machine backups on the old HDD: it's not APFS formatted.\nTo use the HDD for both your data and Time Machine, create an additional APFS volume, using one for data, and the other for Time Machine. Alternatively, you could try setting up a Time Machine folder structure on an HFS+ volume on an older version of Mac OS, so that Big Sur and newer let you reuse that volume for backups.\n", "Q: Reclaim lost space on disk (reverting back From bootcamp) ​Long story short, I was attempting to get rid of Bootcamp and somehow botched it so I can't get into either Windows or macOS anymore.

If a panic log was put on something like paste bin or given to a third party, could its contents contain personal info/compromise the security of my system?\n\nA: What is confidential is relative - something might be confidential information for you, and for others it might not be. It is therefore entirely subjective.\nSo yes, in that sense, a panic log could contain confidential information.\nHowever, if you by \"panic log\" mean a simple kernel panic message, then no - most ordinary users would not find that to be confidential information. Nor would they consider it as containing personal information or compromise the security of your system.\nIf you want to be completely pedantic about it - yes, there's an ever so slight risk of something you think is important being loaded into a register at just the time of the kernel panic. I.e. a register could in theory contain an IP address or perhaps 8 characters of your password. The latter being very improbably. However, they would look more or less indistinguishable from random bytes to an outside observer.\nSo - are you an home user battling a problem with a hardware peripheral causing kernel panics every now and then - and is requested to send the kernel panic to that manufacturer's support team - I wouldn't be worried at all.\nBut if you happen to have state secrets all over your computer and you are directly targeted by a foreign state that can trigger your computer to kernel panic at the most unfortunate times over and over again - while that enemy can read your kernel panics, but not otherwise what's display on your monitor - then yes, I would be slightly worried.\n\nA: Possibly, but it is very unlikely that enough information would be captured to provide much meaningful information. The kernel panic captures details about instructions occurring at the CPU. Apple has an old but detailed (and still relevant) explanation of how to interpret the panic log, here: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2063/_index.html\n", "Q: sudo ownership and permission changed and shows `sudo: /usr/local/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set` I made another admin account in my MacOS Monterey for my programming job.\nThen I had to change ownership of Homebrew directories to make it work.\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Homebrew/ /usr/local/var/homebrew /Library/Homebrew/ /usr/local/Cellar\n\nWhen I came back to my main account, Homebrew doesn't work. so I decide to to delete the new account and change the ownership of directories back to my main account.\nthe problem starts when I ran the following command and I need to revert it back.\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr\n\nafter that sudo command doesn't work and shows following exception:\n➜  ~ sudo vi x.t\nsudo: /usr/local/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set\n\nhere is the sudo permissions:\n➜  ~ ls -l /usr/bin/sudo                 \n-r-s--x--x  1 root  wheel  1246544  8 Dec 10:39 /usr/bin/sudo\n\nI activated the root account to change permissions but it doesn't work.\nI also reinstalled the OS but there is no success.\nI tried to replace /usr directory with my friend /usr directory with the same OS but the directory and it's file are read only.\nI could not change things in Recovery Mode Terminal.\nPlease advice.\n\nA: You messed up the ownership of /usr/local/bin/sudo, but /usr/bin/sudo is ok so you can use that to repair the other:\n/usr/bin/sudo root /usr/local/bin/sudo\n\nThere are probably other problems, since you changed ownership of all of /usr instead of just the relevant directories. But be specific and careful when making repairs -- it seems like you're in a vicious cycle where each attempt to repair a problem just creates even bigger problems (and if you'd succeeded in replacing /usr, that would have created bigger problems). Do not try to fix things by hitting them with bigger and bigger hammers, that just makes bigger and bigger messes.\nP.s. Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/349/\n\nA: Basically Homebrew is designed for a one user machine.\nIt needs its directory (On Intel /usr/local/bin) writeable by that user and the install instructions do that by making that user own the directory. Now under Unix you can't have two users owning the same directory.\nThe normal Unix way (as done for 40 years) for installing software to be used by multiple users is to install into a directory owned by root or a special user for installing. Thus all users can run the executables but you have to have sudo rights to update things. (My view is that you update much less often than run the executables so this is not a problem)\nFor Macs there are several other package managers that stick to the normal Unix way and I would use one of them e.g. MacPorts, conda, fink, nix\n", "Q: Can I run my laptop directly from an external battery at full throttle while charging my iPhone from the laptop at the same time?

Googling finds plenty of material on units that can recharge a laptop, but I am not sure if they recharge a laptop running at full power, say doing a numerical calculation while watching YouTube via USB hotlinking to 4G with my iPhone which is also being recharged via USB.\nOf course the above scenario is the worst case, but it could conceivably happen on a long train ride after a busy day.\nI am often moving around a lot and even on public transportation and simply can not plug in to mains power as frequently as I would like.\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2020)\n\n*1.1 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5\n\n*Intel Iris Plus Graphics 1536 MB\n\n*macOS 10.15.7\n\n*iPhone SE-2\n\n\nA: What will tell you if a power bank is capable of charging your laptop under load is how much power it can provide vs. power the laptop consumes.  How do you know how much power your laptop consumes?  The size of the power supply that came with the laptop should give some idea as Apple will size the power supply to the power demands of the laptop.\nHow can you know how much power a power bank can provide?  You will have to look closely at the specifications.  If you are lucky then the manufacturer will spell that out clearly for you.  If you can't find that spelled out for you then you can do some math on the specs you can find.  Volts times amps equals watts.  If you can find volts and amps then you can get power.\nIt also helps to keep in mind the USB-C specs on power delivery as that will at least provide a sanity check on the numbers you get.  USB Power Delivery 3.0 is limited to 100 watts, 20 volts at 5 amps, so most power banks will not exceed that.  USB Power Delivery 3.1 is still quite new but if you do happen to find a power bank that meets this spec then it is possible to see the power bank supply up to 240 watts.\nAnother rule to keep in mind about USB Power Deliver is that it does not allow for more current than 5 amps.  If some power and voltage combination adds up to more than 5 amps then check your numbers, there's likely an error somewhere.\nGiven the growth in power consumption of laptops lately it is quite possible you won't find a power bank that is powerful enough for your needs, the market just hasn't had enough time to catch up.

In most single-line text edit fields, pressing Up moves the cursor to the start of the line, and pressing Down moves the cursor to the end. But in the Messages app, the behaviour is slightly different; it seems to consider 3 positions: the start of the line, something like the last location of the cursor, and the end of the line, and pressing Up / Down cycles through these (so e.g. pressing Up then Down returns the cursor to the same position).\nI can see some logic to this for people who press Up or Down accidentally and want a quick way back to their old place, but I find it jarring since I'm used to the standard home/end behaviour.

I'm not sure if this is Messages-specific, or something more general (though I haven't seen any other apps show this behaviour).\nDemonstration of different behaviours (if the video doesn't play, click it to open in a new window; seems imgur prevents looping gifs):\n\n\nA: Up/down arrow is 'previous line/next line'. It will use the same position in the line, if such exists; once at the top or bottom line it will then become 'home & end' but only in that one instance.

I have noted and dated these backups, so I can reset back to an earlier date knowing exactly what state the Mac would be in. I find this much more useful than hourly backups as the changes made between each manual backup are far more significant than a few files changed between a few hours or days.\nI am aware that if I set Time Machine to backup automatically, the earliest backup would eventually be overwritten. Provided I do not fill the time machine with backups, is there any way I can preserve a backup e.g. by copying it to another drive? Would a backup last forever or does it have an expiry date? Could I also choose individual backups to delete to preserve older ones?\n\nA: There is absolutely no point in doing this. TM is an incremental backup, which you can use to restore an earlier 'state' of your Mac at any given time.\nIf only one file changes in one hour, then TM only adds that one file. And there is consolidation of the hourly backups every 24 hours.\nYes, the first backup will get deleted when the disk is full, but of course that will only affect the 'delta' between that backup and the next.\nIf you want to archive permanent images of your data, I would recommend using SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner.\n", "Q: Safari 15 for Mac hangs / freezes on launch Within a few seconds to a couple minutes of launching, Safari (version 15.2 on macOS Catalina 10.15.7) freezes with a “wait” cursor (beach ball). Even if I open to an empty start page and just let it sit there, it quickly freezes. I’ve tried all the following with no success in fixing it:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Safari in “safe mode” to disable extensions by holding shift, then clicking Safari’s icon in the Mac Dock.\n\n*Suggestions from Apple’s “If Safari on Mac doesn't open a webpage or isn’t working as expected” article:\n\n*\n\n*Check for software updates.\n\n*Test using a private browsing window.\n\n*Confirm that network connection works.\n\n\n\n*Delete all Safari extensions.\n\n*Restart my Mac.\n\n*Clear all Safari history.\n\n*Delete all stored site data (Safari preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data > Remove All).\n\nOne troubleshooting step yielded a clue: I created a new user profile for my Mac in System Preferences, logged into that user, declined to sign into iCloud, and then launched Safari. Safari worked normally there, suggesting that there was a problem specifically with my Safari data in my Mac user profile, or possibly with my iCloud data.\nI tried removing various files under ~/Library that looked Safari-related, but no luck. (Unfortunately, most of the Safari troubleshooting pages that I’ve found were written for old versions of Safari, so the files they suggest trashing aren’t always where they claim.)\nHow can I fix this constant crashing?\n\nA: The culprit was a large (over 3,600) number of links stored in Safari’s “Reading List” causing Safari to hit an open thread limit. The solution was to delete my entire reading list. Read on for details:\nI could not reproduce the crash when launching Safari with my network connection disabled, suggesting that Safari was hanging on some kind of network request.\nLooking at the crash report that I was prompted to send to Apple yielded the answer. I noticed two things in the crash report:\n\n*\n\n*An error message saying “Dispatch Thread Hard Limit: 512 reached … too many dispatch threads blocked in synchronous operations”\n\n*Tons of open threads mentioning com.apple.network.boringssl.metrics_queue\nSearching the web for com.apple.network.boringssl.metrics_queue turned up this bug report for NetNewsWire.\n\nMy guess: Apple’s doing some kind of metrics report on each feed download. But, if you have 1,000 feeds (or some large number), and Apple’s metric calls are slow to complete, then you could hit that 512 limit\n\nThinking about what mass group of URLs Safari might be fetching in the background, I thought about Reading List. Even wiping all my Safari data in ~/Library, which I had already tried, might not prevent this, because iCloud could just re-synchronize my Reading List as soon as it had a network connection. The solution was to clear the Reading List for all my devices.\nHere’s how I cleared my Reading List while maintaining a backup of my stored links. Instructions are for Safari 15.2 on macOS 10.15.7:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari.\n\n*Open Finder, then choose “Go -> Go to Folder…” from the menu bar\n\n*Type in ~/Library/Safari and click “Go”.\n\n*Copy these files to your desktop: ~/Library/Safari/AutomaticBookmarksBackup.html and Bookmarks.plist. These files contain human- and machine-friendly copies of your Safari bookmarks and Reading List links. Keep these files so that you still have a copy of your Reading List links after we delete them from Safari.\n\n*Turn off wifi, or otherwise disable your Mac’s network connection.\n\n*Launch Safari.\n\n*Open Reading List.\n\n*Switch to showing all items, both read and unread.\n\n*Right click a Reading List item, then click “clear all”.\n\n*Turn on wifi. This should cause Reading List to be deleted on all your devices signed into your iCloud account. (Provided they have enabled Safari synchronization in iCloud preferences.)\n\nNote that the AutomaticBookmarksBackup.html file does not preserve the read/unread status of the reading list links, although maybe you could find that information in the .plist file. Or, if you don’t care about preserving already-read links, delete those first, then backup the AutomaticBookmarksBackup.html file, then delete the rest.\n", "Q: Why I can no longer create *separate* Gmail Desktop apps?

I couldn't find anything that worked so instead I used another browser (I used Microsoft edge) to do the same thing instead of Chrome.\nFollow this link\nhttps://www.maketecheasier.com/access-gmail-on-your-desktop/\nIt'll run through how to do it with Microsoft edge.\nI reckon as the other browser doesn't have multiple log ins the app doesn't automatically switch to the default account.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Why is htop and Activity Monitor showing different even when running htop as sudo? I have installed htop using homebrew on an M1 Macbook Air. Below, one can see that the used memory reported by htop and Activity Monitor are different.\nI am aware of other answers in this website where people recommend htop to be invoked under sudo privileges: sudo htop. In theory, this should make them both match. However, the screenshot below was taken just after having invoked it under sudo.\nWhat am I missing?\n\n\nA: The two programs are simply displaying different things. One says \"Mem\" as an explanation and the other says \"Memory Used\" - they're not the same thing.\nIf you take values for \"App Memory\" and \"Wired Memory\" from Activity Monitor and add them up, you get the same value as the \"Mem\" value in htop.\n", "Q: How do I search specific content in my recent files on MacOSX 12.1 (21C52)? Is there a way to search some string in file content, that I can narrow down the following filters:\n\n*\n\n*Recently created (< 20 days).\n\n*Text file (but not surely with a .txt extension).\n\n*Might be in any folder on this machine.\n\n\nA: What is a text file? That is a bit ambiguous. In terms of Spotlight metadata  I define it as having the public.text as one item in its kMDItemContentTypeTree metadata item.\nWith that you can search in Finder with something like this:\n\nJust enter your search string in the \"Search for:\" box.\nThe key (not obvious) item in this search is the Raw Query.\nFirstly it is not an obvious search criterion. To see \"Raw Query\" as a search criterion (like \"Name\" or \"Created Date\") choose \"Other\" in the drop down box and scroll down to \"Raw query\" and tick the In Menu selection.\n\nNow the magic bit. The raw query you need is kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.text\"cd\nI found this using the mdls Terminal command on a candidate for being a text file, like this:\nmdls /Users/gilby/Applications/KM/apptagset.sh\n_kMDItemDisplayNameWithExtensions      = \"apptagset.sh\"\nkMDItemContentCreationDate             = 2022-01-22 06:05:07 +0000\nkMDItemContentCreationDate_Ranking     = 2022-01-22 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemContentModificationDate         = 2022-01-22 06:05:07 +0000\nkMDItemContentModificationDate_Ranking = 2022-01-22 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemContentType                     = \"public.shell-script\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree                 = (\n    \"public.shell-script\",\n    \"public.script\",\n    \"public.source-code\",\n    \"public.plain-text\",\n    \"public.text\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.content\"\n)\nkMDItemDateAdded                       = 2022-01-22 06:05:07 +0000\nkMDItemDateAdded_Ranking               = 2022-01-22 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemDisplayName                     = \"apptagset.sh\"\nkMDItemDocumentIdentifier              = 0\n......\n\nYou may find that my raw query does not meet your definition of a text file - e.g. should that include .rtf (rich text files) files or not. You might prefer the raw query kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.plain-text\"cd because .rtf are public.text, but not public.plain-text.\nBut play with it a bit.\nFurther exploration:\nIn Terminal you can use the mdfind command to perform Spotlight queries. Like this:\nmdfind '(kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.text\"cd && (kMDItemFSCreationDate >= \"$time.today(-20d)\" && kMDItemFSCreationDate < \"$time.today(+1d)\"))'\nIf you find this just too excruciating, I recommend the (not free) GUI app HoudahSpot which makes this relatively easy:\n\nAnd it will tell me the raw query if I want to use it with mdls.\n\n", "Q: Changing language on ID3 lyrics eyeD3 has an add-lyrics option that takes arguments Lyrics, Description, Language.  Lyrics is supposed to be a filename, description a string, and language the three character code from ISO3166-2.  If all three are present, they are delimited by : (colon).\nUnfortunately, in MacOS zsh, the colon and the next word are treated as part of the filename, which means \"file not found.\"  Putting quotes around the filename causes eyeD3 to fail with a Usage message.\nIs there a way to change the language tag without also resetting the lyrics?  If I omit it, the default is \"eng.\"  I can still read the lyrics, so it's not a big deal, but it bugs me to have them all tagged \"eng\" when some are dut, ita, ell, por, spa, etc.\nTypical invocation:\neyeD3 --encoding utf8 --add-lyrics Lyrics.txt \\\n                                   filename.mp3 > /dev/null\n\n/dev/null redirect is because eyeD3 will list all tags (including lyrics) whether it changed them or not.  That is of course, quite long, but the issue is can be illustrated by a small part:\nLyrics: [Description: ] [Lang: eng]\nDit is de boodschap die Jeremia van de Here kreeg op het \n\nNow, according to the documentation, the way to fix that \"eng\" is to use\neyeD3 --encoding utf8 --add-lyrics Lyrics.txt:The Description:dut \\\n                                   filename.mp3 > /dev/null\n\nwhich, as I said, complains that there is no file named Lyrics.txt:The  Escaping the colon (… Lyrics.txt:The …) did not change anything.  Quoting the file name made it worse (usage message).\n\nA: As with any utility called from a shell, arguments which include characters with special meaning to the shell need to be quoted (' or \")  or escaped (\\).\neyeD3 --encoding utf8 --add-lyrics 'Lyrics.txt:The Description:dut' \\\n                                   filename.mp3 > /dev/null\n\nAt least according to the explanations in eyeD3 --help you can also run\neyeD3 --encoding utf8 --add-lyrics 'Lyrics.txt::dut' filename.mp3 > /dev/null\n\n\nA: Seems the problem is \"too many variables.\"\nThere is apparently no way to just change the language tag¹ without adding lyrics.  So:\nFirst, if there are (or may be) already lyrics in the file, you have to remove them, because --add-lyrics will do what it says: add to the lyrics already there.  So\neyeD3  --remove-all-lyrics  (audio-file)\n\nSecond, if you want to include a language, you must also have a description (but it can be blank).\neyeD3  --add-lyrics  (lyrics-file)::dut  (audio-file)\n\nThird, the lyrics file name must not depend on globbing.  The shell will try to glob the entire string up to the first white space.  So the shell (not eyeD3) will complain that there are no matches for lyrics*.txt::dut (for example).  So if you need to use wild cards:\nLYRICS=\"lyrics*.txt\"\neyeD3  --add-lyrics  $LYRICS::dut  (audio-file)\n\nFourth, the third example still doesn't work!  The shell will expand the variable in quotes but will not apply globbing.  It will be as if the asterisks were escaped.  So:\nLYRICS=\"$(ls lyrics*.txt)\"\neyeD3  --add-lyrics  $LYRICS::dut  (audio-file)\n\nFinally, if you try to add a description that contains any white space, eyeD3 will try to use whatever comes after the first white space as the target audio file.  To avoid that, use quotes:\neyeD3  --add-lyrics  \"$LYRICS:Dutch lyrics:dut\"  (audio-file)\n\nBut not single-quotes, because that prevents expansion of the $LYRICS.\n¹A fiie can contain more than one set of lyrics and eyeD3 is able to remove one, finding it by description.  So, if each had a different description, it should be possible to modify the python code to change the language code on the lyric that has a particular description.  Or to find the lyric that contains a search string and change the LANG on that.\n", "Q: When using screen sharing, how can I switch spaces on local machine while remote machine is in full screen? I want to keep a remote machine open in full screen and be able to switch to and from that space on my local machine. On my local machine I have f1 and f2 set to switch spaces, but all keyboard entries go to the remote machine so I have to exit full screen in order to access my local machine and switch spaces.\nf1 and f2 are not set to do anything on the local machine so I just get the \"this key doesn't do anything\" beep.\nIs there maybe a way to have some keys not forward to the remote machine and only register on the local machine? or am I missing something and there is another way to do this?\nBoth machines are running 12.1.\nEdit: I notice now that this happens even when not in full screen. if screen sharing is the app in focus all keyboard input goes to the remote machine. I have to use mouse to unfocus screen sharing in order for keyboard to interact with local machine.\n\nA: Solved-ish.

I found out that my iPhone 11 has 3 microphones.  As far as I know it's the bottom mic that is used for almost all input.  And the rear next to the camera for camera shots only.  But one thing remains, namely what sits in the earpiece.  But what exactly is it used for? Does anybody have an idea.\n\nA: I found a succinct description on MacRumors\n\n\nI would like to know which microphone is active with which app?\n\nAll three, all the time a mic is needed. One becomes the primary mic,\nand the other two are used for noise cancellation.\nAs for which mic becomes the primary, it's not app-dependent, but\nrather use-case dependent.\nIn regular phone mode, obviously the bottom mic is the primary, with\nthe rear mic used for noise cancellation. But when you switch to\nspeakerphone mode, the phone switches between the three mics depending\non where a clear, loud human voice is speaking relative to the phone,\nand how the phone is oriented. Same is true for when audio recording\napps are being used.\nFor video recording, and FaceTime: Primary mic depends on which camera\nis being used.

You might have other options based on your appetite for more command line work.\nOnce your Mac is in target disk mode, you can use finder to back up large files, delete files you don’t need and free up space.

This goes for both macOS (currently have 10.15.7) and iPadOS (currently have 15.1).\nMy Mac will constantly suggest whatever app I was using last on my iPhone or iPad when I press ⌘ + tab or look at the Dock. This is a minor annoyance, but if possible I'd like to get rid of it.\nMore serious is my iPad doing the same with apps from my iPhone or Mac. It replaces one of the three recently used apps on the right side of the Dock, but there's a delay, so I'll often see whatever recently used app is there, move my finger to press it, have it replaced by the Handoff suggestion from one of my other devices at the last moment, and accidentally open the Handoff-suggested app instead of the recently used app I wanted to open.\nThis is especially troublesome when the Handoff-suggested app is the same app as the recently used one (say, Numbers) but I was viewing different documents on my iPad and Mac, so the iPad closes the document I was viewing on it and opens the one from the Mac in its place.

System returns to the home screen.\n\nA: Mac OS X 10.5 does not have recovery mode. In versions 10.0 through 10.6, you got the equivalent of recovery mode by booting from the installer DVD. 10.7 didn't come on a DVD (it was downloaded via the App Store instead), so recovery mode was added to replace the DVD-boot option.\nIf you have the installer DVD for your iMac, insert that and hold C while turning on the iMac. If you don't have it... well, if you have another computer with a DVD-R writer, you might be able to find an image of the appropriate DVD (Archive.org has some) and burn it.\nNote: depending on the specific model of iMac you have, it might need a model-specific disc... and some of the images available may be model-specific for other models. If you can find your specific model of iMac on everymac.com, it'll list what version of Mac OS X was originally pre-installed on it; if that's 10.4 or earlier, you want a generic installer DVD. If it's 10.5, you may need a model-specific installer.\n(BTW, make sure you don't get the server version of Mac OS X.

There is only 1 table Assist in the file, which contains Identifier, LastSeedValue, LastUpdateTime and Version.\nNote: you can substitute the Sucheng for other Chinese input method names.\n", "Q: Host certain folder for public access via URL Hopefully I describe this in the way it can help me.\nIs it possible for me to host a drive live on a website of mine, in which users anywhere, (not just my network), can access to watch/listen/play and download stuff from?\nSimilarly to Snap2HTML, the application takes a snapshot of a folder's structure, and pastes it on a HTML file you can use for a website.\nMy desired result is just like this, but I can use it on MacOS systems, since Snap2HTML is Windows only. Being that, I did indeed test it on CrossOver, which it built the .html just fine, but I cannot redownload the files from where the .html was appointed to.\nEssentially, I want to host my own file hosting service, apart from anyone else uploading anything to the drive. Anyone who visits my site, can download those files I put into the drive, that looks like an Index of that drive, similarly to the Raspberry Pi OS' previous image UX.\nIf anything of the similar is possible and available for Mac, please let me know.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Most webservers have built-in support for this, including Apache which is pre-installed on macOS. Functionality like that is usually disabled because it might expose sensitive files; in Apache's case, you have to enable it explicitly with Options +Indexes. It updates live, which means you don't have to make a new snapshot if you add or remove files.\nHere is an example how it could look like:\n\n(from this Stack Overflow question)\n", "Q: Does redacting images in Preview using opaque shapes remove the original data from the resulting image file? The Preview application has a Markup toolbar, which allows drawing over the top of an image.  I was thinking about the possibility of using this feature to draw opaque shapes to redact sensitive  portions of an image.  My specific case is hiding names from a PNG screenshot.\nThis is on a version of macOS prior to Big Sur, so the \"Redact Selection\" option is not available in the app.\nMy intuition is that, as a raster-graphics image format, the resulting PNG wouldn't contain the redacted text even as non-visible image data.  This differs from something like a PDF, where the data is still present in a layer behind the redaction, and therefore recoverable by examining the file data.\nCan Preview be used in this manner to irrevocably remove sensitive information from a PNG image?\n\nA: \nSingle layer png file\nYes, so long as you're saving in .png or .jpg - something that won't save layers.\nTechnically, png can use layers, but Preview doesn't.\nOnce it's flattened to a single layer, the information underneath no longer exists.\nNote that due to an editing peculiarity of Preview, your redacting object remains movable even after the image is saved - but the saved version is already now a single layer. If you close & re-open you'll see the editable layer was only present 'live' in Preview for the time the original was open.\nThis will not work reliably on a pdf. The element used to redact will still be a movable object, if not in Preview, then in some 3rd party app. Different pdf viewers respect different security levels & you can always find one somewhere that will bypass any security you try to implement.\n\npng screenshot of multi-layered PDF original.\n\nA: Your reasoning is correct: in PDFs, you cannot redact like this, the text is still present. But with pure pixel formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc., drawing over the text will wipe out the original information, it will not be recoverable if you use a 100% opaque color.\n", "Q: VPN connection terminates: L2TP failed to set port-mapping for en0, errorCode: -65564 The following issue surfaced last week and I am not sure anymore if this happened before or after I upgraded to Monterey.\nI am using a VPN connection for work but since last week this connection only lasts for 60 to 90 seconds. In the first 60 seconds everything is working. The machine is connected and has internet. After these 60 seconds the internet connection stops working and around 30 seconds later the VPN client tells me that the VPN connection has been terminated.\nNow, after some trying around it was suggested to me to try to access the internet from another connection so I switched from my home router to a mobile hot spot.\nAnd there you go. With the mobile hot spot everything is working fine for hours.\nClearly, this makes the router the main suspect but I have been working with it for months now and since I didn't touch it, I find it hard to believe that it is the cause.\nI've searched the internet for this issue but I couldn't find anything useful. Is there anything I can do? At least to get more information about where this issue truly originates from?\nLogging output\nI took a look at the /var/log/ppp.log file and compared both cases.

Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Looking for a mail app that only sends email without receiving new ones My \"Problem\": Every time I want to send a quick email I end up screening my other mail by accident. As soon as I open Spark (or Mail or Edison or Gmail or Thunderbird), the app fetches all my new emails. My best option is to try to close the window as soon as possible, but likely I will screen my inbox and lose my focus. I know this is a real first-world problem, but it bothers me terribly.\nMy goal is to be less distracted by incoming emails. Ideally, I would have two mail apps. App 1 only sends emails all day long. The program can be open all day. App 2 will only be started manually by me every day at a certain time or when needed, but actively triggered by me. Like opening my letterbox. App 2 should then fetch all my emails so I can reply to them or archive/delete them all in one go.\nI tried to find the setting in Spark, Mail, Edison, and Thunderbird to stop fetching emails.\n\nA: If you don't want to be distracted then you can use following workflow:\n\n*\n\n*minimize Mail (⌘ + M)\n\n*for sending e-mail ⌘ + ⇥ to Mail app (app is minimized, so it's not pops up but becomes active)\n\n*use ⌘ + N to bring up new mail window\n\nThis way you don't see your Mail program main window, only window for new mail you are about to write. Of course, you have to set all notifications etc in a way that they don't distract you as well.\n", "Q: How to completely and mercilessly remove Emacs keybindings? Not your average keybinding question...\nIs there any way to completely and without mercy remove or unset the Emacs keybindings on the Mac?\nAfter much research I come to you with a problem and what I have learned:\nProblem -- I want my basic shortcuts (like copy & paste) to be like Windows, with the Control key instead of the Command key.\nI could swap the Modifier keys in Keyboard Settings. But this is problematic for me, because much of the time I'm remoting into Windows machines. When I swap the modifier keys on the iMac system, they are reversed again as soon as I remote into Windows.\nSo what I have done instead is to add custom shortcuts in Keyboard Settings. This mostly works, and works perfect remoted into a Windows machine. But there is one part of this setup that still doesn't work right:\nIn certain text editors or text-fields on web-based forms, or instant messaging apps where you are type into a field (basically any time you are editing raw text) the Control-V does not work for Paste, even when the custom shortcut for it exists.\nInstead of pasting, it moves the cursor to the end of the current view. I've learned that this is one of many \"Emacs\" keybindings that are intentionally built into Macs. Emacs is a raw text editor, and these keybindings come into play when you are inside a raw text editing environment. Basically, a different shortcut is taking precedence over my custom one. This behavior can be reproduced by adding the custom shortcut and attempting to paste with it in Apple's own TextEdit.\nAfter even more research, I've discovered that these Emacs Keybindings can be unset by adding/editing a DefaultKeyBinding.dict file using such syntax as { \"^v\" = ( ); } -- which I've done and....well, it works...for some things. It seems to have fixed the issue for native OS apps such as TextEdit, but still won't paste (and it still moves the cursor to the end) in most web form fields and web-based editing programs. And it's extremely frustrating.\n\nA: This will be a massive amount of work due to how Apple designed the text handling routines all across its developer tools.\nNothing is truly impossible, but the lift here will be enormous to somehow “hot patch all of the code” everywhere. I believe you’ve done a good job isolating which easy fixes are available and now have the harder nuts to crack, application by application.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible natively. However, if you are open to using a third-party tool, I believe Keyboard Maestro is flexible enough to remap any key to any action. I'm sure other key-mapping tools can do the same.\nRegarding your comment on customizing DefaultKeyBinding.dict, here is a good summary of the OS Text System and default bindings, along with details on how to customize DefaultKeyBinding.dict. That file is essentially a mapping of keyboard shortcuts to NSResponder methods, described here, but you can see that none of the methods include anything like a \"paste from clipboard\" option.\n", "Q: What causes the \"file\" command to report a JavaScript file as \"HTML document text\"? I downloaded a JavaScript document, but it fails to load in my webpage, stating that the mimetype of \"\" is not acceptable. When I use the file(1) command on the JavaScript file, it tells me that the file is \"HTML document text\".  The file looks roughly like this:\n/*\n   some boring attribution, etc.\n*/\n$(function($) {\n     a lot of javascript, including a few lines that add HTML to the page, such as\n     _base.append('<a style=\"background-color:'+_settings._main_btn_color+'\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"_col_shadow _collapz_parant _close\"></a>');\n}(jQuery));\n\nI know the file command uses various patterns to make its determination, I'm just wondering what it is that is triggering its decision.\n\nA: To solve the root problem of the served MIME type, ensure the file extension is .js or .javascript.\nThis will help the web server correctly identify the contents and set the MIME type appropriately.\n", "Q: How to get images from a very old iPad? I have a very old iPad (maybe 10 years old or so?) on which I took numerous photos and videos of my kids when they were very young.\nThese images are irreplaceable. I want to move them to cloud storage. However, there are numerous problems I have trying to do that. I never synched that iPad with any other computer. I don't have an iTunes account (as far as I know). The device is so old that when I go to the App Store to download Google Drive or DropBox, there are no versions of those apps that are compatible with this ancient iPad.\nThe iPad runs version 9.3.5 of IOS.\nSo what should I do? I have never been much into the Apple hardware/software ecosystem. So I don't know what the best solution is. I own a MacBook Pro and multiple Chromebooks.\nNote: the iPad has a 30-pin (wide) access port on the bottom.\n\nA: Option 1: Turn on iCloud photo library.\nSettings > iCloud > Photos\nYou'll probably need a paid iCloud plan, depending on how many photos you have.\nOption 2: Plug the iPad into your MacBook Pro\nYou can get a lightning to USB-C cable for under $20, or just get a USB A to C adapter, and use the charging cable that came with the iPad. The photos will show up in the Photos application on your mac once it's plugged in.\n\nA: Also, to get an old version of an app e.g Dropbox, Drive.\nLogin with the same appleid on a more modern apple device (iphone etc) or possibly on a desktop computer.\nPurchase (for zero dollars) the apps.\nOn the ipad 2, open App Store and either look at \"Purchased Apps\" or browse to find the identical apps you already \"bought\", and download them.\nThe option to download an older version should appear.\nI also recommend you get the Chrome browser at the same time as some websites will work with it when Safari will not, and it may not be available in the future.\n", "Q: How can you set an app to be removed from the Dock when closed?

I want to update beyond High Sierra in order to be able to run latest Citrix app on this \"old\" iMac from mid-2011 (that still works very well).\n\nA: Citrix for Mac needs a minimum of Catalina 10.15.\nAs you are probably already aware, the last supported OS for that iMac is 10.13.6\nThe technical difficulty in going beyond that is predominantly the GPU in the Mac. It must support Metal2, which your iMac doesn't.\nThere is a patcher available to enable unsupported upgrades to Catalina [& even beyond, but I would highly recommend you don't try that] from dosdude.\nThis was a highly recommended, though unlicensed, structure that would allow you to upgrade unsupported Macs.

Currently I am at university, so I did not know if it was the best idea to either install the update using my phone's hotspot with data, or if I should use the university wifi (which I don't know if I necessarily trust completely).\nIf anyone could give me some insight, that would be great\n\nA: Trust could mean a few different things, but the first that come to my mind can be easily alleviated:\n\n*\n\n*Trust it to not disconnect mid-upgrade: not a problem.\nThe entire upgrade is downloaded before it starts. If the download is interrupted, it will continue from where it left off. Once downloaded, internet connectivity is no longer necessary.\n\n\n*Trust it to not be intercepted: not a problem.\nUpgrades are code signed using Apple’s signature, which Gatekeeper will verify\n\nSome software updates are automatically verified\nWhen you download and install an update from Apple, Apple's digital signature is automatically verified before installation.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT202369\nand you can still verify yourself: How can I determine if a certain .app file is signed.\nTherefore you should just use the University network as it will be faster.\n\nA: Apple has a lot of safeguards in place to make sure that internet recovery is secure. It's not publicly documented, but I'd imagine it's hard-coded to happen only over an encrypted connection that's not easily MITM'd. Additionally, if your macbook is a 2018 or later model, you're protected by Secure Boot.\nI'd go ahead and use the university wifi.\n", "Q: How to keep Macbook Pro external monitor in use when opening the lid?

However, if I open the lid (to use the camera) the external monitor goes blank and I cannot do anything because the screen is broken. Is there a way to configure things with the lid closed such that when the lid opens the external monitor is retained?\n\nA: I got it working. Initially the external monitor did not display at all when the lid the was up. Then the external monitor spontaneously started working in non-mirrored mode with the lid up but when I opened System Preferences it was on the broken screen not on the monitor.
