["Q: Smart Keyboard draining 2016 iPad Pro battery My Smart Keyboard Is draining my 2016 iPad Pro battery. Apple Support cannot help. Just opened a case number for me without solving my issue. \n\nSmart Connector is clean (without any debris or cracks or nicks) and it attaches very strong with its magnet. Has anybody experienced this problem and had it resolved, and if so, what fixed the problem?\nApple Support cannot help.

I need to back up to Google Drive on Mojave.\nFirst of all, I tried Google Drive file system but it needs cache and I can't copy all my files, because there is not enough cache space. Then I tried Mountain Duck, Expandrive, and Cloudmounter, but they have the same requirements as the Google Drive file system.(\nGoogle Drive will mount as a local disk and you need to copy files from your hard drive to Google Drive , after the copy finished it will start uploading . If the cache partition only have 70GB,you will not be able to copy a folder larger than 70GB)\nGoogle`s Backup ＆ Sync doesn't support the NTFS file system on macOS.\nI need to find software that directly backs up to Google Drive without copy and caching, where I can pause & continue, and show upload progress.\n\nA: Try Cyberduck.

Is there a way to have two copies of the same app (say one in applications folders and another on desktop) but both copies of the app have their own unique preferences file so that any changes that I make in one app are not reflected on the other. \nmy concern is essentially the apps plist file.  Thanks! \n\nA: Short answer: No.\nLonger answer: Maybe once, sorta; but now, not really, no.\nIt doesn’t matter where the apps are stored, the preference files are always stored in the same place\nThere was an app called \"SwitchUp\" (originally \"rooSwitch\") that was designed to let you easily switch between multiple sets of preferences. Its homepage says that it is no longer in active development, which I assume means that it may no longer work, and may not even be for sale anymore.\nHowever, the concept was basically this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Find \"the preferences files and related data\" (let's call this a \"profile\" for short) for an app, and, when asked, hide it away somewhere.\n\n*Allow the user to create a new profile or duplicate an existing profile.\n\n*Let the user then switch between profiles #1 and #2 (or #3, #4, etc) whenever they want.\n\n\nThe key, of course, was that you could only switch \"profiles\" (I think that's what they were called) when the app was not running. And if you launched the app and realized you had the wrong set of preferences, etc. you would have to quit the app, then launch SwitchUp, then change the profile, then launch the app again.\nIt has never been possible (as far as I am aware) to run two copies of the same app at the same time.\nI assume that one of the reasons why SwitchUp is no longer being developed is that it became more and more difficult to accomplish that task. Originally it might have just been a preference file and possibly a folder in ~/Library/Application Support/\"your app name here\"/. But now there might be iCloud data, and \"Containers\" inside the ~/Library/ folder which are not very amenable to this type of \"profile switching\".\nIs it possible that you might be able to make something like that work with some Mac application? Yes. Assuming you can identify all of the \"profile\" data, and found some way to move it aside and store it in a retrievable manner later on, you might be able to make it work to have two different sets of app data that you cannot use simultaneously.\nBut I wouldn't recommend trying it, because I think it's fraught with peril and almost inevitably bound to end in sadness.\n", "Q: Is there any way to get a log of all the recently installed files and their respective folder paths and source directories? I recently installed an open source game. The file type is .pkg . \nNow, during installation the installer asked for permission to access the system UI server. I didn't knew the reason behind it so I googled it up and before I could deny it the dialogue box asking for the permission has disappeared.\nThe installation was successful. But, I don't know where did the installer installed the game I tried every app cleaner to find the installed file but couldn't find it, it's not even in the applications folder.\nSo my question is; is there any way to get a log of all the recently installed files and their respective folder paths and source directories, so that I can find it and delete it?\n\nA: Installers that ask for your login password can put a lot of crap in your filesystem.\nYou could create a user account in the future with standard credentials, not admin, purely for games. This maintains a separation and improves security.\nBut for now let's explore a bit.\nTo see the files created after a specific date, like when you installed the game, use find from a Terminal like\nfind / -type f -newerct 2018-01-01\n\nOr whatever date you want. You can find files of a certain size, whatever, find is powerful but slow. It will, however check the entire filesystem if necessary. Replacing the slash with the tilde (~) constrains searches to your home folder. Some searches need to be run with sudo. Try man find from a Terminal.\nYou should also set up folder actions. on key folders. I do this on all of my machines via right click on\n/Library/LaunchAgents\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents\n/Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents\nTo be alerted if installers drop files there in the future. There are corresponding LaunchDaemon folders alongside them.\nWhen running a legitimate package .pkg installer you can generally do a Get Info (⌘I) to see a list of what will be installed.\n\nA: I do not know about Mojave but on High Sierra keeps good record of Installed Applications.\nGo to About this Mac > System Report \nscroll down to Software ad click on Applications\nif you found it select it and it will show you where it is\n", "Q: 200GB unused, but can't change APFS container size due to minimum requirement I want to create a partition with a different filesystem but in order to do that I need to resize my APFS container.\n\n\nThis container has 292,4 GB used space.

The monitor comes with a USB-C port that sends power as well as image. But it's unclear to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the wattage it sends?\n\n*Is that enough to charge an MBP that's in use? \n\n\nA: Your model MBP ships with an Apple 87W USB-C Power Adapter and USB-C Charge Cable. However, you don't need the full 87W in order to be able to charge the MBP. Apple's adapter is designed to provide an ideal amount of power in order to both use the MBP and charge it at a certain rate. \nYou can use lower rated power adapters, but depending on the quality and actual power output, they may not last long if used continuously for charging the MBP, or they may not be able to charge it while it's operational. Obviously, I can't cover all scenarios here.\nHowever, in terms of the U2419HC Dell UltraSharp 24 USB-C Monitor, one of the USB downstream ports does provide up to 65W of power. By way of comparison, Apple typically provides:\n\n\n*\n\n*30W adapters for their MacBooks and MacBook Airs\n\n*61W adapters for their 13\" MacBook Pros\n\n*87 W adapters for their 15\" MacBook Pros\n\n\nIn a nutshell, what this means is that you will be able to use the U2419HC Dell Monitor and also charge your MBP at the same time, but it won't charge your MBP as fast as your Apple 87W USB-C Power Adapter will.\nHow fast it will charge your MBP will also depend on its usage - if you're just doing some word processing it'll charge faster than it will if you're rendering videos or playing graphics intensive games, so that may factor into your considerations. However, for most people most of the time, this monitor will work fine as a display and charging source.\n\nSince you're interested in understanding the rate of charge and discharge of your MacBook Pro, I thought I'd recommend you download and try coconutBattery. It provides a whole heap of information that you'll find useful, and from memory includes both Discharging with and Charging with measurements in watts (obviously, only one is displayed at a time since your device can't do both simultaneously).\nAlso, I should point out that macOS also provides a great deal of information.

Now I have a MacBook Pro which uses different iCloud account.\nI want to know if I can use my earlier Apple ID on this new Mac just for Apple music?\nApple Support document, Sign in with your Apple ID appears to advice against it.\n\nA: It is quite possible to use different Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes. Even the Apple Support document, Sign in with your Apple ID - Use different Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes mentions it.\n\nUse different Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes\nWe recommend that you use the same Apple ID for all Apple services on your device—including the iTunes & App Stores and iCloud. Using multiple Apple IDs might be confusing and cause issues with accessing purchased content or using some services.\nBut if you already have different Apple IDs that you want to use with iCloud and the iTunes & App Stores, follow these steps.\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\n\n*\n\n*If you're using iOS 10.3 or later, go to Settings and tap Sign in to your [device]. Enter the Apple ID that you want to use with iCloud. Go back to Settings, scroll down, and tap iTunes & App Stores. Tap Apple ID: [your name] > Sign Out. Then sign in with the Apple ID that you want to use with iTunes.\n\n\n*If you're using iOS 10.2 or earlier, go to Settings > iCloud and sign in with the Apple ID that you want to use with iCloud. Go back to Settings > iTunes & App Stores and sign in with the Apple ID that you want to use with iTunes.\nOn your Mac, go to System Preferences > iCloud and sign in with the Apple ID that you want to use with iCloud. Go to iTunes > Account > Sign In. Enter the Apple ID that you want to use with iTunes.\nIf you use multiple Apple IDs and want to restore your device from a backup, you can learn more about iCloud or iTunes backups.\nIf you have multiple Apple IDs, you can’t merge them.\n\nSo, it is feasible to use separate to use separate Apple IDs for iTunes and iCloud. To use the desired Apple ID for Apple Music, simply launch iTunes, and in the Menu bar go to Account → Sign Out.

I have been searching the internet looking for this capability and this forum is all I have so far found.  Sadly, no answer appears to be available to activate an \"always listening\" bluetooth mic.  \nGoogle assistant apparently can do this from what I have read, but users complain that the headset/mic battery is dead in less than 2 hours.

Can this be fixed? Situation.\nThis is a Macbook laptop. No external monitors.\nI have two \"desktops.\" I have Chrome open in both desktops. And terminal.app open in just Desktop 1.\nI'm in Chrome on desktop 1. I cmd-tab to Terminal. I cmd-tab (not holding cmd, just hitting cmd-tab and releasing) and it takes me to chrome in Desktop 2.\nMy expected result is that it would take me to chrome in desktop 1 because that was the window/app that I was most recently using.\nCan this be fixed?\nThings I've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off \"Displays have separate spaces\" in mission control settings. Logged out and in, no success.\n\n\nIs there a fix?\nThanks\n\nA: As far as I can tell this is an issue that is provoked by something in Chrome. \nI'm struggling with the same issue but while having multiple displays attached (behaves the same as spaces in most ways) where if I have Chrome on Display one and two. \nIf I now cmd+tab to an app that's only on display 2 it'll switch focus to that display but when I Cmd+tab back to Chrome it will focus back to display 1 in spite of having a Chrome window also on display 2.\nIf I now switch these two windows of Chrome around the focus priority doesn't change so it doesn't have anything to do with the creation order of the windows but soley with the Desktop which they're on. \nFor my 2-Display setup it prioritizes always the same one no matter where the Dock is located or anything else I could think of to try. I therefore think it's got something to do with the internal differentiation of macOS between the displays. \nBut now for the kicker: If I try to reproduce the same illogical behaviour with Safari it doesn't happen. Safari behaves exactly as one would expect regarding focusing order. \nThus I think it's a problem created by some interaction of Chrome and macOS because of the arbitrary lock to a Display. \nI therefore think the easiest solution for your Problem is to move the Terminal Window(s) to the Desktop where Chrome focuses. Maybe reordering the Desktops might change something about the behaviour but I didn't check that. \n\nA: Looks like this workaround might help. This indeed happens with Chrome windows most of the time.\n\ncreate a new space in Mission control, drag all the Chrome windows in the \"focus-hog\" space to the new space (in Mission control, click and drag the Chrome icon up onto the new space), and then drag them back. This seems to reset the behavior for all spaces with Chrome windows.\n\n", "Q: Make pixel size numbers in Preview show larger when editing photos? I occasionally have trouble seeing the small pixel-size values that Preview.app displays while editing photos. For images that are close to 640 pixels, I like to keep them just under 640 so they display full size in Stack Exchange, like the image below does in this question.\nIs there any way I can ask Preview to just make those numbers a bit larger? Permanently is fine, or a hot key. I'd like to avoid solutions that just zoom the whole screen.\n\n\nA: It's not possible to customize the size of the said on-screen numbers shown by Preview.app.\nAs a workaround and a more generalized solution for other such cases, you can leverage the Screen Zoom feature available in macOS. Although it's an accessibility feature, it is generally employed by UI designers to create pixel perfect UI.\nTo enable and configure Screen zoom, go to System Preferences app → Accessibility → Zoom, and enable the checkmark for Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom. Now assign a convenient key to be used as modifier key (I use Control).\n\nOnce configured, you can press and hold the modifier key and scroll to quickly zoom in and out of your screen.\n", "Q: Cannot change any Bluetooth settings On my MacBook Pro 2018 I can't change any Bluetooth related settings anymore as long as no external dongle is connected.\nExamples: If I turn it off, next start it is turned on again.

I have purchased a ton of space from Apple for iCloud for the purpose of ensuring everything I need stays there. Unfortunately, it only shows me the two most recent iCloud Backups. However, I have seen screenshots from people showing multiple available iCloud Backups to restore from. What gives with that?\nBasically, Apple deleted my older backups, which I was not aware they did. When I spoke to Apple representatives, many were under the impression that Apple does not delete your Backups or stop backing up unless you are low on space (I am not low on space). So, extra confusion there when Apple representatives all aren't on the same page and hand out conflicting information.\nI was wondering if there was any possibility that my iCloud backups still exist somewhere on Apple's servers, and if it would be possible to access them? I know things would have been at some point stored on multiple Apple servers. I understand this is a long shot, and I understand that I should have been backing up my phone in multiple ways (I actually do, but lost a message during the week I need to restore from). \nDoes anyone have insight into why Apple started doing this, especially when a user has purchased additional space and there is no need to delete?\n\nA: iCloud Backup only stores the most recent backup of your device. Every time you take a new backup, the old one is automatically erased.\nThis is how it is supposed to be, and how it always has been (or at least for multiple years). It’s not something new, nor is it specific for your account. It doesn’t matter how much space you’ve bought, how much you’ve paid or how much free space you have.\nYou can have multiple iCloud backups stored on your account when you have multiple devices, or backups of older devices that you no longer have. As far as I recall, it is also possible to have multiple iCloud backups stored if you have done a major iOS update, so that you have the latest backup from before the upgrade, and the latest backup from after the upgrade.\nThere’s no user-accessible way of accessing backups that have been overwritten in this fashion. I doubt that Apple has any way to restore such backups either, as the disk blocks probably have been reused for other purposes in the mean while.\nThere's also no user-accessible way of asking iCloud Backup to keep two or more backups of the same device at different points in time.\nIf you want to have multiple point in time backups of the same device, you’ll need to use iTunes and backup on a local computer.\n", "Q: Can AppleScript search deeply for the largest file contained below a folder? I need to make an AppleScript that would find the biggest file in selected directory (even if its inside another folder) and show full path on screen. \nThis is what I have so far, but it doesn't work:\nset theItem to quoted form of POSIX path of (choose folder)\n\nset theSize to (do shell script \"/usr/bin/mdls -name kMDItemFSSize -raw \" & theItem)\n\non open f\n\nset filePath to do shell script \"dirname \" & POSIX path of f as string\n\ndisplay dialog theFilePath\n\nI'm not sure how to tell what isn't working from the script above. Can you help with the next step in making this work?\n\nA: There are various methods to accomplish this task, each with pros and cons.  The shell methods are fast-ish, but don't always return up-to-date information.  AppleScript's Finder interface is not as slow as I thought it would be, but only returns viable values for file sizes that have been cached, otherwise \"missing value\" for the rest.  System Events is normally the AppleScript file managing application of choice, as it's fast upon retrieval, but slows down when accessing file attributes.  It also can't do a deep directory enumeration like Finder can (although one can be implemented manually).\nI decided to use the Objective-C scripting bridge to write an AppleScript that is both super fast, and fully capable of descending into the subfolders of a directory.   Overall, it's the best method, but comes with the drawback that your teacher might be a bit suspicious.\n# Loads the Foundation framework into the script so that we can access its\n# methods and constants\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\n\n# Declare properties that belong to the Foundation framework for easier\n# referencing within the script\nproperty this : a reference to current application\nproperty NSArray : a reference to NSArray of this\nproperty NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsHiddenFiles : a reference to 4\nproperty NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsPackageDescendants : a reference to 2\nproperty NSFileManager : a reference to NSFileManager of this\nproperty NSSortDescriptor : a reference to NSSortDescriptor of this\nproperty NSString : a reference to NSString of this\nproperty NSURL : a reference to NSURL of this\nproperty NSURLFileSizeKey : a reference to NSURLFileSizeKey of this\nproperty NSURLNameKey : a reference to NSURLNameKey of this\nproperty NSURLPathKey : a reference to NSURLPathKey of this\n\n# Call the handler defined below.

What I'm looking to do is create a shortcut to call into a work conference line that has a fairly complex set of key presses and voice input needed to connect.

But I can’t seem to pause that step until the previous steps are complete.  Since I can’t anticipate how long it will take for the call to initially connect, I can’t simply pause that step for a fixed number of seconds. \nThe other thing I can’t figure out is how to automate the final # keypress (in the shortcuts command chain) after the voice input where the call is already connected. \nAny help is appreciated... Thanks.\n\nA: FYI, I ran this and discovered that unless you turn on the speaker phone, the spoken audio will come through the phone headset.\nYou could try doing this as a shortcut.\nStep 1, you would have to have the phone dial the sequence that you have listed with the pauses.  That would have to be a pre-set contact.\nStep 2, you have to set a Wait. You'd have to set the seconds that you need to wait for the call to go through, step through the dial in prompts, before this next step.\nStep 3, turn up your volume to 100%\nStep 4 would be to speak your name. You enter in your name and you can choose the voice you want to speak it.

I want to prepend to each of them the name of the file (and its creation date) and then glue them all together in a unique rtf file, respecting chronological order. \nHow can I do that? For the moment I have created the following script: for every rtf file in the folder, it creates a new file (.txt... it is so difficult to use rtf with bash!) and writes into it the name and the creation date of the original file. \nfor f in *.rtf; do \ntouch $f\"_info_file.txt\"\necho \"File name:\" $f >> $f\"_info_file.txt\";\nprintf \"Date: \" >> $f\"_info_file.txt\";\nstat -f \"%SB\" \"$f\" >>$f\"_info_file.txt\";\ndone\n\n(I guess this is very rough...)\nNow I would like to glue them together in chronological order but I am a bit lost... Any ideas? Can Automator be useful? Thanks. \n\nA: Following mod's suggestion, I post here my solution to the problem. \nI created the following script for bash: \nfor f in *.rtf; do\n   olddate=$(stat -f %SB -t %Y%m%d%H%M \"$f\")\n   touch -mt $olddate \"$f\"\"_info_file.txt\"\n  echo \"File name:\" \"$f\" >> \"$f\"\"_info_file.txt\";\n  printf \"Date: \" >> \"$f\"\"_info_file.txt\";\n  stat -f \"%SB\" \"$f\" >>\"$f\"\"_info_file.txt\";\ndone\n\nI ran it into the bash and for each RTF file I had in folder a new .txt file associated to it was created. This txt file contained useful metadata (to me) of the file itself. Notice that, thanks to the script above, the new txt files were created in such a way that their creation date coincided with the files they are referring to. \nExample: I had file01.rtf in the folder. After the script ran, in the folder I could find a file named file01_info_file.txt whose content was \nName file: file01.rtf \nDate: 20.12.2018 18.53 \n\nThe creation date of the file file01_info_file.txt is identical to the creation date of file01.rtf. \nNow the conclusion easily follows: open Finder, sort by creation date the files in the folder, select them all and drag them in a new ... ... Microsoft Word document (:-D). The formatting of rtf was kept and the chronological order as well. \n", "Q: Is https://bugreport.apple.com/web/ restricted to developers?

Do I do\ncd ~/Downloads\n./echoHelloWorld\n\nbecause I have tried that, but it does not work, and I have also tried chmod +x echoHelloWorld.sh with no results. \n\nA: If you have added the path of the file to run to your PATH variable you can run your command directly with\n echoHelloWorld.sh\n\nindependent of the directory you are in. Running it as ./echoHelloWorld.sh actually explicitly tells the shell to ignore PATH and run the script from the current directory (where it is not available).\n\nA: TL;DR\nYour path statement in ~/.bash_profile should look like this:\nPATH=$PATH:~/git/scripts/\n\nThe basics.....\nThere are three problems with the way you wrote it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shouldn't use the export function since the variable (PATH) is already in the environment.  When you logged in, the PATH variable was created and set.  You don't need to export it as it already exists.\n\n*Remove the double quotes.  Double quotes cause the path to be read literally so the ~ home directory expansion never takes place.  For tilde expansion to work, it can't be enclosed in quotes.  If you want to verify this, at the command line type the following:\n$ PATH=\"~/git/scripts:$PATH\"\n$ echo $PATH\n~/git/scripts:/opt/local/bin:...                  <====== INCORRECT RESULT\n\n$ PATH=~/git/scripts:$PATH\n$ echo $PATH\n /Users/foouser/git/scripts:/opt/local/bin:.....  <====== CORRECT!\n\n\n*Your tilde expanded (personal home directory) paths should be at the end of your path statement.  Your path is read from left to right, taking precedence as it goes.  In other words, if there is a command/function in your home directory with the same name as something already in your PATH it will be executed (found) first and may have unintended consequences.\nOnce you make the change to your ~/.bash_profile you can restart your session or just source it as you did before and the changes will take place.  You can confirm that it worked by issing either (or both) the following commands:\n$ echo $PATH\n$ which echoHelloWorld.sh\n\nThe first will output the PATH as set and the second will tell you where in the path it found your script.\n\nA: *\n\n*You need to make your command executable. \nchmod +x echoHelloWorld.sh \n# verify it worked.\nls -l echoHelloWorld.sh \n\n\n*edit your profile, which most often is ~/.bash_profile Add the directory to your path variable. \n# some people recommend putting your scripts at the end of path. \n# Less risk of you accidentally overriding a system file name.\nPATH=\"$PATH:${HOME}/git/scripts/\"\n\n\n*I'd quit the session.

Thank you for your help and if there is any more information that I should provide to facilitate this diagnostics, please feel free to say so. \n\nA: In a nutshell, yes.\nYour MacBook Pro battery has a life expectancy at or around 1000 cycles.  It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; it's just an estimation of how long it can last.   You can refer to Determine battery cycle count for Mac notebooks on Apple's website for more info.\nIt seems you've had a good run overall and extracted most, if not all of the value out of it.

There are many 3rd party battery options available for purchase, so if you're still happy with your MBP then that's your best option. If not, then it's time to upgrade.\nIf you do decide to replace the battery, then I would ensure that you purchase a battery from a reputable online store dealing with Apple products.\nFor example, the following are some well-regarded sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Sales \n\n*Simply Mac\n\n*RAM City\n\n*Macfixit\nBy buying from a reputable store you'll be sure to get a battery fit for purpose, regardless of manufacturer. Being reputable means they're only going to sell something that works and they'll stand behind the product they sell, regardless of the brand.\n\nA: I think your battery is breaking records in life time.\nPretty sure the charger light is not showing, because your battery is total loss.\nWhen a battery gets to old, it can not retain any charge (be charged) any more.\nSo your Magsafe will not show charging light.\nIt just needs to be replaced, and you can do it yourself, just make sure you buy the right one for your model.\nInstructions how to replace battery \n", "Q: Outlook signature corrupted My Outlook for Mac signature has been displaying fine up until about 3 days ago.

I also managed to find another mac and download a genuine High Sierra and make a bootable out of it, but when I went to install it, same error - Permission Denied.\nMany more hours of research, and I found out by typing the command (lsof|grep 'Volumes/Macintosh HD') that there were two processes running - 169 and 197 (see image below) . Killed them both.\n\nAnd then was able to force unmount the disk via terminal (diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk0). However when I went to erase by trying the command (diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Mac /dev/disk0), it threw the error - 69825: Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed. (image below).\n\nAfter which I ran the following command (gpt -v destrory /dev/disk0) with the intention it might clear off the partitioning, I guess I was wrong because now I do not have a Macintosh HD in Disk Utility, and the internal Disk says 'Uninitialized' (image below)\n\nSo yeah, that's where I am after 5 days of troubleshooting - pretty much nowhere! I am not a mac genius, but I know things. But this is getting too complicated now. The other weird thing I found is when I type the command (diskutil list), I get this long list going upto /dev/disk21 and all of them are disk images. (see below). Not sure if that has anything to do with it.\n\nSo assuming the next step would be to initialize the disk, ran the following commands.\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Mac disk0\ndiskutil partitiondisk disk0 JHFS+ Mac 100%\ngives me the same error (image below)\n\nSo, not really sure where to go from here. I think my brain's reached the saturation level unless someone can point out something that I haven't tried that might help. Any suggestions are welcome.\nLastly, this could very well be a hardware fault which I might have caused due to my troubleshooting step - I'd never know i guess. But this is an old machine, and I'm willing to get my hands dirty here to find a way out.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: I managed to connect my HDD as an external on another mac, and was actually able to format it clean without errors. I mounted it back and began the installation, only to give me an error at the end which I don't exactly remember what it was, had lot of numbers in it - at this point I had kinda given up. So, Its either a faulty hard-disk or a faulty SATA cable, either way there's no point in trying to fix it - not worth the time. It is definitely not a software problem. Will be going for a new SSD by the looks of it.\nI hope this thread can prove helpful to anyone having similar issues. Thanks for the help guys.\nSolved.\n", "Q: External 4K display with 2012 MacBook Pro 15\" I have a MacBook Pro Retina mid 2012 and have bought a couple of BenQ 4K EL2870U monitors. I've connected the two monitors up to the MacBook through a couple of Mini Display Port to Display Port cables that support 4K resolution, but I'm unable to get the monitors to display anything above 1280 x 720 resolution.  \n\nNote that the number of pixels pushed from my MacBook Pro is actually 2560 x 1440 since the chosen resolution is not \"low resolution\". However, I would rather have 2560 x 1440 \"low resolution\" than the current 1280 x 720 \"high resolution\" I currently have, since that gives me less screen real estate than I had on my previous non-4K monitors. If I choose any other resolution (\"low resolution\" or not), the BenQ just goes blank.\n\nI should at least get it to display all low-resolution modes up to 2560 x 1440, isn't that right? In this related question it seems like even the 3840 x 2160 resolution should be available at 30Hz, but alas it doesn't work for me. Ideas?\n\nA: By installing SwitchResX I was able to choose 2560 x 1440 (60 Hz) which now gives me the screen real estate I need.\n\nA really neat choice that doesn't give me as much screen real estate, but makes the screen into a retina 1080p monitor is the 1080p30 option. Everything now looks super crisp and I have the same screen real estate as on a full HD monitor.\n\nA bit annoying that I need a $16,- third party application to fix this problem, but it's better than no solution at all.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 and iPhone X: Mail app not showing attachments correctly I have been encountering issues with both an iPhone 6 and an iPhone X using Apple Mail app. When receiving multiple automated reports from SRSS, the attachments will clone from other, similar reports.\nOn other phones, this behavior does not seem to happen, as it does not seem to happen on PCs. This lead me to believe it being an issue with iOS/Mail app. The reports are sent in HTML Web archive format through e-mail.\nI have researched on the Internet regarding this issue, and mostly I found people reporting this issue, but I haven't found many solutions.\nI would like to know what could be done about this. If possible, I would rather not install a secondary application for work e-mails on these phones but if this is the only option then I'd do it.\n\nA: As the Internet search has yielded that the problem is also being faced by others, but hasn't yielded any solution, it's most likely a bug with the stock Mail app.\nA likely resolution would be to use the official email client app from the email service provider (Outlook in this case). Official app is more likely to work bug free compared to Apple's Mail app.\nThe stock Mail app can be easily uninstalled on devices running iOS 10 and later as outline in this Apple Support document:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove built-in Apple apps from the Home screen on your iOS 10 device or Apple Watch.\n\n", "Q: Running an app off an external hard drive Can I download DaVinci Resolve to an external hard drive and work from/off it?\nMy computer has a limited storage space, so I can not download it straight to my computer. Ideally, i'd like to download it to my external hard drive and work off it. Can this be done?\n\nA: Running is not a problem, but the program might (and, like many others, will) put several folders to ~/Library (hidden) folder - Logs, Cache, Container/Group Container.

It can take up to 7 days to prepare the report and you will have up to 14 days once it's ready to download it before it's deleted.\nYou will need to login with your Apple ID, password and two-factor authentication token.  You will be able to select what data you wish to download.\nSelect Data to be downloaded...\n\nYou will then receive an email from Apple confirming the request...\n\nWhen you Receive your report.\nMy report came in 4 days after the request. It was an email message that takes you to a secure Apple website (you must authenticate) and will allow you to download your report.\nThere were 3 files in mine.  The Apple ID & Account Information.csv is the file of interest.\n\nAfter opening it in your application of choice (Excel or Pages is probably best), you will find a \"Created Date\" for your Apple ID in chronological order.  So, looking at mine, my ID was created 5/13/2009 (not the actual date, I changed it for this answer).  It includes the time as well; select the cell to see the time stamp.\n\nWhy so many entries?  Everytime you update something, your address, your credit card info, your sharing, etc. it creates an entry.  So, you may see many entries for the same Apple ID.\nThis report will provide you with every bit of information with respect to your Apple ID account info from creation to the last update.  A lot of columns were hidden for privacy, but I encourage you to explore the report(s) to see what data is collected.\n\nA: An indirect way is to search your email archive for messages from appleid@id.apple.com asking for verification of the email address you gave when creating the id.\n\nA: There is no way of knowing the exact data when the Apple ID was created:\n\nAs far as I know you can't. You can log into your account via the\n  Store > View Account menu option and see what the earliest purchase\n  that shows on the account is, that should give you a rough idea of the\n  date, but I don't that there is anywhere that you can see the actual\n  date.\n\nReference: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6825980\nIf you are looking for an official answer this discussion is better:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7550913\nApple recommended this answer:\n\nI don't think there is a way to find that out.

For example, in order to run the same command on multiple machine, or save multiple session (so that it would be easy re-connect to those sessions simultaneously in the future). \nIs it possible to achieve this goal from the macOS machine? Are there any relevant applications for this? \n\nA: Yes, it is possible - there are a number of ways to do this. \nYou can install the program \"csshx\" from HomeBrew which is specifically designed for this purpose. First you'll need to have HomeBrew installed, and then run this command to install csshx:\nbrew install csshx\n\nThen you can run csshx like this:\ncsshX server1 server2 server3\n\nwhere serverX should be replaced with the actual hostnames of your servers.\nThat will display three graphical macOS windows with the output from each of the servers, and a fourth window with a red background, where you enter your commands. These commands are then sent to all three servers.\nA different approach is to use \"tmux\". It is a common application for Terminal usage that have many advantages, and one of them is that it allows parallel execution. In general it allows for having multiple shell sessions within one Terminal tab - for example you can have three shells with connections to different servers each in their own pane, but all in the same macOS window/tab.\nAgain you'll need to have HomeBrew installed, and then run this command to install:\nbrew install tmux\n\nYou can then run tmux to start the program. Open a pane for each you want to connect to, and ssh into them as you would normally do. When you're ready to execute commands on all servers at once, press Ctrl-B and then:\n:setw synchronize-panes\n\nNow everything you write will be written to all the panes.\nYou need to press Ctrl-B and run:\n:setw synchronize-panes off\n\nto disable the feature again.\n\nA: C3 Tools is my top pick\n  https://www.csm.ornl.gov/torc/C3/\nPSSH is another tool\nConsider if you’re running regular recipes (or: update packages on all systems) to use something like Ansible instead to manage your cluster.

One such action I have is \"Save to Dropbox\", but this is only available until I select more than one photo.\n\nBeyond that, I can click \"Save to Files\" and one of the options is \"Dropbox\"; however, it's grayed out/disabled -- regardless of whether one photo or multiple photos are selected before clicking \"Save to Files\".\n\nSo how do I save multiple files from the camera roll to Dropbox?  Why would it not be possible using the standard method?\nNote: I know that I can go to the Dropbox app and select multiple files to upload from the camera roll.  This question is specifically about doing this procedure from the camera roll.\n\nA: This has always annoyed me, that Dropbox does not allow you to save to your Dropbox from within the photos.app. Grr...\nAnd from time to time I (re-)discover how Dropbox wants you do do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dropbox\n\n*Tap the \"+\" button labelled \"Create\"\n\n*Tap \"Upload Photos\"\n\n\n...and you will be presented with your camera roll, and if you scroll up, the rest of the pictures on your iPhone. You can now select as many as you want.\nI've often hated on the way Dropbox does this as it is intuitively backwards but if you can do better than me and remember this \"trick\" you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Is it time for a new battery? I have an iPhone SE, for just over a year. My battery health which I find in settings is decreasing quite rapidly. \nRight now it is at 94%:\n\nRecently it has been going down around 1% a month. \nAfter December 31st, the battery replacement will be more expensive. When should a battery be replaced and do you think it is time to replace mine? Are my vlaues normal?\n\nA: No, you do not need and should not get a new battery. 94% after a year is pretty good. Apple’s recommendation is a replacement if the battery gets below 80% of maximum capacity. The cost increase after the 31st isn’t so much that it’s worth replacing so early.\nFor context, my iPhone 6s, which I received the day it was released, is at 75% maximum capacity after pretty heavy usage for over 3 years, so you don’t have anything to worry about for a while. (I’m hopefully going to get the battery before the end of the year.)\n\nA: You don't have to replace the battery  for at least 3 years. Even after solid usage. iOS 12 is really good on the battery. Don't let the battery hit 20% or less all the time before you push some juice into it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple products have really long life which is good as it lasts years.\n\n*If you need a second opinion, visit an Apple store, just hear what they say but listen to yourself before you decide and this is only after you hit 80% of max capacity.\nReplace it only when you think that your phone is pushing too hard for normal tasks and you run out of battery before evening or so.\n", "Q: Do I need DisplayLink software on my Mac? I just upgraded to Mojave and my second monitor would not work. Tried all kinds of things suggested in the top Google results to no avail. Then I read to try and update DisplayLink, which I had not heard of.\nI downloaded and installed it but got a security error saying I had to allow it. I thought this can't be a necessary piece of software, since it's not even by Apple. I ran the uninstaller, rebooted, and my second screen worked instantly, even remembering that the application bar should be attached to that screen.\nWhy was DisplayLink installed to begin with? Why should I need it? My second monitor work fine with just native macOS Mojave. So what benefit am I missing if any? \n\nA: DisplayLink is most commonly used to connect external displays via USB. It is proprietary software, not made or supported or automatically installed by Apple.\nIf you had it installed earlier, it was because you have installed it yourself at some point in time.\nOrdinary monitors connected via HDMI, DisplayPort, mini-DisplayPort, DVI or similar on Macs work with multiple monitor support without any extra software.\n", "Q: When does iCloud suggest a file can be stored cloud-only? Can I force iCloud to not keep the downloaded copy of a file? My intention is to store movies. First I tried adding them to iTunes but if I'm not mistaken, those movies will never be cloud-only unless they were bought through iTunes itself.\nMy next approach is to store them in iCloud. I know from other files on my computer that they are only a \"proxy\" for the actual file and that the actual file will be downloaded when needed.\nHowever since the files I'm moving around are movies, they're quite storage-intensive, and I'd love if I could tell iCloud \"please just upload them and don't mind the local copy\", but I can only choose to force-download them, and not force-delete-the-local-copy, as far as I can tell.\nIs there a way to make this happen more readily?\nI'm using Mojave 10.14.2 (18C54).\n\nA: macOS and iOS make the decision for you. The OSes use a combination of factors such as file size, how recently used files are, and quantity of free space on your device's storage in order to determine which files become cloud-only. Here's the description from Apple's support page on the topic:\n\nIf you need more space on your device, iCloud Drive can help. On your Mac, go to Apple menu → System Preferences → iCloud. Next to iCloud Drive, click Options and turn on Optimize Mac Storage. Then your Mac keeps all of your recent files on your computer, but keeps your older ones only in iCloud, ready for you to download when you need them again. If you want to free up more space on your Mac, follow these steps. On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you can search and browse files from all of your devices and download them only as you need them.\n\nThere's no way to explicitly tell iCloud Drive which files should have local copies and which should be cloud-only.\n:: Update 2020.12.09 ::\nI've run across an app named Bailiff that purports to provide the requested functionality: it can evict specific iCloud files from local storage and make them become cloud-only. More info is available at the developer's website:\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/cirrus-bailiff/\n(Note: I have no relationship with Eclectic Light Co., the developer of Bailiff. Nor do I have direct experience with this product.)\n\nA: In BigSur, it sees to have added a feature for the manual removal.\nGo to the file and right or option click on the file or folder you want to store in the cloud. Then select \"Remove Download\". This flags it to store in the cloud.\nHowever, it sees to not immediately delete the data, I'm assuming its just a flag and at some cycle the OS still decided what to remove but possibly prioritizes these.\nThe cloud icon to download the item(s) does appear, indicating that its cloud only.\nIf someone has more info on how this work, please comment.\n", "Q: \"Could not sign in to iMessage\" Could not sign in to iMessage\nAn error occurred during activation.

I have tried the ~/Library/LaunchAgents/environment.plist method and I have tried to move the same file to /Library/LaunchDaemons (and restarted) but it does not affect Emacs when it is launched from the dock, Spotlight, or the Applications window.\nIn that file, I did launchctl setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/bin  Curiously, when Terminal (bash) is launched and echo $PATH > /tmp/bash.debug is the first line in ~/.bash_profile, the output is /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin so... something has prepended /usr/local/bin while I was attempting to append it.\nI have not tried things like /etc/launchd.conf or ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist because the pages I find say that both of those stopped working a while back.\nIn particular, I want to add /usr/local/bin to PATH.  Currently, my work around is to do it in my Emacs start up files.\nThere was one person who mentioned that setting system wide environment variables in MacOS is a bad idea and I'm tempted to go along with that.

Once I get curious about something its hard for me to let it go.\nAs always, thank you very much for your time.\n\nA: The answer to this one in Mojave is to create a named file in /etc/paths.d, for instance\nvi /etc/paths.d/local_bin\n\nPut\n/usr/local/bin\n\nin the file, save and quit.

Some of these are also troubleshooting steps to help get to the bottom of the problem (although I should state at the beginning this is quote common when you have two or more versions of Numbers installed on the same device).\nSome things to try (if you haven't already):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac, wait about 10 minutes, reboot.\n\n*Check your Login Items to ensure you haven't got a Numbers document in the list. If so, remove it. (Go to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items).\n\n*Disconnect your Mac from all networks (including the Internet), quit Numbers, and try again.\n\n*Boot your Mac into Safe Mode and try using Numbers. Then boot up normally and try again.\n\n*Have Numbers 2.2 open first before trying to open Numbers files (and ensure Numbers 4.3.1 isn't running)\n\n*Select a Numbers document in Finder and use the Get Info (commandI) option to see if you can select Numbers 2.2 from the Open with drop-down list. If you can, click on the Change All... button\n\n\nIf none of the above work, even temporarily, then you may have to just totally remove Numbers 4.3.1.

That company promises in tons of online ads that its app and browser extension can help you identify “errors that other spelling and grammar checkers just can’t catch.”. \n“...First Do No Harm” would be a better founding principle.

When I turned it back on it was in \"macOS Recovery\" mode. How do I get it back to normal and keep all my files and everything?\n\nA: There are a few things you can try.\n1. Use the SDM to try booting from your usual Startup Disk\nUse Startup Disk Manager to see if your usual startup disk is available. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Switch it on and immediately press and hold the option key\n\n*Release the key when your bootable disks start appearing\n\n*If you see your usual startup disk, try booting from it\n\n\n2.

I can raise it again with the headphone volume controls, but it will be reset again when advancing to the next track.\nIs there a way to prevent this from happening?\n\nA: This appears to have been caused by the Volume Limit setting of the Music app.\nIt seems that adjusting the volume via Bluetooth will bypass the volume limit, and allow higher volumes. However, the app will reapply the limit without warning whenever it switches tracks, resulting in the observed volume reset.\nThe workaround is to turn off the Volume Limit setting.\n", "Q: macOS: Disable promiscuous Wi-Fi scan and/or display of unwanted list of Wi-Fi networks?

They take their cue from your own system date & time settings, so even if I got a script to work properly on my system utilising a specific date & time format, it would probably not work on your system unless you happened to have the same macOS settings.\nTherefore, the best way to deal with AppleScript date objects is to create them from scratch using day, month, year and time components.  That way, they work consistently across all systems, but, most importantly, allow you to manipulate them in your own script without unexpected errors.\nAdd the following handler to the bottom of your script.  It will give you the means to create an AppleScript date object by supplying to it the day, month and year, and (optionally) the hour, minute and second components:\nto makeASDate given year:y as integer ¬\n    , month:m ¬\n    , day:d as integer ¬\n    , hours:h as integer : 0 ¬\n    , minutes:min as integer : 0 ¬\n    , seconds:s as integer : 0\n    local y, m, d, h, min, s\n\n    tell the (current date) to set ¬\n        [ASDate, year, its month, day, time] to ¬\n        [it, y, m, d, h * hours + min * minutes + s]\n\n    ASDate\nend makeASDate\n\nTo use it, simply call the handler like so:\nmakeASDate given year:2018, month:January, day:23\n    --> date \"Tuesday, 23 January 2018 at 00:00:00\"\n\nor\nmakeASDate given year:2018, month:1, day:23, hours:14, minutes:30, seconds:00\n    --> date \"Tuesday, 23 January 2018 at 14:30:00\"\n\nNow, your next task is to extract the year, month a day components from your variables in order to pass them to the makeASDate handler.  The easiest way to do this is by splitting your date/time variables into words.  For example, with your start date and time:\nset [sy, sm, sd] to words of (sDate of theResult)\n    --> {\"2018\", \"12\", \"12\"}\n\nset [sh, smin, AMPM] to words of (sTime of theResult)\n    --> {\"10\", \"00\", \"AM\"}\nif AMPM = \"PM\" then set sh to sh + 12\n\nand similarly with your end times.  I've illustrated a quick test with your time variable to determine whether or not it is AM or PM, and changed the value of the hour component accordingly (the makeASDate handler uses the 24-hour clock).  You'll have to do another test with your date variable to determine what format the date is in: dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd, which might be as easy as:\nif (sDate of theResult) contains \"-\" then\n    set [sy, sm, sd] to words of (sDate of theResult)\nelse if (sDate of theResult) contains \"/\" then\n    set [sd, sm, sy] to words of (sDate of theResult)\nend if\n\n\nA: What @CJK said -- trying to cook up a date string is a losing battle because it depends on user settings, use the components instead -- except that their handler does not always work.  If you run it on a day numbered more than the number of days in the month of the input, the result will be the month after the one you asked for.  For example, if you ask for \"month:2 day:15\" on January 31, you'll get March 15, not February 15.  There are three factors involved, none of which seem to be explicitly documented:\n\n*\n\n*AppleScript date objects are stored as an absolute point in time, not a set of components.  (Well, mostly absolute: for historical reasons, they're relative to the current time zone.)  Components are synthesized on demand from that point in time using the current calendar.\n\n\n*Setting a component, such as set month of d to April, means it decomposes the date into components, changes the one component, and then composes them back into a point in time.  What happens if one of the components is out of range is not specified, but in practice, an out-of-range day will wrap to some following month.  Consider, continuing the example, set day of d to 41.  April 41st is, logically, 11 days after the last day of April, April 30, so you get May 11.\n\n\n*Even when using pattern-set syntax set {x, y} to {1, 2}, the assignments happen one at a time.  (The documentation https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/reference/ASLR_cmds.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH216-SW52 describes them as \"simultaneous\", since set {x, y} to {y, x} does in fact exchange x and y, but that isn't quite right: what really happens is that it evaluates all the expressions first, storing the results in implicit temporaries, then assigns the temporaries to the variables one at a time.  All the evaluations happen before all the assignments, but the order is otherwise unspecified.)\nSo, say you run this on January 31, 2020:\nmakeASDate given year:2018, month:2, day:15\n\nWhat happens is:\n\n*\n\n*set ASDate to (current date).  ASDate is January 31, 2020 at whatever the current time is.\n\n*set year of ASDate to 2018.  ASDate is now January 31, 2018.\n\n*set month of ASDate to 2.  The components specify February 31, 2018, which doesn't exist, so it wraps: d is now March 3, 2018.\n\n*set day of ASDate to 15.  d is now March 15, 2018, not February 15 like you asked for.\n\nThere are two ways around this: one is to first set the day and month in that order to 1 first, then apply the input parameters.  The other is to use a fixed date with low-numbered month and day, say \"1/1/1904\", instead of current date as the starting point.

How do I merge the free space with disk0s2?\nMacBook-Pro:~ mac$ sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0  \nStarted APFS operation  \nError: -69519: The target disk is too small for this operation, or a gap is required in your partition\nmap which is missing or too small, which is often caused by an attempt to grow a partition beyond the\nbeginning of another partition or beyond the end of partition map usable space  \n\nI have ran the following steps (disk0s4 is not seen in the image as its deleted and is now free space)\nStep 1: Delete the container\nsudo diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s4\n\nStep 2: Erase the volume\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" %noformat% /dev/disk0s4\n\nStep 3: Resize the container\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\n\nA: You need to know the partitioning of the drive. In particular, were the free space is. The diskutil list disk0 command shows the partitions in ascending order and the size of each partition. However, this command does not show free space. The Disk Utility application does occasionally show free space but the value is often incorrect and does not show where the free space is with respect to the other partitions\nSo where is the free space shown? Here are a few ways to determine where the free space is.\n\n\n*\n\n*The sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command will show the logical sector blocks used by each partition. The command will also show the free space between each partition in logical sector block units. In the days of OS X, you could run this command on the boot drives. Starting with macOS, System Integrity Protection (SIP) has to be disabled to do this.\n\n*Use the diskutil info -plist disk0s# command to retrieve partition number # start and size byte values. You need to repeat the command for each partition on a drive. Next, you can compile a table similar to the output from the gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command. Basically, free space is any space not allocated to a partition, the Protected Master Boot Record (PMBR) and the GUID Partition Tables (GPT).\n\n*Write a BASH script that would automate way number 2.  A free script can be downloaded from this site. Assuming your downloads goto to the default Downloads folder, you can get the free space by entering the command shown below. Note: You do not need to enter sudo or disable SIP. \n~/Downloads/driveinfo-1.0.1/driveinfo -r disk0\n\n\nIn order to add free space to a APFS container partition, the free space must reside directly below the partition.\n\nWhen you deleted disk0s4, you created free space directly after disk0s3. Since disk0s3 is between disk0s2 and this free space, you can not recover the free space by using the command given in your Step 3. You could recover the free space into disk0s3 by entering the command given below.\nsudo diskutil resizeVolume disk0s3 R \n\n", "Q: Open file/folder in Wine explorer in Finder I am using wine explorer via macOS terminal.\nOnce the Wine Explorer is open, can I select a file or folder and \"open\" it in Finder?\n\n\nA: From the Mac Forums\n\nIn Finder, push Shift-Command-G and enter the following:\n~/.wine/drive_c/\n\nNavigate from there to find the name of the relevant folder.\n\n\nA: There's no way to \"click\" on a folder in Wine and have it open in Finder because, technically, you're in a Windows environment.\nHowever, with a little info from the official Wine documentation we can make some tweaks to Finder to easily get access to the drive.\nAll of Wine's user configuration files are in a hidden directory in the user's home: ~/.wine.  The C: (\"C\" drive) can be found  in ~/.wine/drive_c.  \nUsing a simple Terminal command, we can create a symbolic link to C: on the Desktop:\n$ ln -s ~/.wine/drive_c ~/Desktop/C_Drive\n\nOr... the home folder (it won't clutter your Desktop this way)\n$ ln -s ~/.wine/drive_c ~/C_Drive\n\nOnce you have that (symlinked) folder created, you can add it to your favorites on the Finder sidebar.\nKeep in mind, you're not limited to just the root of the C: or just a directory:\n$ ln -s ~/.wine/drive_c/foo/bar/folder ~/Desktop/Foo_Bar_Folder\n\n$ ln -s ~/.wine/drive_c/foo/bar/file.txt ~/Desktop/Foo_Bar_Notepad_Document.txt\n\nThe advantage of using this method is that you can get \"easy\" access from both the Finder GUI and from Terminal.

I have about 20 batteries I want to test. I'm trying to find out if they will read \"replace\" or \"service\" in the OS. Usually, I'll stick the battery in long enough to collect a cycle count and condition. However, it seems that a lot of the batteries shortly after show \"service\" or \"replace\". Maybe,  once booted for the first time in a while, the computer assigns a new battery condition to the battery. If so, I should install the battery turn on and then restart a second time before collecting the battery info. I'm curious if maybe it takes macOS a while to assess the condition of a battery and, if so, how long it takes. What do you recommend for quickly assessing the condition of a battery? Thanks.\n\nA: Battery SOC is always time dependent.\n\nDetermining the state of charge (SOC) in lithium-ion batteries is\n  essential yet challenging due to the great variability in capacity not\n  only across different cells, but also in the same cell. As a Li-ion\n  cell ages, it loses its ability to store charge. Consequently, even if\n  fully charged, an older cell would deliver usable voltage for a\n  shorter period of time than a newer cell.\n\nWhile in the first moments it might look OK, soon after it shows the true State of Charge.\nThat is because it measures Voltage and Current variations over time to determine the SOC.\nI recommend at least 10 minutes of testing of allowing the Mac to collect the information.\nThe State of Cycle count is only a indicator for us humans, but not accurate to determine the true state.\nProbably the best indicator is the   \n\nFull Charge Capacity (mAh):   6705 \n\nFound in About this Mac > System Report > Power\nIt basically says how much charge the battery can hold.\nIt is not a linear scale thus when it reaches half a way of new battery (4000) Mac will say service the Battery.\nNew battery has values of >8000. \n\nWhat is the most accurate method of testing batteries for A1278\n  MacBook Pro?\n\nit is TIME allowing it to collect the information time related.\n", "Q: Tips or Tricks: Identifying if there are Opened Documents New Mac user here, trying to figure out how to adapt my workflow and the like from Windows/Linux to Mac.\nI think the answer might be \"it's not possible\" but here goes anyway.\nI'm used to leaving documents open as a reminder to complete them later. This means I'm used to quickly glancing at the taskbar (dock) to determine which documents I have open and what I need to do. Since the red x doesn't actually close a lot of apps - terminal for instance - it makes it a little tedious to determine if I have an open document.\nThe only solutions I can think of are either remembering to manually ⌘Q-ing each window (oof), or to right click each open app to determine if there are opened documents and then remembering the answer. Neither of those are great so I'm wondering if anyone has any good methods around this.\nI realize this might encourage discussion/opinions, but I'd like to emphasize that I am looking for concrete answers EG: \"there isn't a way\" or \"This setting will make the number of opened documents be displayed on the dock\". One of the biggest issues I'm having with moving to Mac is determining the best way to solve a problem, and I'm guessing that what I think is a solution here might not actually work.\n\nA: Just by looking the taskbar I think you can't. But you can set an easy shortcut and if you click on the application you want to view and the press the shortcut you can see all the windows opened (active and minimised) for that application. \nIn System Preference > Mission Control, you can set a shortcut for Application windows. Just try it once and with time it will become smooth for you.\n\nA: this are my settings where a black dot are shown in the outer edge of the dock to mark open applications. and all the minimised apps are stored as an icon in the dock itself.\nI assumed you used document to say app.\nif it is about one application, multiple windows, open documents can be seen in window menu on the top. OR by sliding down three fingers(app expose; set the gesture in touchpad gestures.) to see if such window is present on other document.\nhowever only #2,#5,#6 are relevant.\n\nalso,  feel free to ask more such tips as that's what I like to explore on my Mac.\n\nA: You can click on the yellow ball upper left of the window, the minimize icon, to minimize the window to the dock. \n\nThe minimized windows appear in the right side of the dock.\n\nThe right white sheets are the minimized windows.\nThe macOS dock paradigm is a little different than windows. The mini-small black triangle below the app icon indicates that the app is running. You can see that I have terminal, system report and acrobat reader running.  I have my dock icons to expand when the mouse pointer is over an icon.  I have a minimized folder and three application windows minimized. \nThis would seem about the same as windows, I think.  \nRobert\n", "Q: Are iMessage encryption keys sent to all listed devices even if they're broken?

I also did not find any obvious select tool on the toolbar.\n\nA: *\n\n*Use the keyboard shortcut Command + I to show the Inspector. It will list all the shapes added in the current editing session.\n\n*Click on the desired shape in the Inspector. This will also select the shape.\n\n\n\n*Now use the arrow  keys to move the selected shape, Up ↑, Down ↓, Left ← or Right →.\n\n*Press and hold Shift key along with the arrow key to move the shape with faster speed.\n\n*Alternatively, once the shape is selected (either by clicking on it or via Inspector), you can also hover the mouse pointer over it until the cursor turns into a white glove. Thereafter, you can click and drag to move the shape freely.\n\n\nA: Here is what I do with shapes in Preview.\nI recommend not to select the shape it self.\nClick anywhere next to it to deselect (not required but safer), that way you will not accidentally reshape it. \nLike in your case the shape is small and the reshaping dots are large, so it becomes tricky to select the shape for moving.\n\nNow go back and \"hover\" over the shape till a hand shows instead arrow cursor.\n\nClick and HOLD (hand animates that) and move it while holding.\n\nA: When I have this issue, or similar ones with Preview, always remember to zoom the image in. When zoomed in, it is easier to select shapes and such because the ovals become smaller as a percentage of the image.\nOn the subject, I wish someone would send me the OS X Preview source code so I can fix the infuriating bug where a selected object moves the tiniest bit when I'm just trying to select it, inevitably screwing up its oh so accurately located position. UGH!\n", "Q: How can I use Apple News without changing my region on macOS Mojave? I want to use Apple News on macOS but not to change my region to the United States. How can I do that?\n\nA: To access Apple News on Mac, simply enter this in Terminal. This will open the News app, no matter where it is located in on your Mac. As such, your region does not need to be set to the United States.\nopen -a \"News.app\"\n\nIf you want to access it conveniently, add the app to Dock.\n", "Q: MacBook 15\" (2017) - Battery Charging Problem Since yesterday my MacBook charges really slow, so I gave coconutBattery a try, and it showed that my MacBook is only charging with around 14 Watts. I am charging with an Apple 86W Power Supply.\n\nSo my question is with how much Watt are batteries supposed to charge?\n\nA: Checking your charging status within macOS\nmacOS provides a great deal of information about your power usage. To access this follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > About This Mac\n\n*Click on the System Report... button\n\n*In the left pane under the Hardware heading, select Power (it's about 2/3 of the way down)\n\n*On the right-hand side, scroll down to view the AC Charger Information\n\n*This will show you whether it's connected to a charger, the amount of wattage it's receiving, and if it's currently charging or not\n\n\nTypically for your model MBP it should show about 85W/86W when connected to an Apple 87W USB-C Power Adapter. Assuming you're getting this figure, you should be right in terms of your charge rate.\nAs for the figure in coconutBattery, remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*this will vary depending on how much load the MBP is currently under\n\n*it's not a reflection of the total wattage as most will be used by your MBP for its power requirements\n\n\nIf you're not seeing near the 85W/86W, then read on.\nI know you've stated that you've already reset the SMC, but I'd do both a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP. That is, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down for about 20 seconds or until you see the Apple logo\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go of the power button and wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n\nOnce you've reset the NVRAM and SMC use your MBP as usual and monitor the charging. If you still feel it's not charging as it normally would, then reset the SMC again but with the following steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Press and hold the right shift key and the left option and control keys for 7 seconds before then also pressing and holding the power button down for another 7 seconds (i.e. the keys will end up being held down for 14 seconds, the power button for 7 seconds)\n\n*Let go of all three keys and the power button\n\n*Wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n", "Q: What are all these tvOS services? I noticed Apple's tvOS broadcasting no less than 7 mDNS PTR-RRs (via Bonjour, I presume):\n+ Apple TV._airplay._tcp.local\n+ Apple TV._mediaremotetv._tcp.local\n+ Apple TV._companion-link._tcp.local\n+ 1BC5121395BA@Apple TV._raop._tcp.local\n+ 70-61-23-49.1Apple TV._sleep-proxy._udp.local\n+ BC69B8CC-AEE6-B37E-AAB3-E2D55C4DE0AA._homekit._tcp.local\n+ EC9ED9FECEDB93DFEE5A0AC02C0BA9A5CD8DDA27._touch-able._tcp.local\n\nNote: Unique, personally identifiable values have been randomized.\n\nIt seems like a lot. At first I thought it was only the first 5 (still seems like a lot). Some are obvious, others are.. not so much. But, pull the AppleTV's ethernet cable and watch them all disappear. \n\nA: The services are:\n._airplay._tcp.local\nThis is a Bonjour advertisement for the network service that enables AirPlay of video content. I.e. this allows iOS devices to discover the Apple TV as a \"remote display\" that it can display video on.\n._mediaremotetv._tcp.local\nThis is one of the network services that makes the Apple TV Remote work - i.e. the app or Control Center built-in feature for remote controlling Apple TV devices from iPhones and iPads. This service is advertised on the network via Bonjour to ensure that iOS devices can discover the AppleTV.\n._companion-link._tcp.local\nThis service is seemingly not documented by Apple, but seems involved in making the AirPlay 2 system work.\n._raop._tcp.local\nThis network service is called Remote Audio Output Protocol. It is essentially saying that the AppleTV works as an AirPlay audio receiver. This Bonjour advertisement allows iOS devices to discover the Apple TV as a \"speaker\" that you can send audio to.\n._sleep-proxy._udp.local\nThis is a Bonjour Sleep Proxy. The idea is that the AppleTV can respond to various network queries for other devices that are currently in low-power mode to lower energy usage. For example it could be a Mac offering a shared iTunes library or a shared printer. The AppleTV can then answer network requests for these servers while the Mac is in sleep mode - for example allowing the user to list the shared printers available on the network. However, when the user chooses to print something, the AppleTV will wake up the Mac and transfer the request to it.\n_homekit._tcp.local\nThis is a network service regarding HomeKit, Apple's system for communicating with and controlling devices in the home. Think controllable light bulbs, shades, door bells, whatever. The AppleTV works as a proxy in such a setting such that the user can control devices remotely (i.e. while not at home) even though the devices might be Bluetooth only and out of range. Note that ordinary HomeKit devices on the network advertise as _hap._tcp instead.\n._touch-able._tcp.local\nThis is another of the network services that makes the Apple TV Remote work. This service concerns device authentication. I.e. if you want to for example play a Youtube video on the Apple TV, the Apple TV can require that the device is authenticated before being allowed to do so. In practice authentications work by the Apple TV displaying a PIN-code on the TV that the user enters on the iOS device. This PIN-code is transferred using the service advertised as \"touch-able\" to authenticate the device.\n", "Q: Merging two disks to one? \nI installed MacOS on disk 0. I have one HDD drive which is split into multiple disks. Now I would like to merge disk 0 and disk 1 (same hdd) to one disk. Is it possible and what should I do? For illustration I have added a screenshot with the current partitioning. \n\nA: You can use Disk Utility.\nPersonally, I would copy all data from each partition to another storage device; creating a parent folder for each partition (using Finder); or, create a disk image (.dmg, etc.) file using Disk Utility.  Then, you can recover if anything goes wrong.  Here is an article describing the different types of disk images, how to make them, and why one might choose one over another:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/create-a-disk-image-dskutl11888/mac\nBut, if you intend to merge two partitions, both containing data, relying on a software process which cannot be undone (sans great expense, difficulty, and uncertainty)... you are braver than I am.\nHere is an article describing the different partitioning options:\nhttps://www.lifewire.com/disk-utility-add-delete-resize-existing-volumes-2260078\nIf you want to run any Erase security options, you are better off running them on each partition BEFORE deleting each.  But, if the HDD is a SSD (or FLASH), I believe those options are irrelevant.  Wherever you see \"APFS\", that volume is on a SSD (using MacOS 10.13 or later).\nIf either partition is bootable, you will need to make it bootable again.  I noticed that \"Install MacOS...\" is one of your partitions.  Here is an article describing how to use Terminal (sudo... createinstallmedia command) to do that:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nBut, I have never attempted to use a bootable installer partition for \"additional storage\"; may not work, or have unexpected results.\n\nA: Obvious, but it's gotta be said Back Up everything first.\nLooking through DiskUtil's Man page, I can't find a way you could do it without erasing both disks, so if you are wanting to just expand the installation on disk0 to envelop disk1, you'd probably be looking for some proprietary software to do it and I'm not even sure there would be anything out there capable with APFS (and the first page of a quick google search turned nothing up).\nThe mergePartition verb for diskutil sadly only works within one disk, not across two disks unless they are already joined together in an AppleRAID, CoreStorage or an APFS container. \nIf you don't mind erasing the disks and restoring your backups after the fact, then you can either run diskutil resetFusion, which will grab the two internal drives and set them up as a Fusion Drive configuration, or you can run diskutil APFS createContainer disk0 disk1, after which you will need to look up which \"diskx\" the new APFS container is, and then run diskutil APFS addVolume diskx APFS \"Macintosh HD\"\nIf you're using Time Machine for your backups, it should happily reinstall macOS and restore all your applications and data in one step for you. Just start up from the Time Machine Backup disk when you start up the computer, use diskutil on the internal drive from there, and then select \"Restore Backup\" from there instead of \"Reinstall macOS\" \n", "Q: How to remove restrictions in latest IOS?

I have MacBook Pro (15'', 2017 model). It comes with a very high voltage charger with USB type-C port. I have a hybrid converter (USB Type-C to VGA + USB Type-C + USB Type-A). I want to charge my Redmi 4 (India variant) device using a cable (USB Type-A to micro-USB). My phone supports unspecified version of Qualcomm quick charge (tested with a turbo-charger of Moto Phone).\nSo, the connection is as given below:\nMacBook Pro Charger -> USB Type-C to USB Type-C cable -> USB Type-C to Hybrid output converter including USB Type-A -> USB Type-A to micro-USB cable -> Redmi 4 device.\nWill above configuration damage my phone or charger? Also, will my phone be able to charge quickly as it supports unspecified version of Qualcomm quick charge?\n\nA: No, it will not damage your phone.\nWhether or not it will charge quickly depends on the specific kind of hybrid converter you have. Most likely it will not charge quickly, as the USB Type-A port is most commonly just at 500 mA, or 900 mA for some ports that USB 3.0. It is not common to see dedicated charging ports with higher amps in such hybrid converters.\n", "Q: Applescript : generate a new list based on existing list my script is generating a list (random number of items) and for each item I like to add a colour.\nI can do it manually :\n> set myList to {{\"demo\", \"#5cdf64\"}, {\"icloud.com\", \"#FFFF00\"}, {\"more\n> random e.g\", \"#FF0000\"}}\n\nbut how can I add a different colour automatically to the list and based on the number of item on the first list?\nI know how to count the primary list and do an action for each items :\nset listSize to count of myList\n\nset theList to {\"demo\", \"demo1\", \"demo2\", \"demo2\"}\nrepeat with a from 1 to length of theList\n    set theCurrentListItem to item a of theList\n    -- Process the current list item\n\nend repeat\n\nI think I'm nearly there the only thing is I'm not adding but replacing the items :\nset theList to {\"Demo\", \"ok\", \"blabla\", \"demo2\"}\nset ColortheList to {\"5cdf64\", \"FFFF00\", \"FF0080\", \"FF1000\"}\nset myNewList to \"\"\n\nrepeat with a from 1 to length of theList\n    set theCurrentListItem to item a of theList\n    set myNewList to {item a of theList, item a of ColortheList}\n\nend repeat\n\nalso tried\ncopy {item a of theList, item a of ColortheList} to myNewList\n\n\nA: If you're wanting myNewList to return a list of lists I think you're trying to do:\nset theList to {\"Demo\", \"ok\", \"blabla\", \"demo2\"}\nset ColortheList to {\"5cdf64\", \"FFFF00\", \"FF0080\", \"FF1000\"}\nset myNewList to {}\n\nrepeat with a from 1 to length of theList\n    copy ({item a of theList, item a of ColortheList}) to the end of the |myNewList|\nend repeat\n\nreturn myNewList\n\nA little fun with random number.

I would not like to consume any mobile data (for Internet/background activity).\nI wish to use the SIM card solely for making and receiving phone calls. I would only like to use Internet via free Wi-Fi whenever it is available.\nIs it possible to use my SIM card on international roaming on my iPhone 6 this way? I wish to minimize international roaming costs.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to use your SIM card with international roaming without using any data. Just make sure the Mobile Data is turned off under Settings app → Mobile Data on your iPhone 6.\n \nAdditionally, under Settings app → Mobile Data → Mobile Data Options, you can choose to turn off Data Roaming. This is a smart settings which will prevent data usage while roaming. (You may have your reservations regarding this setting, but turning off Mobile Data gives complete peace of mind).\nAs long as the Mobile Data is turned off, you’ll be fine. No app will do any data transfer/use Internet this way (as long as Wi-Fi is also turned off).\n", "Q: How to get Night Shift on both external monitors? I just surprisingly find that only one of my two external monitors gets Night Shift effects. Can anyone tell me how I can make both work with Night Shift?\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15 inch, 2017)\n\n*macOS 10.14\n\n*Both monitors are LG Ultra HD (27', 4K), connected with USB-C <-> mini DP cable.\n\n\n\n\nA: As the linked answers mention, disabling + re-enabling Night Shift seems to make things work fine. That said...\nMy guess is that \"Night Shift\" works by modifying the display profiles for monitors (certainly works that way for f.lux, you can see the display profile change in System Preferences). This happens on my system, and my suspicion is that I have two monitors with the same name (and EDID info, which is probably the actual identifier) => macOS can't figure out that both monitors are supposed to get the display profiles updated, and only one works correctly.\n\n", "Q: Will data be lost in resetting macOS admin password? My GF recently started working with a Mac and while I'm a IT tech with Linux and Windows knowledge, I'm very much a noob with Macs.\nThe problem is she's working on a Mac that another user (the guy she replaced) set a admin password, now no one knows said password neither does he pick up the phone.\nI've seen there’s a way to create a new admin account via this post:\nHow can I get admin access to a Mac without knowing the current password?\nMy question is will she loose any data from the old account? She has some projects and such (I know the keychain will be lost, but she has all the passwords she needs).\n\nA: As you mentioned, credentials will be lost including the Keychain, but files will be preserved. You can either create a new account, log into it and change the permissions on the original account’s home folder to be able to access the files, or reset the password to the existing administrator account and log into that. The former will preserve the Keychain in case the password is recovered while still giving access to the files.\n", "Q: How do not lock/sleep MacBook when you close the laptop lid?

Typically child-process will be services of the parent. On macOS many of these child processes will be XPC instances.\nServices are Processes\nOn macOS, daemons are processes and services are processes. In your example, com.apple.audio.SandboxHelper, this is an XPC service.\n\nA: Technically speaking, anything that gets loaded and executed is a process; so a service is a process.\nA service is a nuanced definition of something that gets loaded to provide a service like DHCP or DNS.\nA alternative way to sum this up is all services are processes, but not all processes are services.  An example would be Firefox, it's a process, but not a service - it's an application.\n", "Q: Why do most processes run as children of launchd? When did most processes run as a child of launchd instead of the kernel pid ?\n\nA: macOS comes from the Unix tradition of operating systems. Here processes are arranged in a tree, i.e. a hierarchy with parent and child processes. \nFrom this follows that there most be a root process from which other processes are spawned. This process on modern macOS is launchd.\nOn earlier versions of OS X a process named initd took the place of launchd. Launchd is essentially a modern replacement and superset of initd.\nThere’s no inherent “offering” in having launchd as your parent process.\nThe reason it is not for example kernel_task is that it stands for computation that happens in kernel mode - i.e. a privileged mode on the CPU.\nLaunchd is the first user-mode process started by the kernel when the system boots. User-mode means that it is less privileged than kernel mode. Launchd then handles starting the rest of the processes necessary to have a working, usable system.\n", "Q: Do executables in OS X need to be built in specific way to be used as a service? Does an OS X executables need to be built in specific way (e.g. no UI, implement certain interfaces) so it can be used as a service?  Does this vary by its language (e.g. Objective C, Java) or its implementation (compiled versus script)?\n\nA: An executable on macOS can be run as a service or application almost regardless of how it is created.\nThe question to ask is, does the process require access to the WindowServer? The WindowServer is needed to provide a graphical interface.\nGraphical User Interface and User Sessions\nA process requiring a graphical user interface can be used as a background process or service. Do this by launching the process with launchd from the /Library/LaunchAgents folder.\nTo present a graphical user interface, the process must be launched within a user session. In launchd terms this means within an Aqua environment.\nAn example of this would be Power Manager's pmuser process. This process manages tasks specific to the user and handles tasks that the computer wide pmd process can not directly perform.\nComputer Wide Processes\nA process that does not require a user interface can be launched as a background service with launchd from the /Library/LaunchDaemons folder.\nA non-graphical process can exist outside of any user session and thus run even when no-one is logged in.\nA computer wide process can not access much of macOS's unique functionality.

Read the INVOCATION section of the bash man page for the specifics but briefly for a login shell it will read bash_profile (along with other things), and for a non-login shell, it will read bashrc (along with other things).

Is there a way to disable SIP without being able to see a display, or a route that would be able to display via a third-party GPU?\nThanks\n\nA: You should be able to use the keyboard in order to boot into recovery mode and execute the command while \"blind\". Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Mac while holding down the ⌘+R keys.\n\n*Wait 3-5 minutes for your computer to boot up.

Any other user is available! How can I download the installer from other PC. Is there any link ?\n\nA: \nHow can I download the installer from other PC. Is there any link?\n\nOfficially?  No.\nOS X/macOS is provided at no cost (to the contrary, it's not \"free\") to customers who own a qualifying Apple computer.  They do not make it available for download like CentOS or Ubuntu makes their distribution available \"free of charge.\"\nAs such, Apple has made it so that the installer can only be downloaded to a Mac in Recovery Mode or via the App Store.\nSo, right now, you have but one (proper) method to install macOS - install it via Recovery.\nLooking back....\n\nI have formatted my MacBook Air....\n\n(This is intended to be a note of caution)\nBefore you did this, you should have at least had:\n\n*\n\n*A Time Machine backup of your existing installation/data\n\n*A full and thorough understanding of the procedure to (re)install/upgrade macOS\n\n*The necessary tools (i.e. the bootable USB)\n\nThere are countless problems that can be fixed with the phrase \"restore from backup\" and this, too is one of them.\nLooking forward...\n\nIs there any way that I can install it through bootable pen-drive or the other way?\n\nThere's only one \"proper\" method, and that's to obtain it from Apple (via Recovery, App Store or even a friend/colleague who owns an Apple.)  Short of that, you are left with questionable (at best) solutions for this - download a USB image from a Torrent (I'm not listing any here).\nObviously, you can do this from a PC running Windows or Linux, but you need the USB image because you will have very little success converting an ISO (CD/DVD image) to a USB image (.img).\nYou can create image using dd (assuming you're on Linux) with this simple command:\n$ dd if=/path/to/usbimage.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\nObviously, you want to change the filename of the image and the output device (of=) to their appropriate and respective values.\nNow, here's the key.  Once you have it installed, download a legitimate copy from App Store.  Create a new USB installer on a different USB and do the whole process all over again.  If it fails, you have the first \"torrented\" USB image from which to work from again.  If not, you will now have the ability to create a legitimate  macOS installation.\n", "Q: WhatsApp calls with background data disabled With Mobile Data and background app refresh turned off, can WhatsApp receive a call while the Wi-Fi is enabled, and the iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi access point with active Internet connection?\nIf the iPhone is resting on a table, will I receive a normal WhatsApp call or not? Or will it remain closed, unless I pick the mobile in hand and turn-on the screen.\nI will be using my iPhone in another country with international roaming active.\n\nA: Yes, you will receive the calls on WhatsApp normally, even with the background data turned off as long as you are connected to the Internet (via Wi-Fi in your case).\nWhatsApp makes use of a framework called VoIPKit available in iPhone software development kit, which enables it to receive audio/video calls even when in background/not running status or with the device in sleep mode/locked state/screen turned off.\n", "Q: Merge partitions after windows installation failure After windows failed to install, I was left with my partition, which bootcamp was supposed to remove but it froze and I exited it (probably not the brightest idea ever).

Is this a new Mojave 10.14.2 bug or what?  How the heck do I get out of this?  Thanks! \n\nA: This new requirement to authorize Microphone was added in macOS Mojave (10.14). \nThe answer from Redarm is very good, and the best answer for people using macOS Mojave (10.14). But there is a slightly better option for people using macOS Catalina (10.15) or newer. This will reset the privacy settings for QuickTime Player only, without affecting microphone permission settings for other applications.\ntccutil reset Microphone com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\n\nNote that you must quit and restart QuickTime Player after running this command.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone, unlock the preference pane by clicking the padlock symbol at the bottom left of the window and tick \"QuickTime Player.app\", which should be listed without a tick mark in its checkbox.\nIf QuickTime Player.app is missing, you should be able to reset all decisions you made for the various applications that asked for access to your Microphone by quitting System Preferences, opening Terminal (to be found in /Applications/Utilities/, or search via Spotlight) and running the following command:\ntccutil reset Microphone\n\n...then press enter.\nThis should clear all applications from the Microphone section and after launching QuickTime Player, it should ask for permission to the microphone all over again.\n\nA: For me QuickTime was not sharing my iphone screen as well.

However after a minor Apple update I did through the App Store (I'm currently still on macOS High Sierra) I wasn't able to see my back up drive on my desktop when I plug it in. \nI went into Disk Utility and saw it there, but the volume partition is greyed out and 'not mounted' appears. But, when I click on Mount, nothing happens.\nI had this problem last year. However, Mount wasn't an option and Apple Support told me to erase the disk and I lost everything, although that didn't matter. What I have on it now would be useful to keep though. \n\nIs my data safe on the drive? How can I fix this?\n\nA: Running First Aid from inside Disk Utility might be the way to go. If it successfully repairs the volume it will mount it straight away. If it can't successfully repair the volume, it will attempt to mount it in a ready only form, and if it can you'll be able to copy things back off it before reformatting.\nDepending how important your data on there is, you may want to look into software for data recovery first, or use the dd command to make a bit-for-bit copy of the whole disk so that if you can't get the disk to mount again, you have a copy of it's state, and you can run data recovery software over that to try put your files back together and recover them. dd will make a disk image the size of the whole disk though, so you will need somewhere with at least 500gb of space to store that.\nAn example of a dd to run in the terminal:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=/Volumes/OtherExternalDrive/diskImage.img conv=noerror\n\nif= is input file, which in this case is disk2 (based on your screenshot above). I use rdisk instead of just disk as it usually runs a bit faster (I looked into why a while back but can't remember now, but did test it out when I had an explanation and found it usually was about 40% faster at the time).\nof= is the output file, which I've given the example of being on an external disk. (I'm assuming since this 500gb disk was your time machine backup, that your internal disk is also 500gb or less).\nThe output disk image will always be a .img file, if you specify for example .dmg, you when up with diskimage.dmg.img. .img is pretty standard so you shouldn't have much trouble with software reading it.\nconv=noerror means if it received an I/O Error while reading the disk, it will continue trying to read the rest, instead of quoting halfway through. If you are getting a bunch of these, it may be worth trying a new USB cable, but if you still get them, the Hard Drive is failing.\nIf this is the second time the drive has become unmountable, then it does sound like something hardware might be going on, so if your USB cable if looking funky, you might need a new one, or the hard drive might be finally giving up. \nUnless of course you often disconnect it without hitting eject, that will easily lead to filesystem issues ^_^\ngood luck!\n", "Q: iPhone 6: Mobile data activation when on international roaming I am travelling to a different country.

Just purchased a Samsung T5 SSD 1TB drive and want to run Windows 10 and various other linux distros (Elementary, Mint, Parrot Security, Kali) on it so I could take the drive with me and either boot from my mac or another computer.  I got Windows 10 to work by following   \nhttps://9to5mac.com/2017/08/31/how-windows-10-mac-boot-camp-external-drive-video/\nI was successfully able to boot between Mojave (on MBP HD) and Win10 (External SSD) by holding down Option key as it boots.  I then made a bootable USB stick with Elementary OS and booted to that stick.  I had already created a partition for the Elementary OS but went ahead and allowed it to partition it the way it wanted to during the install menus.  I chose the partition that I had made before to which it changed it to EXT4.  Then I created another smaller partition for swap.  Once Elementary was installed, it asked for me to reboot.  I held down Option and saw my MacOS drive, Windows (External SSD, which was actually the Elementary OS) and then EFI (External SSD, which was the Win10).  I tried to boot into Elementary OS and just had a flashing cursor at the top and nothing else.  Trying to boot into Win10, it would not get past the choosing where you want to boot from.  Like it was locked up.  Any ideas on how I can get this to work?\n\nA: A short answer to your question will not fix your problem, but at least you may become more aware of the difficulties installing other operating systems on Macs.\nBoth Windows and Elementary install their boot files in the hidden EFI partition. When holding down the option key at startup, you invoke the Mac (firmware) Startup Manager. This startup manager does not detect all possible correctly installed operating systems. \n\nThe Mac Startup Manager assumes each EFI partition will only contain at most the boot files for a single operation system.\n\nWhile both Windows and Elementary are using the same EFI partition, you will not be able to use the Mac Startup Manager to boot both operating systems.\nPossible solutions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use more than one EFI partition. A drive can have more than one EFI partition. Additional EFI partitions do not have to reside at the beginning of the drive.\n\n*Use a different startup manager. A free startup manager would be rEFInd. I prefer to install rEFInd so this manager can be booted from the Mac Startup Manager, the rEFInd will then allow you to select other operating systems. Actually, rEFInd instructs the Mac firmware to boot the selected operating system.\n\n\nBTW, I have found difficulty installing most versions of Linux to use an EFI partition other than the default. I usually have to manually move the Linux boot files to an alternate EFI partition. Also, care must be taken to insure any Windows boot files are not overwritten by a Linux installer. The file that usually is overwritten is EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi. This file is copy of the EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file. \nYou can access any EFI partition from macOS. To access the primary EFI partition on the first internal drive from the Finder, enter the command give below in a Terminal application window.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\nTo unmount, enter the command given below.\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nIn your case, make the appropriate substitution for your external drive.\nBelow are the elementary boot files store in the EFI partition. This image was captured from an VirtualBox install. Note: the files EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi and EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi are identical.\n\n", "Q: Can I delete StoreData found at /private/var/log/powermanagement/StoreData?

Will deleting the file cause any problems for my system? Do I need to re-create a blank StoreData file somehow? If so, what is the file extension?\n\nA: Answers to your questions as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can safely remove the /private/var/log/powermanagement/StoreData file as suggested. If you're overly concerned about it, feel free to just make a copy of it first before trashing it. \nNote: You'll be prompted for an Admin password before being able to move it to Trash.\n\n*No, deleting the file will not cause any problems for your system.\n\n*No, you do not need to recreate the file.  It'll automatically be recreated again when needed.

My iPhone is not connected to my iMac. When I tap on it, it opens a new tab with Wikipedia.\n\nA: This is due to an iCloud feature called iCloud Tabs. From the Apple Support document, Set up and use iCloud Tabs:\n\niCloud keeps the tabs you have open in Safari up to date on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. That means you can go from one device to the next and pick up browsing wherever you left off.\n\nTo enable iCloud Tabs, you need to enable Safari under iCloud in Settings app on your iOS device(s) and iCloud System Preference pane in System Preferences on your Mac(s).\n\n\niCloud for Safari is enabled by default when setting up a new iOS/macOS device.\nWith iCloud for Safari enabled, the browsing history (along with other data such as history, bookmarks etc.) are automatically kept in sync across all the devices setup with same iCloud Apple ID.\nYou can see open tabs on other iOS/macOS devices on any of your iOS/macOS devices. As an example this is what a web-page open on an iPhone/Mac looks like on a Mac/iPhone and vice versa.\nIn Safari on your iPhone, tap on the show all tabs button (shown towards bottom right corner), scroll down past all open tabs to see the tabs open on other devices:\n \nIn Safari on your Mac, invoke the Menu bar command View → Show Tab Overview or use the keyboard shortcut, Shift + Command + \\, and scroll down past all open tabs to see the tabs open on other devices:\n \nThe name above the line (iMac in your case) is the name of the device, and just below is a list of all the open web-pages on the device showing the title of the web-page.\nThus, Access Restricted is the title of the web-page shown on your iMac whose name is apparently iMac. Tapping on it opens it on your iPhone.\nTo change the machine name to something else (instead of iMac), go to System Preferences app → Sharing on your iMac and set the value for Computer Name.\n\n", "Q: Is iMessage open source?

It's been updated many times, even to v1.8 with no problems. But now, when I uninstall and then try to reinstall it, apparently I don't own the app.\n\nIs there any way to get this app back? I am able to go through iCloud purchase records if I need to show them to Apple.\n\nA: The first thing to do is to confirm a couple things. Namely, you need to confirm:\n\n\n*\n\n*you're logged into the same Apple ID account as you used when originally purchasing Minecraft, and\n\n*that you're trying to install the same version of the Minecraft game you previously purchased.\n\n\nLet me clarify the second point. When I say 'same version' I don't mean the same version number, but the same game within the Minecraft franchise. In your screenshot you're showing Minecraft Pocket Edition. This is not the same as Minecraft.\nOnce you've confirmed the two points above, then take a look at Redownload apps, music, movies, TV shows, and books from the App Store, iTunes Store, and Apple Books on Apple's website.\nIf this doesn't help, then use Apple's Get Support option. \nAnother option is if you’ve got a prior version of it backed up somewhere (eg Time Machine etc), you could then install it via an appropriate version of iTunes or Apple Configurator (see this question). But, I really think Apple can sort it out for you. You’ll probably have to be patient though, it may take a few days especially at this time of year.\n", "Q: Does App transfer between developers necessitate a re-purchase by end users? If an app gets transferred from one developer to another, does it necessitate a re-purchase?\nFrom the App Store Connect, App transfer overview page:\n\nYou transfer an app when you’ve sold the app to another developer or you want to move it to another App Store Connect account or organization.\nYou can transfer the ownership of an app to another developer without removing the app from the App Store. The app retains its reviews and ratings during and after the transfer, and users continue to have access to future updates. Additionally, when an app is transferred, it maintains its Bundle ID — it's not possible to update the Bundle ID after a build has been uploaded for the app.\n\nI have purchased a free/paid app from the App Store but it is not currently installed on the device. In the meanwhile, the original developer of the app decides to sell away the ownership to someone else.\nAs an end user who previously bought the app, (and any associated in-app purchases,)will this necessitate a re-purchase? i.e. will the app remain linked to my Apple ID or not?\nEmphasis on the fact that the app is not currently installed on device. The linked documentation does mention that the users will continue to have access to future updates, but I am looking for an authoritative documentation which answers the query. (Or someone who had personal experience with this scenario)\n\nA: There's no 100% certainty here, but let me explain that because it's not as bad as it first sounds.\nAssuming your Apple ID has previously purchased the app (either free or paid), then it doesn't matter if the app is installed on any of your current devices. The purchase is in that Apple ID's purchase history and it still has access to both redownload the app and to future updates.\nHowever, the reason this isn't 100% certain is because the developer may choose to no longer offer the app for sale and/or offer the availability of older versions to users who are not on the latest version of iOS. Let me explain with the following scenario.\nScenario\nLet's say you purchased app XYZ on an iPhone 6s with iOS 9 installed. You continued to update XYZ from version 1 up to and including version 3. You then purchase an iPhone X (with iOS 11) and decide to start from scratch in terms of what apps you install and you don't install XYZ. In the meantime, the developer of XYZ transfers the app to another developer. This new developer continues to maintain and update the app which is now at version 5.\nApple then releases iOS 13 and the new developer updates XYZ to version 6. However, upon doing so, they decide to edit the list of last compatible app versions so that moving forward only versions 5 and 6 are available for download. However, because you're still on iOS 11, when you try to install the app it isn't available. \nOf course, in the above scenario, you could just update to iOS 12 (or iOS 13) and the app will then be available.\nAdditionally, as alluded to earlier, the developer may choose to remove the app from sale in which case you also will be unable to install it again.\nNOTE:- The original/existing developer of an app can also remove it from sale or edit the last compatible app versions list, in which case the end result would be the same.\n\nA: No re-purchase is necessary for the end-user - you'll be able to both download the app and receive updates in the future. The app remains listed as a Purchase on your Apple-ID, so it doesn't matter if the app is actually installed on your device or not.\nAs you've requested a reply from someone with personal experience, I can say that I have tried this in practice - and it works like described.\nThe only real change visible to users is that if the app is part of keychain sharing group, the user will have to login once again after installing the first update from the new developer.\nApart from that - everything else is technically exactly as if the original developer hadn't transferred the app, i.e. the new developer can choose to remove the app from sale, stop doing updates for it, make it incompatible with older devices, create updates that remove functionality, etc. - but the original developer could have done the same.\n\nA: The transfer does not cause an app to change a bundle.\n\n\n*\n\n*The transfer could allow the new developer force a re-download by changing the Bundle ID.\n\n\nOne additional complication is  that iOS data storage can be designed as part of a group. Think Microsoft Office - the data storage containers are combined several apps with different Bundle ID share a data storage group.\nIf an app was transferred away from group storage, that would break the app. It’s almost certain the new developer is then forced by Apple to change the BundleID before shipping a new build.

I done this through the Manage Storage section (not through the actual Notes app), and when I went into the Notes app the next day to try and retrieve them, not only was there nothing in my recently deleted, but the entire \"On My iPhone\" notes folder had been completely removed without a trace.\nI've tried to retrieve them through several apps such as FoneLab, iMyFone and PhoneRescue to no avail. I was wondering if I've left it too late and/or the manner in which I deleted them - through the Manage Storage section and also apparently as an entire folder, not as individual notes - means they are permanently gone?\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nMany thanks.\n\nA: If you haven't got backups of your device, it is very unlikely that you'll be able to retrieve these notes after 8 months. If you've left the device on the shelf, powered off for those 8 months, there's a slim chance - but if you have used the device, it is extremely unlikely.\nYou'll have to take the iPhone to a lab that does recovery from the flash storage devices on iPhones. It will be costly, and there's really only a very, very slim small chance that your notes can be found again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to combine two iPhones with tethering to increase bandwidth or fault tolerance? I'm using a MacBook as a \"server\" and want to keep it always connected to the internet, over cellular. \nI have two mobile phones (one GSM, one CDMA) and would like to connect to each of them to achieve fault tolerance, or ideally, increased bandwidth.\nIs there any way for me to\n\n\n*\n\n*Simultaneously connect to two iPhones \n\n*Use the joined connection for fault tolerance, or increased bandwidth \n\n\nI have the option to use Wifi, USB-C, or bluetooth to combine these phones, in any combination \n\nA: Technically speaking, you can connect two iPhones simultaneously; it's called multi-homing (this is good for fault tolerance).  The pf firewall has this capability and is built into macOS, but writing the rules file is outside the scope of this question.\nHowever, you can't combine the bandwidth to get a larger \"pipe.\"  You'll still have two smaller pipes.   In order to combine bandwidth, you will need to aggregate the pipes or bond them which is something that the ISP/carrier will need to do for you - different carriers (GSM and CDMA) are very unlikely to do this.\n", "Q: TestFlight download link returning HTTP error 404?

On the 2018 seamless design (matte finish / no lightning connector) Apple Pencil with the 2018 iPad Pro (USB C charger) I'm not seeing a way to give a name to the Apple Pencil that shows when I charge it.\nIs there a setting that lets you name the pencil similar to on macOS where you can name bluetooth accessories?\n\nA: On iOS 12.1.1 and lower, there is no way to name pencils if you have more than one or just wish to see a different name when it connects or looking at the battery levels.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can open settings app and see the serial number of the paired pencil if you tap in General and look towards the bottom of the data. Tap Apple Pencil and you can see details.\n\n*You can't edit the name in the bluetooth settings - but the name there does match what's shown elsewhere \"Apple Pencil\" in English.\n\n", "Q: Where did this iCloud profile avatar come from? I created an iCloud account for my daughter, and her profile has an avatar assigned to it that I didn’t choose:\n\nI think it’s Stitch from the Disney film Lilo and Stitch and appears in my daughter’s contact record and in the family iCloud settings. The picture has been on the account since the moment I created it, and my daughter does not currently know of the existence of this account (or currently have any iOS devices), so can not have uploaded it herself. \nWas this automatically selected by Apple? I created an account for my son last year and it didn’t have an avatar, and neither does my own, so I was wondering if this could have been picked up from another service she has a profile on (although I checked Gravatar and she doesn’t have one on there).  \n\nA: The person signed in to iCloud can upload any image they choose and no avatar is chosen by Apple. On macOS there are some generic account photos so your question makes great sense, but iCloud has no such stock content supplied.\nTo date, everything is a digital file that someone uploads from the photos app or loaded with intention in to the iCloud control apps (settings / system preferences) or web site. \nTell your daughter she has good taste and I’ll encourage you and your son to start having fun with art or photos that reduce to a set of pixels. \n\nA: I asked her (without giving away why) if she’s used this as a profile picture elsewhere and she told me it’s the pic on her YouTube profile. I added her Google  email address as a secondary email (for account recovery) when I created her iCloud account, so Apple must have scraped her Google account for a profile picture. \n", "Q: Automatic downloads in iTunes & App stores UPDATES on In my iPhone 6 iTunes and App stores there is automatic downloads in which my Updates are on. Can I keep these Updates on or shall I turn off to prevent mobile data usage on roaming, or will these updates only happen on Wifi?\n\nA: It's a configurable option.\n\nYou can also turn Automatic Downloads on or off over your cellular network on an iPhone or iPad Wi-Fi + Cellular. Go to Settings > [your name] > iTunes & App Store and turn Use Cellular Data on or off. Cellular Data downloads are limited to a file size of 150 MB or smaller.\n\n\n", "Q: Does Automatic Downloads on iPhone 6 use cellular data on international roaming? Under Automatic Downloads for iTunes & App Stores, there's a setting for downloading app Updates.\nDoes it use cellular data while on international roaming?\n\nA: Whether to download app updates over Mobile Data is a user configurable setting. Go to Settings app → iTunes & App Store and turn off Use Mobile Data. This will ensure that app updates are not downloaded over mobile data even if it is enabled. \nThis setting doesn't take into account device roaming status (which itself is configurable under Settings app → Mobile Data).\n\nEven if Use Mobile Data is enabled here, it still needs the Mobile Data itself to be enabled under Settings → Mobile Data.\nIf you are concerned about using data while roaming, turning off Mobile Data under Settings will ensure that no cellular data usage will happen.\n", "Q: When and by who was a password changed I have created a specific account on my Mac (called skype) to use with risky software, Skype. This account is a standard account.\nSince I didn't want to use this account very often, I saved its password in an encrypted file and I am fully sure of the password. \nToday I can't login on this account.

If they are turned off then the features are disabled for all users at the login window, ( but can be turned on ...) Then it says if a feature is ON and has the the \" * \" like  Accessibility Keyboard * and Switch Control * do then your own ( your Admin account) configurations will be used for all users at the login window.   I think by default these are all checked.  I unchecked them. But someone should add info if its ok to uncheck them because I do have trackpad problems that I'm trying to figure out. \n\nA: If you go to System Preferences, Users and Groups then unlock it and click parental controls for the standard user you can see what the actual setting are that the account has. When I did that I found that in the Finder setting there were apps that were checked that I did not even know I had on my computer. I just wonder if they are third party apps that can gain access to change passwords. Also the last tab is Other and has a button called Log that can show you what has been going on going back over time.   \nAlso I have created a Standard user that I typed very confidently 3 times in a row for it to finally let me in. \n", "Q: IOS 12.1.1 won't sync contacts to google I am trying to push all of my iPhone contacts into my Google contacts in preparation for dumping my iPhone. IOS 12.1.1 is different than all previous versions in this respect.\nHere's my current settings:\nSettings->Accounts->Gmail : Contacts is turned on. Shows my google account.\nSettings->Accounts->Fetch New Data: Gmail show Fetch, Every 15 minutes.\nSettings->Accounts->Passwords: Shows correct password for my google account.\nAccount->Advanced: Use SSL turned on. Server Port 993.\nVerified that I can log into my google account from Safari.\nMy iPhone contacts shows 220 contacts. My google contacts shows 144 contacts. Google is missing everything manually entered into my iPhone this year.\nI also tried iTunes, syncing to Windows Contacts. It picked up only 76 of the 220 contacts. Also tried iCloud. That picked up the same 76. If I put together what Google shows with the iCloud/Windows Contacts, I think all 220 contacts shown on the iPhone are there.\nExasperated.\nTIA.\n\nA: Did you check in the settings of the Contacts app that the default account is set to your Gmail account? I suspect that the presumably missing contacts ended up in iCloud instead of Gmail. If you set the Default Account to Gmail new contacts created on your iPhone will automatically sync with Goolge Contacts.\nRegarding your existing Contacts in iCloud:\nThe easiest way to move your contacts from iCloud to your Gmail Account is to use the Contacts app on your Mac. Add the same Gmail Account to your Mac and drag’n’drop the contacts from iCloud to your Gmail Account. I don’t think a way exists to do the same directly on an iPhone.\n\n\nA: Contacts that are in the iPhone's Contacts account do not sync to Google.  That's not how it works.  You're thinking of it as being a single container of data on the phone, and it's not, each account has its own.  That's why the phone has the setting allowing you to choose what the default Contacts destination is.\nThere are several apps available in the app store that will take the iPhone Contacts and sync them to some other account on the phone.\nI have used Contacts Mover, https://contactmoverapp.com, for this purpose.\n", "Q: Frequent freezing and random reboots in iMac (2015) running Mojave After upgrading my 2015 iMac (Intel i5, 8GB RAM, 1TB Fusion Drive) to Mojave I been having nothing more then headache. \nIt all started with WiFi randomly dropping and when I navigate to the WiFi menu I'm greeted with spinner of death. With only solution is to restart or to logout, unless the whole system lags out and then you have to physically power it down.\nThe other issue is partially related to WiFi is that when WiFi drops it seem's to kill whatever Browser is running, at first I though it was Chrome acting up as it's a major RAM hog, but this also seems to happen to Opera but less frequently. \nWhen the Browser crashes you can \"Kill Process\" but even so you will still have the Browser window overlay everything with no ability to Hide or Close it. Again at this point you can't use Navigation menu's as such you have to physically power it down.\nAnd last issue is that I can be working on something and when I come back I'm greeted by Login screen, because for whatever reason the OS restarted itself. Same seems to happen when I try to use the computer in the morning, the iMac is once again has rebooted somewhere over night. Mind you the iMac runs 24/7 like most of PC's I owned and have.\nSo what troubleshooting solutions did I partake? \n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC on the iMac (Performed this task, no result)\n\n*Reset NVRAM on the iMac (Performed this task, no result)\n\n*Check Disk (Performed this task, no result, no errors found)\n\n*Auto Updates is Disabled and is set to Manual\n\n\nI will say for the record after random reboots I installed a copy of Windows 10 along the OSX, and guess what I at times come back to Windows 10 booted up. However Windows 10 does not seem to suffer from this Random Reboots, so I'm gonna guess the Reboots are isolated to Mojave.\nAny suggestions? At this point I either have to figure how to downgrade or to backup everything and try to do a clean install.\n\nA: My friend, I noticed something similar with my iMac 14,2 made in 2013.   My iMac began to do kernel panics or reboot, denying me use of my machine.\nI narrowed the problem down to the wireless, there appears to be a potentially exploitable bug involved, and the solution I have used for some years now is to simply turn off the wireless interface in network systems preferences.  This has afforded my the ability to use my machine without problems.\nF.\n\nA: After trying to figure out as much as possible, I concluded that I had a botched update. As such I decided to backup needed files and downgrade to High Sierra build.\n", "Q: Hiding the quoted messages in Mail? In the Mail application, when I choose the option \"see more from \" the app unfolds the replied messages in different colors as quoted texts. How can we undo the unfolding and hide the quoted text? It is so messy right now.\nPlease see the image below for the part that I want to hide.\n\n\nA: From the list of mails, change the mail and come back to the previous one. It automatically folds all the quotes, when you revisit it.\n\nA: You can choose to make them white. Open Mail from your Dock, then next to the Apple icon upper left corner click Mail, preferences, Fonts and Colors tab, uncheck color or make them white.\n", "Q: My phone number has been “ghosted”. Is there anything I can do about that? I’m now receiving phone calls from my own number. This ghosting of numbers has gotten completely out of hand! Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: If your carrier won't block these, I suppose you could add your own number to a contact called \"Telemarket Spam\" and then block that caller.\nThere are apps that let you make rules like \"block all calls from the same 212-335-xxxx\" area and then you would need to change your number to be in an area you're OK not ever getting a call from (if you're not already in that situation).\nThis is kind of like spam email - there's nothing from preventing anyone from sending mail as you - same as no one will police a phone scammer that sets your number as their \"caller id\". Unless the laws change in your area or your carrier decides to crack down, you have to block these or just not answer calls from anyone not in your address book by turning on \"do not disturb\".\nTo summarize, on iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*use do not disturb and white list callers you don't mind ringing through\n\n*use a third party call screening app to set up rules and maintain a database of scammy numbers. These are all on the App Store and most are paid or they sell your number/call history to more scammers (or possibly both)\n\n*use the blocking feature for specific black listed numbers\n\n\nIn your case, blocking your number seems the easiest fix for that specific malfeasance.\n", "Q: Would MacBook Air 2018 handle a constant run of a Windows VM for the Development My work involves having both Mac and Windows on a laptop.\nWhile I need Mac for Xcode, I do some ASP.NET stuff tightly coupled with the Windows ecosystem.\nI wonder if a MacBook Air CPU with 16 GB RAM would be enough to handle VMware Fusion with a couple of Visual Studio instances and debugging ASP.NET sites with the database on local MS SQL server?\nThere is an option of getting 13\" MacBook Pro for a performance boost but I am frustrated with the touchbar as it's harder to use it with my fingers muscle memory. I'd like to avoid it as much as possible.\n\nA: In general, MacBook Air's can handle run anything constantly, that they can handle running for a short while. You cannot \"overwork\" the computer so to say - it won't suddenly break or stop working for that reason.\nAnd yes, MacBook Air's in general can handle running VMware Fusion (if the model you have is supported by VMware Fusion). You decide yourself how much RAM you dedicate to the virtual machine, when setting it up - so 16 GB will make it possible to run multiple virtual machines.\nIf you want to have a clearer idea of the amount of RAM needed, you'll need to setup the system you want and check how much RAM it uses.\n\nA: I would recommend you go with the device that's light like a MacBook or Air and do your heavy lifting in Azure or on a cheap NUC / commodity hardware. Build and test the VM out on your portable, then move them off when they need extra RAM / CPU / threads or several people will test against them.\nIt's possible to run Windows on bare metal but that's a hassle to hard partition your storage and if you choose wrong, it's a pain to fix the partitions. Virtual is so much better whether it's ESXi on a home lab or Fusion on top of macOS.\nVisual Studio runs incredibly well in a small Azure VM for pennies a day and you only pay for it when you start it up. Deallocate the machine when you're not using it and it's essentially free.\nI do the above with a 2015 MacBook / 1.1 GHz mobile CPU / 8 GB RAM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Negative wise - Fusion and Docker on the SSD perform just amazingly well for light work, but if you have 2 beefy VM that belong on 8 cores, you'll not be happy. \n\n*Positive wise - MacBook 2015 and up runs 4K display amazingly well, charge over USB C with a suitable display. I'd have thought I'd need more horsepower 18 months ago, but Azure and home lab setup let me run the SQL/ASP.NET/IIS loads off the Mac and I just make the scripts / see the pixels locally. As long as I'm connected to power, I have no issues running it at full CPU.\n\n*The new Air will thermally throttle less than my MacBook and the MacBook Pro will run substantially more CPU before thermally slowing (possibly three instances of Windows based on how much work you hammer them with). You won't harm it at 100% usage - just the Air and MacBook line don't dissipate heat and throttle the CPU sooner than the Pro or iMac. This Mac is a dream machine to me for how well it's been usable for hard core infrastructure and dev-ops tasks.\n\n\nFor the price of a beefy MacBook Pro I'll always go with an SSD iMac or Mac mini and the Air/MacBook (or even the iPad Pro now) - but that's my preference and I get why some people prefer to spend the $3k-$4k all on one machine. I want super fast and super small and to develop the install scripts then automate making them on virtual servers whether they're in the cloud / data center / or co-located in my office at home.\n", "Q: Drag and Drop email to Desktop When I drag and drop an email to the Desktop it always moves to the top right (or the first free space near the top right).

What can I do to make it go back to normal speeds? I initially thought it had something to do with the mac firewall, but I'm not so sure. \nThanks\nUPDATE\nnever mind, the problem seemed to fix itself somehow. wifi is now back to normal and full functioning\n\nA: Uninstall both would be my recommendation. \n\n\n*\n\n*a vpn can send all traffic elsewhere so that has to be slower than letting you unfettered access to sites by the fastest route. \n\n*Mac security software generally opens you up to more vulnerabilities then they patch and slow you down as well. \n\n", "Q: Why can other users see my files in MY user folder? This is a screenshot of my private folders/files inside my user folder, but seen from a different user on my MacBook. Several folders are basically openly accessable for everybody, even when created inside my very own /user space.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it like this ?\n\n*How can I prevent other users from accessing my files (unless i move them inside protected folders)\n\n\n\n\nA: This is because Finder creates new folder with default permissions set to 755, or rwxr-xr-x (I agree that's questionable behavior). This means that new folders in your home directory are readable (r) and executable (x) by both users not-only in the same group, but all users on the system.\nYou can lock down the access to just your user from Finder's Get Info dialog by removing the group access entry and setting the \"everyone\" entry to \"No Access\".\nAlternately, you can use Terminal to chmod your directories with chmod 700 ~/your_directory to accomplish the same thing.\n\nA: Get information on each folder and change the permissions at the bottom of the finder window. Make sure you are the owner and no groups or other owners can read the contents of the folders. The permissions should read “no access”\nWhy this happened could be many things, but locking it down is trivial with finder and also not hard at the command line. \n", "Q: Make light-grey text darker on Mac (white background) I have a MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra with a white desktop background. \nMy problem is that any light-grey text (e.g. the words \"Answers for your Apple questions\" under the Ask Different logo at top left) is so light I cannot read it.\nWhat can I do to make any light-grey text a darker color?\n\nA: Assuming I understand the question, the first thing I'd do is change your accessibility display settings. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Accessibility preference pane\n\n*Within the left-hand pane click the Display icon (it's usually the 4th one down)\n\n*Now to the right you'll see a number of checkboxes and sliders relating to accessibility display settings\n\n*Have a play with these to see if they improve the readability of light-grey text\n\n", "Q: Watch 4 buttons and certain features frequently go unresponsive Recently purchased my first Apple Watch (series 4) and I'm having some troubles. Apropos of nothing (so far as I can tell) the digital crown and side button go completely unresponsive. Double side button doesn't bring up apple pay, holding it down doesn't even bring up the power slider. Rotation on the crown seems to work fine but crown presses are also ignored.\nI actually need to take the watch off my wrist before it will let me turn it off which does seem to fix the other issues. If this were a rare circumstance it wouldn't bother me much but it's happening about once per day. Am I somehow putting it into some mode that deactivates the buttons? This seems like a pretty big flaw so I'm guessing that I'm missing something here.\n\nA: I'm going to assume there's no pattern to when this happens and it's totally random.\nMy first thought would be that it's a connection issue (remembering that your watch is designed to communicate with your iPhone). So I'd go through the process of unpairing and then restoring your Apple Watch to see if that resolves the issue. \nIMPORTANT: - Read through all of this answer before commencing the process so that you know what's involved.\nYou can un-pair your Apple Watch from the Watch itself or from your iPhone. Since you're having frequent unresponsiveness from your Watch, the following steps are for doing this from your iPhone.\nUn-pair and restore your Apple Watch\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone go to the Apple Watch app\n\n*Make sure you're on the My Watch screen\n\n*Tap on your watch name at the top of the screen\n\n*Tap on the info icon (i.e. the amber circle with an 'i in it)\n\n*Now select the red Un-pair Apple Watch option\n\n*You'll be prompted to confirm the un-pair process\n\n*If you have an e-sim activated with a mobile service, choose to keep your plan\n\n*Disable Activation Lock by entering your Apple ID password and tapping Un-pair\n\n*Your watch data will begin backing up to your iPhone\n\n*When complete, your watch will:\n\n\n*\n\n*be unpaired from your iPhone\n\n*be unpaired from any Bluetooth devices\n\n*no longer have any Apple Pay cards attached\n\n*have no passcode\n\n*be reset to Apple's factory settings\n\n\n*OPTIONAL: You may want to backup your iPhone as it's now the only place all of your Apple Watch data is stored\n\n*Switch on your Apple Watch\n\n*Put it on\n\n*Now make sure your iPhone is close to your Apple Watch\n\n*Once the \"Use your iPhone to set up this Apple Watch\" prompt appears, tap on Continue. (NOTE: If the prompt doesn't appear, open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and tap the Start Pairing option)\n\n*Follow the prompts to pair your Watch to your iPhone and to set it up\n\n\nNow start using your watch again to see if it works properly. If it doesn't I'd call Apple Support. They can actually run diagnostics on your Apple Watch remotely (you will need to have your iPhone with you as well in order for them to do this). It doesn't take long to do and will help identify if there are any hardware issues.\n", "Q: Can AppleScript execute a Python script? As a math grad student I often have undergrads emailing me homework to be graded. Some undergrads do send me homework in PDF format. On the other hand many don't and it is very tiresome to convert their homework in image files into PDFs manually either online or using my simple Python script using img2pdf.\nI would like to be able to \n\n\n*\n\n*automatically download attachments that look like homework (i.e. the email has \"HW\", \"Homework\", \"hw\" or \"Hw\", \n\n*and there exists images or PDFs as attachments) \n\n*and then if images are obtained combine them into a single PDF using the Python script that I already have.\n\n*Adding a new option in the Mail app that can convert attachments to PDF using my Python script will also be great.\nI think AppleScript can handle the issue of saving attachments. Can it also execute a Python script?\n\nA: To answer the question actually in your post (as opposed to the current question title), yes it's possible to execute a python script from within AppleScript.\nHowever, you need to ensure you're not trying to run the script directly. Your AppleScript needs to use Python to run your script. \nExample\nAssuming your Python script is called img2pdf.py, you need to pass the path of your script as an argument from AppleScript to Python. Below is example code to show how you would do this if your script was saved in your Documents folder: \ndo shell script \"python /Users/yourusername/Documents/img2pdf.py\"\n\nBut, as I mentioned in my earlier comment, I would just make your requirements clear in advance (and include them in any assignment/essay/homework criteria) so your students know what they need to submit and how. My kids have to do this type of thing for their assessments, so I don’t think it’s too much for you to ask. Plus that’d make your job a lot easier! :)\n\nA: This is what Automator Services are for.

I've got a MacBook Air 2013 running 10.14, and loading all pages either stalls for multiple seconds on \"Resolving host\" and only loads after a painful delay or it completely fails and Chrome shows me a \"Could not resolve DNS error.\" This is consistent across browsers, so I'm inclined to believe this is an OS issue. \nWhat's throwing me for a loop is: this only happens on one network! The router has a 2.4Ghz and a 5Ghz network, and they both have this problem. The only way I can use the internet without tearing my hair out is to tether to my phone. \nAny ideas? Maybe I have a forgotten DNS setup that only fails on this router/ISP combo and I need to reset my DNS settings? \n\nA: Thanks for all the suggestions. I verified that this is indeed only a problem on this machine, so I figured it must be something misconfigured. \nI found that I had Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 (and associated backup and IPV6 addresses) as manually-set DNS servers for only this network. When I removed these addresses, my lookups became blazingly fast. \nThe mystery is now: why is 1.1.1.1 so slow? I set these as my DNS servers on my iPhone and it's nice and fast.

I have an external keyboard with a numeric keyboard which I never use. Is it possible to assign functions to those keys like:\n- opens Voice dictation\n* emulates Shift-Command-4\n+ emulates Tab-Command\n0 emulates Shift-Tab-Command\n\nA: You can assign key commands specifically to a numpad/10-key, as macOS differentiates between the 10-key numpad & the numbers above qwerty.  \nUntil [I think] Mojave, all key commands must have a modifier to call them, so you couldn't specify only a single number.\nThis has recently changed & you can now assign a single numpad key to a key command. You still cannot do this with the qwerty numbers.\nFor instance, here I use  Ctrl ⌃   [10-key]  to switch between Spaces & the OS is aware that using the same key combination on the 'qwerty' numbers doesn't call that switch.\nYou cannot tell by looking at the commands, they look the same, but they are considered different by the OS itself...\nJust to demonstrate, I changed my 'Switch to Desktop 1' command to just be numpad 1 & I can confirm this works as expected. Trying to assign only a single key from the qwerty section is not accepted.\n\nHowever, unless you want to use some 3rd party structure like Karabiner [with which I have no experience] then you can only call items which either already have an entry in the shortcuts structure, or that have a matching menu command.\nSo, you can assign a single key to activate Dictation, as that has an entry in the Keyboard prefs, you could add * as your shortcut to take a screenshot for the same reason, but you couldn't directly assign\n Cmd ⌘   Tab ⇥   to another key.\n", "Q: Installed Mojave, then my mac couldn't start the next day, now it asks to install Mojave again From High Sierra, I was prompted to upgrade to Mojave; did that, successfully completed (I guess, no errors were reported or something, but I don't remember if I restarted my laptop at that point. Moreover I didn't check if the version was upgraded in \"About this Mac\".).\nNext day, I try to start my laptop, nothing... Eventually it says there was a problem finding the launcher or something.

The purpose is to increase the primary OS partition (need some more space for the OS)\nI have tried disk Utilities but seem there is no operation support the above desire yet. Any suggestion? Thanks.\n\nA: Apple does not provide a way to add the space occupied by disk0s4 to disk0s2. To enlarge disk0s2 there must be significant free space directly below the partition. In your case, disk0s3 is below disk0s2 which blocks the possibility of enlarging disk0s2.\nYou could backup the contents of disk0s2. There does not appear to be enough space anywhere on disk0 to do this. You would have to find addition storage such as a external drive. Once the contents of disk0s2 is backed up, you could remove both disk0s2 and disk0s3. Next, you could enlarge disk0s2 to occupy all the newly create free space. Finally, you could recreate the \"Data\" volume by either adding a new volume to the APFS container or shrinking disk0s2 while creating a new disk0s3. You could then restore the contents of the \"Data\" volume from the backup.\nI should note that when I stated there was not enough space to backup disk0s2, I did not consider a compress backup of this partition. You could consider trying to make a backup in the form of a dmg file by using the Disk Utility application.\n\nA: There are some issues here:\n\n*\n\n*APFS file system;\n\n*Encrypted startup drive.\n\nI suggest you get an external drive and backup your drive. I suggest using CCC. You may need to un-encrypt your startup drive. Two external backups are best.\nThe easiest way would be to get an external drive and copy all the data to the external drive. Reformat you internal drive. Copy data back to original drive. For the startup partition, you will need to use a backup utility.\nCarbon Copy Cloner (CCC):\n\nClone, synchronize, backup. Schedule and forget it.\n\nSuperDuper:\n\nSuperDuper is the wildly acclaimed program that makes recovery painless, because it makes creating a fully bootable backup painless.\n\nYou can use Disk Utility to do the copy too. But, that's some assembly required, since I do not know how to do this.\nAnother way would be to buy a partition manager:\n\n*\n\n*Delete the backup partition;\n\n*Resize the data partition;\n\n*Move the data partition or insert a partition between your startup drive and your data partition;\n\n*Delete the splitter partition;\n\n*Use disk utility to expand your startup drive.\n\nI didn't see that a third party partition manager supported APFS.

I was under the impression that macOS is closed source. But this opensource domain says otherwise. Is macOS open source or partially open source? I'm confused now.\n\nA: Cross-site duplicate: Super User: Is Mac OS X open source?\n\nDarwin is open source operation system from Apple and it's core of Mac\n  OS X. But Darwin hasn't Mac OS X GUI.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Darwin is like Linux, FreeBSD, etc...\n  \n*Mac OS X GUI is like KDE, GNome, etc...\n\n\nA: It is more accurate to say that macOS, for the most part, is based on open source code.\nThere is a ton of open source technologies used in macOS from the core of the kernel to how it renders graphics to even Applications (like Chess).\nThey even have a number of Open Source Projects that are available to the community.\nFolks generally assume that \"Open Source\" means you have access to the code and you should be able to download it and hack away to your heart's content (i.e. RedHat/CentOS Linux).  That's not always the case.\nIt's all about the license\nIt comes down to licensing and there are basically three types:\n\n*\n\n*GPLv3 (Current version of GNU Public Licensing, implemented in late 2005)\n\n*GPLv2 (GNU Public Licensing)\n\n*BSD (Berkley Software Distribution)\n\nThe general difference between them is that GPL says \"you get, you give\" where as the BSD license says \"take and do whatever.\"  FOSSWire has further reading on this.  GPLv2 was a \"loose\" license similar to that of BSD\nIf you've noticed, everything in macOS is under the BSD or the older GPLv2 license .  This means they can take the code, incorporate it into their proprietary product (macOS) and not have to give back a single line of code, explain their changes, or reciprocate any rights back.\nFor instance, Bash, which is included with macOS is \"stuck\" at version 3.2.57 from 2007.\n$ bash --version\nbash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\nVersion 3.2 was the last version to be covered under the less restrictive GPLv2.  Bash 4.0 went to the more restrictive GPLv3. (This is also why you don't see Bash even included with FreeBSD and must be installed by the end user).\nCan you update Bash to a newer version?  Sure.  Apple just can't (and won't) distribute macOS with it due to the license restrictions.\nBut Darwin is open source.\nYes it is.  But Darwin is not macOS; it's the core of macOS.  It's the command line without the GUI.

It has a second level of load balancers that handle the transition to \"buy\" anything and once that transaction happens, then your account will go initiate the request to download a purchased asset.\nLots of things can go wrong and usually it's with the network or one of the servers behind the load balancer that's stuck and the load balancer doesn't know that it's broken and route around that one failure on one server.\nPractically, you can and should wait as a first step.

Find that app in purchased and move it to trash. The App Store should change from telling you it can open that app to it can download that app pithing a few seconds of moving that app to Trash. If you attempt to re-download it, the console app will log hundreds of diagnostic messages to the logs.\nAs long as you see TLS Events you'll know that secure communications from your App Store App to Apple's load balancers is being attempted.\n\n", "Q: Mojave made my MacBook impossibly slow I have a MacBook Air 11', Early 2014 with a 1,4GHz CPU and 4Gb of RAM.

Is there anything I can do about it?\nOr is my MacBook simply too slow to run Mojave decently? Apple lists it among the devices supported by Mojave. I'm interested in the experience of other users of the same model.\n\nA: I would advise using Activity Monitor to examine the CPU usage of the running processes. There's most likely a process taking up huge amounts of CPU-time responsible for slowing down the rest of the system.\nWhen you have identified the process, decide whether to remove the program, look for updates, contacting the developer or otherwise rectify the issue.\nNote: Right after installing Mojave the system will be slower than usually because it is creating Spotlight indexes, caches, and other types of one-off computations.

I repaired Safari by deleting MobileDevice.Framework, but iPhoto still won't open. Any thoughts?\n(I'm not ready to migrate to photos)\nUPDATE\nthey /just/ pushed an iTunes update that patched it. DERP. Fixed\n\nA: Based on the error message, it sounds like MobileDevice.Framework is necessary for iPhoto (probably because of its ability to pull photos from a mobile device.) I'm inclined to believe that since it's crashing at launch, this library needs to be loaded at start time. While it might be possible to maintain two different versions in a separate location, figuring out how to point each application to the right version really doesn't seem like the best idea to me. My recommendation would be one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update macOS and...\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to Photos (IMO it's actually much better than iPhoto.)\n\n*Continue to use iPhoto. Though it won't launch normally, if you right click it, hit \"Show Package Contents\" and navigate to Contents/MacOS/iPhoto and double click, it should launch.\n\n\n*Downgrade iTunes and restore your library from a backup (either Time Machine/whatever backup service you use, or the automatic backups iTunes creates when upgrading) or simply reimport your music.\n\n*Wait and see if Apple releases a new version of iTunes without this issue.\n\n", "Q: El Capitan and old Photoshop to bootable partition I have a working copy of Photoshop CS3 on a 2011 MacBook Pro. I would like to put it and an older OS on a bootable partition so I can use the CS3 occasionally and not have to pay monthly fees to Adobe. I am getting a new Mac soon, probably a MacBook Pro, and will want to use the partition with it since the CS3 will not run with newer systems.\nI have the DVD's for CS3 and an install DVD for OS 10.5 from the 2011 machine. How do I make sure it is bootable and this system works? Can I use Time Machine to move the CS3 from the 2011 machine or should I use the install disk? Since the OS disk came with a specific laptop, will it work with a new machine as a bootable partition?\n\nA: Macs very rarely support booting versions of macOS older than the one they shipped with—exceptions are few and far between, and never more than a year's release. This means that, at least on a new machine, partitioning and installing an older version on bare metal is out of the question.\nThough CS3 does support Intel Macs without Rosetta, and in theory, the binaries should launch on modern versions of macOS, compatibility with newer versions is... mediocre... at best. There's some info floating around about it, but nothing is really guarenteed to work.\nAs it stands, your options are basically as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to get CS3 (or if you want to up your odds, CS6) to work on a modern version of macOS\n\n*Continue using your old MacBook Pro (or another Mac) exclusively for CS3\n\n*Run an older version of macOS in a VM and deal with the potential slowdowns/issues associated with it (macOS isn't usually the happiest about running in a VM compared to other OSs.)\n\n*Use a Photoshop alternative (e.g. Affinity Photo, Pixelmator, etc.)\n\n*Bite the bullet and pay for CC\n\n\nI understand that none of these options are really that great; it's something I've struggled with too, personally. However, Adobe gives no other option really.\n\nA: Just another answer to add to the list of options.\nYou could install a Virtual Machine on your new Mac with the appropriate version of macOS and Adobe Photoshop. In terms of virtual machines you have both free and paid options, the best of which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox (free)\n\n*Parallels Desktop Lite\n\n*Parallels Desktop (paid)\n\n*VMware (paid)\n\n\nWhen visiting the above pages the focus is primarily on running Windows on your Mac, but many people use virtual machines to install other versions of macOS as well. This is perfectly okay with Apple so long as the hardware itself is a Mac. In your case you'd be installing an older version of macOS on a virtual machine on your new Mac, and therefore this will not be breaching the software license agreement.\nIn summary, you would create a Mac virtual machine, install the old version of Mac OS X onto that, and then install Photoshop CS3 etc within that. Then, whenever you wanted to use the software, you would just launch the virtual machine.\nIf you've never used a virtual machine before, I'd probably recommend you try Parallels Desktop Lite as that will probably be easier to set up than VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Safari - How to search on a web page from the current selection onwards Most browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox will search a we page from the current selection onward. It seems Safari does not support this.\nInstead it searches from the beginning of the webpage.\nHow can I change this behaviour?\n\nA: You can easily search from the point of selection using the following approach.\nImmediately after selecting the string to search, use the keyboard shortcut Command + E to record the search string into find buffer.\nNow press the keyboard shortcut Command + G to search from the selection point in the forward direction. To search backward, use the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + G.\nThis works in most other apps apart from Safari.\n", "Q: Do I need to renew the Institutional Recovery Key certificate with FileVault We plan to roll out FileVault via Apple's own MDM (Server.app).

I'm using my Mac Mini as a TimeMachine host. I have a couple of external drives plugged in via USB. TimeMachine doesn't work unless I use Finder to manually Browse the network and mount the volume after each reboot or Wifi change (e.g. when I've taken the MacBook on a work trip).\nIs there a way to have macOS or a script on my MBP to automagically mount the volume on the Mac Mini? Maybe something that checks every 30 minutes and remounts if it is not already?\nEdit: I have two home Wifis - one super-fast 4G with limited bandwidth, and the default one backed by ADSL, so I switch to the 4G one when I need to videoconference, and back to the default one to use the printer or connect to other devices at home.\n\nA: The way to mount the drives on the Client at login is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the Network Share.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Users & Groups.\n\n*Drag the drive's icon and drop it onto the list of Login Items for your user.\n\n\nWiFi change?

When I mute the iPad with the buttons on the side, the iPad is still playing the music quietly. This is really annoying and I would like to turn the sound completely off. Is there a solution to this? \n\nA: If you are on iOS 12, swipe from the top-right of the screen to get to control centre. \nThen make sure you slide the volume down:\n\n\nA: iOS has alert volume, media volume, and a nasty bug.\nBy default, the physical volume buttons adjust the alert volume, and media volume can be adjusted in Control Centre opened by swiping down from the top-right of the display.\nTo use the volume buttons to adjust alert volume when no media is playing, and media volume when media is playing, go to Settings → Sounds → Change with Buttons.\nIf the volume is off but you can still hear media playing, this is a bug with iOS. If the media is playing full screen, you can mute the media with the volume button on the top-right of the media.\n", "Q: Truncated transfer of Time Machine backup contents to new flash drive I'm trying to transfer a 60GB folder from a Time Machine backup of a dead MBP to my 128GB USB-C flash drive (ExFAT). Unfortunately, whenever the transfer is almost complete, an alert informs me that my flash drive is 'full' and then truncates the transfer. This is weird, because my flash drive is newly formatted (no .trashes), and the size of the folder to be transferred is clearly much smaller than the maximum capacity of the flash drive. The folder ends up being only partially transferred. Furthermore, I start having trouble mounting the flash drive after the truncated transfer; the drive only mounts after I kill fsck.\nAll of the sub-folders of my 60GB folder can be transferred out individually – quickly and without any problems – except for one folder (projects). This folder contains ~400,000 items, primarily in node_modules folders. I believe that the large number of items might be causing the transfer to fail, but I can't figure out why.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What am I doing wrong and how should I go about transferring my folders?\n\n*Why does my newly formatted 128GB flash drive show that it is full when it only contains a 60GB folder? Does this have anything to do with the large number of files?\n\n\nA: Time Machine uses hard links to link to multiple copies of the exact same data. Hard links are one of many features that exFAT does not support.\nIf you were to copy multiple files that link to the same data to an exFAT drive, it would be duplicated for each hard link, potentially making the resulting copy much larger than the original.\nTo avoid these problems, you should probably only ever copy Time Machine backups to an HFS+ or APFS drive. If reformatting the external drive is not an option, you might consider creating a disk image of the backup directory and save it to the external drive (via Disk Utility or the command line).\n", "Q: How to delete partially downloaded updates in High Sierra? I'm trying to update my Macbook Pro to the latest security update for High Sierra but the download doesn't seem to finish and is working in a really weird way. I tried to cancel the current update, and it does cancel, but when I try to start it again, it doesn't start from the very beginning and shows an entirely different progress than what it showed before I cancelled it. For instance, I cancelled the download at around 700mb, but when I tried up update again, it shows that only 300mb has been downloaded.\nI want to start the download from the start, from 0%, which I think will fix the issue but I can't seem to do that, too.

When I tried to start again, it started at around 738mb.\n\nA: Sorry, but I only have a partial answer to your question:\nFirst off I would try a different approach and download from here: https://support.apple.com/downloads \nAlso a safe boot (pressing and holding the shift button at boot until the Apple symbol appears) with an installation attempt there often succeeds.\nAs far as I know High Sierra downloads tmp system updates to a file, or files similar to this: /private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000s0000068/C/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/CFNetworkDownload_XxxXxX.tmp \n...then assembles them into a subdirectory, within...\n/private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000s0000068/C/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate/swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/...before moving them to... /Library/Updates/. \nYou can always boot into \"Recovery\", which should let you browse all directories in Terminal (to be found under the \"Utilities\" menu). \n\nA: This seems to be due to an interrupted or corrupted download. This can usually be resolved by clearing your Mac App Store cache.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Mac App Store\n\n*Go to Terminal and type following: open $TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore/\n\n*Move the files inside the folder to the Desktop or any temporary location (if you are confident, you can move them to Trash straight away.)\n\n\nThis should resolve the problem as temp files are cleared. For more information, read http://osxdaily.com/2016/10/08/mac-app-store-temp-cache-folder/.\nIf it is still not working, locate the folder /private/var/folders and open each subfolder inside it until you find com.apple.appstore.

On my iPhone I use Safari to log into my twitter account (I don't have the app on my phone). When I'm done I log out of twitter, so I'm very often using Safari's password saving ability. \nI also use 1Password to save passwords (mostly these days because of its password generator). For work I had a set of passwords saved in a vault (1Password term) including multiple work twitter accounts. I've moved on to a different company and deleted that vault from 1Password. However Safari still lists those two twitter accounts in the list of possible logins to twitter when I go to the login page. \nI deleted them from Keychain Access (on my Mac), and then searched on my phone (I'm guessing this was back when I was using iOS 11, because when I went to look for passwords under Settings > Safari just now it's not there anymore, it has its own list item in iOS 12) and did not find them. \niOS is definitely not still obtaining the passwords from 1Password. I've actually bought a new phone since deleting the work vault from 1Password.\nHow can I  remove these usernames/passwords from my phone?\nRelated, but I'm willing to break this into a separate question if needed:\nMy bank website (on my Mac) also has an incorrect (old) username (no password) that autofills as soon as the page loads. I have to click the username field and select my correct username. This isn't as difficult because the UI is a little smoother, but it seems like there is some kind of login cache that I can't erase. I have removed this username from Keychain Access and it still shows up. \n\nA: There are a few possibilities of where the passwords are being saved.  To clarify, do you know if you are using iCloud Keychain on your devices?  Keychain Access works in collaboration with iCloud Keychain, which allows you to share keychains with your other devices.  So it's possible they are syncing between devices via your Apple ID if you are signed in and have enabled that feature.\nYou can check the saved passwords on iOS as mentioned in ankiiiiiii's post.  By going to settings, Accounts & Passwords, the looking under App & Website Passwords.\nOn your Mac with OS X Mavericks 10.9 or later with Safari open, Choose Safari, Preferences, then click on Passwords.

Where are you copying the pictures from?  You can use the share icon in other apps like Safari, Mail, Messages, etc. to save directly to Photos instead of copying, then pasting in notes then using the share icon to save.\n\nA: Open Messages, address a text to yourself, tap the input bar and paste the photo, then hold a finger over the photo and choose save to save it to the camera roll.\n", "Q: MacBook Unidentified Sound My MacBook started making a weird sound a few weeks ago. It happens about every 10 minutes, and I don't know what is causing it. It's not the hardware. I know because if my computer is on mute, then I can't hear it. Here is a link to a video that plays the sound: ﻿https://youtu.be/nCEbk7zI3cs\nI'm on a 2017 MacBook Pro running High Sierra.\nHow can I get this sound to go away?\n\nA: I updated my OS version to Mojave, and it went away.

Camera shows up fine under system report. The machine has never been opened. \nMachine is a MacBook Air 2012 running High Sierra (latest version).\nFinally, note that this may have started when I changed the system's language.\n\nA: Test it using a new account (create one) or (after making a backup) on a fresh install. If that doesn’t work, the camera is defective. The USB interface and power indicator can still work with a broken video module, so the green light does not always indicate a working camera.\n\nA: The camera has failed.\nIt's not an expensive part, but you have to disassemble the entire LCD display assembly to remove it.  Since the assembly is glued together, it makes replacing this part extremely difficult.\nTherefore, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*replace the entire display assembly\n\n*get a USB web cam\n\n\n(IMO) given the age of this laptop and the expense and difficultly of the repair, I would go with the second option.\n\nA: \n\nI spent hours debugging this on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running Catalina. The camera did not work in any app.\nI tried restarting, zapping PRAM, resetting SMC. In System Preferences, I checked permissions in Security & Privacy > Privacy > Camera.\nIn About This Mac > System Report…, the camera shows up correctly in Hardware: Camera.\nI discovered that the camera did work in another user account, so it was not a hardware problem.\nLong story short, I figured out that Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions were inadvertently turned on, with Apps > Allow: Camera being disabled. I had turned on restrictions on an old iPhone; these settings are apparently shared across devices for the same iCloud account.\n", "Q: how can I put a macron over the letter \"m\" in MS Word?

In iOS 12 clock app, you can control whether each alarm vibrates. In the timer section, you cannot control whether the timer vibrates.\nThis question has already been asked here:\nHow to disable vibration for Timer alerts?\nHowever, iOS has changed so that the workaround of disabling vibrations on alarms no longer disables vibrations on timers... due to the fact that you can no longer disable vibration on all alarms but control each alarm individually.\nI do not want to disable all vibrations with the mute button. Is there a way to control specifically how the timer behaves?\n\nA: The only way to achieve this functionality is having no sound when the timer finishes.\nGo to Clock -> Timer -> When Timer Ends -> Stop Playing\n\n", "Q: How can I get my 13\" MacBook Pro to detect the NVMe m.2 drive that I installed? Today I installed a Samsung 970 Evo 1TB on my 13\" mid 2014 MacBook Pro. I used an adapter that is not the small sintech one that everyone else seems to be using but is a different sintech similar one with a full length pcb.\n\n\nOnce I went into the system recovery mode (Command + R), and went into Disk Utility to detect and recover my backup onto the new SSD, but it didn't show up.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moving SSD around in adapter.\n\n*Moving the adapter around.\n\n*Adjusting both connections.\n\n*Using the Apple provided screw and different combinations of pressure.\nI might be, but hopefully didn't, mess up the adapter choice or installed it wrong, but I just want to fix soon to dual boot since I only have 128 GB.\n\nA: Make sure in disk utility you have shown all disks/drives/volumes and not just volumes as is the default view.... A bare unformatted drive is usually not shown especially in High Sierra+ where they introduced APFS because of the new file structure. Click on the gear or down arrow and show all devices in the left side are of disk utility and see if you can then see the nvme, click on the very root of the drive not a volume and format it to apfs. If you don't see it to do this, then you have a bad adapter probably and should buy the one that's most recommended. Nvme support isn't as great as I'd hoped on my 2014 MBP either. I fixed the slow to restart and sleep issue but the system still doesn't recognize it at boot for almost 20 seconds (even after selecting it as the startup disk as many have suggested, that didn't help a thing for me) it simply takes several seconds to see it unless I boot and hold option key and then select it which is much faster to show it but still a pain to have to do. I actually pulled mine and use it in my m. 2 slot on my Windows Z390 Mobo instead as I restart and or sleep the Mac alot in my work (I'm in and out of car a lot) so it really wasn't practical for me. But try showing all devices in the left pane.... It should be there if you don't have a bad adapter. \nthe attached is what you want to see in order to do the proper formatting etc.\n\n\nA: you will need to set it up with high Sierra 10.13.6 and it will recognize it\n\nA: I'll share my experience. There was an update issue with my Macbook Pro 2015 (Mid) and the NVME drive was suddenly dead. Hence I purchased a new one along with the PCI-E X2 to M.2 Converter. Initially at Startup internet recovery ( Command + R ) was not showing up the NVME SSD once after using an SSD Enclosure and initializing/Formatting it to APFS as well. Then I created a bootable USB Monterey and booted it as the startup disk and it worked.\nThanks to all the above people.\n", "Q: MIgration Assistant from HFS+ (case sensitive) to APFS (case sensitive) I have a new 2018 MacBook Pro, OS X Mojave 10.14.2, hard drive formatted as AFPS (Case-sensitive) and an old 2009 MacBook Pro, OS X Yosemite, hard drive formatted as HFS+ (Case-sensitive, Journaled).  I believe OS X on the old laptop cannot be upgraded any further.\nI am attempting to use Migration Assistant to move the files over from the one user on the old laptop to the new one.  When I get to the \"Transfer Information to This Mac\" step of OS X install on the new laptop, I fire up Migration Assistant on the old, and see it appear on the new as a transfer source, but with a yellow caution icon.  Selecting that icon displays a pop-up with the message:\n**The selected source cannot be used for migration.**\nThis source is not using a Case Sensitive filesystem, while your Mac is.\n\nI have confirmed in Disk Utility and About This Mac that both hard disks are formatted case-sensitive.  There is a big difference in that the old drive is formatted HFS+, and the new AFPS.\nInitially, I was able to use migration assistant to transfer the files, up until I discovered that the new drive was not formatted case-sensitive, which of course caused problems with filenames that differ only by case.  So I used command-r to boot the new system into recovery mode, formatted that drive as AFPS case-sensitive, and reinstalled OS X Mojave, only to run into this issue.\nSo, how do I get the user and all their files from the old laptop to the new?\n\nA: I was able to restore from a time machine backup.  Just had to manually do a up-to-date backup on the old laptop.\nStill don't know why I was unable to do a system-to-system (both with case-sensitive volumes) migration.\n\nA: I have a similar issue and what's even more weird is, that both systems are APFS (case sensitive). I get the same error as you.\nFor those planning to do a Mac-To-Mac trasnfer via Migration Assistant I would just steer clear from that - it simply doesn't work in these cases (ultimately I just grabbed an old hard disk, did a one-time fresh Backup and restored it on the new laptop using Migration Assistant).\n\nA: By default, both APFS and HFS+ volumes are \"case-aware\", but NOT case-sensitive. So the file system will save a file called \"MyBigTextFile.txt\", and retain the case as written. But it won't distinguish it from \"mybigtextfile.txt\", which will over-write it.\nChoosing a case-sensitive file system can cause problems and is not usually recommended, unless you have particular needs. Unless you specifically set your drive up to be case-sensitive, then it won't be. Some versions of Adobe apps don't work on sensitive volumes, for example.\nIf you are absolutely sure that both are case-sensitive, then it seems likely that the flagged error is either a bug, or some limitation of 'matching' files from one file system to the other.\nWas your TM backup also Case-sensitive? Presumably so, as the source and backup would need to match.\nAlso, your 2009 should be able to run El Capitan, 10.11.\n", "Q: Unexpected Safari Extension -- Download Video After a very recent install-from-scratch of Mojave, I was installing a Safari extension and noticed one already there called \"Download Video\". \n\nIt claims to be version 1.0.0 and that it \"Downloads video from a webpage\". It was not active (i.e. its box in the Extensions manager was unchecked) but I've no idea how it got there. I certainly didn't knowingly do it myself\nI did notice one other inactive extension -- \"Open in Internet Explorer\" -- that I also did not explicitly install myself. However, it says it came as part of Parallels Desktop and I did install that. So that leads me to conclude that the installation of certain apps may also involve installation of Safari extensions. And I certainly have installed some apps since after my clean Mojave install, so maybe the Download Video thing piggy-backed in off one of those? But most of what I've installed is fairly well-known, standard stuff -- MS Office, Emacs, and the like. Nothing I'd expect to have a sneaky video downloader hanging off it. \nAny idea where in could have come from?\nSafari 12.0.2\nMojave 10.14.2\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\nA: If I had to guess on what this was there would be two things that I would guess that it might be:\nAdware\n\n\n*\n\n*You might have accidentally installed a package somewhere that installed this as an option in the installer, and this would install adware that could change your default search browser. The person who made the extension might have messed up and not made it so that it didn't activate it. \n\n\nReal youtube downloader\n\n\n*\n\n*At one point you might have installed a browser extension if you wanted to download a youtube video. These are everywhere and since youtube does not have a built in free system to download the videos officially, there are a ton of different 3rd party plugins that people have developed and this might be one. If you can remember that you installed it then you shouldn't worry.\n\n\nEither way, I would uninstall it if you don't use it anymore as it could be anything\n\nA: Turns out, as per commented suggestion by James Singhal, it's a browser extension associated with a component of Parallels Toolbox. Details are here. So overall not the sneaky malware I wondered that it might be. \nNow I can't be 100% sure that I wasn't asked a generic \"do you want us to install browser extensions\" question when Toolbox was being installed (even it was a mere side effect of the thing I actually was consciously installing -- Parallels Desktop itself), but I'm 99% sure of it. So for that I guess I'll grant Parallels one slap on the wrist. These malware-fraught days, they really should know better than to drive-by install a piece of software -- without even a sign of provenance -- even if they at least had the grace not to activate it.\nAnyway, back down to DEFCON 5. As you were.\nP.S. FWIW, I figured this out by trying to uninstall the thing. I was told I'd have to do that by uninstalling its associated app, and when I accepted the offer to see where that app was in Finder, it was revealed that it was in the Parallel Toolbox.app package. A quick Google led me to the emails pointed to by the above link.\n", "Q: My car no longer recognizes media on my iPhone 7 I recently switched to Spotify after using the Apple Music app. My car was able to recognize the song name and time, etc.\nAfter I switched to Spotify and deleted Music, my car doesn't recognize anything anymore -- it just plays the music without any information.

In macOS Mojave, whenever you take a screenshot a small preview thumbnail will appear at the bottom-right of your screen, and then it will go away on its own.\nI have noticed that the .PNG screenshot file will be written to your Desktop after the thumbnail flies away, rather than instantaneously like it used to be.\nThis may sound ridiculous but as a very extensive user of the screenshot features, this lag is rather annoying.\nThe closest solution I have found is that if you manually swipe the thumbnail to the right, your screenshot will be written a bit earlier.\nIs it possible to configure the screenshots behavior to write the file immediately? I don't mind deactivating the thumbnail preview - I just want to have the file sitting on my Desktop as soon as possible.\nI am running macOS Mojave 10.14.2.\n\nA: You can take screenshots instantly by turning off the thumbnail preview.\nThis can be achieved by opening the screenshot utility and uncheck the \"Show Floating Thumbnail\" button.\n\n(3rd last option from below)\nThe options also allow you to set a timer for taking screenshots.\n\nA: \nCan I have my screenshot files written immediately in Mojave?\n\nYes.\nSimply use the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + 5 to open new screenshot utility. Now under Options, uncheck Show Floating Thumbnail item.\n\nYou can also customize the default location for saving the screenshot or can choose to copy it directly to clipboard.\n", "Q: Change iPhone language from Chinese to English I bought a second hand iPhone 4, and I cannot create an Apple ID since the language appearing is Chinese.

Until I rebooted. \nI forgot to change the backup drive's network settings. So when I boot off of the backup drive, the computer is live on the internet with an IP of 172.16.0.7. No bueno. \nI was able to get the server booted back up off of the primary drive, so I'm in service for now. But I have no physical access to this machine. What I need is:\nA way to change the IP address of both ethernet interfaces, on the Backup hard drive, while I am booted up off of the Primary hard drive. If I'm lucky, there's a .plist somewhere I can edit and life will be good. If I'm unlucky, Apple will have some truly insane way of storing IP settings, and it won't be possible to do this at all. \nNote: This is an El Capitan install. \n\nA: Network configuration information is stored in\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n\nTo change the manual IP address assignment, change the string value at\nNetworkServices:GUID:IPv4:Addresses:0\nTo find the right GUID, see the UserDefinedName value for each service.\nIf ConfigMethod is set to DCHP, the Addresses array is ignored.

It's setup with both an Institutional Recovery Key (IRK) and a Personal Recovery Key (PRK). The last one is also saved to MDM.\nBasically, we generated a keychain like this, exported the certificate from the keychain, and added it to an MDM profile (we're using Server.app's MDM).\nIt's working great. When I do a diskutil apfs listCryptoUsers diskNxM, I get all the users I expect, including an user of type Institutional Recovery User and one with type Institutional Recovery External Key. Resetting password via Open Directory works fine. Unlocking the drive with the PRK works fine. \nAnd now I'm testing to unlock the volume with the said IRK.\nI booted via Recovery (cmd+R), and when I execute diskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/diskNsM -recoveryKeyChain /Volumes/RecoveryDrive/FileVaultMaster.keychain (the keychain is unlocked, and the drive is correct), I get this error:\nError unlocking APFS Volume: The external-to-APFS security system's credential-unwrap\noperation failed (-69534)\n\nI checked unlocking the keychain using a different password, and that failed directly. Someone here suggested to remove the certificate from the keychain. This didn't work either. I double checked the volume was APFS.

I started off with a keychain with a certificate and private key that I could unlock, and an MDM profile with the exported certificate.\nBecause I couldn't find another solution, I created a new Keychain. I used this Apple Support Document. I didn't remove the private key, because I deploy it by exporting the certificate, and distributing it via MDM.\nHowever, I did use the \"Use the private key to unlock a user's startup disk\" procedure from this document to unlock the volume and it worked! \nSo this is not an actual answer to the asked question, but certainly a solution. I double checked the computer encrypted with the old keychain certificate with this procedure, but got the same error message.

Apple Mail features a selector with small, medium and large options. see selector to the upper right of the image.\n\nThunderbird lets you click on the image then you can resize the image, but a smaller image doesn't reduce the file size.\nIf you are desperate for this functionality, you may be able to write an applescript to adjust the picture size. A lot of assembly required. \n", "Q: Unable to format SD card I was using my SD card on my phone. One fine day it showed a message that it was corrupted. I put the card in an adapter and plugged it into my iMac.\n\nI was able to read and copied all I need. I decided to format it anyway and used disk utility to do so. \n\nIt said that it had finished erasing, but all the files were still on it.\n\nI tried deleting each folder. But when I ejected and put it back in, the files are still there. I can't format it via my phone either and I am too scared to use the terminal for erasing. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: It's dead.\nSmash it to prevent your data being stolen & throw it away.\nIf a write error occurs, the firmware controller will switch over to read-only mode to prevent further data loss. This is to all intents & purposes, irreversible.\n", "Q: Can I charge a 2017 MacBook Pro with a third-party USB C power adaptor? I've got a 2017 MacBook Pro which comes stock with an 87W USB C Power Adapter.\nI want to purchase an additional power adapter, but I don't require an official Apple one. I notice that Anker make one with 60 W power output over USB C.\nOther than charging my laptop at about 2/3rds the speed of the Apple Power Adapter, (2/3rds = ca. 60/87 w), would there be any effect / damage on my machine?\n\nA: Imagine a water reservoir (battery) with water gushing out of a sluice (CPU usage), and a bucket (low-rated charger). You're putting water into the reservoir with the bucket, but it may not be equal to the rate of water coming out of the sluice. \nThe reservoir level will fall, but at a slower rate than if you weren't filling it with the bucket.\nThe Apple-supplied 87W charger has enough power to supply your laptop's power needs, even at max CPU, AND to charge the battery at the same time.\nA lower-rated charger cannot always supply enough power at the maximum rate that the laptop needs, and also charge the battery at the same time. It will recharge the battery fully when the lid is closed, and you're not using the laptop.\n\nA: I have a 13' MacBook Pro which has a 61W Power Adapter supplied by default. For this I have bought an Anker 30W rated charger with which I never ever had any issues charging the notebook (even when doing CPU intensive stuff), and I also have a cheap 15W (5Vx3A) charger in my car as well, which still slightly charges the notebook, unless I'm doing something CPU intensive. I sometimes also use my mobile phone charger rated 10W (5Vx2A) as well to charge my notebook, in that case it always discharges, but at a much slower rate than if I hadn't plugged it in at all. It can still charge the notebook if I leave it on overnight though.\nAlthough your notebook does have a higher power consumption by default, as it's the 15' variant, based on my experience with the smaller version I don't imagine using it with only a 60W charger will cause too many issues, even when you are really trying to push the computer to the limits. However please note that the one in your post (which is exactly the same as I have) is actually only 30W on the USB-C port - the other 30W is shared on the 4 plain USB ports. You might try to check the values in the About your Mac section as Buscar said to see your notebook's power consumption, especially if you do heavy CPU/GPU intensive tasks.\nNote: I've been using this setup for more than a year now without seeing any performance degradation of the batteries.\n\nA: The USB-C plug is not the problem, but the charger is.\nIt is underrated, so it will never manage to completely charge your battery while the Mac is in use, or supply enough when needed.\nWith that said, you can use it to charge battery overnight to use it during the day.\nTo verify it is best to take occasional look at the battery charge condition in \"System information\" (hold the \"option\" key and click on the apple symbol on the top left corner on the menu bar).\n\n\n*\n\n*This indicated value will be negative if charger is not plugged in or not sufficient.\n\n\n*It will be positive if charger is sufficient.\nNo damage to your Mac will occur in any case.\n\nA: Your Mac will be fine. It will charge slower. While it is working hard, the battery might even discharge slowly if 60 watt isn’t enough, but without the charger it would discharge a lot quicker. \nThe only problem is that the charger may not be built to run at 100% for long times. Anker has a good reputation, just don’t push that charger too hard. \n\nA: Sure. But using an Apple adapter is always recommended over 3rd party ones. Yes, Apple's adapters are expensive but they are of high quality and are the best for your MacBook.\n", "Q: How to put Magic Trackpad 2 into Discovery Mode I have a Magic Trackpad 2.  I previously had it paired with my Mac.  I then had it set up to work with another computer.  I now want to use it with my Mac again and it will not work.\nI have followed the suggestions in this question to no avail.\nI have tried resetting the Bluetooth module on my mac.  I have tried clearing all the connected devices from my mac.  The trackpad is fully charged.  It works when connected via a wire.  I've tried turning the trackpad on and off and that does not help.  My Mac just can not see it via Bluetooth.\nIs there a way to force the Magic Trackpad 2 into discovery mode?\n\nA: To setup a Magic Trackpad 2 you have to connect it to your Mac using the Lightning cable.\nConnect the Trackpad, make sure device's power is on, setup using Bluetooth section of System Preferences.\nHere is the Apple support article with the steps I described:\nSet up your Apple wireless mouse, keyboard, and trackpad\n", "Q: How to sync macOS with iCloud Drive? I've got MacBook where I used to have iCloud turned on to sync all my files (desktop & documents) and have them accessible from other devices. When I go to \"Files\" app on iOS, I can easily see and access those files. The same from icloud.com website.\nNow I've just got new MacBook. I've turned on iCloud Drive in Preferences (and checked Desktop & Documents Folders  in Options panel) but it doesn't download anything from iCloud, i.e. it doesn't sync files from iCloud Drive. It has only created new folders locally (Desktop & Documents).\nAlso, those two folders created on new Mac are not visible anywhere on iCloud Drive (neither through icloud.com nor Files app).\nIs this normal behavior? Or am I doing something wrong? How can I get those iCloud files on my Mac?\n\nA: Assuming you've logged into the same Apple ID in Apple > System Preferences > iCloud as you have on your other devices, you should be fine. Beyond this, you've already selected the correct options regarding iCloud Drive.\nConsidering this is a totally new MacBook, you will need to allow some time for everything to get synced, especially when there's multiple devices concerned and if there's larger amounts of data (not only in terms of file sizes, but also in terms of the actual number of files).\nAnother factor will be the speed of your internet connection. In the meantime, just make sure your MacBook is online and has a stable connection. I'd allow 24hrs in order to start seeing your files populate, keeping in mind that they may not all be there if you have a lot of data.\nFinally, if you do have a lot to sync, you can opt to not let your MacBook go to sleep during the initial sync period (i.e. allow your screen to go to sleep, but not your MacBook itself). In other words, select the Prevent Computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off option in Energy Saver preferences.\n\nA: I read on another board that Desktop and Documents are the only two folders that iCloud syncs, but that may only mean, \"out of the box.\"  There may be ways to tweak a more comprehensive sync. \nAs to applications that are specifically for this purpose, I only know of the venerable Chronosync, with which I'm about to sync my new Macbook Air with my older Macbook Pro.  (Thank goodness I bought 500GB SSDs for each!)\n", "Q: I tried activated the option to partition a disk, instead all my drive data disappeared in a few seconds I read online that there was a command line to activate the partition option on Disk Utility:\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk4 1 GPT HFS+ newdisk\n\nWhich is just supposed to unlock the possibility to partition THEN chose the partition size or erase. Instead it renamed the disk but it also made all my data disappear!!\nPlease tell me there's a way to retrieve it or I'm going to smash the Mac to pieces...\n\nA: diskutil partitionDisk command does exactly what you described happening.  Partitions a disk, removing all volumes.  All volumes on the disk you ran the command on are destroyed.  So you partitioned disk4 and renamed it newdisk using GPT HFS+.  I'm not sure where you got the command information from but the command you entered did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I would recommend looking into data recovery services if you need anything that was on that drive.\n", "Q: Macbook Startup Freeze I have a mid-2013 Macbook Air (A1466) that has been freezing/hanging during the startup process. It is running Mojave 10.14.2.\nThis issue first began when I attempted to wake the computer from sleep by opening the lid. Instead of the normal login screen, everything stayed black. I held down the power button to shut everything down, and have been stuck with this freezing issue ever since.\nI am usually able to type in my password and have a progress bar appear before it freezes about 1/3 of the way through. Occasionally it freezes immediately on the apple logo, other times it freezes at the login screen before I can type anything in.\nI have tried the following solutions with no luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the PRAM/NVRAM\n\n*resetting the SMC\n\n*booting in safe mode - freezes on progress bar\n\n*Diagnostics test - freezes on progress bar\n\n*Command-R - it freezes before the utility menu appears\n\n*Command-Option-R - it freezes before I can select a wifi network\nIn Verbose mode, it continues to freeze, although at different points. I've included a few pictures here since I have no idea what any of this stuff means.\nAlso relevant is that this is not the first time this has happened. I'm now running Mojave, but this issue occurred in High Sierra as well. In the past, I kept trying to login over the course of a few days and eventually was able to log in successfully. That was approximately 6 months ago, and everything was normal up until this latest incident.\nI know the battery is due to be replaced soon, though I'm not sure if that's important.\nAny insight into what could be causing this would be very appreciated! Thank you!\n\nA: \nThis issue first began when I attempted to wake the computer from\n  sleep by opening the lid.

I am a data analyst and would like to look at the underlying data that is the basis for the relatively simple screen time reports. I want to be able to look at my phone usage data in more detail and beyond the 7 day report period that is usually reported. \nHas anyone figured out how to access the data or create more in depth analyses?\n\nA: I am looking into this for quite some time already and I believe there is no option to do so as of now.\nHowever there are two ways I found to get around this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1 (without jailbreak):\nUse an App like Moment to track your phone usage and export the data via this app. My problem with this soultion is the fact that I potentially give away my data to the app's developer.\n\n*Option 2 (with jailbreak): I found this great resource that makes use of the data Apple collects anyways. The data still needs to be extracted via a script file and you still need to put some work in in order to process the outputs, but I think this is the safest bet. With this scripts you are able to extract a lot more than 'just' the phone usage.\n\n\nA: According to this discussion thread answered by Apple Community experts, there seems to be no official way of downloading your screen time data from iOS\n", "Q: Are blocked callers notified When you block a caller are they notified they are blocked?\n\nA: No the caller is not notified if you block a contact from an iOS menus and they try calling you. The call rings through normally on their side and would be routed to your voicemail.  A section in voicemail will appear that is called 'Blocked Messages' where any voicemails left by callers you have blocked are kept. \n", "Q: How to restore Mac without deleting files I must have run an \"rm -rf *\" command in my root file system (noob mistake I know) as all my files and apps on my mac were deleted, but the computer was still functioning. I've continued working on the mac, and noticed there is no /System/ folder, so I'm thinking maybe I deleted the system folder. Is there a way to restore the file system but keep the apps and files I'm working with?\n\nA: You can boot into macOS Recovery by pressing Cmd-R at startup, from there you can reinstall macOS. This should leave your files intact, it's nevertheless not a bad idea to do a backkup first.\nApple has described the procedure in detail in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314 and https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204904.\n", "Q: How can I resolve a situation in which my Mac keeps crashing while working with a specific video file? My MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar keeps having a kernel panic whenever I attempt to use a specific video file I recorded with my Atomos Shogun Flame. FCPX imports and uses all of the other files from the same shoot fine. However, if I try to play, create a proxy, or do anything that involves handling this file after import, my computer reboots.\nSo far I've attempted to re-encode the file using Adobe Media Encoder, but FCPX still has issues with it. I've tried importing the file into Adobe Premiere but the system still crashes (i.e. it freezes, turns off, then reboots). If I put my SSD back in the Atomos Shogun, and watch the entire file, it plays perfectly fine. \nI've also attempted transferring the file from the SSD to my internal drive, as well as to my RAID prior to importing it, but that causes the same issue. \nIs there a tool that I can use to fix this file so my computer won't crash while using it? Or is there something else I can try to get around this issue?\nThe Shogun Flame has limited file management capabilities, so I am unable to do anything on that end. I haven't purchased Apple Compressor, so Adobe Media Encoder is the primary tool I have to convert files.\n\nA: No-one here is going to be able to give you a 100% definitive answer on why a specific video file is causing a crash (especially without full details of the file in question and without access to it), except of course to say it's most likely corrupted in some way.\nSome things to try include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting your MBP into Safe Mode and trying to import the file again.\n\n*I know you've tried re-encoding the file using Adobe Media Encoder, but perhaps you could try encoding the file into a totally different format first. Ideally you would try doing this within the Atomos Shogun Flame directly, but I'm not familiar with that device and don't know what export/editing functions it has. If none, have you got any other software to try converting it?\n\n*Another thing to try would be to manually copy the file from the SD card onto another card/drive (or to your Mac) without going through an import process. If that succeeds, then try importing the file (or converting it into a new format) from the new location. \n\n*Open the file using Quicktime Player and, assuming it opens okay, use Quicktime's export function to export it (with a new filename). Then see if the newly exported file can be imported into FCP and edited fine.\n\n*Take a look at your FCP preferences to see if changing how it deals with situations like dropped frames will make a difference.\n", "Q: deleted select photos previously synced to my phone but not the whole folder How can I delete select photos from my iphone 8 that were previously synced from my computer but I can't find the folder on my computer, a microsoft tech guy helped me get photos from the Microsoft photos opp onto my phone after I dropped my iphone 7 and couldn't get the pics off of it.\n\nA: I would turn on iCloud sync of photos so you can use a computer to ohotos to be deleted or just delete them from a larger screen. \nFor me, using a computer via photos is even better, but you might not have a Mac but just about everyone can borrow a computer to organize things easier than tapping on an iPhone. \n", "Q: How to organise photos in Apple Ok I've just converted to a Mac from Windows and I am totally stumped by Apple iCloud and Apple Photos (Running Mojave 10.14.2) In Windows I had all my photos organised by date (eg filename 2018-12-20, y/m/d)then a description (ex: a photo of my 9 month old would be 2018-12-20 - Wallace 8 Months - Australia Zoo) but I can't figure out how to organise or change filenames on Mac.

I want to back up to an external hard drive but everything recent will all be jumble when I do with not being able to change the file names. Help please!!!\n\nA: Photos imported into Photos.app go into a large .photolibrary resource. You should consider it to be a black hole. You can't (and shouldn't) organize the the photos there in the Finder or rename them.\nHowever, Photos.app will automatically show you photos by date (among other sorting styles). Also by geolocation (e.g. Australia Zoo), Faces (e.g. Wallace), and more. Separate metadata for each of these is much more organized and useful than one filename which happens to include all the data.\nYou state in the comments that you have a 'control-freak' nature. Well, fighting Photos is only going to make things worse. Either use Photos as it is, or don't use it, and organize your Photos manually, or by using some other app.\n", "Q: How to show passwords in Keychain Access? Is there any setting that is supposed to cause the macOS Keychain Access app to show, in the password area, not the passwords themselves but instead random-looking capital alphanumeric characters?\nThis is what I'm seeing but I'd rather see the passwords. \nI'm not sure if this is a setting I don't know about or if something is broken. \n\nA: Okay, I figured out why this is happening, after reading this article and this answer.\nIf you have access to a WiFi network because at one point or another you or someone else explicitly shared the password with you using the \"Share Password\" feature on iOS 11+ and macOS High Sierra+, then you never actually received the true plaintext password and so it is not saved in your keychain.\nInstead, you get a kind of alphanumeric hash that was based on that password. Your device can use that hash to connect to the WiFi, but it's not feasible to reconstruct the original password from it.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am seeing these alphanumeric hashes for certain WiFi networks because I must have entered the true password on iOS and then explicitly shared it to my Mac (instead of relying on iCloud Keychain sync, to sync the true passwords across devices).\n\n*since that hash is all that's saved in my keychain, I have no way to recover the true password\n\n*whenever you use the \"Share Password\" feature to share a WiFi password to nearby devices, you're not actually sharing the password but only access to the network.\n\nA: This is a really simple guide to view your macOS keychain passwords:\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2008/09/25/mac-101-retrieve-your-keychain-passwords/\n", "Q: URLs getting truncated in QuarkXpress running on macOS Mojave I've just noticed a problem with QuarkXPress that may or may not be related to macOS Mojave.\nSometimes when I add a new hyperlink or edit an existing one, the full URL path is being truncated and this breaks the link.\nHas anyone else experiencing the same? If yes, did they manage to fix it?\n\nA: Until recently this was actually a known problem in QuarkXPress (and I may add still is for a lot of other software that deals with URLs). Basically, the issue is that the maximum character length of the URL field in the New/Edit\nHyperlink box is 250 characters and, as a result, longer links were truncated. This issue is unrelated to macOS.\nHowever, this issue was resolved when QuarkXpress 2018 was released in May 2018. I believe the issue still exists in QXP 2017 and earlier and, if so, you’d have to upgrade to QXP 2018.\nIf in fact you’re using QXP 2018, your best bet would be to check for any updates (you can do this via the Quark Update preference pane in Apple > System Preferences). If you’re using QuarkXpress 2018 Pro (the version sold on the Mac App Store), then you’ll need to check via the App Store for any updates.\nHowever, my understanding is that this issue was resolved with release 14.0 (which was the first public release of QXP 2018 in May). See QuarkXPress 2018 Known and Resolved Issues.\nIf the issue still persists you’d be best to contact Quark Technical Support and/or visit their online forums.\n", "Q: Blocked websites on macOS host but not on Win7 virtual machine In China there in the Great Firewall which blocks i.e. youtube.

I do have a very recent Time Machine backup to which I can revert, but I'm not sure what caused the issue and if this will occur again (or escalate from this point).\n\nA: Thanks to Olleg's link in his answer, it becomes clear that to find the file referenced in Disk Utility's error message has to be converted to an inode number first.\nThe \"oid\" (object ID) is hexadecimal, while the \"inum\" (inode number) is decimal.\nYou can either manually convert it to decimal, or use one of the many online converters.\nIn your case with an OID 0x3024a71c3, the converted inode number is 12923335107.\nTo search for the file with the inode number (inum), launch Terminal from /Applications/Utilities/, or find it via Spotlight and type:\nfind / -inum 12923335107 -print 2> /dev/null\n\nThis should show you the file in question, including path, in its output.\nIn Olleg's link this seems common for the OneDrive folder.\nThe inode is also shown, when running a file system check with the debug flag (-d) on the container: fsck_apfs -d\nExample: APFS: fsroot tree is invalid after Time Machine backup - how to recover and avoid in the future?\n\nA: For those who don't want to do a clean install of macOS, here's what I did. After having the same problem, and finding that it has definitely everything to do with OneDrive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download everything from OneDrive to Mac, if that was not the case already.\n\n*Quit OneDrive.\n\n*Uninstall OneDrive, I used AppCleaner app. Make sure to delete the OneDrive app, all the files related to it, the login items and launch agents. App Cleaner app makes this part easy.\n\n*Delete all keychain items related to OneDrive.\n\n*Delete the login item permission from System Preferences → Users & Groups → Your username → Login Items.\n\n*Copy all the folders and files from the OneDrive folder to an external HDD. The OneDrive folder is usually directly on your user main folder. Everything that was previously on OneDrive should be there.\n\n*Delete the OneDrive folder.\n\n*Empty the Trash.\n\n*Copy all the contents of the OneDrive folder from the external HDD back to Mac, where you want them to reside. This is an important part, this copy and restore operation to an external HDD is what resets whatever mess OneDrive did with the permissions or flags of the offending files.\n\n*Verify MacintoshHD with Disk Utility's First Aid, Onyx or with the command line on Terminal. Whatever method you were using that made you realize about the inode_val problem as per this thread discussion. You shouldn't have more warnings, but in case you do, those warnings are pointing to files that had to do something with OneDrive at some point in time.\nSo what I followed Redman's Jan 23 at 18:00 instructions above to locate in Finder the first item that appears in the list of warnings from the verify operation, then copied the entire folder containing the file to the external HDD. I copied the whole folder because it is probable that there are other files in that folder that generate the warning, because they could have something to do with OneDrive in the past. Then deleted the folder on Mac, restore it from the external HDD and verified again. I had to do this around five or six times because those were files that I moved to OneDrive or synched them or something in the past and of course I didn't remember.\n\n*Delete the contents of the OneDrive folder on your external HDD if you want.\n\n*Remember to always doubt about the quality of Microsoft products, some are good products but unfortunately others are very low quality.\nThe whole process took me about half an hour, but I got rid of the warnings.\nI used a 13\" Mid 2015 MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.4.\n\nA: The answer is here. I has the same problem, now it's fixed.\nhttps://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/913525-onedrive-on-mac/suggestions/36302779-remove-warning-inode-val-object-invalid-bsd-fl\n\nA: OK, I figured out a solution to the dreaded \"Warning: inode_val:.....\" fiasco. This same issue has been plaguing my 2018 MB Pro for several months now, until now I finally had the time to dive it into the issue and created a resolution, I hope the below works for you all as well. Apple and Microsoft really need to get their acts together to create a patch for this problem, such a PITA complete loss users of data, information and time troubleshooting. \nFor starters, I am not certain what set this off to begin with but it appears to be 2 things possibly, some type of file or file name corruption within OneDrive which is also connected to drive imagery backup solutions such as TimeMachine and Carbon Copy, which I use all three, OneDrive, TimeMachine and Carbon Copy. When running Disk Utility from \"Command-R\" I would get the \"Warning: inode_val:......\" and also noticed that my 1 TB ssd was nearly maxed out with over 500 GB compromised by System Data, the highest System Data tapped out one day at 650 GB (See Below Screenshot).\nMy Troubleshooting: After multiple attempts and several variations of completely wiping my ssd and OS, starting with a clean install these were my results:\n\n\n*\n\n*First Attempt: Command-R | wipe ssd and attempted back up from TimeMachine partition resulted in a completely failed restoration process, all TimeMachine back-ups were corrupted and would not work.\n\n*Second Attempt: Command-R | wipe ssd and attempted backup from Carbon Copy partition completed restored my device and all files but cloned the same corrupted files over from OneDrive resulting in the same \"Warning: inode_val:.....\" error when running Disk Utility.\n\n*Third Attempt: Command-R | wipe ssd and this time did not connect and external Thunderbolt 3 devices, and conducted a fresh install of OS Mojave from the Apple Server. Presto! Warning: inode_val: problem solved, after booting up the the fresh OS install, I installed OneDrive waited for all files download, then restarted the machine, Command-R to run Disk Utility and boom no more errors. So in short, Do Not try and restore you machine from previous corrupted backup sources as this will bring the same corrupted files back to your new install. With the new installed I also recovered 75% of my compromised ssd storage. One final note, I am completely abandoning the use of TimeMachine, this is no longer a reliable or stable solution for file or system restoration.(See Final Screenshots)\n", "Q: ls -axi (what does it do)?

At the beginning of this problem the phone would need about 1h. Every time when my phone goes off again the time to switching on goes up.\nWhat does this all look like? Well, when my phone died I put it on the charger, then the logo appears and goes off. When it goes off, a black screen pops out with a little white line on in it, then it turns on back to Apple logo. It keeps doing this until it turns on which is 1 or 2 even now 3 days.\nI tried to restore it and also update it but nothing happens, literally nothing happened.\n\nA: \n...when my phone died I put it on the charger, then the logo appears\n  and goes off. When it goes off, a black screen pops out with a little\n  white line on in it, then it turns on back to Apple logo. It keeps\n  doing this until it turns on which is 1 or 2 even now 3 days.\n\nThis is indicative of a battery failure and you need to have it replaced. \nYour battery is having difficulty holding a charge under a certain level (batteries are really never at 0V).   The battery itself has an operating range - it may be 12 to 8 volts DC.  Under 8V, it will give you the black screen and not power on until it reaches that minimum threshold.  If it's taking 2 or 3 days to meet that threshold, it means that the battery's capacity has diminished to a point that the charger can barely keep up with the dissipation - think \"keeping your head above water\" analogy.\nThere will come a point in time (very soon) where the charger simply won't be able to charge the cell(s) anymore.  \n", "Q: How do I get out of split screen mode when I never entered it completely? On occasion, when attempting to either go into fullscreen or maximize a window, I will accidentally trigger the split screen setup, where half of the desktop turns blue.  However, if the application doesn't support split screen, it gets stuck this way.  The top taskbar is gone, so there are no menus.  Cmd + Tab doesn't do anything.  Trying to drag any window into the blue area or the other side doesn't do anything, except maybe move the blue area from one side to the other.  The only fix I've found so far is to completely shut the machine off, as I can't log out (I just Googled and found a way to do so via CLI, but that's not intuitive for most).\nIs there a way to either cancel split screen or successfully enter into split screen so that I can then exit?\n\nA: Pressing Esc has worked for me.

As mentioned it is probably installed via something you installed by Homebrew.\nI would recommend a AntiVirus\n\nA: After some digging, since I also have the same thing, I found that it is a crypto mining malware that can be bundled with software, notably pirated softs. \nI checked out \"/usr/local/Cellar/qemu/3.0.0/bin/qemu-system-x86_64\" and found other files.\nCheck around for a couple other files.

Judging by the lines inside the plist, it probably is. Also, If you find that your mac fan is throttling but you are not using and heavy apps, it is also a very clear indicator that cryptocurrency mining malware is present. Good thing you deleted the binary. \nOne more thing, I also found a bunch of files that are related through going to finder, pressing Command-Shift-G and typing \"/System\" (no brackets for any of the directories). I then put in the search bar \"qemu\" and clicked on the \"system\" button instead of This Mac, and that is how I found a plist file that is stated. BUT PLEASE READ. Instead of searching qemu, I searched instead \"x86_64\" (no brackets). This brought up a couple files, like 8. Delete them too.

I have a Late 2011 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz Intel Core i7) for six years which means no Apple Care or Warranty. One day, Just after a Normal Boot the Audio was not coming and the Audio was permanently muted but since I heard a lot about these issues on MCP from this era I did a small research on google and found these two websites, one from Apple and another from Joseph Hall's Blog. Joseph's Solution worked a dozen times and never did again. I tried the Toothpick method(Stick a nonconductor inside the audio jack) as said on the Apple Forum but no luck. After some further research, I figured out that the switch between Optical and Digital is something which the IC in the motherboard controls. Now I can only hear the output from a headphone or via Airplay (Apple TV). Should I change the motherboard in order to hear the sound? Thank You! \nPS: This is not a duplicate and if you think so then please leave a comment below and I'll clarify it. I'll try my best to make the question more clear for every user.\n\nA: It's unclear what you mean by \"Normal Digital audio out.\" Optical digital audio out is the digital audio output if you're not using external USB/firewire/thunderbolt audio, so unless you're working with external audio interfaces switching between optical and digital does not apply as they refer to the same thing. I'm assuming you want to be able to use speakers and headphones as normal?\nYou've correctly identified that the audio codec IC on the motherboard controls this selection, and although many users find that toothpicks or blowing really hard or a dab of isopropyl alcohol on a toothpick works for them, it's possible for the little switch inside the headphone jack to become nearly permanently stuck. Since the headphone jack still works with headphones plugged in, that rules out the audio codec and means it's a problem with the switch itself. Somehow, headphones take priority over the digital output if both switches are on at the same time.\nThe solution, which I've described in the iFixit link you referenced in your question, and which originally comes from stin17 on this MacRumors thread, is intimidating but uncomplicated. We simply want to interrupt the line between the audio codec IC on the logic board and the little switch in the headphone jack by removing a component in between. This is usually a small resistor on older models, and after the Retina MBPs I believe it is an inductor.\nIf you can correctly identify your logic board model number (physically located on the logic board itself, usually a 6- or 7-digit number; for example, my 2012 MBP with a 2.3GHz i7 is a model A1286 and board number 820-3330-B) and find the boardview and schematic, you'll be able to find a resistor in line with the digital output switch, which, when removed, will prevent the audio codec IC from reading the digital switch. This permanently disables the optical digital/TOSLINK audio output, and you should not do this unless you are certain you've found the right resistor! However, if you're sure you know which components you're looking at, it takes about 10 seconds to scrape the tiny surface-mount resistor off the logic board with an x-acto knife.\nIf you have an A1286 macbook, it is likely R6805, which you can find in schematics and boardviews; this part number will certainly be different on other models. On my logic board, the circuit we want to interrupt is labeled AUD_PORTB_DET_L. Later models seem to rename this circuit to AUD_CONN_TIPDET_1 or AUD_CONN_TIPDET_2; I'd guess TIPDET_1 is headphone detection and TIPDET_2 is TOSLINK detection, but I'm not positive since I don't have one of those boards to check. Make sure you double check these on your particular model! I can't guarantee that R6805 is the one to get, but that's a good place to start.\nThe result here is that the digital switch inside the headphone jack remains physically stuck, but it no longer matters as it cannot complete its circuit to erroneously tell the audio IC that there is a TOSLINK plug in the jack. Again, optical digital audio output over TOSLINK does not work after doing this, unless you replace the resistor, but it sounds like you don't need optical digital audio output. This is straightforward and familiar for some, for others it's new and terrifying! I started learning my way around schematics and boardviews because of this exact problem. If you feel up to the task and you don't need TOSLINK audio output from your headphone jack, this is the most reliable and elegant fix when the other temporary methods fail.\n\nA: Yes - you’ll need to repair the hardware switch or the sensor circuit that detects a connected headphone jack if it’s not just a simple cleaning. The logic board is the easiest component to swap if you can’t do surface mount soldering to repair the board itself. \n", "Q: Obtain Java 11 for macOS? I know in recent years the Java development cadence has changed, becoming much more rapid and more predictably scheduled. New plans were announced for regular Long-Term Support (LTS) releases. And I have heard Oracle changed their licensing terms for their Oracle-branded releases.\nAll of this has left me confused as to how and where I can obtain Java 11 or later for my Mac. Can someone give some general overview of my options?\n\nA: If you want to have the simplest life possible, install homebrew and then install java with brew cask install java.\n\nA: tl;dr\nIf you are an end-user needing a free-of-cost JVM to run a Java app on your Mac (rather than a developer), my personal recommendation is to download an .pkg file from AdoptOpenJDK.\n\nOpen that file to run a macOS installer.\n\nYou will then find a JVM installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. Later, you can upgrade in the same manner, deleting the old JVM from that folder. \n\nDetails\nYes, there have been several major changes to the evolution of Java in recent years, and they can be a bit confusing. \nMultiple vendors, both free and paid\nFirst, know that there are new options available for those wishing to pay for commercially supported implementations of Java. And know that Java is still available freely without cost. For both a summary as well as the gory details, read this white paper published by major figures in the Java community: Java Is Still Free\nOpenJDK\nSecondly, know that all releases for Java 11 and later for macOS are based on the same codebase, the open-source project known as OpenJDK. \nApple contributes Mac-specific code to this project, and has staff working on this to make sure that Java continues to work well on macOS. \nIBM, Oracle, and many other companies have contributed code and testing as well. Oracle has recently announced their intention to reach feature-parity between their own Oracle-branded Java releases and the OpenJDK product; this even included the donation of some of their previously-commercial tools such as Flight Recorder to OpenJDK. \nThe upshot is that you should see very similar behavior and features across the various sources of Java for macOS.\nJVM bundled within desktop apps\nIf you make desktop apps to run locally on a Mac or other computer, you may continue to do so, and keep on using Swing and/or JavaFX as always. But the delivery of your app will change. \nJava Applet and Java Web Start technologies are being phased out. Oracle will no longer encourage end-users to have a JVM by itself installed. Instead, Oracle advises building your app as a standalone executable with a JVM bundled inside. This has already been commonly done on Macs, especially so if delivering an app through the Apple App Store. That approach is the new normal, to be done across all platforms including macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.  The new Java Modularization technology that began with Java 9, including the jlink and jpackage tools, make it easier than ever to bundle a down-sized JVM with your app. \nFor more info, see the white paper Java Client Roadmap Update of 2018-03.\nSo, for the purpose of bundling with your app, you will need to consider redistribution/deployment rights when choosing a JVM vendor and product. \nChoosing a vendor\nSome major vendors of Java to consider for Java 11 and later:\n\n\n*\n\n*Azul SystemsOffering two product lines, Zulu based directly on OpenJDK with possibly a few tweaks, and Zing a specially-enhanced version of the Java platform.\n\n*OracleOffering their own commercial product Oracle JDK and the quite-similar free-of-cost and GPL-licensed jdk.java.net.\n\n*AdoptOpenJDK.netOffering free-of-cost builds of Java based on OpenJDK. Choose between with the usual HotSpot engine (just-in-time compiler & optimizer) or the OpenJ9 engine from Eclipse (previously from IBM). \n\n\nHere is a diagram chart that may help guide your decision-making. This chart is not necessarily complete or accurate. It is simply meant to help get you oriented. You should research further your options. \n\n\n\n", "Q: How to connect MacBook Pro to an iMac with a 3rd party keyboard? I was following the instructions here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592\nwhich say to press CommandF2 and that works fine when I use my Apple keyboard. However, I want to connect my Apple keyboard to my MacBook Pro so I wanted to use some other keyboard to enable target display mode (i.e display my MacBook Pro on my iMac). \nI obviously opened the keyboard viewer on the imac to make sure I am pressing CommandF2 and I am.

I tried all the F1,...etc.\nAnyway, is there a way to connect my MacBook Pro with a 3rd party keyboard?\n\nI did noticed that despite me pressing F2 on the Mac keyboard the keyboard view did say I did press F2 but in the Mac it DOES say I press CommandF2 on the keyboard viewer. Odd.\n\nSome instructions on that page if CommandF2 doesn't work:\n\nIf Command-F2 doesn't work If your iMac doesn't\n  switch to Target Display Mode when you press\n  Command-F2, check these things:\nMake sure that the iMac you're trying to use as a display supports\n  Target Display Mode.  Target Display Mode works only when your primary\n  Mac is logged in to a macOS user account. For example, if your first\n  Mac is at the FileVault login screen, pressing Command-F2 on your iMac\n  does not enable Target Display Mode. You must first log in to your Mac\n  (using a regular display, if necessary) before you can use an iMac in\n  Target Display Mode. Make sure that you're pressing Command-F2 on the\n  keyboard that's connected to the iMac you want to use as a display. In\n  Keyboard System Preferences, if the checkbox is enabled for \"Use all\n  F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,\" the key combination\n  changes to Command-Fn-F2.

The actual \"F2\" comes up as scan code 128 and will do so on both your Apple (when pressing the fn) and Dell keyboards.\nSince you've already tried turning off \"use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard functions keys\", your keyboard doesn't support this.  You most likely need an Apple keyboard or at minimum, a keyboard with \"enhanced\" function keys; with a fn to change the function.\n\nA: Like Allan said, when you pressing F2 (yes, it's labeled \"F2), you're actually pressing \"Brightness Up.\" Most 3rd party keyboards in the market are made for windows, they actually don't have the key of \"Brightness Up\" button. In order to get the \"Brightness up\" button, you will need to install a software to remap the keyboard, like Karabiner-Elements, it will help you remap your F2 to Brighteness Up. After modify the button, you would able to activate the target Display Mode with any keyboard you have.\nHope that helps. \n", "Q: How Do I Gain Access To The Content Folder Of A .jar File? I want to use a modded Minecraft launcher on my Mac but the launcher I want to use is from an unidentified developer. When I try to open the app it says “TechnicLauncher.jar” is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?\" and it is preventing me from being able to play. I play on a Mac that I am not an admin and I can't get access to change the setting. So I was wondering how to gain access to the apps' content folder so that I can copy it into another folder that I can then turn into a .jar file.\n\nA: Two questions here so we might need to split off the question into two, but here goes. Jar files are zip, so you can drag them onto the Archive utility or another utility to uncompress them. \nBefore you do that, try locating the jar file in finder and then use the right click / control click to open the file. That lets you get a prompt to open non gatekeeper signed files if the Mac is configured with default settings. \nIf that doesn’t work, you’ll need help from the administrator to allow you to access that program or have to take it to another computer. Good luck with the Minecraft and mods you might try once you tap into the zip file contents. \n", "Q: Can I use variable in Numbers cell formula?

That being said, I followed a Youtube video months back, when I first started on how to get my desktop audio through OBS. I did everything the video said and for a good amount of time everything was all good. Somewhere down the line the multimedia output that i selected in my sound preferences which was created after instaling soundflower was what i would select to get sound through OBS and still be able to hear everything through my scarlet 2i2. There was one time it just stopped working and I only heared audio if I selected the scarlet. I didn't pay no mind to it and idk what happened exactly, but it fixed itself. So I went back to the streams and today my computer overheated, froze all up and I restarted it. Uppon it booting back up the multimedia-output was not working or so I thought. Turned out the stream could still hear the desktop audio, but for some reason it wouldn't play it through my scarlet, so I could NOT hear what they were hearing. I'm sure there's a fix for this somehow. I just dont know enough to fix it myself. Please, can anyone help me out here?\n\nA: While I don't fully understand what you're doing and what goes wrong I can't tell you how to configure Sound Flower the right way. But I know an alternative solution.\nUsing Audio MIDI Setup, to send Audio to multiple devices:\nYour Mac has Audio MIDI setup installed by default.

Indexing can take hours on a large mechanical hard drive. This is usually required after an OS update.\nYou can restart and rebuild the Spotlight index, which may help. Either use the Terminal command:\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\n(You'll then have to enter your admin password. If you've never done this before, you'll see a short warning about being careful.) \nOr go to System Preferences > Spotlight, and in the Privacy tab, drag the system volume to the list of exclusions. Then remove it.\nHanging Spotlight indexes may also be a sign of a failing hard drive, so it's also worth checking that your system volume is functioning correctly.\n", "Q: Storing SSH passphrase in memory but not saving it to the keychain persistently Answers to this question explain how to have SSH passphrases added to the keychain when they are entered.  Having recently upgraded from a previous version of OSX, I'm used to the passphrases being stored in memory but not in persistent storage.  If setting UseKeychain yes causes passphrases to be stored to disk, is there a way to prevent this?  IE I'd like to avoid having to re-enter them except after having rebooted.  It seems less than ideal to store a passphrase in a location protected with a potentially less secure password.\n\nA: Set UseKeychain no (the default) and run ssh-add without the -K option.\nNote that this does not store the pass phrase in memory; instead, it causes ssh-agent to keep the decrypted key in memory, and subsequent uses of ssh will then work without the need to supply the pass phrase.\nIf you already have the pass phrase stored in the keychain, you'd need to use the Keychain Access application to find the pass phrase and delete it.\n", "Q: Dell DW15 docking station audio output set up with mac I'm using a Dell DW15 docking station with a mac High Sierra and wanted to ask how can I set up the audio output so that when I plug in the audio jack in to the docking station the audio output would go to the device connected to the docking station and when it's unplugged the audio output would go to the mac's built in speakers?\nCurrently it outputs the audio through the speakers in both scenario's.\nIf I go to System Preferences -> Sound -> Output\nand then choose the docking stations USB output it only outputs audio to the docking station, meaning that there is no sound when the audio jack is unplugged from the docking station.\n\nA: \nIf I go to System Preferences -> Sound -> Output and then choose the\n  docking stations USB output it only outputs audio to the docking\n  station, meaning that there is no sound when the audio jack is\n  unplugged from the docking station.\n\nThis is expected behavior.

When disc is plugged, system does decrypt its content and allow normal operations, leaving disc encrypted when disconnected from the system\n\n*Would external ssd's with hardware encryption benefit from it using MacOS built-in FileVault features, or does it only apply for disk manufacturer proprietary software?\n\n\nA: Yes, it is possible for macOS to automatically handle encryption of external drives in the sense that when you plug the disk in, you're asked for an unlock passphrase - and when you unmount the drive, it is encrypted and safe for transport.\nAn easy way to do this is to open Disk Utility and then plug in an empty external drive. Choose to Partition the drive (make sure the external drive is selected in the left side bar) - and choose to format the drive as \"APFS (Encrypted)\". You will automatically be asked for a passphrase, and the system will automatically ask you to unlock the drive when plugging it in.\nNOTE: Partioning and formatting the drive will erase your existing files on the drive. Please take a backup before doing so!\nRegarding your second question - no, FileVault does not as such benefit from hardware encryption feature on external SSDs. This is really a good thing, as recently it was unveiled that these hardware encryption features on many popular SSDs are really very insecure. For example by having built-in backdoor password that are extremely simple (such as a blank password). \nOn Windows the BitLocker feature in some cases rely on the external hardware's encryption features, and for those users that meant that their security had been compromised all along. Therefore, even though it sounds counter-intuitive, it was really an advantage that File Vault 2 does not rely on the encryption in the SSD controller of the external drive.\n", "Q: Where can I find original MacBook Pro batteries? I have a 2011 13\" MacBook Pro. I have replaced the battery once, replaced the charger two times (because it wore off/tore up). I have replaced the original drive with an SSD and pumped up the RAM so my MacBook runs pretty much like new with Sierra (upgraded).\nNow I am not taking chances on off-brand batteries because: \n\n\n*\n\n*they can potentially damage/brick my laptop (my replacement battery had swollen after an year).\n\n*replaced batteries do not fully hold the charge and have much smaller life times.\n\n*because my laptop is showing no sign of slowing down, I would rather replace the battery with the original so I can use it for another 5 years or so.\nThe problem is I can't find original the MacBook Pro battery for a 2011 laptop. I may visit a store to find out but is there a away I can order an original MacBook Pro 2011 13\" battery online?\n\nA: Apple don't sell batteries as spare parts to customers, and the Unibody MBP's battery is not 'user-serviceable'. Hence the funny tri-cornered screw heads. Anything you find on a third-party retailer's site is likely to be 'grey', even if claimed to be Apple-branded.\n(Having said that, I have bought several of such batteries for Unibody MBPs and they have worked well with no problems.)\nIf you take your MBP to an Apple Store, you should be able to get it replaced, but obviously Apple will charge you 'some money' for this.\n\nA: There are several posts already that address the questions you ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*When will my Mac (13inch MacBook Pro Mid 2013) become a un serviceable product in California?\n\n*Quality factors relevant for getting a replacement battery (MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012))\nContrary to popular belief, Apple doesn't make batteries.  Apple OEM's (licenses) their battery manufacturing to a supplier that stamps an Apple logo on them.  These same manufacturers will sell replacement batteries without the logo.\nLike with everything else, quality matters.  Battery manufacturers with a good history and a generous warranty have few, if any issues.  \nWith very rare exceptions, Apple doesn't make available parts for vintage hardware (between 5 and less than 7 years). You're 2011 is 8 years so it's highly unlikely you'll get a genuine battery (or new replacement parts for that matter) from Apple.\n", "Q: Repeated Corrupt Parallels .PVM file I have a case where my Parallels .PVM file appears to become corrupt.  This has happened 3 times over the past 9 months.  I’m wondering if this is possibly a hardware issue.\nHere is the normal course of events:\n\n\n*\n\n*While working in Parallels the VM freezes and becomes unresponsive. I get the spinning beach ball of death.\nEventually the Mac becomes unresponsive and a forced shutdown must be\nperformed.   \n\n*After rebooting the Mac, Parallels does not start.  It\nkeeps spinning but the VM window never opens.  Any attempt to do\nanything in Parallels makes the Mac unresponsive. \n\n*After another Mac reboot, attempting to copy the .PVM file to an external hard disk results in “The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code 100034).”\n\n*To fix the problem I have to delete the .PVM file and restore a backup of the file.\n\n\nAfter this initially happened I did a complete reformat of the Mac SSD and reinstall of the OS.  But the problem has resurfaced 2 times since.  I now regularly back up my .PVM file to an external SSD so I don’t lose everything.  I do regular backups with Time Machine but the .PVM file is excluded.\nRunning Disk First Aid shows this error:  “invalid file extent (id 0x….) logical address 193… (expected 192….). It does not provide an option to repair the disk.\nThis has happened with multiple Parallels versions and multiple Mac OS versions.\nI have contacted Parallels support but they have not provided any help.  I’ve searched for answers regarding the 100034 error code when copying the file but can’t determine anything definitive.\nDoes this sound like a hardware issue with the SSD?  Any other ideas of what might be causing this issue?\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), 16 GB, 500 GB SSD \nmacOS Mojave 10.14.1 \nParallels Desktop v14.1 \nGuest OS:  Windows 10.  \n\nA: I have seen the exact same issue, just happened again this week, Disk Utility sees an issue in that file (and a file copy isn't able to complete once it's in that state) but Disk Utility isn't able to repair (even when Mac booted to Repair mode), only fix I've seen is to kill/restore the PVM, I also do a reformat of the SSD but don't think it's necessary.\nMy guess is that it's an edgecase Mac filesystem bug exposed through how Parallels does PVM, perhaps related to Win10 disk mgmt that does interesting things under the covers (defrag etc. is now all hidden and happens behind the scenes).  \nSimilar specs (Parallels 14.1.2, Win10, Mojave (currently 10.14.3), also 500G 16GB Macbook Pro Retina 15 but mine is a late 2013.\n\nA: TLDR;\nIn case anyone else runs into this issue, I appear to have been able to fix it AND save my VM:\n\n*\n\n*Copy the .hds disk image (inside the .hdd bundle inside the .pvm bundle) to another drive using the dd command with Terminal\n\nCopying via the Finder fails as described above. It still works after copying it back to the internal SSD.\n\nI had the EXACT same problem, right down to trying to copy my VM to an external disk (to see if it was an SSD error) and getting the 100034 error and needing to reboot twice to get Parallels to launch.  I came across this post by googling that error code.\nI have iStat menus and observed that frequently, while using my VM - I'm not sure of the trigger prl_disp_service would peg at 30MB/s disk read; this was when everything went to hell.  My Mac host OS would go from sluggish (blocking on disk IO?) to frozen altogether.  Killing prl_disp_service wouldn't clear the 30MB/s read, it would just move it to kernel_task or hide its source altogether.  CPU for prl_disp_service was slightly elevated but nowhere near pegged.  Also, 30MB/s is nowhere near pegged for disk I/O either.\nAfter (stupidly) trying to reclaim disk space so I could move my VM to an external drive - and having the disk reclaimer fail with the same 30MB/s lockup and system fault, ultimately freezing the entire host OS - I could no longer start my VM at all.  No reports of corruption, just the same hangup.  But the disk resizer is a different process and Windows is not running.\nI would also add that the failure of Parallels to launch after the first reboot was the Parallels application, not the virtual machine.  But maybe it does some scan or something if it was force-quit while a VM was running that triggered the issue?\nI'm not sure what the root cause is, but I suspect Jim hit the nail on the head: that it's Parallels exposing some bug in the file system.  Maybe resulting from the switch to APFS?  I would further speculate that it may have been related to expanding the disk image size.  The issue started after a Windows update, but I had also just installed SolidWorks, and had recently updated Parallels from 15.1.4 to 15.1.5.  At first rolling back to 15.1.4 seemed to fix the problem - or at least cause it to recover sometimes - but it quickly became unusable.\nMacbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.6\nParallels 15.1.4 or 15.1.5\nWindows 10 19042.928\n\nA: I have encountered this issue several times over the years. Sometimes, it can be fixed by right-clicking on the PVM file and selecting “Show Package Contents,” then right-clicking the .hdd file and selecting “Get Info.” Scroll down to ”Sharing & Permissions.” \nIf the staff permission is “No Access”, change it to “Read & Write”. All users who should have access to the Windows file should be “Read & Write”. \nYou may need to enter an Admin password to authenticate. (Parallels should of course not be running when you do this, and you should reboot afterwards) \nThis doesn’t always work for me, but it has helped enough to be a good tip.\n", "Q: How to merge multiple image files into one pdf file with page and its original size for every image?

Is it possible to write an app for the iOS App Store, where developers can write Web apps to run on the top of your app. The developer's app will run in a Web View that has been injected with a cookie with session information about the user logged into your app.\nAt the end of the day, this is just a Web browser with no native capabilities.

If so, what if you did some sort of token system where a user could buy token's through an In-App Purchase that they can then use to purchase apps on your market place?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to write such an app. It is actually very simple as what you're describing is really just a specialised form of an ordinary web browser. You'll find multiple browser apps on the App Store, so these apps are well established.\nYes, Apple could possibly deny such an app from being listed on the App Store. It is their store after all, so in theory they have the possibility of denying any app. This is not the same as saying that this app will be denied - not at all.\nYes, it is possible to create such a \"token system\".

I'm trying to write a fairly simple AppleScript to automate the process of having Calendar events repeat in bulk. Specifically, I want every event on a given calendar within a given time span to have its repetition set to be biweekly.\nThis seems like a fairly routine and quick task, but the script below, when run on approximately 30 events in a one-week span, takes about an hour and a half to complete. Moreover, this is only true if I leave the computer untouched while the script runs; if I try to use the laptop simultaneously, the script eventually fails with an error indicating that an Apple Event timed out.\nIndeed, iterating through calendar events and accessing or modifying any of their properties seems to take an astronomically long time in AppleScript (for instance, just calling log on the summary of each event). I've tried moving the event fetch to a separate variable and using attributes other than event dates to fetch the events, but nothing seems to improve performance.\nWhat is the reason for this incredible slowness, and what can be done to alleviate it? Or is this simply an inherent part of AppleScript/the macOS Scripting Bridge/Calendar itself?\nHere is the script in question:\ntell application \"Calendar\"\n    set cal to calendar 1 whose name is \"Schedule\"\n    set theStartDate to date \"Sunday, January 27, 2019 at 00:00:00\"\n    set theEndDate to date \"Saturday, February 2, 2019 at 00:00:00\"\n    repeat with e in (every event of cal whose start date is greater than theStartDate and start date is less than theEndDate)\n        set esStartDate to e's start date\n        set theWeekday to weekday of esStartDate\n        set lower to text 1 thru 2 of (theWeekday as string)\n        set upper to do shell script \"echo \" & lower & \" | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]\"\n        set e's recurrence to \"FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;UNTIL=20190602T035959Z;BYDAY=\" & upper & \";WKST=SU\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nLooking at the \"Replies\" console, the script slows both on the initial count every event of calendar id \"[ID]\" Apple Event as well as on each attempt to modify an event's recurrence.\nI'm running macOS Mojave 10.14.2 (Calendar 11.0) on a MacBook Pro early 2015.\n\nA: Use CalendarLib. CalendarLib is a Script Library that lets you work with Calendar events without using the Calendar app. It is very, very fast:\n\nCalendarLib\nCalendarLib is an AppleScript script library for manipulating calendar events without using Calendar.app. It requires OS X 10.9 or later, as well as the BridgePlus script library.\n\nI do not know why Calendar is so slow with AppleScript.\n", "Q: How to remove an iPhone from the device list in Console.app Today I opened Console.app and I found that my Mac can read logs from an iPhone which I connected to build an app quite a long time ago. The problem is that I now cannot find a way to remove this iPhone from this list.\n\nI checked Window -> Devices & Simulators in XCode, it is not there. I also checked in iTunes, found nothing\nI have no clue how to get completely disconnected from this iPhone.

Thanks a lot.\n\nA: By following one suggestion from the discussion:\n\nI had the same problem when connecting iPad Pro (iOS 12.01) to a MacBook Pro (OS X 10.13.6). Changing the lightning cable did not help. Then I connected the lightning cable to the USB port on the HDMI port side of the notebook and everything worked just fine. I suspect that there is a problem with the USB port on the left hand side of the machine\n\nSo everything works after I use the right hand side USB port instead of the left hand side. I have no ideas why. My left hand side USB port is working fine with my USB external drive and all other USB devices I ever used with this macbook. \nThis is just weird to me.\n", "Q: Why system-wide socks proxy doesn't work for Chrome? First of all, I'm not asking how to enable proxy in Chrome. I've already done it with SwitchySharp extension.\nThe question I'm about to ask, is the mechanism under OSX's network preference setting and chrome's mechanism.\nThe phenomenon:\nI used ssh -D 7001 my_user@my_host to build a local socks server.\nAnd I set System Preferences -> network -> current_wifi -> Advanced -> Proxies -> \"Select\" SOCKS Proxy -> \"Input\" 127.0.0.1:7001\nAt this time point, when I use safari to open a website, it use this 7001 socks proxy, but when use chrome, it doesn't.\nSo, when I set that socks proxy parameters in System Preferences, what did OSX do? And how did Chrome bypass this socks proxy setting?\n\nA: It isn't that Chrome bypassed it, it \"ignores\" it (because it might not have implemented reading the values).\nI did find some docs that show how to manually set Chrome on Mac to use SOCKS:\nhttps://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/socks-proxy\n(if my memory bank properly translated what I read).\nI couldn't find any docs from Google that said: Chrome on MacOS will obey SOCKS prefs.\nBefore someone down votes this because it sounds incorrect...\nProxy support for apps usually comes down to three things:\nSupport for HTTP proxy (FTP is really HTTP), HTTPS (Connect) and SOCKS of two versions.\nEach of these is pretty different than the other, but the standard dialog boxes originally designed by Netscape made them look like they were simply operating in parallel. Users assume that a browser that works with one setting in the dialog should work with all the others, that simply isn't true from a feature/support/protocol/code perspective.\nFor MacOS browsers, the browser developer had to decide if they would support the proxy type, and then how would they read the system settings, if they supported the system settings. This is why for a long time Camino (Mozilla browser for MacOS-only supported OS settings, but Firefox (Mozilla browser for all platforms) did not. \n(As best as I can remember... I was Proxy QA for Netscape/Mozilla back in the day.)\n", "Q: Is Spotlight index on an external USB drive reused when connected to a different Mac? I have a 10TB external usb drive that is shared among 3 Macs. It has been indexing for a while now and I'm worried that every time I connect it to a different Mac it gets reindexed. Is the index shared between Macs? does it create an independent index per Mac? Is the index being overwritten every time I connect it to a different Mac? Should I disable Spotlight (I would prefer to use it)\n\nA: Every time you connect your drive to a different computer it gets indexed on the computer. Since your drive is 10TB indexing can take quite a while regarding how much data stored on it. I would suggest to deactivate indexation in the Spotlight options (indexing slows the computer down) but I noticed that un mounting/mounting the device to your/a computer erases the parameter in Spotlight so indexation is back on for the drive!  (on my system)\nI hope this answers your question. \n==> I forgot to mention that I have to delete all the 'fancy' dirs that macOS creates on my external drives to avoid issues when I connect these external drives to my DJ equipment.\nI learned the hard way that if I don't remove those dirs, that it possibly will brake my ext. drive!

Is this a nefarious business tactics? Because it seems not to have solution at all while having an APFS disk!\n\nA: Okay I solved the problem. First I created a backup, because everything got erased!\n\n\n*\n\n*I restarted my MacBook in Recovery mode (Command + R)\n\n*Went to the Disk Utility\n\n*Clicked on my SSD that was in APFS\n\n*Clicked on Erase, and chose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with GUID Partition Map\n\n*After it was done, went back to the previous menu in Recovery mode and clicked to Reinstall Mac OS\n\n*I chose the new disk to install macOS (it took me around 30-60 minutes)\n\n\nAfter installing macOS you can set your previous Time Machine backups. Finally I'm done, and now it enables me to partition my disk.\nThe problem was the APFS didn't enabled me to partition, only HFS+.\nBut be careful: since APFS is now the standard filesystem on Apple devices and if it has some important advantages which is not supported by HFS+ you will be messed up.\nTake a look at APFS advantages before you choose.\nAlthough you can reset your disk back to APFS anytime you want, but you might miss the ability of partitioning.\nI think if you want to keep your drive as APFS you can purchase an external hard drive (it doesn't cost so much, but indeed needs extra care if you are working with a laptop).\nEdit: After I erased my SSD with HFS+, I tried to erased it with APFS once again. (the whole SSD) And this time, it enabled me to partition in APFS. :)\n", "Q: What font does macOS Mojave use? What font is used in the macOS Mojave GUI?

After typing it in once, Safari replaced it in both input fields with a generated strong password. In the menu on the bottom I tried to select “other password” (instead of the generated one), but it did not work. Also it seems the new password was submitted to the website as next time I could not log in with the old password.\nThe problem is, Safari did not remember the new password, so now I’m locked out of the website.\nI can start a password reset process, but want first to look for other solutions. Is there any chance the password is stored somewhere?\nI googled but only found “this happened to me too and I know no solution” stories.\nThis was on an iPad with iOS 12.1.1\n\nA: Currently on my iPhone and that’s why my typing is poor. \nNot only you. It happens to me too. \nAnd it happens on Mac book pro and iPad pad pro. \nThe solutions I’ve tried include looking in my passwords; no solution provided. Other solution includes backspacing on that website looking at history, taking a picture of the password (The problem with that is I can never get a full picture of the password as it fades in the field). \nI believe that it’s due to the different URLs that the webpage is used when creating a pass.  Often I have to go to my gmail to authenticate  The password, and then I am directed to a different URL. And then everything is messed up. \nWhat I’m doing is using a password that’s real simple to create an account. Once the account is created I go in and reset the password  with the strong password and it seems to work. \n\nA: Sadly this is a problem that happens with certain websites, and sometimes due to a small hick-up. (of you followed some of the links on google they all have there reasons, Im sure I don't have to repeat them here)\nWhy they haven't got a feature (like Dashlane) to show you the recently created but not saved passwords is a mystery to me.\nAFAIK you'll have to reset your password. \n\nA: Just ran into this and there is indeed a solution, on your browser. After resetting password I proceeded to the login page, and apple has a suggestion “use password saved from earlier today”. I couldn’t find this password when I tried to login from the app. After filling the saved password , I added the username and logged in. It prompted to update the saved password and then I was able to find it in keychain. Horrible UX \n\nA: I had this problem recently but worked out it occurred on a website that did not need a username or email address, but only a password.\nSo when I generated a strong password, it was saved without a name. Then when I went to re-enter the saved password from the automatic prompt I could not find it from the search facility.\nEventually, found it from Settings, Passwords and Accounts then gave it a name for next time. \n\nA: One of the above tips helped me. I updated recommended security alert for a gmail account but it kept not updating the keychain and was repeatedly showing the old stored password unchanged in Apple Passwords. I went to the full list of saved passwords and it was there as an additional new google.com entry. The problem seems to have been that with google you can change your password from typing your account name with or without adding “gmail.com” to your account name. Apple can’t tell they are the same thing. Hope that helps for those with this specific website problem.\n\nA: If you log out of the site on which you just created the unknown password, then immediately begin to log in again: at the username/password form Mobile Safari will suggest the password that it recently saved. Cool!\nTo be able to suggest the password it must have stored it somewhere. Username/Passwords pairs are stored is in the Keychain, referred to as Passwords on iOS/iPadOS.\nTo find the account details you'll need to search for some specific aspect of it: website (URL), or account name (username).\nKeep in mind that a password for gmail.com, for example, may well be stored under google.com so be sure to look for the password with the correct terms.\niOS\nSettings > Passwords > (search)\nThe passwords are synced using iCloud Keychain if you have it enabled, so you can also get at them on your Mac.\nmacOS\nSafari > Preferences > Passwords > (enter macOS user password) > (search)\n\nA: I also was having this issue. What I noticed was that when using generate strong password, the pop up at the bottom of the screen, locks the screen. You can’t alter their generated password or copy it. And you can scroll down. So, in my instance, the button to push to submit the password change, was below the popped up password builder and I couldn’t scroll down to get to a submit button that I didn’t even know was there. So no new password was submitted.  That locking action doesn’t happen on choose your own PW.\n\nA: There's a bug in Safari's Suggest Password feature where it appears not to save your credentials after you accept its suggestion. Saving passwords on all browsers are really \"hacks\" where account and authentication pages are scraped for username and password fields and associated with the site's URL.\nUnfortunately, scraping isn't reliable. It's not uncommon for sites to use non-standard field naming conventions, custom field controls, and multipage authentication, making it difficult to detect the password, the username and the trigger conditions for saving them. Consequently, it sometimes saves blank or incorrect login information or doesn't suggest a password.\nOn rare occasions, it suggests a password but doesn't save it. In my case, for instance, when creating a new site in Godaddy.com, an account is already created with default login information in the settings screen. Since the username is fixed, it's presented as a plain label instead of a field. The password, however, can be changed. It appears as a series of asterisks in a plain label. Clicking on the Change link next to it brings up a dialog with the password and confirm password fields. Safari suggests a password but clicking the change button gives a false impression it has been saved. The autofill doesn't work and is there any record of the user name.\nGenerally, the bug stems from Safari suggesting a password but never carrying through with. In the case of GoDaddy.com, it's able to detect the password field, but unable to detect the username because its a field, attribute it to the correct URL because it's different from the current page's, and to save the information because Change button's action failed to trigger Safari.\nThere's really no solution to this bug, but Safari should at the least inform the user if it failed to save the suggested password. Fortunately, it occurs only on a few sites. To avoid the issue, you should double check your password has been saved and inform sites about the problem.\n", "Q: Is it advisable to calibrate the battery on a iPhone?

This shell function, date, takes this value (a large integer), which it understands as being a value in \"Unix time\", and re-formats it using a canonical representation as given by the tokens %b (representing a three-letter abbreviation for the month) and %Y (representing a four-digit number for the year).\nSo, for instance:\ndate -r 1534615274 \"+%b-%Y\"\n\nreturns:\nAug-2018\n\ninto which the files from August 2018 I had in my chosen folder were moved.  It did not create separate day-of-the-month folders, nor even separate year folders; only \"month-year\" folders.  So I am confused that you appear to have described what might be a different script entirely.\nThe script also has a number of qualities about it that irk me a great deal, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Its lazy usage of try...end try; \n\n*The insertion of literal single quotes surrounding a variable being used as part of a string, e.g.\ndo shell script \"find '\" & SortFolder & \"' -type f\" \n\ninstead of\ndo shell script \"find \" & quoted form of SortFolder & \" -type f\" \n\n\n*This bizarre formulation:\nif text (length of text of DroppedFolder) of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n\nwhich could be written as \nif text -1 of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n\nor as\nif the last character of DroppedFolder is not \"/\" then...\n\nor even \nif DroppedFolder does not end with \"/\" then...\n\n\n*And repeated use of do shell script, which is fine as a command tool to be invoked thoughtfully when needed, but when it populates the script as densely as it does this one, one wonders why the script wasn't just written as a shell/bash script to begin with.  It's also very costly in terms of overhead to create and destroy shell processes one after another like this script does.\nGiven these stylistic and functional drawbacks, plus the confusion over what the script is supposed to be doing currently versus what it actually appears to do, I felt it warranted a re-write:\nuse Finder : application \"Finder\"\nproperty rootdir : missing value\n\n# The default run handler when run within Script Editor\non run\n    using terms from scripting additions\n        set root to choose folder\n    end using terms from\n    set rootdir to Finder's folder root                         -- '\n    sortFiles()\nend run\n\n# Processes items dropped onto the applet.

In fact, the worst case scenario is the same as with your current script, which is the situation where you choose the wrong directory by mistake.  Assuming the correct directory is selected, then the worst case scenario is that files don't get moved, so it's generally a very safe script.\nI re-wrote the open handler too, to (hopefully) allow it to cater for multiple items being dropped onto the applet.  This means you could, for example, drop two folders onto it and have both folders' contents re-structured.  However, I haven't tested this.  Again, the worst case scenario here is that it doesn't do anything, which will be the case if I am wrong about what type of file reference gets passed to the open handler (I assume it will be alias objects).\n\nA: Change the %b, %Y etc\nHere is a key: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html\n", "Q: I need a keyboard shortcut for Adding Bookmarks for multiple tabs in Safari There was an older post about this question (link below) from a few years back but I'm wondering if that process no longer works due to iCloud bookmarks, Safari 12, new MacOS etc. \nWhat I would like to do is create a keyboard shortcut for the \"Add Bookmarks for These (XX) Tabs...\" in a current window of Safari. The System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts doesn't work since the menu label has to be exact and the tab number variable needs to change to match the number of tabs each time. I did do a test with 5 in there and that works for an instance with 5 tabs. Not sure if there is a variable that can be written in there that knows it needs to change. \nIf not through system settings, assuming it would need to be something like an Apple Script which would work as I'm trying to use Stream Deck to set a button to fire the script. \nAdding Bookmarks for multiple tabs in Safari with a keyboard shortcut\n\nA: OK, so the AppleScript required to click that menu item is quite simple:\nclick menu item 8 of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Bookmarks\" of menu bar 1\n\n\nTo come up with this particular incantation I used UI Browser.app (there's a free Trial). In UI Browser.app choose your Target app, use the column browse to find the menu item you are interested in, then use the AppleScript dropdown to copy the required snippet to your clipboard (or press Alt+Cmd+T). \n\nI made a small edit to the snippet to reference only the Bookmarks menu item by name.\n\nThe AppleScript snippet needs to be dressed up a little more to be useful:\nactivate application \"Safari\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Safari\"\n        click menu item 8 of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Bookmarks\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe works for both Safari and Safari Technology Preview, which is nice.\nRunning this in, say, macOS Script Editor.app will remotely click the referenced menu item and display the expected conformation dialog.\n\n\nNote: you could add additional AppleScript to manipulate and/or dismiss the confirmation dialog; I'll leave such changes as an exercise for the reader.\n\nFinally, we need to add a shortcut key to access the menu.

I have just purchased a new 2018 Mac Mini with a SSD drive.\nSometimes when reading or writing, it makes a quite screetchy noise. It's not loud, but however it's quite sharp which made me cautious.\nI was under the impression that SSD's don't make any particular noises. I have a MacBook Pro Late-2017 with a SSD, and I never hear it make any noises when read/writing.\nPlease have a listen to the audio file below. Note that the microphone is close to the computer, so the fan and screetch noise is relatively loud in the clip. In reality, it's noticeable but quite muted. Most of the screetch noise is heard in the beginning.\nhttps://vocaroo.com/i/s1piq8nQW12V\nPerhaps it's not even the SSD making these noises?\n\nA: If it's a \"screechy\" noise as you describe the it's very possible it could be either \"capacitor squeal or coil whine.\"\nIn the audio recording, the fan itself was generating a good deal of (normal) noise so it was difficult to separate the two.  One way to determine if  it is the fan or not is to remove the back cover and stop the fan with your finger while listening for the noise.  If it goes away, it's the fan, if not, it's the logic board or power supply.\nHowever, given that this is basically a brand new Mac mini, I would take it in for service even if it's just to get the problem logged.\n\nA: I have a 2018 Mini and it's virtually silent under normal conditions, so I'd say, No, it's not normal. \nIf mine did make those noises, I would take it back to the shop. \n", "Q: How do I fix iPhone SE celluar network after 12.1.2 upgrade?

In the settings of the Terminal app, in the advanced tab, there is an option to \"Paste newlines as carriage returns\" which is enabled by default. \nWhat is this good for?\n\nA: What is it good for?\nSometimes you want to paste exactly what you've copied into something...say a document you're editing in nano or vi and want to preserve it exactly as it is.\nOr, you could want to past the CR so it executes the command.\nPerhaps the default action to pastes exactly what was copied makes more sense than altering a paste buffer before the application processes the clipboard. \n\nA: Converts the ASCII \\n bytes into \\r bytes, or line feeds into carriage returns.  This way the system ignores any possible UNIX to MAC line-ending confusion when pasting from the Terminal.   \n\nA: This is very useful in some shells (zsh and bash work, but not tcsh for example) so that if you accidentally paste a whole lot of text, it is not immediately executed as a long series of commands. You can edit what is pasted or just abort using Ctrl-C.\nI also like it for copying a rectangular subselection of what's on the clipboard by dragging with the option key.\n", "Q: How to fix Macbook that did not completely install a new version of OS, so now its stuck in a error loop every time its turned on.

I know that I could use Cydia impactor or with a personal developer certificate, but this would require signing every few days if I remember correctly?\n\nA: If you are registered as a paid Apple developer (either as individual or an organisation), you can use TestFlight to easily share your app with friends and family. You'll need the Apple ID of the person and can add them as a tester.\nYou can add upto 1000 Apple IDs as tester under TestFlight and release the app. The individual members can install the app on their personal devices.\nUnlike using certificates and asking members to share their device UDIDs, this approach is seamless for both the parties. The shared app build remains valid for upto 90 days from the date of publishing. This process also makes it easy to push app updates.\nThe family members (testers) just need to have TestFlight app installed on their device to receive app builds and updates.

Not exactly what you want, but navigating to any other part is then just a mouse click away.\n\nA: My personal recommendation is always use the Spotlight Search (⌘ + space) and then start typing any program that you need (finder in this case).\n\nA: According to this Mac Rumors forum:\n\nThe way I do it is a quick two keyboard shortcut process. Press\n  Command Tab (similar to Window's Alt Tab function) and keep tabbing\n  until you select the Finder. Since Finder is always opened in Mac OS\n  it should always be available. After Finder is selected press Command\n  N to get a new Finder window.\n\n\nA: Press and hold the Command kay and keep tapping the Tab key until you switch to Finder.app. Now after you have released the Tab key, keep holding the Command key, press and hold the Option key and then leave the Command key.\nIf no Finder window was previously open, it will open a new window. If one were open before, this will bring it to front. If one were open and minimized, this will maximize it and bring it to front.\nOnce Finder.app is in focus, you can also use the keyboard shortcut Command + N to open a new window.\n", "Q: How to get to .ssh path on macOS?

I'd like to share my current Chrome page on macOS via AirDrop to an iOS device so that I can open it up in mobile Safari.\nIf I use Safari on a desktop, this is easily done via: Share > AirDrop.\nIs there an equally easy way to do this on Chrome?\nHow to Send Web Pages from Chrome to Your Phone and others recommend using a 3rd party tool called Pushbullet. This is cumbersome because it requires an extension to be installed on desktop Chrome, a 3rd party app installed on an iOS device, and will probably not open the page in mobile Safari (i.e. I'm guessing it'll open it up in mobile Chrome).\nHandoff can apparently solve this problem, but that requires you to  be logged in to the same Apple account on both devices. Is there a way that this can work without being logged in to the same device, just as AirDrop via Safari works?\n\nA: The easiest solution that requires no 3rd party software:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AirDrop in finder.\n\n*Drag the current page from Chrome (via the bookmark/lock icon) on to the device in the AirDrop window.\n\n\nThis will send a .webloc file that opens up in Mobile Safari just as intended.\n\nA: Open the 'File' menu in Chrome, choose 'Share', then 'AirDrop'.\n\n\nA: You could create a markdown file (.md extension) on macOS, paste in the URL, and AirDrop it to the device. Then on the device, accept the file and open with \"Notes\", which will contain a clickable URL.\nAlternatively, you could send a .webloc file by completing the below, but it opens a Safari preview within the \"Files\" application, rather than Safari itself (in iOS 12.2 at least). However, this process requires you to save the webloc file, which is a bit cumbersome to find/delete. Also, the Safari preview closes with upwards screen swipes.\n1.) Open AirDrop in finder\n2.)

I wanted to shrink the 1.5 TB to 1 TB. I used https://www.diskgenius.com/ to shrink the exFAT Partition which worked, I ended up with a 1 TB Partition visible in Windows. \nBut after attaching the external harddisk to Mac now the 500 GB encrypted Partition is not recognized anymore. Mac's disk utility still shows disk2s2 with 512 GB but is not able to mount it.\nMy guess is that this disk was GPT before but got overwritten with a MBR by disk genius and that there is now data missing for MacOS to recognize the disk. Is that possible?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any hope of recovering my data? Does HFS store some information needed for encryption in the GPT that might have been overwritten now?\n\n*Can I somehow force MacOS to mount disk2s2 as an encrypted HFS+ volume?\n\n*Does the GPT automatically get overwritten by MBR or is it possible that the MBR somehow just takes priority over the GPT and if the MBR gets deleted the GPT takes over again? Sorry if this is a dumb idea, I don't know much how these partitioning tables are stored on disk.\n\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nA: I managed to get my data back.\nAfter copying the harddisk to another one with dd to not cause any more damage I started to try to get it to work again. The solution turned out to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*change mbr back to gpt (used disk genius for that again, had to delete the first 200mb partition to be able to do that)\n\n*change the guid type of disk2s2 to corestorage using diskutil (set id=53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC)\n\n*boot again in macos and the volume was back\n\n\nIt took a lot longer because I expected that disk2s2 was a HFS+ encrypted volume but viewing it in a hex editor I didn't find the markers for that, so I thought my data somehow has been overwritten or that the partitions were not aligned properly anymore. Only after recreating my previous setup I found out that there was a CoreStorage layer in between and then it was an easy fix.\nStill not entirely sure what went wrong in the first place, because I tried to recreate my scenario on another harddisk and it worked there. My guess is my old harddisk had an mbr and gpt (hybrid) and thats what confused disk genius, but I don't know for sure.\n", "Q: What the difference and usage of encodings UTF-8 and UTF-8-MAC in iconv?

My new Macbook Pro has Touch ID, and I've trained it on one of my fingers so I can use it to unlock my machine, which is quite fun. I've been wondering, though, how secure it is really.\nTo be clear, since I must have already logged in using my password, and you have to be physically present before you can try using Touch ID, Apple doesn't have to guarantee that it will only respond to my finger; it just has to be very unlikely to respond to someone else's finger. That's why, from time to time, the OS will require that my full password be typed in. It's similar to ATM card PIN numbers; four digits makes it difficult enough for a card thief to guess that it's a good-enough confirmation measure, although it would NOT be good enough if the card weren't required.\nSo, here's my specific question: how likely is it that a random, non-trained finger would be recognized as matching my trained one? Are we talking a 1 in 1000 chance, 1 in 10000, or even less likely? (I doubt I'd get a clear answer from Apple were I to ask them...)\n\nA: Apple, iOS Security, November 2018, p. 10\n\nThe probability that a random person in the population could unlock\n  your iPhone is 1 in 50,000 with Touch ID or 1 in 1,000,000 with Face ID. This probability increases with multiple enrolled fingerprints (up to 1 in 10,000 with five fingerprints) or appearances (up to 1 in 500,000 with two appearances). For additional protection, both Touch ID and Face ID allow only five unsuccessful match attempts before a passcode is required to obtain access to your device.\n\n\nA: The main security concern of using biometrics is not the fact that they don't have enough entropy. \nThe main issue is that biometrics are not private i.e you literally show your face to everyone & leave your fingerprints on everything you touch.\nIts trivial for any forensic professional to dust your Macbook for prints & unlock it with the findings.\n", "Q: How to keep lock screen always on when connected to external monitor and charging I'm using a 3rd party utility to set very eye pleasing wallpapers on my 2013 MacBook Pro running macOS Mojave 10.14.2.

Mac Mini running Sierra.\nI have a 500GB internal drive, that was partitioned into two volumes because at one point I wanted to test upgrading from Mavericks to Sierra but wanted to make sure everything worked before I would commit to it.  Everything has been working for a long time now so I'd like to remove the \"old\" system and reclaim that space.\nMy Diskutil List showed both drives and their corresponding Recovery HD partitions.  I did a diskutil erasevolume on both the old system volume, and the old recovery HD.  They are now gone, and all that's left is my Sierra volume and its recovery HD.  But now I can't get the Mac to allow me to reclaim the old partition's space.\nHere is my current diskutil list:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            249.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS TM iMac                 8.0 TB     disk2s2\n\nI've tried diskutil resizevolume but every time I do I just get The new size must be different than the existing size despite specifying a different (larger) target size.\nAdditionally, in Disk Utility I cannot create a new additional partition anymore, as DU seems to think the entire available space is now only the 250GB of my Sierra partition.  Creating a new partition only eats into my 250GB partition's space.\nHow can I reclaim the missing half of my hard disk?\n\nA: I assume, to added Sierra, you shrunk the Mavericks volume and created the \"Macintosh HD\" volume for Sierra. Installing Sierra created the \"Recovery HD\" volume. When you deleted Maverick you created free space above the Sierra volume. You can not add this free space back to the Sierra volume. You can only add free space if the space is directly below an existing HFS, Core Storage or APFS volume.\nIf you want to confirm where the free space is, then here are a few ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*The sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command will show the logical sector blocks used by each partition. The command will also show the free space between each partition in logical sector block units. In the days of OS X, you could run this command on the boot drives. Starting with macOS, System Integrity Protection (SIP) has to be disabled to do this.\n\n*Use the diskutil info -plist disk0s# command to retrieve partition number # start and size byte values. You need to repeat the command for each partition on a drive. Next, you can compile a table similar to the output from the gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command. Basically, free space is any space not allocated to a partition, the Protected Master Boot Record (PMBR) and the GUID Partition Tables (GPT).\n\n*Write a BASH script that would automate way number 2.  A free script can be downloaded from this site. Assuming your downloads goto to the default Downloads folder, you can get the free space by entering the command shown below. Note: You do not need to enter sudo or disable SIP. \n~/Downloads/driveinfo-1.0.1/driveinfo -cbestin disk0\n\n\nFrankly, I do not know if driveinfo is compatible with Sierra. If driveinfo is not compatible you will just get an error message saying so.\n\nTo reclaim the space, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the Sierra volume using Time Machine or some other method. Erase you internal drive, create a new volume spanning the entire drive, then reload everything.\n\n*Use the gpt and newfs_hfs to create and format a new volume above the existing Sierra volume. You could then clone the Sierra volume to this new volume. I could post the steps for this, but I would first need the output from gpt -r show /dev/disk0 or ~/Downloads/driveinfo-1.0.1/driveinfo -cbestin disk0.\n\n\nA: Disclaimer: I don't fully understand how disk partitioning works, but after searching through a lot of answers, I took risks to do the following and it worked for me.\nBelow my Container disk1, there were 2 Apple_Boot disks.

It's tied to my Ringer and doesn't turn down when I connect my headphones meaning I have to mute it every time after I get scared by the keyboard sound and remember to unmute it afterwards!\n\nA: iPhones remember the volume settings for different sound outputs. ie. if you have the iPhone speakers, and a set of plugged in headphones, and a set of bluetooth headphones, and a wireless speaker the phone will remember the volume of each of them. When you connect the relevant device the volume is set to where you left it.\nIn this case you're connecting your headphones and it's setting back to where you left it.\nIn addition, Sony have a Headphones Connect app that can you can use to set presets for different scenarios.

I'm thinking of buying a MBP base model for Swift programming, and I know that Xcode has a simulator for the touch-bar, but do I need the one with actual touchID hardware if I want my app to require a biometrical login? or is there a way to debug and test it without needing it; same as the touchID with iOS?\nSo do I need the one with touch-bar and touchID for this purpose? And also will I need it in future?\nAppreciate any help.\n\nA: No, you do not need it to develop such applications. However you do need a Mac with Touch ID in order to completely test that feature. There’s no simulator in Xcode for macOS applications with Touch ID as such.\nUsually it is not really necessary to actually test Touch ID though. It is a single line change to swap out Touch ID with local authentication so that you can test with passwords until you are satisfied that works, and then change it to Touch ID.\nNo one can know if you need this in the future. The future is, after all, still undecided.\n", "Q: The recovery server could not be contacted while installing Mojave Just needed a bit of help debugging. \nThis is a machine that came with Yosemite OS and I had updated to Mojave.

Many web sites suggest to tap the very top of the screen (the status bar) but that does not work. It just shows the URL entry field and the tab \"ears\". I also tried double tapping. Nothing seems to work.\nI have iOS 12.1.1\n(I'm also interested in a solution for iPhone. There the \"tap the status bar\" seems  to work sometimes, but many times it does not)\n\nA: Tapping the status bar is the system-wide scroll to top.\nIf the location bar in Safari is collapsed, the first tap anywhere in that area is overridden to expand the bar. If this happens on the first tap, now tap the status bar area.\nThe tap to scroll to the top only works when the location bar is expanded.

However, I recently got an email that I actually DIDNT sign up for a time slot and I’ve therefore lost the opportunity. I must have failed to click confirm! \nSo my question is, how do I prove that I visited the sign-up page on the 12 or 13th of December? I’ve checked my browser history for Safari and Firefox from those days, but for some reason the website is not in there—is it possible that it got inadvertently deleted? I know that I visited the pages and that I was not in private browsing mode. \nA couple of specific questions:\n1. What are your suggestions in terms of finding the missing browsing history in my Mac? I’m running OS Mountain Lion and I didn’t have Time Machine running. I have found my history.plist file, but it seems really short and only seems to have websites that visited in the past couple days. \n\n\n*Is there any way that cookies might help me? I unfortunately don’t think that the university’s site collects them, and I didn’t see the site in my safari cookies, but might this be an avenue to pursue?\n\n*Is there anything that the university might be able to do to check website activity? I’ve sent them my IP address, but I’m worried that it may have changed since 10 days ago and won’t match. Is there anything else I can ask them to do? \n\n*Anything else in terms of proving that I thought I had signed up? The only thing I have right now is that I entered the interview time slot into my iCalendar as soon as I signed up, so the time stamp on the item in my calendar matches the day. \nI appreciate any help you can give, and let me know if I should provide any more information! I desperately want the chance to interview at this school! \n\nA: \n10 days ago...immediately signed up for a time slot on their\n  website...how do I prove that I visited the sign-up page on the 12 or\n  13th of December?\n\nHistory\nSafari keeps history in a database that's capped at 80M.  That's quite literally a metric ton of browsing you would have to do in the span of 10 days for the history to be over written.  If you're not seeing it in your history, and especially if there are older entries, it wasn't deleted from your history, it just simply isn't there.\nThere are two more places you can look:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cookies - ~/Library/Cookies\n\n*Cache - ~/Libary/Caches/com.apple.Safari\nCookies\nIf the site you went to had a form that you were filling out, chances are they were using cookies (if just to identify your session).  Search in your cookies cache directory for anything that potentially matches the site you were on.  Listing this directory will show all the cookies stored in your user profile:\n$ ls ~/Library/Cookies\n\nCaches\nYou can search the Caches to see if anything was stored during that time.  Using a similar method to the link above to search for cookies, create a text file called commands.txt (in your caches directory) with the following:\n.mode csv\n.once caches.txt\nselect time_stamp, request_key from cfurl_cache_response where time_stamp BETWEEN date('2018-12-11') AND date('2018-012-14');\n\nThen issue the command:\n$ sqlite3 Cache.db < commands.txt\n\nIf there's anything in that time period that matches your site, then you have \"evidence\" that you were there.\nConclusion\nI don't see how this can help you in your situation.  This data is useful if a manager was trying to prove that you were somewhere (a website) where/when you shouldn't have been, for example.  However, you being at a particular website at a particular time doesn't negate the fact that the required task wasn't completed.\nThis is like standing in line for days to be the first to buy the very first iPhone ever made only to not pay for it.  It doesn't matter that you were there and you may even have pictures of you holding it; you didn't do the critical part and actually complete the transaction.\n", "Q: play-with-mpv python server problem I'm used to use Play with MPV Chrome extension on Arch linux which works also on MacOS.

I have a 2013 iMac (27\" 3.5GHz i7, model id iMac14,2, EMC 2639) that has a Fusion drive. I want to replace the Fusion's internal HDD with an SSD. My understanding is that I should split the Fusion drive before performing this.\nI referred to the article https://www.macworld.com/article/2015664... which discusses the use of diskUtil and Core Storage to get the GUIDs and split the drive.\nHowever, invoking disktutil coreStorage list returned ‘No CoreStorage logical volume groups found’.

The act of changing the hardware will 'break' the logical volume, and the OS will then treat the two devices as separate.\nYou will have to erase/re-partition the remaining device.\nOf course, splitting the Fusion Drive in this way will render the data on it inaccessible, so you must have a backup to restore your data to each volume as you wish.\n", "Q: iMac 14,2 crashing after 10.14.2 upgrade Just upgraded to 10.14.2 and my iMac won't stay up for more than a few minutes.

I'm mainly posting this before I go to all the trouble of assuming it's bad memory or something and not a bug in Mojave.\n\nA: This problem was addressed by upgrading the OS. I'm at 10.14.5 now and no longer have these problems.\n", "Q: Finder froze when copying large folder I have a 1TB hard drive which I need to backup the info, so I copied all folders into another drive (4 TB) and after a full day of copying progress the Finder appears this way:\n\nSo it says \"About 5 seconds remaining...\" and the actual free size of the 4TB drive tells me the files are there, but as you can see in the picture most of the folders are greyed out, like if they were not there.\nI want to know what can I do, someone knows what happens if I cancel the transfer?\n\nA: As far as what happens after you cancel the transfer, I'd surmise that it would, like it says, cancel the transfer. Items already copied may remain, items that were in the progress of being copied will be removed, a process which may take a significant amount of time in itself.\nIf your intent is to copy/move a Time Machine backup so that it remains functional in its new location, the system has many idiosyncrasies you need to work around.\nJames Pond maintained a website which was a fantastic source of reference on the \"gory details\" of Time Machine (in his own words); he has since passed away, and the information is slowly becoming outdated, but much of it is still relevant. You can still access it on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.\nSince you are trying to back up the entire drive, I think following these instructions would be better than trying to copy every single item file by file:\n\nCopy LOCAL backups from one volume to another LOCAL VOLUME\n\n*\n  \n*Format the new drive/partition, with either the GUID or APM Partition Map Scheme, and the exact same Format as the old backups. See  question #5 if you need detailed instructions.\n  \n*Connect both drives to your Mac, via separate ports if possible, then open a Finder window. Make sure both volumes are shown in the sidebar (if not, from the Menubar select Preferences > Sidebar, and check the box to show External disks in the sidebar). Leave the Finder window open.\n  \n*Start Disk Utility, select anything in the sidebar, and click the Restore tab.\n  \n*Drag the old volume to the Source box, and the new volume to the Destination box.\n  \n*Check the Erase destination box, then the Restore button. This will take a long time.\n  \n*When the duplication is complete, note that Disk Utility has changed the name of the destination volume to be the same as the source.  You do not want to leave it that way, so immediately rename one of them.  In the sidebar of the Finder window opened above, control-click (right-click) the one you want to rename.  When done, look back at the Disk Utility display to be sure you renamed the right one, then quit Disk Utility.\n\n", "Q: How do I delete a book from iBooks on Mac Book Pro How do I delete a book from iBooks on MBP OSX.\n\nA: \nIn your library, select the book you want to delete, then press the Delete key.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/books/delete-books-from-your-mac-ibks67184a3a/mac\n", "Q: Can’t mount external drive - Mojave came up here after a lot of looking around.

Tks! – Stumped 6 mins ago   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: From Terminal, what happens if you try:\nsudo diskutil repairVolume disk2s2\nsudo diskutil mount disk2s2\n\nThis will run the Disk Utility disk repair process. Can you report back with any errors or output you get.\nYou can also try booting into Single User Mode (at start-up hold down Command-S). That'll drop you into a command-prompt and you can try\nsudo fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk2s2\nshutdown -r now\n\nThat runs a filesystem check (hence fsck), and can also repair damage, then reboots. After the reboot, check and see if it mounts.\n", "Q: HomeBrew offloading package compilation My poor old 2008 aluminium MacBook isn't the only old piece of kit I have running homebrew packages, I really appreciate the ability to have a package manager in Mac OS, at least while I make my way to linux. However, even my 2014 iMac is feeling some weight from Homebrew package management. It's slow although very automated, I would like to speed things up a little on my older computers. \nIs there any way, that the source code for packages like youtube-dl, aircrack-ng, or most non-bottled packages could be pre-compiled and installed as a binary file for Mac OS / OS X? Or at the very least, something similar to a .deb file (like a bottle), where the source code has been compiled and it's left to the system to appropriately decompress and copy files and libraries to their appropriate locations? Thanks! \n\nA: By default, packages are installed in the way you describe... \"Bottles\" are precompiled binaries downloaded as compressed tape archives, the contents of which are then \"poured\" into the appropriate paths.\nIf you specify options, or use custom compile flags, then naturally brew will build from source. But if you for example, brew install nmap htop bmon, it will download the bottle for your system version and pour it along with any missing dependencies.\nThat being said, there are definitely situations where brew compiles from source, so to try to answer your question, how often is it that you find this a problem?\nThere's no way to set it up so that brew compiles on a different machine \"automagically\" (that is, unless you implement this as a feature and implement it into your installation of brew). You can imagine how this could be difficult; architecture differences aside, conflicts/dependencies needing to be resolved, the differences in environment, etc. would make this a nightmare.\nIf this is more of an occasional annoyance than a regular problem, what you might want to try is install whatever formula you want on the faster machine with --build-bottle. Then you can \"bottle\" the package yourself by running brew bottle to install on the slower machine.\nI can't recommend this with any level of confidence though, since I don't know how well it would work for all formulae. You would need to be on the same OS/architecture, and the binaries will be compiled for the lowest common denominator CPU (unless you specify which one) so the build might perform worse, depending on which features it was designed to use.\nIf the difference in compilation time is so large that this seems like a viable route, the two machines might not even be compatible (I don't remember what the 2008 MacBook was, core 2?), and cross-compiling within brew would be a whole separate headache all on its own, you might be better off just not using a package manager at all and compiling/configuring the software yourself.\n", "Q: Can't use CMD+V Shortcut to copy paste into certain apps, but right click menu works fine In iMessage, the Mail app and Slack, if I copy an image to clipboard, then use Cmd+V to paste it into an active iMessage conversation, nothing happens. However, in apps like Discord or Firefox, this works fine.\nHowever, if I click Edit -> Paste or right click the message box and click paste, it appears. It's really frustrating to have Cmd+V not work. Does anyone know why? It's always been this way, since I bought this Macbook earlier this year, refurbished.\nMBP 13 inch using MacOS Mojave\n\nA: With help from @user3052786 , I've found the issue.\nThe reason why many (but not all) apps were failing to paste with the shortcut (but Edit menu -> Paste or Right click -> Paste worked fine) is because I previously followed the following tutorial on how to make my clipboard content attempt to match the output document's text style on paste.\nhttps://havecamerawilltravel.com/photographer/set-paste-match-style-default-mac-osx/\nI did this because I was using OneNote for Mac and pasting a lot of content between different documents for note-taking.\nThe fix: Simply remove the 'CMD+V -> Paste and Match Style' mapping from Keyboard shortcuts in MacOS Settings, as shown in reverse by the tutorial.\n", "Q: Transfer iPhone contents to iTunes How do I transfer the contents of my iPhone to iTunes before I get a new iPhone?

They are not in recently deleted My sister has lost upwards of 400 pictures in an accidental deleting spree. She deleted the photos from her iPhone and it chose to delete it from iCloud too, which is not a big deal in itself, but they are not in recently deleted. We have 10 days to figure it out, please help!\n\nA: Did your sister try logging into iCloud.com to check whether there are some deleted pictures? Use the Apple ID and Passwords to login the website to get it.\nIf you can't get it from the iCloud.com and the \"recently deleted\", it's hard to find them back unless you've ever created an iPhone backup. You know the photos that you don't sync to iCloud can be saved to iTunes Backup or iCloud backup. Just restore your device will bring them all back.  \n\nA: If the photo's that are trying to be recovered are taken on a different device make sure iCloud photos are turned on in settings:\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\nGo to Settings > [your name] > iCloud.\nTap Photos.\nTurn on iCloud Photos.\nOn your Mac:\nGo to System Preferences > iCloud.\nNext to Photos, click Options. \nSelect iCloud Photos.\n  After you turn on iCloud Photos, you might need to connect to Wi-Fi\n  and wait a few minutes. Then look for your photos again.\nShown below:\n\n\nFrom Get help with missing photos\nMake sure that you are also signed in with the same Apple ID.\n\nUnhide your photos:\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:\nOpen the Photos app and go to the Albums tab.\nTap Hidden under Other Albums.\nSelect the photo or video that you want to unhide.\nTap share icon > Unhide.\nOn your Mac:\nOpen Photos and in the menu bar, click View > Show Hidden Photo Album.\nIn the left sidebar, select Hidden.\nSelect the photo or video that you want to unhide.\nControl-click the photo, then choose Unhide Photo. You can also choose\n  Image > Unhide Photo from the menu bar, or press Command-L.\nIf you use iCloud Photos, the photos that you hide on one device are\n  hidden on your other devices too.\n\nIf you organize a photo or video into an album and then delete it from\nPhotos, it will delete everywhere, including your album.\n", "Q: How can I move videos from Google Drive to Apple Photos on iPad? My uncle has a lot of videos in Google Drive on his iPad. In Google Drive i can’t find a way to export/save to Photos. I can only move to another Google drive but not onto the native Photos app. Is there a way?\n\nA: From this Google article:\n\nOpen the Google Drive app.\nNext to the file you want to download, tap More.\nTap Send a copy.\nDepending on your file, tap Save image or Save video.\n\nIf you want to save multiple at once you will need to move the files to Google Photos and have them in a folder.\nThen:\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad, open the Google Drive app.\nTap Menu and then Settings.\nUnder Google Photos, turn on Auto Add.

Due to the nature of my work, I need as much of this space available at all times.\nI will sporadically need 100+ GB for a short duration of time for example. The problem with iCloud is that it optimises so to store as much as possible on the Mac at anytime and this causes me problems. Yes it will delete some local content when I am short on space but it takes too long.\nI want iCloud switched on and accessible from my Mac, I just want it to keep everything on iCloud. Why does this not seem to be a feature or am I missing something?\nIt seems to leave me with 25 GB, which is 10% available so maybe this is a setting?\n\nA: You can right-click any folder in iCloud and choose Remove Download.\nThe content will persist in iCloud and be removed from your local Mac, freeing local disk space. You can do this high in the hierarchy to remove lots of content at once.\nThis won't apply to new content, so this process will have to be repeated if you're running out of disk space again.\n\nA: You can buy additional storage, but this will not help you in your case. Documents in iCloud are always synced with your Mac, so anything you remove on your Mac will also be removed from iCloud. \nYou need to look into other cloud storage solutions (eg Dropbox with selective syncing) if you want to temporarily want to offload something into the cloud. Or buy an external drive (which may be simpler). \n", "Q: How do I get my Downloads files back on my Mac? I didn't lose the Downloads folder, just the files. When I clicked inside the folder, poof!

So macOs just lied to me. I went into storage and recommendations. \nAnd saw this \n\nWhich clearly says store all files photos and messages in iCloud and save space on Mac automatically when it's needed.\nAs soon as I accepted this recommendation what it actually did is this \n\nWhich reads quite the opposite \"The full contents of iCloud drive will be stored on this mac\" ?!?!?! \nI managed to turn it off but now I have these massive downloads pending and not doing anything. \n\nHow do I remove them?\n\nA: From this article:\n\nClick the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac's screen.\nClick System Preferences in the drop down menu.\nClick on iCloud.\nClick on Options next to iCloud Drive.\nClick to uncheck the checkbox for Desktop & Documents Folders.\n\nAlternatively, try signing out of iCloud.\n\nA: You can't change how this works with the controls available in iOS 12 and macOS 10.14.\nThe \"when space is needed\" literally means you get the files if you are signed in.\nOnly when the storage is starting to get full, do the reclamation and offloading processes start.\nAlso - don't assume the file sizes you see are true. Finder shows the size of the cloud file - not the amount that's locally downloaded. Look for a tool like Daisy Disk to show you actual allocations and not Finder or System Information.\nFinder shows you stub files that allow spotlight to index and the cloud download to trigger a request to get data from iCloud CDN and you'll have these stub files stored in ~/Library and then injected into the directory hierarchy. The details change a bit from version to version - so technical articles from 6 months or 12 months ago are now wrong which might add to any confusion we all are experiencing.\n\nA: The important part here is if you have enough space. What you are seeing are not downloads, but files stored in iCloud that will be stored locally only if enough space is available on your local drive.\nThe whole point of it is that you don‘t have to worry about it, so unless you suspect something wrong you can just leave it and let macOS do it‘s thing :-)\n\nA: Unfortunately, it's not possible to pick and choose which files you would like to offload, as this is done automatically.\n", "Q: Search for emails within specific folders Presently, if I do a search in Apple Mail it searches everything. This is fine most of the time, but sometimes I want to just be able to select a folder and then search only the emails in that folder.\nHow can I search for emails only within a folder?\n\nA: This is definitely possible, but there's a trick to it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly you need to ensure you have your Favourites Bar visible\n\n*Secondly you need to have the folder added to the Favourites Bar\n\n\nSee the screenshot below for what I mean by the Favourites Bar:\n\nYou can make this bar appear/disappear with the optionshiftcommandH keyboard shortcut.\nNow, to add a folder (or smart folder) to the bar, just drag it into the bar. In the screenshot above you'll see I've added the Last Month, This Year and other Smart Folders to my bar.\nNow, after entering a search term in your Search field, just select one of the folders in your Favourites Bar and it'll filter the search to those items located within the folder.\n\nA: From this Apple Discussion:\n\nWhen you start a search field, the Favorites bar should appear if you\n  don't have it shown always. You can select the mailbox to search from\n  there. If one isn't on the Favorite bar, drag that mailbox to the bar\n  to show it there.\nTo always show Favorites bar, click View in the menu, then Show\n  Favorites Bar.\nYou can also select and highlight the mailbox in the sidebar you want\n  to search, then enter criteria in the search field.\n\n", "Q: MacOS, how to get folder size (physical size on disk) Ok so I have a large folder on disk see the image below\n\nYou can see it says the size of the folder is 8.46GB however this is mostly source code, and I think file system will be using file compression under the hood. I'd expect this folder to compress very well, so my question is this. \"How can I find out how much actual physical space this folder is using?\"\nThanks \n\nA: You should go to the terminal and from the terminal cd to the folder you want to get the size of. Once there type: du -h. The last number it prints is the directory size.\n", "Q: How can I remove 'Dark Mode' from Ms Office apps without disabling it across macOS? I am running macOS Mojave and have Dark Mode set as my default appearance in Apple > System Preferences > General.\nI recently updated MS Office on my Mac and the latest MS Office update (i.e. version 16.20) supports Dark Mode. However, unlike many other apps, there is no way to enable/disable this appearance within the app itself.\nSince I much prefer the usual appearance of my MS Office apps, but still want to use Dark Mode within macOS, how can I achieve this outcome? \n\nA: To disable Dark Mode for MS Office only, you need to run a terminal command for each of the MS Office apps in question.\nFor example, if you wish to disable dark mode in MS Excel, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Excel if it’s running\n\n*Launch Terminal (usually found in the Applications/Utilities folder)\n\n*Enter (or copy and paste) the following command: defaults write com.microsoft.Excel NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool yes\n\n*Now press return\n\n*Enter (or copy and paste) the following command:  killall cfprefsd\n\n*Now press return\nNow when you launch MS Excel it should appear as it it normally would without Dark Mode enabled.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*To do this with the other MS Office apps, just change the command at Step 3 so that it’s referencing the app in question.\n\n*Each of the app names within the command must start with an uppercase letter (note the uppercase 'E' for Excel in the command at Step 3.\n\n*For PowerPoint, the app name must be spelt as follows: Powerpoint (i.e. only the first P is in uppercase, not both Ps)\n\n*To revert back to Dark Mode, follow the same steps but end the command at Step 3 with no instead of yes.\n\n\nA: An alternative would be to use an app called lights off or Night Owl.\nThese both provide the option to turn off dark mode for specific apps:\n\nWith LightsOff you can easily and quickly switch between light and dark mode and even specify what mode you want on a per app basis. \n\nThis provides a checkbox interface where you toggle modes in all apps:\n\n", "Q: How can I stop iCloud downloading files to my Mac Ok, I am getting really annoyed with macOS now, so I asked this question\nHow can I clear pending iCloud Downloads?\nand the answer worked! Great!\nHowever after signing out of iCloud and signing back in this time with documents switched off and Optimise switched off, my Mac is still insisting on downloading my documents folder!\n\nAs you can see from the image both Desktop and documents is not selected, Optimise is unchecked and yet you can see it is still downloading 44GB of data I don't want on my mac! Thats why I bought the external storage plan! \nWhy? This is driving me crazy!!\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Finder. \n\n*Click on iCloud Drive. \n\n*Right-click on the folder you want to remove its downloaded content, and then click on Remove Download. \n\n\nHowever, you wouldn't see the \"Remove Download\" option for app folders. For instance, as in your image, you can't right-click on the Numbers folder and then click on Remove Download.\nInstead, you have to open the Numbers folder, and then right-click on all the files and folders inside it to remove all its downloaded content from your Mac.\n\nA: *\n\n*In your finder app, go to the sidebar to iCloud Drive and hover over the download cake diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n*The icon will change to an ⓘ\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click on the ⓘ and a small pop up will open showing you the current download status\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now just click the ⓧ and you're done\n\n\nA: have same problem.\nThe x button is not clickable\n\nAs you can see, those downloads generate a lot of traffic.\nAnd if I (right) click on files or folders and choose \"Remove Download\" - it removes files locally (which is great!) with only one exception: it starts to download files again very next day.\nAlready tried to turn of icloud sync with my Mac and as soon I added it back - it started to download files. Yesterday it finished downloading and I removed local copies. Today the download started back.\nI don't understand why it's so, I don't want to keep local copies. If I will need a file from icloud I will click \"download now\" and that's it.\nOS: Big Sur 11.2.2\nUPDATE:\nWhat helped me to get rid of constant re-uploads/re-downloads was this:\ncd ~/Library/Application\\ Support\nkillall bird && rm -rf CloudDocs\n\nIt is another issue solving but helped me as well: https://superuser.com/questions/1045791/icloud-drive-sync-stuck\n\nA: I think that dialog you have up is pretty clear but based on the last question I would encourage a couple changes in how you're using iCloud.\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for words like \"if there is space\" in the description. That means Apple downloads everything and then frees up space when it sees you have little space left. It doesn't do the calculation first - it actually downloads.\n\n*Look for confusion around Documents and Desktop. If you opt in to syncing on one Mac - now you have 4 folders on any one Mac signed in to iCloud - the cloud version of desktop and documents and the local version.\n\n\nTo clean things up, you will want to sign in to https://www.icloud.com/#iclouddrive and delete anything you don't want syncing down in the short term.\nThen you'll want to let the machine get in balance with iCloud (which can take hours if you are in the 200 GB storage size for iCloud - even if you have a local caching server on your network) and then revisit the settings and adjust your plans.\nJust be sure to store files outside the buckets that sync locally and I think you'll be able to have iCloud storage for things you don't want on your Mac. I'm quite happy with 200 GB in the cloud for the past three years and three Mac with 256 SSD. My Photos library is now at 120 GB alone so my one device that downloads the full versions of everything so I can make a separate backup has that photo library on an external drive and not the 256 SSD. Everything else fits on the boot drive and the thinning process is quite solid.\nI expect I'll add another 50 GB of photos and tip over to needing an even larger cloud subscription and I think I can keep all my iOS and macOS devices using 256 SSD or less even as my total storage grows.\n\nA: The Documents folder in your screenshot is simply a regular folder in iCloud Drive. The checkbox you are referring to syncs the Documents and Desktop folders on your Mac with corresponding folders in iCloud Drive.\nUnchecking the documents folder button simply gives you a separate local Documents folder. It doesn't delete or alter the files you've already synced to the cloud. If you don't want those files in iCloud, simply move them out of iCloud or delete them.\n\nA: All you need to do is right click on a folder in icloud using finder, takes a second. Right click on the folder and select \"remove download\".\nThis simple way icloud storage works as everyone always wanted it to work.\n", "Q: How to open a folder in Finder by a single mouse click? (using Icon view) Is there a setting, key combination or similar to open a folder/subfolder in Finder with a single mouse click ?  I need a general solution which works on any folder in effort to minimize needless clicking ... that tiny triangle aside the folder icon will work yet its just too small and only appears using list view ... inspired by same behavior on osx inside a browser to hold down command key and single click a web link ... forcing users to double click is so 20th Century\nIs there a way to enable this on macOS (High Sierra or higher)?\nOn ubuntu this single click preference is a simple setting ;-)\n\nA: This is not possible natively in macOS\nWhile you may be able to assign a double click mouse action or a keyboard shortcut (CommandO) to your mouse but using something like AppleScript (i.e this answer and this answer) or USB Overdrive there is one main obstacle that must be overcome - the lack of hover to select.\nHowever, there is an App called DwellClick which is designed to automate your mouse clicking for you.  They have a feature called \"point to click\" which will select an item if you leave your pointer on it for a specified amount of time.   After which you can click with a reassigned mouse button to emulate double click.\n\nA: I agree with you on double click.  I bought a multi-key mouse.  I assign a key to double click. Not a perfect or free solution, but better.\n", "Q: 27\" Apple Cinema Display (video and power) to one USB-C I've got an Apple Cinema Display with ThunderBolt-2 and MagSafe-1 connector and would love to combine these two cables to one ThunderBolt-3 to supply power to the Mac and video and sound to the display on one cable.\nThe TB-2 on the outside is connected to a TB-2 port on the inside.\nThe MagSafe-1 disconnected to two \"pins\" GND and Voltage on the inside.\nThere are TB-2 to TB-3 adapters (e.g. Apple) on the market. Is there a way to connect the \"power pins\" to the TB2-3-adapter and solve my problem?\n(I've done a lot of soldering and working with Arduino etc.)\n\nA: \nIs there a way to connect the \"power pins\" to the TB2-3-adapter and\n  solve my problem?\n\nNo.  This can't be done.\nThis is not a matter of just dumping in some power on some of the pins.  Thunderbolt 3 supplies USB 3.1 signaling which conforms to the power delivery specification.  Meaning, power is negotiated between the two devices for up to 100W (20V at 5A); it's not simply supplying a set voltage (5V) at a maximum amperage of 3A (USB 2.0 spec).  \n\nFrom the image above VBUS (power) is provided on pins A4, A9, B4, B9.  However, it's not a constant, it's negotiated over the CC bus (CC1 and CC2).  By hard soldering in the power (16 to 20V DC) from the Magsafe, you could potentially fry equipment that's not expecting (or requesting) that much voltage.\n", "Q: PDF only readable with Acrobat on macOS and iOS I'm frequently given PDFs with images where the images are not (or not properly) rendered on macOS (or iOS), but which others say that they can read on other OSs. These files are always readable in Acrobat, but the Images do not show in any other app or browser (neither Preview nor Skim or PDF Expert).\nFrom asking around it's clear that I'm not the only person with this issue. \nWhat's going on here and how can I, or the creators of the PDFs, fix it?\n\nA: iOS\nUsing the example PDF in the comment below I was able to confirm that some images do not display correctly on my iPad:\nCompare the \"sidebar\" images on page 12-14 for some that are either missing entirely or display incorrectly.\nCompare this:\n\nTo this:\n\nHowever, they were able to be viewed using PDF Viewer Pro by PSPDFKit \n(Note: I tested using the free version of the app. There are additional features available as an in-app purchase but they are not needed to view these images.)\nUnfortunately I was not able to get PDF Viewer Pro to export the PDF into a more 'universal' PDF.\nMac\nWhen I opened the same PDF in Preview on my Mac (running High Sierra), it appeared to show the images just fine, even the ones that did not appear correctly in iOS, so I'm not sure why you're having issues viewing it on macOS, unless you are using an earlier version?\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone prompting me to install an update meant for iPhone XS? I am using an iPhone 7 in Turkey. My iPhone is prompting me to install a software update which appears to be meant for iPhone XS.\nIs this normal? I just want to make sure my iPhone isn't hacked and is behaving as expected.\n\n\nA: This is not an indication of an hacked iPhone at all.\nThe screenshot contains a description of the bugfixes included in a new iOS update from Apple. You do not get a personal description of only the changes that are important to you, rather they write one description that everyone gets.\nFor example: If you happen to be using an iPhone XR in Turkey, this change is important to you. If you don't - just ignore it.\nIn general updates could contain more fixes than the ones that are explicitly highlighted, so you'll want to install them even though the explicitly detailed ones aren't applicable to you.\n", "Q: Get per process user and system CPU time on OSX via command line?

I have an iPod running on iOS 5 and and iPhone running on iOS10. I backed up my iPhone to my computer (Mac OS) using iTunes. I made sure that the apps were on the Mobile Applications folder. I then connected the iPhone to the computer, opened iTunes and found the apps I wanted to install. A \"Will Install\" notice appeared next to the apps and I synced the iPhone. When the syncing was finished, the apps were installed on the iPhone, but the game progress was lost. Why are the games scored not transfered to the iPhone? Can they be transfered though iCloud?  \nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\nEdit - In response to @fsb: This happens with all the games on the iPhone (Bravesmart, Cut the Rope, Where´s My Water, Angry Birds, etc.).  As for contacting the developers, I have not done so thus far. \n\nA: Scores are not stored into the app, so the apps backed up into your iTunes doesn't have your scores.\nIn order to share scores between different devices, I think that developers are usually using iCloud Drive (only available since iOS 8) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204230\nBut older games was using Game Center to share scores, so you will probably be able to share them through this one.\nhttps://www.imore.com/game-center\n", "Q: My iPhone show delivered for hours for a message, then shows read but read from hours before I sent a message to a contact at 2:46 PM, and for hours it showed delivered.

Does anyone know why that would happen?\n\nA: A common cause for this is simply that the contact received the message, but didn't have enough signal (cell or WiFi connectivity, or phone in flight mode, or similar) to be able to send the read-receipt back. \nThe read-receipt then comes through much later when the phone regains its connection with Apple's servers.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra, Messages won't search at all I just got a new 2018 Macbook Pro, so I'm in the process of migrating from my 2013 MBP to the new one.  I don't trust the Migration Assistant due to numerous bad past experiences, so I do this kind of thing manually.\nTo move my Messages content over, I copied the entire ~/Library/Messages/ directory over to the new machine, and Messages generally seems to work fine - all my messages are there, Text Forwarding from my phone works, etc.  The one thing that doesn't work, is search.  I can't search for anything at all, no matter what it is.  100% of attempted searches results in \"No Results Found\".\nIs this a Spotlight issue?

Since I switched mobile providers, I can no longer use my iPhone as a personal Hotspot. The company doesn't allow it, and I didn't realize how convenient it was until I no longer had it.\nI used to connect my iPad (Wi-Fi only) to my personal hotspot. Since I am no longer able to do that, I am wondering if I could buy a mobile hotspot and use it in a similar manner?\nI've never really given it a thought as to how all the connections are made between devices. I'm guessing that the iPad + iPhone connection works differently. The iPhone is not offering the iPad a 4G/LTE connection, is it? I'm thinking that since the iPad can't access the cellular network, then it won't work with the mobile hotspot.\nSince I am not sure what type of connection the iPhone and the mobile hotspot offer to a another device like a tablet, I'm really clueless as to whether or not it would work.\n\nA: Yes, you can definitely use a mobile hotspot with the iPad. Make sure you get a version that connects with devices over WiFi, and you’ll be fine! (I.e. do not get a dongle that needs to be plugged into USB).\nThe connection process is slightly different than with an iPhone. It isn’t automatic, so you need to open Settings and look for the hotspot under WiFi and enter the password.\nThe only thing you’ll miss in comparison to the iPhone tethering is that the iPhone lets the iPad use its GPS for location updates. A mobile hotspot does not in the same manner give access to precise locations. Usually this is not a problem at all, unless you specifically want to use the iPad for navigation (GPS routing / mapping).\n", "Q: Deploy iOS app on personal devices I've been working on a small iOS app, intended as a gift to some family members. To my dismay, I'm finding a lot of barriers to attempting to deploy the app. It largely revolves around signing the app to actually be runnable on devices in question, which aren't rooted/jailbroken, and don't have any other particular reason to be.\nFrom my research thus far, I've gathered that the free provisioning Apple provides for can only produce certificates valid for 7 days. Since the app depends on persisted, user-generated data, even were the recipients willing to reinstall every week this would still be a non-starter. On top of that, the Apple ID associated with said devices is a very old ID that a known issue has Xcode being unable to verify the ID. So the free provisioning is not an option.\nTo an extent I'm balking at the Apple Developer Program subscription fees. However, I'm wondering whether that would even fix the issue? Is there a method within the (paid) Apple Developer Program to deploy directly to local iOS devices, for long-term use, without publishing to the App Store or going through any sort of approval process with Apple? Is this supported by the Ad Hoc deployment provisions of the program? And in that case, would there be a way for an installation of the app to be able to survive later ceasing to renew the Developer Program subscription?\nI'd really appreciate if there were a way to deploy as such for free that can work with a legacy Apple ID, but I've already gotten the impression that's not the case - correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nA: If you're willing to pay the 99$ yearly Apple Developer Program enrollment fee, the easiest option for you would be to use \"Ad-hoc Distribution\". This is slighly more involved than TestFlight, but will allow your users to use the app for a full year instead of 90 days.\nEssentially you need to get the UDID (unique ID number visible in iTunes or on the device) for each of the devices that you want to deploy to. You add those UDIDs to in the Developer Portal and then you sign the app with your certificate and add your provisioning profile with the UDIDs in (these steps are automatically done by Xcode). It is really much simpler than it sounds like.\nYou can then install the app on all the devices for which you had UDIDs. They will last a year before you need to renew your enrollment in the developer program.\nNote that you do not need the Apple-IDs used on the devices you want to deploy on (in contrary to TestFlight). Therefore you will not have the same problems with Apple-IDs here.\nAnother option is to use the more expensive (299$) Enterprise Program (note that you need to own or otherwise be entitled to sign for a business to enroll). Here the signing certificate is valid for 3 years, however the actual provisioning profile still expires after 1 year. So you would need to pay the fee every year, and users will need to be online to renew the profile, etc.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro's battery charging only to 27% I have a 2017 15\" MacBook Pro.\nA while ago I posted question related to issues with battery here:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook 15\" (2017) - Battery Charging Problem\nWhat's funny is that that problem solved itself eventually (The next day it charged as expected). Two weeks later I kinda got into the same problem, but now it charges only to 27%.\nInterestingly, I don't have any performance problems if I am on battery and the battery usage is normal.\nIf someone has experienced similar problems, I am curious to know if they have done something to fix it. I have tried resetting the SMC multiple times but to no avail.\n\nA: According to this Apple Support page:\n\nOccasionally, the battery might not show a full charge (100%) in\n  macOS, even after the power adapter has been connected for an extended\n  period of time. The battery might appear to stop charging between 93\n  percent and 99 percent. This behavior is normal and will help to\n  prolong the overall life of the battery.\n\nBut 27% is quite low.\nAdditionally, you can try checking the battery cycle count. The average for your Mac is 1000.\nFrom this article:\n\nFollow these steps to access information about your Mac notebook\n  battery, including its cycle count:\nHold the Option key and click the Apple menu. Choose System\n  Information.\nUnder the Hardware section of the System Information window, select Power. The current cycle count is listed under the Battery Information section.\n\n\n", "Q: Is it now possible to spy on other person's iPhone using microphone? There is this app on the Appstore \"Find My Kid\" and \"Chat with parents\". They allow to the first app to start listening to microphone of the second app even without notification. Even when the app is in the background and the screen is off. \nSo I wonder: How does the app do this?\n\nA: I think the incorrect part of your question is the word 'spy'.  No, it's not possible to spy or listen to an iPhone's microphone without a notification or without the users consent.\nI'm not a developer of these apps but I am an iOS developer with a few apps in the App Store so I'm familiar with the iPhone's API's and App Store review process.  Apple does not provide a way to secretly listen to another device\nFrom reading their product page description, the 'listening' is done using a chat application or Messages.  The app starts recording and then sends the recording to the parents via chat.  It might work different in Android but for iOS that's what it looks like it's doing.  The image below specifically calls out \"Android/GPS watch\".\n\n(source: findmykids.org)\nThere doesn't appear to be anything 'secret' or in violation of Apple's app guidelines in these apps.  The wording on the app's App Store description is vague regarding how they do what they claim.\n\nA: Despite not being an iOS native app developer a quick google shows that the combination of the microphone permission with the (static) background execution audio permission allows an app to record in the background. I assume this means Apple does ensure this permission isn't completely misgranted during the review process, but it's mixed with the permission to play audio in the background.\nJust out of interest: In contrast since Android Pie (and Android Oreo to a lesser extent) Google will only return a silent stream whilst an app is in background mode.\n", "Q: macbook pro stuck in boot loop - recovery mode and safe mode not working I have a macbook pro 2015 (8gb ram, running macOS mojave) stuck in the loading screen with the apple logo and the loading bar 100% completed.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried leaving it for long periods of time.\n\n*Resetting the PRAM and SMC didn't help.\n\n*The machine wont go into safe mode using the shift button. \n\n*It also won't go into recovery mode using command+R. \n\n*Internet recovery also does not work either.

I then went to the two system directories which held .kext files (I forget them at present) and dumped the .kext file into a temporary folder (so the system couldn't find them). It then booted up fine.\nHappy to supply the full details if required, it could have been an issue with earlier OS, because OS 10.14 is quite different.\n", "Q: When I try to enter a user password to delete an account, it doesn't work. and I know the password I'm using is correct I got a new computer today.

So I've been working on my own app , I finally finished everything and my app is ready to publish , I completed each step to publish my app to the AppStore . So I visited AppStoreConnect to publish my app , But I cant submit the App because the \"Submit App Review\" button isnt clickable . \nAny idea why this is occurring ? \n\nA: The most likely cause for this is the holiday schedule. As per Apple:\n\nApp Store Connect Holiday Schedule: Dec 23–27 \nMake sure your apps are\n  up to date and ready for the holidays. New apps and app updates will\n  not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases\n  should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other App\n  Store Connect and developer account features will remain available.\n\nIf you feel this isn't the cause for your issue, then the next thing to check is that you haven't forgotten to provide some info in one of the required fields. Any fields with missing data will be highlighted for your convenience.\nOne thing that also catches people out is the Build. Make sure you've clicked on the + symbol to choose the build you want to submit.\n", "Q: Translate an app on the fly I want to use apps that are in Mandarin Chinese but I can’t speak that language. Are there any app translation apps? I’m picturing an app that translates text shown by another app on the fly. At present I’m limited to copying/pasting or taking a screenshot and passing that through a translation app. Are there any slicker solutions available now or foreseeable?\n\nA: Right now no automatic solution exists. Also, I don't see any new solutions coming up in the short term.\nThis is mainly due to the fact that Apple does not allow apps to take screenshots of other apps running on your device. Therefore it is hard to get the information into the translation app. With the newest iOS versions it is possible for an app to record the screen of the iOS device as a video - given that the user has to enable it each time, and has to permit it. Video does not provide a good input source for this use case, as screenshots are much easier to process for OCR and automatic translation.\nSo unless Apple provides their own solution for this, it does seem that a slick solution is still some time away. However, it is always hard to predict - especially about the future.\n", "Q: How do I extract and combine messages from Time Machine backups of ~/Library/Messages?

The result is 10-20\n  folders of messages with no obvious way to access them. I would like\n  to unify all of them and remove duplicates if they exist.\n\nYes, you are going to have many, many duplicates.  This is expected behavior given the way backups work.\nTime Machine does an incremental backup; meaning it only backs up what has changed since the last incremental backup.  Your chats are held in a single database file (referenced in your question), so every time you chat with someone, that database gets updated and ultimately gets backed up every time Time Machine runs.\n\nAre there any applications that do this or any sort of tutorial I\n  could follow?\n\nNo.  Just go to the most recent backup; all of the chat files will be there. \n\nThe files are sqlite so even a specification of the database structure\n  would be helpful.\n\nThey are sqlite3.  If you want to get the database structure, you can use the following commands in Terminal:\n$ sqlite3 chat.db\n\nsqlite> .schema                            # prints out the database schema\nsqlite> .tables                            # lists the database tables\nsqlite> PRAGMA table_info(tablename);      # lists the columns of a particular table   \nsqlite> select text from message;         # raw output of all text messages\n\n", "Q: Remove iOS apps from purchase history I'm trying to remove apps I'll never use again from my purchase history.

You are able to see the app analytics in iTunes Connect apps as it was originally/previously used to manage app distribution.\nThis may remain so, till Apple completes transition to App Store Connect (or upto Apple's discretion).\nApple removes certain apps from search listing, (while still keeping them available on the App Store) while making transitions.

I keep data on a thumb drive and sometimes my laptop gets hot running quicklookd presumably trying to make thumbnails of all of the files on the thumb drive. The high runner file types are images, pdfs and JSONs. I am guessing if I kept them zipped I could avoid the thumbnail generation but that's a different question.\nI've found index.sqlite and thumbnails.data in the private folder com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache. This answer may address my question indirectly but I don't really know what to do or what will happen.\nIf I just go and delete index.sqlite and thumbnails.data and then restart, will my computer blow up?

But I fail to find what Interval is by googling. Even man launchd.plist does not have this key. Thanks. \n\nA: The difference between StartInterval and ThrottleInterval is that StartInterval means that the program should be started after x seconds (more or less precisely), whereas ThrottleInterval means that the program should NOT be started again less than x seconds after it was last started.\nSo StartInterval is used to schedule something to run every X seconds, where ThrottleInterval is used when you schedule something to run based on other criteria, but don't want it to run too often.\n\"Interval\" does not seem to be a valid key - it is not in the man page, as you describe, but nor is it in the source code released by Apple. Either it is a mistype for \"StartInterval\", or it seems Apple has included \"Interval\" as an alias for \"StartInterval\" in their own builds.\n", "Q: Where are our iCloud images stored? My wife and I recently changed to Apple. Our setup includes a Macbook Pro, Apple TV and two iPhones. I have purchased 2 TB of iCloud storage which I am sharing with my wife. \nWe have ~3000 high-rez images that we want to migrate into iCloud Photos. They are stored on a Dropbox account today, so I installed iCloud for Windows on our old PC and started adding the images to shared albums in iCloud photos. \nAfter quite some time, it seems like they are all uploaded and we can view them on all devices. \nNow, here's the thing I can't wrap my head around. Even though it's about 12 GB of images that we've uploaded so far, iCloud still says we only consume 1 GB of disk space, and on my iPhone, the internal disk space says \"~180 MB images\" and \"~5 GB other\". The \"other\" part came when I started syncing images. \nOn my phone I have both iCloud-images and Optimize iPhone storage enabled. I though this would mean that the images where saved in their original resolution in iCloud, and at a lower kind of \"preview\" resolution on our phones, but since iCloud usage is not incrementing I guess I have understood it wrong. \nThe All images folder on my device is empty, but the shared albums folders are full of images. Shouldn't the disk usage on iCloud reflect that?\nWe're a bit worried that we have done something wrong and that our images might be deleted by mistake. Hence, here's a few questions that you'll hopefully be able to answer for us:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are our images uploaded to iCloud and not stored locally on my phone?\n\n*If they are uploaded into iCloud, how come we don't see an increase in disk usage? Why should one pay for additional iCloud storage when it doesn't increase?\n\n*What happens if I reinstall my phone? Will our images still be left \"intact\" in iCloud and ready to be synced once the phone is back up and running?\n\n*Is iCloud photos sufficient as a backup solution for the images? Or is it recommended to use an additional backup (I mean, more backups is always better, but is it overkill?)\n\nA: The reason this seems confusing is that you've added the photos to \"Shared albums\".\nUsually you would add your own photos to the Photos Library, which is essentially meant to be a collection of all your photos. Compared to that, \"Shared Albums\" is meant for taking out smaller collections of photos that you want to shared with third parties. \nPhotos added to your own Photos Library do count against your iCloud storage limit, however photos added to shared albums do not. This is why you're not seeing any increase in your usage of iCloud. Shared albums comes with a built-in limitation of 5000 photos per album.\nYou can read more about iCloud Shared Albums storage restrictions here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202786\nWhen you add a photo to a shared album, or to the Photos Library, the photos are uploaded to iCloud, yes. Whether or not they're also stored locally on your phone depends on your settings and how much storage space you have. You can choose to \"Optimize storage\", which means that only some is keps in full resolution on your phone, as space permits, otherwise only low res versions are kept on the device. The full res versions will be fetched from iCloud on request.\nIf you reinstall your phone, nothing happens to the iCloud stored photos. They will all be intact and ready to be synced after the phone is back up and running. However, note that you will need to be able to login with your Apple-ID (i.e. remember email-address, password and 2FA device if applicable).\nWhether or not this is sufficient as a backup solution is up to you. If it were me, I wouldn't say it is sufficient - I would always keep photos stored in a minimum of two systems. With iCloud Photos you can setup your devices so that the full res images are stored both in iCloud and on a local device. This leaves you with 2 copies... however a single error (user error or bug) could erase your photos from both places at the same time. That's why I always recommend a second backup.\n\nA: Answer to your last question would be to backup your photos on an external drive or another cloud storage system (for example : Google photos, Google Drive, Dropbox), and not only on your iCloud to prevent data loss if something would go wrong with your iCloud account.\nPhotos are way too precious to loose. \nI personally have at least 4 backups of my photos to be sure (that's what I hope) that I don't loose them! \nBtw, this not only applies for photos but for all of your files.\nHaving at least 2 backups (on different locations) of all your data decreases considerably possible data loss.\n", "Q: Running a script with administrator privileges from a standard client terminal I have the strong feeling I'm trying to reinvent the wheel, but I did spend some time without finding an existing solution.\nI have an already working shell script with several sudos.\nIts first target was admin users, so everything was ok.\nBut now I'm hitting a roadblock for standard users.\nSudo won't work, and as I must run this script on any machine any time, editing sudoers is not an option. \nHow can I rewrite this script so that it asks for admin user and password once, and then uses this credentials to run as many su as needed? What I'm particularly trying to do is feed password to one-line su but, security risk aside, I've never been able to use something as 'echo  | su ...', as seen on forums.\nThanks\n\nA: Generally speaking, you write the script as if an admin will be executing it and you check to see if the user has root privileges to run it. In all of my bash scripts where the script needs root privileges, I have the following code snipit that validates if the user has the correct privileges:\n# Validates that user is root; exits if not\necho \"Checking Root Privileges\"\nif [ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]\n  then exit 1;\n  else echo \"User is root\";\nfi\n\nBasically, all it's doing is checking the UID is 0 for the currently logged in user.  You can try it on the command line:\n$ id -u                # My login\n503\n\n$ sudo id -u           # Root privileges\n0\n\nRunning the script....\nThere are a couple of ways you can run the script from a login account that doesn't have admin privileges:\n\n\n*\n\n*add them to the sudoers file or add them to the wheel group\n\n*add them to a group (besides wheel) that has sudo privileges\n\n*run the script remotely via ssh with admin credentials\n\n*run the script as a launchd plist as a Launch Daemon (runs as root)\n\n", "Q: How to buy a gift card from a German store for a Russian store?

I am looking to upgrade RAM on a MacBook mid-2010, Model A1342. According to apple, I can only upgrade up to 4GB of RAM (currently only has 2GB). I don't want to blow up the computer if I add 8GB of RAM.\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: There are three limitations on the amount of RAM that you can put into most Macs:\n1. The number of slots in the machine. \n2. The size of memory available on one RAM module.\n3. Limits to the memory addressing of the memory controller or OS. \nYour Mac has 2 slots, so it can only add 2 of whatever size memory cards are available. Very often, when Apple releases a Mac model, only certain sizes are available, with larger memory modules being manufactured at a later time. Apple usually doesn't make a statement on compatibility of newer modules at a later date.\nSome Macs are limited to only address a certain amount of memory, either by hardware limitations, or by the OS. Adding more may not give any benefit (with only the machine's maximum being addressed), and in some cases adding more can cause poor performance. (For instance, the 2009 MacBook could address up to 6Gb of RAM.)\nYour Mac can cope with up to 16 GB of RAM, if running Lion or higher.\nEveryMac spec\n\nA: A 32bit system cannot manage more than 4 GB of RAM because of its addressing limitations. (2 exp. 32 =  4. 294.967.296 different addresses that can be used. That's 4 GB) Adding more than 4 GB of RAM is thus not a good idea as your system may possibly not work anymore.

The external superdrive spits out discs.\n\nA: I figured out a workaround that is probably more unconventional and useless to most people.\nThe things I used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean Lion installer\n\n*A random Windows 7 Pro x86 ISO found online and burned to DVD\n\n*Doner install machine (MacBook 7,1)\n\n*Target machine (MacPro1,1)\n\n*Empty 128GB SSD disk (any disk smaller than target will work)\n\n*HDD cloning machine\n\n\nThe steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swap the disk with all my personal files out of the MacBook and install an empty disk (must be smaller than the target disk).\n\n*Made a clean installation of Lion on the disk.\n\n*Ran through bootcamp on the MacBook (the DVD I burned earlier worked perfectly which is further evidence of something really weird interfering with detection of the Windows install DVD on the Mac Pro). I reached the Windows 7 desktop. It's important to not install any drivers as this could make the installation useless when moving to the target machine. Windows will automatically install drivers for a few things which will later need to be disabled.\n\n*Removed the SSD disk and cloned it to the target 1TB 3.5\" HDD with a cloning machine. Installed the 1TB HDD in the Mac Pro.\n\n*Booted Windows 7 Pro x86 (only worked in safe mode)\n\n*Disabled drivers for non-critical hardware and unplugged all peripheral devices except mouse and keyboard). This fixed the boot issues with normal Windows and now I could boot normally without needing to use safe mode.\n\n*I haven't done this yet but I need to resize the Windows and macOS partitions to use the entire disk (right now I have 2x64GB partitions). This is doable but a little harder since Disk Utility will not resize/interact with partitions with a Windows partition on the disk. This is probably because of the different file system. Then, I just run the bootcamp 4 support drivers and everything should be normal.\n\n\nHope this helps someone though I doubt it because most people don't have access to the equipment that I used. There are other methods involving what appears to be cloning virtual machine images to HDDs but I haven't attempted. This solution seemed easier to me.\nThe problem still puzzles me. The Mac Pro DVD drive works fine as it is able to play movies and install software. However, it just gives a finder popup for a \"blank DVD\" with the Windows install DVD inserted. On the other hand, my MacBook 7,1 recognizes the DVD perfectly. I didn't have a spare IDE DVD drive to try in the Mac Pro but I think the drive is fine. Generally, I've found the Mac Pro to be subject to more issues than other Apple products because of its ability to be customized. I suspect this is just another example. This Mac Pro should have been easily able to perform this bootcamp installation as it is officially supported to run bootcamp with Windows 7 x86.\n", "Q: Time Capsule - what happens when full, if there is more than one system backup? I have a Time Capsule that was used for backing up several offline macs, when the local drive sizes were relatively small. (Lets say theres two old backups called \"iMac\" and \"iBook\".\nCurrently it backs up two relatively new devices (lets call them MacBook and Mini). \nIt has become full in the last year. I know that Time Machine discards older backups to keep the most current, but how does it decide what data to keep between the different systems?\n\nA: Space will be reclaimed by Time Machine only using the older content from backups of the same computer. Consult this archived page from Pondini:\n\nTime Machine will, eventually, fill all the empty space available to it before it begins deleting old backups.  When multiple Macs are \"competing\" for the same backup space, there might be room for several months of backups for one, but only a few weeks for another.  This is especially likely to happen if you start backing-up a new Mac to a drive that already has a lot of backups from another Mac.  Time Machine on the new Mac will not delete backups from the other Mac(s), so when it needs space for new backups, it will delete the oldest backups from the new Mac instead.\n\nWith a Time Capsule or any network drive used as a disk for Time Machine, every computer backup is stored in its own sparse bundle disk image. This is how multiple computers can be backed up to one location. Within each sparse bundle disk image, linking is used to minimize the storage required for files or folders which have not changed between backups.\nThis archived page from Pondini explains how to manually delete from backups and also explains the structure.\n", "Q: Is there a way to apply custom shaders to macOS screen?

I wish to set Google as Homepage for Safari on my iPhone. I’ve tried to do it through Settings app, Safari settings and notifications but to no avail.\nHow do I accomplish this?\n\nA: Unlike the desktop version of Safari, there is no concept of setting a Homepage in Safari for iOS. You can't set a Homepage to open automatically when you open a new tab in Safari for iOS.\nBut there's another approach that you can take to achieve the similar end-goal. The idea of using a Homepage in a browser, is to have a way to open the website that you visit very frequently and do so quickly.\nUsing Safari for iOS, you can add a shortcut to a website on your iPhone's Home Screen. It will appear just like a regular app icon, but tapping on it will open the corresponding webpage in a Safari tab, thereby serving similar purpose as a Homepage.\nTo add a websites to your iPhone Home Screen, simply start by opening the website (Google in your case) on your iPhone:\n\nNow, tap on the share icon (rectangle with an upward facing arrow) shown in the toolbar at the bottom to reveal the share sheet:\n\nNow, in the bottom row, tap on the Add to Home Screen item. The icon image is set to the website favicon and the name to the webpage title. You can change the name that will be displayed for the website. To confirm, tap on the Add button:\n\nUpon tapping the Add button, Safari automatically goes to background and the recently added icon is shown on the iPhone Home Screen:\n\nThe icon behaves just like other app icons. You can move it to a different page on the Home Screen, move it into a folder etc. You can add as many website shortcuts on your iPhone Home Screen as you want. Technically, the icon is simply a bookmark for the website and thus occupy minuscule space on your iPhone.\nYou can easily remove them just like you remove any other app from your iPhone. Simply tap and hold on any icon until they all start to wiggle and cross button appears on the top left. Tap on the cross button to remove the website bookmark from your iPhone Home Screen:\n\n\nNow, you can also do away with opening Google in Safari altogether. You can use Safari address bar itself to directly search for your query on Google or other select search engines. Simply open a new tab in Safari and start typing your query, and the search engine suggestions will be shown below:\n\nYou can tap on a suggestion to search for it directly, or tap on the Go button to search for the query that you have typed, using the configured search engine. By default, the search engine is set to Google. You can configure to use another search engine instead of Safari by going to Settings app → Safari → Search Engine and selecting the search engine of your choice from the available options:\n\nThus, technically speaking, by default, Google is already configured as your Homepage in Safari for iOS and you don't need to take any additional step (or do whatever is mentioned in the long post above ).\n", "Q: White Screen edges on Macbook Pro 2014 I have a MacBook Pro 15 inch, 2014 model, with 2 GPUs: Intel and NVIDIA 750M.\nLast Monday I turned it on and I noticed that the screen is white as you can see in the picture.\nThe problem is that when I keep the Mac turned on for some time (>2 hours) the screen goes back to normal without white edges.\nWhen I turn it off and keep it turned off for a while, then turn it on again it becomes white again and I must wait >2 hours so I can see my screen without this whiting effect.\n\n\nA: This looks like a well known hardware problem. \nI had the same Problem after falling asleep on my Macbook, the pressure destroyed the Display.\nYou should contact Apple and get the Display replaced.\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra - Can't merge former time machine partition on external hard drive I have an external hard drive with two partitions. One partition was used to save files and the other was dedicated to Time Machine. Now I have a new hard drive which I use exclusively for Time Machine, so in the first hard drive I simply want to delete the Time Machine partition and merge its empty space in the other partition.\nThe problem is that using Disk Utility I was able to delete the content in the Time Machine partition, but I can't merge it. The minus sign which I would normally use to remove a partition is greyed out and there's a message saying \"You can not remove the first volume on the disk\".\nI read that using diskutil from the command line might work, but I'm not sure how to do it. \nThis is the diskutil output:\n~ ❯❯❯ diskutil list disk2\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Time machine backup     750.0 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Files                   1.2 TB     disk2s3\n\n\nA: Try First Aid button on  Disk Utility. \nSee what will came up.

But I wonder how do I sort the output by file size? With GNU sort, there is  the --human-numeric-sort option for this, but the sort which is part of macOS doesn't support this. So how can I sort the result by file size?\n\nA: I don't know exactly how sort -h is supposed to work since it mixes the B, K, M and G prefixes, but it was at least workable for me in Mojave:\ncat tmutil-compare | grep \"M  \" | cut -c 3- | sort -h\n\n\nA: To slightly improve upon Andreas' answer, you can sort without having to cut out the beginning part that indicates if it's an addition, removal, or change:\ntmutil compare backup-1 backup-2 | grep \"^[\\!+-]\" | sort -h -k 2\n(The grep part filters out the summary lines)\nThe names \"backup-1/2\" are the full paths to two timestamped backup directories, eg /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Computer-Name/2020-09-10-123220. You can also pass in sub-folders if you just want to compare those, though I think they need to both point to the same path within their respective backups.\nOr if you want to filter by just additions (+) and modifications (!) without removals (-), for example:\ntmutil compare backup-1 backup-2 | grep \"^[\\!+]\" | sort -h -k 2\nNote that the \"!\" needs to be escapes as it's got special meaning in bash.\n\nA: Please use the following command that works perfectly for me on mac.

(My account is gmail, but it's basically the same underlying problem.)\nWhile probably not a phishing attack, it certainly could be malicious.\n\nApple wrote:\n\nThanks for contacting us. I'm sorry that you weren't able to reset\n  your Apple ID password. I’ll do everything that I can to get your\n  issue resolved. If you haven’t already, you can try resetting your\n  password online at: http://iforgot.apple.com For more information on\n  resetting your security questions, see this page:\n  https://support.apple.com/HT201485 For security reasons, I can't help\n  you access this account via email.\n\nSo far as I know my account has been hijacked.

Do they have an e-mail address?  Their e-mail to me came from appstore_emea@apple.com but they've already explained that they won't reset the password via e-mail.\nWhen I try to contact Apple support through their website it goes in a loop where they want my Apple ID and then challenge me with secret questions.\nAt best it's annoying.  At worst it's some sort of attack.  This has been going on at least since 2016, we're almost in 2019.\nThis is the e-mail, or a portion of:\nWelcome to iCloud.\nYour Apple ID is <me>@gmail.com.\niCloud keeps all your photos and videos, documents, contacts, and more up to date automatically, so you always have access to the latest versions on all your devices. \n\n\nA: \nHow to contact Apple if somebody has created an AppleID using an email address of mine.\n\nThis particular answer is meant to address the qualifier (emphasized)  portion of the question.\nUnless your email address is not 100% solely in your control, this cannot happen.\nWhy? Because immediately upon creating an AppleID, you are immediately asked to confirm the account and an email is with with a code only; there are no links to click or addresses to reply to.\n\n\nTo be perfectly clear, an AppleID cannot be created unless someone physically types out the confirmation code in the boxes on Apple's AppleID website.\nWhat this means\nIf \"someone\", whether nefarious or innocent intentions, created an AppleID account with your email address they either had:\n\n\n*\n\n*access your email account\n\n*access to a trusted device that's no longer in your possession (sold, gifted, or stolen) \n\n*you confirmed the account and forgot about it.\n\n\nWhat is Apple going to do?\nNothing, unless you can authenticate with the credentials the account creator provided. \n\n\n*\n\n*email address\n\n*Birthday\n\n*Phone Number (required in some countries)\n\n*3 different security questions with 6 options each as to the question being asked (18 different permutations)\n\n\nApple needs to validate who you are before it will even contemplate making a change.  The reason for the extra verification credentials is for the simple reason email addresses and phone numbers change; your birthday and the city where your parents met (one of the questions) will not.\n\nSo far as I know my account has been hijacked. I say my account, because it's my e-mail address which is used to login. So far as I know this is some variant of a malicious social engineering attack.\n\nIt could be your account and equally as likely it's not.   We (here on Ask Different) and Apple only have your word that the email is in fact \"yours.\"  How do we know that you haven't compromised the legitimate AppleID account owner and you're attempting to hack their credentials? How secure would AppleID be if they allowed anyone to merely claim an email address was theirs and to reset the password?\n(It's not an accusation, it's an academic exercise)\nI can already hear your argument:  It's my email account.  Ok, let's look at it from Apple's prospective:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given the security process, your email must have been compromised when it was created\n\n*Given that you can't authenticate any other security credential, but claiming you've got access to email means email is potentially compromised now.\n\n\nFrom Apple's perspective, it's not their problem.\n\nA: Same issue here, Allan's answer is unhelpful and presumptuous that it is \"impossible\" for an email address to be tied up to an Apple ID without being verified.\nAlthough it has not been verified, the email address is still unavailable for anyone else (like the actual owner of the address) to use.\n\nA: I have this situation with a domain we purchased from another person who happened to set up an AppleID account with it before we purchased the domain-—so we now have the same email address but we can't reset the appleID with it alone--but we do get all AppleID related email intended for the previous owner.\nI'm not sure how to deal with that problem——but it is an example of this happening without losing control of an email address. Instead, we purchased a domain that expired and had email addresses on it we are re-using, so to speak, that have AppleIDs tied to them.\n", "Q: Notification badges doesn't work well with multiple iOS devices When I check, say, my new Instagram direct messages on my iPhone, the red notification badge doesn’t automatically disappear from the Instagram app on my iPad, until I open it. The same thing happens for other apps as well.\nIs there a way where the badge count is synchronized across all the devices?\n\nA: How the notification badge count for an iOS app is updated across the app life cycle events depends on how well the app developer has implemented it.\nIn an ideal scenario, if the app developer has carefully planned for and implemented it correctly, the badge icon should sync and update when the network activity happens on the other devices and the appropriate handler method for background app refresh gets a chance to run its code.\nIn some cases, it may so happen, that the implementation isn't done completely/correctly by the app developer. In such cases, you may continue to see an out-of-sync badge count on the other devices, as the app hasn't got a chance to execute necessary code yet.\nWhen the app actually get the chance to run in the foreground, it generally communicates with the back-end servers and re-sets the badge count, the count comes to sync (as you are observing).\nIn the cases where the implementation is done all-right by the app developer (the competent ones usually ensure this), the rare chances when the count doesn't sync may be observed, either when the device hasn't yet got a chance to get an active connection to the Internet, or is either running in Low Power Mode (only applicable to iPhone), where the Background App Refresh is disabled by the iOS to preserve battery life.\nAdditionally, to optimize battery life, the iOS subsystem shuts down the device Wi-Fi connection after a set interval post device has gone into sleep mode.\nThus, with an active Internet connection, on the devices with Low Power Mode disabled, you should see the badge count sync within seconds on most of the apps.\n", "Q: How to batch add folders to Folder Actions I actively manage a directory of folders that contain images that are organised by modification dates.

I would like the luxury of going through them one by one and deleting the ones I don’t use. But it's taking a while to get around to it. In the meantime, when I download any new apps they just never appear on my screens. I can locate them using Spotlight search, but the icons don't appear on the Home Screen.\nSince I want to organize them onto my first Home Screen, I need to be able to find them to move them. I have tried restarting, hard resets — I even tried the recent suggestion on how to add another Home Screen by dragging an icon to the right to create a new page, but it won’t work. I am on an 12.9” iPad Pro running iOS 12.1.2.\n\nA: There's an upper cap on the maximum number of Home Screens that can be created on an iOS device. The count is a bit higher for iPad than for iPhone.\nOnce you hit the limit, any newly installed app doesn't show up on Home Screen, as no more screens can be created. You can still continue to install new apps as long as free storage space is available on your iPad.\nYou can search for an apps using Spotlight even if its icon is not visible. One way to view more apps is to organize apps within folders. A folder can house many apps (the limit varies between iPhone and iPad). Since a folder only takes up the visible are required for one app, you can see more apps when using folders than without one. (The maximum number of Home Screens or maximum numbers of apps in a single folder for a device are not officially documented and can be determined by experimenting.)\nTo create a folder, simply tap and hold on an app icon until all the icons start to wiggle. Now drag and drop an app icon onto another to house them into a folder. You can also assign a custom name to the folder to easily recognize it. However, you can not create a folder inside a folder.\nOnce you have organized apps into folders and are able to see the icons, you can drag to organize them on Home Screens as desired.\nWith iPad drag and drop support introduced with iOS 11, you can also quickly move multiple apps around.\nAlternatively, if you have access to a Mac or a PC, you can also re-organize apps icons easily using iTunes.\n\nA: To delete / hide apps on iPhone go to App Store while logged in.  Tap on Today icon on bottom of screen.  Then tap on your user logo in the right hand corner.  Then a screen appears - tap Purchased.  Select the category you want, All or Purchased.  then find the app and swipe left.  Detele should appear.  Select to delete.\n", "Q: iPhone 6: Unable to find service and only displays \"Searching\" I have an iPhone 6 with the most recent iOS software installed.

Is that an absolute?\nThat, in order to create an Apple ID, that the e-mail must be authenticated?\nApple writes:\n\nMy name is Jennifer, and I am one of the Senior Advisors here with the\n  iTunes Store Support Team. After consulting with the adviser handling\n  your request, I have taken ownership of your case so that I can work\n  directly with you, and answer any questions you may have. \nI understand you’ve received an email about someone using your email\n  to create an Apple ID using a device you do not having. I would want\n  this reviewed as well if someone was using my email, allow me to help.\nAs we have no means to contact out to the person who create the\n  account, as this is only an ID in the system, not a full account to be\n  associated to any downloads or purchases. I would use the site\n  iforgot.apple.com to begin the process to gain access to this account\n  and reset the password and associate it to your own device.\n\nI ask because Wikipedia states:\n\nAn Apple ID must be a valid email address, protected by a password\n  that is an alphanumeric string of at least 8 characters, and\n  case-sensitive.\n\nand\n\nWhen a user creates a new Apple ID, Apple will send a verification\n  email to the email address that the user provided during registration.\n  The user is required to follow the URL that is included in the\n  verification email to activate the account, then the user will be able\n  to use their Apple ID. It is possible to create an Apple ID without\n  specifying a credit card.\n\nMy question:  what happens if, in the best case scenario for me, some one got a nice iPhone for Christmas, and simply entered my e-mail by accident?\nIs the account ever activated?  Is it in a sort of limbo?\nAgain, Alex's answer categorically states:\n\nGiven the security process, your email must have been compromised when\n  it was created\n\nWhich is concerning, to say the least.  So, to clarify, might it be possible that this is a mix-up?  Or, because I received the activation code the other day, that my e-mail has been compromised?\n(Unfortunately, no iPhone for Christmas.)\nA bit less concerned now that I seem to be speaking with a person at Apple.  Still, curious.\nIt occurs to me that I just received the e-mail about the iCloud account being created; not sure that's the same as an Apple ID creation.  It's not impossible that I created an account long ago, but unlikely.  I'll look for other e-mails from Apple.\n\nA: In the answer to your previous question on this topic, it's answers the question directly in the verification email sent out by Apple; it's the very last sentence.\n\nIf you did not make this request, you can ignore this email.  No Apple\n  ID will be created without verification.\n\nI've included the same picture here, but larger for your reference.\n\n\nA: I realize this is an old post but I thought I’d give some feedback. You can call 1-800 my-apple Apple support and ask to speak with the senior advisor they can dispute email ownership and take care of it. it’s true Apple makes you verify the email address. but I have heard of cases where someone’s actually allowed to sign into iCloud on an Apple device before the email is verified. Usually it’s happens when people don’t realize it has to be an actual email address so they enter exp. first name last name@gmail.com thinking it’s just their Apple ID username then of course they can’t verify the email.

In iStat Menus temperatures from sensors, RPMs, current meters and voltage meters from CPU aren't refreshing. Also fan sometimes switches on high RPM and runs continuously, even when laptop is quite cold. When I plug in charger, fan goes back to 1200 RPM and temperatures are being normally refreshed. I had this issue propably even before updating to Mojave. I tried resetting SMC, but nothing happens. What is the possible reason for this issue?\n\nA: You've already reset the System Management Controller, which was the first thing to try, so I would probably start with testing to see if this behaviour is replicated when booted into Safe Mode and if the issue persists then running Apple Diagnostics.\nBoot into Safe Mode \nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBA \n\n*Restart your MBA\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does your MBA still seem to behave strangely when running on battery, etc) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBA as normal \n\n*Test again when booted normally \n\n\nIf the problem doesn't occur while booted into Safe Mode, let me know and we'll go from there. \nIf the problem persists, proceed with running Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBA\n\n*Restart your MBA\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead.

My computer had a sudden shutdown today, and part of the associated report is found below:\n\n** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 4 caller 0xffffff800a4bade0): \"a freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.256: expected\n  0xdeadbeefdeadbeef but found 0xdeadbeeedeadbeef, bits changed\n  0x100000000, at offset 120 of 256 in element 0xffffff805d4c7d00,\n  cookies 0x3f00113ca62d16fc\n\nOriginally I thought maybe this was a virus of some kind, since the number deadbeefdeadbeef looked like it wasn't a random memory address.  I Googled the term deadbeef and found that it's a standard magic number.\nMy question is, what could have caused such a memory corruption as this?\n\nA: The error message you have got is directly from the operating system kernel - warning of unexpected memory corruption. This is obviously not supposed to happen. 0xdeadbeef is indeed a common \"magic number\", but it appears here for a very specific reason. \nSpecifically this error messages comes from zalloc (a zone-based memory allocator) within the kernel. The kernel is the part of the operating system that is run in \"privileged mode\", meaning roughly that it has full access to the computer. Your own applications are run in a limited mode that gives it less access to the computer. As part of its functioning the kernel uses RAM memory to store and process information. In order to keep track of which parts of RAM is actually used the kernel uses many different allocators. The zone-based memory allocator is special in that it is used by the kernel itself only (i.e. not for applications) and that it allocates only RAM blocks of specific, fixed sizes. For example it might allocate blocks of 256, 512 and 1024 bytes - but it won't allocate a block of 300 bytes. This is done to make the allocator simpler and thus faster.\nThe cookie part of the error message refers to a security related feature, where pointers (memory addresses) in the kernel are \"poisoned\" by combining (with XOR) them with a cookie. The cookie is simply a random number picked when you boot your computer. This ensures that these memory addresses seem random, and are not predictable by virus/malware that exploit bugs to get access to privileged resources.\nOne specific functionality of the zone based allocator is that when the kernel frees the memory (i.e. states that it no longer has use for an allocated piece of memory), it doesn't just note that it is free for other use - but it also overwrites the memory pointer with the magic number 0xdeadbeef. This serves two purposes: (1) if the kernel erroneously use the memory after it has freed it, following the pointer wouldn't \"happen to work\" or \"happen to point to other data which will be corrupted\" - but rather trigger a system error interrupt as the address 0xdeadbeef is mapped to ensure that happens, (2) if the allocator later is asked for a new allocations and wants to hand out the same block again, it can detect if it was changed, meaning that there's a bug or hardware error somewhere.\nIn your case the error message indicates that (2) happened - so something altered some of the RAM in your computer that the kernel thought was marked as not in use. The cause of such a memory corruption is most often either a kernel bug, third party kernel extension bug or hardware error.\nIf the problem is a kernel bug, you probably have no way to fix this except to either wait for a new update from Apple, or downgrade to an earlier version of macOS. If this happens once in a blue moon, then just wait for the next update. If it happens frequently, you can try to figure out exactly what you did to trigger the bug, and avoid doing that in the future - or downgrade to an earlier version of macOS that hasn't got the bug.\nIf the problem is a third party kernel extension bug, I would check for updates to all of the kernel extensions you have installed. Kernel extensions are usually installed as drivers for third party hardware, or for special applications that change the way the system works at a low level. This could be for example virtualization software (such as VMware) or software such as Little Snitch or similar. It is always a good idea to disconnect any third party hardware and not start up such low-level applications and check if the bug disappears - then reconnect one thing at a time until you have the problem.\nIf the problem is hardware error, you really have no choice but to get the hardware replaced. Usually errors like this are caused by defective RAM modules. It could also be a thermal or logic board problem, but it is not usually the case. Use the Apple Hardware Test to check if your RAM modules have errors.\nIn the extreme case this error could be caused by a virus, but I would definitely look for other reasons first. A virus or malware usually tries to keep its existence hidden, so it wouldn't be triggering error messages such as these (and causing system lockups). However it is possibly that a bug in a virus triggers this error messages, similar to bugs in non-malicious kernel extensions.\n", "Q: How to iterate over Reminders using AppleScript I'm trying to write an AppleScript that simply iterates over uncompleted Reminders and displays the name.  The code below generates this error: Reminders got an error: Can’t make name of reminder (reminder id \\\"x-apple-reminder://838D4BDF-C520-440A-ADF2-B66FD602ADDC\\\") into type string\nI figured out how to make it work by iterating from 1 to (count of notCompleted); but I would like to understand why the code below doesn't work. (The fact that I expect the code below to work suggests that I am misunderstanding what kind of objects are in notCompleted.)  What exactly is contained in notCompleted, and what exactly is the type of currentReminder?\ntell application \"Reminders\"\n    set snoozeList to \"Snooze\"\n    set notCompleted to reminders in list snoozeList whose completed is false\n    repeat with currentReminder in notCompleted\n        display dialog (name of reminder currentReminder)\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: Your understanding seems on point, apart from two small items.  As you already know, notCompleted contains a list of reminders that are not completed.  The variable currentReminder in each iteration of the repeat loop will therefore contain a single reminder object.  Therefore, firstly, you don't need to (or rather, you ought not to) use the reminder specifier in name of reminder currentReminder.  Instead, just use name of currentReminder.\nThis doesn't entirely solve the issue as the name of currentReminder is returned in a partially de-referenced format (which is something I won't go in to here, but is a consequence of how the items are enumerated under the hood).  This means that to access the actual text data, you either have to coerce it to text like so:\ndisplay dialog (name of currentReminder as text)\n\nor use the get command, which basically does the same thing:\ndisplay dialog (get name of currentReminder)\n\nSo it's nothing that you're doing wrong in a strict sense, just quirks of AppleScript.\n", "Q: Internal DVD drive not working I have a Macbook Pro 15 inch, mid 2010 with High Sierra installed (10.13.6)\nRecently I tried to put a DVD into the internal DVD drive, but nothing showed up. It made some weird sounds as if it was trying to get the drive running, but it didn't help. So I tried to eject the DVD, but the eject button didn't work as well. I couldn't eject it from Finder either. I tried restart the computer while holding the eject button, but it didn't work. Then I just dropped to get it out.\nBut whenever I open my computer, it says the weird sounds as if it is trying to run the DVD. It runs 3 times, and then it stops.\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Unfortunately it sounds like your optical drive bit the dust. \nThe fact that it tries to read a presumably good DVD and can't and you get an error opening DVD Player AND can't get the disc out of the drive speaks to likely needing a new drive. \nYou will need to take it in for repair which will likely mean a replacement optical drive.\n\nA: Yep. All mechanical drives, (particularly CD/DVD drives and old-fashioned hard drives), have a limited lifespan and wear out. 8 years is pretty good actually. I'd recommend the opposite though — just get yourself a $20 external USB CD/DVD drive, and then (when you're ready for it, replace the internal DVD drive with a secondary SSD (I assume you've already replaced the HDD it came with... right?)

One of the reservations I've had with ARD is that it allows anyone on the same network as you to access your computer, as long as:\n\n\n*\n\n*ARD is enabled (this can be confirmed by scanning with the ARD client software) \n\n*Your username (most likely the same or similar to your computer name that shows up in the ARD client software)\n\n*Your password. (this is not so easy to figure out, but most users seem to be a bit more lax with their local machine password, than they would with say a cloud account password, which may be managed by a password manager)\nThe problem with this is that there doesn't seem to be any brute force protections, built into ARD, nor key / certificate method, where you could setup a key in advance.\nI think I've found a way around this to some extent, but wanted to know if this would actually work, or if there are any shortcomings in this. My work-around would be to create a new user on the machine I plan to be the ARD host. This user account would be called, for example, \"ARD\", and have a really strong password manager generated password. \nI would then use my the ARD client machine to login to the ARD user on the host. What I've noticed is that once you've connected, and as long as you have the usernames / passwords for the other user accounts on the host machine, you can login to those other user accounts, even if those other users don't have ARD enabled under the preference tab. \nAre there any potential issues you could see with the above ? \n\nA: The protection of the ARD is in the fact that you can enable and disable users for this feature.\nThe brute force protection is that of the user account. You can set it up to lock after 5 failed attempts or what ever you please.\nIt is strongly advisable NOT to use an Admin account for this, but instead use a normal account to give access to the ARD, and using account switching or admin privilege escalation where and when you need it. Part of the reason being is that you can take over the session of any user currently logged in that way, without the user knowing. So IF you are worried about people breaking in to your account, that is the way to minimise the risk as far as possible.\n(Best practice is that nobody is admin on a Mac apart from a dedicated account that can be used for privilege escalation instead) \nHope this helps in your decision making process.\nGJ\n", "Q: Does macOS Mojave support NightShift on external monitors? After upgrading to Mojave, I could have sworn I saw Night Shift kick-in on my external 4K BenQ monitor. But no more. \nDid I dream that? Or is Mojave supposed to be capable of supporting Night Shift on external displays? If so, might it stop working because of sleeping/waking and/or attaching/detaching the monitor?\n\nA: Night Shift is working on external monitors in Mojave.\nSometimes Night Shift deactivates itself on the external display when you wake the system from sleep.

I'd like to change this chart\n\nto the following one:\n\nSo, I'd like to reverse the order of rows. According to an answer on a similar question, you need to create a formula and put it in each cell manually to have this result. But is that really the only way to do this (rather simple) change? I have 3 charts I'd like to reverse and each of them has 3-5 columns and more than 400 rows. So, to put a formula in every single cell certainly is quite time-consuming (to say the least).\nBtw., the numbers in every cell are supposed to be placeholders for words. So, selecting 2 cells in a column and dragging the window down won't work.\n\nA: It seems I've finally figured it out. You need to number all your rows and then select the column which contains these numbers in the organize/sort sidebar. Finally, you choose increasing or decreasing to reverse the rows. This order remains even if you delete the column with the numbers.\n", "Q: Unresponsive iMessages and FaceTime on Mojave I have this issue with Messages, FaceTime when it gets unresponsive on start.

Yet it's what I usually do when I run into problems. It's sort of DIY mentality.\nIf you don't see the Library folder, it's because it's hidden by default.\nYou can change that in \"Show View Options\" menu in \"View\" option of Finder. Or by pressing command and j at the same time. (You should be at ~/ for this option to be shown).\n", "Q: MAC OS Mojave: Why do the icon texts display unnormally (squeeze and crowd)? After I upgrade my MacBook Pro from 10.8 to 10.14, I found the icon texts display unnormally. They are too crowd. Anybody have any solution towards this problem?\n\n\nA: There are likely a few things going on here. Firstly is that Apple's new default font is San Fransisco in Mojave (OS X 10.14.x) and I believe in 10.8 was Lucida Grande. So some of the text crowding you see could be caused by a different font with it's different kerning, etc.\nIt is also possible, and judging from the screencaps you posted that some of your desktop/folder defaults were changed or reset when you did the upgrade.\nIf you go to your desktop and select \"Show view options\" from the \"View\" menu a window will pop up allowing you to change a lot of the items that will effect what you see on your desktop. You can do the same in a Finder window but I'm sticking with the Desktop here for sake of simplicity.\n\nThe things you may want to fiddle with are the grid spacing and the text size.\nThe grid spacing will move icons closer together and farther apart. So if you have long-ish file names Finder will squish the text when the icons are closer together.\nThe text size will also affect how Finder shows file/folder names. Bigger fonts will cause the Finder to try and fit longer file names in smaller spaces (grid spacing) and squish the words/letters together. The trade-off here is that smaller font sizes can be harder to read.\nIn your particular case I would increase the grid spacing and decrease the font size substantially and then see if things are looking better.\n\nA: Finally, I give up and install the new system MAC OS 14.3 from scratch.\n", "Q: Does System Integrity Protection have any effects on OS's besides Mac OS?

So, does it? \n\nA: No, SIP is only applied within a macOS partition. You can have a look at /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf to see which folders and files get protected by default.\n\nA: SIP is a macOS feature/function that's applicable to El Capitan and later; it's not dependent on the Mac hardware.\nIf you're not running macOS, there's no SIP.\n", "Q: Issues with screen not coming on when Mac is running I run a Late 2012 Mac Mini running 10.13 High Sierra with a Dell QHD monitor via DisplayPort.

Of course, I'm aware I'd need to buy the cellular Verizon compatible iPad, and am not expecting to be able to make calls from an iPad. Only internet access. \nI was just at an Apple store getting a battery update on my old 6, and asked this question. They told me 'no', but didn't really explain why. \nFor what it's worth, I just finished a chat with Verizon, they said it wold not work - \n\nThis is why I am here, hoping a member has already tried this. Whether it failed or not, I'd trust an answer here more than anything I get from Verizon. \n\nA: It depends on the carrier. Generally, iPad SIMs from a carrier are so-called ‘data SIMs’ as they only provide the data service. A normal SIM can act as data SIM if the carrier supports it with an appropriate carrier bundle. You can speak to your carrier or see if anyone else has asked your carrier on a forum, e.g. UK's EE. That chat with Verizon appears like you're talking to a misinformed person — the SIM will easily fit, and the size difference of the iPad itself is obviously not a concern.\n", "Q: How can I remove this alert badge from my settings icon? \n*\n\n*I'm on the iOS 12.1.2 version.\n\n*I have no other alerts in my settings.\nBut this just won't go away:\n\nI think it's related to prodding for iCloud upgrades, but I'm just not seeing anything at all. How can I get rid of this badge?\n\nA: It's a bug in recent version(s?) of iOS. The fix is to log out of iCloud and log back in. I have the badge as well, but haven't tried the fix yet.\nFrom reddit:\n\nSo on a hunch, I signed out of iCloud and back in. Badge gone!\nWhen I signed back in, there was a prompt about not having backed up in over 7 days. So maybe there is a bug that's causing that to lurk under the hood somewhere.\n\n\nA: There are several things it could be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the top of your settings and under your Apple ID check for any notifications \n\n*Go to general -> software update and see if there is a software update that is needed to be downloaded \n\n*Go to iCloud in settings and check for any notifications\n", "Q: View email source in iOS Gmail app Is there a way to view the email source HTML in the iOS Gmail.app?

Is there any way to stop this? It's very annoying.\n\nA: Just in case this is a help to any future readers, I found the reason for my iPhone XS constantly pocket dialling being emergency contacts. When FaceID fails in my pocket, it manages to tap emergency and then either dial a random number or go into my Medical ID and call one of my emergency contacts.\nTurning off emergency contacts has almost completely solved the problem, the only other problem being raise-to-wake which commonly activates in my pocket. I used a OnePlus before this (which sucked), but it did have this awesome feature called Pocket Mode which prevented the screen activating in my pocket - which I do miss.\n", "Q: Boot Camp / macOS Mojave / 3 TB Fusion drive If I replace the current 3 TB hard drive with a compatible SSD drive, will this fix the issue with being able to load and run boot camp on my 2012 iMac? \n\n\n*\n\n*If you see the alert 'Installation cannot proceed with Boot Camp configured'\n\nA: Bootcamp isn't dependent on the type of drive that you use.\nWhat matters is it's hardware compatability with the Windows version you want to run.\n", "Q: Unable to merge partitions or reinstall OSX I have 1 SSD disc in MacBook Pro mid 2009 with 2 partitions and I would like to make a clean installation.\nSo.. using Disc Utility I have erased both partitions (OS X Extended - Journaled). So far so good. Now I wanted to merge both partitions and when I do that I get \"Operation failed.. Couldn't unmount disk\". When I click done I see both partitions are unmounted.\nWhen I try to merge partitions again I get instant error \"The volume Macintosh HDD 1 is not journaled. To enable journaling click Enable journaling in the File menu\". I did that but no luck. Still the same error.\nSo I gave up merging partitions and tried to install OS X. But no luck.. there is no partition to select during the installation process. Only the recovery partition is visible.\nI tried to unmount discs from terminal using diskutil but none of partitions can be unmounted.\nPlease help me! Thank you.\n\nA: You've probably booted the recovery system from the recovery partition of the partition you're trying to merge/delete, so the recovery partition is getting in the way of repartitioning.\nHow I'd handle this situation depends on whether you've got another Mac and an appropriate macOS installer app handy.\nAssuming this is your only Mac, as a safety net, I'd install macOS to an external drive of some kind. A spare USB HDD, or a large enough flash drive (USB stick, SD card, etc.) will do the trick - 32GB is plenty, 16GB is in theory enough too but I'm not sure the installer will allow it. Then I'd boot from that external OS instance and download the macOS installer app from the App Store, or check that the external OS has a working recovery environment. Wipe the internal drive - if Disk Utility won't cooperate, use the command line equivalent: diskutil erase (after checking the disk number, e.g. disk0, using diskutil list).\nThe macOS installer should now make the freshly erased internal SSD available as an install target.\nIf you've got another Mac and an appropriate cable handy, the easiest solution is probably creating a macOS installer flash drive using the other Mac and then booting that installer on your MBP. You can then erase the disk using either Disk Utility or diskutil from the installer environment's Terminal, and select the freshly erased disk in the installer.\n", "Q: Command line utility for browsing Apple's Photos.app database like a filesystem Is there a command line utility to allow browsing and editing photos in the Apple's Photos.app database like you would browse a file system? The Photos app is really terrible when trying to perform operations on large data sets (in my case, delete all of the thumbnails that I accidentally imported) as it foolishly tries to load all of the photo metadata into memory when making selections of matching files to perform any select and this brings my computer to a halt as it allocates 101 GB of virtual memory and it just sits there paging for hours.\nI have tried to use third party de-duplication tools, but they are all terrible. I really just want to perform some basic operations on them using tools like exiv2 and GraphicsMagick to write some shell scripts to do get what I need done so I don't have to put up with Apple's nonsense with Photos. \nAny ideas? I have not found anything yet. Honestly, a Fuse plugin would be ideal, but alas such a thing does not seem to exist.\n\nA: osxphotos is a Python app that uses Apple's PhotoKit to let you query & export asset files, original or modified, plus all the various metadata from the Photos library.  I haven't used it yet, but it looks promising.  There's a command-line utility and a Python interface to the API.\nI'm not sure if this alone is enough to de-duplicate with; it seems to mostly be read-only.  One could find duplicates with it, delete them from the filesystem with normal Unix tools, and then ask the Photos app to clean up the dead links in its own database.  I strongly urge you to make a backup before you try that. =)\n", "Q: Macbook Pro internal hard drive issues, any way to get this working? Apologies for myself, I'm a new member and clueless about Macs in general.\nI have inherited a 2010 Macbook Pro and I've been hoping to use it for some light work.\nThe old password to the computer was lost so I figured I would just reinstall the OS. I don't have any install disks so I booted into Internet Recovery.\nThe High Sierra installation seemed to be going good, but about halfway through the installation, it would restart and give me the question mark folder.\nI booted into disk manager and noticed the hard drive was not showing up. After a bit of research I saw that the hard drive cables were notorious for failing, so I ordered a new one and put it in along with an SSD I had laying around. I went back into disk manager but the drive still won't show up. Fair enough, I figured maybe the SSD wasn't compatible(?) so I put the original drive back in. After booting to internet recovery, it displays a loading bar, then when it finishes, it restarts and boots to the question mark folder, never going into the recovery menu.\nI figured now my only option was to install the OS on an external drive. I tried the original drive in an enclosure and it would finally show up in disk manager, but after formatting it, the installer tells me the computer is \"missing a firmware partition\" A little more research tells me I need the firmware partition to be on an internal drive, which the computer cannot read.\nI'm at a loss, I understand why the computer needs the firmware to be on an internal drive but I feel there's got to be a way for me to at least get an OS up and running so I can test the computer a little better.\nThanks so much for any suggestions!\nEDIT:\nI feel like a dope, I chose the APFS option when formatting and I think it's now able to install to the external drive. Not sure what the issue is with reading the internal drive still.\n\nA: I would start again to see if you can test the MacBook Pro's hardware (including the internal drive). This is also a good idea anyway because of its age and the fact you don't know the history of this Mac. \nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: The extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nAssuming you find no problems, I would then reset the NVRAM of your Mac as well. Before doing so, unplug all external devices (including monitors, keyboard, etc).\nResetting NVRAM on your model MacBook Pro\nYour Mac use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store a whole range of settings. Here’s how to reset this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionPR keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac tries rebooting again.\n\n*Let go of the keys and see if your Mac boots up (not likely).\n\n\nAssuming it doesn't boot, try again to install macOS onto the internal drive to see if it makes any difference.\nFinally, if you couldn't get Apple Hardware Test to work at all, but you do now have macOS installed on an external drive, you could boot up from that and see if you can run Disk Utility to test and/or repair the internal drive. Assuming you can do this and it passes, you could then try installing macOS again onto the internal drive while you're booted from your external drive.\n", "Q: Vim like navigation keys for Finder So I use vim all the time, and I've grown use to the navigation keys h, j, k, l, (especially when navigating with NERDTree).\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to implement this motion in macOS Finder.app?\nI thought of remapping the keys using something like Karabiner or BetterTouchTool, but in either case, I would not be able to use those keys when renaming a file.\n\nA: Vim can get addictive once we get the hang of it. To vim-ify the Finder is a lovely idea.\nHowever, what features are you thinking about? For example, browsing files using the navigation keys h, j, k, l, then pressing i to enter edit mode and rename files or folders?\nVim’s power lies in text mode, whereas macOS interface is designed to be used with a mouse/trackpad. It may be better to stick with vim to process textual information, and to use mouse/trackpad in a graphical environment.\nBy the way, I cannot see a simple and effective way to hack the Finder (as you said Karabiner is fantastic, but it just won't do it). It would probably require to program a specific macOS Finder utility using Swift.\nAlternatively:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some code editors can be controlled the vim way, like Sublime Text with enabling the Vintage Mode.\n\n*Web browsers can be controlled the vim way: Chrome with Vimium or cVim, Firefox with Vimium-FF or Vim Vixen (thanks to @Ruslan and @wchargin for mentioning it)\n\n*The bash shell running in Terminal.app can be used in vi mode using set -o vi or set editing-mode vi.\n\n*There are great textual file managers ready to install via Homebrew that worth a try, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*nnn.

Try it logging out first and checking.\n\n\nThe \"Mohave.heic\" file is located in the /Library/Desktop Pictures directory. Changing that file will edit the default background for each user but not edit the login background image. \n\nA: This does actually still work, in 10.14.4 at least.\nAre you using FileVault?\nIf you are, you'll need to make some change that updates the boot mini-system. (At the FileVault login screen, your system isn't actually booted up all the way - it can't, because your boot disk is encrypted! It's running its own mini-system off another volume.)\nIf this is your problem, you'll see the default image at boot, but your custom background at subsequent login screens (i.e. if you go to the login window again after logging in).\nThe easiest way to update the background on the mini-system is by changing your user icon image.\n", "Q: Has Apple ditched the enter key symbol in their mac devices international keyboard?

After resetting my Mac from a backup (High Sierra, version 10.13.6), I somehow lost the preview.app. It's not there. I still see remnants like com.apple.Preview.plist (yet, no com.apple.preview folder). What can be done to get it back without installing macOS anew?\nthx\n\nA: The Preview app should be in /Applications, with all the other apps. It cannot be deleted normally, so it is strange that it is missing. What happens if you double click on an image file or PDF? What happens if you type \"Preview\" into Spotlight? Is it missing from Launchpad?\nFirstly, you should be able to restore it from your backup. Go into Time Machine app, navigate to the Applications folder, and then scroll 'back in time' until you can see it. Then Restore.\nIf that fails, then I would be incline to reinstall MacOS, because there may well be all sorts of other issues that you have not discovered.

I need to convert about 500k emails into searchable PDFs. By 'searchable' I mean that macOS will be able to scan them for specific words rather than simply treating them as an image. My searches, thus far, for a tool to do this have ended in proprietary database apps and over-priced sketchball x-to-pdf converters which basically perform the built-in macOS functionality of Print To PDF. Is there a single tool or two complementary tools that could be used together in Terminal to just batch convert all the emails to searchable PDFs?\n\nA: I had to do this with ~180 emails, and I used a command tool I found on GitHub that converts .eml to .pdf via .html: https://github.com/nickrussler/eml-to-pdf-converter\nIt takes a little while to convert each .eml file - 22 minutes for 186 emails with lots of images - so it's probably not helpful for a 500k email task.

Game developers are unlikely to add support for AirPlay just for audio.  If they do support AirPlay, it would probably be to do screen mirroring or dual screen to an AppleTV.\nAlso, only one app at a time can use the AirPlay stream.  So even if there was a game that supported just audio to AirPlay speakers, you would not be able to have iTunes streaming to the AirPlay speakers at the same time.\nThis is documented by Apple for developers: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/airplay/overview/media-playback/\n\nStream only expected content. Disable streaming of content like background loops and short video experiences that only make sense within the context of your app itself. \n\nThe breakdown between game sounds that play locally and soundtracks that are presented through AirPlay is here: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AirPlayGuide/EnrichYourAppforAirPlay/EnrichYourAppforAirPlay.html\n\nSend Audio Where It Belongs\nApps typically use two types of sound—app audio (such as ambient sounds, background music, and incidental noises) and system sounds (such as key clicks and alert sounds). AirPlay attempts to deliver the app audio to a remote sound system while keeping system sounds on the host, so that feedback sounds remain local to the input device.\nIf your app uses system sound APIs for app audio, AirPlay does not redirect them to the AirPlay-enabled sound system. The result is a less-than-optimum user experience. It is important to use system sound APIs only for system sounds. For app audio, use APIs such as AVAudioPlayer.\n\n", "Q: Do Time Capsules still work with macOS 10.14 (Mojave) Do Apple Time Capsules still work with macOS 10.14 (Mojave).\nMore specific: Can I use them for wireless Time Machine backups without jumping through hoops I would not have to with Mac OS X 10.6 (the last OS I used with a Time Capsule).\nIf not all of them work, which do?\n\nA: I have an old Time Capsule that I’ve had for years.  Recently, I updated my laptop to Mojave and my Time machine backups still continue to work with the Time Capsule.  So the answer is, yes Mojave works with Time Capsules.  One thing to note is that Time Machine can only backup to HFS+ formatted disks.  So make sure that the Time Capsule disk is formatted as HFS+.  Which, I think, is its default format.\n", "Q: 2015 Macbook Pro display goes blank but machine continues to run and fans continue to go even if I close lid I have a 2015 Macbook Pro that seems to turn the display off after it reaches a specific temperature.  Is this a reasonable conclusion?  \nInitially I thought I had to change the logic board completely and figured it was full on hardware failure.  I tried closing opening the lid, tried messing with the display dimming, tried resetting SMC and PRAM, tried posting on Apple and asking them.  Nothing worked.  So rather than pull the whole thing apart and find a replacement logic board and replacing that I bought a new macbook pro 2018 and gave up on the 2015.\nI needed some pictures off the old machine and began looking for a way to get the data off the 2015.  I started looking for a converter to transfer the data off the proprietary SSD.  I thought I would try to start the machine up again after about 6 months and the display came up asked me to log in and I did, everything was working fine for about two minutes then screen just goes black, machine still runs just no display.  Hard shut down then restarted worked fine for about 30 secs then blank screen.  Hard shut down left it overnight and then came back and restarted next day worked fine for about 3 mins. enough time to get my files  to the cloud and get the stuff I needed.  But it seems that all my hardware is working fine up to a point.  I've been able to run it sometimes up to about 10 mins, even updated the OS but eventually the display will just turn itself off and I have to repeat the process of hard shut down letting cool itself then restart.\nSo my questions are: Should I pull the heat sync and put some new paste on the cpu and gpu and see if that will help?  Has anyone else encountered this issue?  Any other thoughts on what might be happening here?  Any other idea about how I can cool the machine better or if I should not even mess with trying to address this issue?  I love my old 2015 and would love to have it working again.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  Thanks.    \n\nA: You've already reset the System Management Controller and NVRAM (both logical first steps), but there's no mention of you testing the MBP in Safe Mode or of testing your hardware. \nNext I would probably start with testing to see if this behaviour is replicated when booted into Safe Mode and if the issue persists then running Apple Diagnostics.\nBoot into Safe Mode \nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP \n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does your MBP still behave the same way, etc) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal \n\n*Test again when booted normally \n\n\nIf the problem doesn't occur while booted into Safe Mode, let me know and we'll go from there. \nIf the problem persists, proceed with running Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead.

Why can't I find any official documentation for the file format? \nI've seen this link a lot, but it seems that they've taken whatever used to be there down.\nThe best I could find was some blog posts and this mirror of the older documentation on github. This information still seems to be accurate, but why did Apple take this down? Has the documentation been moved somewhere? Have they deprecated some of the information in that document or perhaps the file format as a whole?\nEdit I have been looking into this a bit more, and it seems like the mirrored documentation isn't actually completely up to do date.

Is there any way to convert a whole heap of .ogg files in about 30 folders in a folder containing those folders to .mp3 files and put them in another folder using the command ffmpeg? The previous methods I have tried all led to the same error: \"*.ogg no such file or directory\"\nIf possible could you please tell me how? I cant find anything relating to this specific question.\nEdit: I've tried to edit the command and now it's giving me this error:\n(this goes for all of the files in the folder)\n/Users/Macbook/Downloads/Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13/step/wood6.ogg~/Downloads/Minecraft\\ Sounds/step/wood6.mp3: No such file or directory\n\nI used this:\n$ for file in ~/Downloads/Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13/step/*.ogg \n> do\n>     fullfilename=$(basename \"${file}\")\n>     filename=\"${fullfilename%.*}\"\n>     ffmpeg -i \"$file\"\"~/Downloads/Minecraft\\ Sounds/step/$filename.mp3\"\n> done\n\nI think it's trying to link both directories together.\n\nA: Isn't it astonishing how such small problems create a bunch of solutions :-)\nDownload the ZIP file, then run\nunzip \"Minecraft Sound Pack 1.13.zip\" -d mc\ncd mc/\nfind . -type f -iname '*.ogg' -execdir sh -c \\\n    'ffmpeg -v 8 -i \"$1\" \"${1%.*}.mp3\" && rm -- \"$1\" && echo \"$1\"' sh {} \\;\n\nThis will replace all .ogg files with the .mp3 version, deleting the .ogg file in the process. You still have the original data in the ZIP file if needed.\n\n\n*\n\n*-type f ensures that only files get matched (otherwise a directory named foo.ogg would be passed to ffmpeg for processing as well)\n\n*The -execdir option runs the following command within the directory the file was found (so we don't need to worry about stripping path names)\n\n*Because -execdir can only run one command we start a new shell and pass the set of commands via -c\n\n*ffmpeg -v 8 -i \"$1\" \"${1%.*}.mp3\" && rm -- \"$1\" && echo \"$1\"is the actual command getting executed, with the name of the file to be converted as $1\n\n*sh {} are the parameters passed to the shell script as $0 and $1 respectively. sh is only required for syntactical reasons (you could put any word there, some people use _ for instance), {} gets replaced by the currently found file\n\n*\\; terminates the -execdir part (actually ; does, but it needs to get escaped from bash who would interpret it as a command terminator otherwise)\n\n\nPS: If you want to see the details from ffmpeg remove the -v 8 part.\n\nA: As an example, I have a bunch of .ogg files in my Downloads directory, so... to batch convert a bunch of .ogg files in a given directory to .mp3 files in the same directory, I did the following in Terminal:\ncd Downloads\nfor f in *.ogg; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.*}.mp3\"; done\n\nThis created an .mp3 file for each .ogg file I have in my Downloads directory.\nSo, using your directory path, do the following:\ncd ~/Downloads/Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13/step\nfor f in *.ogg; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.*}.mp3\"; done\n\n\nThat said and considering your dealing with a sound file pack you downloaded from the Internet, Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13.zip, which contains 131 directories, some nested 3 or more deep, and 1406 .ogg files, of which some of the filenames are the same, I would handle the situation with the following conditions in mind.\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13.zip file from the Internet.\n\n*Expanded the zip archive by double-clicking on it in my Downloads folder in Finder. Note that this is because I do not let the Browser unzip downloaded archive files. This also retains a copy of the zip archive in case I still need it afterwards.\n\n\nWith that done, I used the following example bash script to convert each .ogg file within the hierarchal folder structure to an .mp3 file at the same location. Then delete the .ogg files, as I still have the original zip archive.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n    # s=\"/Path/To/Source/Files\"\n\ns=\"$HOME/Downloads/Minecraft+Sound+Pack+1.13\"\n\nfor d in $(find \"$s\" -type f -iname '*.ogg' | sed -E 's|/[^/]+$||' | sort -u); do\n    cd \"$d\"\n    for f in *.ogg; do\n        ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.*}.mp3\"\n        rm \"$f\"\n    done\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You only need to change the value of s=\"...\" as or if needed and as a general rule I like to use $HOME in place of ~.\n\n\nNote that this is just how I choose to deal with the situation in the moment and there are many different ways that a script could be written.  This however I believe achieves the end goal of having the hierarchal folder structure of the 131 directories intact with the 1406 converted .mp3 files.\nBy the way... On my old MacBook Pro, (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, it took just under 9 minutes to process the 1406 .ogg files.\n\nA: Using the base logic in the post, Suggestions for a batch audio converter?, we just have to do a simple nested for/do loop to iterate through each of your directories.  Assuming the best case scenario that the directories are only one child directory deep and the files are pretty clean (nothing other than .ogg) this script will automatically convert the files for you.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nbase_dir=\"~/Downloads\"\nnewbase_dir=\"~/Downloads/New Sounds\"\n\ncd \"$base_dir\"\nfor dir in */\ndo\n  for file in *\n  do\n    fullfilename=$(basename \"${file}\")\n    newfilename=\"${fullfilename%.*}\"\n    echo\n    echo \"Converting ${file} to $newfilename.mp3\n    ffmpeg -i \"$file\" \"${newbasedir}/${dir}/${filename}.mp3\"\n  done\ndone\n\nScript Logic\nBasically, it will iterate through each file in each directory processing it through ffmpeg converting from .ogg to .mp3 keeping the directory structure of the original.  There are two variables you need to set:\n\n\n*\n\n*base_dir - the starting point of where the files are located\n\n*new_base_dir - the directory where you want all the files to end up.\n\n\nIf you don't want the directory structure kept, just rewrite the ffmpeg line to read:\nffmpeg -i \"$file\" \"${newbase_dir}/${filename}.mp3\"\n\n", "Q: What is the purpose of speculative memory?

It's very strange that the memory is an official darwin memory metric, but no one says for it.\nWhat's the purpose of this mertric unless used for any purpose?\n\nA: Speculative memory (introduced with OS X 10.5) means that the kernel has marked a specific page of memory as being \"speculative\" - meaning that it is stored by the kernel because it predicts that it probably will be used for something later, but it hasn't happened yet. I.e. the kernel is speculating that reading something now will benefit it later.\nIn practice this occurs when the macOS kernel detects that it (because of application requests) are reading in a sequential manner from a disk drive. For example if an application reads block number 1, 2 and 3 - it is fair to assume that there's a high probability that the next block to be read is nummer 4. It might not be, but it is likely to happen.\nThe reason the kernel tries to detect this is that in many cases it is \"cheaper\" (in terms of performance) to read in larger blocks from the disk, and/or issue multiple requests to the drive for many blocks at the same time - rather than issuing them one at a time. Also it is possible for the kernel to request blocks from disk while the application itself is actually busy doing something else and hasn't asked for the block yet.\nThe idea behind speculative pages is thus to \"prefetch\" or \"read ahead\" on the disk and store these in memory, so that when the application later asks for the data, it can be provided very quickly. The current macOS kernel has different optimizations for ordinary hard disk drives and SSD drives in terms of when a prefetch is triggered, and how much is actually prefetched at a time.\nThe kernel marks these pages as \"speculative\", which is different from regular disk caching, because it knows that this is just a performance optimization on data that hasn't really been requested yet. So if the computer is lacking memory for other purposes, the speculative pages can be thrown out with little or no performance penalty at all.\nIn practice the kernel reads in the data into speculative pages and marks it as \"protected\" meaning that it won't be that easily thrown out under memory pressure. As the speculative pages age (i.e. time passes) they are moved from \"bin to bin\" so that older pages are stored together. When they reach a certain age, they are no longer protected - and can be readily discard if memory is needed for other purposes. \nHowever, if an application actually uses the data that has been put in the speculative pages, they're immediately remarked as no longer speculative, and put in one of the other categories as relevant.\nIf you want you can completely disable speculative pages by setting speculative_reads_disabled to 1 with sysctl.\nThe reason statistics are made seperately for speculative pages so that it is not lumped together with free pages or the ordinary disk cache is that you can use it to measure if speculation is really being used on your machine, and how much, and you have a better idea on how much memory is actually being used by the applications - and not just by the kernel trying to optimize for performance.\n", "Q: MacOS - turning off the bash session restore I’ve tried editing /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal as well as adding files such as .bash_profiles, etc to my home folder but my session history keeps showing - when I open terminal, it will open 3 windows with its history.

I have the app File Explorer on my iphone which lets me access and stream files to my iphone while my Windows computer and Iphone is connected to the same network. I access my Windows computer using a local IP i.e. 192.168.0.x.\nHowever, when I am away from home and not connected to my network, using mobile data, naturally I cant access my home computer anymore from my iphone using File Explorer because its using the local IP of the Windows computer to connect. The only way I can still access the computer is through the Google Remote Desktop iphone app, but that gives me an interface I can barely control through an iphone screen.\nWhat I want to do is use File Explorer to access my home computer from my iphone while I am away, that is while the wifi on my iphone is not used, only using mobile data. This works with Google Remote Desktop but so far I cant do it with File Explorer.\n\nA: Actually what you are trying to do has nothing to do with Apple products, per-se. But is a fairly common task and something that I used to do when I hosted my own website off an old Mac attached to my home network.\nThis applies to any networked device that needs to access another networked device from outside one of the networks, like this.\niPhone --> Internet --> Your home network --> Your PC\nThe trick here is that you have to configure your home router to forward specific connection requests from outside to specified devices inside your network. This is commonly known as port forwarding and the linked article on Wikipedia will give you some info on the theory of how it works.\nMost home routers that cable companies provide allow you to set up port forwarding. And every single one of them is different. So you will have to consult your ISP (they may have articles on how to do this available online) on how to do it with your specific make and model of router.\nYou will then need to set up your Windows PC with a static IP address and point the ports you are forwarding to that PC.\nYou will need to search out what ports the Apple Files.app uses and forward those ports on your router to the IP address of your PC.\nNot to mention setting up a DNS name for your system as your router's internet accessible IP address will change from time to time. There are free services that can do this too.\nI have never done what you are trying to do, this is just a basic overview of the process.\nOne thing you will have to take into consideration is that you are opening up your PC to the entire internet. So at a minimum you will need a good strong password on that file share. And you will also need to hope that some bored hacker doesn't find your system and try and break in and destroy your PC from somewhere in Romania.\nHonestly, your best bet (and easiest route) is to do what Nimesh said in his first comment, use Dropbox, Google Drive, or any other similar service to do this. Introductory tiers of these services are often free and a LOT easier than setting up your own Internet accessible file share on your home PC.\nAlso I believe there are home NAS units that come with software that will do this. Also easier than what you are planning.\n", "Q: Internal macbook pro microphone not working on any browser, but working in apps (skype, slack, photo booth) Specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n\n*macOS Mojave v10.14.2\n\n*chrome version  71.0.3578.98 \n\n*safari version 12.0.2\nUsing this website I can see the line but it isn't moving.

Instead I used an alternate method. Scroll down to see the alternate method.\nI'm looking for a solution to mute my mic in Discord that I can then add to my touchbar via bettertouchtool.\nBTT cannot send key combos to Discord for whatever reason. As far as I can tell I have two options. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use applescript to activate the Discord window, send the key press, then hide the window. This works, but flashing the application up for a moment is annoying. Worse when it's on another desktop as it will flip desktops over and then back.\n\n*Use applescript to click the top menu  to click the Discord menu, and work down through the UI elements to click the Mute button.\nI'm not experienced enough with applescript to make the second option work, but I think it could work. Using UI browser I was able to get the path to the UI element:\n\nHow can I make this work? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\nALTERNATE SOLUTION What I am wanting to do here does not appear to be possible, so I'm just muting my mic at the OS level instead of Discord, and then adding a toggle button to my touchbar with BetterTouchTool. This has the added benefit of working system wide. Here's video of it in action:\n\n\nStreamable\nIn case anyone else was wanting to do this these are the steps I took:\n1. Create a new Applescript with the following script:\nproperty storedInputLevel : missing value\nif input volume of (get volume settings) is 0 then\n    set volume input volume storedInputLevel\n    return 1\nelse\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set storedInputLevel to input volume of (get volume settings)\n    end tell\n    set volume input volume 0\n    return 2\nend if\n\nSave the script somewhere.\n2. Open up Better Touch Tool and create a new Touch Bar widget and set the widget to Run Apple Script and Show Return Value\n\n3. In the window that pops up after selecting Run Apple Script and Show Return Value you'll want to erase the test line in the box and give your widget a name:\n\n3.a Click the appearance and settings button\n\n4. In the Appearance and Settings window you'll want to configure the following settings:\n\nYou don't need to set an alternate background color, but it helps to see you're muted at a glance.\nFor the icons you can use these:\n\nMake sure that you set the Alternate color and icon if result matches regex setting to 2.\nClick Save. \n5. On the new widget you created click on the drop down for Predefined action and choose Run Apple Script (async in background).\n\n6. In the window that popped up you'll want to click on Select Apple Script File and then Choose Apple Script file from Disk and browse to the script file you created earlier. Click save and you're done.\n\nThat's it. Your widget should toggle your mic on and off and the change should be reflected in the icon on your touch bar.\n\nA: Firstly, well done for exploring and doing your own research with which you've come armed to ask how it can be applied to form a solution.  It makes it so much easier to provide useful help.\nWith that in mind, the screenshot from UI Browser is immensely helpful, as it literally lays out the hierarchy of UI elements that we need to traverse in order to reach the target menu item and issue a click via AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Discord\"\n        tell menu bar 2\n            tell menu bar item 1\n                click\n\n                tell (a reference to menu 1)\n                    repeat until it exists\n                        delay 0.2\n                    end repeat\n                    tell menu item \"Mute\"\n                        click\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nHowever, there is a known and well-queried/documented/complained-about phenomenon of an irritating 5-second inexplicable delay between the first click that shows the menu, and the second click that selects the menu item.  This isn't specific to Discord, but seems to apply to menu bar icon menus.\nVarious solutions have been put forward to workaround this, but I won't go into them in detail because none of them are a) reliable, b) without side-effects, or c) clean to implement.  You'll undoubtedly do a quick search yourself, and come upon the most common solution, which is to kill the System Events process between the first two click events.  But you'll find upon further reading that later on, users report that this method stops working; and in the interrim, causes System Events to throw other, unrelated errors where it didn't before.\nTherefore, this solution for you is bittersweet, I'm afraid.  I've shown you how to AppleScript your way to the menu item you want; but the end result may not be any more appealing than your first option.\nEDIT: Possible Non-AppleScript Solution\nHaving downloaded a copy of Discord myself to see what's what, I first note that my version of the application has no such menu bar icon to speak of.  It must be a setting I haven't gleaned upon.\nWhat I did glean upon, however, is the option to set a user-defined keybinding that triggers one of a selection of functions, one of which being a toggle for the mic mute:\n\nHere, I set up one to bind ⌘⌥⇥ to Toggle Mute.  As you'd expect, it works within the application.  Surprisingly, it works outwith the application too, when it doesn't have focus, and even when it's minimised.  Even more surprisingly, it worked when Discord was resident on a separate desktop (space), and at no point did the Discord app need to attain focus or the active desktop be switched away from.\nI believe this is exactly the solution you're after - a hotkey that operates globally on your system to mute your Discord microphone.\n\nA: After a huge amount of frustration and none of the proposed solutions working for me, I solved the issue by making a Better Discord plugin that listens for a change to a .txt file simply containing a 0 or a 1. When the text file contains 1, it will mute, when it contains 0, it will unmute. Then I just made 2 applescripts that get and set the text file, respectively. Those are implemented using MTMR. It works pretty well! In the future, I intend to see about having the button disappear when no call is active.\n", "Q: Xcode 10 runs really slow and slows my entire computer down I'm currently using Xcode 10.1 and it's driving me crazy, it slows my computer down to a point that it is unusable.

I know how to disable and enable SIP, but is there an easier way to remove ACLs from a user's library?  I want to move and/or copy some things from my admin account to my regular account and SIP prevents even sudo from doing it.\nFour shutdown/reboot cycles just for this is a nuisance.\n\nA: First, of all you do not need 4 cycles. To enable SIP, you can enter the command below, then restart the Mac.\ncsrutil clear\n\nYou should get the message shown below.\nSuccessfully cleared System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.\n\nYou can disable SIP on a single restart, if you install rEFInd. If properly installed, you can select rEFInd from the Mac Startup Manager. From the rEFInd menu, you can disable SIP and then boot to macOS.\nSo to summarize, you can enable or disable SIP though a single restart. So the total number of cycles can be reduced from 4 to a  total of 2.\nAs for coping files from one users account to another, I do know were SIP is involved. If one of the accounts has administrator privileges, then you can enter the command below to become the root user.\nsudo bash\n\nOnce you are the root user, you can enter the necessary commands to copy files between accounts. \nPersonally, I do not employ the root user.

But in macOS Mojave the test returns false even for root.  \nIf I run that test [ -w File ] on other files with the same permissions and ownership, such as /etc/hosts , it correctly returns true for root and false for anyone else in both Mojave and High Sierra.  I see no special file flags or extended attributes on /etc/passwd.  \nThe script is no problem to fix, but I'd like to know how/why this test is different on that file vs other files and why this is in Mojave only.  If this has to do with SIP, then I'd like to know how one can test to see if a file or directory is somehow protected by SIP.\nUpdate: I found that disabling SIP made things work as expected, that is, for a root user the bash test \"-w /etc/passwd\" would be true.  Enabled SIP again and all is working as expected.  I don't know if I should delete this question, or leave it just in case someone runs into a similar problem.  Doing an \"ls -O /etc/passwd\" does not show the file as restricted.\n\nA: Checking to see if a file is \"writable\" as a way to determine if a user is root is a bad way to check permissions.  For instance....\n\n*\n\n*you can add a user to a group (i.e. wheel) that has write permissions to a file that's normally owned by root\n\n\n*a file can be flagged to not have write permissions even by root even though you have root access.\n\n\n*a file may have had its permissions changed to \"non-writable\" by root (intentionally or not)\n\n\n*SIP, or System Integrity Protection (as you've already discovered) will prevent even the root user from writing to system files.\nCheck for the User ID\nInstead, you should look at the UID of a particular user with the function id\n$ id -u\n\nA root user, will have an ID of 0.\nTo see how you can use this in a script to check for root privileges, see the answer in the post Running a Script with Administrator Privileges.\nChecking SIP\nThis is actually pretty easy....\n$ csrutil status\n\nHowever, if it is enabled, you will have to boot to Recovery Mode to disable SIP.

One of my friends likes it, and asked me to share it with him. I asked him to search by the name on the App Store, but he was unable to do so.\nHow do I share the app with him? Is there a quick and simple way to do so?\nI am using an iPhone 8 and my friend is using an iPhone 7.\n\nA: Update (September 2019)\nSome of the information provided in the answer is no longer valid (specifically discussed in point #1), due to the changes introduced in the subsequent releases of iPhone hardware and iOS 13 software. They are discussed in the latter part of the answer.\nThe original answer applies well to iPhone equipped with 3D Touch hardware capability, and running iOS 12 or earlier supported version of iOS. Here's a list of iPhone that shipped with 3D Touch hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6s/6s Plus\n\n*iPhone 7/7 Plus\n\n*iPhone 8/8 Plus\n\n*iPhone X\n\n*iPhone XS/XS Max\n\nOriginal Answer\nIt is not possible to share an app directly from one iPhone (iOS device) to another. What can be done instead is to share the App Store link for the app. Your friend can then install the app from the App Store onto their iPhone. There are different ways you can share the App Store link with your friend. I'll list them down, starting with the simplest and quickest one.\n1. Using 3D Touch Quick Actions:\niPhone 6s and newer (excluding iPhone XR), namly 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, X, XS, XS Max include a feature called 3D Touch. It gives users an additional mechanism to interact with the iPhone by using pressure to peek into and pop open content on iPhone. This is a hardware feature built into the display, and is not available on any other iOS device (iPod touch, iPad mini, iPad and iPad Pro).\nYou can use use Quick Actions to easily and quickly share the link for the app with your friend. On your iPhone, go to the Home Screen, locate the app, and apply a little pressure on the app icon until the iPhone gives a haptic feedback and reveals the Quick Actions menu like this:\n\nNow simply tap on the Share Odyssey item to reveal the Share Sheet. You can AirDrop the link to the app to your friend, which will directly reveal the app in the App Store on your friend's iPhone. He/She can simply proceed to install it.\n\nTo use AirDrop, you'll need to ask your friend to enable it on their iPhone. AirDrop can be turned on by going to Settings app → General → AirDrop and tapping on Contacts Only or Everyone. AirDrop can also be turned on from the Control Centre (revealed by swiping from the bottom of the screen on the model of your and friends iPhone).\nThis is the quickest, easiest and the most newbie friendly way to share an app from one iPhone to another.\n2. From your App Store purchase history:\nOpen the App Store app on your iPhone. Now tap on your profile picture shown at the top right. Tap Purchased to see the list of all the apps that you have bought and are linked with your Apple ID. Make sure All section is selected at the top.\n\nNow locate the app in question from the list. You can also use the Search facility if your list of apps is lengthy. Once you have filtered down to locate the app, tap on the app icon to reveal the App Store page. Now tap on the blue circular button with three dots to reveal the action sheet. Tap on Share App... item to open the Share sheet. You can choose the usual sharing options to share the app with your friend (AirDrop, Messages etc.).\n\n3. Searching on the App Store:\nQuite often, the display name of an app (the one shown below the app icon) differs from the actual name. Searching the App Store by the display name shows the app in the results in most cases (you may have to scroll through in some cases). To search for the app, open the App Store app, tap on the Search item and enter the app display name in the search bar.\n\nOnce you have located the app under the search results, simply tap on the icon to reveal the App Store page for the app. Now tap on the blue circular button with three dots to reveal the action sheet. Tap on Share App... item to open the Share sheet. You can choose the usual sharing options to share the app with your friend (AirDrop, Messages etc.).\n4. Searching on the Web and sharing the link:\nYou can also search by the app name or the display name on Web using a query similar to \"app name + iTunes link\" (Odyssey + iTunes link in this case). This is sometimes more efficient than searching on the App Store. (There's no right or wrong approach, the search logic for App Store and Web search work differently).\n \nNow once you have the link for the app, you can share it by any suitable means as discussed above with your friend. When searching on Web on your iPhone, tapping on the link opens it directly in the App Store app.\n\nThe app in question is a beautifully designed game called Alto's Odyssey. You can share the following App Store link for the game with your friend:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409\n\nUpdate\n3D Touch, a hardware feature has been subsequently been removed from the recent generation of iPhone. The functionality is simulated using a software based feature called Haptic Touch. Instead of detecting a physical pressure on screen, long tap is detected, and the device provides a Haptic feedback using the build in Taptic Engine in iPhone 6s and later (barring iPhone SE). Here's a screenshot from an iPhone 7 running iOS 13 with Haptic Touch in action for sharing App Store link to an installed 3rd party app.\n\nLong press was earlier reserved to make the app icons wiggle, so that users can easily uninstall or rearrange apps, move them into folders and rename folders. As Haptic Touch has taken over it in iOS 13, the options are now made available in a similar menu as peak menu shown earlier. While earlier, an app could only display a share command, now every 3rd party apps shows at leat two commands, namely, Rearrange Apps and Share App.\nPerforming either a 3D Touch or a long tap on the devices that have the 3D Touch hardware, presents the same peek context menu.\niPhone XR, introduced in the year 2018 was the first iPhone to get rid of the 3D touch hardware, while the concurrently introduced iPhone XS and XS Max retained it. 2019 line of iPhone, namely, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max all got rid of the 3D Touch hardware. They all rely on Haptic Touch to offer the similar functionality as discussed in point #1 above.\nOne of the earlier iPhone models, namely iPhone SE lacked 3D Touch hardware but supports running iOS 13. Since Haptic Touch is a software based feature, it received the similar functionality, which was not available previously.\n\n\nP.S.: A quick and informative guide on difference between Haptic Touch and 3D Touch can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Haptic Touch vs 3D Touch: What's the Difference?\n", "Q: macOS counterpart of Windows startup batch file My friend pranked me by creating a batch file which opens a YouTube video and added it to the startup folder, so that the batch file launches every time I log in. This is what he wrote in the batch file:\nTIMEOUT 1\nstart /min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kob0G2hE8IY\n\nOn top of that, he scheduled the batch file to run every 10 minutes using Task Scheduler.\nThis is done on a Windows PC. So my question is, how do you do the same thing on a Mac?\n\nA: The macOS counterpart is an AppleScript. You can create an AppleScript using Automator app and configure it to run upon system startup by going to System Preferences → Current User → Login Items.\nTo create the AppleScript, launch Automator.app. Under Library (in the left pane), select Utilities. From the centre pane, drag and drop Run Apple Script action into the pane shown towards right. Now enter the following script into the editor:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    tell window 1\n        set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kob0G2hE8IY\"})\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis is how the final result will look like:\n\nNow save the workflow by selecting File → Save... command.

I've tired various common methods (e.g. renaming to the same keyword); but none have worked.\n\nA: From this Apple Discussion:\n\nTo merge two keywords \"key1\" and key2\" I would create a smart album with the rule \"keyword is key1\" or \"keyword is key2\". Then assign the new merged keyword to the photos in this smart album.\n  And then delete both old keywords in the edit mode of the keyword manager.\n  It is no problem to create a temporary smart album with \"File > new smart album\" for the search and to delete it when you are done. I keep one smart album that I always use for searching.\nIf you are using iCloud Photo Library this may result in a very long period of syncing, if you have to change the keyword in many photos.\n\n", "Q: Transfer non-purchased Kindle e-books I have an old iPad mini with the Kindle app that my brother downloaded e-books on. Now I have a new iPad mini 4 and I can't seem to transfer the books to it.\nI haven't bought these books on Amazon because they were downloaded from my brothers computer.\n\nA: There's no way you'll be able to transfer the e-books from the old iPad mini to the new iPad mini 4. You'll at-least need access to the Amazon account that was used to sign into the Kindle app on the old iPad mini.\nKindle allows you to read personal documents and e-books which have been uploaded to the Amazon personal document storage service (without purchasing any e-book or paying anything). The content can be synced into the Kindle app installed on any supported device. But you'll need the login information of the Amazon account at a minimum.\nEven if you manage to backup the old iPad mini and restore it onto the new iPad mini 4, the Kindle app will be installed alright, but you'll still need to log into the new iPad mini with the Amazon account credentials which was used to setup the iPad mini.\nOnce you manage to register the new iPad mini 4 by logging in, you'll have access to the entire library of e-books and personal documents linked to the Amazon account.\nTo make it clear, the Amazon e-books and personal document content is no way related/linked to your Apple ID and no corresponding data is store in iCloud/Apple's servers.\n", "Q: Can I use a Verizon iPad mini with Wi-Fi only?

Is possible to install Windows 10 via bootcamp, on a drive that is not the main drive? I am running 10.11 (el capitan), which is the highest OS that my machine seems to be able to run.\nEDIT\nNo, I am not using an external drive, but an internal drive (the Mac Pro has 4 internal SATA bay for drives)\n\nA: Below is a quote taken from the Boot Camp\nInstallation & Setup Guide (copyright 2013).\n\n• If you have a Mac Pro with more than one internal disk and you want to install\n  Boot Camp on a disk that isn’t in the first hard drive bay, remove the drives in the lower- numbered bays. You can reinstall the drives after you install Boot Camp.\n\nSo, it is possible to install Windows via Boot Camp, on a drive that is not the main drive. The maximum Windows that Apple officially supports is Windows 8.1 (64-Bit). Microsoft says you should be able to upgrade an existing Boot Camp Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 10.\nEverything I have posted so far is by the book. However, you are proposing going off script by directly installing Windows 10. Officially, the answer is no, but unofficially the answer probably is yes. If you try, expect to encounter Scarecrows. In other words, expect error messages from Apple as some point during the installation that will say you can not proceed. There is usually are one or more ways to bypass any problems that you will encounter. You can try posting a problem here and see if anyone can suggest a solution.\nHere is some advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn the Windows 10 ISO to a DVD. You may need a DL DVD.\n\n*Install a BIOS booting Windows.\n\n*Before installing, make sure the Widows Support Software has been copied to a FAT formatted flash drive. \n\n*Select the Master Boot Record partitioning scheme when using the Disk Utility to erasing the flash drive.\n\n\n\nBTW, you do not need a license to try Windows 10. You can download and install without a Product Key. If you choose to keep Windows 10, then you will need to purchase a license.\n\nThere is always the possibility that Windows 10 is not compatible with your processor. I assume the Windows 10 installer would inform you, if this was the case. I have encountered PCs where I could install 64 bit Windows 7, 8 and 8.1, but not Windows 10. Basically, the processor did not meet the requirements given below. (This was taken from the Microsoft web site: Minimum hardware requirements, Section 3.1 Processor)\n\n\n*\n\n*Compatible with the x86 or x64 instruction set.\n\n*Supports PAE, NX and SSE2.\n\n*Supports CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and PrefetchW for 64-bit OS\ninstallation\n\n\nOn the other hand, I came across the Microsoft website: Windows Processor Requirements, which states:\n\nIntel Xeon processors are supported on Windows 10 Pro for Workstations and Windows 10 Enterprise only\n\nApparently, you can download and try Windows 10 Enterprise for free. See the Microsoft Evaluation Center website.\nIf you do not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Widows, then you should follow the instructions provided by Microsoft. For BIOS booting Windows, the instructions for partitioning can be found at the BIOS/MBR-based hard drive partitions website.\nI would recommend placing the System partition on the first (main) drive and then placing the Windows and Recovery partitions on a second internal drive. You could combine the Windows and Recovery partitions, if you wish. This System partition is only appropriately 100 MB in size, so the partition should have minimum impact on the space for macOS.\n\nNote: The Microsoft instructions do no include the Mac requirement that any drives that share macOS and a BIOS booting Windows must by Hybrid partitioned. \n\n", "Q: Why do I get \"Operation Not Permitted\" when I try (as root) to delete a file that does not have the `restricted` flag set I know about SIP, so when I could not delete a file as root from a Mac running El Capitan, I checked for a restricted flag using ls -lOd and saw that the file had no flags. So why is it that I still cannot delete it? The ls command also ruled out the uchg and schg flags and I'm doing this as root so I don't need to worry about chown. \n\nA: Turns out that in addition to the restricted flag, SIP protection can be invoked on a file by giving it the com.apple.rootless attribute. Attributes are not shown by ls -lOd, you need ls -l@d to see them. (Strictly speaking, the d option is not necessary, it is there so that when you do ls on a directory, you only get information about the directory itself without also getting info on everything in the directory.)\nMuch more information on this is available here.\n", "Q: Apple Maps: Renaming Favorites or Marked Locations There must be some really obvious trick which has escaped me.\nIf I favorite a marked location on MacOS Maps, or on iOS Maps, I can’t see how I can give it a custom name.\nTapping or clicking on Info doesn’t seem to help, and I can’t see any other method.\nI have tried the technique of selecting favorites from the search bar (in MacOS), selecting edit and trying, but the text remains uneditable.\nI would even consider a third party app if there is one.\nI am using MacOS Mojave, and iOS 12.\n\nA: To rename favorites in Maps on macOS (source):\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the magnifying glass in the search field\n\n*Click Favorites\n\n*Click \"Edit\" in the bottom right\n\n*Click on a Favorite's name to modify it\n\n*Press return or click out of the editing field, then click \"Done\"\n\n\nTo rename favorites in Maps on iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe up the \"card\" at the bottom that contains recent locations\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and tap on \"Favorites\"\n\n*Swipe from right to left across the favorite whose name you want to change, then tap \"Edit Name\"\n\n*Enter a new name, then tap \"Save\"\n\n\nI've tried both of these methods on macOS 10.14.2 and iOS 12.1.2 and confirmed that they both work.\n\nA: I am able to reproduce the broken icon buttons in Maps v3.0 (2684.21.9.22.1) on MacOS Monterey v12.0 (21A5543b)\nThe info button stops working for favorites if a user clicks any favorite info icon when any callout is open on the map.\nBug report: FB9754165 submitted: 12-Nov-21\nFix: restart Maps and ensure no callouts (pin details, user details, etc..) are open on the map when clicking an info icon.\n", "Q: Find files with the same content in one folder (and all its sub-folders) Say I have a folder named container and there are many files/sub-folders in it.

In short: no way.\nBut you can insert an SD card and format that as GUID, Mac OS extended (journaled)as a storage expansion.\nhere is an Apple article that describes the slot:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204384\nand here is an article that describes the uses for the SD slot:\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/3329753/macs/older-mac-sd-card-slot.html\nAltogether an easy and cheap solution for your \"problem\".\n\nA: Thanks for your advice. Its appreciated. Going for a 256GB SDXC card looks like the way forward. However i am curious. The article says that it uses the USB bus to drive the SD card so would just connecting the old drive as a USB external on the new mac give me the same result in terms of speed? Am i right in thinking that the only difference between the USB external and the SC card are that the card is more secure but the USB external just looks unsecure dangling off the side of the mac. but in theory acting and behaving in the same way?

This is by design.\nIf you do not have a fixed line connection with Wi-Fi access point, you can create a Wi-Fi hotspot on one of the other mobile phones.\nAlternatively, if you have access to a Mac, you can download and install the software update via iTunes and update the device. \n", "Q: Automator - automatically copy files/folders when tagged a specific custom label Being a Mac user, I really enjoy the simple feature of tagging files and folders. Its very useful to filter by tag to quickly access any files which I have tagged regardless of where they are located.\nI use this feature for images and audio. Any images or recordings I like, I tag it to keep track of them.\nHowever, I have been thinking about a simple feature that I would love to see and would like to see if this can be done with Automator at all or perhaps there exists a simple tool already.\nI would like to be able to automatically copy any files or folders to a specific location if they are tagged something specific, such as a custom label \"Backup\". So if I tag any file with the label \"Backup\" to then copy those files to my Dropbox directory or Google Drive directory.\nMy intention with this is to rather backup/sync curated content rather than everything. I would like to be able to go through my creative work and simply tag the files I like which then automatically get copied to wherever I sync them to the cloud.\nIn addition, it would be ideal for this to work for external devices as well. So if I connect a USB drive and tag any files there, they get copied to the destination.\nAny advice that might point me in the right direction would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Check out Taggy Tagger.\nIt is a macOS menu bar app which automatically tags files and copies/moves files to a specified folder.

Sadly this ability does not support watching for changes to tags:\n\nThe ability to watch folders and take action on incoming items is a powerful automation technique that enables the creation of fully unattended workflows. A watched folder might be used, for example, to watermark incoming photos, convert them to PDF, and email them to clients for review. Many companies set up script servers—dedicated robot machines that watch folders and process detected items, allowing employees to offload tedious and repetitious work in order to focus on other important tasks.\n\nResearch kqueue\nTry researching the underlying kqueue mechanism.

However, I now have data (eg, running database) that shouldn't be backed up while being changed, and I'd like to keep the applications changing them running during the backup.\nI know file system snapshot views exist to deal with this problem: Linux has the LVM approach and Apple has Time Machine. However, apparently only the former allows one to mount a snapshot as a virtual file system, so that it's possible to use tools like rsync, tar, or, for what matters, cp, against a view of the files frozen at a given time.\nI cannot find any such feature for macOS, tmutil/Time Machine don't look to be the same thing, they must be leveraging the snapshot functionality of their APFS file system, but I can't find any way to see a snapshot as a set of files. Is that possible for APFS?\nNote that I'm not interested at all in using Time Machine for my backups: I'm an advanced user and TM is too stupid to suit me fine (it doesn't work over SSH, it doesn't allow me to select a folder on a destination device, it doesn't seem to support multiple backup profiles, each with a different set of sources/destinations and different schedules), nor I'm so interested in spending money on things like SuperDuper!, just to do what that my scripts have done very well for years.\n\nA: Yes, it is definitely possible to view an APFS snapshot as a \"set of files\" - i.e. a file system. This is done simply by mounting the snapshot - exactly like you would do with LVM on Linux.\nThe syntax is:\n  mount_apfs -s <snapshot name> <mounted base volume> <mount folder>\n\nSo for example create a snapshot with:\n  tmutil snapshot /\n\nIt will say that the new snapshot is named for example: 2019-01-01-180510.\nThen later you can create a folder \"MyBackup\" and mount the snapshot like this:\n  mount_apfs -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-01-01-180510 / MyBackup\n\nIf you then browse MyBackup you'll see the files like they were at the time the snapshot was taken.\nNote: You don't have to use snapshots created by TimeMachine. Any APFS snapshots will be mountable with the same command.\n", "Q: Why does Safari sometimes bookmark a different URL? I noticed this in Wikipedia redirect pages using iOS 12.1.1\nFor example, if you open this URL\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UK&redirect=no\nThen use “Add bookmark” or “Add to Favorites”, iOS instead bookmarks this URL:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK\n(Wikipedia then automatically redirects it to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom .)\n“Add to Reading List” seemingly uses this amended URL too, while “Add to Home Screen” uses the unchanged https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UK&redirect=no .\nIs there a technical explanation for how/why this happens?\n\nA: \nThen use “Add bookmark” or “Add to Favorites”, iOS instead bookmarks this URL:\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK\n\nThe rest of the title is telling it not to redirect as it is a redirect page as is removed.\n\n(Wikipedia then automatically redirects it to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom .)\n\nThe page is a redirect page so it redirects it unless you put &redirect=no at the end of the title\n\n“Add to Reading List” seemingly uses this amended URL too, while “Add to Home Screen” uses the unchanged\n\nAdd to reading list is the same explanation while add to home screen just copies the link. \n\nA: I think I found it.

If I enable FileVault using a specific account on macOS Sierra, does the account have to be logged in for the initial encryption to take place or does the computer just have to be plugged in and awake even if a different user is logged in?\n\nA: It depends on the specifics on how you did this. If it is an internal disk that you booted from and the file system is mounted, then the computer just have to plugged in and awake. The encryption takes place in the background even when another user is logged in to the computer!\nOn the other hand, if it is an external drive that you unmount when logging out, the encryption will not continue when another user logs in.\nThe important thing here is whether or not the file system is mounted. It doesn't really matter if the drive is external or internal, but that is just how people treat these two types of drives in practice.\n", "Q: Syncing .apps via dropbox/resilio sync Is it a good idea to sync .apps so that I can have the same app on multiple Mac's? How often do .apps change, afaik, the app's data is stored the Library folder, so, except for updates, the .app should't change, or should it?\n\nA: Firstly, DropBox, Resilio sync and other such systems do have limitations about the types of files that they can sync. They may not sync certain file types, metadata, files with particular character sequences, and so on. You should read up on these, as this may affect syncing apps.\nSome apps can have components in /Library, and/or the User's Library. These components may get updated by an installer package.\nIf an app gets updated through syncing, but all these other components are not updated (which would have happened in an updater), then you might run into trouble if a newly synced app tries to read support files from an older version. (It's also unwise to sync severl areas in the Library folders, as these can be machine specific.)\nMy gut reaction is that it might cause unforeseen problems, and given that most apps either update themselves or use the Mac App Store to do so, (and are otherwise static) there's not really any compelling need to sync them.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 Keyboard and trackpad not detected once booted into operating system Ever since I updated my computer to macOS Mojave I’ve been experiencing issues. The issues all started at the same time and they include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer crashing after opening lid(Computer Transitioning from Sleep State\n\n*Trackpad feedback(the click from the Taptic Engine) stops randomly while using the computer\n\n*Trackpad and keyboard not detected by OS after reboot.\nIn the past most of the issues I was having were simply fixed by resetting the SMC or by simply rebooting the computer. Unfortunately at this point no matter how many times I reset the SMC, or reboot the computer, the internal keyboard and trackpad are not responding, even though the trackpad still makes a “click” from the Taptic Engine when clicked.\nI’ve attempted many things including rebooting the computer, SMC reset, PRAM/NVRAM reset(unsuccessful), system hardware test(unsuccessful), etc...\nThe reason certain resets and tests were unsuccessful is because the OS is unable to detect the keyboard, but others like the SMC do no require the OS to preform the reset so it functions.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on ways to solve this issue that doesn’t involve completely reinstalling macOS? \nComputer:\nMacBook Pro Mid 2015 13”\n\nA: I had the same issue and was able to fix it. For everyone having this issue, try solution from here:\nPress Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds. If you have a MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button.\n\n\nA: We had this problem, we took it to a service and they said this is a common problem with MBP2015. \nThere's a cable that connects the motherboard with the touchpad.\nThat cable can die over time.\nThey swapped it out and we could pick up the machine and it was up and running with working touchpad/keyboard in just 2 hours.\n\nA: In my case, the problem was indeed with the cable that connects the touchpad with the mainboard:\n\nThe cable could die over time as @EpicPandaForce said, or because of oxidation (if you spilled water on the keyboard).\nReplacing the cable will fix the problem.\n", "Q: How can I delete an app where no one realises I have downloaded it?

Long story short my old MBP died and I got a replacement MBK 2018 that has 2 of those Thunderbolt or USB-C connections but no mini display ports/usb/hdmi etc (i'm confused already)....  \nSo.. How do I connect both these VGA monitors to my MBP so they both work?  Neither have HDMI outputs.  The guy in the apple store told me about daisy chaining and wanted to sell me 'two' adapters at £75 quid each... \nAnyone any recommendations on how this is done?  Surely this cant be difficult but I cant seem to find any double VGA to Thunderbolt adapters... I'm not even sure if this is what I should be looking for. \nAny advice is welcomed, or a pointer to any adapters/hubs/connectors or whatever its called that can connect 2 VGA monitors to my MBP..  \n(BTW as you can probably tell, my expertise in all things connectory/hubby or adaptery is limited so keep the techy terms simple)\n\nA: You'll need two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C plug) adapters for VGA. These can be found from lots of different makers at varying prices - i.e. from \"unknown China\" to \"Belkin\" to \"Apple\" in terms of price ranges.\nIt would ofcourse be ideal if you could have an adapter that in itself offers dual-VGA - then you would only need to plug-in one cable instead of two. I have only seen very few of these, such as for example the HUB-V03 from Choetech. The problem with all of those I have seen is that they only support mirroring. I.e. both monitors will display the same image, which I believe is not what you want.\nIn general, you might want to consider buying new monitors instead of adapters. It will be more costly, but you'll often get much better quality displays as VGA-only monitors are generally old. One thing is the factory specs (i.e. newer monitors usually have one or more of higher resolution, wider color range, higher light intensity and/or lower power usage) - but take into account that modern monitors actually degrade over time. If your current monitor is 8 years old for example, chance is that it will break at some time - but it is an almost certainty that it currently has worse picture quality than when you bought it.\n", "Q: Can any Apple watch bands add extra features? I've got an Apple Watch series 3, and was wondering if any bands support extra \"features\", and don't just change the look?\nFor example, is it possible that any bands exist that enhance the vibration only mode so vibrations are stronger? \n\nA: I have a vague recollection of several attempts at \"feature\" bands when the original Apple Watch was released but I'm not sure many of them even made it into production. The only one I'm familiar with that is a shipping product is the KardiaBand.\nhttps://store.alivecor.com/products/kardiaband\nIt adds ECG features to Series 3 watches and predates similar features in the Series 4.\n\nA: Currently Apple has not opened up the port on the Apple Watch to developers so adding features via band is difficult. It should be possible but currently there it is not realistic. If Apple opens up the watchOS to give more access to developers, you should start seeing more interesting bands.\n", "Q: How to add additional \"contact me\" information to an apple-id For Christmas, our kids gave us a second iPad (new) to go along with our old first generation iPad.

I recently got this used iMac, and was hoping I could use it for development work. I had an old Mac OS X Snow Leopard install disk, which I used to upgrade as far as OS X El Capitan, and wasn't able to get farther than that.\nAt the time I thought this was fine; after all El Capitan isn't that old, right?\nBut apparently I was wrong. I've been working with Xcode recently, and everything was going fine until I started trying to install and use CocoaPods.\nMost of the pods nowadays have been updated to work with Xcode 9, and (only by a few little details), are not backwards-compatible with Xcode 8.2.1 (the farthest I've been able to get).\nSo, currently I see two ways to solve the problem (other than buying a new Mac, which I don't have money to do). \n\n\n*\n\n*I could find a way to install macOS Sierra (preferred).\nI've looked into the MacOS Sierra patcher program, but this computer isn't supported.\nI'm absolutely willing to try a hardware upgrade. What do you guys think about this post on iFixit? It uses the same EMC as my Mac.\n\n*I could find a way to upgrade to a newer version of Xcode (9 or later)\nThis solves the current problem, but not others that I've encountered as well.\nHere is the EveryMac page for my Mac. Any help with either of these would be great.\n\nA: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 is the last supported release of macOS for your model of iMac. The latest release of Xcode that can be installed on your machine is Xcode 8.2.1 with macOS 10.12.2 SDK and iOS 10.2 SDK.\nIt is not officially possible to install macOS Sierra or use Xcode 9 (or later) on your iMac.\n\nA: So, for anyone else looking at this, the answer is yes, it is possible to run macOS Sierra on a 2007 iMac. After reading the iFixit post linked in the question, I was able to do a hardware upgrade. I had to replace the CPU and the Wireless Airport card. From there, I used the patcher tool (http://dosdude1.com/software.html) to install and boot macOS High Sierra (I’m sure Sierra would work as well, but I figured High Sierra was even better).\nMojave and above had some graphics issues that make the OS more or less unusable. I tried using a project from GitHub to fix it, but it almost bricked the computer so I don’t recommend it.\nI also will say there are some issues with High Sierra randomly freezing up (and requiring a force reboot). I don’t know why this happens, and I actually think it was happening even back when I was on El Capitan.\nYou can read more about it here: https://calebcoderblog.wordpress.com/2019/01/25/the-imac/#more-58\n", "Q: Can you watch movies from an external USB flash drive on an iOS device?

Not really an answer, but here is a snippet of the AppleScript I'm using to save the opened tabs to an array fot\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set windowCount to number of windows\nend tell\n\nset fot to {}\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    repeat with x from 1 to windowCount\n        set tn to (target of window x as alias)\n        copy tn to the end of the fot\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe array can then dumped to a temporary file e.g. foo, where foo follows the Applescript format of posix file paths using colons, e.g. set foo to \"full:path:to:file\", then\ntry\n    set dataStream to open for access file foo with write permission\n    set eof of dataStream to 0\n    write fot to dataStream starting at eof as list\n    close access dataStream\non error\n    try\n        close access file foo\n    end try\nend try\n\nYou can then read the file (e.g. foo) at a later time to restore the tabs,\nset foo to \"full:path:to:file\"\nset readdat to (read file fphds as list)\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to length of readdat\n    set tb to item i of readdat\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        activate\n        open tb\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nThe order of the opened tabs might be changed (I think the order is current tab followed by tabs sorted by their creation date), and to my knowledge, unlike safari, finder does not have the tab properties accessible to AppleScript (to AppleScript, tabs and windows of finder are indistinguishable). I'm using the snippet with hammerspoon (a lua scripting tool) to manually save/restore using keyboard shortcuts. Hammerspoon also has api to detect window losing focus(deactivate) so this may be potentially automated.\nIf speed is not a concern, you may try doing the whole thing in hammerspoon (no need for temp file, keeping tab orders but can take a second or two. primitive code, may break in some edge cases):\nget_finder_ctab = [[tell application \"Finder\"\n    set tn to (target of the front window as alias)\nend tell\n\nget POSIX path of tn\n]]\n\ntab_save = {}\n\nfunction h_save_finderTab()\n    fapp = hs.application.get'Finder'\n    hs.application.launchOrFocus(\"Finder\")\n    num_ftab = fapp:focusedWindow():tabCount()\n    tab_save = {}\n    for i=1, num_ftab do\n        fapp:focusedWindow():focusTab(i)\n        runokay,tab_save[i],_ = hs.osascript.applescript(get_finder_ctab)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction h_restore_finderTab()\n    for _,t in ipairs(tab_save) do\n        hs.open(t)\n    end\nend\n\nAlternative\nIf it's a one-time thing like clicking the red-cross by accident, you may also try hold down the option key then right click finder icon in dock, then choose \"Relaunch\", which can trigger Finder to read the saved state (I find sometimes it may be not up to date and may restore an old tab list)\n", "Q: Clean up Hard Drive and Re-install Mac I have the following MacBook\n\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)\n\nI want to format the hard-disk and reinstall the Mac so that I have a clean system. \nI tried to boot up with CMD + R and reinstall OS.

I can't mount it or eject it, either. \nIn Terminal, diskutil list can see it, but mounting with mount got a time out, so did eject.\nIt works fine on Windows OS through BootCamp. I even did a disk scan using Windows utility, trying to fix whatever that may have failed macOS, but nothing improved from that. All my other USB drives work fine on both OSes. So it must be something between the specific drive and macOS.\n\nA: I found the solution in another post:\nExternal Hard Drive Won't Mount\nps aux | grep fsck to find the PID where fsck locks the drive.\nThen\nsudo kill -9 <PID> to kill fsck.\nAfter that, my drive mounted normally.\n", "Q: Why aren't my profile and bashrc files hidden?

And does it\n  actually matter?\n\nYes to both questions.\nBasically .bashrc ≠ bashrc \n(same hold true for the other files mentioned as well)\nA Unix dot-file (.filename) is treated as a hidden file.  The dot preceding the filename is actually part of the filename itself; it's just interpreted by the system to be hidden.\nTo look at it another way, it's as if you used any other character at the beginning of the filename (a dash for example).  -filename is a very different file from filename.\nSo, when you say you've edited your profile, your actually editing the wrong file, you need to edit your .profile.\nThere's an excellent post on StackOverflow that explains when to use .bashrc and  .bash_profile \n\nSo shouldn't there be an error from the terminal/bash initialisation\n  program that's looking for .profile and .bashrc, since I only have\n  profile and bashrc?\n\nYou're not getting an error message because there's no error\n\n\n*\n\n*these files are optional\n\n*.profile and .bashrc don't exist (see above)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*There are no mandatory startup files, bash will happily start up without .bashrc or .profile\n\n*bash doesn't read your profile or bashrc files at all.\n\n\nFrom man bash:\nFILES\n   /bin/bash\n          The bash executable\n   /etc/profile\n          The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells\n   ~/.bash_profile\n          The personal initialization file, executed for login shells\n   ~/.bashrc\n          The individual per-interactive-shell startup file\n   ~/.bash_logout\n          The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits\n   ~/.inputrc\n          Individual readline initialization file\n\nOnly the executable is really needed (for obvious reasons), all the others are optional, and bash doesn't care about other files with similar names.

Back in the 80s the yen character occupied the same codepoint as the yen ¥ symbol so you'd just type that instead.

I've reported the issue but of course it could take them a while to fix it. As a short term solution they suggested recording a macro in the app that inserts a backslash and assigning it to the yen key which worked for editing text. Unfortunately it doesn't work for various dialogs in the app like the search and replace form where I type regular expressions and need to enter backslash often.\nIn the meantime I wondering is there some other creative solution I can do at an OS level?\n\nA: You could make a custom keyboard that uses another key for backslash, with\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/ukelele\n", "Q: Using Command + [number] to go between terminals Before I upgraded to Mojave I was able to use command + [number] to go between various windows in Terminal.

In the end I want to add around 400 GB's of data to my main partition (BIGtb).  I first tried converting all the partitions to APFS in hopes that I could do a simple merge, which failed.  I then converted the two partitions back to OSX Journaled. \nI will post pics that I believe may be informative.\n\n\n\n\nA: While the volumes stored in a APFS container are random access, the container itself is not. An APFS container is stored in a GPT partition. These types are partitions are sequentially stored on a drive. It is possible to expand a GPT partition to occupy space immediately before or after the partition. However, an APFS container can only be expanded to occur space immediately after, but not before. So you have two problems. First the ~400 GB of space is not immediately adjacent to the partition holding the APFS container. The partition with identifier disk0s3 is between this space and the partition holding the APFS container. Second, the space is above the APFS container. So even if you were to remove disk0s3, you still could not add the space to the APFS container.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*While the drive and APFS allow random access, the GPT scheme does not.\n\n*APFS can be only be expanded downwards or shrunk upwards.\n\n\nIf you wish to wipe the entire drive and create 1.4 TB APFS container followed by JHFS+ partition, then enter the following command.\ndiskutil partitiondisk disk0 2 gpt apfs MyAPFS 1400G jhfs+ MyJHFS+ R\n\nThe EFI partition will be created automatically.

If so why does it acess the DATA hdd without problems? I tried to install fuse but don't know what to do after installing it \nIs it a shared the HDD problem? Should I share the inside folders instead? \nTo mention the Production folder is a 3tb folder ntfs gpt \n\nA: Accessing Window's shares on macOS is actually pretty simple but you must follow a couple of Windows login rules.\n\n*\n\n*Set a username and password for the account you want to access the drive on that Windows server and give it the appropriate permissions on that server. It sounds like it should be in the Administrators group, but your choice.\n\n*When you connect to the PC from your Mac and it asks for a username and password you must \"Fully Qualify\" the username like this: [DOMAIN] \\ [USERNAME]\n\nI am assuming here that you are using an AD Domain account to access the Windows server which is Microsoft best practices for a Windows DC. For example.\nSay I have a server in an AD (Active Directory) Domain and the domain is called \"Americas.\" I would create the user I want in the Americas domain and give that account the appropriate permissions on the server in question. If we assume my AD username is \"stevec\" and my password is \"123456\" then I would log onto that server like this:\n\nUsername: americas\\stevec\nPassword: 123456\n\nFor completeness sake if you need to access a server (or really any Windows PC) that is not in a domain you preface your username with the name (formerly called the NETBIOS name) of the PC on the network, a backslash, and then your username on that PC.\n", "Q: Prevent Mail.app from opening in split view After installing macOS Mojave, Mail.app always opens in split view when I am in a fullscreen space. Two examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am in fullscreen Safari and click a mailto link: an email composition window opens in split view.\n\n*I am in any other fullscreen space and I click a notification of a new mail: the mail opens in split view.\n\n\nIs there any way of preventing that from happening and instead opening Mail.app in a normal window?\n\nA: Go to Mail -> Prefrences:\n\nThen click on general and untick this box:\n\nAfter unticking the box mail should return to its previous behaviour.\n\nA: The only workaround I know of is to minimize the mail window.  The issue appears to happen when Mail determines there is a problem getting mail from an account which happens often (for some reason) if you've got a lot of mail accounts.  If mail detects an issue, it pulls Mail to the front and if you're in full screen it puts it in split view when the system can get mail again.\nIf Mail is minimized to the dock it appears to not do this.\nI have yet to find a way to disable split screen across the board (I would like to, as I never use it).\n", "Q: How can I rotate a slo-mo video? I have a slow motion video I took on an iPhone using the \"SLO-MO\" setting. Unfortunately it recorded in portrait mode, and I want it in landscape. I want to rotate it, but I don't want to lose the ability to change what part of it plays in slow motion.\nI tried exporting the original file and rotating it with Quicktime (on a Mac). It worked, but when I import it back to Photos (with or without the original .xmp metadata file) it shows up as a plain video file that's slow all the way through.\nI tried opening it in iMovie (on an iPhone) and rotating it. It worked, but I can only output it as a fixed-speed video.\nThere's got to be a way to rotate a slo-mo video without turning it into a regular video, right?\n\nA: Hey it turns out if you're using Mojave you can use Quick Look to rotate a video right in the Finder, then import back to Photos and still have Slo-Mo!\nSelect your video in Photos and from the menu bar choose:\nFile > Export > Export Unmodified Original For 1 Video...\nMake sure \"Export IPTC as XMP\" is checked. Save your video to a folder. There will be two files, one for the video and one .xmp for the metadata.\nIn the finder, select the video file and hit space to bring up a Quick Look window. At the middle right of the title bar there should be a little button with a rectangle and a curved arrow for \"rotate counter-clockwise\". Click it, or option-click for clockwise.\nThe video will rotate. If it's large, it may show an \"exporting\" notice and take a moment. When it's done, use Quick Look again to verify that it has rotated. It'll play without any slo-mo, but that's alright.\nGrab the folder containing both the video and the .xmp and drag it back into Photos. Photos will import the rotated video and give it all the right metadata, including slo-mo! Now you can delete the original un-rotated version.\nI don't know why this works using Quick Look to rotate but not Quicktime Player. I don't know why they didn't just build rotating videos right into Photos. But at least it works!\n", "Q: Safari showing website in different language than what's set in Preferences Surfing around found a web site I needed info. from. It's in Japanese Language.  Whats w/ that? Safari is browser, an it's set with English as language, in Region Setting preferences. \nIs there no changing the Web page language and shouldn't all language on this Mac be in English if Regional options have been set U.S.A.? \n\nA: Regional Settings in Preferences sets your \"localization\" preferences.  In other words, it sets the language, the decimal notation, the date format, etc. for your local computer.\nIt does not force remote computers to conform to the standard you selected.\nWhether or not a website displays in your preferred language has to do with the website/web developer and whether or not they chose to implement a translation mechanism or alternate websites based on country of the visitor (this is usually done by a combination of location and browser agent string).\nIf the website you visit doesn't provide either an English version or an automatic translation feature, there are online translators available.  I prefer to use Bing Translator\n", "Q: Sub-window hidden behind another window... any way to retrieve other than minimizing? My one grievance with how MacOS handles window management is that sometimes windows get hidden behind others and do not appear in the dock as they are not minimized. The only way to find these windows again is to minimize the windows in front of them. Is there a quick way to see all windows like in Microsoft Windows, where every window gets a spot in the dock? \nFor example, you are using the Mail app. You start writing an email. You start doing work in other windows without minimizing the message draft window. Lets say you open up 3 or 4 other windows. The only way to find that message draft window is to minimize those 3 or 4 windows. Is there a way to make the message window always appear in the dock so you can retrieve it from there?\n\nA: In current versions of macOS (the last few, in fact) allow you to tap the F3 key to show all windows of the current application. On MacBook built-in keyboards and Apple's own keyboards the F3 key has an odd looking icon that represents this. Similar to the F4 grid of squares that brings up Launch Pad.\nWindows will shrink in size so they can appear all together on screen allowing you to tap on the window you want to restore the App with that window frontmost.\n", "Q: My WD drive is not showing in finder but I can see it in disk utility with a grey color I can't see my external Hard Drive in finder but i can see my hard drive in disk utility but in a grey almost transparent color.

Reading, possibly out of date info, elsewhere OS X seems to limit the maximum process size according to the total RAM and a fixed proportion of the available disk. \nThe new 2018 Mac Mini is very tempting, but what will the effect of limiting myself to a 128G or 256G in terms of process size?\nI'm currently use Wolfram Mathematica to do so some weighty audio simulation on a 2009 16Gigabyte 2.88Ghz 4 Core Mac Pro with OS X El Capitan installed on a 256G SSD and piles of extra SATA HD. Every so often Wolfram come to a dead stop and quits, which may be a memory issue but I'm not sure. \n\nA: macOS does not limit the maximum process size (i.e. working set) according to total RAM and a fixed proportion of available disk. This is 100% not the case in any way at all.\nYou can set arbitrary limits on process size using the \"ulimit\" command in the Terminal, those are however limits chosen by the user - and thus can be changed as need be.\nThere are ofcourse actual, \"physical\" limits of a process size given by the hardware. Contrary to common belief, it is not actually possible for an ordinary 64-bit system to have processes that address 2^64-1 bytes of RAM. On macOS (and Windows other systems) processes are actually limited to 2^48-1 bytes instead. I.e. a given pointer only has 48 bits that are actually significant.\nThere are paging techniques to counter this, but in practice no ordinary program employs them.\nIn addition to the physical limits, there are other limits you'll run into. If you have meaningful data in RAM, the system needs somewhere to store it. The total RAM installed on the system as well as the free disk space available for swapping becomes a limit.\nNote that this is not a fixed limit in any way. If your RAM contents are compressable (i.e. for example if it contains many repeated bytes), then you'll be able to have extremely large process sizes without problems. Much more than you have physical RAM and swap space.\n", "Q: How to change language of an existing Pages for iCloud document?

However for many of my repeating calendar events, I don't want the default alert, instead wanting only to be notified at the time of the event, for example.\nSo on those events, I change the default alert value to \"none\", and when prompted if I want to save for all future events, I say yes.\nIf I then edit the event, I can confirm visually that the alert has been changed.  I can quit Calendar, re-open it, and again confirm that the former default alert is now set to \"none\".\nBut then if the event is more than a couple of hours away (like the next day for instance), the default alert will be back.  For all future events.\nI do use iCloud calendars between my iMac (macOS Sierra), Macbook (High Sierra), and iPhone (iOS 11.3), and it doesn't matter which device I make the change on, it will always revert.\nThis is seriously annoying, does anyone know why this happens and how to fix it?\n\nA: UPDATE:  Cancel all of this.  I just realized today that all my default 1-hour alerts are again back on my desktop device calendars.  However they are NOT back on my iPhone.  iOS shows no default 1-hour alert, but macOS does on both laptop and desktop (High Sierra and Sierra, respectively).\nSo I don't know if this is a bug in macOS Calendar or iCloud or what, but it's still driving me nuts.  Original \"answer\" follows.\nAt the moment it appears I have finally solved this.  Apparently I must not have tried changing all the alerts from my phone after all though I thought I had.  Changing them from macOS simply did not work, but changing them all one by one from the phone, seems to have done the trick.  This morning my usual alert at 9am that always would go off at 8am, did not.  It went off at 9am as desired.  So unless I find things revert back again...

It will keep polling the server periodically for 3-5 seconds when the app is active.\nAt the same time we are also using APNS service for push notification.\nThe question is: If we submit this iOS app to the App Store, will it be rejected by Apple because of using periodically polling method? Apple has suggested the right way is to use APNS for status update in background.\n\nA: No Apple won't. At-least not just for this reason.\nA simple answer is, your app could execute any code as long as it is active. Your app won't be rejected by Apple simply for the reason that it is making periodic calls to your backend. However, where it's a good approach to take or not is another question altogether and an important one to consider.\nA general recommendation from Apple for app developers is to minimize the network activity to prolong the battery life and to guard against any data costs on a metered connection.\nFrom the Networking Overview guide on Apple Developer website:\n\nTransfer only as much data as required to accomplish a task. Minimizing the amount of data sent and received prolongs battery life, and may reduce the cost for users on metered Internet connections that bill by the megabyte.\n\nAPNS is preferred over polling as when using APNS, your app gets notified about the updates on an as needed basis. Another benefit is that polling will only work when your app is active and in foreground.\nSo, it is recommended to reconsider your app architecture to take the most appropriate approach keeping in mind best practises, Apple Developer guidelines and overall user experience.\n", "Q: My friend installed something called Jamf on my MacBook I have a MacBook Air 7,2. My friend installed something called Jamf on it. Now I can't access most of my applications. My son said he couldn't force quit it so I'm thinking it must be some kind of virus.\nThe IT man managed to get it up on Activity Monitor, but when he tried to force quit it, it just reopened and when he tried to uninstall it with terminal it just blocked terminal.\n\nAny help that could be offered would be appreciated because otherwise, I may need to just throw out the MacBook and buy a new one.\n\nA: The instructions to remove the framework just require you to have a local admin password.\n/usr/local/bin/jamf removeFramework\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/153/removing-jamf-components-from-computers\nThis will remove all the things that the tool installed (apps, profiles, certificates) and then remove the management framework. You do not want to do this if you have FileVault keys not in your direct control or don't have a good backup or you are trying to circumvent a proper installation. \nSince this can break things, you might check with the team that runs JAMF for the organization your friend belongs. Removing the framework doesn't have to break anything if the IT department put light controls in place. \nChecking with their team means they can also remotely run the uninstall or tell you the things this will delete, but you certainly don't need to throw away the hardware (or throw it here - I know several people that would use it happily).\n\nA: The tool is every bit as @Nimesh said. I would like to add some extra tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't throw away your laptop. Instead backup your documents, photos and other important data. Erase your laptop and clean reinstall it;\n\n*Don't give your account password to anyone. If they need it to perform some special task, enter it yourself;\n\n*Create Guest Accounts for such occasions.\n\nA: Nimesh and Alexander answered the question about Jamf Now.\n\nThre are 2 possibilities to get rid of it.\nFirst of all: Ask your friend why they did that with your device and ask them to remove it from jamf Now management.\nIn Order to do that you must follow few simple steps: \n1. Log Into Jamf\n2. Select Yout Device\n3. Click on three dots on the right upper corner\n4. Click unenroll your device.\nThis will remove all Jamf now Setting and your device won't be controlled over this MDM anymore. \n\nSecond option works ONLY IF your device was not pre-enrolled using DEP. (in that case you must ask your friend or someone at their company to remove that serial number from Apple's DEP portal since that will drive re-enrollment into MDM). If either not the case, back up your Mac data so you can restore to the \"before Jamf\" state.\n\nYou can also try new clean installation of your Mac once you have a backup. You will then know if it's enrolled through DEP or if this was a simple MDM enrollment that was optional and not forced via Apple.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Jamf is a device management/mobile device management solution. It enables remote control and management of the configured device.\nDue to the nature of the software, it can restrict users of the machine (even the admin users) from performing certain administrative operations (depending on the applied configuration). It is thus obvious that the end-users cannot uninstall and/or quit the Jamf app.\nJamf is one of the well-known among many remote/mobile device management solutions, generally used in enterprise/school environment to centrally manage a large number of mobile devices (laptops/tablets/phones). Jamf is absolutely not a virus, nor is it a ransomware.\nYou can learn more about Jamf product offerings here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/products/\nThere is absolutely no reason to throw away your MacBook. I'd advise you to get in touch with your friend and ask him for the reason why it was installed in first place. You can also ask to remove it, if it was installed in accident, or just out of curiosity.\nA mobile device management solution is generally not required for personal devices.\n", "Q: Reseting iPhone 6s with iTunes My iPhone 6s is disabled. If I reset it with iTunes will I lose service with my carrier?\nI already know how to erase my information off the iPhone with iTunes, but I'm wondering if I do it, will I lose my service with Boost Mobile?\n\nA: You won't lost service with your cellular service provider simply by erasing your iPhone.\nHowever, you iPhone will need re-activation once it is setup again after erasing. Activation process is generally happens automatically.\nThe iPhone can be erased with or without using iTunes.\n\nA: TL;DR: Your carrier service is perfectly safe, but you need to know how to enable your phone after erasing it.\nErasing iPhone wouldn't have any impact on your carrier service. As the name suggests, it only erases your data that contained on your iPhone.\nHowever, you mentioned your iPhone is disabled. This one could be a bit tricky. The main question is: Was it locked with an iCloud account?\nIf YES (which would be true for most iPhones nowadays), you need the iCloud account/password to activate the phone after erasing it.\nif NO, then maybe you would be lucky enough to just erasing it and start over clean (losing all previous data of course).\n", "Q: Cannot access directory through standard user even when permission is given I have a directory that I need to use to launch my OpenVPN client in my Mac.

I can't get this information with right click on the favorite, it is not listed in the Finder preferences and the information is not present in the plist file.\nWhere can I get this information?\n\nA: If you want to find the original location of an unmounted folder you've added to the Favorites Sidebar, just select the item and press CommandI for Get Info.  Alternatively, you can right click it and select the menu item.\nThe location will be identified in the \"Where\" field.\nIn the picture below, I took a random folder (this one named \"Music Archive\") and attached it to my Favorites in the Sidebar.

I looking to  have the same ability available on my iPhone.\nPlease note, I'm not looking to subscribe to Apple Music. I am exploring if:\n\n\n*\n\n*The same feature from iTunes desktop app is available in iOS/1st party apps.\n\n*3rd party apps which can let me listen to the streaming Internet Radio stations that are available under iTunes for desktop.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible but requires a bit of copy/paste work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the radio stream in iTunes on desktop.\n\n*Select the Edit menu, choose the Song Info entry (or just press Command + I). This will show you the location URL of the stream.  For example, the first stream in the 80s Flashback section is A_A 80s with the URL of http://listen.shoutcast.com/a-a80svs90s.\n\n*Click the URL and it will select all of the text.\n\n*Copy the URL to the clipboard (Command + C)\n\n*If you have your desktop setup to use Handoff to your iPhone, open the Web browser on the phone (Safari and Chrome both work) and paste in the URL.

Using the activity monitor, I can observe that mDNSResponder has sent, after a while, 595 KB and received 313.8 MB.\nSome details about my network topology: I connect with WiFi to an Android phone and a Windows 8 computer was on the same local network.  I’d like to know if an any situation this would use tethering data which can be costly in some countries per MB sent/received.\nI know that mDNSResponder is a legitimate macOS process. \nMy question is how can I limit the traffic generated by mDNSResponder in order to avoid it running up a data bill.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Despite its name, mDNSResponder handles both local multicast DNS (\"mDNS\", which will not be adding to your cell bill), and regular unicast DNS (which is not generally local, and will be adding to your cell bill). The figures in Activity Monitor don't distinguish between the two. My guess is that most of the traffic is local (mDNS is a bit chatty), but you'd have to run some tests to be sure.\nThere is a way to cut down on actual DNS traffic: a lot of the DNS lookups your computer is doing are probably from web ads, and some forms of ad blocking will prevent those lookups. Unfortunately, I haven't looked at this in a while, and don't know which types of blockers work early enough to prevent the DNS lookup. Essentially, there are three levels at which a blocker can work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detect and block ad content very early, and block fetching the ad content before the DNS lookup is done (leading to minimal network traffic).\n\n*Detect and block ad content after the lookup is done, but before the ad content is fetched (leading to slightly more network traffic).\n\n*Detect and block ad content after it is fetched (leading to full network traffic, ads just aren't displayed).\n\n\nOne ad-blocking method that's guaranteed to work at the first level is installing an alternate /etc/hosts file with faked entries for known advertising server domains. There are a variety of these available, for instance at Steven Black's github (which has a bunch of them with different groups of servers, also has scripts for building your own). If you want to do this, there are installation instructions here, although I'll add one step: make a backup copy of the original /etc/hosts file first!\n\nA: On MacOS there is a way to greatly reduce mDNSResponder's traffic on the local network.\nFrom the manpage for mDNSResponder:\nOPTIONAL ARGUMENTS\n mDNSResponder accepts the following optional arguments:\n\n -AlwaysAppendSearchDomains\n                            Append search domains for multi-labeled Partially Qualified Domain Name as well as single-labeled Partially\n                            Qualified Domain Name.  This argument is not recommended because of the extra DNS traffic it generates and\n                            its adverse effect on battery life.\n\n -NoMulticastAdvertisements\n                            Prevent the system from advertising Bonjour services via Multicast DNS.\n\n To cause mDNSResponder to run with these optional arguments when it launches on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later, set the\n AlwaysAppendSearchDomains or NoMulticastAdvertisements boolean keys to true in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist and\n reboot.\n\nThe second option will stop mDNS from broadcasting bonjour availability, although I don't think it's Bonjour traffic that is your problem, that traffic won't leave the network. I believe you can use a configuration profile to duplicate this on iOS.\nBecause of recent security news, most of it bad, you might want to take some time to make sure that some apps are not ferrying screenshots of your screen, or, in my case, slyly pumping out half a gig in the dead of the night.\nI found turning off bluetooth at night stopped this.  \n\nA: Looking at the traffic from a node on your local network (your Mac) to your router (your Android phone in tethering) is not going to give you an accurate picture of what network traffic is going out to and in from  the Internet.   Just because your Mac generates network packets doesn't mean that the router/gateway forwards them on.  To accurately see what's being sent, you need to look at the traffic at the router/gateway.\nHowever, for the purposes of this question, this is a moot point as all the traffic is local.\n\nMy question is how to limit the traffic generated by mDNSResponder in\n  order to avoid spending money unnecessarily....I was connected with\n  WiFi to an Android phone and a Windows 8 computer was on the same\n  local network.\n\nHow do we know that the traffic from mDNSResponder is local only?\nWe know it's the process that handles the local zero config protocol also known as Bonjour.  The traffic that you are seeing is between your Mac, the Windows 8 machine and the WiFi side of your Android phone.\n", "Q: Missed calls appearing on two different phones One of my phones is an iPhone SE and another an iPhone 5S.\nWhen you go to phone.app -> Recents the same calls appear on both devices.\nThey are both on the same Apple ID so this is probably why.\nIn iCloud Settings I found no option to disable this.\nHow can this be stopped without changing Apple ID's on one device?\n\nA: The problem is caused by sharing the same Apple ID on both devices.\nAccording to this, this, and this sites, you can either\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a separate Apple ID for one of the phones, or\n\n*Turn off Settings -> (Your Apple ID) -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive:\n\n\n\n", "Q: Does “Prevent computer from sleeping…” remain in effect even if I close the lid?

Does this setting also prevent the laptop from going to sleep even then?\n\nA: No, it does not. The MacBook goes into a low power sleep mode, unless you have an external monitor connected.\n\nA: Closing the lid will put the system to sleep, no matter what settings you employ.  This is considered the equivalent of selecting “Sleep” from the Apple menu.  The only way the laptop will stay awake after closing the lid, is if you have an external monitor attached to it and the laptop is being powered by its wall plug (i.e. it is not running off its battery). In which case, it is considered to be in “clamshell” mode and the computer will stay awake and output its video to the external monitor.

I have my eyes on the Sennheiser MKE-2, linked here:\nhttps://en-us.sennheiser.com/clip-on-lavalier-microphone-live-speech-instrument-mke-2\nHowever, I know nothing about compatibility between the Sennheiser MKE-2 and MacBook Pro. I have a 2015 15\" MacBook Pro, and I was wondering the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is the MKE-2 MacBook Compatible\n\n*Is there a general adapter solution to external microphone compatibility issues on MacBooks? \n\n\nThank you. \n\nA: A lav mic like the one you linked to is so detached from your Mac that it really doesn't make sense to consider the compatibility between the two devices...\nIn a way, yes, all microphones can be made to work with your Mac, but if you were wondering if you could use one of the 1/8\" terminated replacement model numbers plugged directly into the headphone jack, the answer would be a big no.\nA lav usually plugs into the body pack (power feed/radio transmitter) on the wearer, used in situations where mobility is important (theatre, broadcasting, stage, etc.)\nIn a typical use case, you have lav → pack ⤏ (RF signal) ⤏ receiver → mixer → then the output. It usually comes part of a system comprising at least the first three components in that chain.\nBetween the mic and your MBP, there would have to be (at the minimum) an audio interface providing 48V phantom power. If you already have a system capable of powering a condenser mic, conceivably you might be able to order it XLR-terminated, but I don't know if Sennheiser would fill such an order.\nActually, your question made me curious and I googled around a bit, and to my surprise, did find this lav mic that looks like it would work directly plugged into the headphone jack on a MBP. It's definitely an oddball, but looks cool, apparently they use some MEMS device to make a proper condenser mic work with the limited current available from the TRRS jacks on iPhones and Macs. Maybe it would fit your requirements better. \n\nA: I fully agree with all user3052786 has said regarding the usual connectivity setup via a powered body-pack & eventually running through a USB audio interface. This is your optimum setup for mobility.\nNow, I don't actually know the Sennheiser system at all [I've used the mics, but never actually been part of the rigging/setup crew] & working through their web page I'm not seeing exactly how they terminate their mics, nor how simple it would be to use one of these wired straight into a 48v USB interface.\nWhat I am familiar with is the DPA [Danish Pro Audio, part of Brüel & Kjær] system. Their lav mics come with a proprietary 'micro-dot' termination system designed to plug directly into their own interfaces... the upside, however, is they make adaptors for just about any system you can imagine, including on to a regular XLR. This would allow you, if you needed, to plug the mic directly into your USB interface & save on the entire radio side of things.\nIf your presentations are seated, or 'low movement' that could be a good place to look.\nThe particular mic I'm thinking of is one of their 4060 range - in all colours, sizes, different SPL levels; EQ control is similar to the Sennheiser system by changing mic covers [& I'm pretty sure it was B&K who invented that system]\nThe DPAs used to be considerably more expensive, but I see their pricing is now very similar to the Sennheiser. \nSee the range of 4060 & accessories at DPA - d:screet™\n4060 Series Miniature Omnidirectional Microphone\nI have no affiliation, just a happy user.\n", "Q: How to remove a large number of unused keywords from Apple Photos app? My Photo library has evolved over many years, starting out as an iPhoto library, then being merged with an Aperture library, then becoming a Photos library.  Over the course of the last 20 or so years I've accumulated thousands of keywords that have zero photos associated with them.\nThe Photos app itself does not support a 'Delete unused keywords' feature, and I have looked at using AppleScript to do this, but, despite being quite an experienced programmer, I could not work out how to do this (AppleScript drives me nuts quite honestly).\nI'm hoping someone has already written such a script, or if not a script then some other utility that will do this for me.\n\nA: Below is a script I wrote and tested over quite a few days.  Whilst Apple's Photos.app is scriptable, you've already observed that it lacks the necessary methods to delete unused keywords.  If you are familiar with AppleScript and the notion of UI scripting, this appears to be the only option available.\nNote: For UI scripting to work, you need to provide the necessary accessibility privileges to Script Editor.\nMy personal view towards UI scripting is generally a negative one, but I have taken extra care to try and mitigate the typical temperamental nature and fragility of UI scripts, and done a few tests on my system to observe a reasonably smooth operation.\nHowever, the one specific feature I couldn't (wasn't willing to) check during testing is how the script performs when there are thousands of keywords, and/or an extremely large Photos library.  I myself have a Photos library consisting of fewer than 100 photos, and none of them had been tagged with keywords, so I created a sample of 20, of which I randomly assigned about half of them.\nIn theory, the only affect library volume or keyword count should have on script operation is the length of time it takes to execute.  But, with AppleScript, there may be timeout issues that prematurely abort the script; and with UI scripting, the probability of it throwing an error tends to increase with running time.\nSpecific notes regarding these uncertainties on performance are expanded upon below the script.  If you run into any issues, please report back and I shall consider how to implement a fix.

In order to do this, every single photo in your library needs to be enumerated (retrieved), and its keywords property evaluated.  This happens virtually immediately at the start of the script; and again after purging keywords to determine if the purge was complete.  It's a time-consuming process, and therefore a potential timeout threat for the script.\nOne ought to be able to extend the default timeout value like so:\n    with timeout of 600 seconds\n        set activeKeywords to the list of currentKeywords()\n    end timeout\nor it may be necessary to slightly alter the syntax in retrieving the photos so that the script directly targets the Photos app at the point of enumeration, instead of by way of property references; and then to enclose the Photos command within a timeout block.  But, for now, I've left it to see if the script will run on your system using the default timeout, which might not be a constraint if the enumeration takes place synchronously (and I don't know whether or not it does).\n\n*Regarding UI scripting potential roadblocks: the Photos AppleScript dictionary doesn't provide a way to retrieve all keywords that exist in the app.  The way the script works around this is to open up the Keyword Manager and read off the name of every keyword label that it detects under the section \"Keywords\".  What I don't know is whether every UI element containing a keyword label is loaded when the Keyword Manager window gets created; or whether they get loaded piecewise when a user scrolls through the list.  The latter situation would be irksome, as it would result in an incomplete list of keywords and then an incomplete purge.\nOne obvious solution would be to run the script multiple times to perform multiple purges until the are no remaining purgeable items.\n\n*When considering the worst-case scenario, analysing the script appears to have one of three possible outcomes (regardless of how the script terminates, be it through completion of its run or by throwing an error):\n\n\n*\n\n*Either the script does nothing (nil result);\n\n*OR an incomplete purge occurs (partial success);\n\n*OR a complete purge occurs (success).\nThere does not seem to be a way for the script to fail in a way that negatively impacts the Photos library, so the worst-case scenario appears to be the nil result.  However, if we assume I can be wrong, you may want to put a margin on error on the potential worse-case scenario.\nThis margin is up to you and your judgment, which is tough to make when you perhaps don't know what types of things I'm typically wrong about.  If it helps, I would say label it impossible for the script to delete any of your photos, because it does not perform any filesystem operations.  If impossible is not good enough, then the clear precaution to take is to backup your entire Photos library beforehand.  Depending on the size of your library, this may range from simple to pain-staking for the sake of a near zero-chance event.\nWhat the script does do (obviously) is read and edit lists of keywords.  So, while it ought not to be possible, it wouldn't be foolish to consider that all of your keywords for all of your photos might just disappear.  Should you want to cover yourself for this unlikely event, then I provide this \"scriptlet\" that you can run beforehand in order to back up your keywords:\nproperty path : \"~/Desktop/Photos.Keywords.Backup.plist\"\n\n\nbackupKeywordsToFile at path\n--!

If it's possible, could you show a brief instruction on how it could be done?\n\nA: \nWill App Store allow me to upload a paid app but still give me the right to give away free licences to people I choose?\n\nYes, you can generate and distribute promo codes for your apps to your existing customers. Apps bought with promo codes work similar to apps bought normally and are linked to the customers Apple ID.\nHowever, there's an upper cap on the total number of promo codes that can be generated in a given time duration. This approach will be useful only if the total number of such customers is under the set limit.\nFrom the App Store Connect Resources and Help - FAQ:\n\nHow do I offer promo codes?\nPromo codes allow you to offer a free copy of your app or in-app purchase for promotional purposes and are valid for 28 days from the day they are generated or until your agreement expires, whichever comes first. You can request up to 100 total promo codes for each platform version or 100 promo codes for each in-app purchase item, with a limit of 1,000 total in-app purchase codes per app every six months (resetting on January 1 and July 1).

Want to buy an external monitor for a mid-2013 MacBook Air. Am wondering whether one with a Thunderbolt 2 port will be better in that it will also power the laptop. Else I'll buy one with USB-C to power the next laptop I buy, and use a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 cable/adapter for now.\nCan a monitor connected with Thunderbolt 2 power a mid-2013 MacBook Air?\n\nA: Essentially, no. While Thunderbolt 1 & 2 can power downstream devices, the maximum amount of power is not that much, and there does not appear to be any provision for powering upstream devices including the host computer. Macs can certainly not be powered/charged via a Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port. Thunderbolt 2-to-3 adapters do not change this and do not retroactively enable more power delivery on the Thunderbolt 2 side.\nThe Apple Thunderbolt display actually had a MagSafe connector in addition to its Thunderbolt cable in order to power a connected MacBook.\n\nElse I'll buy one with USB-C to power the next laptop I buy, and use a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 cable/adapter for now.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, your plan is to buy a display with USB-C as the display signal input and power delivery, and connect it to the Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port on a Macbook?\nThis won't work. There are reports that you can do this with Thunderbolt 3 based displays (e.g. LG Ultrafine 5K but note your MacBook Air does not support 5K), but it most definitely will not work with a display that simply uses USB-C with its DisplayPort alternate mode. It's not clear exactly which adapter you were planning to use but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple USB-C to (Mini) DisplayPort cables can only be run in one direction: USB-C on the host (computer) to a DisplayPort on the display.\n\n*Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters such as Apple's only work for transmitting Thunderbolt signals, not USB or USB-C's DisplayPort alternate mode.\n\n\nIf you want to buy a display that will power a future USB-C based laptop, choose a model where the USB-C port/cable with power delivery is merely one of multiple ports. You can then use either an HDMI or DisplayPort input on the display to connect to your current MacBook Air.\nNote that the 2013 MacBook Air only supports DisplayPort 1.1 and HDMI 1.2, which limits the maximum resolution and refresh rate:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort 1.1 supports up to 2560x1600 at 60Hz; depending on the specific Intel GPU and driver you may be able to drive a 4K display at 30Hz. (From personal experience, the early 2013 MacBook Pro and the 2012 Mac Mini have trouble with this; during boot and in macOS 10.12 and earlier, there is image corruption. Once booted up, 10.13 and newer seem to work ok at 4K @ 30Hz. The 2013 Air has a slightly newer CPU/GPU, so I'm not sure how it behaves.)\n\n*HDMI 1.2 (via Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable on a MacBook Air) only supports up to 1920x1200 at 60Hz.\n\n", "Q: Showing \"Return Completed\" as status but didn't receive refund yet I have ordered an IPhone and the phone was not delivered(not sure about the reason) and was returned back to apple warehouse.

My question is, how do i restore the system fonts to get my fonts back into human readable form? See the screenshots below.\n\n\n\nA: I’ll assume you have already tried a safe boot to rebuild the font cache and you legitimately have a system level corruption where the font database cannot retrieve even a system font.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to internet recovery if you can and verify that Disk Utility gives the boot volume a clean bill of health. A failing storage device would explain why a good backup on a good system would end up with corrupt fonts.\n\n*Boot to internet recovery (or local recovery) and connect to the internet and download a fresh copy of macOS to reinstall over the top of the data.\n\n\nOnce that’s done, you can be sure you have a good install and then go back to isolating how the user account got corrupted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to single user mode (or recovery) and mount the files stem as read/write and remove /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file so you can make a brand new admin account.\n\n\nIf this new admin account is also corrupt, you’ll need to perform a full erase install and/or seek hardware service since known good OS can’t be installed on an erased drive.\nIf this new admin account is fine with fonts, now you know the user account you migrated has the issue so you would decide to pick apart the font database / library for that user and re-enable all fonts in FontBook app - remove any third party font management tools. Or you could hand migrate that user’s files to a clean working account and walk away from the user corruption.\nSorry for so many if / then / else, but this isn’t a simple - press this one button to restore the fonts when you’re migrating user data to a system that’s not sure it’s working.\n", "Q: Internet recovery broken on Macbook Pro.

I have tried recovering from multiple locations using different wifi's as well as completely open firewall settings on my home router. My question is, what is causing this, how do i debug it, and how do I fix it? \nThanks!\n\n\n\nA: That indicates your machine can’t reach the internet.\nTroubleshooting this will be challenging unless you have network / wire shark capabilities and can make sure the packets from this machine are going unhindered to Apple’s servers.\nIn practice, this is far easier to diagnose by using a second Mac on this network to see if it can boot to recovery. If not - you know it’s the network. If the second can boot - you have a hardware failure or network card failure on the problem Mac.\nTaking the suspect Mac to another network that is known to be good (or just taking it to 4 or 5 networks and assuming one of them has to be OK) can also help you isolate if the problem is the network or the hardware.\nLastly, setting up a caching server on your local network would let you see those logs and be sure the Mac in question was requesting the correct recovery image from the internet. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/manage-content-caching-on-mac-mchl3b6c3720/mac\nContent caching is a super power move, since you only download one copy of each asset, then your local network accelerates all further installs and boots. \n", "Q: Remove slow motion from video in MacOS I have some videos I made on my iPhone and copied to my computer.

I have restarted the iPad and then AirDrop works for a few minutes and then I have the same issue.  I have also reset the network settings.  Same issue.  Air drop is on, and then it goes off.  \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Reset the iOS device: Hold down the On/Off button and the Home button at the same time for at\nleast ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.\nMake sure WiFi and Bluetooth are turned on. Those are required to use AirDrop and won’t work without them. The try again to turn AirDrop on, if the issue persists you should contact Apppe Support.\n", "Q: Close other user’s app Is there a Terminal command or script that will close an app running under another user?  I’d rather close than kill, but if not possible, kill would work, too.\n\nA: You cannot control processes you do not own as a non-admin user. If you can run the command as an admin, you can send the quit signal using the killall command for all existing instances of the program and quit the program that way. If you only wish to quit specific program instances you will need a more complex combination of commands. \nGranting selective admin rights to non-admin  users is possible, but keep in mind that granting process killing rights is universal and the semi-admin user will be able to kill any process. Shell scripting, AppleScript and Automator all derive their access from the same user privileges controls, so using a different tool won’t grant this right in a different way.\n\nA: You guess the needed command!\n# list all running process.  It's an old command hence the dash. \n#find needed process id.\nps aux\n\n# you need super user powers to effect other users.

I suspected there was a problem with the hard drive cable, so I took it in to a (non-Apple) repair shop to get a repair quote. \nIt turns out there was a problem with the cable, but they also said there was a problem with the hard drive. They said their tests revealed a “cyclic redundancy check” or CRC error which would necessitate total replacement of the hard drive.\nI then took the MacBook apart, removed the drive, plugged it into another Mac with a usb-adapter and ran First Aid in Disk Utility. \nNow, disk utility tells me there’s nothing wrong with the drive (big green check next to drive icon and no error messages.) I can also explore it in finder without issue. \nSo, my question is this: is it that disk utility does not recognize CRC errors where they exist, or is my hard drive actually fine and the repair shop people were wrong?\n\nA: The test in Disk Utility really only tests the file system - i.e. the high level structure of the disk’s organization into files, folders, metadata, etc. Structural errors would show up in Disk Utility.\nIf your file system is based on HFS+, there’s no CRC checksum or any other type of checksum at the file system layer.\nIf you’re running High Sierra or Mojave and have been upgraded to APFS, then there’s a checksum of the file system metadata. It’s not CRC though.\nWhat Disk Utility doesn’t really check is your actual data - i.e. file contents. As neither HFS+ nor APFS stores checksums of data, it cannot be checked.\nThis means that either the repair shop used other software to store and retrieve data on the drive, and this failed CRC checks - or they’re talking about CRC errors on the SATA bus. The latter would be expected with a bad cable - and should then be fully resolved by replacing the cable - data might have been lost, but the disk isn’t broken.\n", "Q: Using macOS without an Apple ID? I am thinking about buying myself a mac. The problem is that I don't want to use my Mac with my AppleID because I am very afraid that it will sync with my other apple devices and I'm not a big fan of this at all. I also don't want to maintain a seperate AppleID. Do I really need an AppleID for macOS and which parts of macOS I cannot use without an AppleID ?\n\nA: \nThe problem is that I don't want to use my Mac with my AppleID because I am very afraid that it will sync with my other apple devices and I'm not a big fan of this at all.\n\nYou can turn off sync and iCloud which will stop devices syncing.\n\nDo I really need an AppleID for macOS and which parts of macOS I cannot use without an AppleID\n\nAn Apple ID is heavily recommended. A lot of services will be disabled. You won’t be able to download any apps from the App Store or iTunes.\n\nThese are some of the most widely used services that you access with\n  your Apple ID:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*App Store\n  \n*Apple Music\n  \n*Apple Online Store\n  \n*Apple Retail services and programs (Concierge, Joint Venture, workshops, and youth programs)\n  \n*Apple Store app\n  \n*Apple Support Communities\n  \n*FaceTime\n  \n*Find My Friends\n  \n*Find My iPhone\n  \n*Game Center\n  \n*Books Store\n  \n*iCloud\n  \n*iMessage\n  \n*iTunes Genius\n  \n*iTunes Home Sharing\n  \n*iTunes Match\n  \n*iTunes Store\n  \n*iTunes U\n  \n*Mac App Store\n  \n*Photo Print Products\n\n\nA: No, you do not absolutely need one.\nIt is mostly used for synchronizing with your other devices, which you’ve stated that you do not want anyways.\nHowever it will still be most practical if you create a new Apple-ID to be used exclusively for that computer. If you do not, you’ll not be able to download software from the App Store.\nNote that you do not have to enter that Apple-ID in any of the systems that would otherwise sync data. Your files, photos, calendars, mails, contacts, etc. will stay completely private and not synced with anything, even if you use an Apple-ID for purchasing or otherwise downloading software from Apple.\n\nA: No you don't need one at all. I don't get what with those recommendations. Just like Windows 10, you will not able to sync to iCloud (equivalent of OneDrive), download apps from the store, sync contacts, photos and pretty much all apple services that needs an apple id.\nYou can still perform updates, sideload apps with pkg or app extension.\nThats about it. \n\nA: It would seem to me that you could setup the new Mac using an account tied to your Apple ID. You can set this account up to not sync with your other machines. You could also create another account which does not have an Apple Id. You could then choose which account to login to.\nI assume if you sign out of iCloud before logging out, the the account will not sync. You could then always log in to the account without an Apple Id. You would only log in to the account with the Apple Id when you want to use the Apps Store.\nA more drastic approach would be to actually delete the account with the Apple Id after downloading from the Apps Store.\n\nA: I have a Mac that is not associated with an Apple ID. There are a few caveats such as being unable to obtain software from The App Store and content from services listed in this answer.\nSoftware can generally be found from other sources such as vendors' websites with the exception of new operating system versions. These can be copied from another Mac that is associated with an account or they can sometimes be found on the internet from sources of varying repute.\n", "Q: Shazam with SoundCloud? Is there a way to get Shazam to listen to music in SoundCloud or MixCloud while I am listening on headphones on my iPhone?\n\nA: You go into the Shazam app and you need to long press the Shazam logo until the \"Auto-Shazam\" words appear on the top of the circle. After that when you go back to your home page it will appear a red bar on top of your apps meaning that your Shazam will be listening to whatever song is going to be played. \nEDIT: It works with headphones of course :)\n", "Q: Correcting photo number sequence I have approximately 1100 photos on file.\nAt number 1291 the numbering jumped to 3300s\nHow can I correct the number to read the next view as 1291? And so on.\nThank you\n\nA: You can change the number stored in\n~/Library/Media/PhotoData/MISC/DCIM_APPLE.plist\n\nThe integer value is stored under the key DCIMLastFileNumber.\nThis property list is accessible from a backup, so you can backup your iPhone with iTunes, modify the backup, and then restore from backup. If your device is jailbroken, you can edit the file directly on the device.\n\n\n", "Q: Manually Copy music from Windows PC to iPhone I tried using the charging/USB data cable and Windows Explorer to copy music to an iPhone, however it doesn't do anything and there are no error messages.\nI'd like to avoid using iTunes as it loves wasting time converting music files to Apple's proprietary format.\nVideos I've come across on YouTube use what seems to be shady software.\nI also turned on Bluetooth on a laptop and the iPhone and the laptop did not see the iPhone on the Windows Bluetooth program. So, how do I manually copy music from Windows to an iPhone?\n\nA: \nI tried using the charging/USB data cable and Windows Explorer to copy music to an iPhone, however it doesn't do anything and there are no error messages.\n\nThis won't work. iPhone is not mounted as a storage device in Windows Explorer.\n\nI'd like to avoid using iTunes as it loves wasting time converting music files to Apple's proprietary format.\n\nIf you don't mind using an alternate music player on your iPhone, there's an approach you can take here.\nYou'll still need to use iTunes to copy your music to iPhone, however you'll have the liberty to retain the original music file format. You can install VLC for Mobile iOS app on your iPhone. This is the same app available for Windows desktop and support similar file formats as desktop version.\nOnce you have installed the app, connect your iPhone to your Windows PC, select your iPhone and click on File Sharing in the iTunes window sidebar. Now click to select VLC under Apps. Now drag all your music files under VLC Documents pane. This will effectively copy the files into VLC app on your iPhone. The copy progress will be shown in the iTunes toolbar.\n\nOnce copied, simply eject your iPhone. Now open VLC app on your iPhone. You'll be able to access your music files there, in the original format that you copied. You can playback the music like a normal music player and can even listen to it in the background.\n\nI also turned on Bluetooth on a laptop and the iPhone and the laptop did not see the iPhone on the Windows Bluetooth program. So, how do I manually copy music from Windows to an iPhone?\n\nIt is not possible to copy files from Windows PC to iPhone over Bluetooth. Bluetooth is primarily used on iPhone/iPad to connect to accessories and for limited form of file sharing between Apple devices using a technology called AirDrop.\n", "Q: How do I separate iMovie projects for backup and sharing? Whenever I create a movie in iMovie, it seems to lump it all into a single iMovie Library file.\nThis means I can't easily backup or share individual projects.\nI realize I can \"Show Package Contents\" on iMovie Library and try copying individual projects that way, but that is problematic... If I duplicate a project, for example, it doesn't copy Original Media. So I may think that I copied out the project when in fact it doesn't have all the files that are actually necessary to export/backup the project.\nFor example, if I have a single project, the structure might look like:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMovie Library\n\n\n*\n\n*Project A\n\n\n*\n\n*CurrentVersion.imovieevent\n\n*Original Media\n\n\n\n\nIf I copy Project A through the iMovie interface, it would generate:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMovie Library\n\n\n*\n\n*Project A\n\n\n*\n\n*CurrentVersion.imovieevent\n\n*Original Media\n\n\n*Project B\n\n\n*\n\n*CurrentVersion.imovieevent\n\n\n\n\nNotice how there is no \"Original Media\" folder under Project B. Probably because we don't want to copy gigabytes of data.\nProblem is I might open up the iMovie Library, attempt to backup all of Project B's file by copying the Project B folder, and then end up only later on noticing that it didn't actually backup all the Original Media for the project.\nIs there a safer/more reliable way to use iMovie Libraries such that separate projects can be backed up or shared reliably?\n\nA: iMovie does support multiple libraries. \nHow to create a new library:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iMovie\n\n*Click on \"File\"\n\n*Hover on \"Open library\"\n\n*Click on \"New…\"\n\n*Select where you want that library to be stored.\n\n\nNow you got an extra library to which you can move any iMovie project, and then you'll be able to share what need to...\n\n\nA: Answer because I can't comment yet. I always create a new iMovie library for each project I do and store it in the folder with the source files on my hard drive.\n", "Q: What is the difference in weight between the minimum spec 2018 15\" Macbook Pro and the maximum spec? Apple's website lists only a single weight for a 2018 15\" Macbook Pro\nhttps://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/\n\nWeight: 4.02 pounds (1.83 kg)3\n3: Weight varies by configuration and manufacturing process.\n\nSo with memory, storage, cpu and gpu maxxed out what is the difference in weight?\n\nA: I doubt there’s any difference at all. Perhaps a few tens grams, but nothing that would change that it is about 1,8 kg.\n", "Q: Permission prompt has misaligned button and breaks input For at least two major macOS versions now, just about any time any programs requests elevated permissions, the OK button is misaligned and often missing text.\nFor example, on Mojave while updating Docker:\n\n(Apologies for the photo in place of a screenshot; input was too buggy at the time to take a proper screenshot, as explained below.)\nWhen the button is completely lacking text, such as in this screenshot, the corresponding button on the Touch Bar will also be blank.\nTypically, when a prompt with this bug is visible, interactions with any other window will be very buggy.  Spotlight will work fine, but input directed at other programs will be delayed or dropped entirely.  It could be delayed by seconds or even minutes.\nFor example, the dialog below the prompt in the screenshot is moveable, but any movements take about a minute to register.  This is somewhat expected, since it's waiting on input, but this will also happen with unrelated programs.  If I try to minimize a window, the first five clicks might not go through--ever.  The sixth might go through instantly.\nThese two issues are linked: when one is present, so is the other.  If the button is misaligned, input to other windows, with the exception of Spotlight, will be buggy.  While the first is just cosmetic, the second is problematic because it can interrupt my interactions with another application.  The cosmetic issue is a concern because it makes the security dialog look illegitimate, when I'm fairly certain it's the official Apple prompt.\nThese two issues happen with a wide variety of programs across many devices.  Why do they happen, and how can I resolve them?\nEdit: Here's an example of the same dialog triggered via authopen.  This one has neither issue.\n\n\nA: Bugs in macOS should be reported via https://bugreport.apple.com/. If it is within macOS or one of the core frameworks there isn’t a lot one can do as an end user. \n", "Q: What are the various ways to skip a song on youtube on 3rd generation Apple TV using the iOS remote app or Apple Watch remote app What are the various ways to skip a song on youtube on Apple TV using the iOS remote app or Apple Watch remote app?\nCurrently, it seems like the easiest way to do this is to just fast forward till the end of the song.\nWhat are the gestures on iPhone to skip a song and how can I do this on my Apple Watch?\n\nA: On iPhone\nIf a song is playing then go to details and you can press the two arrows at the bottom to fast forward/skip a song or you can tap the 10 icons to skip back or forward 10 seconds:\n\nFrom this Apple Support article:\n\nFast-forward: Tap the 10 icon to skip ten seconds ahead in a video.

Or tap\n  Rewind to rewind in a song.\n\nOn the Apple Watch\nTap the two arrows to skip/fast-forward or rewind the song:\n\nFrom this Apple Support article:\n\nTo play or pause your music, or to go to the previous or next track, use the controls in Remote.\n\n", "Q: How to have Farsi/Persian font in a single column of Numbers I've got a spreadsheet in Numbers which was a .xlsx file previously. In Windows I used to have one the columns of this spreadsheet to be shown in a Farsi/Persian/Iranian font. This column is only meant to show numbers in Farsi.\nWhen replicating this in Numbers by installing the same font I used in Windows and setting that column to use that font. However, it seems it just changes the numbers to that font, but instead of the numbers being written in Farsi numerals they are shown in the \"regular\" numerals like 1, 2, 3...\nI believe it's possible to just write each cell individually by changing the keyboard to Farsi, but this is an extensive column and I'd like to do this manually.\nI can try to provide further details if needed. Thank you!\n\nA: In Numbers go to:\nFile menu > Advanced > Language and Region\n\n\nSelect Persian from the dropdown list for the languages and then hit OK. \n\nThat will revert your numbers as well as the rest of the locale related settings to Persian.\n\nVoila!\n(You can do the same in Excel or the rest of the Office family).\nUpdate:\nNote that this method will change all numbers in your file to Persian. Seems like there's no proper way of having a bilingual sheet; you need at least two sheets one in each language. Also, if you want to retain everything and only apply it to one set of numbers, then, weirdly enough, you need to type any letter in Persian, then input your number. If the global language setting of the file is on English, it'll display the numerals in English, unless you keep at least a Persian letter before the digit in the cell. This is far from ideal, but I can't seem to find another work around this.\n", "Q: iPhone keeps restarting itself every 3 minutes I just got an iPhone 5 from my friend. It worked well and I decided to restore it to reset it. Yet it is now restarting itself every 3 minutes so I'm trying to do a factory restore. While letting it connected to my computer I pushed the top and menu button and went to iTunes. I get this message ~without any interaction~:\n\niTunes is downloading the software for this phone and will restore\n\n\n~It seems to be stuck, but it eventually restarted but~ it keeps restarting itself every 3 minutes.\nBetween restarts I can start to set the IPhone or even to use it a bit as everybody does if I was fast enough to set it.\nUpdate\nI think I achieved to reinstall the OS, but it keeps restarting itself every 3 minutes.\n\nA: Since using iTunes to restore the iPhone can't solve this problem, the following method is worth a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore all settings on your iPhone.\n\n*Update all applications or remove potentially conflicting applications\n\n*Remove the SIM card from the iPhone and check if it stops restarting\n\n*Check and clean the charging port\n\n*If you restart when charging, please replace the iPhone battery\nFinally, it is recommended to contact Apple officials for the best solution.\n\n\nhttps://www.fonecope.com/fix-iphone-keeps-restarting.html\n", "Q: Send clicks to multiple windows / spaces Is there a way to duplicate or send clicks to multiple (specific) windows or spaces?\nFor instance, an AutoHotkey script would look like the following to make three different clicks in three different windows.\nf2::\nMouseGetPos, xpos, ypos\nControlClick, x%xpos% y%ypos%, WindowA\nControlClick, x%xpos% y%ypos%, WindowB\nControlClick, x%xpos% y%ypos%, WindowC\n\nOn Windows I'd accomplish this through AutoHotkey, but that's not an option for MacOS.

They are not annoying but I want to know in case  it's bad.\nApparently there is a thing called dead pixel where there are pixels that lay on a screen and do nothing, but I am not sure if this happens on IPad becouse the times I saw about it was on somthing else.\n\nA: Yes, your iPad (any device with an LCD display) can get a dead (off) or a stuck (always on) pixel.\nIs it bad?\nNo. It will not affect the the performance of the device.  It’s analogous to a blown light in your house; while not detrimental, it can be annoying. \n", "Q: I erased an APFS Volume containing a second OSX installation (trying out Mojave) but my Mac keeps trying to boot into it I added a Second Volume to my Main APFS Container to install and try Mojave (I'm running High Sierra).  I decided that Mojave is not for me and I erased the volume from Disk Utility.  My Mac still tries to boot into Mojave by default when I restart my computer (it fails because that volume doesn't exist anymore). \nIn order to go into my High Sierra OS, I always have to boot with Alt pressed to choose the boot disk.  If I don't do this, I get the \"\" icon. \nThe weird thing is that this volume was indeed erased and does not appear on Disk Utility nor on the Startup Disk menu in System Preferences.\nHow can I fix this? I want to remove the \"Mojave\" Volume from the boot disks so that my computer will start normally when I turn it on.\nEDIT: I seem to have found something useful in this post, but it is for people who still haven't erased the volume from Disk Utility.  I don't know how to do it in my case, where I already erased it.\n\nA: You can change the default to boot High Sierra by either of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select High Sierra from the Startup Disk pain of the System Preferences application.\n\n*Hold down the control key when selecting High Sierra from the Startup Manager.\n\n\nYou still have Mojave code in your APFS container. In your case, do the opposite of the answer you linked to.\n\nBTW: You can also elect to not delete this code.

Is there any way to encrypt my drive with a private key, and no external tools (to be installed), and then unlock via command-line?\nI'm referring to my second drive and not my boot drive. I’m not keen on turning on file-fault. \n\nA: You can use APFS encryption (essentially FileVault) on a secondary drives such as USB drives etc. When formatting the drive with Disk Utility choose “APFS (Encrypted)”, and you’ll be asked for a password for the drive.\nWhen you plug in the secondary drive, macOS will automatically try to mount to mount it by opening a pop up asking you to enter the password to unlock.\nIf you literally want to use a private key, as in a key file (i.e. not a written password, but an encryption key) - then you’re out of luck.

I use launchd to run a bunch of shell scripts that update content on my site. It was working fine when it was just calling scripts normally.

I have 2 Mac's running High Sierra, Laptop and iMac.  I have enabled \"Wake for Network Access\" to facilitate waking the system up for Back to My Mac or some such.  Now, my iMac is almost never actually in sleep mode (being a desktop, I don't have it configured to automatically sleep).\nHere is what happened, there is a software package I have that has a bug, and automatically tries to reconnect to a voice chat that is over if it's been asleep for over and hour and wakes up.  It is in the works to be fixed, but has not been fixed yet (confirmed this with the developers).\nNow, 3 times in the middle of the night while I was asleep this behavior occurred.  I confirmed that my sleep monitor says I was asleep at the times in question.  Since I live alive, I'm not sure why or how the system would have been woken up from sleep.  The iMac was not asleep, but the MacBook was; and not on a wired connection.  I have a VPN provided by ZeroTier One (not a standard VPN as provided with OpenVPN protocols, LT2P or PPTP).\nSo here is my basic question...  Given that the iMac was awake, could it have received a broadcast packet from the VPN on ZeroTier, from a distant system connected via the VPN / Internet that unintentionally woke up my Laptop?  How would I find out if the Laptop woke up and what system triggered the wake up?  I have been looking and according to what I read, the computer won't know who or why it was triggered to wake up (unless I read it wrong).  My understanding of the \"sleep proxy\" of Bonjour is that a running system on the LAN could be used to trigger a system on the LAN to wake up based on a signal from a system on the VPN -- again, I could be horribly misunderstanding the protocol.\nIn short, how would I found out if this happened / is it even possible?\n\nA: Power settings, including sleep and wake:\nman pmset\nWhat settings are active?\npmset -g\nWhat is keeping your mac awake?\npmset -g assertions\nTo find out what woke up your mac, run this before sleep:\npmset -g assertionslog\nWhile this is running, you can find out the state of your assertions with CTRL-T\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   BackgroundTask                 0\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\n   UserIsActive                   1\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\n   ExternalMedia                  0\n   InternalPreventDisplaySleep    1\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0\n   NetworkClientActive            0\nListed by owning process:\n   pid 97(hidd): [0x0000c79b00099bde] 00:00:00 UserIsActive named: \"com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle.4294971710.3\" \n    Timeout will fire in 600 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease\n   pid 56(powerd): [0x0000e37c00108184] 00:01:04 InternalPreventDisplaySleep named: \"com.apple.powermanagement.delayDisplayOff\" \n    Timeout will fire in 235 secs Action=TimeoutActionTurnOff\nNo kernel assertions.\nIdle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler\n\nYou'll need to take a look at the internal state of mDNS.

I have a Windows 10 ISO that is 5.3 GB. The Boot Camp disk image that Boot Camp Assistant downloads is 2.8 GB. Together these are more than 8 GB.\nBoot Camp Assistant creates a partition named OSXRESERVED of 8 GB that (I think) serves as the the Windows installation medium. \nBoot Camp Assistant first copies the contents of the Windows 10 ISO to the OSXRESERVED partition.

For the older Macs, the steps for installing were outlined in the question How to install Windows 10 into a 2013 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, USB flash drive or third party tools? The answer is a bit outdated. I could update the answer if you post the output from diskutil list. I will admit that I am not sure if you would be better using the unattended install or not. In other words, I am not sure how exactly the OSXRESERVED partition is removed.\n\n*or B) tweak a 'OSXRESERVED partition size' setting in macOS that is used by Boot Camp Assistant and run it again?\nThere is nothing the the Boot Camp instructions for changing this partition size. The command defaults read com.apple.bootcampassistant does not show any useful defaults that could be changed.\nAnother problem to look out for is the use of the Windows Recovery Environment partition. In some cases, the partition is not allocated enough space. This can result in an empty partition.

The reason is that Thunderbolt is a low-latency, 10Gb/s (minimum) connection, which is far faster than the gigabit speeds you get from the adapter. Thunderbolt will have to wait for your ethernet adapter, not the other way around, which is exactly what you want.\nIf you're worried about the hard drive taking up some of the performance, keep in mind that the first iteration of Thunderbolt (the one you have) was designed with two lanes.

This means that the keyboard has a short startup time, only a few seconds, but enough that macOS apparently does not allow it enough time to start up between the USB initialization cycle and the deadline for detecting the startup key presses.\nI then tried again by attaching a second keyboard, but again the system would not respond to startup keys; the documentation is silent on the behavior of startup keys when more than one keyboard is connected or on how priority is determined.\nI was eventually able to get a startup key to working using an ancient keyboard, but I would not like to be stuck without a keyboard that cannot do this.\nWhat are the requirements for a keyboard to be able to invoke macOS startup keys?\n\nA: All USB keyboards have either a windows or command key so should work.\nThe connection method of Bluetooth can be bit more sketchy if it’s not an Apple keyboard due to pairing and wake / connect before the OS is loaded, so I would say use any wired USB keyboard you care to use if you can't pre-pair and test the keyboard to connect preOS boot.\n\nThe left windows key and the r key is all you need for Internet Recovery.

This problem came to my attention after less than 1 month of use. I updated Mojave to 10.14.2 hoping it would fix the problem, however the problem persists. The Mac is just over 2 months old.\nFreezing/hanging often often occurs upon saving a file. The file gets saved, but immediately after that the app (whichever app it is) becomes unusable. The problem seems to be closely tied to the file system.\n\n^ It is usually right after saving a file that problems begin.\nThis is a work machine, and one other employee at the company is experiencing the same issue with Mojave (on an older Mac). We both connect to the company LAN, and do Time Machine backups over the LAN.\nAccording to Disk Utility, nothing appears to be wrong with Macintosh HD:\nRunning First Aid on “Macintosh HD” (disk2s1)\n\nNOTE: First Aid will temporarily lock the startup volume.\n\nVerifying file system.\nVolume could not be unmounted.\nUsing live mode.\nPerforming fsck_apfs -n -l -x /dev/rdisk2s1\nChecking the container superblock.\nChecking the fusion superblock.\nChecking the EFI jumpstart record.\nChecking the space manager.\nChecking the space manager free queue trees.\nChecking the object map.\nChecking the Fusion data structures.\nChecking volume.\nChecking the APFS volume superblock.\nThe volume Macintosh HD was formatted by hfs_convert (945.200.129) and last modified by apfs_kext (945.230.6).\nChecking the object map.\nChecking the snapshot metadata tree.\nChecking the snapshot metadata.\nChecking snapshot 1 of 2.\nChecking snapshot 2 of 2.\nChecking the extent ref tree.\nChecking the fsroot tree.\nVerifying allocated space.\nPerforming deferred repairs.\nThe volume /dev/rdisk2s1 appears to be OK.\nFile system check exit code is 0.\n\nOperation successful.\n\nCrash report comparison\nThere's a lot of data to sort through, in crashes for multiple applications, so while it's hard to know what exactly to look for, the following lines look like they might provide a clue.\nI used Compare Side-By-Side in Sublime Text.

But I still would like to know the cause of it, and if there's a way to still run scheduled Time Machine backups over the network without experiencing severe system problems. I can provide more details upon request.\n\nA: I fixed my issues by clearing up some network shares that couldn't connect. I had three network shares in my user's System Preferences>Users>Login Items. These were all on a server that I couldn't connect to at the time.\nFor some reason when I opened either Slack or Zoom, they'd attempt to connect to that server.\nI can't think why either of those apps were trying to connect there. Zoom especially I've never used its file management or open/save dialogs.\nI restarted my network Mac server to restore its filesharing abilities and now my problems have gone away.\n--\nMore testing. Seems like when Slack opens, it attempts to load all Network Shares the user has in their Startup Items. (Another person noticed this behaviour in this Reddit thread.)\n", "Q: Partitioning a Windows drive? I'd like to partition a hard drive with Windows installed on it (with bootcamp). I've tried using Disk Utility and GParted to do this, but unfortunately neither would let me. Are there any other programs I can use to partition the hard drive?\n\nA: A partition with a NTFS volume can be resized by booting to the Windows installation  media. This can be in the form of a DVD, flash drive or partition on a drive. The type depends on the model/year of your Mac. The command to use is diskpart.\nUpdate:\nIf you macOS is High Sierra or Mojave, you can make a bootable Windows USB flash drive by using any of methods outlined in this answer. I assume your Windows is installed to EFI boot. If not post a comment. I assume you know how to boot to the flash drive installer. If not post a comment.\nIf first window to appear after select to boot from the flash drive should be the same as the image shown below.\n\nWhen the above window appears, press the shift+F10 keys. This will open a Command Prompt window.\nIf you are having problems with the Windows volume, you may want to try repairing with chkdsk. The command below checks drive C, but does not make repairs.\nchkdsk c:\n\nThe command below will attempt repairs. \nchkdsk c: /f\n\nIf you get the message shown below, then close and reopen the Command Prompt window. Try the command again.\nChkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another\nprocess. Chkdsk may run if this volume is dismounted first.\nWould you like to force to dismount on this volume? (Y/N)\n\nYou can also check the volume for physical defects in the sectors. If found, an attempt is made to mark the bad sectors as unusable. This type of checking takes a very very very long time to complete.\nchkdsk c: /b\n\nYou can use the diskpart command to shrink the NTFS volume C:.  After entering the command, you can get a list of all diskpart commands by entering help.\nTo get help for the shrink command enter the following.\nhelp shrink\n\nTo see how small you can shrink volume C:, enter the following commands. If you get to small a value, then try booting to Windows and running the disk defragmenter.\nselect volume c\nshrink querymax\n\nTo create a new 75 GB partition below volume C:, enter the following.\nselect volume c\nshrink desired=75000\ncreate partition primary\nformat fs=ntfs label=\"NewNTFS\" quick\nFor ExFAT, substitute the following for the format command.\nformat fs=exfat label=\"NewExFAT\" quick\n\nIf you want a FAT32 format, you probably will have to format with the macOS Disk Utility application.\nWhen finished, close both windows.\nUpdate 2\nYou can not enter all the commands on the same line. Entering the following will not work.\nselect volume c shrink desired=35000 create partition primary format fs=exfat label=\"NewExFat\" quick\n\nInstead enter the following\nselect volume c\nshrink desired=35000\ncreate partition primary\nformat fs=exfat label=\"NewExFat\" quick\n\nBelow is an example where these commands are used.\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.107]\n(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation.

You could try a third-party utility, though: https://www.paragon-software.com/mac/bootcamp.html \n", "Q: APFS Encrypted vs APFS + FileVault? I upgraded the SSD in a Mac Mini and I'm reinstalling Mojave via internet recovery.\nThe disk is completely erased right now, and when creating a new partition it asks me if I want to choose APFS or APFS (Encrypted).\nI want full encryption on the drive. Should I go with APFS then enable FileVault later on, or simply partition the disk with APFS (Encrypted)?\n\nA: I tested both options on my own: on Mojave installing on a new disk with  APFS (Encrypted) results in a fully working system with FileVault already enabled.\n", "Q: Siri does not recognize Apple Music on macOS When instructing Siri to play something on macOS that is not in my music library, it says, for instance, \"You don't have anything by [artist] in your music\".\nI can see that it suggests other sources, including Apple Music.\n\nIt does not work on the latest macOS (10.14.2, 2018 MacBook Pro), but it does on iPhone Xs with the same Apple ID and subscription. When I open iTunes, I can see that the subscription is active and I can play content from there.\nIs there a setting that enables Apple Music as source for Siri on a Mac?\n\nA: Make sure that you are using the same Apple ID.\nFrom this Apple Support article:\n\nMac: From the menu bar at the top of your computer screen, choose iTunes > Preferences.\nOn the General tab, select iCloud Music Library to turn it on. You won’t see an option to turn on iCloud Music Library until you sign up for Apple Music or iTunes Match.\nClick OK.\n\n\nA: After a while, Siri started using Apple Music on the Mac as well.\n", "Q: Is it not possible to make Apple Watch chime on the hour? It's pretty common to have watches announce the beginning of a new time interval (say to beep every hour). Mac OS X allows users to have the system \"announce the time\" down to the quarter of hour. \nIs there a way for Apple Watch users to do something similar?\n\nA: There's currently no native way to play a chime on the hour with watchOS - well, at least not without workarounds using the Timer, Reminders, etc.\nHowever, there are a number of 3rd party Apple Watch apps available that provide this functionality. Below are just a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*Little Ben\n\n*Cuckoo Watch\n\n*Diii\n\nA: Not sure since which release (may be it was there at the time I asked this question) but there's built-in feature that chimes down to each quarter of hour — not intuitively at all you can find it under Accessibility (in Settings).\n\n", "Q: 'No such file' when running rm AppleSetupDone from single-user mode I'm in High Sierra (10.13.6) and recently I renamed my account in Users & Group.

If no message is shown, the command was successful, much like /sbin/mount -uw /. Enter precisely the following, followed by ⏎ Enter/Return:\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*With the first command, there's no need to keep re-running it, and no need to run it differently, it worked first try when you didn't receive an error.\n\n*With the second command, all three tries missed the space between rm and /var. Make sure the space is typed.\n\n\nYou should not receive a message for either command and will be returned to the prompt (#) after each is executed. Finally, run reboot.\n\nA: For some reason I could just not find the .AppleSetupDone file anywhere it was supposed to be, and I was also a little confused about whether it would be on the Macintosh HD - Data volume or the Macintosh HD volume, so I eventually just decided to do a find command on all of the mounted volumes which worked great because it turned up under Macintosh HD - Data/private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone for some reason, not really sure why.\nAnyway after I found it there the rm command worked fine.\nSo I guess if you've tried everything and you're still really not finding the .AppleSetupDone file you can check in the directory I mentioned or just run the find command from the root folder /\nI did find . -iname \"*setupdone*\"\n", "Q: Bash Alt+Arrow keyboard combination not working in Terminal under Mojave I just migrated to Mojave from El Capitan.

Since the introduction of the floating screenshot thumbnail, I have been unable to drag these thumbnails to most applications, with few exceptions such as Telegram and Notes.\nI'm not sure how something as prominent as this draggable thumbnail is incompatible with the rest of macOS's drag and drop systems, so I feel like I'm missing something.\nAn example of an app that won't support this (but supports normal file drag&drop from Finder) is Slack. In fact, I really struggle with this one as one of my main use-cases is taking screenshots and sending them via Slack. I currently right-click on the thumbnail, copy it to the clipboard, then paste into Slack.\nIs there a way to get full drag&drop functionality on macOS's screenshot thumbnails?\n\nA: *\n\n*Take the screenshot (My favourite shortcut is ⌘ + Shift + 4)\n\n*Double click the miniature\n\n*In the \"editor\" click share button and select Mail\n\n*You'll see a mail compose window. Drag the picture to the application you originally wanted to drop to (e.g. Slack).\n\n\nA: The best workaround I've found is adding the Desktop (or wherever you keep your screenshots) folder to the dock and disabling the thumbnail, this way I can easily drag and drop a recent screenshot.\n", "Q: Can I listen music from USB-C port by using USB-C/Jack adapter trough MacBook Pro?

I'm recommending it because it looks like it does what you want and it's free.\n\nA: I tried an app called Natural Reader and it does a decent job, but the voices are terrible and it isn't quite as seamless as iOS's integration. I really only want this for Safari so I guess I'll just have to Airdrop the link to my nearby iPhone or iPad and initiate the screen reader gesture there. Natural Reader does have a great Chrome Extension so I am hoping with Big Sur and the new ability to easily port Chrome Extensions to Safari that they will do that soon and let us use all of the system voices; I much prefer the UK Male Safari voice to any of Natural Reader's voice, free and paid.\n", "Q: Is it possible to mix APFS and HFS+ volumes on the same physical disk? I wish to have two volumes on a drive (not SSD); one HFS+, one APFS.\nWould it be possible to have these on an HFS+ partition or APFS?\n\nA: Well, you would need a separate partition for each volume type. In other words, APFS type partitions can hold multiple volumes, but each must be a APFS volume. HFS+ type partitions can hold a single volume which must by HFS+ type.\nIn addition the first partition is usually a EFI type partition which contains a single volume of FAT32 type. So, you would need at least a total of three partitions on the drive.\n\nNo single partition type can support both HFS+ and APFS volumes.\n\n", "Q: How to restore messages when Messages in iCloud is enabled? How can I restore deleted messages when Messages in iCloud is enabled?\nHistorically one would just restore the iPhone to an earlier iCloud Backup however I have attempted to do that but since Messages in iCloud is enabled the deleted messages are not restored.\nBy paying for increased iCloud storage and having regular iCloud Backups one would hope that there is some way to restore these deleted messages even with Messages in iCloud enabled?\n\nA: Messages are not included in your iCloud backup as they automatically upload to iCloud. After you restore to a backup you need to stay  connected to iCloud and your messages will download.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nWhen you use Messages in iCloud, your text messages automatically upload to iCloud. They aren’t included in your backup. After you restore your device from iCloud Backup, stay connected to Wi-Fi so that your text messages can begin to download.\n\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nWhen you delete a message, photo, or conversation on one device, it’s removed from all of your devices. And since all of your attachments are stored in iCloud, you can save space on your device.​\n\nIf the messages are deleted it is not possible to recover them:\n\nCorrect, my assumption (incorrect it seems) was that because the message history is now stored in iCloud, a message could be deleted from my device, but the message history could be accessed/reloaded again later. It seems that's not the case.\n\n", "Q: Disk format for HDD with both APFS and HFS+ volumes For a HDD which will have both HFS+ and APFS volumes, is it better to format the disk itself in Disk Utility (on High Sierra) as APFS or HFS+?\n\nA: I have done this by starting with a whole disk APFS partition, I believe.  I gave the whole disk to APFS, and then I followed the directions in this article to shrink the APFS partition:\nhttps://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/resize-your-apfs-container/\nThis freed up unused space on the disk, which I think I was able to assign to a new partition in HFS+ format using Disk Utility.  I needed to do this because I wanted to have a ZFS partition on the same disk with an APFS boot partition, and ZFS doesn't really interface with APFS (ZFS can replace an HFS+ partition, though).\n", "Q: Add tags to equations in Pages Pages has since a relatively recent update a very useful way to insert equations using LaTeX and/or MathML syntax. \nOn multiple occasions, I have wanted to add tags to equations—a custom equation number on the right side of the equation. However, the \\tag{} command doesn't seem to work in Pages. Is there any other way I can achieve this? \nThree possibilities which come to mind are a) using a table with two cells, putting the equation in the left one and the equation number on the right, b) adding the equation text above or below the equation (but unfortunately not to the right), or c) adding spaces and then the tag manually (which seems to be a terrible idea). Is there a better way to do it? \n\nA: \\tag is part of the amsmath LaTeX package rather than LaTeX itself. Pages doesn't support ams.\nInternally, Pages uses blahtex to generate PNGs from the rudimentary maths environments. These individual equations don't have context of the page width, so it's not possible to add a correct amount of right spacing automatically within the equation environment.\nHowever, Pages can do this. You can use the ruler to correctly center align the equation, and right align content outside of the equation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Optional Create a new paragraph style for your equation lines. This preserves the ruler adjustments so you don't have to recreate this manually for each equation. Use the blue Update paragraph style button each time you make a change to the style to preserve the adjustment.\n\n\n*Create two tab stops:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Half width, center aligned. This becomes the center alignment for the equation.\nHalf width can be calculated by taking the 1 column width shown at the top of Layout (here, 17 cm) and dividing by 2 (here, 8.5 cm).\n\n*Full width, right aligned. This becomes the right alignment for the tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In a paragraph of your new equation paragraph style, press Tab. Insert your equation as normal. This will be center aligned on the page.\n\n*After your equation, press Tab. Insert the tag for the equation, which will be auto. right-aligned.\n\n", "Q: External hard disk use I have a question: when attaching my external hard disk to my Mac, there seem to be a little ghost that deletes my files.\n\nCan anyone please give me some information on this, please note that I am not a Mac expert, I do use the maximum security allowed by Apple and my network but I have the feeling something is not right and would appreciate it very much if someone could help?\n\nA: Well it appears that the files are cache files and are deleted regularly as part of keeping the drive clean and not cluttered with random thumbnails/logs/whatever other cache files are stored. Its pretty obvious from the entry that operation run is CACHE_DELETE so I wouldn't worry too much.\nAlso, from the image it says \"category: daemon\". If you are not aware, a daemon is a background process that takes care of small nitty-gritty things for you, like starting services, clearing unneeded caches, and many many more. You can utilise certain daemons to regularly run tasks for you like cron for example. Its nothing to be worried about and its vital to any operating system.\nIf you are suspicious of malware, you could regularly check the files on your drive by running du -sh every so often to see the space used on the drive. If there is space free that you did not delete, then it may be the case. There are many other ways to check for malware deleting files theoretically (antivirus, disk space, running processes etc) - but if you do have malware on there without your knowledge, then you have much larger problems than it deleting your cache for you :) \n", "Q: Unusual icon on iPad screen How do I remove 3 arrows in a black rectangle on the top right of my iPad screen?

And even if you quit out of terminal all that history is remembered across sessions. Well not back to the beginning of time but BASH remembers a substantial history of commands.\nYou can string multiple commands together with \"&&\" :\ncd /users/steve/desktop && rem picture.jpg\n\nThat will CD to my user profile and then delete a file called picture.jpg\nBooks (literally) have been written on the BASH shell and a little searching around the internet will come up with quite a lot of information on navigating, using, programming/scripting. if you don't specify the BASH shell on macOS you'll get a lot of Linux results which are generally applicable but many of the commands are different.\nIf you are really interested in geeking out you can change to a different shell, there are several built-in, or another terminal program that has more features than the one that comes with macOS. Finding and using said options will be left up to you in the spirit of exploration.\n", "Q: Deleting contacts on iCloud does not remove them from iPhone I've used iCloud's website to clean up contacts that were imported and the changes work...except - if I delete a contact on the iCloud website it does not get deleted on the iPhone.

Alternatively, can I create a temporary token to send to the server, so that it can access the file? Then, when transcoding is complete, can I write back to the iCloud Drive?\nI'm mostly trying to avoid uploading the entire file from the device to the server, because the files might be quite large.\nI'm also trying to use iCloud Drive to support the seamless file sync between device and mac laptop without having to explicitly authenticate - that type of thing isn't supported by google drive, or dropbox, correct? \nThanks very much in advance, I appreciate any help at all!\n\nA: CloudKit\nApple offers CloudKit, which achieves something very similar to what you are describing.\nIf you're able to write an application both for your Mac and iOS device, you can sync data and files across devices relatively easily. For example, CloudKit allows you to store files and data in a free database, process it however you want in your apps, then re-upload it to the database. All of this happens without any explicit authentication.\n\nThe CloudKit framework provides interfaces for moving data between\n  your app and your iCloud containers. You use CloudKit to take your\n  app’s existing data and store it in the cloud so that the user can\n  access it on multiple devices. You can also store data in a public\n  area where all users can access it.\n\nCloudKit | Apple Developer Documentation\nKeep in mind that while CloudKit itself free and easy to use, there is a caveat; You have to have a paid Developer account, which costs $99 a year.\nI would highly recommend you look into CloudKit and check out Apple's (outdated) CloudKit Quick Start guide to get a feel for how programming for it actually looks.\nAccess from Non-Apple Platforms\nWhile CloudKit works best when used on an Apple device, it is certainly possible to interact with a CloudKit container with more platform agnostic methods.\nThe best solution may be to use CloudKit web services. This allows you to use either more traditional HTTP methods or JavaScript to interact with CloudKit data.\nThe part of CloudKit web services that has more up to date documentation is CloudKit JS, a JavaScript API for CloudKit.\nKeep in mind that with either of these options, Apple says that, “You must have an existing CloudKit app and enable web services.” Details on how to setup CloudKit web service are in the linked CloudKit JS guide\n", "Q: Windows 10 install on mid 2010 Mac Pro - \"EFI boot\" is not in startup manager I have been working towards installing Windows 10 on my mid-2010 Mac Pro and have been using the following thread as a guide: said thread. I've formatted both my BOOTCAMP volume (where I plan on installing Windows), and the USB drive being used to boot from, to ExFat. As of now, the Windows 10 ISO and the Windows support software has been mounted and copied onto my BOOTCAMP volume, and I've modified the .xml filename as well as disabled the ability to EFI boot from the BOOTCAMP volume. I've also copied the same content (Windows 10 ISO, Windows support software), except here I didn't disable the ability to EFI boot. I've basically made it to step 10 in the thread I was following.\nThe problem occurs when I reboot my computer. I do so by holding down the option key during startup to access the Startup Manager. I expect to see EFI boot as an option to select and boot from, but my USB (EFI boot) is not there. The only options I have are my internal drives and the Recovery drive, but no USB or EFI boot option. I've gone back to the guide in order to ensure I've done everything right, but can't find a reason for why I can't boot from my USB drive - maybe the ExFat partitioning scheme is wrong for this process? \nAny insight would be greatly appreciated as I've been working on this for a few days now and would love to find a solution. \nThank you so much in advance.\n\nA: What can I say. If your Mac will not boot, then that is that. My 2011 iMac could boot Windows this way after a High Sierra installer update to the Mac's firmware. I assumed that all Macs would be able to boot this way after installing either High Sierra or Mojave. Either I am wrong or you made a mistake. \nWhen I originally posted this answer, the instructions FAT32 formatted the drives. This was changed to ExFAT after the October 2018 release of Windows 10. This ISO contains a file that exceeds FAT32 formatted drive limit of 4 GB per file. The April 2018 update does not have this problem.\nIf you can not get Windows installed using the method in your linked thread, then consider trying one of the older more complex methods.

(The settings for the screenshot app do not provide this feature).\n\nA: The default behavior is to display a thumbnail of the image for a short delay before writing the image to the Documents folder. An alternative would be to set the Clipboard as the Save to in the Screenshot options. In this case, the image is placed in the clipboard instead of being written to a file. You can then paste the image. Here, no thumbnail is displayed, but the image in the clipboard can be viewed in the Finder. (From the Finder menu bar, select Edit➝Show Clipboard). If you need to drag and drop the image, then one method would be to set Preview as the Save to in the Screenshot options. From the Preview application menu bar, select View➝Thumbnails or the option+⌘+2 key combination. You can drag and drop the thumbnail. \nI realize your question was to increase the delay. This answer attempts to point out alternatives to having the image end up being saved to the Documents folder by default after the delay has expired.\n", "Q: How to recycle some magnetic disk of System on Mac OS?

It seems to happen randomly.\nI do on-site repair work, always going to a different location. So I use my navigation almost daily. I just use regular old Apple Maps. Sometimes I type in an address, sometimes I tell siri. Occasionally I send the maps over from my home computer (which may be one of the triggers of this, I'll need to do more testing).\nSo normally you pick your address, you hit \"GO\" and you're off with maps and verbal turn-by-turn directions. When this no-navigating problem happens, you hit GO, and you get a map, but it's as if you haven't actually picked your router. Yet somehow you get sort of an overview summary of the 'steps' of your directions, but it doesn't read them to you, or indicate turns coming up. Yet it knows exactly where you are. You can have your waypoint drive right down the route tracking you, and theres a blue route line, but they aren't \"linked\". It's extremely annoying. There doesn't seem to be a way to KICK it into navigating. The day I took the screen shot below, I was repeatedly cancelling navigation, and reinitializing my route, but it kept getting stuck and not giving me directions. \nDoes anyone else ever have this problem on their iPhone? My phone is an iPhone 8 running the newest iOS. I've had this problem in the past on my 6S too. \n\n\nA: This happens whenever the \"From\" location is a fixed address, rather than \"Current location\". Even if that address is your current location when you start, Maps will be in a different mode, as you have discovered.\nTo switch from the static navigation mode to turn-by-turn mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap End.\n\n*Choose those directions again.\n\n*Don't tap Go yet. Tap the blue text after \"From\".\n\n*Replace the text there with \"Current location\" and tap Route.\n\n*Now tap Go.\n\n\nRoutes with a fixed start address would probably be from Apple Maps on your Mac, which doesn't offer turn-by-turn directions. If you want to remove these from your history on your iPhone, swipe left on those items in the list.\n", "Q: Stuck with an old version of MacOS I have a 13-inch, Mid 2010 MacBook and I am stuck with the version 10.11.6, I am not able to  make any upgrade. Currently I am not able to download any app from the App Store (only old versions) and I am afraid, soon I will not be able to update some applications (as Unity, VS and GitHub Desktop). Could you help me with any solution? I do not really want to stick with old version on my applications. The replacing of my Mac is not an option\n\nA: From the looks of the details on EveryMac.com your Mac will take up to macOS 10.13.x (High Sierra).\nApple's current macOS version is 10.14.x so you are actually in pretty good shape as far as that goes. High Sierra is still getting security updates and most released software will work on the last 2 to 3 macOS versions. Many will work on versions earlier than that.\nYou should be able to sign into the App Store and download macOS High Sierra. here is a link that will open that up in iTunes, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12\nOnce you have upgraded to High Sierra that will be the last major revision of macOS that is supported on your Mac. Depending on your needs and the apps that you use you may need to get yourself a newer Mac that supports macOS Mojave (10.14) and later. But IMHO you probably have a couple of years (at least) of life left in your current Mac.\n", "Q: Can I automatically mark/categorize photos as \"uploaded\" on iPhone? I take a lot of photos on my iPhone, and they occupy a significant percentage of my storage space. Many of these photos, however, are eventually uploaded to several services (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc). If I could \"delete all photos that have already been uploaded\", I could probably free up a lot of space. It seems this a \"already uploaded\" album would be something trivial to implement, however iOS doesn't seem to provide it out-of-the box. Am I right or am I missing something? Is there at least a third-party app that provides such a feature?\nPS: If this is not an appropriate question for this platform, I apologise. Just let me know and I'll remove it and post it elsewhere. If you could recommend a better place, I'd appreciate it.\n\nA: If you enable iCloud Photos, your iPhone can manage this for you automatically.\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > Photos and toggle on iCloud Photos to upload all your photos to your iCloud account (note, this process can take a long time, but it will run automatically in the background and only when you're on Wi-Fi).\nBelow that, you'll see two options: \"Optimize iPhone Storage\" and \"Download and Keep Originals.\" If you select \"Optimize iPhone Storage,\" iOS will automatically replace full-size photos in your local storage with thumbnails as space is needed, with the originals stored on iCloud. You can still browse your entire library locally, and if you tap on a thumbnail to view the full-size photo and it isn't already in your local storage, it will automatically download from iCloud in the background. The original will then remain in your local storage until iOS next decides to purge it, again based on available storage space.\nYou can see how much storage space you'll save before the full upload is complete (or even before you turn it on at all) by going to Settings > General > iPhone Storage and looking under \"Recommendations.\" In my case, my full photo library is 48.53 GB, and turning on Optimize Photos would save 47.02 GB – a 97% reduction! (I leave it off only because I have a 128 GB phone and plenty of available storage space).\nYou will likely need to purchase iCloud storage to fit all your photos, as your iCloud account only comes with 5 GB for free (in 2019, ridiculous!). However, 50 GB of iCloud storage only costs 99¢/month, and 200 GB of storage is only $2.99/month (you can also share 200 GB and larger plans with family members). I find it well worth it for the peace of mind having an online copy of all my photos, and for the ability to keep them in sync with my other devices (Mac, Apple TV, iCloud.com in any web browser, etc.).\n", "Q: Macbook mid-2010: no power after ssd upgrade I changed my HDD to a SSD using ifixit guide on my MacBook Unibody Model A1342 (mid-2010). \nBut after reconnecting the battery, the Mac seems to be dead (MagSafe light off, no chime, no fan, nothing). I tried another charger that works perfectly with another Mac with no success.\nAny chance that this is \"only\" a battery issue? Or has the logic board died? Is there any other possible solution?\nEDIT: Finally, I changed the logic board and the Macbook is back to life...\n\nA: No light on a MagSafe adapter means it's not seeing the (one wire) charging circuit of your MacBook Pro.\nSo, this is unfortunately not a battery issue.  It's further confirmed by no fan spin and the fact that you eliminated the charger from the equation by testing it (successfully) on a different computer.\nYou may have shorted something during your swap or it could be just coincidence.  However, there are a couple of things to check before resigning it's a logic board issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*check/clean your MagSafe port.  It could be just coincidence that your MagSafe port is dirty/blocked and preventing you from powering/charging your MacBook\n\n*double check your connections; you may have missed one or more or may have accidentally disconnected something.\n\n*check your DC In board.

See How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?\n\n*Copy High Sierra to a flash drive. See How to create a bootable installer for macOS\n\n*Install High Sierra to a new volume in your APFS container.

See How to create a bootable installer for macOS\n\n*Remove the High Sierra volume from your APFS container. See Remove macOS from a APFS container?\nAnother alternative would be to install High Sierra in a virtual machine. This would avoid the need to remove the High Sierra files from your APFS container volumes. Installing in the virtual machine application does require modifying your current macOS (Mojave). While removing the High Sierra virtual machine would be fairly easy, removing the virtual machine application would probably not be a good idea. So, once you install a virtual machine application, you will probably not want to uninstall. \nPersonally, I have only run Snow Leopard and Yosemite in VirtualBox virtual machines. Other virtual machine applications are VMware Fusion and Parallels. User @user3439894 has posted in a comment a preference for VMware Fusion which was used to run High Sierra.\nIf you choose to use a virtual machine and are having problems setting up, you may want to post a new question.\n", "Q: Extend \"Hey Siri\" Timeout?

This is on a Mac Pro 2013\n\nA: You appear to have created USB flash drive Windows 10 installers by using both rufus and and the Microsoft media creation tool. Both of these methods bypass the use of the Boot Camp Assistant. You are suppose to use the Boot Camp Assistant to copy the files to the USB flash drive.\nYou should go to this website from Microsoft and download Window 10. The last time I checked, the October 2018 update (1809) will not work with BootCamp. This only applies to older Macs that use a flash drive to install Windows. This includes your Mac.

It seems to me that only some songs that were already liked when I created the playlist that are missing.\n\nA: I can confirm that somehow my library was the one out of sync. Songs that my computer thought were marked as liked were not marked as liked on my phone.\n\nA: A song loved on your computer doesn't mostly show up as loved on your iphone, while a song loved on an iphone is always showed as loved on a computer version of Apple Music.\nSolution is to first add the song to your library on your computer and then loved it. Then it's auto synced to your iPhone.\n", "Q: Reclaiming occupied space A MBPro with a 250GB running the latest Mojave suddenly went from 100GB+ of free space to 5GB and is warning us about running out. Looking at About>Storage>Manage, it seems most of the occupied space is System (168GB worth). Looking at things via the Finder, we only see about 90GB of stuff total and only 9GB in the System directory and 6GB in the main Library folder.  Running OmniDiskSweeper with the sudo command via Terminal, it confirms what the Finder is reporting…that there should be about 90GB instead of 245GB of stuff.  We also ran GrandPerspective and it does not “see” any inordinately large files.\nResearching a bit, I found some possibilities that haven’t panned out.\n1. it’s NOT local TimeMachine snapshots, as was the answer for some people\n2. it’s NOT a runaway Spotlight index, as it was for some people\n3. running TimeMachine did NOT clean things up, as reported by some\n4. revealing hidden files did NOT reveal anything out of the ordinary\n5. booting into Recovery Mode and running Disk Repair reported everything fine\nSome have thrown their hands up wiped out their hard drive and reinstalled (which has fixed this issue for some).\n The problem is, my friend with this laptop is traveling thru Europe and is not technically savvy. So, talking her through a full reinstall will be a big challenge.\nThere must be SOME way to see what’s occupying the space.   It would seem to me that perhaps there’s some that went wrong with the recent conversion from HFS+ to APFS when she installed Mojave. \nAny ideas on how to reclaim the space without reinstalling from scratch?\n\nA: Turns out the answer came out of left field. I had done a Spotlight rebuild, which didn't reclaim the space, but what it did do (I think) is change totals in About>Storage>Manage. The System went down to 90GB (which is still high but better), but Mail jumped up to 95GB. That gave me the clue to look in the ~/Library/Mail folder. From here it gets weird.\nTurning on 'Calculate folder sizes' in the Finder, it calculated the Mail folder as 24GB.  However, underneath that folder were several \"mail container\" folders, one of which was 37GB besides another that was actually 24GB. Literally it didn't add up.\nInside of that 37GB folder was a Drafts mbox was 37GB all by itself!  \nOver in Apple Mail, she had no visible Drafts folders in any of the three accounts. I checked preferences to make sure each account was pointing to a server Drafts folder, and they were.  And when I created a new draft, it showed up properly.  So, the functionality was fine.\nSo, I figured out which Gmail account this huge Drafts folder belonged to (by watching the timestamps on the folders when I updated in Apple Mail), and then logged into that Gmail account via web. There I found a Drafts folder with hundreds and hundreds of emails with attachments (its normal for her to work with large PDFs).  These Drafts weren't getting deleting when she sent them.  So, I cleared all the Drafts off the server.  However, when I later launch Mail, the \"cleanup\" I was expecting didn't happen. Somehow, the Drafts mbox was a separate copy of these abandoned Drafts.\nSo I was left with quitting Apple Mail and Finder-trashing the 37GB Drafts mbox.  Even though the ~/Libary/Mail folder didn't gain any space, the overall hard drive free space did (as well as About>Storage>Manage).\nShe's got enough free space to work with now, but System still shows as 90GB and we don't know how she got into this predicament in the first place.  So, we don't know if this is the end of the saga.  (Perhaps because she travels a lot, she's \"offline\" a lot and Gmail is being ultra conservative saving her Drafts?) I suppose when she's back from her travels, I'll zap that email account and re-enter it, so it can download a fresh copy from the server. \n", "Q: Saving Terminal Color/Opacity Preferences My question is related to this question:\nTransparent Background in Terminal?\nI have successfully found the menu to change color/opacity. I used the \"homebrew\" profile. Then I attempted to change the opacity as shown in the answer. However, once I put the opacity at 100% and closed the window, it completely ignored my changes and went back to 90%. How do I actually ensure that my preferences are saved? There is no \"OK\" or \"apply\" button on the color menu.\n\nA: Clicking once (and only once) on the \"color and effects\" icon and adjusting the opacity should properly save any adjustments. Double-clicking may have caused the issue.\n\nA: This took me a while, but for profile changes like making Homebrew your profile, double click the option as there is nowhere to 'save' on this on mac.\n\nA: I could make the opacity setting stick this way with MacOS 10.14 (Mojave).\nFirst, with a Terminal window open, I selected Shell -> Edit Background Color and there used the Opacity slider. This changed the opacity for the active window.\nThen I selected Shell -> Use Settings as Default. This changed the opacity in all open windows. New windows now also have the desired opacity.\n\nA: My contribution is more of a help, not really a solution, but maybe you could use it. What if you have changed the appearance of the terminal but you don't really like it? With this code you can reset it at any time.\nrm $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist; killall Terminal\n\n", "Q: How to prevent iOS from styling an emoji? Look at these characters: ︎︎\nDepending on your device, they'll look like this (a Windows screenshot of a Facebook comment):\n\n\n\nNotice how the 2nd and 4th emojis are flat rather than stylized*. It's because I inserted an invisible U+FE0E character after each to tell devices not to change the appearance of the character.\nHowever, on the Facebook iOS app, they look like this:\n\n\n\nIt seems that iOS isn't honoring the Variation Selector-15 (U+FE0E) character and stylizes all of the emoji characters.\nHow can I force emojis to appear as the basic flat text version?\n\n* P.S. As a side note, when I inspected the HTML on Windows, this is what I saw, which I guess is how Facebook's website replaces the emojis with their own images whenever U+FE0E isn't present:\n<span class=\"_3l3x\">\n<span>\n<span class=\"_5mfr\">\n<span class=\"_6qdm\" style=\"height: 16px; width: 16px; font-size: 16px; background-image: url(&quot;https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6e/1/16/1f4ac.png&quot;);\"></span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"_4ay8 _3kkw\">︎</span>  \n<span class=\"_5mfr\">\n<span class=\"_6qdm\" style=\"height: 16px; width: 16px; font-size: 16px; background-image: url(&quot;https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf/1/16/1f304.png&quot;);\"></span>\n</span> \n<span class=\"_4ay8 _3kkw\">︎</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n\n\nA: I think the problem is that iOS uses the Apple Color Emoji font for everything, and this font does not yet honor the mechanism for making characters text format.  The only way to get around that is to use css or similar means to force iOS to use a different font which only has text versions.\n", "Q: Rebuilding old HDD My mac is turning 5 years now, it runs already long on SDD and old HDD is in  an optibay. But HDD is a stock one and is turning 5 years as well. It's working ok, but tests with Disk warrior, Tech Tool and DriveDx indicated 2 bad blocks, besides I had issues with a couple of big files. And as I assume there can appear more.\nAs far as I know, HDDs have a special reserved space, that gets used, when bad blocks are found. So the question is can this reserved space be extended? If yes, then what software would you recommend for that?\n\nA: \nSo the question is can this reserved space be extended?\n\nNo, it cannot.\nHard disk failures tend to be catastrophic in nature -- if enough sectors have failed that you have exhausted the built-in reserve and you are seeing \"issues with a couple of big files\", your hard disk is likely in the process of failing, and no amount of additional spare space will save it.\nYou need to discontinue all use of this drive until you can back it up and replace it. Any further use is likely to result in data loss.\n", "Q: iPhone X, iOS 12.1.2 - Whatsapp concern I am looking for a specific setting within whatsapp. Namely, i wish to set the notifications in a way that the only visible thing is \"notification\" rather than the current Name+Surname+Notification/content of message (if unlocked). is there a way to set it that way? i went through all the setting and i can't seem to make it work? \nthanks guys! \n\nA: You can change this option for any installed app in the Notifications section of the iOS Settings app. Tap on the appropriate app; at the bottom of the notifications setting screen, you can disable \"Show Previews\" (or set it to \"When Unlocked\") to prevent any details from being shown on your lock screen.\n", "Q: remove homebrew apache2 fails On a new Macbook Pro, I installed apache2 with homebrew, but now want to switch back to native apache2 server.\nI removed the homebrew package with:\nbrew uninstall apache2\n\nI also removed any homebrew launch links from these directories:\nls /Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchAgents/:\ncom.microsoft.update.agent.plist     \ncom.teamviewer.teamviewer.plist      \ncom.teamviewer.teamviewer_desktop.plist\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/:\ncom.microsoft.OneDriveUpdaterDaemon.plist    \ncom.teamviewer.Helper.plist\ncom.microsoft.autoupdate.helper.plist        \ncom.teamviewer.teamviewer_service.plist\ncom.microsoft.office.licensingV2.helper.plist\n/Users/jd/Library/LaunchAgents/:\ncom.google.keystone.agent.plist com.jetbrains.toolbox.plist\n\nBut even after reboot, I believe Homebrew apache is still running:\nsudo /usr/sbin/apachectl \nPassword:\nhttpd: Syntax error on line 67 of /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf: Cannot load lib/httpd/modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so into server: dlopen(/Users/jd/projects/lib/httpd/modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so, 10): image not found\n\nThis module is referenced from /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf, which I believe is homebrew.

Among other things, this allowed me to turn off location tracking by applications that do not need location and that cannot be trusted with it, specifically Whatsapp. \nI am thinking of buying a iphone next, but a second hand, because i do not need a flashy phone. It will be easier getting my pictures from the phone to the computer, if nothing else. \nMy questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*From which version onwards does iphone support turning off location access for specific apps? I'm under the impression this is possible on new iPhones, maybe i'm wrong.\n\n*What other privacy related features can i expect? For example can i prevent an application that does not need it from accessing my contacts?\n\n\nA: In iOS…\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps get no permissions when you install them.\n\n*Apps on iOS can never use features like Location Services without a run-time OS-level prompt for access.\n\n\niOS itself controls all access to such features, for all apps including those built-in to iOS and those downloaded from the App Store. No app can access functionality without you explicitly providing permission when running the app and the app requesting it. All privacy settings on iOS are per-app (with a system-wide off switch too).\niOS expanded the privacy controls in iOS 8 (September 2014) released as a free update to iPhone 4s (2011) and later. iOS privacy controls determine access to Location Services, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos, Bluetooth, Microphone, Speech Recognition, Camera, Health data, HomeKit, Media (Apple Music), Motion & Fitness.\n\n\n\n\nAbout privacy and Location Services in iOS 8 and later - Apple\n\nApps from the App Store may request access to things such as your location, contacts, calendars or photos. You’ll receive a prompt with an explanation the first time a third-party app wants to use this data, so you can make an informed decision about granting permission. Even if you grant access once, you can always change it later in Settings.\n\nManage Your Privacy - Apple\n\nA: When apps use location tracking they request permission. The overall control for that is found in Settings > Privacy > Location Services. \nAlso, under Privacy you can select an app to see what permissions are set for each service, i.e. Contacts\n", "Q: Connecting from iOS to macOS using ssh Because of the OpenSSH iOS tweak and NewTerm (my phone is jailbroken), I'm able to connect from my computer to my phone using ssh:\n$ ssh mobile@myphonesip\nmobile@myphonesip's password: \nmyphonesname~ mobile$\n\nThis is pretty great and all, but I would also like to connect to my computer from my phone using ssh.

Four of them. I'm using an Apple 27-inch Thunderbolt display that has an Apple adapter to convert to the USB-C.\nIf I'm listening to music - for example on YouTube - the AirPods work just fine. I get audio and it sounds great. When I try to use Google Hangouts with video sourced from the external monitor's camera, the video works just fine but I get no audio with the AirPods. If I disconnect from the external monitor and use a video Hangout sourcing the video from the built-in camera, the AirPods work just fine. If I use the Hangout without audio at all, the AirPods work just fine, too.\nConsidering this, it seems like there's something breaking whenever I'm getting video from the external monitor.\nIs there something about my setup that would prevent the audio from working in this situation?\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a set of wireless headphones that have a USB dongle that I plug into the monitor and this works just fine, too (assuming I remember to turn them on).\n\n*I've not tried to use the AirPods when connected to the external monitor but using the built-in camera on the MBP.\n\n\nA: After weeks of poking at this, I've managed to figure it out.\nThis actually had nothing to do with the AirPods or the external monitor, rather the problem was that Google Hangouts has its own settings to choose which devices are being used for input/output that overrides the system settings. So, while I was frantically trying to change which device was supplying in/out in the system preferences, Hangouts was happily sitting on the devices it had chosen, ignoring those changes.\nOnce I realized what was going on, changing the setting manually in Hangouts from my other wireless headphones to the AirPods proves effective every time.\n", "Q: Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys not working I have a MacBook Pro with touchbar and macOS 10.14.1\nI'm using a non apple docking station to which I plugged in an LMP keyboard (Model KB-1243) via USB.\nNow I want to use the function keys in IntelliJ as shortcuts without having to press the 'fn' key. So I checked the checkbox 'use F1, F2 etc. keys as standard function keys' but it's not working. I still have to press the fn key. I guess this setting is only for the internal MacBook keyboard, because there it works.\nBut how can I get it enabled for my external USB-Keyboard?\nI just tried it with the Karabiner-Elements, set the function keys to the corresponding function key. But it still doesn't work.\n\nA: I had the same issue but found a solution. You can enable/disable the feature by pressing the fn+Esc keys on the LMP keyboard. Apparently it's a feature built in the firmware and can't be adjusted with software. It took me hours to find out...  \nI tried everything first. I downloaded Fluor, Karabiner, FunctionFlip, nothing worked. Until I found that little leaflet in the box with instructions...\n\nA: Ok the problem seems to be the LMP keyboard.

(See help hash for info.)\ntype -a commandname will not show you that, only type commandname will.\nIn this case, hash -d ds9 would be all that would be needed.\n\nA: The command is apparently aliased to a broken alias. First, check for all the matches for ds9 in PATH environment variable, by executing the following command:\ntype -a ds9\nAs per your updated question, it's apparent from the output of type -a ds9 command, that an alias is shadowing the actual command.\nTo execute the actual command by ignoring the alias, and without specifying the full path, prepend a \\ (backslash) character before the command. This ignores any bash defined alias.\nIf you do not wish to prepend the backslash before the command every time, figure out where the alias is being created, and either remove it, or override the alias with the actual command.\n", "Q: iPad initial setup join Wi-Fi by scanning QR code Is it possible to configure things such that iPad gives me an option to open the Camera app to scan a QR code to connect to a Wi-Fi access point? Do note that the iPad will be enrolled into DEP and this is required during the initial setup.\n\nA: It is not possible to access the built-in Camera app before the initial setup is complete.\nAs the iPads in question will be configured via DEP, the appropriate approach would be to provision for your device to join the desired Wi-Fi access point(s) automatically via your MDM solution. When done, the iPad will automatically connect to the said Wi-Fi network if it is available, even during the initial setup.\n", "Q: Can a \"normal\" user see all processes with htop? Can I see all processes with htop or does it make sense to use sudo htop?\nI use htop in the terminal (installed via brew / homebrew). My useraccount on the macbook is a default user no special rights restrictions. OS-Version Mojave.\nhttps://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htop\n\nA: Yes, you can see all processes with htop as the default user.\nNote that if you for example use virtualization to run multiple systems on one, htop will only show you the virtualization program as a process - not the processes running within that virtual machine.\nWhether or not it makes sense to use sudo htop depends on the context. If you run htop as an ordinary user, you do not get the full information on all processes - i.e. processes started by other user's will be listed, but with incomplete numbers. If you need the full set of data about processes started by other users, sudo htop definitely makes sense.\nOn the other hand, as soon as you start htop with sudo you need to aware that you have full privileges - for example it is possible to kill system processes and programs started by other users. If this not your intention, starting htop without sudo removes the risk of doing that by mistake.\n", "Q: What is the difference between `on` and `to` in AppleScript handler declaration What is the difference between on and to in AppleScript handler declaration?

As part of the activity, I'm going to set up an old Mac (likely running Snow Leopard) with a specially-created user account. The desktop will contain an interactive, executable .command shell script that asks the kids to input a series of \"passwords\" to obtain the code to a safe.\nI'm a little concerned that some enterprising child will realize they can open the script in a text editor and just read all the passwords. Making the account boot directly to a console might help, but I'd rather not do that, and there's still a risk someone will know the nano command.\nHow can I make this script as difficult to read as possible?\n\nA: Option 1: use the shell script compiler to turn the script into a binary executable. The binary will still contain the script (in highly obscured form), but unlike a regular script, you can set the file permissions so the account the kids are using doesn't have read access to it (just execute).\nOption 2: Encrypt the safe code using the \"passwords\", store the encrypted code in the script, and use what the kids enter to decrypt it. Here's an encryption process you could use with three passwords, \"sekrit1\", \"hunter2\", and \"p4ssw0rd3\":\n$ echo '12 left, 25 right, 9 left' | openssl enc -aes256 -base64 -pass \"pass:sekrit1|hunter2|p4ssw0rd3\"\nU2FsdGVkX18IFQAaSjEv2AJJ16z6wjROjcHiqHWGvji3MEsmcHwPgu3MQeh2O+c1\n\nThen in the script:\nread -p \"Enter the first password: \" pass1\nread -p \"Enter the second password: \" pass2\nread -p \"Enter the third password: \" pass3\nencrypted=\"U2FsdGVkX18IFQAaSjEv2AJJ16z6wjROjcHiqHWGvji3MEsmcHwPgu3MQeh2O+c1\"\nif result=$(echo \"$encrypted\" | openssl enc -d -aes256 -base64 -pass \"pass:$pass1|$pass2|$pass3\" 2>/dev/null); then\n    echo \"The safe combination is $result\"\nelse\n    echo \"At least one password is wrong!\"\nfi\n\nIf you want to give the kids password-by-password feedback, you could add checking the hashes of the passwords as they're entered:\n$ echo \"sekrit1\" | shasum\nb19fb68c28bff07cf8fcc7c53ab48c5d6f41e993  -\n\nIn script:\nread -p \"Enter the first password: \" pass1\nif [ \"$(echo \"$pass1\" | shasum)\" = \"b19fb68c28bff07cf8fcc7c53ab48c5d6f41e993  -\" ]; then\n        echo \"Correct so far...\"\nelse\n        echo \"Wrong!\"\n        exit\nfi\n...etc\n\nBTW, this isn't a really secure way to store passwords; proper secure password hashes are designed to be slow and use \"salt\". But this should be secure enough for some kids.\n\nA: You could use Platypus to wrap the script up in an app which would be hard to read.\nDisclaimer: I'm a satisfied user of Platypus and have no financial or other connections with Sveinbjorn.org.\n\nA: I have ultimately decided to go with this node program which obfuscates bash scripts: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bash-obfuscate. I used pkg to turn the program into a static binary executable I will be able to run on any Mac computer. While the obfuscation isn't perfect, it should be more than enough for my young audience.\n\nGordon Davisson's answer is strong and will likely work for others who come across this question. However, I have some concerns for my specific use case. I plan to modify these \"passwords\" shortly before running the activity, so they can be tuned to my environment and audience. I need this process to be quick and not prone to errors. Thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*SHC, which compiles shell scripts to binary executables, requires that a proper dev environment with gcc be installed on the machine. I am not sure what machine I will be using when I set this up, so I want to avoid this requirement.\n\n*Modifying the script to use encrypted passwords—and encrypting the output that gets displayed once all passwords are entered—would be a manual process, and one I'd have to redo when I change the passwords. And I'd need to retest the encrypted script after every change, to make sure I didn't mess anything up.\n", "Q: Issue with app store downloading When I need to download any app from the App Store, it is directly taking me to put in my Apple ID and password to confirm the way of purchasing.  This app is free. \nPreviously, there was an option \"None\" then credit card or phone number.  Now \"None\" is not appearing and I have to purchase the app.\n\nA: There are several reasons why you can’t select none:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have unpaid balance or a payment due.\nIf this is the case you have to pay your balance until you select none.\n\nYou can't select None as your payment type until you pay your balance.

When this happens, you can't choose gift cards or store credit as your payment method. If you want to remove your payment method after you change the country or region, you can change your payment information to None.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you’re part of family sharing\n\nWhen you set up Family Sharing, the family organizer must provide a valid payment method.

Others said that there might be latency issues (like noticeable lag).\nIs there was some type of adapter or converter that I could use to make this work?\n\nA: There is a reason for the USB-C / USB 3.0 requirement, and I think it is power (among other factors).\nThe specifications of those monitors mention 7.5 and 8 Watt. If I understand the USB wiki correctly, USB 2.0 can at most give you 2.5 W (0.5A x 5V), which is not sufficient for your situation.\nSo even if you find a cable that can physically connect you MacBook to the screen, it will probably not work.\n", "Q: Cannot remove a rogue mount point A mount point /home appeared in my root directory that I cannot get rid of.

The problem arose when I was trying to run a Docker image and received an error message along the lines of there not being enough disk space available in /home to mount image data.\nFrom this response it's apparent that while /home serves no direct use to the MacOS file system (it's not referenced in the official MacOS filesystem guide), it's used to mount files when MacOS is connected to an NFS filesystem, like the one in the running Docker container. Some order of doing a clean re-install of Docker, re-mounting /home, re-pulling the Docker image, and restarting my laptop seems to have fixed the issue and my container is now running without issues.\nFor what it's worth, it is possible to permanently unmount /home, and I found a guide for doing so on this StackOverflow post, albeit for a much older MacOS version than mine.\nThanks to those who responded!\n", "Q: How to recover lost partition after diskutil erasevolume?

I want to highlight some parts of it. The highlight icon is disabled; the Tools > Annotate > Highlight Text is greyed out.\nWhy?

Then choose a color which isn't frequent inside your image, let's say Lemon and decrease the opacity to less than 25 % to be able to see the text through as in this example:\n\nIf your need is important in volume of text to highlight, you will have to use an OCR software to transfom your image into text.\n", "Q: How can I remove cmd+shift+left/right shortcut in Finder?

I'm using a Macbook Pro 15\" 2018 model. I want to use wired Internet connection with it. I've tried using 2 different USB-C hubs to accomplish this, both are USB-C to Ethernet plus some USB-A 3.0 ports (SD card reader slots on one of them). They both drained the battery life on my Mac by a lot, like roughly halved it or so even though I only used the Ethernet port on them.\nToday I also got a pure USB-C to Ethernet adapter (not a hub). It seems to not drain the battery as much as the hubs but still has the same problem. I was hoping it would be better and I'll test it some more tomorrow.\nThe thing is that without the Internet connection through a USB-C to Ethernet port the battery life is just fine. It seems that it's as good as advertised, actually, more like 10 hours or so. I haven't done a real test to see how long it actually lasts before it shuts down, but it's still significantly better. Even Wi-Fi seems to use less power than USB-C to Ethernet.\nDoes anyone know a solution to this? Are USB-C to Ethernet connections on Mac bound to drain battery? Or could it be a software issue? I've tried searching the Internet a lot for a fix but it seems like a lot of people don't even have this problem with these kinds of adapters.\nThank you so much for any help, and kindest regards.\n\nA: It might be possible that some software is using up battery power.

You only need the part up to the first shash like this: teenchat.co.jp\n\n\n*In the Terminal window type 127.0.0.1 teenchat.co.jp\n\n\n127.0.0.1 refers to \"localhost\" or the computer you are currently on which does not have a web server on it followed by a space and the host name/URL of the web site you want to block\n\n\n*Continue adding entries just like this, 127.0.0.1, a space then the host name/URL of the site you want to block. Each one on a new line.\n\n*When you have entered all the sites you want to block hold ControlO and it will prompt for the fie to write out, just hit Return then ControlX to exit.\n\n\nThe words at the bottom indicate those commands and others with the Carat ^ symbol indicating the Control key.\n\n\n*Once Nano has saved your hosts file and exited, reboot your Mac. Those sites should now give you errors when you go to them.\n\n\nIf your child has an admin password he can easily undo this as the password you enter when you type any command starting with \"sudo\" will be the password of the current user. If that user is not an admin it won't work.\n\nA: To add to @Steve Chambers answer, it's important to know that this will only catch the explicitly listed site. In other words if you list facebook.com this will not block www.facebook.com or ww1.facebook.com. You must list each subdomain you want to block individually. Unfortunately, the hosts file doesn't support wildcards, so entries like *.facebook.com won't work. Also, you can chain entries on one row, so this is allowable:\n127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com ww1.facebook.com www.facebook.net\n\n\nA: The only way I can think of to do this (without enabling parental controls or using a 3rd party app) would be to edit the hosts file. See here for more info.\n", "Q: Using external microphone disables internal speaker I have a Mid-2015 Macbook Pro, which has the combined headphone/microphone jack.\nI normally use it in clamshell mode, and in the past some people have had a hard time hearing me if I try to use the built-in microphone, so I got an external microphone. I was just testing it, and discovered that when I plug it in, the Mac thinks I also have headphones plugged in, and disables the internal speaker.\nWhen I go into Sound Preferences, \"Internal Speakers\" is replaced with \"Headphones\" whenever I plug in the microphone. I guess it thinks my microphone is actually a headset with both microphone and headphones.\nIs there any way to disabuse it of this notion, and enable the internal speaker while using the external mic?\n\nA: Since I posted this question, I got a new external monitor that connects to the DisplayPort (Acer EB321HQU). It has its own speaker, so the Sound menu allows me to choose between Internal Speakers and the monitor.\nWhen I plug in the microphone, the Internal Speakers choice changes to Headphone, so it still disables the built-in speakers. But the option to use the monitor as the output device is still available. So I can select that and get audio without a headphone. Plugging in the microphone automatically changes the selection from the monitor to Headphone, but I can easily switch it.\nThis solution won't work more generally, it's only for configurations with a monitor that can be used as a sound output device.\n", "Q: MacBook booting to black screen I am currently unable to boot my Late 2013 MacBook Pro. When I attempt to boot, the backlight comes on, but there is no image on the screen.\nWhen I try to boot into Safe Mode (by holding Shift), Recovery Mode (by holding Command + R), I see neither a backlight nor an image.\nI have tried to use every resource available.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting SMC. \n\n*Resetting NVRAM. \n\n*Safe mode boot (no backlight, black screen).\n\n*Recovery mode boot (no backlight, black screen).\n\n*Verbose mode (backlight, but no image).\n\n*Boot off alternative USB (backlight, but no image to choose device).\n\n*Opened the laptop hardware and checked the display cable connection\nI was using my laptop one day, closed the lid, and when I opened it, this was this issue.\nI do tinker with Linux on an alternate partition, but I didn’t do anything in particular prior to this issue. I thought maybe the boot loader got messed up, but I can’t even boot into recovery mode on the macOS partition. \nCan anyone make a conjecture as to the cause, and/or help provide me with some debugging tips?\n\nA: The fact that the back-light worked, but the display did not indicated the problem was with the display, not the logic board. Furthermore, the fact that I was able to project the display onto an external monitor validated that it was a connection issue between the board and the display.\nI ordered a $10 USD LVDS cable, replaced it, and the computer now works :)\npart in question:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Display-Cable-MacBook-Unibody-A1278/dp/B01N2T3CFD\n\nA: From your query, it's apparent that the MacBook display has gone kaput. Your options are either to get the display serviced, or to use it with an external display.\nService/Screen replacement will be costly, as you are way past any warranty coverage/Apple Care. If you feel it's worth the money to get it inspected and fixed, that's the way to go.\nAlternative, you can use it with an external display connected all the time (preferably in Clamshell mode).\n", "Q: Difficulties Reinstalling Windows on bootcamp with APFS I installed bootcamp a few years ago and now Windows is pretty hosed so I want to do a fresh install.

I had my MacBook Pro (four USB-C ports & touch bar) connected to my LG UltraFine 5K monitor (official model name: LG 27MD5KA‑B). At the end of my day's work I turned everything off. In the morning I turned everything back on but nothing seemed to work.\nI proceeded to disconnect the monitor from the MBP and there the latter turned on without problem. I tried hot-plugging back the monitor and the MBP's screen turned black. Event the touch bar was unresponsive. So I tried all sorts of combinations in order to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the MBP, and unplug everything from the mains, wait a moment and reconnect everything;\n\n*MBP PRAM reset;\n\n*MBP SMC reset;\n\n*Removed all connected peripherals (either directly to the MBP and/or to the monitor);\n\n*Tried all the USB-C ports of the MBP;\n\n*Tried with another touch bar MBP;\n\n\nOne thing that half works is when the LG UltraFine 5K is connected to the mains and I hook an MBP with the lid close. In this case the monitor lits up, although very dimly, I can see the Apple logo and then suddenly the logo is spread horizontally across the screen and lower quarter of the screen is garbled (everything very faint). If I open the lid, only the caps lock seems to work (hinting that the computer has not crashed). If I unhook the MPB it responds without problems after a few seconds. Reconnecting it and the MBP screen turns black and the computer becomes unresponsive (apart from caps lock). I can, however, access the computer through remote login (SSH) and managed to shut it down or restart it from there (sudo shutdown -h now or sudo shutdown -r now).\nI even downloaded the LG Screen Manager, but the app seems totally useless in my case (event the copyright notice seems strange showing \"Copyright 2016-2026 LG Electronics Inc.\").\nAny suggestions on what to do next (apart from bringing the apparatus for repair)?\n\nSystem used:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP (13\", 2017, 4 thunderbolt-3 ports, Intel Core i5 @ 3.1 GHz, 8GB RAM, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB);\n\n*MBP (13\", 2017, 4 thunderbolt-3 ports, Intel Core i7 @ 3.5 GHz, 16GB RAM, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB);\n\n*Both MBP are installed with macOS Mojave Version 10.14.2\n\n*LG UltraFine 5K (aka 27MD5KA‑B);\n\n\nA: It sounds weird but anothet thing to try is if you have the Macbook touching the LG5K display in any way it causes some sort of earthing issue.  As you know the Macbook aluminium case is a conductor and there are minute amounts of current generated on the shell by the Macbook Pro itself.  If these currents find their way to the LG5K display it causes erratic behaviour (display turns off for a second or two) or wavy lines.\nAlso pls be aware not all Type-C's are the same - a Type C1 (TH3 mode) passes a 5K display signal whereas a Type C2 (USB3.1) does not.\n", "Q: Stolen iPhone - Activation Lock email I got my iPhone 6 stolen in Brazil a few weeks ago. It had a pass-code and 2 factor authentication.\nUnfortunately the pass-code was set to only be required every 4 hours so if the thief kept the phone unlocked every now and again we could assume he/she has access to it. The phone was also in air-plane mode when it was stolen.\nI immediately used a friends phone to access my iCloud and set up the \"erase\" option when the phone connected to the internet. I changed my apple password and informed my network provider.\nI just got an email saying that \"Activation Lock is requesting your password\". On iCloud it still stated \"erase pending\" and that it will happen when the phone next connects to the internet. \nSurely the activation lock request means the iPhone had to connect to the internet?? Why didn't it start erasing itself??\nI've now changed it to lost mode to see if that does anything but it says \"lost mode pending\" and it will activate when the iPhone is connected to the internet.\nI was just wondering how i got the activation lock email? And for a stolen iPhone, which mode is best... erase mode or lost mode??\n\nA: I would take extreme care not to enter your current or former Apple-ID passwords anywhere when following any kinds of directions from emails. The email you have received might well be a fake email sent by the people holding your phone, trying to trick you into giving them your Apple-ID password.\nIn general, they can do very little with a phone that has been activation locked. However if the phone is unlocked, they can find your e-email address and try to scam you into giving them the code. \nDepending on their technical abilities, they might also have put the phone on a restricted network, where the commands to erase it cannot reach it, but where it can reach other destinations on the Internet. \n\nA: \nI just got an email saying that \"Activation Lock is requesting your password\". On iCloud it still stated \"erase pending\" and that it will happen when the phone next connects to the internet.\n\nThe email could have been a scam if the iPhone was unlocked as they could have viewed your email. After you submitted the erase iPhone request.\nThe iPhone needs to have internet to receive the command to erase itself and if it is still in airplane mode it can't receive it. You got the email as when you submitted the request I assume you were connected to the internet.\n\nI've now changed it to lost mode to see if that does anything but it says \"lost mode pending\" and it will activate when the iPhone is connected to the internet.\n\nThis is most likely the same scenario, it is in airplane mode and can't receive the command.\n\nI was just wondering how i got the activation lock email? And for a stolen iPhone, which mode is best... erase mode or lost mode??\n\nLost mode is best as you can display an alternative phone number where people can contact if they find your phone.\n\nIf you ever misplace your device—whether it’s lost or you think it might have been stolen—you should put it into Lost Mode immediately with Find My iPhone.\nLost Mode locks your screen with a passcode and lets you display a custom message with your phone number to help you get it back. You can also remotely erase your device if needed, and your custom message continues to display even after the device is erased.\nWhile Activation Lock works in the background to make it more difficult for someone to use or sell your missing device, Lost Mode clearly indicates to anyone who finds your device that it still belongs to you and can’t be reactivated without your password.\n\n\nA: This is what Activation Lock does. \nThe thief has to sign in w your credentials in order to open & use your iPhone. \nAs you see ...you have to leave it on and make yr iPhone useless. \n", "Q: Identify hard drive in Time Capsule I have Time Capsule of the 1st generation (the flat one) wherein I changed the hard drive for one with 3TB capacity.

Now both users can read it and even write to it ....... once. After the file has been written, the file permissions reset so that the other user account can't read nor write.

My corporate MacBook Pro has a specific hostname, so when I connect to the headphones I hear a really long, random alphanumeric string.\nIf I was able to change the Computer name in the Sharing preferences pane it will rename the Bluetooth name, but is there a way to rename the bluetooth name only, leaving the computer name and network hostname alone?\n\nA: Had the same problem, this worked for me:\nYou can rename the LocalHostName separately from the Computer Name, which should give you the desired result, and shouldn't mess with any network settings. \nUnder System Preferences -> Sharing, click the Edit button to the lower right of the Computer Name field. Here you can enter a different local hostname, and leave the computer name set to whatever you want the Bluetooth name to be. \nIf you explicitly need to set a hostname, you can also do that from Terminal, by entering: \nscutil --set HostName yourhostnamehere\n\nBefore you do that though, you might want to check the current values. You can use these commands for hostname, local hostname, and computer name respectively:\nscutil --get HostName\nscutil --get LocalHostName\nscutil --get ComputerName\n\nAn explanation of each of the properties can be found here:\nComputerName is the so-called “user-friendly” computer name for a Mac, it’s what will show up on the Mac itself and what will be visible to others when connecting to it over a local network. This is also what’s visible under the Sharing preference panel.\nHostName is the name assigned to the computer as visible from the command line, and it’s also used by local and remote networks when connecting through SSH and Remote Login.\nLocalHostName is the name identifier used by Bonjour and visible through file sharing services like AirDrop\n", "Q: Macbook with thunderbolt 3 and disk drive? I thought I just saw someone with (what I believe to be) a thunderbolt 3 and a disc drive on their MacBook, and I thought there were no more disc drives that were built into MacBooks (that have thunderbolt 3 ports also).

Office 2016 has on option in the Windows version to alter the export-DPI of PowerPoint by editing a registry key,\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\PowerPoint\\Options\n\nWhere would I find this registry key or the equivalent on the OSX version?\n\nA: Assuming I understand your question correctly, you can change the DPI by altering the width and height upon export.\nFor example, if you want to export your slides in PNG format, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to File > Export...\n\n*In the Export window that appears, select the PNG option from the File Format drop-down list (at bottom centre of window)\n\n*Now you will see options for Width and Height (see image below):\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now change the value of either option (this will automatically change the other value to ensure you keep the same ratio)\n\n\nBy changing the dimensions, you also change the DPI. For example, a 720x405 image exported from PowerPoint will only be about 54dpi, while doubling this upon export to 1,440x810 will also double the dpi to 108dpi.\n\nA: The functional equivalent of registry key on Windows are users defaults on MacOS X.\nThese users defaults can be managed through the defaults command.\nTo find if there exist the wanted function within the MacOS X version of PowerPoint you will have to open a Terminal and type exactly:\ndefaults read com.microsoft.PowerPoint\n\nwhich will give the complete list of tunable functions accessible within PowerPoint.\nFrom the correct definition of the function you are looking for, you should be able to find which one of these settings has to be changed.\nAnd then you will be able to change it with a command like:\ndefaults write com.microsoft.PowerPoint variable 'value'\n\nTo get an in depth explanation of this command defaults type:\nman defaults\n\n", "Q: How can I tell that a certificate is a root certificate? \nAre these certificates root certificates or not and how can I disable them if they are?\n\nA: You may want to refer to Lists of available trusted root certificates in iOS on Apple's website.

I recently upgraded to Mojave from 10.9.  The app store shows an old Apple id as the \"owner\" of iMovie and I cannot update my version of iMovie without a password I don't know.  My old version of iMovie works on Mojave and did on Mavericks however.  I don't remember paying for iMovie. The App Store reports Apr 2014 as the last update.\nHow do I update iMovie now that I'm running macOS Mojave and using a different Apple ID?\n\nA: iMovie and the other iLife apps used to be paid-for except with a new Mac, and when the App Store was introduced, it registered the Mac's serial number with your App Store account to allow you to download iMovie etc. for free.\nThese days, these apps are actually free anyway. The problem in your case is that you still have the old binary around, and this contains the App Store receipt with  your old App Store Apple ID.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a backup of the iMovie app just to be sure, (e.g. Time Machine, or just copy the app to an external HDD or USB stick)\n\n*Then quit the App Store app if it's running and delete iMovie from the Applications folder.\n\n*Eject any external media that have the iMovie app on as well, so the App Store app can't find any existing copies to update.\n\n*Open the App Store, make sure you're logged in with your correct Apple ID.\n\n*Find iMovie in the store (just search for it), and hit \"Get\". This will redownload the latest version of iMovie for free, using your new Apple ID.\n\n\nStep 3 is crucial, if the App Store can find an existing copy of the app it will try to update it again, running into the same problem as before.\n", "Q: How to mount an APFS volume as a user's home directory? TLDR;\nI can mount an APFS volume on /Users/foobar, where foobar is not an actual user, but mounting fails when trying to mount to /Users/newuser, when newuser is an actual user.\nBACKGROUND:\nI'm trying put my home directory on an encrypted external SSD so that I don't have to use filevault on my boot drive-- I need the machine to boot up and autologin so server processes can start up after a power failure. All the gritty details on what I'm trying to do are in this gist, but I will try to discuss the essential points below.\nBefore actually trying to move my own home folder, I created a Standard user called newuser to experiment with. I removed /Users/newuser and replaced it with a new empty folder. I also created a /Users/foobar folder (no foobar user). When I try to mount either with \nsudo diskutil mount\n\nor\nsudo mount_apfs\n\nI get errors when trying to mount on /Users/newuser but both commands work with /Users/foobar. Both directories are empty, have the same Unix permissions and ownership, have no ACLs, flags or extended attributes. /Users also appears to have no special properties that are visible to ls.\nI also tried mounting on /home instead /Users as suggested here, and when I first created the /home/newusers directory I was able to mount on it, UNTIL I changed newuser's home directory in the Users & Groups Preference Pane. Once it became the official home directory I could no longer mount.\nEvidently something in the system (Mojave 10.14.2) is refusing to mount over a user's home folder. \nIs there any way around this?\n(I just saw a recent question dealing with this but didn't see any new ideas to try)\n\nA: I found the workaround was to mount the volume on /home and create a subdirectory as my new home directory. As\nsudo mount_apfs -o noauto,nobrowse VOLUME_UUID /home\nsudo rsync -a /Users/myhome /home\n\nThen change the user's home directory in User & Groups Preference Pane Advanced Options to /home/myhome\nI have updated my gist with the complete instructions for mounting an encrypted external drive as a home directory.\nUPDATE: After using this for a while I discovered problems with backup software. Notably, Backblaze will not backup custom mount points, and Time Machine will back it up, but the volume is not visible in the restore GUI. In fact, it confusingly displays localsnapshots of the files \"underneath\" the mount point in /home. \nSo I caved and just decided to mount the thing in the default /Volumes. I works swimmingly and the gist has all the details.\nOh and by the way, I used Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the home directory. I recommend using that or equivalent (SuperDuper) as opposed to rsync as the developers of these apps are up-to-date on how to copy all the myriad Apple file attributes, extended attributes, ACLs, flags, etc., etc.\n", "Q: External (Thunderbolt 2) drive keeps changing to read-only randomly I'm running macOS 10.14.2 on a 2018 Mac mini.

I'm not really sure where to begin troubleshooting this. This also happened on my 2013 Mac Pro running High Sierra.\n\nA: I assume you've already done this, but I would check my connectors.  Additionally, the one drive may not be getting as much power and/or can be beginning to fail.

As the title suggests, my 2 iPads have the same login, the same iCloud backup, but the contacts list on both is different. \nIs there a way I can merge the two so they're synced?\nMy old iPad has most of the contacts I want, the new one has newer ones which weren't in the old one, so don't really want to lose either set!\n\nA: Are both iPads synchronized to the same email accounts?  FOr example, my iPhone only Gmail access but my iPad Pro has access to multiple Gmail and Hotmail accounts.  This could account for the variation.  The only way I know to fix mismatched contact lists is to either export one and merge it into the other one.  I'm not sure how easily this would be on an iPad, but if you can send them both to a Gmail account, Gmail has the ability to detect/merge duplicates, etc.\n\nA: The contact lists are a combination of multiple storage types. They can contain iCloud contacts as well as other accounts and local entries.\n", "Q: displays - drive displays from USB-C hub Is it possible to drive a monitor from a hub? If the hub was Thunderbolt 3 compatible and I used a USB-C to HDMI adapter, from the hub to the monitor, would this work? The monitor in question is a Full HD (1080p@60Hz) monitor - nothing crazy.\nI ask this question as I'm currently looking at a USB-C to 3 HDMI adapter however the price is pretty high - and I'm looking for a workaround. It seems that individual USB-C to HDMI cables are a lot cheaper.\n\nA: This is can work, however, it depends on your personal equipment.  Both my motherboard's onboard video and my Geforce RTX 2080 Ti have the ability to do what you are asking.\nFor example, the \"Anker USB C Hub\" has the HDMI port built in, as well as USB and an Ethernet port.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to drive a monitor from a hub?\n\nYes.  Thunderbolt hub options were slim to none for a long time, I'm seeing them come to market now though.  Here's an example, not an endorsement:\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-hub\nThe problem with a Thunder bolt hub is that until USB4 the operation of a USB-C hub was not defined.  Someone could make a Thunderbolt-only hub with USB-C ports but then face all kinds of support problems as people try to use them with their USB-only devices.  With the USB4 spec they filled in the parts on how a USB-C hub works and so manufacturers are confident that they can produce USB compliant hubs.\nThe product description leaves out what kind of displays can be connected.  It may require Thunderbolt displays or allow DisplayPort.  If DisplayPort works then common inexpensive USB-C/DP to HDMI (or VGA, or whatever) should work also.  If only Thunderbolt is allowed then HDMI (or whatever) can be used with a Thunderbolt GPU, also common but not so inexpensive.\nI know this is a couple years old but I post anyway given that there's a new development.\n", "Q: Is there a way to reroute files downloaded from a specific domain to a new folder?

I'm unsure of their specific implementation and was hoping for some insight and/or help in putting something together.\nI currently use Firefox and they used to have an extension that would reroute files based on whatever given rules. This is not the case after the release of Quantum. \n\nA: I haven't used it myself, but I've heard good things about Hazel.

So I decided to delete it.\nI did my best to remove Windows by using the Disk Utility to delete the partition, but problems arose when the Mac would restart. The Mac would automatically boot into recovery mode in Windows. I would have to shut the computer down, then power up while holding down the optionkey until I could select the Mac Drive. I researched a bit more and found this could be fixed by mounting the EFI volume on /dev/disk0s1 and deleting the Windows and Boot folders inside the EFI folder.

I recently created an SSH public/private keypair on my Mac OSX Yosemite system and for this use-case, I wanted to encrypt the private key with a passphrase.\nHowever, the first time I attempted to use this key, I was surprised to see a GUI component overlay itself over my terminal ... that is the first time I had ever seen (or heard of) keychain.\nI want nothing to do with this.  I want the passphrase to exist nowhere but my own head - not even in an encrypted or keychain-vaulted safe space.\nSo I learned about the ssh config option 'AskPassGUI no' and that seems to have solved my problem.  I use that ssh key and keychain seems to not be invoked and there are no GUI pop-ups, etc.\nBut I'm suspicious ... I never liked that little Unicode key character that the Mac terminal inserts into the passphrase dialog in the terminal - it makes me think there are processes or services overlaying the terminal.\nMy question:\nWith AskPassGUI set to no, and no sign of keychain popping up, am I saving/caching/storing either my key, or my passphrase ... or anything ... inside OSX ?\nOr am I having the simple, basic, text only relationship with my terminal that I hope to be having ?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have no inside information about the MacOS internals, but from my experience using this feature, the passphrase is accepted by the GUI only to add the corresponding key to an ssh-agent. On my system it did not store the passphrase in the keychain (which I also do not want), but I'm not sure that's default behavior. My terminal would report \"saving to keychain failed\", but I could then ssh using that key until I logged out / restarted.\nSee the \"AskPassGUI\" and \"KeychainIntegration\" options in ssh_config (superseded in more recent MacOS versions, though).\nBecause it did not save the passphrase in the keychain, I happily entered my passphrase only once a week (shutting down on the weekend and never logging out).\n", "Q: Changing to a different WiFi connection I'm using MacBook Air running MacOS Sierra and using an IP address(provided by my college) that has been bound to my device's MAC address manually.\nie- My device's MAC address is has been bonded with a specific IP address provided by the College's network administrators.\nSo, I've manually configured the network connection with that specific IP address.\n\nNow, when I connect to my phone's wi-fi (Redmi 4A), it gets connected (DHCP), the internet works well and after 2-3 minutes the internet finally disconnects even though I'm still connected to my phone's wi-fi. \nIs this due to the manual network settings set only for the IP address provided by the college. \nEDIT: :\nI found that the manual setting for the college wifi is causing a problem. When connecting to phone's wifi, the Using DHCP option doesn't get automatically selected.\nSo, what I did is that when connecting to my phone's wifi, I selected the Using DHCP and it worked well.\nBut the problem now is that when I reconnect to my college wifi, the Configure IPv4 now shows Using DHCP which I had previously selected when connecting to my phone's wifi.\nHence, when connecting to the college wifi, all the manual settings have disappeared and I have to fill the configuration details again.\nPlease suggest some workaround to deal with the above problem. I don't want to reconfigure all the manual settings again and again when I switch between the 2 wifis.\n\nA: To connect to your phones hotspot you will need to set Configure IPv4 to Use DHCP.\nTo have different network settings for the same interface you can set up network locations. For instance, add a new location for college with the IPv4 settings you've specified, and when you're using your phones hotspot or somewhere that doesn't require manual setup, use the default Automatic location.\n\nA: You have (at least) two different network configurations, here one for your college on Wi-Fi with a manual IP address, another one through your phone Wi-Fi with a DHCP attributed IP address.\nYou can't achieve this with the default Automatic \"Location\" (this is the vocabulary of Apple, because a network configuration is often associated with a physical location, but the term is misleading, in fact we are dealing here with a \"network configuration\").\nYou will have to create 2 different \"locations\":\n\n\n*\n\n*One named College or better College / Wi-Fi with the manual IP configuration provided by your college,\n\n*One named My phone or better My phone / Wi-Fi with the dynamical attribution of your IP address with DHCP.\n\n\nOnce you have created the second network configuration a new menu entry will appear within your  menu: Location with a sub-menu which will let you switch from one network configuration to the other.\nI even advise to suppress the Automatic network configuration (or location if you prefer to stick to the Apple vocabulary) because it is making too many things magically and when one needs to trouble shoot network problems, the magical features are a real nightmare.\n", "Q: Determine com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles status using command line?

As per usual, I typed \"csrutil disable\", and 'command not found' was returned. I looked at klanomath's answer here (csrutil: command not found) though I didn't quite understand what he/she meant by 'booting to your main volume'. I am not sure if that is relevant here, but I am inquiring if there is any further way to disable SIP. Is high-sierra needed or helpful here? \n(Also, if possible, an answer comprehensible by someone with very little background in computing or working with the terminal would be highly appreciated)\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Instead of just writing \"csrutil\", replace that with:\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/csrutil\n\nso the whole thing becomes:\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/csrutil disable\n\nNote that \"Macintosh HD\" should be replaced with the name of your startup disk. If you do not know the name, then run the following command:\nls /Volumes\n\nIt will list the available volumes for you.\nIf the above gives the error message: \"Operation not supported\" it means that your recovery system is a version so old that it hasn't got support for the functionality necessary to run csrutil.\nIn that case try starting up in Internet Recovery mode by holding down Cmd-Opt-R while booting the Mac, which means that the files for the recovery system are downloaded adhoc from Apple's servers. This should give you a version new enough to run csrutil. \nIn case that is not possible then you could instead upgrade your own recovery partition to a newer version or alternatively create a recovery partition on a USB pen-drive and boot on that.

Indexing is turned on and I already tried re-indexing.\nThis is on High Sierra 10.13.6.\nUpdate\nIt happened only with a handful of 3rd party apps so far. A pattern emerged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update an app which replaces an existing .app (i.e. same name) → Spotlight shows the OLD version as per \"Version: xyz\", I guess that's the reason it won't start\n\n*Update an app where the new version's .app has a different name e.g. rebranding and delete the old .app → Spotlight shows the old AND the new version, the new one can be started\n\n\nA: I ran the following commands (again) yesterday and they didn't seem to fix the issue\nsudo mdutil -i off /\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100\nsudo mdutil -i on /\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nThen this morning macOS wanted to install some updates* and everything is back to normal now.\n* a Safari update asked me to terminate \"Spotlight.app\" first, I found that odd because the only way to do this (to my knowledge) is through CLI or Activity Monitor\n", "Q: Unable to format sandisk ultra 16gb usb3.0 pendrive in mac I have been using Sandisk Ultra usb 3.0 pen drive since Jan, 2016. I live in Mumbai. But previous month, I created bootable usb with mac os Mojave. Then I formatted pen drive. Dont know what happened, since then the pen drive is not appearing on the desktop screen. In the disk utility, the pendrive is showing but its main partition is faded out. In the info box, it is showing,  Mount Point: Not Mounted. I ran first aid, it is showing good condition. Then I clicked on mount in the diskutility selecting the faded out partition, nothing happened. \nwhen the faded out partition of the pendrive selected, I tried to erase with mac os journaled, it says, can not create file system on /dev/disk1s2 and below it, it was written 'permission denied' and at the bottom, it was written, file formatter failed. \nI tried to erase the disk with erase disk but no result, some error message is appearing. \nIf I try to format in windows 10 then error message says the disk is write protected. \nNote: Currently I am using mac os x, El capitan IMAC.\nPlease look into the picture for more details. \nPlease guide me to get back the pen drive functioning properly. Thanks in advance. \n\nA: Your USB stick may be defective.\n\nHow do I fix a Write Protect error?\nWrite protection errors occur when a flash drive detects a potential\n  fault within itself. The drive will go into write-protected mode to\n  prevent data loss. There is no method to fix this. To verify the issue\n  is related to the flash drive and not your computer we recommend that\n  you try plugging the USB drive into another port on your computer. You\n  should also try the drive on another computer if possible.\n\nSource: https://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8656/~/write-protect-error-on-usb-flash-drives\n", "Q: New MacBook Pro has a battery cycle count of 2 I bought a new 2017 MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar. I found that it had 2 charge cycles.\nIs this normal for a new MacBook Pro or it is used?\n\nA: To me this value looks completely normal. Apple needs to use the battery for quality testing.\n\nThat represents the results of testing during build and Quality Testing.\n\n(Source)\nA used MacBook will have well over 2 battery cycles.\n\nA: How can you tell if your MacBook is new or used?\nCycle count on a battery can't tell you if your Mac was new or used.  Why?\n\n*\n\n*You could have a new top case (new battery)\n\n*It could have been plugged in (i.e a \"demo model\") and never allowed the battery to fully discharge\n\nIn both of the above scenarios, you would have a low cycle count, but actually have used equipment.\nAdditionally, a 2017 MacBook Pro is the previous years model (as of this answer), so it's entirely possible you have something called NOS or New Old Stock.  Battery charge levels will drop, so to make the unboxing experience a positive one, retailers will often times remove the device to charge it up and re-shrink wrap it.\nAlso, looking up the serial number is not a definitive way to see if the unit is used or not.  The SN# database is updated upon registration of the device.  If the Mac is never registered nor signed in with an AppleID, it won't show in a SN# lookup.\nAt best, these are indicators, but they are not definitive.\nIt's important to note that you can have a new product actually contain components that came from an previously opened/used item.  In this answer I reference an FTC opinion on a Sony case involving the recommissioning of previously owned products as new (spoiler:  it's legal).\nSo, how can you tell if the Mac you are buying is new or used?\n\n*\n\n*Buy from a reputable source.  Scams do happen, but there is a level of protection when buying from reputable sources.  Buying directly from Apple or a retailer you trust goes a long way in ensuring you get what was advertised.\n\n\n*Physically inspect the item.  Does it have that \"new tech unboxing experience?\"  Does the plastic protective film look factory applied?  Do the cables and boxes look properly sealed, coiled, and secured?\n\n\n*Boot the machine.  Do you get that new user \"Welcome\" experience or does it look like an account was created?\n\n\n*When in doubt, return it!  You paid good money for a laptop.  If you feel that it's not what you are expecting and you have lingering doubts - return it for exchange or refund.\nTL;DR\nTwo charge cycles on a new MacBook that's technically 1 year old is perfectly fine.  Unless you have something else that's jumping out at you that this is a used device; in all likelihood, your device is brand new.\n\nA: The maximum count of your unit is 1000. 2 is normal for new unit. You have 998 cycle count before you reach the maximum cycle count. Once you reach it you need to replace the battery.\n", "Q: Copy entire user profile to new device with different username My work MBP has been set up as a standalone device, but now needs to join the corporate network.\nIs there a way to copy my entire user profile (apps, config, terminal settings etc) to a new device (the same device, having been wiped) with a different username? (e.g. domain\\dunc)\nThe new user account will already be created on the \"new\" device, and I don't have the ability to change this.\n\nA: I have done the same thing a number of time for the same reasons. \nIn what follows I assume you are running macOS High Sierra or later. If that were not the case, some paths and preference pane options might be different.\nWhat I have found is that using the same Apple ID on both the old and the new machine/install already goes a long way. Just make sure to select Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari, Notes and especially Keychains in System Preferences/iCloud on both machines. If desired you can enable the other items as well like iCLoud Drive, Photos etc.\nThis way you will be able to migrate your passwords, Safari bookmarks & history etc. Using the same Apple ID you will be able to re-download all apps you bought from the App Store as well.\nIf you are using Dropbox or similar, install those as well on the new machine/install. This way any file stored there will be available on the new box as well.\nWhat's still missing is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documents (the ones not in iCloud Drive, Dropbox etc.)\n\n*Preferences\n\n*SSH keys\n\n*Any app not bought from the App Store\n\n*Any system-wide extension, VPN profile and the like.\n\n\nTo bring those over, what I suggest is the following. Log onto your old machine/install and backup (to an external drive or USB stick):\n\n\n*\n\n*Your home directory (/Users/\"username\")\n\n*/Library\n\n*/Users/Shared (if not empty)\n\n\nA Time Machine backup would be more complete and definitely preferable.\nOn the new machine/install, under your new account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install your old apps (re-download them if necessary).\n\n*Copy the directories Application Support, Fonts and Preferences from  \"your old home directory\"/Library/ to \"your new home directory\"/Library/\n\n*Do the same with any app-specific directory you find there.\n\n*Display hidden files in your old home directory using the Finder (Command + Shift + .) and copy .ssh, .local and any app specific files and directories over (e.g. .vim/ and .vimrc).\n\n*Copy the content of the old /Users/Shared to the new machine.\n\n*Copy any file or directory over from the old /Library folder to the new one. This typically involves looking inside Application Support, Extensions and Fonts in there.\n\n\nApplication-secific configs are typically stored in your home directory, inside Library/Preferences and/or Library/Application Support. To copy those over you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the whole Library/Preferences and Library/Application Support directories from your old home to the new account.\n\n*Selectively copy the files and directories from those two locations over to the new account.\n\n\nMy preferences is for the latter option as I like to keep things clean.\nSome notes and warnings: messing with /Users/Shared and especially /Library/Extensions is not usually necessary. Please do it only if you know what you are doing as you could mess up your new machine.\nFor the next time, you might want to look into automating the setup of a new macOS machine. There are a number of ways to do that. One I use if having your own dotfiles.\nMost of the files you will be copying over using the procedure outlined above are not tied to your username. There are a handful of exceptions however (mostly your shell config and history). \nIf you are familiar with the Terminal you can use grep to find them (e.g. find $HOME -exec grep $USER {} \\; -print on the old machine when logged in as your old account).\nFinally, the list above is probably not complete. However you should be able to adapt it to cover your needs.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Migration Assistant is built for situations just like this. It will give you the option to transfer over just one specific user. Here's Apple's article on it which is fairly comprehensive.\nMigration Assistant probably won't give you the option to rename your username though. Fortunately it's not too hard - here's a guide on it.. Make sure that you're logged out when you do these steps & that you change both the username & the home folder. If you only change one there's a good chance you won't be able to log into that account again.\n", "Q: Remote Desktop 10.2.3 Database Creation Error; 10.2.1 runs fine; 10.2.2 crashes: how to find actual cause(s)?

A few days ago I got a message on my Mac that my Apple account was locked and I had to change my password. I did that, but ever since then, using Apple products has become a nightmare. I have Mac, iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, I'm signed in all of these devices and they are synced via iCloud.\nAll devices are asking for password multiple times a day, applications also synced via iCloud (for example Notability) can't sync because they detect iCloud not available. Multiple restart happened, I deleted local files, I deleted caches and still not working as it did a few days ago. Why on earth I have to enter multiple times my password on a device when I assume it should be enough (I assume an auth server should be able to serve all auth related requests centrally) only once?\nDoes Apple lock user accounts frequently and force users to change passwords? If not, then is possible to get some info why they did it in my case?\nMy account has had this password for a few months, or half a year. It is in use on daily basis for work.\n\nA: You mentioned that \"all devices are asking for password multiple times a day...\"\nApple describes the type of message you could possibly receive in their support document If your Apple ID is locked or disabled\n\nIf you or someone else enters your password, security questions, or\n  other account information incorrectly too many times, your Apple ID\n  automatically locks to protect your security and you can't sign in to\n  any Apple services. You can unlock your Apple ID after you verify your\n  identity.\n\nIf this was a legitimate security concern (which I believe it could very well be), you need to reset (change) your password and even enable two factor authentication.\nNow, bear in mind that there are AppleID phishing scams that will tell you that you're account is locked and then provide you a link on which to confirm your account details.  If you clicked on this, you gave away your account info.  Reset it as soon as possible.\nNote:  Legitimate firms (banks, Apple, Facebook, etc.) will never send you a link to validate or sign in.

My MacBook no longer has an INTERNAL hard drive listed, and it is not the kind where the battery can be removed from the back. I need to know if there is any way to make one before I take it to the shop.\n\nA: If disk utility does not show your internal disk anymore it is a Hardware, not a Software fault. Unless you are savvy enough to troubleshoot the hardware issue yourself you will have to take it to a repair center. \nMost likely it is actually not the Hard Drive but the Hard Drive cable that is failing.

I have the sender address in my Contacts, and in Mail's Junk Mail preferences I have the box \"Sender of message is in my Contacts\" checked. Yet this doesn't seem to be working, they're still being filtered. The site is an online forum, and it emails new postings in threads I've subscribed to.\nI also had the option \"Perform custom actions\" selected. I think this may have been left over from years ago when I was also using a third-party spam filtering plugin. When I look in the \"Advanced...\" page, the conditions are equivalent to all the checkboxes on the main screen. I tried changing that option to \"Move it to the Junk mailbox\", but this actually made things worse -- instead of just a couple of the messages being moved to Junk, almost all of them were -- so I put it back.\nI haven't figured out what might be distinguishing the messages that are being marked as junk.\nAny idea why that option isn't really exempting them from junk filtering?\nEDIT:\nIn case it's relevant, I also have a rule that matches these messages; it matched the sender and subject line. It was just marking them as read (I have a menulet that shows the number of unread messages, and I don't want these included). When the messages were put in Junk, they were still marked as unread, so this must be happening before rule processing. I tried changing the filter to move them to a new folder, it didn't help.\n\nA: This turned out to be spam filtering by the ISP (Comcast), not Mail.app. Since they use IMAP, the ISP's Junk folder is sync'ed with the Mac's Junk folder, so when the ISP filters it it looks just like the client filtering it.\nI went to the ISP's mail settings and disabled their spam filter, and the problem went away.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of Mark as a Company on Mac Contacts?

Does this affect any practical usages, other than an implicit type which cannot be used as a filter or key in Smart Groups? Thanks!\n\nA: Two reasons:\nFirstly, it's so the contact displays the company name when you receive a call instead of a personal name. \nSecondly, it also sorts it in alphabetical order into your contacts by company name and not by a personal name. This is especially useful as contacts are sorted alphabetically by surname and not by first name, ie. Tim Cook is listed under \"C\" in your contacts but if you were to have \"Apple Computer\" you would want this sorted in the A's and not the C's.\n\nA: iOS will display contacts in a mostly-similar way to macOS.\nAlthough iOS has very little feature support for what the CNContacts framework calls contact type, you can't easily see it, you can't set it, the handling is inconsistent in edge cases, etc.\n", "Q: Refreshing Finder window view after sorting files I have a simple script:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set sort column of list view options of Finder window 1 to size column\nend tell\n\nIt works, but the problem is that the window is stale and does not immediately reflect the new order of the files. I have to change the target of the window to a different directory and then navigate back to see the files sorted by size.\n\nA: There doesn't appear to be a proper solution to this. Here is a workaround hack:\nApplescripts not working in Finder since Mavericks\n", "Q: Why is twitter unreachable from Chrome but not Safari? I am using macOS 10.13.6. When I go to www.twitter.com in Google Chrome I get a\nThis site can't be reached.\nhttps://www.twitter.com/ is unreachable.\nERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE\n\nOn the same machine I can fire up Safari and I can get to the same url with no problem. On Chrome I tried using a guest and incognito account with no luck. I also used the settings feature to restore settings to their original default. Nothing seems to help. I am not having this problem with any other site, just twitter. \n\nA: Egad. I run a network filter (which I thought I disabled when testing this problem) but it turns out I had a rule to deny outgoing connections to twitter.com, which maybe, just maybe, was causing the problem. Mark - thanks for the help and sorry for wasting the bandwidth. \n", "Q: Bluetooth not available: Mojave 10.14.2 I have a MacBook Pro Retina (2015). After updating to OS Mojave, Bluetooth has stopped working. I get an error message that \"No Bluetooth Hardware Found\".\nI have already tried to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the /Library/Preferences and delete the com.apple.Bluetooth.plist file\n\n*Successfully resetting SMC. (pressing Shift+ctrl+alt + power button)\n\n*Removing the Bluetooth icon from the menu bar\n\n*Successfully resetting NVRAM.\nNone of the above solutions has worked for me.\n\nA: It may be necessary for the Bluetooth demon to be stopped when deleting the file. Here's what worked for me (some of this may be unnecessary or redundant):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off bluetooth, e.g. from the toolbar icon.\n\n*Run this command (you'll probably be prompted for your password):\nsudo pkill bluetoothd \\\n    && sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist \\\n    && sudo pkill bluetoothd\n\n\n*Go to the Bluetooth System Preferences pane and click the \"Show bluetooth in menu bar\" checkbox twice (to remove and then re-show it).\n\n*In the Bluetooth System Preferences pane, delete the device you want to connect to.\n\n*Turn on bluetooth.\n\n*Turn that device on and in pairing mode.\n\n*Pair with it.\nIt was not necessary for me to do anything with the SMC or NVRAM, or restart the machine.\n\nA: It's frequent on my MacBook Pro, but I don't have to do anything drastic.\nI just follow these steps in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Bluetooth\n\n*Click on Turn Bluetooth Off button\n\n*Uncheck Show Bluetooth in menu bar\n\n*Check again Show Bluetooth in menu bar\n\n*Click on Turn Bluetooth Off button\n\n\nNot sure if it's just luck but I don't need to do anything else.\n\nA: A colleague of mine had accidentally removed the list of all the connected wifi networks on my system which has since resolved this issue for me! \n\nA: I had the \"bluetooth not available\" and tried all the solutions. My problem ended up to be a loose cable that connects the motherboard to the wifi/bluetooth device mounted near the hinge. Once a repair guy pointed out the config, I just pushed down on on the bottom of the laptop case in the middle and it worked. \n\nA: In terminal, also remove the com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist and com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist files from ~/Library/Preferences.\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nsudo rm com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist\nsudo rm com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist\n\nThen restart.\nThat fixed it for me.\n\nA: Like one other person I read about, this same Bluetooth issue for me was caused by a new Displayport cable from my second monitor (I'm running two external monitors) to my Macbook Pro 2015 Mojave 10.14.6 (the other person said it was an HDMI cable from their second monitor).\nResetting PRAM worked once. As did deleting .plist files, but the issue would return after each restart. \nI went back to the old VGA monitor cable and the issue was resolved. \n", "Q: Can I reboot or reset AirPort Extreme remotely over wifi using my Mac? Internet connection at my home (provided by the housing company) — shared to wifi via Airport Extreme — nowadays quite often cuts off. When this happens, my MacBook is still connected to the wifi just fine, but access to internet is down.\nThe only reliable way I’ve found to fix this is to walk over to the  Airport Extreme, disconnect its power cord & connect it again, causing it to reboot. Soon, after the wifi becomes available again, internet connection is back too.\nMy question: is there any remote or \"software\" way of resetting or rebooting Airport Extreme to get the internet connection back up? (For example using AirPort Utility or something on the command line on my Mac.)\n\nIf it matters: AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th generation) running software version 7.6.9.\n\nA: The AirPort Utility app has a Base Station Menu, with the option to restart.\n\nA: The \"Restart...\" command in the \"Base Station\" menu of Airport Utility exists for this reason.\n\nA: From memory there is such a function directly within one of the menus of Airport Utility.\nBeware in case of modification of your AirPort Extreme configuration to be sure to be able to access it from your Mac once it will have restarted. The AirPort Extreme restart will take around 60 seconds.\n", "Q: How to stop iTunes from syncing voice memos from my iPhone? iTunes 12.8.0, iPhone with iOS 12.1.2. Sync over wi-fi enabled to sync photos, everything else is manual. Every time iPhone syncs over wi-fi it imports voice memos in my iTunes library and I delete them every time. I don't want them on the computer. Just in the cloud and the phone, that's it. Is it a bug or I need to configure something differently?\n\nA: Most likely you have voice memos sync enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your phone via USB.\n\n*Go to phone > Music tab.\n\n*Uncheck 'Sync voice memos'.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do you delete a mailbox from your Yahoo app on the iPhone? I have an iPhone 8 running the latest version of the yahoo mail app (4.37)\nIn the app, I can either \"Add another mailbox\" or add another account thru \"Manage Accounts\"\nI initially added my account as a mailbox through the \"Add another mailbox\" link.  It added my account/mailbox but didn't load all my emails.  I then clicked \"Manage Accounts\" and added my account.\nGoing thru \"Manage Accounts\" to add my account shows all my emails.  Now, I want to delete the mailbox that was created.  However, I can't seem to do so.  I even went through \"Manage Accounts\" to delete the account, hoping that it would remove both the mailbox and account but it didn't.\nI followed the directions on Yahoo's website but those instructions didn't work\nI also tried adding my gmail account (as a test to delete it) thru the Yahoo mail app as a mailbox.  I'm running into the same problem, I can't delete my gmail account/mailbox either.\nHopefully someone can help me.  Thanks.\nUPDATE: Deleting the app didn't work.  The mailboxes are still here.\nI also tried going to my Iphone Settings->Yahoo Mail->Reset All Accounts.  Also didn't work.  Both my gmail account and that rogue yahoo account is still there.\n\nA: From Yahoo's site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the Menu icon Image of the Sidebar menu icon..\n\n*Tap Manage Accounts.\n\n*Tap Account info below the Yahoo Mail account that's linked.\n\n*Tap the X beside the linked account. <- I assume you did this, and it did not delete.\n\n*Tap Unlink to confirm.\n\n\nFrom: \nhttps://help.yahoo.com/kb/add-remove-email-accounts-yahoo-mail-sln26459.html (your link took me to different document...)\nIf the account doesn't go away via the Yahoo delete instructions, I think you should look for sending a report to Yahoo.\n\nA: Go to Manage Accounts - Under your primary account, you'll see an Account Info hyperlink.  Click on that and it will take you to a secondary screen.  At the bottom is where you'll see the x next to all of your linked accounts. Select the one you don't want and it will unlink from there.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I went to manage accounts and settings but nothing appeared. But I figured it out. You go to settings-> manage mailboxes and delete there.\nIf it doesn’t show up, like I think it did for me, delete the app and reinstall it. Go to settings again and sure enough right under manage accounts would be manage mailboxes. \nHope this helps people in the future.\n]1\n", "Q: Macbook 2009 Memory Question I'm working on a MacBook (13-inch, Late 2009) 2.26 GHz Intel Core Duo.\nI'm attempting to install two memory modules labelled 4GB DDRL-1600 SODIMM by Crucial (Memory Module A1/A2)\nI'm unable to install two simultaneously. The modules (either one discounting a bad module) one of the pairs works correctly when paired with a 2GB 2RX8 PC3-10600S-999 (Memory Module B1,B2) by ADATA. Why would they work when paired but not simultaneously? The logic board supports up to 8 GB?\nThe combinations are written below.\n\n\n*\n\n*B1+B2 = works\n\n*A1+B1 = works\n\n*A2+B1 = works\n\n*A1+B2 = works\n\n*A2+B2 = works\n\n*A1+A2 = doesn't work?\n\n\nMy goal is to determine if I need to return the memory modules.\n\n\nA: Crucial own website says this memory is not compatible with your model Mac. I suppose this might be because officially your model Mac does not support 8 GB of memory.\nThe simplest explanation for your problem is the Mac adjusts the timing based on the the memory installed. Most likely the ADATA memory is slightly slower thus causing the Mac run the Crucial module at this reduced speed. When both Crucial modules are installed, this restriction is lifted, but this causes some other timing conflict that prevents the memory from working properly.\nAccording the the manual for your Mac, the memory should meet the requirements given below. (The link to your manual came from this Apple website.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Double Data Rate Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (DDR3) format\n\n*30 mm (1.18 inches)\n\n*204-pin\n\n*1 GB or 2 GB\n\n*PC3-8500 DDR3 SO-DIMM 1066 MHz Type RAM\n\n\nCrucial recommends DDR3 PC3-8500 memory for your Mac. I realize this module is not 4GB.\nFrom the image you posted, I assume the ADATA memory is PC3-10600.\nYou bought Crucial DDR3 PC3-12800 memory. This memory does not even appear on CRUCIAL® MEMORY FOR MAC® SYSTEMS COMPATIBILITY CHART.\nAccording to this compatibility chart, you would want the CT2K4G3S1067M pair of modules.\nA good table comparing the different modules can be found here.\n\nNote: I have aways been annoyed that the older slower memory is often more expensive that the newer faster memory.\n\n", "Q: Prevent Giant Tabs in Safari Using Sierra 10.13.6\nI suddenly noticed today that my safari browser has giant tabs\n\nI am pretty sure that earlier I had fixed sized tabs and not the ones which run across my entire screen.\n\nA: Fixed-width tabs were used up until Safari 4. Starting with either Safari 5 or 6 (I'm not sure which because I can't find a screenshot of Safari 5's tab bar), the style switched to full-width. Safari 6 was released alongside macOS Mountain Lion in 2012.\nSo, unless you just upgraded from a version of macOS earlier than Mountain Lion, your tabs have always been full-width.\nUnfortunately, I don't know of a way to change the style back to fixed-width if that's what you prefer.\n\nA: There's a SIMBL plugin called SafariStand with an option \"Suppress Tab Bar Width\" that nicely reverts the tab bar width back to a shorter size.\nAs Safari versions and MacOS versions increase, and introduce things like SIP and library validation, it gets more and more difficult to get SIMBL and this plugin in particular to install & work.\nI've used it on El Capitan and Safari 10, and after that I haven't (yet) had the patience to try and get it installed/working.\nThe various forks for SafariStand that I've seen/been tracking:\nhttps://github.com/hetima/SafariStand\n\"Safari 8.0.x / OS X 10.10.x\"\nhttps://github.com/anakinsk/SafariStand\n\"Safari 11, 10.1 & 10.0 on Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra and High Sierra\"\nhttps://github.com/w0lfschild/SafariStand\n\"Safari 12, 11, 10 on Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra and Mojave\"\n", "Q: Where does the stderr from launchd go? launchd items in /Library/LaunchDaemon may redirect stdin/stdout/stderr.

Either I was mistaken or there was some setup I cannot reproduce that got the stderr output lost. Probably the first (picnic, problem in chair, not in computer).\n\nA: Your second key has a typo in it (has a > before the closing </key>)\n                      *\n<key>StandardErrorPath></key>\n    <string>/Library/Logs/rnamanagedocker_err.log</string>\n\nIt should be\n<key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/Library/Logs/rnamanagedocker_err.log</string>\n\n\nA: Try making sure that the system is actually permitted to write to that file. I would suggest simply creating the file in advance (as an empty file). You can do that with the Terminal as follows:\ntouch /Library/Logs/rnamanagedocker_err.log\n\nThen try first by making the file writable by everyone to see, if that makes it work:\nchmod a+w /Library/Logs/rnamanagedocker_err.log\n\nIf you want then you can then start limited the permissions on the file to get to the level you require.\n", "Q: Config AppleWatch what to dial during \"Fall Detection\"? I do not want \"Fall Detection\" to dial 911 if I were walking, fall, and all I need to do is rest. I've been running on trails, stumbled and fell to the ground. I sat there and resting. But, I think by accident the fall detection dialed emergency services.\n\nA: Source:\nFall detection on your Apple Watch Series 4 is off by default unless you are age 65 or older.  There's no way to get Fall Detection to do what you want, it's not configurable that way.  I think your only option is to turn it off. \nFrom Apple's Support document:\n\nIf you've entered your age when you set up your Apple Watch or in the\n  Health app and you're age 65 and over, this feature automatically\n  turns on.\n\nIf, for any reason, you decide that you don't want Fall Detection on, you can disable it in the Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n*Tap the My Watch tab at the bottom left.\n\n*Tap Emergency SOS.\n\n*Scroll down and turn off Fall Detection.

I have a late 2013 Mac Pro that had been running Sierra before its internal SSD died. I'd like to replace the internal drive, but OWC's site indicates the following:\n\"macOS 10.13 and later versions include an EFI (firmware) update that adds support for the Aura Pro X to the host computer. If you do not first update the host firmware by installing macOS 10.13 or later onto the existing SSD, the Aura Pro X will not function properly once installed.\"\nIs there a way to get the Mac's EFI updated using an external drive so it will be able to make use of the replacement internal drive?\nInternet recovery allowed me to do a fresh Mavericks install on the machine, and I'm currently updating it to El Capitan, from which I'll hopefully be able to get Sierra running, but I'm expecting that High Sierra will give me trouble on the external drive.\nAny recommendations?\nThanks!\n\nA: The firmware updates are now included in macOS installs. Upgrading by installing High Sierra or Mojave to a USB external drive should cause the firmware to be updated. I have a external HDD with a APFS container partition. I installed High Sierra to this container using a 2011 iMac. I also installed Mojave in the same container (to a different volume) using a 2013 iMac. The firmware on both Mac was updated or I would not be able to boot from the external drive. (Although I can not boot Mojave on the 2011 iMac, which was expected.)\n\nA: *\n\n*update original OS hard drive to Mojave\n\n*make time machine backup\n\n*format a USB stick with APFS\n\n*make a Mojave bootable installer from that stick\n\n*shut down computer completely\n\n*put Aura into mac pro. \n\n*trick: boot from USB stick which is now APFS and mountable by boot loader with newer disk utility (included in Mojave installer)\n\n*at this point you cannot direct install to drive BUT  it will allow restore from time machine!!!!\n\n", "Q: How to download Maps for Apple maps? How does one cache map data to enable GPS navigation without network access?  I would like to cache maps before visiting an island.\n\nA: iOS and macOS cache maps as you browse, so the first step is to visit all the places at the scales you wish so your system has a chance to cache the content. \nI’m not aware of a way to force or pin these, so you might need a dedicated map if you have to be sure you have a complete offline map data. \n", "Q: VLC does not play all songs I copied a couple dozen MP3s to an iPhone through iTunes.

after then and the next limit.\nIf you've painted yourself into a corner, you would have to copy the data off to a new drive (USB) and then remove all the containers except one. At that point, you should be able to grow the one container back to full use of the disk. Should that fail, an erase / reinstall / then not make multiple containers going forward is the path for you to get where you can put BootCamp after the APFS Container is large enough for the Apple files and volumes.\nThat being said, your details are superb and it looks like you might be able to iterate to a spot where you can move the files and have two copies of all the data and then retire all the containers except for one.\nIf you like this, start by retiring by deleting the APFS containers marked in RED. It looks like they are Untitled and from comments, you don’t want those and you don't need to get any data saved from them.\n\nThe green containers should remain - don’t delete them. Once you retire disk0s3 and disk0s5 - you will want to see if you can resze disk0s2 to be larger. In the end, you want it to be 1.0 TB (or as close to that as you can grow) before you let BootCamp shrink it to carve out space for windows.\nPlease look at this thread for much better information on cleaning up APFS Containers:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove a container disk and reclaim space with main partition?\nOnce that's done you can attempt to expand the main container disk0s2 in your case so you can copy data over from disk0s4 and then clean that container up as well and then finally expand to have one container at 1.0 TB\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nThe last command with a size 0 should try and expand container disk2 as much as possible. We might need to revisit things or better - ask a follow on question with the new listing rather than us keep editing the question then the answer back and forth.\n\nI'm not even sure how you made all 4 containers - when I tried to reproduce your setup so I could check the syntax to delete the extra containers - I get this warning.\n\nOnce you get things cleaned up - be sure to just make volumes for your Mac storage so the simple clean up of deleting files will free space.\n\nA: To install Windows using Boot Camp, open Boot Camp Assistant from the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. Then follow the onscreen instructions to repartition your startup disk.\nThis assistant should make the space needed. Are you getting an error message when you try the assistant?\n", "Q: Update 200 multiple devices with the same specs at the same time? I have 200 iPOD touch devices with the same specs. Currently, i am updating them one by one using Apple Configurator which does not require me to download the update multiple times. But, i still have to connect the devices and go through the update process one device at a time.\nIs there a better way to do this?\n\nA: One option would be to update the iOS directly on the iPod Touch (if you haven't disabled that option), otherwise you can speed up the process by connecting multiple devices to your Mac at once and update them in one go.\nThis can be done with multiple USB-Lightning cables plugged directly in to the computer, or by using USB hubs. A more expensive solution would be to buy a dedicated syncing/charging-station. These types of products often allow you to lock multiple iOS devices inside a cage or similar, and have them all easily charge and/or connected to a single Mac for syncing/updating. They come in various sizes for holding for example 4 devices, 16 devices, etc.\n", "Q: Will your private tabs still be open when you exit out of private mode? I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to exit out of my private mode without my open private tabs being deleted. Does anyone knows what happens, if you exit out off private mode and then go back to private mode, will they be still there?\n\nA: If you are talking about iOS, yes. Private tabs will be preserved.\nIn macOS, once you close the private tab(s), they are gone.\n", "Q: What is the best/fastest way to rip and convert a Blu-ray Disc on an iMac? I've recently switched (back) from Windows 10 to macOS running on an iMac 27-inch Retina late 2015. While I still used my Windows 10 laptop, I used a program called DVDFab to rip my collection of Blu-ray movies into a format suitable for Plex and Emby. The process took about 45 minutes per disc and used the GPU part of the Intel i7 processor in my laptop to speed things up.\nNow that I am on a Mac, I can't seem to find a program (or set of programs) that allows me to rip Blu-ray movies with the same, or better, speed. Most articles seem to suggest a combination of MakeMKV for ripping and Handbrake for converting. However, this takes about 45 minutes for ripping and 2 hours for converting, as none of these programs seems to make use of GPU acceleration. I have also downloaded a few commercial packages to see if they make use of acceleration, but I have yet to find a program that both can read directly from a Blue-ray disc and do the transcoding to give me a suitably small mp4 file.\nCan you recommend a solution other than sticking with Windows 10 and DVDFab?\n\nA: So I found a solution, just not a short or elegant one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install bootcamp on the iMac\n\n*Install Windows 10\n\n*Install dvdfab.\n\n\nAt first dvdfab did not want to work with the GPU (AMD Radeon). Turns out that the graphic drivers bundled with bootcamp were too old, but there is no update from Apple. http://bootcampdrivers.com has newer driver packages for the mac / AMD GPU.\nI had to follow a long set of instructions to install it, including booting the Windows machine into Safe mode. In the end, everything works as it should, and Blu-ray conversion time is now around 40 minutes!\nAs converting Blu-ray movies is not something I do everyday, I can live with this solution.\n", "Q: How to refer to Applescript dictionary objects with spaces in the name I'm trying to write an Applescript that accesses EyeTV (yes, I still have one running!). I'm trying to list the recordings in the programs window. From the dictionary:\napplication n [see also Standard Suite] : the EyeTV application\n  elements\n   contains player_windows, programs, recordings, channels, favorites lists.\n  properties\n   current recording (double integer, r/o) : unique id of the current (frontmost) recording. Returns 0 if there is none.\n  programs window (programs_window, r/o) : schedule dialog\n\nFurther down in the dictionary is:\nprograms_window n [inh. window] : window containing the list of programs and recordings\n  elements\n   contains programs, recordings.\n  properties\n   selection (list of list) : A list containing every selected recording, channel or schedule (program) in the programs window, depending on what the current category is.\n\nIf I right click the dictionary and choose \"New script\" it will helpfully start the script for me:\ntell application \"EyeTV\"\n\nend tell\n\nI then add the line that is the problem:\ntell application \"EyeTV\"\n    set recordList to recordings of programs window\nend tell\n\nIf I compile this I get \"Syntax Error Expected end of line but found class name.\"\nIf I use programs_window instead, on running the script the error will be The variable programs_window is not defined.\nI found a script someone else has written to export recordings from EyeTV to Plex, and it uses programs window. If I copy and paste the whole script and try to compile it I again receive the error Syntax Error Expected end of line but found class name.\nI'm unsure how to proceed. Should I be referring to the programs window property of the application or the programs_window class? How can I get rid of the errors?\nI have a copy of the AppleScript Language Guide but it seems to say nothing on the topic of application dictionaries.\nAny help with this would be much appreciated.\n\nA: There was a simple fix, make sure the application is running during the compilation phase. I find that strange considering it has the dictionary and isn't (or I assume it isn't) making any calls to the application in question, but that's the way it is.\nA little digging brought up a book about Applescript a few versions back but it obviously still applies (emphasis mine).\n\nExternal Referents Needed at Compile Time\nAppleScript is a little language, leaving it up to various external\n  entities such as scriptable applications (or scripting additions) to\n  extend the language as needed. When the time comes to compile a\n  script, if it makes any use of such externally defined extensions to\n  the language, those external entities must be present, and AppleScript\n  must be able to locate them, so that it can ascertain whether the\n  words you’re using in your code correspond to extensions to the\n  language defined in these external entities, and if so, how to\n  translate them into bytecode.\n\nThis is one more instance of the ancient call to developers - please, make your error messages better.\n", "Q: Key combinations CTRL+SHIFT+D/E/F not working I found that the key combinations Ctrl-Shift-D/E/F somtimes are not working\nI really do not know what caused this, but a few tests are as follows,\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer or logging out and back in is the only two ways I know to temporarily solve the problem, but the issue comes back after some period (no idea what triggered this);\n\n*The hardware is OK (I think). I used the Keyboard Viewer and can see that only these three combinations have problems. Specifically, I can see that when SHIFT and CTRL are pressed, pressing D,E,or F has no response. Others are fine, for example, CTRL+SHIFT+T works fine;\n\n*While on screen saver, the key combinations works fine while I experiment on the passwords I typed. \n\n\nHow can I resolve this?\nPS: I recently updated to Mojave, but I recall that the issue happened once before the update. Also the model is MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013), and currently I'm not using an external keyboard. (I just tried plugging in another keyboard, still not working.)\n\nA: I just found out that the problem is caused by Sougou Pinyin, a Chinese input software, who recently updated itself with some features along with these new shortcut keys as shown below (pls excuse the Chinise interface)\n\n(Obviously I missed the shift+cmd+E).\nNow I have disabled them all.\n", "Q: Force any printer to convert all colors to Grayscale automatically? I've got a color inkjet printer, and I only have black ink left. \nI want my printer to automatically convert all colors printed to a grayscale equivalent.\nI'd like a solution that works with any printer, not just my specific printer.\nIs this possible using a virtual printer or something like that?\nNote that as stated in the title, I'd love to be able to do this automatically, so I don't have to select options in a print dialog every time.\n\nA: A \"one-size-fits-all\" approach may not be possible, as different printers have different capabilities and driver controls for specifying Black ink only. \nYou could try the Color Matching pane of the print dialog: select ColorSync, and select a Greyscale or Black & White color profile. However, even if you do this, some printers may still try to print this as a '4-color Black', to spread the ink usage across all the cartridges.\nYour best option is to determine what controls your printer has (if any) for printing to Black ink only: then select them in the print dialog and save as a Print Preset.\n\nA: Using the CUPS web interface, I was able to change the default setting for my Canon MX860 to greyscale from color. Previously, I had to go the the Printer Features dropdown in the macOS print dialog and change it manually for each print job. This greyscale setting persist between print jobs and system restarts. This may not be precisely what your looking for: a setting which will affect any and all printers attached to your computer at any time, but at least it sets greyscale as the default print option. \nTo use CUPS, you first need to enable the CUPS set interface in Terminal:\n\nsudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nand use an administrator's password to authenticate.\nOnce the Web interface has been enabled, access CUPS by going to this URL in the browser of your choice:\n\nlocalhost:631/printers\n\nThen under the Administration drop-down for the printer of your choice, choose Set Default Options, which leads to this settings sheet:\n\nI would suggest you disable web access to CUPS when you are done. I'm not sure what kind of nefarious access to your machine can be accomplished through CUPS, but you never know:\n\nsudo cupsctl WebInterface=no\n\n", "Q: Macbook 7.1 (mid-2010): upgrade from 10.8 to 10.12 I've tried several times to update my Macbook 7.1 (Macbook white mid-2010, 4GB ram)  from 10.8.5 to Sierra but the progress bar remains blocked after the first boot.\nWhen booting into Verbose mode, here is what I obtain: \nAfter a while, I have other messages like:\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 1\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 4\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 4\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 2\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 4\nSmartBattery: finished polling type 4\n\nWhich seems to be the same issue than:\nMac Sierra won't boot - SmartBattery: finished polling type 4\n\nA: Two solutions were kindly given by Allan, I chose the \"easiest\" one: \n\n\n*\n\n*In recovery mode, access to Terminal\n\n*In /Volumes/\"Macintosh HD\"/System/Library/Extensions directory, remove Huawei .kext files (using rm -rf command) or other non-essential kext files.

Although I've got several pieces in place, one of the parts that slows me down the most is putting a scanned file into the right folder. Find the folder and then dragging and dropping the file over is really tedious when I'm staring at a mound of papers that need to be filed.\nWhat would be much much better is if I could \"file\" a file without having to touch the trackpad, i.e. only using the keyboard, but I'm stumped at how to do this.\nMy setup\nInspired by the ebook Paperless, I'm using the following:\n\n*\n\n*Fuji ix500 scanner\n\n*Simple folder structure using MacOS and finder (with the OCR capabilities of the bundled software of the Fuji scanner coupled with the search capabilities of Mac OS, I can find pretty much any file I need just using search)\n\n*Hazel, for automatically extracting dates from file contents and sometimes moving files.\n\nWhat I've tried\nI started going down the path of setting up Hazel rules to capture the majority of documents that I file. The benefit of this is that if the Hazel looks inside a file with, say, the name of my mortgage company, the rule will have the file automatically moved to the folder for my mortgage company.\nThe drawback to this approach is that it's tedious to set up each rule, and there's a long tail of documents that are unique enough to not justify making a rule. So then the process comes down to two things:\n\n*\n\n*Name the file\n\n*Put the file in the correct subfolder\n\nI can speed up naming the file with tools like Text Expander, but I'm stumped at how to speed up putting the file into the correct subfolder.\nWhat I'd like to do is something like this:\n\n*\n\n*Have the file selected in finder.\n\n*Press Spacebar to preview the contents to know how to name it.\n\n*Press Enter to edit the name.\n\n*Edit the name and press enter.\n\n*[this is the part that doesn't exist yet....] Press a shortcut to bring up a text box that asks where I want to move the file.\n\n*I start typing and autocomplete starts narrowing down the folders.\n\n*I arrow down to the correct folder and press enter.\n\n*The file is moved to the folder I chose.\n\n*The next file in finder is now selected so I can quickly file it (back to step 2).\n\nI'd be open to trying Apple Script if it helped me accomplish my goal, but I'm not even sure if Apple Script can help with this sort of thing.\nSo to restate my original question, what's a quick way to \"file\" a file manually into a folder on my machine only using the keyboard?\n\nA: If your Mac is running Mavricks or later, you could try opening multiple tabs using CMD+T in a Finder window to rapidly copy/move files from the  \"source\" folder where your scanned files are located (in the first tab) to other \"destination\" folders visible in the other tabs. Press CTRL+TAB to move forward to the next tabbed window or CTRL+SHIFT+TAB to move backwards to the previous tabbed window. If you know which destination folders you'll be moving your files to then you can open a tab with each of those folders visible before you get started. \nDo your file preview & rename in your first tab, then press CMD+C to copy the file. Press CTRL+TAB however many times you need to move to the destination tab then press CMD+OPT+V to move the file into that folder.\n\nA: You could use Applescript if you have filenames that « showed » which folder they will belong in. So the folder AAA will have all files with filenames staring with A or a etc. Was involved with something similar for results files (about 200,000) where the first two characters defined one part, next two characters another part etc Worked great : was when filenames were limited to 8.3 way back when...\nThe script to move the files from source to wherever will be a nice exercise, could also include a copy for backup...\n\nA: I am currently developing an app (https://taggytagger.com) that does something similar using tags. It's not yet released but you can sign-up for beta access.\nBasically, you select a folder that the app watches for file changes. If a new file is added to that folder and gets a specific tag, the app executes a copy/move action. \nSo, in your step 5 you would instead select a tag to move the file. FYI: Tags can be added using shortcuts as well. Here is a quick How-to setup a keyboard shortcut for tags written by me.\nRight now, the app is limited in that regard, though, because there are only 4 pre-defined action tags (dropbox, box, onedrive & gdrive, provided these services are installed). However, the destination folders are freely selectable. \nGenerally, I'm open to feedback. So, if it appears to be useful to create more/your own action tags, happy to put it on the roadmap.\n", "Q: Cannot connect multiple PS4 controllers through bluetooth I have two PS4 controllers but I'm unable to connect both by bluetooth on my iMac and Mac Book Pro, both running Mojave.\nI can pair one of them (say A) and, as soon as I do it, the other one (say B) is not recognized through bluetooth.

Both gamepads connected / working at the same time.\nRecommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all BT devices paired from Mac\n\n*Make sure Mac picked up the BT dongle as controller vs builtin one (ALT-click on BT icon and check for MAC address change).\n\n*Reconnect / pair BT devices\n\n*I had to reset one of my DualShock (https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-ps4-controller-4174025)\n\n\nPS: could not answer similar question Use more than one PS4 Dualshock controller over bluetooth due to lack of reputation\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: 10.6.8 Update Combo Failed Unknown Error I recently received an old iMac 27\" aluminum unibody core 2 duo (EMC 2309: 2009 model) that was having troubles with the graphics card after High Sierra installation. I was looking to set it up as a media-station/test-machine, and was thinking Snow Leopard would be perfect. I already have an old mac mini on my desk running MacOSX10.6.8, but rather than copying over my hard drive, I decided to do a fresh install. It was during the 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1, after the install, that I encountered a problem. I found an identical thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6883727 but there was no clear answer to the problem, and I did not want to go through hours of a slower-than-my-normal-internet-speed download from https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1399?locale=en_US \nI already had saved a copy of the MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.8.dmg on the same drive with my 10.6.2 Install Volume, and the 10.6.2 install had run smoothly. I went to run the 10.6.8 update, only to get an installation failure with an \"unknown error\":\n\nIt turns out the MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.8.dmg available online is not quite the same as the one I had previously downloaded, the file size was slightly smaller, and the creation date later.\n\nIs this simply a case a developer signature expiring, and publishing a rerelease? If so, Is my new MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.8.dmg also going to expire? It's just nice not to have to wait to re-download something from a crappy link for hours only to discover it timed out at less than 5%. I was hoping to make an install media for this, but it seams pointless if it's not going to work the next time I need it. Is there a way to get around installer expiration issues?\n\nA: Set the date on the Mac back to to for example 1st of May 2012 using \"Date & Time\" in System Preferences. Remember to turn off \"Set date and time automatically\".\nThis will allow you to bypass the expiration check.\nRemember to set the time and date back when you're done updating.\n", "Q: Bootcamp disk not recognized, can’t get gdisk to work \nUPDATE: This is for a Mac Pro (Mid-2010) MacPro5,1 with the latest\n  firmware, 6-core 3.46 Intel Xeon, 32GB 1333 Mhz DDR3 memory.\n\nI tried the instructions on this post: Triple Boot: “Missing operating system” on Windows 7 partition after Ubuntu installation\n on my Mac Pro and I’m getting the following at the end of the gdisk commands:\n\nWarning!

The drive (disk0) you are referring to is using a Master Boot Record partition table (FDisk_partition_scheme). The command provided by macOS for editing MBR partition table drives is called fdisk.\nThe current version of gdisk is 1.0.4. If are using the current version, then you would have encountered this message after entering the command.\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.4\n\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: MBR only\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: not present\n\n\n***************************************************************\nFound invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR to GPT format\nin memory.

I made this assumption because you appear to have installed Windows to BIOS boot.\nI can see the first partition on disk0 is not marked as active. This would be a requirement for a BIOS booting windows 10. You would need to make the entries given below to correct this problem. If you get the message fdisk: /dev/disk0: Operation not permitted, then you will need to either disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) or make the entries while booted to Recovery mode.\n\nNote: When using fdisk to display the contents of the MBR partition table, the active (bootable) partition is flagged with the * letter. In your question, you can see that partition 2 is marked as active.\n\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nflag 1\nquit\ny\n\nBelow is an example.\nMarlin:~ davidanderson$ sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> f 1\nPartition 1 marked active.\nfdisk:*1> quit\nWriting current MBR to disk.\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect.

I am trying to move a couple of folders from my Desktop to an external Hard Drive as Finder is not working.\nWhen I type command mount, I get the HD listed, but when I try to use command ls or cp I get No such file or directory.\nAny idea why? And what could be the remedy?\nThe full command I'm trying to use is cp ~/Desktop/*.jpg ~/Volumes/1 where 1 is the name of the external HD.\nI'm on a Mac Pro running macOS Sierra. \n\nA: Based on your question it appears the problem you're having is related to the use of ~ in the external drive file path in the terminal commands you're trying to use. \nBasically, the tilde symbol (~) in macOS command line usage refers to your home directory, e.g /Users/Veronique.\nSo, if you're trying to run a command such as: cp ~/Desktop/*.jpg ~/Volumes/1 this won't work because it's looking in the wrong place for the drive named 1. Instead, the command you need to use would be:\ncp ~/Desktop/*.jpg /Volumes/1\n\nRemember also that if your external drive name has a space in it, then you need to factor this into your command. For example, let's say you're trying to copy a file called ATM.jpg from your user Desktop folder to an external drive called Backup Drive, then your command would be:\ncp ~/Desktop/ATM.jpg /Volumes/Backup\\ Drive\n\nNote the use of the backslash and space to denote the space in the external drive name.\n", "Q: Use iTunes credit to purchase items I have redeemed several hundred dollars of iTunes money to my Apple account. Is there any any app(s) in the store that allow you to pay for something (at a high price of course, due to Apple’s fees) that can be shipped to your door (and potentially re-sold) with iTunes credit?\nIs this allowed in Apple’s App Store Terms of Services, or are all In-App Purchases intended to cover some digital artefacts?\nIf so, do apps allow you to buy currency which is in turn redeemable for something tangible or exchangeable?\n\nA: iTunes Store credit can be used only for purchasing content sold on the App Store/iTunes Store, or for upgrading iCloud storage. Official instructions can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Redeem App Store & iTunes Gift Cards, Apple Music Gift Cards, and content codes\nSelling of physical goods is not permitted on the App Store as per the App Store Review Guidelines.

Can I play the sound from the video playing on macOS with the iPhone, preferably without connecting the iPhone to the Mac so that I can plug in the EarPods to the iPhone's socket?\nThis is basically the reverse of Can I play audio from my iPhone on my Mac?\n\nA: This can be done using an app called Airfoil. \nDescription of Airfoil app:\n\nStream any audio from your Mac all around your network.

But I need to keep Outlook around for those rare cases I need it (for instance editing distribution lists on the server).\nBut this makes Spotlight searches really convoluted. Every mail shows up twice. Is there any way I can disable the content from individual apps from being part of the Spotlight index? Or an obscure setting (I've looked) inside Outlook that disables Spotlight indexing?\n\nA: You need to tell Spotlight not to search the Outlook Database on your local machine. \nAssuming you're using MS Office 2016 or later \nHere's how,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Spotlight\n\n*Click the Privacy Tab \n\n*Locate your Outlook Database which can be found in the Library folder within you home folder. So /Users/userfolder/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/\n\n*Drag the Outlook folder into the privacy tab you opened earlier within System Preferences.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Spotlight under System settings and go to the Exceptions tab.\n\n*Add the folder /Users/yourusername/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data/\n\n\n...now everything from Outlook is excempt from Spotlight.\n\nA: When performing a search, you can include -kind:mail and/or -kind:event to exclude Outlook emails and events.\nThis method lets you exclude Outlook items from the Spotlight search, while still allowing Outlook to search its own items. If you move the Outlook folder to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy, Outlook will no longer be able to search its own email, events, etc.\n", "Q: My External Hard Drive's format changed to FAT16 without any reason I have an ADATA HD710 1TB external hard drive which I use mostly in my Mac Mini 2011 and I have created two separate partitions for my drive.\nOne of the partitions has APFS (Apple File System) format and the other has MS-DOS FAT (FAT32) format. I use the second one for Windows 10 that is installed on my computer using Bootcamp. As it's not possible to view files of the drive which is formatted in APSF in Windows I use that FAT32 partition to move some files from my main drive to that and view them in Windows.\nYesterday I plugged my external drive in to Windows 10 and after copying some files I just ejected it. Today when I tried to access my files in macOS I realized that my Hard drive's format is changed to FAT16 and none of the two partitions which I had created are displayed.\n\nI tried repairing my drive using the Disk Utility's First Aid feature but it didn't work. I also tried repairing it via Terminal using diskutil repairDisk command and the result was the same as Disk Utility. Finally, I tried repairing it in Windows (using diskpart commands) and I was unsuccessful again.\nHow can I fix this issue? \n\nPlease notice that I really need the information inside my main\n  partition of the drive (The FAT32 partition is not that important for\n  me). Otherwise, I know that if I erase the whole drive, I can use it again.\n\nThe exact error message that I get when I connect my external drive to macOS is:\n\nThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\n\n\nA: It seems somehow the partition table (and possibly more) was corrupted on your hard drive, as you indicate that the drive is not readable anymore in macOS or from Windows.\nThe next step is to stop touching the drive at all before you have made a bit-for-bit image copy of everything on it to secondary storage. After that you can work on copies of that image in order to try to rescue your data.\nIt might be that you accidentally overwrote the partition table unknowingly. Then data recovery is probably fairly easy. It might be that your drive is starting to fail and various errors pop up sporadically - this is usually much, much harder to recover data from.\nIn order to create a bit-for-bit copy of the drive, you'll need to find the disk number from Disk Utility. In your screenshot it is currently listed as \"disk2\", please ensure that you double check this before proceeding.\nWhen you have the disk number, open Terminal and run the following command:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=my_image_file.img bs=512 conv=noerror,sync\n\nThe command probably takes a long while to complete - creating a new file named \"my_image_file.img\" containing a complete copy of your drive. Make sure that you have space enough to store the file. If you haven't got room on your internal drive, you can plug in another external drive and store the file there.\nThe \"noerror\" and \"sync\" options to dd makes sure that if there are drive read errors (i.e. the drive is actually physically failing) then dd will try to skip the errors, replacing those with bytes containing zeros. This won't get you the data back ofcourse, but it makes a lot easier to recover the rest of the data.\nWhen you have the image copy, you can use any data extraction / data recovery software to work on the image to try to find your partitions, file systems, or even single files that you want to extract.\n\nA: As I was 100% sure that I hadn't formatted my hard drive, I tried several data recovery apps and one of them worked very well for me. \nI had two partitions in my hard drive. One of them had APFS format and the other had FAT32 format. Unfortunately there were only a few recovery apps that had the capability of scanning raw data of APFS drives and among them M3 Data Recovery Professional Edition for Mac was the best. I paid something like 107.10 Euro but I think it was definitely worth it.\nIt recovered all lost files and then I copied them into a secondary hard drive as @jksoegaard suggested.\n", "Q: How do I get 2 Dell monitors to work with my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) OSX doesn't support MST daisy chaining monitors. I've got 2 brand new monitors and a decent mac and Apple wont let me use it due to software limitations.\nIs there any product I can buy (Amazon preferably) that will let me use my two monitors (not screen mirroring) as I want to? I can plug both displays into the mac but then I can't charge the mac at the same time or close the lid without it going off. Dell U2518D are the displays.\n\nA: If you want more than one monitor, you need to use two different connections, in your case Thunderbolt (Displayport) and some other connection, like HDMI or a dedicated Displayport connection. To do this you need a Thunderbolt 3 dock solution that supports this ability. There are many, such as Elgato, Belkin or CalDigit.\nA recent (December 2018) Wirecutter review is a good place to start.\n", "Q: How to get calendar invites to come in as iCal when i use a gmail address as my appleID?

To create a bootable USB it needs to be formatted into FAT32, not exFAT. The issue is that when copying the .iso to the USB it fails because the file sources/install.wim is 4.4GB. I can't format as exFAT because I cannot boot from that format and I cannot use FAT32 because of the 4.4GB file. I used the command cp -rpv /Volumes/CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9/* /Volumes/WINDOWS10/ after Boot Camp Assistant failed to create the  USB with a \"Drive too small\" error, even though it was a 16GB drive. When I wasn't paying attention, the cp completed and the installer booted, but failed with a missing: sources/install.wim error because the file can't be copied.\nIs there any solution to this problem, or should I just burn a DVD with the installer on it?\nEDIT: I forgot to specify that I was creating a USB for a PC, not a Mac. The Mac was just being used to create an install USB.\nHeres the file:\n\n\nA: I have found that after upgrading to High Sierra, my 2013 iMac could boot the Windows 10 installer from a ExFAT formatted USB flash drive.\nHere are three potential ways to create the USB installer. I am sure there are may other ways.\nAnswer #1\nMac computers running High Sierra or Mojave may be able to boot from USB flash drives that are ExFAT formatted. So, Apple could fix this problem by changing to Boot Camp Assistant to format the USB flash drive as ExFAT instead of FAT32. For now, you can use the following steps to create a USB Windows 10 flash drive installer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Windows 10 October 2018 Update ISO file from the Microsoft website Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File).\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant application to download the Windows Support Software. Look for Download the Windows Support Software under Action on the Menu Bar. After the download finishes, the Window Support Software folder should appear as shown below.\n\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase a 16 GB or larger USB flash drive. Choose Name, Format and Scheme as shown in the image below..\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to mount the ISO file. The name of the ISO file, I downloaded, was Win10_1809Oct_English_x64.iso. The volume name, when mounted, was CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9. Your names may be different.\n\n*Use the Finder application to copy the contents of the ISO file to the USB flash drive. When finished, the root folder of the USB flash drive should appear as shown below.\n\n\n*Use the Finder application to copy the Window Support Software to the USB flash drive. When finished, the root folder of the USB flash drive should appear as shown below.\n\nThe USB flash drive installer can now be used to install Windows on your Mac. If wish to use the flash drive to install Windows 10 on a different Mac, then you should replace the Windows Support Software files with ones downloaded on that Mac.\nAnswer #2\n\nThis answer was suggested (in a now deleted comment) by Solar Mike. I will remove the answer, if he posts a similar answer.\n\nUse a machine running Windows to create the USB flash drive installer. At this point the flash drive does not contain the Windows Support Software provided by Apple. To add this software, follow steps 2 and 6 of Answer #1.\nWhen using the Windows operating system, you can download the application MediaCreationTool1809.exe. This allows the creation of either a USB flash drive installer or the download of an ISO file. Mac users do not download an application. Instead, Mac users can only download the ISO file. The MediaCreationTool1809 creates a FAT32 formatted USB installer. So there must be a difference between the files downloaded for the USB installer and the files downloaded in the ISO. I do not know how many of the files are different. However, I do know the largest file is different. This file contains all the Window 10 images. The MediaCreationTool1809 application creates the file install.esd which is 3.45 GB in size. This is nowhere near the 4 GB limit for files stored on FAT32 formatted volumes. Unfortunately, the ISO substitutes the file install.wim which is 4.4 GB in size. This is well over the 4 GB limit. \n\nEither .esd files are more efficient in storage than .wim files or the install.esd file has less images than the install.wim file. \n\nAnswer #3\nDownload the Windows 10 April 2018 Update ISO file from the Microsoft website Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File). This ISO file is compatible with the Boot Camp Assistant. After using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10, you should goto the Microsoft website Download Windows 10 to upgrade to the Windows 10 October 2018 Update. Note: This last link will only work when booted to Windows. If booted to macOS, then you redirect to Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)\n\nA: The only way I was able to successfully overcome this problem was following this person's guide:\n\nThe final problem is that the install.wim file is too big to copy across to the FAT32-formatted USB stick (you can try, but will be met with an error). On Windows, Microsoft's official solution is to split the file using a special tool designed for these .wim files. Fortunately, there's also a free alternative called wimlib which works on Mac (and Linux).\n\nWith wimlib installed, available via Homebrew (brew install wimlib), you can easily perform the file splitting of install.wim that the Windows 10 ISO will automatically pickup and understand with no extra fuss.\nwimlib-imagex split /Volumes/CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9/sources/install.wim /Volumes/WINDOWS10/sources/install.swm 4000\n\n\nA: Do the following on a PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder called \"wim\" on the root of your C drive (so C:\\wim).  Inside that folder, create another folder called \"split.\"  Of course you can create different names, but for the sake of the following command, we are going with this.  Now copy your large wim file to C:\\wim.\n\n*Type the following command, which will split your wim file into smaller sizes, which will fit perfectly on a FAT32 USB stick:\ndism /split-image /ImageFile:C:\\wim\\install.wim /SWMFile:C:\\wim\\split\\install.swm /FileSize:2000\n\n*Now delete the wim file off of your USB stick (in the sources folder) and replace it with the several .swm files in the C:\\wim\\split folder.  Because we said filesize=2000, it will split the wim file into approx 2GB files.  Had we said 1000, it would be approx 1GB files.\n\n*Now you don't have to mess around with alternate file systems.  Use the media creation tool from Microsoft to build your USB stick, then delete the .esd file out of the \"sources\" folder on the USB stick, then put these split install.swm files in its place.  As long as they are named \"install.swm, install2.swm, etc,\" Windows will treat them like a standard wim file and install Windows normally.\n\nA: 2021 update\n.iso files under 4GB have been removed from most of the posted online sources, including the official Windows download site. As of February 2021, there's only one ISO version available. I had the best luck downloading a free trial of an NFTS emulator for Mac, and formatting the USB drive there. I then followed the instructions on this blog.

I have an iPhone SE and I have noticed the battery drainage is quicker when outside and in the winter.\nI have heard some websites and people say that batteries drain faster in cold. Is this true?\nI know another reason it could drain faster outside is because I’m using Cellular Data and not WiFi.\nOne quote I found:\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries are exposed to cold temperatures, their performance suffers. When cold, a phone battery can drain faster than normal, or it might say it has ample power remaining and then suddenly go dead.\n\nMy phone has recently saying it has ample power and then turns off like it said in the quote.\nIs this true and is there an official statement from Apple?\n\nA: Yes - run times are shorter when the battery is cold.\nApple has this to say: - https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n\nWhen using your device in a very cold environment, you may notice a decrease in battery life, but this condition is temporary. Once the battery’s temperature returns to its normal operating range, its performance will return to normal as well.\n\nOn a technical level, the drain is what the device uses and that doesn't change with the temperature being low. The ability of the battery to produce current and voltage is impaired only while it's cold. The charge is still in the battery, just can't flow as fast. Think molasses, but less dramatic in the cold.\nTo be even more precise, it's not physics like molasses, but it's the actual chemical reaction providing power slows down in the cold to deliver less than enough current to power the device.  \n(Reference)\n", "Q: Bootcamp Support Software 5.0 Does Bootcamp support software 5.0 support a new installation of windows 7 on a disk partitioned by bootcamp assistant on a MacBook Air 11\" early 2014 running OS X El Capitan 10.11.8?\n\nA: The version of the Boot Camp Support Software depends only on the model/year of your Mac and the version Windows you are trying to install. When installing Windows 7, you should only use the Boot Camp Support software given at this Apple website. The only exception would be if this site did not provide a download for your model/year Mac.\nNote: According to Apple, Windows 7 should include Service Pack 1 (SP1). Although, some users have posted success without SP1.\nOnce the Boot Camp Support Software is installed, you can run Apple Update to see if any updates are available. Unfortunately, the Apple Update, installed by some of the older Boot Camp Support Software versions, is no longer supported by the Apple servers. However, if you install iTunes or iCloud, you will get a newer working version of the Apple Update software. Whether this version will provide Boot Camp software updates is questionable.  \n", "Q: How do I get llvm-gcc to point to gcc instead of clang?

My wife and I started going to a gym recently.  We each have our own separate workouts and we listen to music through our earbuds.  We realized though that this has reduced our evening chat time, so I had this idea to \"call\" each other to idly (verbally) chat during our separate workouts at the gym.  And I was wondering if it was possible for us to listen to the same music as we chat.  I've tried a bunch of different searches, but the best I can figure is that we can make an actual phone call and listen to our own separate music.  We have unlimited plans, so that's a possibility, but I think it would really be nice if we were listening to the same music (with independent volume control, i.e. voice versus music).  Is there an app that will do this, ideally just over a local network (as opposed to making a call that routes through a cell phone tower or some internet service)?\n\nA: Short answer no. I found a link to an article that explains this.\n\nPlaying music or any other audio while on a phone call is easy:\nWhile on an active phone call, tap the Home button to get to the home\n  screen Open the Music app, find any song or podcast, and press play\n  Return to the phone call screen by tapping the green titlebar Music\n  (or any audio) plays immediately, but instead of outputting through\n  the external speakers, it will be played through the ear speaker.

I've currently got a great little HomeKit setup in my home which works perfectly even when I'm out of the house. I understand that HomeKit makes use of the Apple TV as a hub to enable remote access to my home.\nI'm considering purchasing an ExpressVPN subscription as I live abroad and would like a reliable way of accessing TV shows without having to constantly find new VPNs. I understand that ExpressVPN is unlike many other VPNs as it provides the option to add a VPN directly to the Apple TV as per these instructions.\nHowever, before jumping at the opportunity and shelling out a rather steep price every month, I thought it best to check the consequences of such a move.\nMy question is: Will my HomeKit functionality stay the same with a VPN on the Apple TV? \nIn other words, will I still be able to remote access my home kit devices while I'm out? If not, what are the limitations and are there any mitigations? If so, would there be any other unforeseen consequences of adding a VPN?\n\nA: Your VPN connection isn't really a factor since all the of the synchronization is done via iCloud.\nTo simplify this a bit, consider that to remotely control your HomeKit (via the HomeKit hub), your devices must be signed into iCloud with your AppleID.  When you're away from home, you're on a different network and control your HomeKit devices.\nA VPN is nothing more than a secure way of connecting a computer on one network to another so that it you're actually on that network (i.e. you're in Paris, France, but you VPN into a network in New York).\nSo, whether you're on a remote network or on a remote network but connected to a VPN, so long as you can sync with iCloud, you can control HomeKit devices.\n", "Q: iPhone System Storage over 50 GB \nThe extremely high system storage is making my phone unusable.

I understand that Clang is the default and recommended compiler for MacOS. By default macOS has binaries for gcc and g++ in /usr/bin/ which are same as clang and clang++.\nWhat are the possible issues (if any), if I replace the default macOS binaries for gcc and g++ binaries with the GNU versions?\n\nA: There are some possible issues with replacing the binaries:\n1) They might be re-replaced when you update macOS\n2) The binary built by gcc might work differently than one built with clang\n3) The interface for the compiler (i.e. command line options as well as other input/output files) might be different, having slightly different syntax, etc.\nIn general, if you replace the binaries and start building your own software running gcc on the command line - that will work without problem.\nThe problem is that other programs on your computer might assume that you have clang there. So installers, Xcode, etc. might suffer odd issues. Most probably this is not the case, as Xcode won't run the gcc binary, but for third party projects or older projects - it's hard to know.\nBasically: Normally it is not worth the risk to replace the system provided compiler binaries. Just add new binaries for your own compilers at the side (i.e. install them with homebrew or whatever). Then you choose to use those compilers, and everything else will behave like it did before.\nRegarding the question you had in an earlier edit of your question questing why Apple \"did this\": It is infact a common occurence on Unixoid systems to have old names for compilers actually be a front for new compilers. This is usually done to achieve compatibility with old programs. I.e. you had a project that hardcoded \"gcc\" instead of \"cc\" as the compiler name, and instead of breaking everyone's build scripts when you replace gcc with clang, you simply add a gcc binary that really runs clang. In most cases that will work producing the outputs that people expected, in some rare cases - it doesn't work, and you would have to install the older (or different) compiler yourself.\n", "Q: Cannot install graphviz with macports I am struggling with macports trying to install graphviz tool:\n... $ sudo port install graphviz\n--->  Computing dependencies for graphviz\n--->  Fetching archive for graphviz\n--->  Attempting to fetch graphviz-2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11.darwin_18.x86_64.tbz2 from https://packages.macports.org/graphviz\n--->  Attempting to fetch graphviz-2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11.darwin_18.x86_64.tbz2 from http://mse.uk.packages.macports.org/sites/packages.macports.org/graphviz\n--->  Attempting to fetch graphviz-2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11.darwin_18.x86_64.tbz2 from http://lil.fr.packages.macports.org/graphviz\n--->  Fetching distfiles for graphviz\n--->  Verifying checksums for graphviz\n--->  Extracting graphviz\n--->  Configuring graphviz\n--->  Building graphviz\n--->  Staging graphviz into destroot\n--->  Installing graphviz @2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11\n--->  Activating graphviz @2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11\n--->  Cleaning graphviz\n--->  Scanning binaries for linking errors\n--->  No broken files found.\n--->  No broken ports found.\n... $ graphviz\n-bash: graphviz: command not found\n... $ which graphviz\n... $ sudo port installed\nThe following ports are currently installed:\n...\n  graphviz @2.40.1_1+pangocairo+x11 (active)\n...\n\nLiterally have no idea what did I wrong.

I could search in the text by Search; just fine.\nNow in Books the Search in Preview gives \"No Results Found\" : for many PDFs but not for all PDFs. It works sometimes.

I don't want my Mac to make any outbound calls to any ports unless via the VPN connection. I'm trying to add a rule that allows the VPN, while everything else is blocked by set block-policy drop.\nI can connect to the VPN, but nothing works aside from that. Can you point me to the right direction?\nI can make direct changes in pf.conf too (this should not necessarily be Murus).\n\nA: Little Snitch (a highly customizable firewall for macOS) has the functionality you are looking for. \nFirst create a profile for a VPN connection. (allow all in/out traffic) Then create a second profile, which would block all in/out traffic. Lastly, set-up automatic profile switching based on the current state of connection to the VPN server. \nCheck out this guide for more info.\n\nOnce you’ve got Little Snitch’s automatic profile switching enabled,\n  it will prompt you to choose the appropriate profile when you join\n  foreign networks. You should obviously choose your untrusted profile.\n  For both your known trusted networks and your VPN connection, you\n  should configure the trusted profile to be selected. Once you’ve done\n  this, all the pieces will come together. When you are on a public\n  network, you can select the untrusted profile, and it will block all\n  traffic until you establish a VPN connection.

According to the manual, that requires the -f option, but that seems incorrect. Isn't the point of journaling that you never need a full disk check?\nIn detail, macOS started fsck automatically with -y:\n$ ps auxw|grep fsck\nroot              3792   1.1  2.3  6429668 389400   ??  U     2:09pm   0:05.10 /System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/./fsck_hfs -y /dev/disk3s2\n\nThen I interrupted the process and re-run it by hand without -y for greater control, as I usually do:\n sudo fsck_hfs /dev/disk3s2\n** /dev/rdisk3s2\n   Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-407.50.6).\n** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n   The volume name is MyPass4T-TM2\n** Checking extents overflow file.\n** Checking catalog file.\n** Checking multi-linked files.\n\nFWIW, this is on a journaled HFS+ sparsebundle, that I use for Time Machine, hosted inside an external filesystem (ExFAT).\n\nA: Great question.\nApple only journals filesystem changes and not the data, so when a full filesystem check is initiated, the catalog file, extents file, superblocks, and allocation counts are manually checked / cross checked / and optionally rebuilt or refreshed. The journal saves no time to check a volume - it only saves time if you lose power or connection when a filesystem metadata modification is being made. So, you might run fsck less often, but it doesn’t shorten the run time of fsck\nEvery single hard link is referenced / evaluated on the sending and receiving side.\nThis process is highly IO intensive, so if you have spinning disks, you could have weeks to check a 20 TB volume on a RAID if multiple disks are involved.\nOne nice benchmark is to check how many files are present on the volume in the information tab and watch Activity Monitor to see what the read and write IOPS and data rate are. Then you can compare that to the protocol (USB C and 3.0 and Thunderbolt are faster than any realistic storage you might have) so you know the progress is limited by the drive and not CPU or connection.\nIn your case, the sparsebundle adds negligible overhead, but Time Machine is the real crippler. It uses hard links so every single file may be referenced dozens or even hundreds of times. I have some Time Machine volumes that will never finish a fsck in that I won’t let then run for the weeks needed.\nInstead, I let them be read only - set them on a shelf and only ever would get files off them or wipe them when I know I don’t need any files back from them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair Time Machine sparsebundle that will no longer mount\nSome people perform heroic surgery on Time Machine data to revive it. I prefer to buy another $100 drive and start over every 6 to 18 months, adding new fresh destinations and aging out my older destinations when they get close to filling. \n", "Q: Possible to change the visibility of a column in finder with AppleScript? When I change the visible property of a Finder column to false it does not have any effect even after closing and reopening the window.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set visible of column id kind column of list view options of Finder window 1 to false\nend tell\n\nIt appears to be a bug. Any workarounds?\n\nA: I do not believe it's a bug because if you look at the AppleScript Dictionary for Finder, it shows the following for list view options as a property:\n\n\n*\n\n*list view options (list view options, r/o) : the list view options for the container window\n\n\nThe user cannot change a read only property, however there is a UI Scripting solution.\nThat said, I try to avoid UI Scripting whenever possible however, I have the daily need to open an external drive in a particular view, sorted by size and to do this a UI Scripting solution was this only choice I could find.\nI've taken the relevant example AppleScript code from it to toggle the visibility of the Kind column:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if (current view of front Finder window) is equal to list view then\n        activate\n        my toggleCheckBox(\"Kind\")\n    end if\nend tell\n\nto toggleCheckBox(thisBox)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"j\" using command down\n        tell window 1 of application process \"Finder\"\n            click checkbox thisBox of group 1\n            click button 2\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend toggleCheckBox\n\nNote that this particular UI Scripting solution does open and close the View Options for the front Finder window and is a bit of a visual distraction and one of the reasons I dislike UI Scripting however, sometimes one has no other choice to accomplish a given task. Note that I'm not saying it cannot be done any other way, just at the present time I don't know another way.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also Working with Errors.

If so, you can turn it off again with View>Disable Message Filter, or hitting Cmd-L.\n(I only found about this feature a couple of years ago when I accidentally turned it on in the default layout, then switched back to Classic layout. At that time, the filter setting carried over, but there was no indication that the filter was turned on. In High Sierra, it appears they've avoided this problem by disabling the filtering capability in Classic layout.)\n", "Q: QuickTime Player won't save edited file: The operation could not be completed I've edited an MP4 movie file in Quicktime Player Version 10.5. \nWhen I try to save the edited file, I get: The operation could not be completed.\nDoes anyone know what causes this and/or how it can be solved?\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.2 / Quicktime Player 10.5 / MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I downloaded a youtube video, opened in Quicktime to \"trim\" the video and quick time would not complete the operation. \nI ran the youtube video through Vlc Crunch (free video converter)as mp4 again and then Quicktime worked fine.\n\nA: For me, the error came as I was editing in Quick-Time by right-clicking on the imported video in the Photos app.\nOnce I dragged the video (export) to a directory, and then edited the .mp4 file, all was fine. No errors when Trimming and Saving.\n\nA: I found a workaround. It seems that QuickTime is able to handle the file via the Share feature but not the Export.\nYou can choose to share to Messages and then save the file from there, or use Shareful, a small free app that lets you enable a \"Save as\" option in the Share menu.\n\n\nA: Guyz hello, i'm on High Sierra, i have that error \"The operation could not be completed / Impossibile completare l'operazione\", it happens often when i trim / cut a downloaded .mp4 video(same happened on el capitan), i think it cause there are small problems/errors after the download of a video, also if video is well played by Quick Time / VLC.\nSo i simply copy the downloaded video and paste it in another location, example - copy from download folder and paste to desktop. Then i can save the trimmed / cutted video. I think after copy in some magic way OSX corrects those small errors.\nHope it will work for you also! Have a nice day!^^\n\nA: Not an actual answer.

I have a feeling it is related to files that have small errors (like missing keyframes, or a videotrack that is out of sync with the audiotrack).\nUnfortunately the only solution i have found thus far is re-encoding the video and trying again (using a tool like ffmpeg or Handbrake) or using editing software like Premiere Pro / iMovie / Final Cut. In both cases, you need to re-encode the video and it will take some time.\n\nA: This is an old question but I will answer it for others having the same issue. (Added note: I just realized my error is slightly different - it won't save because I don't have permission).\nI just solved it by changing the folder it's saved to. It was defaulting to my Mac hard drive and for some reason would not save there. I changed it to another folder and it saved just fine.

What prevents a re-seller from installing a root kit in the user's directory that may include a cron, or even another sub-system that would still be there after this \"clean\" install? \n\nA: Like Allan said in his comment that step specifically says\n\nOnce the USB drive has booted, select \"Disk Utility\" from the Utilities window, choose your Mac's startup drive from the list, and click \"Erase\". \n\nThis is one of the most vital steps in the process of a clean install.

Both are running the newest builds of macOS Sierra 10.12.6. The “server” machine is running macOS Server running VPN and file sharing. Both machines are connected to Gigabit Internet (1Gbps up and down) but are located thousands of miles apart. The disk read/write speeds on both ends are above 100 MBps (800Mbps).\nI connect my client to the server VPN (L2TP) and then file share over AFP. I regularly shuttle large files and folders to the server from the client. However, the highest speed I can get is 5 MBps (40 Mbps) sustained transfer, with a max peak of 12 MBps. If I’m moving files the other way (server to client), but transfers all initiated on the client machine), I can get as high as 10 MBps (80Mbps) sustained transfer. However, I can never get higher than that. Even with the VPN’s overhead, I was hoping to get a higher speed than, at most, 10% of the rated speed.\nMy questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this low speed normal for a VPN (factoring in overhead)?\n\n*What can I do to improve my transfer performance (for large files, not large folders with lots of small files)?\n\nA: AFP (like SMB) is a protocol that was designed for use in local networks. It suffers a lot from the high latencies over WAN.\nIf possible, use a protocol that was designed to tolerate high latencies, like (S)FTP. Even scp or rsync should do significantly better.\n\nA: \nBoth machines are connected to Gigabit Internet (1Gbps up and down)\nbut are located thousands of miles apart.\n\nThis doesn't mean that there is a low latency, gig pipe between your two sites, it just means there's a gig pipe from/to you and your Internet providers.  What happens after it leaves your ISPs networks is the critical part of the equation.\nProperly determining actual bandwidth\nThere is an excellent (cross platform including Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, etc.) utility called iPerf that can measure file transfer speeds between points.  For this particular test, it's actually pretty simple:\n\n*\n\n*at each end-point in your VPN, install the iPerf utility (it's just a single executable binary file)\n\n\n*on a node at one of the VPN's end-points, run iPerf as a server\n  $ iperf3 -s\n\n\n\n*on another node at the other end of the VPN, run iPerf as a client\n  $ iperf3 - c <hostname/IP>\n\nYou will then get some output similar to below (I'm doing this demo on an internal network):\n[  4] local 192.168.10.133 port 64041 connected to 192.168.10.113 port 5201\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  4]   0.00-1.00   sec   169 MBytes  1.42 Gbits/sec\n[  4]   1.00-2.00   sec  49.7 MBytes   417 Mbits/sec\n....\n[  4]   8.00-9.00   sec   192 MBytes  1.61 Gbits/sec\n[  4]   9.00-10.00  sec   186 MBytes  1.56 Gbits/sec\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bandwidth\n[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.63 GBytes  1.40 Gbits/sec                  sender\n[  4]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.63 GBytes  1.40 Gbits/sec                  receiver\n\nThis will give you an accurate bandwidth measurement accounting for everything between your two end-points: satellite up-links, firewalls, routers, etc.    The bandwidth number you get here is the number you should be looking at to evaluate your transfer speed over VPN.\nReduce Latency\nAs mentioned previously, AFP and SMB protocols don't perform well in high latency environments.  There are a few things you can do to reduce the latency of your connection:\n\n*\n\n*Prioritize VPN traffic so it's not slowed down by others using the same Internet connection\n\n*Ensure VPN traffic can use the maximum amount of bandwidth possible.  It's conceivable that your provider/network admin may be packet or traffic shaping  VPN traffic to (as you mentioned) 10% of your available bandwidth.\n\n*Turn off Finder's icons and icon previews and try to always view in List mode(CommandJ)\n\nTurn to the Cloud\nIf all else fails, a more convenient method to move files is via the cloud.  Services like OneDrive for Business gives you a secure method to access your corporate files that synchronized between servers without the latency of a VPN.  If that solution is still to small, you could light up an Azure File Sever or an AWS instance that would act as or synchronize with an on-prem server.\n", "Q: Unable to double tap on the trackpad to highlight multiple words in macOS Mojave In previous versions of OS X, I was able to \"double tap\" on the trackpad and then move my finger to the side or down to highlight/select text/multiple text.\nI'm unable to duplicate this in the new macOS Mojave.

So, I'm doing a 100+GB transfer over my LAN from my iMac to my NAS, I was simply wondering if it would utilize both the ethernet and the wifi for the transfer. If not, is there a way to enable transfers to use both?\n\nA: \nIf not, is there a way to enable transfers to use both?\n\nYes. While it is complicated (or, with cheaper devices, impossible) to do this on the link, network, or routing layers, you can use both Ethernet and Wifi by \"bundling\" your two links on the application layer easily.\nPut both your devices on Ethernet and Wifi; and make sure Ethernet/Wifi are in different subnets. Then split your 100GB of files into two sets, their size roughly corresponding to the relative speed of the two connections.\nThen, connect from the iMac to the NAS twice at the same time, once for each of the two IP addresses of the NAS. I have used a Mac one time in my life, about 20 years ago, so I have no idea how you do that, but I am still sure that it is somehow possible (in the worst case, by not mounting the NAS file system directly on the iMac, but by using something like a scp/ftp/rsync file transfer instead.\nThen transfer the two sets of files you separated earlier, one to the first IP address, the other to the other. The TCP/IP traffic will go over the respective link only, and assuming that both devices are able to handle that capacity (i.e., the drives are fast enough, no artificial bottleneck due to badly optimized network stacks, etc.), you will get a maximum performance close to the sum of the two bandwiths.\n\nA: \nDo LAN transfers use both Ethernet and WiFi by default?\n\nNo.  The default action is to use the one with the highest priority.  This is usually done by the order of the interfaces that you specify in Network Preferences.  Following that, the next order of priority is network latency.\n\nIf not, is there a way to enable transfers to use both?\n\nWhat you are referring to is called link aggregation or bonding.  Your Mac is definitely capable of doing this, however, you must connect to a switch (usually a \"smart switch\") that also has this capability.  So, unless your switch has this ability, you can't do it.\nAlso, you can't bond WiFi and Ethernet; link aggregation is for bonding Ethernet links.\n\nA: No, first priority is the wired lan. If lan is disconnected then wifi is used. \n", "Q: 3 locations for SSHd configuration So I want to harden my SSH daemon when Remote Login is enabled.\nSo far I've found:\n\n\n*\n\n*/private/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist -> protected by SIP\n\n*/etc/ssh/sshd_config\nWhy are there 3 locations, and what is the difference?\n\nA: If you look at the specific files you'll see that there are actually only two files (/etc/ssh/sshd_config and /private/etc/ssh/sshd_config is the same file unless your setup is non-standard).\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist is used by the system to start sshd, usually you don't need to change this\n\n*/private/etc/ssh/sshd_config is the global configuration file for sshd, and the place where you need to change whatever is required to harden SSH on your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Google Calendar Notification not making any sound on iPhone 6 I am on iOS 12.1.2\nI would like to use only ONE app for all my reminders and task management. \nI think Google Calendar fits the bill nicely.

However, the command dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1 count=1 didn't work for me. I can still eject the hard drive and in Disk Utility it is still listed under \"External\".\nAre there any other options to get my Mac to see my external drive as internal?\n\nA: It's not so much as recognizing if the drive is internal or not, it's whether it's removable or not.  Whether or not a drive is identified as \"removable\" is dependent on what the firmware of the external drive has set; it's called the Removable Media Bit or RMB for short. Microsoft has a good write up on this.\n\nThe removable media device setting is a flag contained within the SCSI\nInquiry Data response to the SCSI Inquiry command. Bit 7 of byte 1\n(indexed from 0) is the Removable Media Bit (RMB). An RMB set to zero\nindicates that the device is not a removable media device. An RMB of\none indicates that the device is a removable media device.\n\nBut wait; those are SCSI devices, not USB!  Actually, USB devices are seen as SCSI devices.\nSo, to do this, you have to \"flip the bit\" in the USB device's (not your Mac's) controller firmware.  Some allow you to do it, some don't.\nFlipping the Bit\nThere are several tools out there for doing this (I only know of the Windows utilities).\n\n*\n\n*Lexar BootIt\n\n*BootIce\nImportant Note:  The procedure is different for different brands of drives and you may brick your external drive as you are writing to the USB controllers firmware.\nThere are many \"Mass Production USB Prep Tools\" like Ameco available (that's a search link as I'm not providing any links to this software; use at your own risk) for download.  I don't often source quotes from discussion forums, but this one from Hak5: Collection of Production Tools for USB-devices bears repeating:\n\nWARNING : THIS IS NOT FOR NOOBS . USE AT YOUR OWN RISK & RTFM\n\nDon't take that as being new to IT or computers.  Take it as if you don't know how or have never manipulated individual bits (1s and 0s) and written them to firmware, this is not for you.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try and experiment - I fully encourage you to do so, but you shouldn't do this on a production piece of equipment you paid good money for.\nTL;DR\nDon't do this. (IMO) It's better to have Windows installed on your genuinely non-removable drive.  You don't need much to have a Windows install (I have a VM with only 40GB allocated to it).  What you can do is migrate the user profile to the external drive (mine is an iSCSI LUN from a Synology NAS).

To ensure compatibility use RAM that has the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clock Speed\n\n*Voltage Requirement\n\n*Latency timings\n\n\nIt's best to buy identical RAM sticks. They should be the same manufacturer and the same model number. Occasionally even RAM with the same model number can have different modules on the chip.

This was easy to do because I could just pass an argument for (as I recall) -background.\nDoes Terminal.app have such an interface?  I would prefer to do this via a bash script but I can cope with AppleScript if needed.\nI tend to use tabs within one Terminal window which may complicate things as well.\nI'm currently on Mojave.\n\nA: You can indeed use AppleScript to change the Terminal background color.\nFor example:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n  set background color of first window to {33717, 0, 21000, 32288}\nend tell\n\nYou can execute it from the command line with:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\"' -e 'set background color of first window to {33717, 0, 21000, 32288}' -e 'end tell'\n\n\nYou can then change more attributes:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set background color of first window to {33717, 0, 21000, 32288}\n    set cursor color of first window to \"white\"\n    set normal text color of first window to \"white\"\n    set bold text color of first window to \"yellow\"\nend tell\n\n\nTo execute this kind of longer script from the Terminal, you can save it into a separate file ~/.terminal_change_color.scpt then, call it from the terminal:\nosascript ~/.terminal_change_color.scpt\n\nYou can then add it to your ~/.bash_profile so that it executes for every new Terminal window you open:\necho \"osascript ~/.terminal_change_color.scpt\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nBelow is a longer script to choose a random background color.\nAs @nohillside noticed, you also need to adjust the text color to make it readable (white text on dark background, and black text on light backgound). The script handles that.\nglobal kColorValueMaximum\nset kColorValueMaximum to 65535\n\n-- Choose a random color for the background\nset randomRed to (random number) * kColorValueMaximum\nset randomGreen to (random number) * kColorValueMaximum\nset randomBlue to (random number) * kColorValueMaximum\nset myBackgroundColor to {randomRed, randomGreen, randomBlue}\n\n-- Select appropriate text colors based on that background\nset {myTextColor, myBoldColor} to my ContrastingTextColors(myBackgroundColor)\n\n-- Now inflict them on the frontmost window\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set targetWindow to window 1\n    set background color of targetWindow to myBackgroundColor\n    set cursor color of targetWindow to myTextColor\n    set normal text color of targetWindow to myTextColor\n    set bold text color of targetWindow to myBoldColor\nend tell\n\non ContrastingTextColors(myColor)\n    set whiteColor to {kColorValueMaximum, kColorValueMaximum, kColorValueMaximum, kColorValueMaximum}\n    set lightGreyColor to {40000, 40000, 40000, kColorValueMaximum}\n    set blackColor to {0, 0, 0, kColorValueMaximum}\n    set darkGreyColor to {20000, 20000, 20000, kColorValueMaximum}\n\n    -- From http://www.wilsonmar.com/1colors.htm\n    set myRed to (item 1 of myColor) / kColorValueMaximum\n    set myGreen to (item 2 of myColor) / kColorValueMaximum\n    set myBlue to (item 3 of myColor) / kColorValueMaximum\n    set magicY to (0.3 * myRed) + (0.59 * myGreen) + (0.11 * myBlue)\n    if (magicY < 0.5) then\n        return {whiteColor, lightGreyColor}\n    else\n        return {blackColor, darkGreyColor}\n    end if\nend ContrastingTextColors\n\n\nAlternatively, you can create like 30 themes into your Terminal Preferences > Profiles, and select one randomly:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set themes to {\"Basic\", \"Homebrew\", \"Man Page\", \"Novel\", \"Pro\"}\n    set theme to some item of themes\n    set current settings of window 1 to settings set theme\nend tell\n\n\nCredits to:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/a/1188791/955567\n\n*https://nslog.com/2006/11/02/terminal_color_changing_via_applescript\n\n*https://red-sweater.com/blog/220/random-color-terminal\n\n*https://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/mac-os-x/applescript-list-examples\n\nA: I added slightly to Yoric's spectacular answer because I prefer what I call \"pastel\" colors.  Replacing the first seven lines of his script long script with:\nglobal kColorValueMaximum\nset kColorValueMaximum to 65535\nset kColorValueRange to 32768\nset kColorValueMinimum to kColorValueMaximum - kColorValueRange\n\n-- Choose a random color for the background\nset randomRed to (random number) * kColorValueRange + kColorValueMinimum\nset randomGreen to (random number) * kColorValueRange + kColorValueMinimum\nset randomBlue to (random number) * kColorValueRange + kColorValueMinimum\n\nMaking the Range 16384, to me, was too lite.  32768 sometimes gives a slightly dark color so you might want to tweak that to suite your taste.\n", "Q: Should I create APFS encrypted disk image on hard disk drives? \nI'm about to create an encrypted sparse disk image on my HFS+ formatted hard drive, but then I wondered if APFS's drawbacks on HDDs will mean anything in this case, since the hardware is anyway on HFS+. Since the disk image is in software, I think APFS should do faster logical copying and decrypting because it's newer but I don't really know how this works.\n\nA: It's more like the benefits/features of APFS won't mean anything. A lot of it takes advantage of the fact that random (arbitrary) locations can be read from a SSD with no \"seek time\" penalties you might get in an HDD\nCreating a small disk image on a HDD might help disguise how much APFS slows down on a HDD if it's kept in one continuous piece, and the drive has a big cache, but 200GB image on a 1TB drive is only ever going to perform as well as the drive it's on minus overhead.\n", "Q: \"Sign In to iMessage\" popup randomly \nI get a random popup from an unknown program asking for my password.

I don't have iCloud configured at all.\nI tried rm -rf on Messenger.app, but it's a protected folder.\n\nA: The only way to get rid of it is to disassociate your AppleID from Messages. Merely disabling won't do it. There is no graphical interface for completely removing the AppleID from messages this.

Its a 2012 iMac which does support TDM. However, I don't have a standard iMac keyboard because I bought a refurbished Mac which comes with a different keyboard & mouse. That being said, I can't use the Command + F2 key combination to go into TDM. How am I able to without doing that?\n\nA: Have you tried all the  steps recommended by Apple?\nUse Target Display Mode\nFollow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:\n1   Make sure that your iMac is turned on, and the other Mac is logged in to a macOS user account.\n2   Connect the Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable between the two computers.\n3   Press Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display.\n\nAfter you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from the connected Mac.\nIf Command-F2 doesn't work\nIf your iMac doesn't switch to Target Display Mode when you press Command-F2, check these things:\n•   Make sure that the iMac you're trying to use as a display supports Target Display Mode. \n•   Target Display Mode works only when your primary Mac is logged in to a macOS user account. For example, if your first Mac is at the FileVault login screen, pressing Command-F2 on your iMac does not enable Target Display Mode. You must first log in to your Mac (using a regular display, if necessary) before you can use an iMac in Target Display Mode.\n•   Make sure that you're pressing Command-F2 on the keyboard that's connected to the iMac you want to use as a display.\n•   In Keyboard System Preferences, if the checkbox is enabled for \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,\" the key combination changes to Command-Fn-F2.\n•   Make sure that your Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable is connected to both computers.\n•   If you're currently logged in on the iMac you want to use as a display, try logging out to return to the login window. Then press Command-F2 again.\n•   Some older Apple keyboards and third-party keyboards might not allow Command-F2 to toggle display modes. If this happens, use the keyboard that came with your iMac to toggle Target Display Mode on and off. \n•   If your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target Display Mode. Target Display Mode isn't supported in Boot Camp.\n\n\nA: If you are using a keyboard set up for Windows, EG a Windows logo key to the left and/or right of the space bark That is your Command key.\nSo pressing WindowsF2 should do what you want.\n", "Q: Connect Xbox to iMac I am trying to connect my xbox to my iMac using a Thunderbolt HDMI adapter. One end is an HDMI port, which I plugged my xbox HDMI cord into and then I plugged the Thunderbolt into my computer\n\n\n*\n\n*The Xbox works on a TV using an HDMI cord.\n\n*Early 2013 iMac \n\n*macOS Mojave 10.14.2\n\n*AmazonBasic mini DP to HDMI\nHowever, when I press Command F2, nothing happens. It just makes a sound like its saying \"no\" or whatever, like the incorrect sound.\nIs there another way to go into Target Display or is there a program that I need to actually view the screen on my Mac?\nTarget Display Mode just isn't popping up, so I've already tried it. What else can I do?\n\nA: A cheaper alternative to using cables and adapters is OneCast which allows you to stream your Xbox to your Mac(costs $20).\n\n\nA: The short answer is no, since the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter is one way. You will need an active adapter to ingest the HDMI and output (mini) Display-port if Apples documentation is wrong. Your model is listed as only supporting thunderbolt in, but sometimes undocumented things work (like extra ram or refresh rates more than advertised.)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-HDMI2DP-DisplayPort-Active-Converter/dp/B004I6IYSM/\nThis is mostly explained in the Apple documentation on target mode display where you have to feed it an actual thunderbolt signal or an actual DisplayPort signal. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592\nEverything else points to this working if you got a different adapter, but I’d be sure you can return the active adapter if you can’t confirm it will work before buying. They are around $100 for good quality adapters and maybe $45 for the lesser expensive. Shop carefully, the A to B direction is crucial as you now see; as is whether you have an active or passive adapter. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/DisplayPort-Adapter-FOINNEX-Converter-Compatible/dp/B07G796JF8/\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to remotely access my own computer? Without Back to My Mac, what's the best way to access my own computer remotely?\nApple's Screen Sharing app requires confirmation from the host.\nChrome Remote Desktop also requires a token to be generated from the host.\nIn other words, I'd like to remotely control my own computer from another Mac, when I'm not home.\n\nA: I was trying for a few days to get ARD to work on a remote computer running macOS Mojave, any other OS was fine just not Mojave. I found a link on the web suggesting it doesn't work as it used to and might require user(s) to open up screen sharing for you. That of course doesn't work when you are supporting many computers remotely.\nWhat I was able to do to fix my problem was to VPN into the remote network, SSH into the computer and modify these 2 plists:\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.remotemanagement.plist \nand\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.remotedesktop.plist\nusing my computers plists as a reference. Once they were modified I moved them back to the remote computer and then ran a repair on disk permissions. Rebooted the computer remotely and it worked for me. I certainly hope this is a fix (a very unnecessary fix I must say). Give it a go.\n\nA: As Apple dropped support for Back to My Mac, here are some suggestions and resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Remote Desktop over the internet on Ask Different  \n\n*Apple Remote Desktop on the App Store\n\n*Prepare for changes to Back to My Mac Apple Support Document  \n\n*Edovia Screens for macOS\nFor screen sharing or the Apple Remote Desktop App, you'd need to set up port forwarding. \nThe screens app is probably a good alternative. \n\nA: I've had lots of success accessing my iMac at home using the Apple Screen Sharing app and connecting to it using Zero Tier. As it's a direct connection there no confirmation needed, i.e., if you connect via Messages.\nI have no affilation with Zero Tier. I just like it alot as it solves many problems with remote connections, e.g., same subnet, NAT transversal, etc.\nZero Tier\nZero Tier is a 'virtual switch' that creates private encrypted networks which also deals  well with getting through routers with NAT/firewall; no manual port forwarding required. If you're behind a home/domestic router (rather than a corporate firewall) there's a high probably it'll work for you.\nThe basic setup involves:\n\n*\n\n*Signup for a free account https://www.zerotier.com/\n\n*Signin and create a private network using Networks: https://my.zerotier.com/network\n\n*Download and install the client software on each machine\n\n*Join the private network on each machine\n\n*Authorise each machine after it appears in Networks: https://my.zerotier.com/network\nOnce the machines are authorised they are assigned an IP address in one of the reserved private ranges, e.g. 10.63.28.188. You can choose a range that does not conflict with anything you may be using already. The private IP is then used to connect to the other machine.\nScreen Sharing\nOn the destination machine, make sure Screen Sharing is enabled in the Sharing panel\nSystem Preferences > Sharing > Screen Sharing\n\nAlternatively: Enable Screen Sharing via SSH: How to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH?\nConnect via Finder\nWith Zero Tier the machines are on the same private network so the destination machine should appear in Finder, you can then click on it and press the Share Screen button to connect.\nManual connect\nOpen the Apple Screen Sharing app then enter the private IP address of the destination machine:\n\nClick Connect then you'll be prompted for the login credentials of the destination machine if it has sussessfully made the connection, and once authenticated you'll be presented with the destination machine desktop.\nI hope this helps someone!\napple-screen-sharing zero-tier\n", "Q: Unable to block contact on iMessage for Mac OS 10.14.2 I am unable to block a contact on my mac's iMessage app (Mac OS 10.14.2).\nI go to preferences > imessage > blocked > + , and then a drop down of my contacts appears.

Example: I'm playing a game and stop for a minute to send a message on WhatsApp. Lock the phone for a couple a minutes, and when I navigate through \"frozen\" apps and select the game (the game still has the last screen it had when it was minimized), it opens from the splash screen, reseted!\nAnd it doesn't happen only with games. Even Facebook, Twitter, and other apps.\n\nA: You can‘t change that, only the app developer can (by adding code to handle the unloading of the app and preserving the state). Most games don‘t, unfortunately. \n\nA: This is actually a common misconception in iOS.\nApps are not \"minimized\": they are suspended while they're in the background (except in some cases, notably navigation and music apps). Further, resource taxing suspended apps (such as games) are often closed entirely shortly after being suspended so that iOS can reclaim the copious amounts of memory these apps often reserve.\nThe answer to this issue, as @nohillside mentioned, is that the developer needs to implement functionality to save the state of the game when it is suspended, then restore the suspended state when the app wakes up again.\nThis can be tricky for many applications, but especially games. So many games simply don't do it.\nThere is nothing that you can do as a user to change this functionality, as these constraints are enforced upon the game by the phone's iOS operating system, which is in turn constrained by the phone hardware.\n\nA: From my experience, there was two occasions where apps doesn't keep running(or, in other words, shows splash screen when I launch it again).\nFirst one is that the developer poorly, or even didn't implement suspending for the app. There were some apps that always quits when I press home button, or resets when it was on specific feature. (Although in recent app store I haven't seen one except for some public institution apps that have 1~2 average review)\nSecond one is hardware limitation - even though the developer properly implemented the suspension feature, iOS sometimes decide to quit it, for various reasons from lack of memory(this is actually major reason that earlier idevices didn't support app suspension on 3G/S era), battery time management.\nFor first reason, you can write a review on Appstore - it is one of the most impacting reasons for app development progress.\nFor second reason, well, it is kinda dumb solution but you can purchase a new hardware with more RAM, and it will reduce the possibility of suspended apps halted from iOS(And reduce time for app relaunch). Or, if you're not willing to do so, you can tell iOS to halt some unimportant apps by swiping the app's preview upwards in the multitasking view, possibly reducing the chance of the apps you're actually using getting killed by iOS.\n", "Q: Starting from March 2019, is it necessary to build all existing apps using iOS 12 SDK and Xcode 10 for it to work on iOS 12 devices? This is what the apple developer website says.\n\nStarting March 2019, all new apps and app updates for iPhone, including universal apps, will need to be built with the iOS 12 SDK and support iPhone XS Max. All new apps and app updates for Apple Watch will need to be built with the watchOS 5 SDK and support Apple Watch Series 4\n\nDoes it mean that even the apps already available on Apple App Store needs to be resubmitted with iOS 12 SDK build for it to work on iOS 12 devices starting march 2019?\nAnd what about enterprise apps that are distributed as .ipa files? Will this also need to be rebuilt with iOS 12 SDK for it to work on iOS 12 devices?\n\nA: The key words in this announcement are \"new apps and app updates\".\nApps which are already available on the App Store do not need to be rebuilt with the new SDK. Apps which were built with earlier SDKs will remain available on the App Store, and will still be usable on devices. However, after March 2019, the developers of those apps will need to rebuild their apps with the iOS 12 SDK to release any further updates.\n", "Q: Can I set up Boot Camp in a headless mac pro? I have this headless Mac Pro in the living room. I access it from my MBP through the network, ssh and sometimes with a remote desktop solution. I use it to run data/computing.\nNow I need to get Windows in; there's a piece of software that's only available there. To avoid virtualization drawbacks, I'm thinking of setting up a dual system like Boot Camp, but I've never done it, much less without a monitor.\nIs it doable? (setting it up without a screen)\n\nA: \nIs it doable? (setting it up without a screen)\n\nNo. Installing Boot Camp will reboot the system into the Windows installer. You will need to see the screen to complete the installation. Any remote desktop software you've set up in macOS will be unavailable in Windows, including during the Windows install process.\n", "Q: Why can I open a connection on port 80 for 0.0.0.0 but not other forms? My understanding of Linux/MacOS (I think they are the same in this regard) port permissions is that ports 1-1024 are only available to root, but above that, they are available to anyone.\nHowever, I've run into some unexpected behavior when opening ports on MacOS 10.14.2. I'm using php -S (version 7.3.0) to experiment.\nWhen I run the command with the following cases:\n127.0.0.1:80\n[::1]:80\nmylocalipv4:80\nmylocalipv6:80\n\nit returns Failed to listen on ::1:80 (reason: Permission denied) as expected (where the IP/port given is shown).\nHowever, if I run it with 0.0.0.0:80, it successfully starts listening, but I can't connect to it with curl, either using 127.0.0.1 or the actual IP of my machine.\nIf I run the PHP server with [::0]:80 it successfully starts listening, and I can curl it with curl [::1] and with my local ipv6 address.\nI would have expected the last two cases to fail to start with permission denied. Why don't they?\n\nA: From testing I can see that it is possible for a desktop macOS users to bind() TCP port numbers below 1024 (the so-called well-known ports). It works on both IPv4 and IPv6, and on the localhost/unspecified addresses.\nThe Darwin kernel source code is freely available - from there I can see that it has the functionality built-in to check for processes trying to bind/listen on ports <1024 and deny that. This is similar to the way Linux works. However, it is possible to disable this check when compiling the kernel by defining \"IPNOPRIVPORTS\". I assume this is what was done with the Mojave supplied kernel.\nOn Linux it used to be the case that it wasn't possible for non-root to bind low port numbers, but today you have various options of allowing non-root users to bind to low numbered ports. Such as for example using the capability NET_BIND_SERVICE.\nOn macOS you also have various options for restricting binding low-numbered ports. For example through kexts that does socket filtering, or through other means. Perhaps you have software installed, such as for example Little Snitch, that denied you permission when you were testing.\nPlease note that the various IP-addresses you have tried with have entirely different meanings:\n 127.0.0.1 = IPv4 address that means the \"localhost\" (i.e. your own computer basically) - it is not available on the network\n [::1]     = the IPv6 equivalent of 127.0.0.1\n\n 0.0.0.0   = IPv4 \"unspecified address\" - i.e. this is not an address in itself, rather it is a special value you give to bind() to let it know that you haven't specified a specific address that you want the port bind() on. Essentially this means that the port will be bound on all the IP-addresses you have.\n [::0]     = IPv6 equivalent of 0.0.0.0 (though usually written [::/128])\n\nThis can explain why some things failed and some things succeeded. For example you might not be able to bind to 127.0.0.1, but 0.0.0.0 works as it tries to bind the port not only on 127.0.0.1 but also on other IP-addresses you have.\n", "Q: Blank lines appearing in a CSV exported from Excel, only on 1 Mac, other Macs don't see them My colleague and I both use Macbook Pros on the latest Mac OS.\nHe exports CSV files from MS Excel for Mac and sends them to me, but when I receive them I open them in a text editor and there are blank lines on every other line.\nWeirdly though, when he opens the same file on his machine in the same text editor, he does not see blank lines. Which makes me wonder if this is a setting on his machine.\nI know Windows and Mac treat line endings differently, but we are both on a Mac. And Sublime should be the same on both machines.\nWhen I upload them to our linux server, linux agrees with me (our scripts see blank lines in the CSVs and have to be ignored).\nHe is creating CSVs using the UTF-8 format.\n\nA: If you look at your file with od -cx you will notice that every lines is terminated by the sequence: 0x0d 0x0a i.e. a carriage return followed by a newline.\nThere is most probably a difference between your 2 Sublime Text preferences in their way to manage the carriage return.\nThe next best explanation is a difference in extension you gave on your 2 text files which set Sublime Text in a different way to manage the character carriage return == 0x0d (coming from the last century type writers).\n", "Q: Numbers not sorting dates correctly I cannot get the column to sort the dates correctly in Numbers!

The problem:\nI recently got a 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro running MacOS 10.14.2 (Mojave).  I'm running into a really long freeze when I bring it out of a long sleep (e.g. by opening the lid after keeping it in a bag overnight).  Here are the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer will wake up and display the login screen.  However, the password textbox is grayed out and does not say \"enter password\" and the menu bar widgets (such as battery, wifi, and the clock) are not displayed.\n\n*Keyboard and trackpad are initially unresponsive for several minutes.\n\n*Usually, the touchbar is on and the fn key can change the mode, but none of the softkeys have any effect.  Though, a few times the fn key has had no effect changing the touchbar mode during some part of the freeze.\n\n*Eventually the colorful spinning beachball cursor will appear, but the computer remains unresponsive.  The beach ball will usually start frozen and not spinning, but start spinning a few minutes later.\n\n*After 5-10 total minutes of waiting, the computer becomes responsive, password textbox becomes active, menu bar widgets are shown, and I can finally unlock it.\n\n*Some of the time, the keyboard modifier keys get remapped to the defaults (I swap control and command because I also use Windows).\n\n*Once during a freeze, the system crashed and rebooted.  The crash report listed the OS as Bridge OS 3.3 (16P3133) and the panic message was userspace panic: remoted connection watchdog expired, no updates from  remoted monitoring thread in 75 seconds.\n\n\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*Resetting the SMC (using both methods in the comment below)\n\n*Repeatedly hitting keys in frustration during the freezes\n\n*Resetting the PRAM\n\n*Reinstalling the OS (in a way that kept all my data and apps)\n\n*Reinstalling JAMF (apparently a newer version that's supposed to have fewer issues with Sierra)\n\n*Wiping the disk and reinstalling the OS\n\n*Getting the logic board and \"touch id board\" replaced at the Apple store under warranty, and reinstalled from a Time Machine backup.  However, some people in this thread said their Bridge OS crashing issues were only resolved after several replacements.\n\n\nNone of these things have helped with the freezing problem.\n\nSystem Information:\nOS: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS Mojave 10.14.2 (and 10.14.3 and 10.14.5)\n\n\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018, MacBookPro15,1) \n\n*Graphics: Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB, as well as an AMD Radeon Pro 560X 4096MB that seems to be rarely active\n\n*Memory: 16 GB \n\n\nMajor Peripherals:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kensington SD5200T Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station (archive link), connected via Thunderbolt 3\n\n*Apple wireless keyboard and trackpad, which are configured but off since I haven't switched over to using this Mac\n\n*Powered USB hub attached to the dock, with a Time Machine disk attached.\n\n\nOther major software: \n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels Desktop 14 for Mac Business Edition 14.1.0 (45387)\n\n*Jamf\n\n*Docker Desktop 2.0.0.2 (30215)\n\n*Office 2016/Office 365\n\n*FileVault encryption enabled (via Jamf policy)\n\n*Trend Micro Security 3.0.3044 (via Jamf policy)\n\n*Time Machine backup configured, using a HD connected to the docking station.\n\n\nA: I managed to solve my issue by downgrading from Mojave to High Sierra (using this procedure).  It was very difficult to do, and I was very unsure if Apple would let me downgrade, but once I did it the freezing issue went away.\nI've had coworkers inform me that they've recently upgraded to Mojave with no problems, so whatever issue I encountered may be fixed.

I am seriously considering moving from my Android TV-based player to Apple TV player, because my current solution fails completely on playing / streaming videos from from an external server through SMB or FTP protocol with external subtitles.\nSome software players (i.e. VLC) can browse network shares (some can't), but all of them fails on opening external subtitles, i.e. stored in the .srt or .txt file with exactly the same filename as corresponding video file. It is only possible to display subtitles, if they are embedded into video files that supports embedded subtitles (i.e. MKV) or subtitles downloaded from OpenSubtitles.org.\nThis is especially weird, because happens only on SMB / FTP protocol. When using exactly the same player on local disk, everything works just like a charm.\nI'd like to ask how does it work in case of Apple TV?\nWhile searching the Internet, I managed to learn that Apple TV can play content from local network (don't know, if using SMB or FTP protocol), using VLC or some other players.

So I got an e-mail from Apple which says:\n\nYou recently requested a password reset for your Apple ID. To complete\n  the process, click the link below. Reset now > If you didn’t make this\n  change or if you believe an unauthorized person has accessed your\n  account, go to iforgot.apple.com to reset your password immediately.\n  Then sign into your Apple ID account page at https://appleid.apple.com\n  to review and update your security settings. Apple Support\n\nI didn't request any such password, and I already know my password, but when I try to log into my account to check my security settings it wants me to answer two security questions, neither of which I recognize.  So I go to try to change my security questions at the \"iforgot\" domain, and it says:\n\nChoose a method to reset your security questions.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Use credit card information Enter the details for the card on file\n  with Apple. Your card will not be charged.    \n  \n*Answer your current security questions Answer the question(s) you chose when you created your Apple ID.\n  \n\nThe problem is, I obviously can't use the second method because since I don't recognize the questions, I can't know the answers.  But I also don't know what credit card Apple is asking for here.  I may have used more than one card with Apple in stores, but I don't recall if I have ever used one online, and in fact I may have used a \"throw-away\" number.\nSo I'm not sure what to do here.  Is my account under attack?  How can I get control of my account back?\n\nA: I would absolutely follow the “if you did not request this” instructions to the letter. Since you may have difficulty with security questions or past purchases, I would open a support case with Apple and take good notes what you trying anything seems odd.\nJust be sure you don’t click the links in the mail - it’s getting hard to tell the scam mails from the real ones if you just look at font and spelling and not the address that links open. \nNavigate to apple support site from https://apple.com\nThe main problem is if you don’t keep good records of all your security information when you signed up, you might need to be patient and dig up app purchases, review old credit cards systematically and work with support. \nA typo in a year is something a computer won't validate and you know the year you were born, just that might not be what the keyboard typed. Worse, if you made up answers or answered the correct question in the wrong field (answer in the field above the question instead of below the question), you could easily lock yourself out.\nThat ends the thing you control, here are things you don't control:\nThere’s no way you can prevent someone else from trying to lock your account initially or even take it over. Until you validate to Apple support that you are the owner of the account, the account could be \"flagged\" for extra security. Hopefully it is just someone that is confused and not someone maliciously trying to make your life miserable. \n\nA: I'm not sure if clicking on the \"Use credit card information\" choice would have led to this because what I wound up doing was trying to guess what the answers to my security questions could be.  After a few times it said I had tried too many times and could either wait until later or reset the questions.  From this page, when I clicked on the button to reset the questions it immediately took me to a page showing the last four digits of a card that I did recognize.  So I'm going to chalk this up to confusing design, as the original page did not suggest that it was going to help me with a reminder of which card was being asked for, causing me to get stuck on the page.\n", "Q: How do I fix a blurry arrow in an alias icon?

I was able to solve this problem by going to \"Show View Options\" (Right Click on Desktop Space) and adjusting the icon size. You can set it back to the size you had it originally but somehow making an adjustment refreshes the screen and the arrows come back sharp and clear. \nBefore I discovered this I tried making icons different resolution sizes thinking the arrow was trying to \"match\" pixel resolution - but that apparently isn't the case. I would have used the \"change icon file name\" but somehow I wasn't able to get \"system\" approval even though I'm the admin. \n\nA: I have the same problem. I figured out that the arrow is ok if the icon is not set as a perfect square, otherwise the arrow tends to go blurry. But again - there is a problem with the icon when it's not a perfect square. But there is good news too, it can be fixed in quite a strange way - just move the alias to the trash and somehow the arrow becomes normal after a couple of hours or after restart. Don't know for sure, just keep in the trash for a while and it will fix this blurry problem. :)\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it!

You can define one by putting the following into your .bashrc\npbedit() {\n    local _t=$(mktemp)\n    chmod 600 \"$_t\"\n\n    pbpaste > \"$_t\"\n    ${EDITOR:-vi} \"$_t\"\n    pbcopy < \"$_t\"\n\n    rm -f \"$_t\"\n}\n\nThis tries to minimize the risk of other people accessing the temporary file while editing (but can't prevent anybody with admin or root priviledges from access).\n", "Q: How to enter various nvram boot-args I'd like to set both vm_compression=1 plus serverperfmode=1.

In lack of information - Google didn't help me - does anyone know about possible new capabilities regarding NFC functionality on iPhone with iOS12?\nThere were several rumours that iOS12 will have a larger scope for using NFC on iPhone than just Apple Pay.\nBackground: I'm interested using the iPhone for unlocking our company's door than using those lousy rfid tags. But my interest is not limited on this scenario.  \n\nA: Basically two new NFC features were released - however they are only available on select newer phones, so there's not really any change if you have an older phone.\nThe new features are available on iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR.\nFeature 1: Express Card\nThis makes it possible for the phone to work as a NFC card for stuff like student cards, entry cards, transportation tickets - when the battery is dead! The idea is that even when the phone is shut down due to lack of battery, the phone can still be used as a valid NFC card for approx. 5 hours.\nThe feature is only available for (few) select cards that are stored in the Wallet.\nFeature 2: Background Tag Reading\nThe phone is now always \"listening\" for NFC tags. You can read a tag without unlocking your phone, and it will show a small notification that you can activate to go into the app that is registered to handle that type of NFC tag.\nPreviously you had to open the app first, and then read the tag.\n\nA: CoreNFC framework has been introduced in iOS 11 for detection of NFC tags and reading NDEF info.\nSee Apple dev documentation for more information.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc\n", "Q: \"whatis\" returns 0 for missing commands On macOS 10.14, using whatis on a command that is not installed prints 'command': nothing appropriate as is expected.

This is on an Early 2011 Macbook Pro 17\" with i7 2.2ghz and the Intel + Radeon HD6750: \n\nIf it is a screen error then I don't mind fixing it myself, but if the GPU is the problem, I'm worried I might have to buy a new logic board assuming I can't use the GPU.\n\nA: The folder with the question mark means it cannot find a bootable system.\nThat said, because it can display that image, then I would think it is a screen problem - does it show signs of being bent or having dents in it...\nAre you sure of your skills to do the necessary repairs or is this a \"throwaway\" project...\n\nA: That’s a hard one. It could really be either. \n\n\n*\n\n*not the operating system since it’s just the firmware running \n\n*it’s less likely it’s the GPU when you see an issue before the OS loads, but it still could be the GPU. \n\n*it’s more likely the LCD or cabling when there is clear, crips vertical defects\n\n\nSo the tie goes to LCD failure and not GPU if I was forced to guess, but I wouldn’t guess with my money. I would meet the seller with an external display so that you can evaluate before you pay.  Or set two prices - the price you pay if it’s the GPU and the price you pay if it's not the GPU. The seller has more information than you, so you don’t want to get taken advantage of. Similarly, you also can’t waste the sellers time if you’re not going to make a legitimate offer once you understand the condition of the goods. \n\nA: The best way to determine if the vertical bar is due to the screen is to boot the Mac into an operating system and take a screenshot.\nIf the vertical bar still appears in the actual screenshot, then you know it's related to something else (e.g. the GPU, etc). If it's not there, it's a problem with the screen.\nAnother option you could try is to test the hardware by running Apple Hardware Test over the internet.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart the MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the option and D keys before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button.

Odd thing is, after it’s been hard reset it won’t turn back on unless it’s plugged into a charger (despite it being at 78%) it will just flash the white Apple logo every 5-10 seconds or so. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Try restore it through iTunes. First of ALL you should back it up using iTunes or iCloud. If you own an iMac , iTunes app is a built one. \nIf you don’t have a Mac download iTunes app to your computer and make an iTunes account. \nThen connect your iPhone to your Mac/windows PC - login to your iTunes account - back it up - when backup is complete, Restore it (there is a RESTORE button ).\nThis way your issue will be resolved IMO.

She can text me, but I cannot reply as a text message. On her \"Send & Receive\" there is no \"check\" on her phone number but rather a loading sign beside it that doesn't seem to go away. \n\nA: Create a new message from your iPhone and pick his phone number as the receiver (do not use the existing conversation).\nThen when you send him a message the option should become available.\nThe reason you cannot send your messages as text messages is because he probably messaged you with his email-address as the sender, not his phone number.\n\nA: Try resetting your date and time settings.  Go to Settings>General>Date & Time>Turn off 'Set Automatically' and then turn it back on.  That worked for me.\n\nA: I was having the same issue until I figured out if the conversation is an iMessage conversation with a persons iCloud address, the option to send as SMS will not show up.

I have recently found that FileVault is disabled on my machine. Although I remember that I set \"encrypt\" option when I was setting the machine up.\nI opened System Preferences and enabled FileVault. To my surprise it didn't take any time. I didn't have to wait while the data is encrypted. It just got instantly enabled.\nMy configuration: MacBook Air 2018, 256Gb SSD, macOS Mojave 10.14.1\nI understood that the disk is not encrypted because I was able to access the content from my home directory from a guest session. \nHow does it possible that turning on FileVault doesn't take any time?\n\nA: Yes yours is instant since your Mac has an SSD and T2 chip so all data on it is encrypted always.\nAny election you make in FileVault just adds and removes user keys from the trust chain so that happens basically instantly. However, when a FileVault credentialed user isn’t created, the system unlocks itself so the encryption door is always wide open.\nThe next time you restart, the system will notice that the first per-user key is now active and change the boot process so that the system won't unlock that storage and start the OS until your key unlocks the storage. Keep in mind, FileVault by default on APFS is all or nothing. When you unlock the storage, any account can read any files it has permission and you need your password to keep other users (guests) off your files and session.\nYou can inspect this by looking at diskutil apfs list to examine each  APFS containers and synthesized volume encryption and lock status.\nmac:~ me$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         250.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +250.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Mac                     191.7 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 65.4 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                1.0 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      3.2 GB     disk1s4\n\nBe sure to restart your machine and test the guest session scenario again.

It will free up space only when needed, so large wired alone is no worry.\n\n*You have no growth of swap space to speak of - so there's no runaway memory leak.\n\n*The pressure graph is green so the system knows it can toss all sorts of cached memory and objects if a program needs more RAM and no requests are being slowed or denied.\n\n*Wired isn't typically that high in my workloads, but more data is needed to know if that's causing any issues.\n\n\nHowever, there are specific tools and a process to pin down exactly what process(es) have allocated wired memory as well as to watch real time the virtual memory statistics using vm_stat to validate my hunch / opinion (I don’t have enough data to be certain) that things are fine here.\nIn addition to my answer linked above - these threads are relevant for how wired memory used to work Lion and expecially 10.6 and older OS X. On the latest macOS, I’m not convinced excess wired is a problem anymore, but I’d love to help investigate if anyone can reproduce this case here with 90% or more of total memory being reported as Wired.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is wired memory?\n\n*Why might more memory be wired in safe mode than in normal mode?\n\n*Why does free + active + inactive + speculative + wired not equal total RAM?\n", "Q: Emojis appear on some parts of apps but show as question mark in other parts For example, on Messages.app, the sidebar with recent contact list displays Emojis but the message pane does not:\n\nIn Safari, some Emojis appear on sites but not other sites.

I use a HD with a caddy adapter for saving some files. macOS attributes a unique identifier for each external drive connected. But I needed to swap my adapter for the same disk, and now it's not mounting because the identifier is not unique:\n\nerror USBMSC Identifier (non-unique) on console.\n\nIn the past, for the same problem, I deleted the drive label/id/something - I don't remember now - on a folder, and my drive would mount normally again when I reconnected it. \nDoes anyone know what it is I would have done on the folder to correct these IDs in the past?\nAdditional Info:\n\n\n*\n\n*The disk is recognized by macOS internet recovery > Disk Utility \n\n*If I put the drive and try to open Disk Utility on currently installed\nmacOS, it hangs and doesn't load. \n\n*the disk is showed at command diskutil list, but fails to mount using diskutil mountDisk -t Apple_HFS /dev/disk2 /Volumes/Home\n\n*If I change the drive name on Internet Recovery and connect it to the macOS installed, it's recognized on the first time, but not on a second.\n\n\nIt's purely a mistake with unique id, and I know it could be resolved by deleting this id or a label, but I wasn't able to find the article with the solution I used previously. I cannot erase the disk because it has some important files, and the drive is working normally. The problem is in the system.\n\nA: I finally remembered: the disk is mounted on /dev, but in this case, not on /Volumes.

But, as said, it only worked for the first time I connected the disk after renaming. \nSo, I repeated the renaming, copied my files and formatted it. \nFor avoiding futures annoyances, I decided to use NTFS instead of APFS, because the files on this disk could be used as read-only by me on macOS, and, if I need, exchange files using a Windows virtual machine.\n", "Q: Control volume of individual apps on iOS I would like to independently adjust the volume of Google Music and an interval timing app. The only app I see is VolumePanel but you need to jail break your phone. Is there anything available for the stock OS? \nAlso, this is not a duplicate of this question, as that solution only applies to Mac OS.\n\nA: Unfortunately no, the only volumes that could be changed separately are media volume and ringer volume, which is also alarm volume. \nThere are, though, possibly tweaks with jailbreak, but the one you mentioned is pretty outdated and will either just not work or cause bigger problems. Search among tweaks released or updated starting at least from March 2018.\n\nA: There is nothing that allows you to control the volume of specific apps in the stock OS. \nIn some apps there could be an option in Settings to manually adjust the volume but that depends if the app developer implements it. This way it will adjust the volume of that specific app.\nYou could send feedback to a specific developer if they do not have it or jailbreak. If you jailbreak you loose your warranty:\n\nWhile the jailbreaking process was ruled legal in 2010, Apple was very clear that doing so voids your warranty.

I like that Chrome asks you to hold \"Cmd-Q\" to quit. Is there a way to do this for every app on a Mac?\n\nA: You can do this by installing and running Hammerspoon, then including the following Lua code in the Hammerspoon configuration file (.hammerspoon/init.lua):\n-- config: number of seconds to hold Command-Q to quit application\ncmdQDelay = 2\n\ncmdQTimer = nil\ncmdQAlert = nil\n\nfunction cmdQCleanup()\n  hs.alert.closeSpecific(cmdQAlert)\n  cmdQTimer = nil\n  cmdQAlert = nil\nend\n\nfunction stopCmdQ()\n  if cmdQTimer then\n    cmdQTimer:stop()\n    cmdQCleanup()\n    hs.alert(\"quit canceled\",0.5)\n  end\nend\n\nfunction startCmdQ()\n  local app = hs.application.frontmostApplication()\n  cmdQTimer = hs.timer.doAfter(cmdQDelay, function() app:kill(); cmdQCleanup() end)\n  cmdQAlert = hs.alert(\"hold to quit \" .. app:name(), true)\nend\n\ncmdQ = hs.hotkey.bind({\"cmd\"},\"q\",startCmdQ,stopCmdQ)\n\nChange the value of cmdQDelay to fit your preference.\nA brief explanation:\nThe final line tells Hammerspoon to intercept any presses of Command-Q. It will run the lua function named startCmdQ when the key is pressed, and stopCmdQ when it is released.\nstartCmdQ takes a note of the foreground app, then starts a timer. If the timer times out, the function given as argument to the timer is called. It kills the app (really, asks it to quit) and cleans up after the action.\nstopCmdQ stops the timer if it is still running, so the application is not quit after all. It too cleans up afterwards.\nThe action is accompanied by alerts to let you know what is going on.\nEdit: Once this is installed and active, you can turn it off by running cmdQ:disable() in the hammerspoon console. Turn it back on with cmdQ:enable(). And if you want to excempt some apps from the delay treatment, you can add a test for those apps in the startCmdQ function, opting to run app:kill() immediately instead of starting the timer.\nEdit the second: A word of caution. This will let you quit the Finder. Don't panic, though. The easiest way to relaunch Finder is to click on its icon in the Dock. Or you can use Spotlight: Open it via the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar or its keyboard shortcut and type “Finder.app”, then return. (You will only need to type a few letters, as Spotlight will fill in the rest for you). You can also relaunch Finder by running the command hs.application.open(\"Finder\") in the hammerspoon console, or open -a Finder in a Terminal window, if you happen to have Terminal running.\n\nA: If you want this behavior because you are afraid you'll accidentally press ⌘Q while trying to press something similar (usually ⌘W or perhaps ⌘Tab), then you can remap the ⌘Q shortcut to a similar but harder-to-press shortcut, let's say to ⌥⌘Q.\nTo do this, you'll need either 1) a way to remap ⌘Q to ⌥⌘Q, or 2) block ⌘Q and set ⌥⌘Q to quit apps.\nMethod 1: remap ⌘Q to ⌥⌘Q\nMethod 1a: Using System Preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*For each app individually you want to do this in, create a shortcut which has trigger ⌥⌘Q and action Quit x where x is the name of the app. For example, for Safari I'd write \"Quit Safari\" (without quotes). Note that if this isn't working you might need to check what the name of the app is in the menu bar item.\n\n\nMethod 1b: Using Karabiner Elements or something similar\nThis should remove the limitation of manually having to set the shortcut for all apps. This is likely possible with the powerful tool Karabiner Elements but unfortunately I'm not fluent enough in it to say how.\nAs mentioned by Harald Hanche-Olsen in the comments, Hammerspoon may also let you do this, although you will need to look into it a bit more. \nMethod 2: block ⌘Q and set ⌥⌘Q to quit\nThe only reason I'm including a third-party app here is that it should be possible to do with using BTT globally, but due to a bug (?) you'll need to do this individually for all apps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install BetterTouchTool (paid but has a 45-day trial)\n\n*Create a global keyboard shortcut with ⌘Q set to do nothing\n\n*Create a global keyboard shortcut with ⌘Q set to the action Menu Bar Item, and set this as the description: x;Quit x where x is the name of the app. Again note you might need to check what it actually says in the app you want to do this for.\n\n\nI was hoping you could globally do this by using a wildcard in step 3 for the the first-level menu bar item, which would eliminate the need to explicitly type the app name in. In this case, you could use *;Quit * as the description. However, this doesn't seem to be possible for some reason. \n\nA: No, there is no way to coax all other applications into the hold-cmd-Q-for-couple-of-seconds-to-quit behavior.\nApple controls the apple apps and the SDK and they don’t implement this. \nAt best you could get a bunch of third party developers that like this idiom to all implement it. \n", "Q: iCloud Sync activity log Trying to figure out how to see activity happening while iCloud Files is syncing.

Then it won’t be stuck and you should be able to enable and disable the encryption in a forward and reverse direction.\nBarring that, Here is one process to try in case the file system needs minor repair while the OS isn’t running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode by pressing cmd+R at starup.\n\n*Open Disk Utility and unlock your partition.

Here’s a very detailed admin procedure that works to reset FileVault when you can’t enable things. It might also apply when you can’t decrypt. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/unable-to-enable-filevault-on-macos-mojave/\nI would encourage you make a full backup before resetting the FileVault password since if that fails, you could be locked out to even read the data at next reboot.\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Really check your backup is current and you have time to restore from it after an OS reinstall.\n\n*You will need to use the terminal from recovery OS to run  resetFileVaultpassword\n\n*You will have to reset all the passwords on the computer. That means re-entering them. The system counts putting the same password in place, but you will have to type them out and if you mis-type or don’t record them and the FileVault key - you could get locked out.\nIf this fails, chances are pretty hight that something is broken in your partition and you can still reformat the drive completely and restore your data.\n\n", "Q: What is the latest version of firmware for the AirPods (first generation)?

I've a 30\" Apple Cinema Display (A1083 EMC2011) that makes a noise when lowering brightness (low brightness = more noise, full brightness = no noise). \nGently slamming the side of the screen usually makes the noise go away, for a while, but it always comes back sooner or later.\nThe phenomenon reminds me of the floor lamp in my living room, which also makes a similar (albeit somewhat louder) noise when dimming down the light.\nWhat I'd like to know is: Is this \"low brightness\" noise present in all 30\" Apple Cinema Displays? (In which case I can save myself the time of asking a hardware guy to dismantle it in search of a cure.)\nPS! I should mention that I use the screen with a Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI-adapter. I don't know if this would contribute to the problem.\n\nA: It is not normal for the aluminum or polycarbonate cinema displays to make audible noise. They have been used 24x7 for a decade in recording studios and 3D and production cutting rooms where we put the CPU in a sound isolating box and never had to mitigate a Cinema Display due to noise until they start to fail. Many of these places are very low light so brightness is often way below max for us. \nWhen the power transformer starts to fail, that can then make the display make noise and these displays and power bricks were manufactured in pairs so swapping power supplies from two working pairs would make both get noisy. Don’t just assume the part that makes noise is the culprit. \nLike Allan and bmike have said there is something wrong with your display when driven by the adapter that supplies the transformed power from mains. \nIf you have to hit something to make it behave properly... Well an Apple Cinema display is not a mid 60s-era color TV and that should not happen.\nYou can do two things\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace it\n\n*Have it repaired\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair could be conditioning or filtering the mains power so the Apple power supply does less work and filtering. \n\n*Locate a new power supply that makes your display quiet again. \n\n*Have the LCD panel disassembled and inspected. If physical hits and taps alter vibration, it might just be a failed internal physical mount that needs repair. \n\n\n\nI would imagine that #2 might cost more than the value of a replacement unless you’re unable to source a matte LCD panel of that size.\n", "Q: How do I add a sub list with different bullets in Pages What I want is a list with the following levels of indentation:\n1.

Test\n2. Test\n\nHow would I achieve what I want in Pages automatically?\n\nA: You can use different Bullets & Lists style for different indentation level in Pages.\nAfter entering the 1st level item (i.e. 1. Test in your case), simply press the Enter key. This will automatically create a list, mark the entered text as the 1st item of list, assign default spacing between text and the number, and add numbering for the second item on the next line.\nNow, simply press the Tab key to create a sub-list. Change the bullet & list style as desired under Format sidebar.\nRepeat for every subsequent level of indentation.\n\nA: I know that this is nearly 4 years too late but if you go into the bullet list you can click the + sign to add a new one and name it whatever you want. Then design the bullet list with the different styles for each level of indentation and when you are done go back to the bullet list and click the \"Update\" button next to the custom list name you created.

The two approaches, i.e. prepending a dot . character to filename or using chflags hidden won't work as it will set the file as hidden on Mac and not on Windows.\nThe filenames prepended with . will remain hidden on any UNIX/Linux system.\n\nYou can hide files on Windows by getting properties on a file and checking the \"hidden\" box on the general tab. This will only hide a file if you don't change the default behavior of Windows Explorer to keep hidden files hidden.\n", "Q: App to track hours in each work site I'm a contractor and I visit my customer places, I would like to install an app that does automatically detect how much time I spend for a customer at which location with an ability to mark the project or client name.\nIn short I want a location based work log.

I need to get an older version of the said app. I have searched on the Internet and couldn't find it.\nThe app is v380. How do I get it for iOS 7?\n\nA: As mentioned in the Compatibility section on the app webpage, the app in question requires iOS 8.0 or later to run. You can only download the legacy version of an iOS app if the app developer continues to support it. And in case they do so, you should be able to download it using the App Store app on your iOS device.\nIf you are not getting the option to download the app when accessing it via the App Store app on your iOS device, the developer is no longer supporting the version of iOS running on your device. And there would be no way to download the app from anywhere else on the Internet.\nIn general app developers update their app with a major focus on supporting latest and recent version of iOS while dropping support for older versions.\nIf you have a serious/justifiable reason to run the app on older version of iOS, you can try contacting the developer via the Developer Website mentioned on the app webpage. (http://www.av380.cn/ in this case)\n\nA: Here is how to download older apps, if the developer left the app in the app store.  Install the business version of itunes on your computer. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079 If you have installed a newer version of iTunes, read the section about Library.itl http://osxdaily.com/2017/10/09/get-itunes-12-6-3-with-app-store/Down Download the app in itunes on your computer.  This will add the app to your list of downloaded apps.  Now on the iPhone, you will be able to see it in the list of your apps in the appstore app. The app will appear with a cloud icon.  Download it.  You will get a question asking if you want to use the older version. \nI used this method to download V380 to my iPhone 4 running 7.1.2.  The app installed, but when run, crashes before I can get a picture of the app. \n", "Q: Can't open some ePub books in Books.app on macOS Mojave Two ePub books that I've bought won't open in Books.app in macOS Mojave 10.14. The books have social DRM (personal information added to the content of the book), and I don't think this should be a problem for Books.app. If I rename the epub extension to zip, then I can unzip the file using the unzip command. Using the Finder doesn't work somehow. Other books open normally.\nLooking at the contents, I see that it uses XHTML inside an OEBPS folder, while other books use HTML in an OPS folder. \nWhat is the reason that Books.app doesn't open these ePub files?  I can read them OK with Calibre.\n\nA: If your ebook indeed is unencrypted, you can try to open the ePub with the free Sigil.app (an ePub creator/editor) and write another copy to disk.\nSigil is able to repair a lot of structural problems. You can get a precompiled dmg as well as the full source code here.\nI agree the \"social DRM\" should not pose any obstacle for using these eBooks with Books.app. But I suspect the \"patching personal data into the eBooks\" is done by an automated process, which simply went awry in your case. Maybe you even have some special characters in your identifying information (quotes, accents, ampersand, general unicode characters).\n\nA: It's hard to know whether the \"social DRM\" or some other aspect of the epubs you mention is causing the problem with Books app.  The best course is to let the publisher know so they can investigate if they wish and in the meantime use Calibre or another epub reader to read the books.\n", "Q: Use Web browser and Latex using iPad, Monitor, Apple Mouse and keyboard I own a ASUS monitor (VGA, HDMI, DisplayPort ports), and am about to buy a computer to use it with.\nI usually use Apple devices, so I am oriented towards getting a Mac mini. However, I suspect that this could be an overkill, since the only two things I would be using on the computer would be browsing the Internet (PDFs, quick information, so no videos or detailed graphics involved) and use Latex (a lot).\nSo my question is, can an iPad or similar be more appropriate for this use case? Is it possible and realistic/convenient to connect it with monitor, mouse and keyboard and use it as a computer? I repeat: I just need something that makes Latex and Google Chrome work well, without delays or silly incompatibilities. So for example, the signal should arrive decently to the monitor, which is a 27''.\n\nA: For your use case, I'd advise to take a systematic approach starting with researching if the desired workflow is possible to be performed on an iPad end-to-end.\nBy end-to-end I mean getting data onto iPad, checking on the availability and maturity of the tools/apps which will satisfactorily get the work done and getting data off the device to desired output (digital such as sharing it with other computer/people or physical such as hard copy).\nI'd try to address your concerns one-by-one as asked for in the question.\nFirst of all, unlike a desktop computer or a laptop, an external monitor cannot be simply used as an extended display for an iOS device (iPad/iPhone). You can however connect your iOS device to an external display using an adapter to mirror your device. For more details, you can get started with the following Apple Support document:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Apple Digital AV Adapters for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch\nIf you would not like to involve dangling and always connected cable, a slightly expensive solution could be to connect an Apple TV to your display and mirror your iOS device using Apple TV onto the display.\nWhile extended display is not natively supported by iOS, certain apps are programmed to take advantage of an external display and show extended content.\nComing to keyboard, it's possible to use external keyboards with iOS devices. However, your typical wired/IrDA wireless keyboard won't work. Bluetooth keyboards can be paired and work fine. Apple Magic keyboard can be paired to work with an iOS device. Various 1st party and 3rd party keyboards are available for iPad with iPad Pro supporting Apple Smart keyboard.\nUsing a keyboard frees up screen real estate. Using Apple Magic keyboard would be recommended in your case as you are planning to use an external monitor to mirror content. This way you can use the keyboard detached from the device.\niOS user experience is based on touch, not click and is not designed/programmed keeping a pointing device in mind. Hence it's not possible to use a mouse with iPad.\nGoogle Chrome is available on the App Store and can be installed on iPad alongside Safari which comes pre-installed. You'll need to research on the availability of Latex apps on the App Store.\n", "Q: Clean install macOS keeps restarting and returning to macOS Utilities I'm trying to do a clean install of macOS Mojave on my 2012 13\" MacBook Pro using a bootable USB. I'm doing it on a new 1 TB SSD that I've installed after my last one died.\nThe problem I'm having is that ever time I run the installer, everything looks like it's working, but then towards the end of the installation, the computer restarts and ultimately returns to the macOS Utilities menu.\nI've tried formatting the hard drive several times and have even tried installing OS X Mountain Lion via an Internet recovery.\nI'm struggling to find a solution to this, so would really appreciate some help.\n\nA: For the benefit of anyone having this issue in the future. The problem was the hard drive cable.  I've replaced it and now everything is working properly.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Internal Hard Drive dead? Not too long ago, I tried to update my MacBook Pro to the newest OS (Mojave).\nI downloaded the updater etc. and started updating my software. I didn't mind, so I just let it update for itself. I came back some hours after, to a black screen, and nothing responding. The computer didn't respond to any clicks neither to the keyboard, or lastly the display/screen getting closed.\nI tried to shut down the computer by holding the power button. I then proceed to try to open it again and it shows a blinking folder with a question mark, which I found out, means it can't find a bootable drive.\nI tried to open it in recovery mode, and from there download the OS, but every time I agreed to the terms and conditions etc. it sent me to the page, where I had to pick which hard drive the OS would be downloaded on, but I had nothing to choose. Nothing was there. \nI also tried to go to disk utility, and I can't see my hard drive on the left side.\nDoes this mean my internal hard drive is dead? What does this mean, and what can I do?\nThank you for reading\n\nA: Not withstanding Nimesh's comment and presuming that method does not work...\nInstalling Mojave was undoubtedly not the cause of this issue, more like just coincidental. That said it is likely that something has happened to the HD (or SSD) in your MacBook pro.\nIt could be a loose connection, it could be a damaged/dead drive. heck it could be a number of things. But the one thing they have in common is that it is likely that the MacBook will need to be opened and serviced by a tech competent in doing said work.\nIf it is within warranty take it to your nearest Apple store. If there is not an Apple store nearby, call Apple tech support.\nIf it is out of warranty you can still take it to Apple but they will charge you for the fix. Possibly more than an independent Apple dealer might. But that would be your choice and based on your local experience with Apple stores, dealers and the repair jobs they are experienced with.\n", "Q: iPhone - How to add people to on-going video chat in Facebook messenger? I'm using an iPhone 7 running iOS 12. \nWhen I'm in an on-going video chat, I can't find the \"add people\" button to add more people to the on-going video chat. In Android I can see that button just fine, so I'm surprised that iOS doesn't have it. \nDo I need to activate it via settings or something?\n\nA: I got it. It's not the iPhone's fault, it's the fault of the other phone which uses Messenger Lite. Messenger Lite doesn't have conference call feature (at this moment). So if Messenger (full version) calls Messenger Lite, the \"add people\" button isn't available. So I install Messenger (full version) for the other phone and try calling again, and now I can see the \"add people\" button.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to recover a deleted APFS volume? Nothing’s been changed or formatted. The “container” is not mounted and the volume I accidentally deleted still shows up in the Boot menu at startup. \nHow would I go about recovering this APFS volume?\n\nA: Most commercial file recovery utilities for the Mac also will perform recovery of deleted partitions. Disk Drill Pro, EaseUS, Stellar Data Recovery Pro, etc.\nPrimary concern is avoiding writing anything to the drive with the deleted partition. Don't run any disk repair/maintenance utilities or attempt to re-create the partition. Avoid using the affected drive (and if it's the boot drive of the Mac, then the Mac itself) at all if possible. My suggestion would be either:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot the Mac into Target Disk Mode and run recovery software from a different Thunderbolt-connected Mac\n\n*(if your recovery software offers this option) create a bootable recovery USB drive on a different Mac and boot the affected Mac from it\n\n", "Q: iPhone weather app - when does each \"day\" begin/end for high/low temperature? I know the two temperatures for each day on the weather app indicate the high and low. My question is, what time does each \"day\" begin/end? At midnight or some other time? The highs and lows often don't seem to \"fit\" with a midnight begin/end for each day, but I'm not sure.\nIf measured midnight to midnight, then I'm confused. Right now the weather app predicts (for Durham, NC) that it will be 19 degrees tomorrow morning at 6AM according to the HOURLY prediction, but the DAILY low for tomorrow is listed as 26 degrees. This doesn't jive. Anyone know the reason?\n\nA: If is believed thy the iPhone weather.app uses a Meteorological Day.\nThis is rightly sunrise to sunrise.\n\nThis is roughly sunrise to sunrise and meant to be more useful for people who are looking ahead and thinking \"what's the high today and the low tonight?\"\nCheck the low for the following morning (around 4 or 5am), that's probably where you'll find it.\n\n(Source)\n", "Q: 2019 Update: Where does Chrome store cookies on Mac?

This can be partially achieved by powering the Mac mini via a UPS, although if the power cut was long enough the UPS would also fail.\n\n*Knowing if the systems fail, so that I can fix them. I wouldn't want the systems to fail and me not know for 6 months.\nAre there some specific settings I should be looking at in macOS to enable me to leave it running constantly carrying out tasks 1. & 2. above?\n\nA: Go to your Energy Saver and set Turn off Display to Never:\n\nThen make sure you screensaver, if enabled goes on after a set amount to time otherwise it will go to sleep.\nTurn it off by opening the Desktop & Screen Saver preference pane in System Preferences then selecting Never in the drop down box in the bottom left corner of the window.\n\n\nA: There are a few built-in settings in macOS and a 3rd party app that you should be looking at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under System Preferences → Energy Saver → Power Adapter, enable Restart after power failure.\n\n*Turn on automatic login by going to System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Options → Automatic Login and select your preferred user account.\n\n*You may also wish to install and run a helper app that can prevent your Mac mini from sleeping automatically. I'd recommend installing KeepingYouAwake.\nEnabling number 1. above will ensure that your computer boots automatically after a power failure. This will ensure that the computer boots automatically after the power is restored.\nNumber 2. will automatically log into your preferred user account after a restart, thus requiring no user intervention to start things up.\nNumber 3. will ensure your computer never goes to sleep mode. You can configure the app to startup automatically upon system start.\nDoing above three should ideally take care of your requirement.

It worked great and there were no issues, until I needed to reformat it to use on Windows again. I've formatted the drive as FAT32 with a MBR partition and it reflects as such in the Disk Utility:\nDrive:\n\nPartition:\n\nWindows Disk Management:\n\nCMD Diskpart -> list disk:\n\nFor some reason, Windows doesn't even recognise that the drive is inserted into the PC. I'd expect to see a 16GB disk with no mountable volumes, instead I just see the same disk-listings that were there before I inserted the drive. \nWhat frustrates me is that I've got experience with partitions and it's not usually rocket-science. The third image shows a hybrid drive with a MacOS partition (for my Macbook Air) that also contains a exFat partition for my media.\nI've done this before many times over but can't, for the life of me, figure out why it's not working on this flash drive.

Success here will also depend on having the user names and passwords as necessary.\n\nA: If you can put the Mac's drive in an external USB enclosure there are utilities that you can purchase and install on your Windows PC to read and write the disk format of a Mac.\nFor example Paragon Software has utilities to read and write both HFS+ and the new APFS disk formats on a Windows/Linux PC. This would enable your PC to access the Mac's drive and get the info off of it.\nAll you will need to determine is what the Mac's hard drive was formatted as, HFS+ or APFS. Knowing the model number or macOS version that was installed might help.\n\nA: Booting such a combination will not work very well and is also most probably unnecessary for mere data rescue operations. \nThe commercial options for intersystem interoperability with Paragon Software are already in Steve Chambers answer.\nBut there are more options, cheaper options, and sometimes a bit thorny options. Built into Linux or and easy install from official repositories/github.\nIf it is a drive that is removable you just need an external enclosure to put the Mac-drive into and then look closer at for example other StackExchanges:\nHow to read and write HFS+ journaled external HDD in Ubuntu without access to OS X?  (if it is HFSplus formatted)\nHow to mount a HFS partition in Ubuntu as Read/Write? (if it is HFSplus formatted)\nAPFS FUSE Driver for Linux (if it is APFS formatted, like APFS itself: quite immature and read-only.

How can I diagnose why memory is being allocated for wireless networking?\n\nA: TL;DR - Your Wi-Fi program uses memory when you have network connections. It starts with little allocation and when you run other programs, Wi-Fi uses memory to do that work. Log out to free that memory if you don't want to quit programs or thr don’t release their connections to your liking. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why is my Wi-Fi process using 3GB of memory?\n\nAs a developer (or just someone curious about memory allocation / virtual and resident/swap), it's pretty easy to dump the heap and virtual memory map for any process to inspect your current memory allocations.\nsudo heap Wi-Fi\n\nExcept there's a wrinkle with Wi-Fi so you'll want to pass the process number the actual name of the binary, instead of the whole friendly name. (If you get close - heap knows to prompt you with a list of potential matching processes sudo heap Wi\nsudo heap WiFiAgent\nsudo mmap WiFiAgent\n\nNow, the larger idea is Apple has re-architected the networking stack. On older OS, kernel just absorbed all the memory needed for networking, but now there are 4 programs (2 pairs) that run in user space and root space and the only reason they use Mach ports and memory is to serve and buffer network connections. If you have less connections open, the usage is small. In practice, I've never seen this cause issues since when you log out and back in (especially if you have no apps start at log in), the allocation of this set of programs is very lean and small.\nThey only grow when you run programs - so you'd need to look at the programs you run to reduce the load they put on networking. Browsers with lots of tabs open, \"apps\" that are really electron frameworks and node apps can be chatty on the network side or allocate a lot of resources when a more clean native app might use less system resources.\n\n", "Q: MacOS partition shows up as FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF (Mojave) I suspect this this may be  a duplicate, but I'm not sure what I should do considering almost everyone else has another macOS version or other partition size and I'm not sure how to generalize another answer to my setup.\nSo I wanted to delete a Linux partition back to APFS on my main HDD, but it split up the APPLE SSD SM0256F Media.

For example my 85W power supply has \"Delta Electronics (Jiang Sui) Ltd.\" written on it in the same place.\nAn image search on Google for the 60W adapter also reveals that other power supplies have the same writing on it as yours.\nHowever, it is not a 100% proof that your charger is original, as anyone could in principle write such texts on a charger. It would obviously be illegal however. \n", "Q: Too many dots in Safari password fields Safari 12.0.1 (14606.2.104.1.1) / macOS Mojave 10.14.1 (18B75) / both Mac Mini late 2018 and macBookAir late 2018.\nEach time I type a character in a password field, instead of being displayed as a unique dot, it generates lots of dots after a micro-delay. I know it's hard to believe, but in the first example below, I have actually typed one single character; in the second one, two characters:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Same behavior on any web page with a password field.\n\n*Safari only. No problem on Chrome or Firefox.\n\n*Asking 1Password to fill in the field works. BTW, I thought 1Password was the culprit, but disabling its extension had no effect.\n\n*Deleting type=\"password\" with Safari's inspector makes the problem disappear, but of course that reveals the typed characters.\n\n\nSo I am left scratching my head. Any lead?\n\nA: Found it, my fault. I had recently defined a system-wide shortcut associating the symbol \"•\" to another string. Worst idea ever! As soon as a dot appeared, it was expanded to several characters, all replaced by dots, and so on. Since I usually use 1Password, I only hit the issue a few days after the fact.\nNow there's something on the internet in case somebody makes the same mistake :)\n", "Q: What is this Vertical bar of Inverted Colours on my Screen? I was cleaning my Macbook Air at the weekend and think I might have damaged the screen. A vertical bar of inverted colours appeared on the left-hand side (the right was fine initially) but then both sides of the screen displayed as shown in the image.\n\nAfter about an hour of doing nothing, the bar on the left-hand side returned to normal but the right-hand side bar has been there since.\nI’ve tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing around the screen (does nothing)\n\n*Cleaning it again (gently\nand with no cleaning fluid)\n\n*Connecting it to an external monitor\n(output is fine which suggests the GPU is fine)\n\n\nAny ideas what has happened? It’s a 6-year-old machine but I’ve never had any issues with it until the weekend.\nDoes the screen need to be replaced?\nEdit: Spontaneously started working again :)\n\nA: Personally, I would tell you that the screen was broken.  However, the bar on the left-hand side turn to normal, which confuses me.  \nStill, if the problem persists, consider getting the computer fixed.\nI'm no tech genius here, though.  I've just seen plenty of screens this way (usually smaller strips), and they never really fix themselves.\n", "Q: Website URLs seem to refresh in the background I have written a Python script hosted on a Raspberry Pi that controls my garage doors. The doors are operated by sending a GET request to one of a few URLs on the server. It's only available within the LAN.\nWe use three iPhones, two 7s and a 6, all with the latest iOS version, to operate it with Safari.\nBy inspecting my server logs I am finding that one of the 7s and the 6 appear to be firing GET requests an random times, even in the middle of the night for example, causing my doors to open 'by themselves'. The other 7 doesn't seem to do this.\nI've tried leaving it with the URLs added to the home screen, and also just bookmarked in Safari, but it doesn't seem to change the behaviour.\nIs there some kind of background app refresh going on here that I don't know about, or could it be some other kind of fault? The Python end seems to be fine as the logging shows that it's responding to legitimate GET requests each time, but I can't find a difference between the iPhones that exhibit the behaviour and the one that doesn't.\nCan you help? Thank you!\n\nA: Many browsers do prerendering for often-visited sites.  It's possible Safari is preloading the URL as a top hit because you visit that URL a lot. Some browsers also prefetch sites to create image previews. \nHTTP GETs are supposed to be safe and idempotent according to the W3C standards.  Many browsers (and proxy servers) make the assumption that it's safe to trigger and/or cache GETs. POSTs are supposed to be used for effect-inducing operations.\n", "Q: Which charger to get fast charging of iPhone XR? I'm about to buy an iPhone XR. Technical specification says it's possible to charge 50% of the battery in 30 minutes. However, seems that the provided 5W charger is not able to do that. I've been in the Apple Store and they said I need an iPad charger, but which one?\nWhen a search for \"charger\" and filter for \"XR model,\" I get this one. Is it the correct one?\n\nA: \nHowever, seems that the provided 5 W charger is not able to do that\n  [charge the battery to 50% in 30 minutes]. I've been in the Apple\n  Store and they said I need an iPad charger, but which one?\n\nYou need a charger that outputs at least 18 watts or is rated for 5V at 3.6A (W = V * A)\nHowever, (IMO) you should get a charger that's capable of powering/charging all (not simultaneously, obviously) your devices.  The way chargers work is that the rating 12W, 18W, 80W is the maximum amount of power that it will deliver not the amount of power it will \"push\" to the device.\nSo, if a device says it's rated at 18W, it will draw no more than that.  If your power supply is greater than or equal to 18W, it will work.  If it's less, it will either charge slowly or you could damage the power adapter.  See this answer for more details\nThis is why you get a power adapter greater than what you need.  Getting an 80W, for example, will charge your MacBook Pro, your iPad, and you iPhone, whereas the 5W charger will only reliably charge your iPhone.\n\nA: The linked product is a 12 W adapter. To see the list of supported fast chargers for iPhone, refer to the Apple Support document:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fast charge your iPhone\nAs mentioned in the article, to fast charge your iPhone, you'll at a minimum need a 18 W adapter. The same can be purchased from the Apple online store. You can also go with a compatible 3rd party adapter.\n\nA: To achieve this result you will need one of the adapters mentioned in the article:\n\nwith accessory Apple USB-C Power Adapters (18W Model A1720, 29W Model A1540, 30W Model A1882, 61W Model A1718, 87W Model A1719).\n\n(Source)\nNOTE You might not be able to achieve the actual result:\n\nCharge time varies with environmental factors; actual results will vary.\n\nThere is no point getting a higher wattage adapter, if you don't need it for a Mac, as the highest output is 18 watts.\n\nThe maximum power output is 18 watts and that seems enough to charge the iPhone 8 Plus and X at their maximum speeds, just like Apple's USB-C adapters.\n\n(Source),\nYou can get a higher wattage adapter but it will ruin battery life:\n\nAnd the myth that charging your device at a faster rate will reduce the life of your device's battery is false. For some older devices, the higher specced charger just won't work at all, while newer devices will just charge faster.\n\n(Source)\nYou can buy an 18 watt adapter from Apple here.\n", "Q: Can an iMac be used as a replacement for laptop? I am thinking of buying an iMac as a replacement for my laptop. Do iMac have batteries like in a laptop or do we have to always keep it plugged-in to power while using?\n\nA: iMac is a consumer desktop computer and doesn't come with a built in battery. Neither is it possible to install batteries in an iMac.\nUnlike a laptop (MacBook) an iMac is not portable and have to be kept plugged in to a power source while in use.\nWhether an iMac can be used as a replacement for a laptop depends on your specific workflow. It runs the same operating as a Apple laptop (MacBook) and comes with mostly comparable hardware and feature set.\n", "Q: Screen blinking \"HDMI no signal\" when Mac is sleeping I usually leave my computer, and let it go to sleep after 15 minutes.\nMy external screen is showing a blue screen saying \"HDMI no signal\" every other minute while my MacBook is asleep, and the screen lasts for a few seconds. If I unplug the external screen, the message appears for a longer period of time.\nIt did not happen with other computers (I have tested with a MacBook Air and a Windows Surface PC).\nThe built-in screen is turned off and does not blink in any way.\n\nSetup:\nI have a MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017) running MacOS Mojave (10.14.1). I have a USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter, to which my external monitor (ASUS VS248H) is connected using a HDMI cable.\nQuestion: Is there any way to avoid screen blinking (except for turning the screen off when I leave it)?\nI.e. sending the correct signal to the external screen, so it does not think it is disconnected.\n\nA: The Apple Digital AV Multiport Adapter is a passive converter meaning that it's just \"rearranging\" the pin outs from the DisplayPort signal to the HDMI signal - basically, the monitor is detecting voltage, but there's no data being sent.\nI expand on this more in this answer to a similar question.\nInstead, you should be using either of the following with your monitor which supports DVI and HDMI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type C DisplayPort to DVI adapter (active is \"better\", but passive is OK here since DVI and DisplayPort are similar signals.\n\n*Tyep C DisplayPort to HDMI active adapter.\n\n", "Q: What do these Bluetooth icons shown in iOS status bar mean? I have two Bluetooth speakers from the same brand. They both have a mic and a call answer button as well as media playback control.\nWhen I connect to one of them I see the following icon in the status bar:\n\nThe other speaker when connected, shows the following in the status bar:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is a speaker represented by a headphones icon?\n\n*Why do the icons differ?\n\n*What are their respective meanings?\n\n*Does the absence of a battery indicator mean that the speaker doesn't report battery status?\nI am using iOS 10.3.3.\n\nA: Refer to the Apple Support document, Status icons and symbols on your iPhone:\n\n\nThe battery level of your paired Bluetooth device.\n\nYour iPhone is paired with a wireless headset, headphones, or earbuds.\n\n\nA: The first one shows the battery level if reported.\nThe second one is showing that a wireless headset or speakers are connected.\n\nWhy is a speaker represented by an headphones icon?\n\nThat is the default icon for all audio connection.\n\nWhy do the icons differ?\n\nThe first one is when the devices battery level, when not reported it wont show.\n\nWhat are their respective meanings?\n\nThe first tone is the device is charging. The second one that some speakers or a headset is connected.\n\nDoes the absence of a battery indicator mean that the speaker doesn't report battery status?\n\nYes. To view the battery while the device battery is not displayed, there is a battery widget available when swiping right on the first page of the Home Screen.\nApple recommend answer:\n\nThe icon is displayed if the device sends a signal to the iPhone to report the connection and battery status. That is something new for the iPhone. I agree with deggie that the icon is just a standard, they don't have different icons for different devices. It is just reporting the device connected and the battery status of the device.\n\n(Source)\n", "Q: Opening a new Finder *tab* from command line I'm wondering if there is a means of opening a new finder tab (not window) from the command line. I can do, e.g.,\nopen .\n\nbut this opens a new window. It would be nice to open a new tab in the most-recently active existing finder window.\n\nA: You really can't via any “normal” shell commands, but you can run AppleScript via the shell to accomplish the task.\nHere's a Bash function with the command fnt for “Finder New Tab”:\nfunction fnt()\n{\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to perform action \"AXPress\" of menu item \"New Tab\" of menu \"File\" of menu bar item \"File\" of menu bar 1 of application process \"Finder\"'\n}\n\nAdd the above bash function to your ~/.bash_profile or ̃/.profile file to use it. After adding, restart Terminal or use the source command in the current Terminal window to have access to the fnt function.\nThis should work on any version macOS that has the “New Tab” command in the “File” menu. You'll also need to add Terminal to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Accessibility\nI understand some improvement to AppleScript has been made in Mojave relative to tabs in the Finder, but I'm still using macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and can't test.\n\nA: Here is the solution I came up with, based on the answer at How do you duplicate current open Finder view in new tab (Mavericks)?\n    function newtab()\n{\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\"\n    activate\n    set t to target of Finder window 1\n    set toolbar visible of window 1 to true\nend tell\ntell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n    keystroke \\\"t\\\" using command down\nend tell\ntell application \\\"Finder\\\"\n    set target of Finder window 1 to POSIX file \\\"`pwd`\\\"\nend tell\" 1> /dev/null\n}\n\nAll the escaped quotes isn't very elegant, but seemed to be necessary to allow the command substitution.\nThanks to Christopher Stone for pointing me in the direction of AppleScript!

I had a 1080p monitor and it looked slightly pixelated. I bought the LG Ultrafine 4k display and it looks great. I asked my work to buy me a monitor for the office and they offered a 1080p monitor. I am a web and graphic designer so it looking good is important to me. I also noticed that the native display is 2560 x 1600 which isn't 4k. Am I going to have to convince them to get a cheaper 4k monitor? I have a 2017 Macbook Pro Touchbar.\n\nA: Yes. You will have to convince them that you need the proper tool for your assigned task, one that offers 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160 pixels.\nYou also need your display to be flexible enough to emulate the different resolutions your end-user may have.\n\nA: The real issue is PPI, that is resolution dividing by size (both in diagonal). The larger the display is, the higher resolution you will need.\nAlso the distance between eye and monitor is important, but that does not generally change much.\n", "Q: Updating to Mojave & enabling FileVault at the same time Recently I decided to update to Mojave.

At the bottom of my back of the phone is nothing as suggested here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/85943/318324 in my settings I found that I have the model: ME341LL/A\n\nA: This sounds like the digitizer is failing.\nThe digitizer is a \"glass layer\" that sits on top of your LCD display to accept input (taps, swipes, etc.).  This can begin to fail for any number of reasons from physical damage, to water damage or even aging.\nThe iPhone 5S has the digitizer and LCD as a single assembly, so to replace one, you'll have to replace both.  iFixit has an excellent guide on how to do this.

(Have not yet upgraded) I have a 2015 iMac 5k running OS X Yosemite 10.10.x. I've always been nervous about upgrading an expensive machine. Now I am curious about upgrading, but I would like to find an option that would allow me to roll back to my current set up if I did.\nI am aware of several options referenced online, and which I used to be familiar with, but I wonder which are relevant to me and which really would support rolling back to OS X Yosemite 10.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine: I take backups to an external USB, but I am not clear whether this keeps an OS backup, whether there is an option to restore the OS and, if so, whether that would also restore files. I suspect an OS downgrade is not possible and that Time Machine's forte is file and app backups.\n\n*Recovery Partition: I recall, from an exercise with a MacBook Air, the notion that my machine might have a Recovery Partition. Does it? If so, which OS is stored on it - e.g. The one shipped, or the current one? If I upgrade, what does the Recovery Partition then contain? How is it restored and, again, can you restore only the OS underneath files, and/or would this erase the whole disk?\n\n*Recovery Disk Assistant: I recall this and I think I did it with a MacBook Air - the idea that you can make a bootable USB disk containing your OS, and can restore it. This seems to appeal as it seems to be a way to snapshot my current OS. But is it still a thing? I recall reading it was Lion-specific (?). How is it made/restored - through?\n\n*OS X Recovery/macOS Recovery: I believe booting to this contains options \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\", (see above) \"Reinstall macOS\" (really, only the OS, and from where?), \"Get help online\" and \"Disk Utility\" (for manually erasing the drive and then picking one of the aforementioned options?)\n\n*Bootable Installer: Now I see pages about creating one of these for Mavericks or Yosemite. Looks more technical, on the command line. But again seems to employ using an external drive to make a backup, and restored via macOS Recovery after selection via Startup Manager or Startup Disk preferences (?).\n\n*Over-the-Internet OS download - I can't recall in which scenarios an OS version would be pulled from the internet rather than from either a partition or a USB source, for example.\nWhat is right for me?\nI am concerned about upgrading to Mojave or lower (?) and having no way back. It is often the case with Apple that, whilst docs make clear something is possible, there is a catch - eg. Not being able to roll back THAT for, or a feature supported/deprecated only for a particular version. Which of the above options are supported by which OS version is a bit of a black box, in my opinion. \nIdeally, I'd have an option to roll back the OS underneath the files or, failing that, to roll back to a snapshot of both.\n\nA: \nNow I am curious about upgrading, but I would like to find an option that would allow me to roll back to my current set up if I did.\n\nYou can use Internet recovery to rollback to the factory installed version of macOS. From the Apple Support document, How to reinstall macOS from macOS Recovery:\n\nmacOS Recovery makes it easy to reinstall the Mac operating system, even if you need to erase your startup disk first. All you need is a connection to the Internet. If a wireless network is available, you can choose it from the Wi-Fi  menu in the menu bar. This menu is also available in macOS Recovery.\nShift-Option-⌘-R\nInstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\n\nDo note to keep a Time Machine backup of handy. Once you have restored the original OS, you can recover data using the backup. Also, it's best to test the sanity of the backup before actually reinstalling the OS.\n", "Q: Is there a way to know which Program sent some files to the trash bin?

The disk that my OSX files are stored are on disk0s2, which is the FFFFFFF partition... how do I fix up my ability to boot into the OSX Mojave without wiping out my data or is there a way? Does APFS have anything to do with this?\nAt this point I don't care about the Ubuntu 18.04 partition, but I do not want to lose any data on the 900+GB partition, which is all my the Mac files are.\n\nA: Usually when the FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF error occurs, the partition starting and ending values are still correct. I assume this is true in your case. If I am correct, then you need to enter the following commands to change FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF to 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 1900925984 -t apfs disk0\n\nThe EFI partition (disk0s1) is used occasionally by macOS, so you need to keep this partition.

Usually when the FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF error occurs, the partition starting and ending values are still correct. I assume this is true in your case. If I am correct, then you can implement the following steps to change the partition type from FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF to 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the flash drive to the Live version.\n\n\n*Open a Terminal application window.\n\n\n*Enter the command lsblk to get the name of the internal drive.

I bought the first one (the black one) a while ago and haven’t had any problems with it. I installed Devuan on it and everything was good. \nThe second one (the white MacBook) arrived today and unfortunately I haven’t been able to get it to boot into anything. When I turn it on I get a flashing folder icon with a question mark. I read online that it’s either a bad hard drive or RAM so I tried swapping them both out with the parts from my black MacBook with no luck. \nThen, after putting the original hard drive back something changed and the hard drive showed up but with the name Windows and when it would boot it would say no operating system. \nI figured that if I got this drive to be identified I could install Linux on it from the black MacBook and then just put it in the white one and it would boot. I installed Linux and put the drive in and now it just sits at a white screen with a mouse cursor. \nHow can I proceed to to get this MacBook to boot into any OS?\n\nA: Not all A1181's are the same. A list of the specs for various A1181's are given at this website. Other than some being black and others being white, here are some other differences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Early models have \"Core Duo\" processors. These are 32 bit machines. These machines can only run 32 bit BIOS or EFI booting operating systems.\n\n*Middle models have \"Core 2 Duo\" processors. These are 64 bit machines, however the EFI is still 32 bit. These machines can run 32 bit or 64 bit BIOS booting operating systems, but only 32 bit EFI booting operating systems.\n\n*Later models have \"Core 2 Duo\" processors with 64 bit EFIs.  These machines can run 32 bit or 64 bit BIOS booting operating systems, but only 64 bit EFI booting operating systems.\n\n\nIt would be helpful if you could list the ID and/or family for both Macs.\nAccording to the website, possible IDs and corresponding families for the A1181 are given below. \n    ID                        Family\n----------     -----------------------------------------\nMacBook1,1     (13-inch)\nMacBook2,1     (13-inch, Late 2006), (13-inch, Mid 2007)\nMacBook3,1     (13-inch, Late 2007)\nMacBook4,1     (13-inch, Early 2008)\nMacBook5,2     (13-inch, Early 2009)\n\nI should also note that some early Macs needed a firmware update before being able to run BIOS booting operating systems. See: About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers.\nNote: BIOS booting normally does not require a MBR table. However, Intel Macs require a well formed MBR table in order to BIOS boot. This does not present a problem when using BIOS/MBR arrangement. Many BIOS booting Linux distributions use a BIOS/GPT arrangement. If you choose this arrangement, then you must hybrid partition the boot drive. This is a firmware requirement, even if the booting operating system will not use the values stored in the MBR table.\n", "Q: Create Wi-Fi access point in macOS without Internet connection I want to use Keynote.app on my iPhone to operate a Keynote presentation on my MacBook Pro. In order to do that, both iPhone and Mac needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network. But sometimes, there is no Wi-Fi available or it is really unreliable.\nI used to solve this by creating Wi-Fi access point on my MacBook. But with macOS High Sierra, it looks, that you cannot create proper Wi-Fi access point without tethering Internet connection. Because, in case I am not connected to ethernet, after creating the Wi-Fi access point in MacBook, I can see it on my iPhone in the list of available Wi-Fi networks, but it says, it has no Internet connection. So even if I try to connect to it, it shows this little tick icon next to the name of the wi-fi, but there is no Wi-Fi icon in the iPhone status bar. And it acts like it is not connected to the Wi-Fi as I am not able to manipulate the presentation through the Keynote app.\nThe same counts if I want to control some game with my iPhone (like Real Racing 2, which needs both iPhone and Mac to be on the same Wi-Fi network).\nIs there any chance to creating a Wi-Fi access point on MacBook that is not otherwise connected to the Internet? I have tried searching for a solution on StackExchange and on the Web but to no avail.\n\nA: This sounds like your iPhone deciding not to use the Wifi network it is connected to - perhaps it is instead directing all traffic to the Cellular data connection, since that does have internet access.\nPerhaps try Disabling Cellular Data in addition to what you've already done above, so the iPhone has only one available network to send data to.\n", "Q: Rsync mishap .. OS hdd is now full I attempted to use the command:\nsudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/1-mate /Volumes/Hired-Hand\n\n.. to move the contents of one connected drive to another. This was going great until my boot drive filled all the way up (150mb free now).\nThe problem is that I mistyped the name of the destination.. should have been \"HiredHand\" NOT \"Hired-Hand\". \nI am clueless where the copied files were placed and need to delete them so that I can use my computer again. Please help!\nI am using macOS. Cannot locate any threads anywhere that deal with this issue.. other than someone 3 years ago on stack exchange saying \"they found the files\" and all is well now for them.\nThank you.\n\nA: There is nothing inherently magically going on within /Volumes. So if you use rsync or something else to copy data into that folder, it will just do as told. If there is no folder with the target name already it will just create a new one on your main drive. \nSo\nsudo rm -rf /Volumes/Hired-Hand\n\nshould remove the files/folders created by rsync. Just make sure you get the name right (and maybe eject the HiredHand drive first). \n", "Q: Switch \"Touch Bar shows\" per app Some apps (eg IDEs) I like to have Function keys directly shown, but most other apps I like the Quick Actions with Control Strip.\nIs there a way to get the Touch Bar to automatically switch between the settings rather than having to manually goto Keyboard prefs?\n\n\nA: You can designate certain apps to show function keys instead of app controls (in the touch bar) by adding them in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Function Keys.\nRelated: Is it possible to set touch bar in F1-F12 mode for a specific app?\n", "Q: Delete many network configurations at once Opening my Network preferences screen in Mojave 10.14.2 on my MacBook Pro 2017 takes about two minutes, due to the massive number of network configurations that were automatically installed when I once attached a USB walkie talkie.\nIs it possible to delete all these connections at once? Clicking to delete them one by one is incredibly slow due to the UI hanging after removing one.\n\nNetwork preferences with literally 1000 network connections\n\nA: You can use the Terminal to delete them out:\nUsage: networksetup -removenetworkservice <networkservice>\n    Remove the service named <networkservice>. Will fail if this is the only service on the hardware port that <networkservice> is on.\n\nTo get it to list then remove all the ones with MT65XX you'd need to do something like:\n$ services=(\"${(@f)$(networksetup -listallnetworkservices | grep MT65XX | sed s/\\*//)}\")\n$ for service in $services[@]; do networksetup -removenetworkservice $service; done\n\nThat this does is builds a list of services by running:\nnetworksetup -listallnetworkservices | grep MT65XX | sed s/\\*//\n\nThe @f splits the list on newlines, ignoring spaces. The grep finds just the MT65XX lines, and the sed removes any *, which denote disabled services in the output.\nThen, for each of those, it runs the networksetup -removenetworkservice step.\n", "Q: Does charging and CPU usage affect each other? If I use the CPU heavily while charging a Mac, how much slower will the charging be? It would be interesting to hear if someone has data how many minutes it takes to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge 0-100% while using ~0% CPU\n\n*Charge 0-100% while using 100% CPU\n\n\nPS! Another interesting question (probably a separate question) would be: If a heavy 100% CPU job takes 1 hour on a 100% charged machine, how long does it take on a charging machine?\n\nA: The CPU is boss of the power scheme and will get all the power it requests. The charger is boss of the maximum power it will output.\n\n*\n\n*In practice, only thermal conditions throttle the CPU when it doesn't decide to throttle itself when there's not enough work to do.\n\n*If the charger is offering more power to be delivered than the charging controller is being asked to provide to the CPU, you have excess power available.\n\n*When the battery needs replenishment and excess power is available, the energy will be applied there in the usual non-linear LiPo charge curve off fast charge to roughly 80 percent capacity then slow charge.\n\n*Newer iOS / iPadOS / macOS systems will delay charging in several cases where you opt in for slower charging in exchange for longer service life (overnight / when local power costs high / when it knows it can slow walk the charge and still be topped off / when you keep the device almost always on charge)\n\nBack to charging, the CPU can pull from two sources and the charger can deliver to two sources.\nIt’s a pretty simple systematic first glance, but the nonlinear charge and variable CPU/GPU loads make some linear time estimates (or back of the envelope manual calculations) not match reality.\nIf your charger is not providing the power needed to keep the CPU fully powered, the battery will drain and eventually the Mac will shut off because there’s no more battery to make up the deficit in power.  And that is why the CPU can run at full speed.\nI don’t think there is any general common timing even if you restrict yourself to only USB-C charging models. But, the great news is you can just open the terminal and check the current power budget and time estimates and not rely on me or anyone else rule of thumb on the internet.\n pmset -g sysloadlog\n pmset -g thermlog\n pmset -g pslog\n\nThose three commands show engineering summaries and details for the overview of the system state (sysloadlog) and the thermal CPU throttling (thermlog). The last power log will answer the specifics of any charge scenario for any model Mac and the charger you have connected.\nApple Silicon has slightly different power measurements. Try these two commands to start if you want to look at power / performance.\nsudo powermetrics -s cpu_power,gpu_power\nsudo powermetrics -s thermal\n\n\nA: This question is impossible to answer in the general. There simply does not exist such general timings.\nBasically a battery has a certain capacity for charge - usually rated in \"watt hours\" (Wh) or \"milli-amp hours\" (mAh). Essentially it contains a specific amount of energy. A new 16\" MacBook Pro has a battery that is roughly able to hold 100 Wh (watt-hours).\nA charger is able to constantly deliver a certain, maximum amount of energy. This is usually rated in watts. So a 100 watt charger that is charging the battery at maximum capacity for 1 hour will deliver 100 watt-hours.\nIt is not however so that the computer necessarily draws the maximum possible amount of power from the charger at all times. For example newer MacBook Pros support fast charging - the same 16\" MacBook Pro can do Fast Charging off a 140W charger. That allows it to reach up to a 50% charge in 30 minutes.\nThe battery charger controller in the computer decides how much power is drawn from the charger. In the same 16\" MacBook Pro, that is handled by a Renesas ISL9240 IC. It is able to very precisely decide how many milliamps to draw at a specific time.\nThe battery charger controller is instructed on this by an on-board microprocessor. The decisions take into accounts various factors such as a simple timers, temperature sensors, etc. If you charge the battery today and tomorrow - it might not follow the exact same pattern every time.\nNow to all this add the fact that the computer is drawing power from the battery while you're charging. Even when the CPU is at 0% load, the computer is still drawing a lot of power from the battery. The CPU also requires power at idle, but a lot of other components are continously powered as well - such as for example the display, memory, wireless interfaces, etc.\nThe amount of powered drawn is relatively unpredictable. It is not something you can generalize to any system.\nSo all in all, you might see in some instances that charging a battery from 0-100% takes the exact same amount of time when the CPU is loaded 0% as when it is loaded 100%. In order instances it will take a lot longer in the latter case - with the extreme being that that the battery never reaches 100% when the computer draws more power than is being delivered by the charger.\n", "Q: How can I cancel a pending payment in App Store? I have accidentally subscribed yearly to an app, and now I removed the subscription but they're still trying to take the payment (no sufficient funds). Can I cancel the payment anyhow?\n\nA: If you cancelled the subscription soon after you subscribed, and you explain it was an accident no payment should be taken.\nBear in mind that if you had a free trial before the subscription, and you don't cancel 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you may still be charged.\n\nSome subscriptions might offer a discounted or free trial.

If I would have an older version of Java JDK on my mac such as Java SE 8 or OpenJDK 8, what would be a quick way to upgrade to OpenJDK 11 using Homebrew (using the brew command)?\nMotivation for using Homebrew: Homebrew provides an easy way to do reproducible installation of a number of system tools (and makes it easier to undo mistakes).\n\nA: Recommended commands to install OpenJDK 11 from AdoptOpenJDK (with notes after the # sign):\nbrew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk # assuming this tap was not already added\nbrew cask install adoptopenjdk11 # this command *may* need a password to succeed\n\nNote that OpenJDK as used by AdoptOpenJDK is open source under GPL v2 license with a Classpath exception.\nThis answer assumes that a recent version of Homebrew is installed, with brew cask install enabled and working.\nAt this point, assuming that no newer version of Java or Java JDK is installed, java -version shows me openjdk version \"11.0.3\" and javac --version shows me javac 11.0.3 (with no JAVA_HOME environment variable in use).

I use SourceTree as a Git GUI tool. I'm very productive with the app and find it far preferable to the command line Git interface for common tasks.\nUnfortunately, SourceTree is incredibly slow, buggy, lacking features, and rarely updated. I would very much like to reduce my dependency on Atlassian's product.\nThe problem is that I'm heavily dependent on SourceTree's Split View Staging view of the staging area. This view perfectly fits my mental model of how a staging view should work.\n\nThis view allows individual lines, hunks, or single-character changes to be staged independently. Then, all of the currently staged changes are shown in a single pane of the split view. All of the unstaged changes are shown in the other pane.\nThis allows you to easily see exactly which changes are staged at any given time, and commit only those specific changes. A file can exist in both the staged and unstaged panes.\n\nWhat other macOS Git GUI app or tool offers a commit/staging view similar to Split View Staging offered by SourceTree?\nOne popular Git GUI app, GitHub Desktop, apparently has no plans to support Split View Staging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make staging line hunks more obvious #1688\n\nA: There are various free as well as commercial macOS Git GUI apps available as listed on Git SCM webpage. The listed tools differ in their performance and feature set. The list is a living document with new apps getting added over time.\nAs you are looking for a macOS app with support for granular staging/unstaging support, I'll list one free and one paid tool each here which I use/have used personally. I too am a heavy user of SourceTree, but keep up with it's minor annoyances.\n1. GitKraken (Free):\nGitKraken is a free macOS Git GUI client. Although it's not a native app, but it comes with extensive set of features. Along with adding new features, the team behind the client is constantly working on improving overall performance with frequent releases. It supports Split View Staging. More details here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Staging\n\nUnstage files by selecting a staged file and hitting the Unstage File button that appears. If you click on a file to view the diff, you can selectively unstage lines or hunks.\n\n\n\n2. Tower (Paid):\nTower is a paid macOS Git GUI client. It's a native macOS app with excellent UX and performance. It is quite popular among software developers. It supports Split View Staging. More details here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Chunk & Line Staging\n\nOne of the things that make Git such a great tool is the ability to craft granular commits. With Git's staging area, you can determine which changes exactly you want to have in the next commit. Tower takes this one step further by allowing you to determine the exact chunks and even lines you want to add:\nSelect a changed file in the Working Copy list. In the diff view on the right, you can then select the exact chunks & lines you want to add to the next commit.\n\n\nI personally use SourceTree and Tower.\nI'd recommend you to give the various tools mentioned on Git SCM webpage a try and choose as per your liking.\nNo affiliation whatsoever to any of the mentioned apps. I am on a constant pursuit to select and use the best tools available for the job at hand.\n\nA: I've been using Fork (https://git-fork.com/ - it's free for Mac and Windows) for almost 6 months now, after leaving SourceTree behind. I think it works incredibly well. Updates are not frequent, but they do happen. There are a few things missing from SourceTree (for example, I cannot see if my commit was signed with my GPG key - I have to run a git command in the terminal to check - but the option to have commits signed IS there and it does work, IF you remember to enable it for every repository), but I've been using it every day for 6 months without a single slowdown or problem. I routinely have two windows open, with about 30 tabs between the two.\nThe built-in merge tool is very nicely done as well. It is efficient and lets me pick between the two sides which lines to keep from which source. The wording is a little bit confusing to me, but that's mostly because I cannot seem to remember which side is \"mine\" and which is \"theirs\" when fixing a merge conflict.\nEdit: I should note that it has the ability to stage/unstage custom hunks. All you have to do is highlight the line(s) you want and click stage/unstage.\nHere's a screenshot of the changes tab, since Fork's website has everything except this:\n\n\nA: I personally use Sublime Merge. It has Stage File / Stage Hunk functionality you need. See a screenshot from their website:\n\nStaged and unstaged files are then displayed on one page as two separate lists of files.\nThis client seems quite fast, as well as well designed — my most used commands are within a few clicks. In addition, it is available for Windows as well, which is a benefit for me, as I code in both environments.\nCurrently, Sublime Merge can be evaluated for free for an unlimited period, with some minor limitations in functionality (e.g., no dark mode) and a sporadic popup asking to consider purchase (Sublime Text style).\n", "Q: Why doesn't spotlight return this file?

My personal computer, MacBook Pro, only has Thunderbolt 3 ports and this would require numerous expensive adapters in order for this method to work.\n\nA: I've transferred dozens of my own MiniDV cassettes so let me share the methods I used and what I think makes sense for you. I'll preface by saying that this was a project that took me DECADES to get started, precisely because there are so many options and variables to consider. However, once I began I did it all at once, and was relieved to do it. This is an investment of time and money, but one you'll agree is worthwhile for unlocking and securing your tapes' contents.\nFirst, to answer your question, if users were reporting that EasyCapViewer wasn't running well on El Capitan, then it almost certainly won't run well on Mojave. For what it's worth I downloaded EasyCapViewer and it launched without any errors on Mojave, but you can't know how it functions with that capture card hardware until you try it out. EasyCap isn't a 64-bit app, so it's definitely not optimized to run on modern versions of macOS like High Sierra or Mojave, but it does technically run. If you're dead-set on using that software, you could always get a copy of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, install it on a disk partition or external drive, and work with it from there. \nSecond, if your priority is to capture the highest quality of these videos, then my recommendation for you is to go the Firewire route, because it's the only option that transfers the pure digital signal from tape to Mac. If your intention is to archive and back up these tapes for posterity, you'll want to capture the highest quality version of that video, and Firewire is the only way to do that. But be aware that importing raw digital video can take up a lot of storage space, so depending on how many tapes you have you'll want to have a fair amount of disk space, and/or a backup drive to hold them all. The alternative is to important analog video, via this EasyCap tool or one of the many other options like it (there are many analog hardware and software tools just like EasyCap, so I encourage you to check those out if EasyCap doesn't sound like it has the support you're looking for). Just keep in mind that when you import analog video the video gets compressed, so you won't get the same quality video out of the analog transfer as you do with digital Firewire. You may not notice or care much about that difference, but just be aware that importing via analog will result in a loss of some quality that you would otherwise retain through a digital transfer. On the positive side though, since analog video files are compressed they do take up much less storage space.\nBack to Firewire: As you noted, this setup requires a few adapters. In your case you would need a Firewire Cable (assuming your camcorder takes the small 4pin plug, like mine did, you'll need a 4pin to 9pin Firewire 800 cable). Then depending on whether you have a USB-C hub for your Mac (some of which do offer Firewire 800 ports, or else Thunderbolt 2 ports) you'll need an Apple Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter. If you don't have a hub you'll also need to add an Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter to make the direct connection to your MacBook Pro. Like most Apple dongles, these are overpriced, but you can find the same products on Amazon or eBay for half that. \nEconomically, buying a hub and/or a bunch of adapters would probably cost more than just picking up an old used Mac, like a Powerbook G4, and doing the video transfer with that. It sounds crazy but you actually might consider this option, since those models have built-in Firewire and often come installed with Tiger or Leopard, which would also be compatible with the EasyCap. Oddly enough it could be less of a headache than trying to make all the old hardware/software fit with your new MacBook Pro.\nLastly, a note (and warning) on tape damage: be aware of the possibility that your tapes may have video/audio artifacts or disruption (several of mine had sections like this, and they were painful to watch). Hopefully yours don't have any, but if they do I'll just save you the trouble of investigating the Why: it can be connected to recording in LP instead of SP, or using different brands of tapes whose tape lubricant doesn't get along well with other tape brands. A corrupted digital signal can make those sections virtually unwatchable, and importing those clips via Firewire looks terrible. In that case the best alternative for importing those sections is to use an analog tool. The one I used was Elgato's EyeTV to import those damaged sections of video via S-video or Composite video. Importing damaged sections via analog isn't great either, in that it won't get rid of the artifacts, and for some reason it reduced my LR sound channels to mono sound, but the damaged sections do import better with analog than with digital, so I used analog imports exclusively for that purpose.\nI know this is a lot of info, but hopefully some of it is helpful for you. Good luck with your continued efforts!\n", "Q: Ways to access Apple Pay What are the possible ways to access Apple Pay as quickly and easily as possible on an iPhone SE in a shop? I am using iOS 12.\n\nA: Some ways are:\nFrom the lock screen - Go to Settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay and enable Double-Click Home Button. Now when you double-click on the lock screen your cards will appear. Then select your card and use Touch ID or hold it next to the reader. One of the quickest and easiest ways.\nSiri - You can access Apple Pay by saying \"Apple Pay\" to Siri.\nWallet App - Go to the wallet.app, click on your card at the top. Then when you rest your finger on the home button, it will authenticate it and search for a nearby reader.\nHolding it near the reader - When you hold your iPhone near a card reader it will automatically bring up your list of cards.\nYou might also want to check out Apple Pay.\n", "Q: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy' when installing robotpy-cscore When using pip to download

Never install the upgrade without confirming that the file is identical to the original Apple file. This is commonly done by taking an MD5 checksum of the file, and comparing it to the known good checksum.\nYou can find the MD5 checksum of a file by running the following command in the Terminal:\nmd5 filename\n\nwhere you replace \"filename\" with the actual name of the file, you want to checksum.\nThe md5 checksum looks something like this: ecfcaab9ad3d019ee982abdc84eff102 (just an example)\n", "Q: In Finder and Terminal — can not delete a folder, (Error = \"Directory not empty\") Anytime I've run up against this in the past, I was always able to figure it out, and usually via the command line.

Went through all the usual items (saved my stuff locally), etc., and somehow - when I logged back in, my trash was empty!\nOne of the things I wanted to share here with this forum / group, is that I learned something I hadn't known previously: Since the incarnation of iCloud, the PATH to my \"Trash\" folder no longer is (what it's always been)... /Users/myHomeDir/.Trash — instead, it was now: myHomeDir$ /Users/mike/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/.Trash/  — and I only learned this after searching that first path several times, both while logged in as myself (in Terminal), but also, while booted into Single User mode. Nowhere in either of those means, was my Trash directory located. But when I drag and dropped that  from my trash... to my terminal - that was the path it gave. (and confirmed this while logged into Single User).\nGo figure... sorry for the lengthy post, but wanted to be thorough in my resolution for anybody this might help.

Using all lower case will fail with an error message.\nTkinter is included with the built-in version of python on MacOS, so there must be some other problem on your Mac if Tkinter is not 'there'.\n\nA: The correct long term solution is to use python 3, however this requires the conversion of python code from version 2 to 3 and this is non trivial.\nAnother way is to install a version of python 2 that includes Tk. Python can be installed in several ways often by using a package manager like conda, Macports or Homebrew or directly from python.org. Normally for python use I would suggest using conda as it manages the installation and use of third party python packages, however in your case as you are just running scripts it might be easier to just use the python.org on.  \nThe latest version for python 2 is 2.7.15 but check that your $PATH has /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin otherwise you will still have the apple python as you have now.\n", "Q: Apple Watch mute only notifications and not alarms Is there a way to mimic the Do not Disturb mode found in the iPhone on my Apple Watch?\nI'd like to receive notifications but without any sound nor haptic feedback.

By actually visiting the website and seeing if it is up or not. Using a phone to do such tasks (assuming it is even possible) will likely eat up battery power and might even fail depending on how strong your local WiFi or cellular signal is. Remember you are running a background task that is always running in the background. A service that needs to use the WiFi/cellular radio. All of which have a cost in battery life.\nSo it is likely your best bet is an internet service that monitors websites.

In January 2019, i.e. about 9.5 months later, it had a battery failure and had to be replaced under warranty by Apple. This is not an isolated issue. I'm not looking forward to another failure in less than a year again, except it'll be out of warranty this time, so I'll have to pay out of pocket for a repair next time.\nIt's well known that batteries are consumables, and it's not expected that they'll last forever. On the other hand, to see Pencils failing (such as my own) before the warranty expires suggests that there is a design flaw in the Pencil.\nSide note, feel free to skip\nAs an electrical engineer with experience designing battery-powered devices, I have a theory regarding this design flaw:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Pencil's battery is very small (0.332 Wh, or about 90 mAh).\n\n*Point 1 by itself is not a problem, except the Pencil is an always-on device. Its internal accelerometer senses when it's moved, and it pairs to the iPad. If, like me, you throw the iPad and the Pencil in a backpack which you take around with you all day, it's going to be waking up quite often, and draining the battery in the process. I don't care what Jony Ive says, it really needed an on-off switch.\n\n*When a Li-Ion battery is drained beyond a certain threshold, it isn't safe to try to recharge it. Most battery protection ICs include undervoltage protection and turn off the charge MOSFET in series with the battery when this condition is detected.\n\n*When the Pencil reaches a low battery state (say at 5%), I assume it enters a very low power mode, disconnecting from the iPad, to save battery (if it doesn't, and the user doesn't immediately start recharging the battery, it will be irrecoverably dead in a few hours as per point 3).\n\n*However, even in a low power mode, there is some current drain from the battery -- unless you use a relay to cut power to the circuit, which Apple certainly didn't use in the Pencil. A good design might have a leakage current budget of about 10 µA. Unfortunately, going back to point 1, and considering that 5% of 90 mAh is 4.5 mAh (assuming it still holds 90 mAh of charge; over time it will be less, so adjust the figures downward correspondingly), a 10 µA drain would completely drain the battery after 450 hours, or about 19 days (less than 3 weeks).\n\n\nAs a consequence of point 5, if you leave your iPad unattended for a few weeks, you may come back to a dead Pencil. Apple realized this, which is why they made it easier to dock the 2nd generation Pencil to the iPad Pro, which keeps it permanently charged.\nAnother, completely unrelated issue, but which may also play a part: Apple implemented a fast charging protocol, since it only takes about 15-20 minutes to fully charge the Pencil starting from a discharged state, which suggests a C-rate of about 3C to 4C. This paper shows noticeably reduced battery cycle life at 1.2C and 1.4C compared to 1C, so extrapolating to 3C or 4C rates, I'm frankly surprised the battery lasts more than a few dozen cycles.\nIt is my theory that these two issues are responsible for most battery-related Apple Pencil failures.\nThe questions\nAll signs point to the Apple Pencil requiring constant attention to avoid killing the battery. On the other hand, I haven't found any reports of newly-bought Pencils being dead, so clearly they can stay on store shelves for weeks, possibly months, without the battery dying (although it surely helps that they're sitting still on the shelf before being sold).\nWhat measures can I take to ensure the maximum battery longevity of a Pencil?\nIn particular, can I revert the Pencil to a factory reset state, in which the battery drain is very low?\nCan I \"slow\"-charge the Pencil (say at 1C rate, therefore not slow at all) so as to prevent the hypothesized deterioration of the battery due to the default fast charge protocol?\nAre there apps to remind me to do this if I leave the Pencil paired for more than a few minutes without using it?\nNote: I will leave an answer describing the measures I took to try to prolong the lifetime of my current Pencil, although clearly they weren't enough, seeing as it died after 9.5 months. I'm looking for other measures to take to make sure the replacement lasts longer.\n\nA: Just after buying the Pencil, due to my use case detailed in point 2 of the side note in the question, I was getting the low battery message almost daily. Therefore, I searched the web for a way to get as close to a powered-off state in the Pencil as possible while it's not in use.\nRemoving Bluetooth pairing\nEventually I settled on going to Settings -> Bluetooth and unpairing the Pencil. When I needed to use it again, I just paired it again by taking out the cap and connecting its male Lightning connector to the female port in the iPad, then confirming the pairing when asked by the iPad.\nI tested this and it seems to hold charge much better. I could go a day or two without using the Pencil, and when connecting it again, it had lost no charge at all, or at most a couple percent.\nNeed for periodic charge level checks\nThe main issue is that you have to remember to unpair it after use every single time. I realized my Pencil had died after a few weeks without using it, and it's not entirely impossible that I just forgot to unpair the Pencil at the time. The only solution I can think of, for now, to this issue is to add a reminder to check the Pencil's battery charge level every so often -- at least weekly, I'd say, and ideally daily if you don't find that too bothersome.\nCharging tests\nAlso, I have performed charging tests with my replacement Apple Pencil, both sticking it directly into the iPad's Lightning port, as well as using the female-to-female Lightning adapter that comes in the Apple Pencil's box, which allows you to charge it from a regular USB-Lightning connector.\nI performed two nearly full charges, from 5% back to 100%, using the female-to-female Lightning adapter connected to an authentic Apple USB-A to Lightning cable, connected to an authentic Apple wall charger (not sure if the 5 W or 12 W model though). Between the wall charger and the USB-A to Lightning cable I connected a USB ammeter. I verified the charging rate to be approximately 0.05 A (unfortunately I don't think this is a very accurate ammeter, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if the actual current deviated from this measured value by 10 or even 20 mA). Most importantly, the charging time in both cases was about 1 hour and 20 minutes, indicating a theoretical 0.75C charging rate, possibly closer to 0.8C due to inefficiencies. Either way, this is a charge rate that probably shouldn't degrade the battery and reduce its lifetime.\nOn the other hand, charging with the Pencil directly connected to the iPad's Lightning connector, also starting at 5% and ending at 100%, took only 20 minutes to charge. This indicates a minimum charging rate of 3C, probably more given that fast charge is even less efficient (I wouldn't be surprised if the actual rate is 4C). For energy-optimized cells such as LiCoO2, this is an extremely high rate that is sure to lead to battery degradation, as explained in the question.\nSide note: there exist power-optimized cells with different chemistries such as LiMn2O4, and for these such high rates are not necessarily prejudicial. However, these batteries are heavier and larger than their LiCoO2 counterparts for the same capacity, so they're usually employed in specific applications such as power tools. Apple as expected doesn't disclose what chemistry they employ, but teardowns show that they go for LiCoO2 for most of their lineup, so it'd be slightly unusual for the Apple Pencil to deviate from this.\nRecommended battery maintenance procedure\nIn closing, I would recommend the following procedure as an attempt to maximize the Apple Pencil's battery lifetime:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unpairing the pencil in Settings -> Bluetooth after use;\n\n*Setting at the very least a weekly reminder (and if possible a daily reminder) to check the Pencil's battery level, just in case you forgot to unpair it;\n\n*When charging the Pencil, use the female-to-female Lightning adapter, connected to a Lightning cable, instead of charging directly from the iPad's Lightning connector. Use fast charging only when strictly necessary;\n\n*If possible, avoid keeping the battery's State of Charge permanently at 100% as it is somewhat harmful to the battery. 80% would be a huge improvement and 60% is ideal (no need to go below this.) -- a suggestion would be, after using the Pencil and when doing the weekly battery level check, connect it for a few minutes to the charger until the desired SoC is hit.\n\n\nA: There is an easier way to \"turn off\" the Apple Pencil, for both the 1st gen. and 2nd gen. You do not have to unpair the Pencil.\n\n*\n\n*Your Apple Pencil is working normally. Check \"Settings\" - \"Apple Pencil\" to see battery level, etc.\n\n*Go to \"Settings\" - \"Bluetooth\" and turn off Bluetooth. You can use the Apple Pencil to do this.\n\n*Turn Bluetooth back on again. The Apple Pencil will not turn it on now because it uses Bluetooth, so you'll have to use your finger.\n\n*Test the Apple Pencil. Touch the screen. Nothing will happen.\n\n*Use your finger to touch the \"Apple Pencil\" listing in \"MY DEVICES\". It will say, \"Apple Pencil Not Connected. Plug in Apple Pencil to use it with this iPad,\" for 1st gen. Pencils, and \"Apple Pencil Not Connected. Attach Apple Pencil to use it with this iPad,\" for 2nd. gen.\n\nYour Apple Pencil is now disconnected and turned off. You'll have to re-attach/plug it in again to turn it back on. There is no need to unpair the Pencil. I charge mine to 80% and do this Bluetooth cycle when I've finished using the Pencil, and it keeps its charge for months. It will still be 80% a month or two later.\nOne caveat in this: do not just \"turn off\" Bluetooth in the Control Center (swipe down from top right, touch blue Bluetooth icon turning it white). This just disconnects from (some) Bluetooth devices, but it keeps the Bluetooth connection with Apple Pencil. The battery will still slowly run down in this case. Go to \"Settings\" - \"Bluetooth\" and check that the \"Apple Pencil\" entry on MY DEVICES says, \"Not connected\" to confirm it is disconnected and off.\n", "Q: iMac late 2009 new ssd install So I’ve read through a lot of “new install” threads and all are pretty much the same...use internet recovery or cmd+r on boot up. \nBut here’s my issue. \nMy old hdd crashed so I don’t have anything to recover from.

I don't want to go snooping around in his phone looking at all his contacts so I don't know for sure.\nBut he has iMessage turned OFF so there's no way he can be sending it to their email using iMessage and he also doesn't have data so this is puzzling for us on why this is happening.\nI assume (again) that he connects to his work's WiFi which is how its actually sending via email, if you understand what I am saying.\nI've gone through the iMessage settings on the phone and found nothing on this. How can I fix this and stop the texts going to peoples emails for him?\nI've tried stuff on other posts but it didn't seem to work.\nFor example; someone said that when you create a new conversation with someone, you might have started a conversation with the email address and one with the phone number.\nThat didn't happen with him. There's only conversation and it doesn't say if its email or phone. Some times it goes to phone and sometimes it goes to email. (The text messages I mean)\n\nA: Given what you have said, the other people must be sending messages to your father from their email, so you will need to check what the other person's address/phone number is. If he wants to text them, and not email them, he will need their phone number and not email. I suggest you add a screenshot of the contact information of your father's friends, but it is likely the other person's Contact information includes an email but not a phone number.\n", "Q: Giving instructions to an executable in UNIX? I'm pretty new at this, so excuse me if this is too easy.\nThe thing is, I have a bunch of instructions stored in a text file named: 'FTIG_dldStruct.txt' and I want to write them all into an executable named: 'STP'. I wrote this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nset +H\n\n./STP # This is the executable\n\nfor i in {1..586} \n    do\n        sed -n -e \"$i\"p FTIG_dldStruct.txt\ndone\n\nMy program runs the executable, and it asks me for input like this:\nSTP> # I want the instructions here, but my for loop is not working until I exit the executable.\n\nA: It appears you want to send some number (586?) lines from FTIG_dldStruct.txt to the ./STP command? If so, assuming ./STP reads from standard input as is typical, that may look like:\nhead -n 586 FTIG_dldStruct.txt | ./STP\n\nAs pointed out in the comments to pass the entire contents of the file that would be:\n./STP < FTIG_dldStruct.txt\n\nVarious pipelines are also possible, perhaps to filter out comments (here arbitrarily defined as lines beginning with #) with grep:\ngrep -v '^#' FTIG_dldStruct.txt | ./STP\n\nIf you need ./STP to stick around after those commands are entered so the program can be interacted with, that's a more complicated issue and typically requires an expect script that in turn wraps around ./STP.\n#!/usr/bin/env expect -f\nset filehandle [open \"FTIG_dldStruct.txt\"]\nset maxlines 586\nspawn -noecho ./STP\nwhile {[gets $filehandle line] >= 0 && $maxlines > 0} {\n    # wait for prompt from program\n    expect -ex \"STP>\"\n    send \"$line\\r\"\n    incr maxlines -1\n}\n# turn interaction with the program over to the user\ninteract\n\nThis code would need to be saved to a file and made executable like any other script on unix. expect has also been made available as a library in various other programming languages.\n", "Q: How do I find and remove a download that was interrupted and is not in any downloads or cache folders?

I want to make 1920 x 1080 screenshots of the entire screen, but there's no 1920 x 1080 option in the Displays menu. \nThere's a 1920 x 1080 option on SwitchResX, but when I select that one, the text on the screen becomes slightly blurry. I suppose that happens because that ratio is not supported, therefore the monitor is stretching or compressing the screen. That said, there shouldn't be any blurriness because there's one black strip on top and one on the bottom of the monitor meaning the monitor is adjusting the size so there no need for stretching or compressing. \nAnyone know how to get a clear view in 1920 x 1080? \nI am using Macbook Pro 2016, macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nI set the resolution to 1280 x 800 in the Displays menu:\n\nHowever, when I take a screenshot of the entire screen, the produced image has a resolution of 2560 x 1600. \nIf I set the resolution to 1920 x 1200 on the Display menu, the produced screenshot will be 3840 x 2400. I also to set the resolution using the SwitchResX app instead of Displays, but I get the same behaviour.\nMy end goal is to get a screenshot of the entire screen in 1920 x 1080. How can I do that?\nP.S. I also need to capture screencast videos using Camtasia in that same resolution, but the same blurriness issue happens with videos.\nI am using Mac Pro 2016, macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\nA: The reason you're having problems is that you are currently using \"Retina-mode\". This means that the systems outputs a high resolution to the display, but makes it \"look like\" a lower resolution - which is what is stated on your screenshot. I.e. the display might \"look like\" 1280x800, but the actual resolution is 2560x1600.\nThe idea is that the system render text at a much higher resolution, but changes the font size to match, so that the output text is at the same physical size as if you had the low resolution, but it is displayed at the higher resolution meaning that it will be sharper, crisper and easier to read.\nIn order to change the real resolution to 1920x1080, you'll need to use SwitchResX and change the resolution to 1920x1080. However, take care that you choose the option that doesn't say \"HiDPI\" to the right. This is the name SwitchResX uses for Retina Mode. If you choose 1920x1080 at the bottom of the list where it is stated without HiDPI, you'll get that real solution - and screenshots are then taken with that resolution.\nDoing it this way introduces no artificial blurring, stretching or anything of the sort. Text and everything will be rendedered in 1920x1080 without modification. However, the text will not be as \"clear\" as when you're using Retina-mode - but you cannot expect more with a 1920x1080 resolution.\n", "Q: Prevent MacBook Pro from turning on by touching trackpad Recently got a new MacBook Pro and I really don't like the fact that it powers on by a simple touch on the trackpad. \n(EDIT: By \"powering on\", I mean powering on from a completely turned off state, after having hit \"Shut down...\", not waking up from sleep mode.) \nI'd like for it to power on only if I press the top right corner that corresponds to the finger print reader.\nIs there a way to do that?\nEDIT: to further clarify, some elements from the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*I should check again at home, but I've had my new MBP for more than a month now and unless I am missing something completely --- or I have been crazy for the last month --- clicking \"Shutdown...\", waiting for my computer to shutdown, and then clicking on the touchpad (or on any other key) actually turns the computer back on. \n\n*Now, maybe what happened is I never actually turned my computer off? Is there any setting that would make the computer not turn completely off when clicking \"Shutdown...\" ? \n\n*I guess what I would like is for my new MBP to behave more like my old Macbook air, i.e., 1) Actually fully shutdown when I click \"Shutdown...\", and 2) Only turn back on when I hit the \"power one\" button, which on the new MBP I always assumed was the \"touch ID\" button.\n\nA: Same situation here - shut down the MacBook 2018, then wait a few minutes, touch trackpad or any of the buttons and it starts booting up. Very annoying.\nFound the answer here Turn on (start up) your Mac Looks like it's the expected behavior. From their support page:\n\nAdditionally, MacBook Pro (2018) and MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018) turn on when you press any key on the keyboard or press the trackpad.\n\nWhich is exactly my case.\n\nA: Ok, following Sam's recommendation, I have tried to force shut it down using the touch id button. \nIn that case, the MBP behaved as expected, i.e., it would only turn back on using the touch id button again, and would not turn back on by a simple touch on the trackpad or by pressing a key on the keyboard.\nEDIT: after a couple more tries, it appears I was mistaken, in the sense that even force shutting down the laptop does not actually solve the problem (see the discussion in the follow-up question Why won't my new MBP actually shutdown when I click \"Shutdown...\" in the \"apple\" menu).\nUnfortunately, the issues remain that when I click on \"Shutdown...\" in the \"apple\" menu, the laptop does not seem to fully shut down. It looks as if it does (turns black). But then a simple touch on the trackpad or a hit on any of the keys \"wakes it up\", as if it had been turned off and was powering on again (it goes through the black background screen with the white apple in the middle and the progress bar).\nThis, unfortunately, has nothing to do with how long I wait between clicking \"Shutdown...\" and pressing a key or the trackpad: This has happened many time after waiting the whole night between clicking \"Shutdown...\" and pressing on the trackpad. In fact, I have clicked \"Shutdown...\" many times in the last month without ever having to press the touch id to power my laptop on: I always simply pressed on the trackpad, which made me believe this was the new normal with MBP and triggered my asking of this question.\nAnyways, I feel now like the issue is separate from the question I asked (i.e., my real issue seems to be that my laptop fails to actually shutdown when clicking \"Shutdown...\", which is different from what I described). So I decided to ask another question about it: Why won't my new MBP actually shutdown when I click \"Shutdown...\" in the \"apple\" menu\nUPDATE: For a couple of weeks, I've been using another MBP with a wider screen (I believe 15in as opposed to 13in) but bought around the same time.\nIt's really weird, this one seems to have a feature where the clicking of the trackpad is blocked (I mean physically blocked, with an actual resistance) until the laptop is turned on using the fingerprint button. This is not something my smaller screen MBP had (there, you could always click on the trackpad).\nThis gives a clear --- if somewhat weird --- indication that the laptop is actually fully shut down as opposed to sleeping.\n", "Q: MacBook Air randomly reboots Background\nMy wife has a 13\" early-2014 MacBook Air which is left open and connected to the charger, running all the time. Periodically, I check that it's still on.\nA couple of weeks ago, I started noticing, during these periodic checks, that it had randomly rebooted. This even seems to be corrupting data on the SSD, since the Dock appears to have gone back to its default state after one of these reboots. At one point, Disk Utility was showing errors, which I only managed to fix by going to Single User Mode. This suggests it's not a clean reboot at all.\nBefore the problem started, it was running macOS 10.13 and nagging me to update to 10.14. After the problem started, I decided to upgrade to 10.14 to see if the problem would go away -- it didn't. Yesterday I started up in Internet Recovery mode and reinstalled 10.14 (I didn't format the drive, just installed on top of the existing installation). I left the computer running yesterday night, and when I checked up on it today, it had rebooted.\nPrevious shutdown causes\nHere is the output of log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Previous shutdown cause\"' --last 45d:\nFiltering the log data using \"composedMessage CONTAINS \"Previous shutdown cause\"\"\nSkipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.\nTimestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    TTL  \n2019-01-12 17:25:22.864460-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-14 12:32:49.888312-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-15 17:35:21.823709-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-16 14:53:30.840756-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-17 11:57:39.851521-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-17 17:47:47.838771-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-19 07:52:35.923043-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-19 09:27:15.920187-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-20 10:13:24.824075-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-23 23:00:12.859981-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2019-01-25 11:16:21.884785-0200 0xa3       Default     0x0                  0      0    kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLog      - Default:         11, Info:                0, Debug:             0, Error:          0, Fault:          0\nActivity - Create:           0, Transition:          0, Actions:           0\n\nAccording to a list of shutdown causes, code 3 is a hard shutdown, such as when holding the power button for a few seconds. This is very strange, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nobody performed this force shutdown procedure on the computer (to wit, a few of these shutdowns happened while nobody was at home, since we were traveling)\n\n*After a force shutdown, the computer is supposed to stay off unless you go and press the power button to turn it on again. Yet, when I went to check on the computer, it was already on (in a rebooted state, but on nevertheless).\nI should note that the computer was cleanly rebooted quite a few times during the period shown above: as I mentioned, I upgraded to 10.14, later reinstalled 10.14, and also rebooted several times to try to solve an SSD issue that Disk Utility wouldn't repair (eventually fixed by going to Single User Mode). Yet none of these showed up in the log -- perhaps \"regular\" shutdowns are purged from the log after a while?\nOutput of pmset -g log\nI ran pmset -g log and tried to correlate with the shutdown times above.

After pressing the power button to turn the computer back on, it showed the regular resume screen and went back to the exact state it was before hibernation, so I presume this isn't an issue either.\n\n*Sometimes the charger is disconnected for a few minutes to clean the room. If the battery was failing, which wouldn't be so unusual in a computer this old, it might shutdown due to a power failure (although I find it hard to believe it would reboot instead). Still, to rule this out, I checked CoconutBattery, which reports that the battery was manufactured in August 2014, has 89 charging cycles on it, still holds 96.9% of its design capacity, and \"macOS Battery status\" is \"Good\", so I don't see any reason to suspect the battery. Also, in the last hour I have been using the computer unplugged from the charger, and it didn't reboot.\n\n\nThe questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there other, more detailed sources of information regarding the reboot cause?\n\n*What else could shutdown cause 3 mean, apart from holding the power button until the system forcefully shuts down?\n\n*What else can I try to do to figure out the cause, or try to fix the issue?\n\nA: I've encountered this previously with customers of mine. The Mac has two different sleep modes, sleep (powers down most everything besides the RAM, wakes instantly), and hibernate (writes RAM contents to sleepimage file, powers down everything, delay in wake due to loading of sleepimage contents back into RAM). By default, the Mac first enters sleep, and then after some time enters hibernation and then powers down. As you've experienced -- due to a number of possible issues beyond the scope of this post -- the process isn't always foolproof.\n1st, let's get rid of a possibly corrupted existing sleepimage file. Normally, it's protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection) and not removable by a user without disabling that first (don't worry, we'll re-enable it afterwards):\n\n\n*\n\n*shut down your Mac\n\n*boot into Recovery Mode by pressing-and-holding Command-R and pressing the power button\n\n*keep holding down Command-R until you see the Apple Logo\n\n*upon observing the main menu of options, open Terminal under the Utiiity menu and issue the following command: csrutil disable\n\n*reboot your Mac & log in\n\n*in Terminal, issue the following command: sudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\n*enter an administrator's login password to authenticate\n\n\n2nd, we'll want to reset the SMC. This controls things like power & sleep/wake settings, and also re-enables SIP:\n\n\n*\n\n*shut down your Mac again\n\n*unplug any peripherals or USB devices from your Mac\n\n*plug the AC adapter in, and ensure you see the green or orange LED lit to indicate power is being received by your Mac\n\n*press & hold down the left shift, control, and option keys with your left hand, and press the power button once with your right\n\n*observe the LED change colors briefly to indicate the SMC has been reset\n\n*release the keys held down with your left hand\n\n*press the power button again to boot your Mac back up\n\n\nLastly, boot your Mac back up, log in, and we'll need to do one more thing. This should stop your Mac from powering off when it's been asleep (this also disables hibernation mode):\n\n\n*\n\n*in Terminal, issue the following command: sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\n\n*enter an administrator's login password to authenticate\nNow attempt to re-create your issue.\nNote that resettting of the SMC will reset your sleep/wake/hibernate settings back to default (or whatever you have modified via Energy Saver preference pane in System Preferences. Also, any malfunctioning USB, Thunderbolt, or SD card equipment attached to your Mac may interfere with sleep/wake and power states, so I'd advise keeping everything else unplugged (aside from AC power) while testing.\nBonus info: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode n where n=0, 3, or 25 will change hibernation modes. 0 disables it (\"normal\" sleep only), 3 is default (sleep after whatever time you've set in Energy Saver, then switch to hibernate mode), and 25 always hibernates. You can view current settings via pmset -g.\n", "Q: Can I sidestep a red line spelling checker in words other than English? In macOS there appear words that are underlined in red if the spelling is wrong. However, I started to learn French and only found that French words that are spelled correctly have he red underlines because there are no such words in English.\nIs it possible not to apply the spelling check on French words? I added French on the Language and Region setting on System Preferences but still have the underlines...\n\nUPDATE\nHere is the result of adding Français to the list.\n\nBut the preferences on text at keyboard looks like the following:\n\nThe relevant item is in the middle and it reads as Based on languages spell automatically.\nAnd French words still have the underlines.\n\nThis is on Note.app and on macOS 10.14.3.\n\nA: Language and Region doesn't really have anything to do with spelling in MacOS.  Instead go to System Preferences/Keyboard/Text/Spelling and set the language there, plus maybe in Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar if necessary.\nSome non-Apple apps like Word have their own independent spelling settings.\nIf you need to do both languages at once, you can try the Automatic setting in Spelling, after going to the Setup item and checking the boxes for just those two languages.  How well this works in practice you will have to determine by testing with your particular text.\nA better solution would be to use a more advanced app like Pages or Word, where you should be able to set the language of individual text runs so that the right spell check is used for each.\nI think it may work better in iOS.  If you have such a device, activate the French and English keyboards and dictionaries.  My initial test indicates it handles a text like yours correctly. \n\nA: In this case, the built-in spell checker is failing and not much can be done.\nI found an application called Spelling Corrector 7.1 by Alpha Omega Software which does offer this.\nI am not affiliated with this software.\nIt offers instant spell checking in multiple languages including French:\n\nYou need a spelling corrector to check the spelling of the words you use in your documents? You want to perform instantaneous spelling checking in Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and many other languages?\n  Then Spelling Corrector is what you need!\n\nNote if you install it:\n\nUnder Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra, if you're launching the Application for the first time, Mac OS' GateKeeper (which you can configure in the \"System Preferences\") will refuse to launch it because you've not downloaded it from the Mac App Store (but from our website). In this case, instead of double-clicking on it, all you have to do is to right-click on the Application's icon, and then select the \"Open\" menu. A message will appear in which you'll be able to confirm that you want to launch the Application (even if it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store from an Identified Developper).\n\nYou can download the .dmg file here and the .zip file here.\n", "Q: How can I open certain links in Google Chrome, which is not my default browser?

That is, the hostname is automatically appended to the X11 window title when it is running on a remote system. I am running programs on multiple remote systems and I need to tell them apart.\nExample: Note the hostname in the title of the window on the right. \nI would like to have the same behavior from a mac client.\n(I am not looking to change the terminal title.)\nWorkaround: xdotool can be used to manually change the title of an x window.\nssh -Y foohost\n...\nbar-gui &\npid=\"$!\"\n# Wait for bar-gui to actually load\nwin=$(xdotool search --pid \"$pid\")\nxdotool set_window --name \"bar-gui (on foohost)\" \"$win\"\n\nThis workaround is not ideal so I'm not making it an answer. It needs xdotool installed to work. This would not work great as a bash script or function. There are possibly better ways to use xdotool, but this was the first thing I got working.\nNote: Doing ... --name \"bar-gui (on foohost)\" ... from a linux desktop would cause the title to appear as \"bar-gui (on foohost) (on foohost)\" because it still appends the hostname automatically. \nI am still looking for the mac desktop to automatically include the hostname of remote x11 applications in the window title. \n\nA: This depends on shell configuration and the exact terminal involved; most things support XTerm Control Sequences though terminals can be configured to deny the use of those escape sequences. What Linux systems often have is shell configuration (usually under /etc/profile.d) that automatically runs the escape sequence to set the title to the hostname. This can also be done manually:\nprintf \"\\033]2;this is a test\\007\"\n\nwhich should set the title\n\nif not, you'll need to configure the terminal to allow that escape sequence, which will be under the preferences or in a configuration file somewhere, depending.\nThis can be done automatically from a shell configuration file by generating the appropriate escape sequence with the hostname (or whatever other data you might want):\nprintf \"\\033]2;%s\\007\" $(hostname)\n\n", "Q: How to make a Macbook Pro lock and not sleep when connected to power?

On my old phone, I've got settings -> icloud -> messages enabled. When I check iPhone storage on my old device, I can see that messages takes up 1.7GB.\nWhen I first enabled the same Messages switch on my new device I did get a progress bar saying 'Downloading Messages from iCloud'. I waited for maybe 15 minutes but it seemed that not much happened and stupid me did go to the settings -> icloud -> messages and disabled it. My thought was to then turn it back on again too see if it somehow got stucked and this maneuver would fix the problem.\nAt this time, while disabling it, I got a message telling me 'Messages have not been fully downloaded, tap Disable and Download Messages'. I'm not even sure what this means but I did disable it.

Check the box  \"Enable Messages in iCloud\" and then click \"Sync Now\".  Make sure that your keychain is active on both the MacBook and iphone. The sync took more than 12 hours and I had to keep syncing a few times to make sure it was complete. I then left my iphone plugged in overnight with wifi and all my old messages appeared. \n\nA: I had the same situation, nothing worked until I tried to SEND a message from my new device.

Can anyone provide a worked example of how to obtain the relevant cookies for Youtube and put it in the appropriate format for youtube-dl?\nContext: I want to download a private Youtube video.  For various reasons, the method of logging into my Google account is complicated and involves two-factor authentication and not supported by youtube-dl's existing command-line options.  Therefore, it seems the best way is to log in manually in my browser, obtain the authentication cookies somehow, and use the --cookies option -- but I can't find a worked example of how to do this.\n\nA: This answer doesn't require an extension and is mostly automatic.\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Shift+I to open Web Developer Tools\n\n*Select the Console tab at the top of the Web Developer Tools window\n\n*Copy this code into the console input and press Enter\n(function() {\n  let S = '# Netscape HTTP Cookie File\\n';\n  for (raw_cookie of document.cookie.split(';')) {\n    let cookie = raw_cookie.trim();\n    let separator = cookie.indexOf('=');\n    let name = cookie.substring(0, separator);\n    let value = cookie.substring(separator + 1);\n\n    let domain = window.location.hostname;\n    // hopefully this will convert domains like `www.test.com` and `test.com` into `.test.com`\n    domain = domain.replace('www.', '.');\n    if (domain[0] !== '.') {\n        domain = '.' + domain;\n    }\n\n    // netscape cookie file format:\n    // # domain  HTTP PATH SECURE timestamp name  value\n    // .test.com TRUE /    FALSE  123456789 token 1234abcdef\n    S += `${domain}\\tTRUE\\t/\\tTRUE\\t0\\t${name}\\t${value}\\n`\n  }\n\n  console.log(S)\n})();\n\n\n\n*Right-click on output and select Copy Message\n\n*Create cookies.txt and paste output there\n\n*I also had to delete the last line which said something like this: debugger eval code:21:11\nI've tested this method with Firefox on twitch.tv and successfully used the resulting file with youtube-dl 2021.06.06\nPS: Don't forget to remove HttpOnly attributes from the cookies before running the function (in Chrome: DevTools>Application>Cookies>{URL}, uncheck the checkboxes in HttpOnly column).

You can use this option\n                                 multiple times\n\nCookies are ultimately just submitted to the server as HTTP headers, so all you have to do is set the Cookie header on the request. This method is also quite a bit easier than extracting a cookie jar from a modern browser, especially since those tend to be encrypted and people often turn to questionable 3rd party tools to extract that data.\nHere is a usage example:\nyoutube-dl --add-header \"Cookie:COOKIE_STRING_EXTRACTED_FROM_BROWSER\" \"https://website-that-hosts.example/the-video-you-want\"\n\nTo extract the value of the cookie header:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the website you wish to download from\n\n*Log in\n\n*Open your browser's network inspector\n\n*Reload the page\n\n*Find the very first request made to that website and click on it, then view the headers for the request\n\n*Copy the entire string value of the Cookie header, highlighted in this image:\n\n\n*Paste that value into the example command above to replace COOKIE_STRING_EXTRACTED_FROM_BROWSER (inside the quotes)\nThis works well to download full episodes from sites that require cable provider login.\n\nA: This approach doesn't require installing any browser extension, which could pose a security risk, as @bgentry also pointed out.\nIt requires a terminal window, Node.js, and this open-source script I published.\n\n*\n\n*Download the script (or clone the repo if you prefer)\n\n\n*In an editor, open a new blank file\n\n\n*In Chrome/Chromium, launch Developer Tools (F12)\n\n\n*Navigate to the site you need cookies from, e.g. YouTube, and log in.\n\n\n*Go to Application -> Storage -> Cookies\n\n\n*For each URL under Cookies (e.g. https://www.youtube.com), copy the table of cookies into the clipboard, then paste it at the end of the file you've opened in step 2.

I am planning to buy a 2017 MacBook Pro base model (8 GB RAM/128 GB SSD) for iOS app development and I am on a budget.\nI would appreciate if I get answer to the following questions before I decide to purchase:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does current version of Xcode (10.1) and iOS Simulator run smoothly without lag on this Mac? or do I need more RAM and SSD and more powerful CPU?\n\n*How fast the 128 GB SSD fills with Xcode project files if I use the machine only for app development purpose?\n\n*Can I move old Xcode project files to an external disk in order to free up space on internal drive (and copy old Xcode project files back to internal drive as needed)?\n\n*Can I directly save and run Xcode project files from external disk without using the internal drive?\n\nA: 2017 MacBook Pro is a fairly recent model and supports running the current iOS development tooling (recent version of macOS, current version of Xcode + iOS SDK + iOS Simulator) pretty decently.\nHowever, how smoothly does Xcode run is a subjective question. As mentioned, the MacBook is pretty recent and can handle the iOS development environment fairly well. The actual performance is dependent not on the hardware alone, but also on the optimization level of the software (macOS + Xcode), which are fairly well optiized in general.\nWhile the machine configuration (Memory, CPU, disk space) required for optimal performance is highly dependent on the actual workflow i.e., the kind of project you'll be working on, it's generally a good idea to go with as much RAM as you can budget for as it's not upgradable at a later stage.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Does current version of Xcode (10.1) and iOS Simulator run smoothly without lag on this Mac? or do I need more RAM and SSD and more powerful CPU?\n  \n\nThis is subjective and dependant on the complexity of the project. In general Xcode will run decently on this configuration.\n\n\n  \n*How fast the 128 GB SSD fills with Xcode project files if I use the machine only for app development purpose?\n  \n\nThis is again subjective as it's dependent on the size of project.\n\n\n  \n*Can I move old Xcode project files to an external disk in order to free up space on internal drive (and copy old Xcode project files back to internal drive as needed)?\n  \n\nYes. Xcode project is a entirely contained in a single directory. As long as you keep all the project referenced files in the same location (generally inside the project directory), you can freely move around the directory between internal and external drive.\n\n\n  \n*Can I directly save and run Xcode project files from external disk without using the internal drive?\n  \n\nYes, you can save/run Xcode project from an external drive. However, the drive needs to remain connected for the duration of work.\n", "Q: 2011 MacBook Pro display shows vertical lines and then reboots My 2011 MacBook Pro boots up fine, but once I began working, no matter what is it that I am doing, the laptop display malfunctions, and eventually shows vertical black and white lines, followed by the laptop rebooting.\nIs this the indication of failing graphics card? How do I diagnose/resolve?\n\nA: \nIs this the indication of failing graphics card?\n\nIt could be, yes. The reboot is most likely a kernel panic due to the failing GPU. This, along with the screen distortion, constitute classic signs of failure. It's not the only possible diagnosis though. Though unlikely, it could still be that your GPU is fine and the Display is broken. \n\nHow do I diagnose?\n\nAs soon as you log in, take a screen shot. If the distortion appears on your screenshot, then the problem is with your graphics processor and you to get your logic board replaced. If the distortion does not appear on the screenshot, then the issue is with your display and you need to get your display replaced. \n\nHow do I resolve?\n\nThis is either a graphics processor issue or a display issue. I highly suspect the former. Either way, it is a hardware issue for which no online troubleshoot exists. Since this machine is well out of the warranty (and AppleCare) timeframe, it would cost $500-1000 to fix it directly through Apple if you elect to do so.

When I say \"still\", I'm not actually talking about current generation Macs. I'm specifically talking about 2012's. Is there still benefit to installing matched pairs or are those days long gone? \nI have two 2012 Macs with 4 GB each. I just got my hands on 8 GB from a 2012 iMac. So the question is, which Mac do I upgrade to 8 GB?\n...but I could also do 2 GB + 4 GB in each Mac, bringing each Mac to 6 GB. \nWay back when, it was always said to install in matched pairs, otherwise the RAM run's \"slow\". But is this still the case by 2012? Even if it is true, just how much slower is it? It still may be worthwhile to run unmatched pairs to get an extra 2 GB in each machine. \n\nA: No - even in the core 2 days, it was almost always faster to have more RAM that wasn’t matched compared to less RAM that was matched. I believe the penalty was 3% range - so you could test it in a benchmark, but real world - more RAM wins.\nThe only way matched ram would matter was in a perfect tie. Say two chips of 4 compared to four chips of 2. Always go with more RAM when you have capacity unless you are on a power budget - mobile devices on battery have to power all RAM and if you provision too much, you waste battery. \nThese days, the memory controllers are so good, I don’t think you can even benchmark differences due to a mix of memory sizes or locations.\n", "Q: How to determine if the graphics card is at fault on an iMac?

Also I have a VPN (OpenVPN, TUN mode) server on my local network running on a Raspberry Pi. If I connect to my local network through the VPN I can access local resources, like shared disks, but AirPrint printer does not show up.\nHow can I connect to my printer over VPN?\n\nA: I've spend quite a bit of time by trying to proxy Bonjour traffic over VPN, but in the end the Bonjour/mDNS traffic could be sent only over the TAP VPN, which is not supported by iOS.\nBut you can manually (by IP, not via Bonjour autodiscovery) add printer to iOS. This option is available only via configuration management:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Apple Configurator 2 from the Mac AppStore\n\n*Connect your iOS device\n\n*Create New Profile\n\n*Choose AirPrint and fill in your printer configuration.\n\n*Save this profile\n\n*Select your device, press Add->Profile and install the profile you've just created\n\n*Now your iOS device would check for the printer's IP directly, bypassing AirPrint's autodiscovery. This method would work via VPN or when you are directly connected to a local network\n\n", "Q: If I use Safari in full-screen mode, I can’t open a new window via keyboard shortcut unless I simply toggle the “File” menu. Bug or feature? I just discovered this odd issue in Safari 12 under macOS Mojave (10.14). It might exist in older versions of macOS but I didn’t start using full-screen—and Mission Control—in earnest until around macOS Mojave (10.14). And it’s reproducible from my experience across multiple macOS installs between my personal machines, the Apple store machines and even on my work computer.\nOpen up Safari, click the green dot in the upper left-hand corner to make this screen fullscreen and then hit the key combo for a new window in full-screen mode: Option+Command+N. Nothing happens.\nNow move your mouse over to the “File” menu in Safari and just toggle it. With that done, hit the key combo for a new window in full-screen mode again: Option+Command+N. It works! Not only that, it works from that moment forward without any toggling of the “File” menu dance.\nIs this a bug or a feature? If it’s a bug, how can I report it to Apple? If it’s a feature… Why is this desired functionality?\n\nA: This is a known issue at Apple and after nearly 2 years — and two major macOS updates — it still has not been addressed.\nFor anyone still frustrated by this seemingly basic issue, it still exists in Safari 14.0.1 running on macOS Bug Sur 11.0.1 (20B29). That means this issue has survived two full major macOS releases and two major Safari updates.\nAdditionally, I reported this issue on Apple’s official feedback (bug tracking) system on Mar 20, 2019 and it was closed it on Mar 25, 2019 as follows:\n\nApple\nMar 25, 2019 at 11:21 AM\nEngineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.\nThe open or closed status of the original report your bug was duplicated to appears in a text box within the bug detail section of the bug reporter user interface.

I traveled from Saudi Arab to Bangladesh and i wanted to add the billing information with my Bangladeshi Number.  It seems that the Payment method doesn’t have my country listed.How do i add my country ( i.e. Bangladesh)?\nimage\n\nA: Apple lists the countries where services are available when you choose your location.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/choose-country-region/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/\n\n*https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability/\n\n*etc...\n\nAs of January 2019, the only Apple Features offered in Bangladesh is Maps and Satellite Maps. Also, keep in mind that the features are enabled in almost all cases based on the region where you purchase the device, so if your phone was purchased in Saudi Arabia and then used in the US - you might retain all the Saudi restrictions despite your attempt to change. App Store and other services for billing purposes typically are more flexible and you can take advantage of them when you move about.\n\nMy speculation and research why Bangladesh isn’t listed is due to Apple not obtaining some rights from the government or is in the process of obtaining them.\n\nIn order to run an iTunes store in any given country, Apple has to secure licensing rights for the content, legal rights from the local government, payment processes, and numerous other legal hurdles. Either Apple hasn't applied for those rights yet, or they're in progress, but the size of the user base as well as the ease (or otherwise) of doing business in any given country are the driving factors here.\nYou can add your voice via Apple's feedback page here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html but at the end of the day you can be the most ardent, vocal fan in the world, but if the Bangladesh government don't give the licenses to operate, it all means nothing.\n\n(Source)\n", "Q: Crash during Boot Camp restoration.

The value is shared across all user accounts. 10 months ago, that number was 544 million on my system according to this old question of mine: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/320967/15281\nThe effect of this is that, for some apps, there is a noticeable (4 to 5 seconds) delay whilst they do something before their restored windows appear. My workaround, see the above linked question, is to turn off window saving for those specific apps. But I'd rather not have to do that. \nSo, I'd like to reset the restorecount value at its source. Does anybody know where it is stored and/or how can I reset it?\n\nA: The end value is not the number of windows you have opened, it is a Cocoa timestamp. 570214618 corresponds to January 26, 2019 4:56:58 PM GMT. As far as I can tell, the purpose of restorecount.plist is just to track how long it takes to restore the windows.\nFor apps that are taking a long time to start, you can try cleaning out their saved application state and see if that helps, but there are lots of other reasons an app might take a long time to start. The most common reason an app takes a long time to start is that it needs a lot of memory and you are already using all the available RAM so some memory needs to be compressed or written to disk in order to free up memory for the app. You can get a sense of this by looking at the \"memory pressure\" in the Activity Monitor.\nYou can also look at the amount of Swap Used (also in Activity Monitor). If that number goes up when you launch an app, then not having enough free memory is definitely a source of delay. \n", "Q: Why can’t I redownload Minecraft when I deleted it I paid for Minecraft on the App Store. I accidentally deleted it and now I can’t get it back. I signed into all 3 of my accounts but it always says minecraft costs money. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Some reasons why this could be. \nYou changed your country or region:\n\nIf you previously changed the country or region of your Apple ID, you might not see all of your past purchases.\n\nAlso try:\n\nIf you can't find an item that you want to redownload, check your purchase history to make sure that you purchased it with the Apple ID that you're signed in with. If not, sign in with a different Apple ID.\n\nYour purchases could be hidden:\n\nIf you don't see items in your \n  purchase history on other Apple IDs, \n  check to see if the purchases are \n  hidden. If your purchases are hidden, \n  you might not see them even after you \n  follow the steps in this article.\n\nAdditionally if the purchase was part \nof a Family Sharing group and you \nhave been removed from it you can’t \nre-download it. \n\nA: I believe that the App Store nor Mojang are aware if you delete Minecraft, therefore if you try to download it again - and they do not know that you had it already - they will try to charge you. If you try to tell them (either Mojang or App Store) that, they will probably charge you anyway because they will (both) do whatever they can to make themselves money. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Airdrop showing wrong name I have an iPad Pro running version 12.1.1.

The\n               re_format(7) manual page fully describes both formats.\n\nIn this case your find command will look like: \nfind -E ~/Library -regex '.*(citrix|cisco).*' -print 2>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: How do I play my music library on a Chromecast TV? How do I play the music in my Music app on a Chromecast TV? In the YouTube app, I can select to play a video to Chromecast. In Pandora, I can select to play a channel to Chromecast. In the music app, I can select a connected Bluetooth device as the output channel. But there is not an option to play music in the Music app to Chromecast. How can I play music from the Music app to Chromecast? Does it require a separate Google music app or something?\niOS 10.3.3.\n\nA: Casting to a Chromecast generally does not involve your device streaming to the Chromecast - you need to run some sort of server to stream from a local computer (or the Chrome extension that mirrors a computer screen to the Chromecast.) \nWhen you use apps on iOS to cast, it just tells the Chromecast where on the internet to stream from - and the internet service must support Chromecast.\nSo what you want to do with your music app can’t be done. Depending on where you keep your music there may be some solutions. For example, if you have a computer with your music on it, you could install Plex as a server, and the Plex app on your iOS device.\n", "Q: How does Disk Utility repair corruption? How does Disk Utility repair corruption?\nWhen you run First Aid, it logs things like \"checking fsroot tree\", checking the EFI jumpstart record\", etc. How does it know if something is broken, like does it have a correct version to compare things to? What if the correct reference gets corrupted as well?\n\nA: I have often asked myself, if a disk or volume is corrupt. And, if so, would I be better off backing up files before or after running repair software. In other words, could the repair destroy a file that otherwise could have be copied. Therefore, I would like to separate the detection for corruption from the possible repair of corruption. Depending on the version of OS X/macOS, the Disk Utility may or may not offer this option.\nThe Disk Utility basically runs the command diskutil repairdisk device, where the device is usually disk followed by an positive integer. If you right click on a drive shown in the Disk Utility and select \"Get Info\", the device is the \"BSD device node\" shown in the popup.\nOlder versions of OS X/macOS allowed you to select a disk verification. This option was eliminated from the Disk Utility in the latest versions of macOS. However, you can still run disk verification by entering the command diskutil verifydisk device in a Terminal application window. Again, you will need to replace device with the appropriate \"BSD device node\".\nYou can also apply the same to just a volume. You will need to replace repairdisk and verifydisk with repairvolume and verifyvolume. Also the device will usually be disk, an positive integer, the letter s and finally another postive integer. For example, disk0s2.\n\nA: You’ll find lots of detail about DiskUtility at Wikipedia. There is a lot of information here which I found interesting.\nBecause of the depth and breadth of what DiskUtility does, it would be complicated to answer fully. \nFor those moderators who dislike link-only answers, (and I’m one of them,) I feel that this Wikipedia link will suffice, however, because Wikipedia is not likely to ever disappear in our lifetimes. If it does disappear, we have more to worry about. \n", "Q: GUI trash different from terminal trash On Mac OS X El Capitan (MacBook Pro Mid 2014) it seems that visiting the trash bin from the GUI produces a bunch of files however visiting .Trash user$ and running ls -a only produces a single file. Why would this be the case? I'm assuming the GUI defines the trash bin to be different from the terminal? If so could someone explain these definitions to me. Thanks so much\n\nA: Each volume has its own trash, identified by user, in addition to the trash in your home directory. Trash shown in the dock is the aggregation of all of them.\nSo, in your $HOME you'll fine a .Trash, as will each user.

I keep accidentally hitting the trackpad while typing. None of the solutions in this question still work. Does an updated solution exist?\n\nA: The simplest solution I've found which works on any recent version of MacOS is turn off tap to click in System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click.\nYou can use this applescript to quickly toggle tap-to-click on and off. On MacOS open Applications > Utilities > Script Editor and paste the code from this script:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"trackpadTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 3 of tab group 1 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nThen select File > Export and save in Applications but also make sure to select File Format > Application before saving. \nIf you want to make it very easy to run the toggle on and off, you may want to add a custom keyboard shortcut which would just run the toggle application.\n", "Q: Mac Air 13” Wi-Fi Hardware Issue I have a MacBook and the other day i spilled a little bit of water on to it, nothing big or anything i soaked it up with the towel. The next day it would not turn on but eventually i managed to turn it on. However, the wifi started displaying stating that it had no hardware installed. I tried the shift+ctrl+option+power button restart and it started working again. However, after 20/30 mins it stopped working and it continuesly said wifi off and it would not let me turn it on. I spoke to an apple worker and they said it is a hardware problem, they did a diagnostic on it. Everything else works perfectly, i just wanted to know if this could be due to the water spillage (so i can prepare myself for a big bill) or is it just a general hardware problem (also have looked into the settings and it says Thunderbolt 1 inactive). If anyone could help i would appreciate it so much. Thanks \n\nA: In a word, yes.\nIf I may 'esplain. While it is possible that a board level repair shop might be able to resurrect the system to full functioning. Cleaning, drying and the like.\nYou didn't specify the model year of your MBAir but in this case I am not sure it matters as MBAirs are famous for being small and light and generally not upgradable. I believe (not sure but pretty sure) that the WiFi radio is likely integrated into the system board and not replaceable. Or not easily replaceable unless you find someone to do board level repair and have them replace the damaged components.\nIf a new Mac is not currently affordable you might find a USB WiFI adapter that is Mac compatible and that would give you WiFi at the expense of having a USB stick sticking out of your MBAir all the time.\n\nA: The problems are almost certainly related to the water spill, and not just some other concurrent problems. \nEven a light spill can cause 'fatal' damage, and even if the Mac works initially, it may fail in some way a short time after.\nYou may want to check if you have insurance that covers this. Household contents policies can cover accidental damage. Some credit cards also offer insurance on recent purchases.\n\nA: I feel for you!

However, I have installed 32 bit Vista and Windows 7, 64 bit Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 on a 2007 iMac.

Instructions for installing this software are given as a answer to Using Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033 to install 64 bit Windows 7 or 8.\nYou should install Windows to BIOS boot. The main reason for this is that many of the drivers included in the Boot Camp Support Software are designed only for BIOS booting. \nAccording to Apple, the Windows 7 installation media is suppose to include Service Pack 1 (SP1). Although, users have posted success installing without SP1. The Microsoft website Installing Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp does not mention needing SP1.\nI could not boot from the Windows 7 DVD because the DVD contained multiple ways to boot. If you have this problem, then see my answer to to “Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install\nUSB flash drive based Windows installers would not work with my 2007 iMac.

Using notes is handy as you can have it in multiple devices and makes transition almost effortless. I'm willing to move some of these to Markdown so I can share the content and add formatting to it. \nIs it possible to be done by default? The only export option is to PDF. If there is some hack that I can apply I'm happy to spend some cycles on that but maybe there is already an option I'm missing.\nI've find a few questions pointing to apps to directly do this (Editor or notes application with Markdown support?), but I'm trying to find an alternative with the native app.\n\nA: Unfortunately the native app does not offer this. \nThere is an app available for macOS in the App Store called Exporter that offers this. I am not affiliated with the software.\nAnother option is exporting to PDF in Notes, (File > Export as PDF…), then exporting to Markdown using a website like this one: PDF To Markdown Converter\n\nA: If you're moving to Bear, there's an option here which uses Keyboard Maestro to automate the process: https://github.com/KrauseFx/notes-exporter\nI'm sure it could be adapted for another destination application relatively easily\n\nA: Update 2: There is a free app in the MAS \"Exporter\" which supports bulk exporting to Markdown.\n\nUpdate 1: This is no longer working for me as of macOS Monterey 12.4.\nIt may still work on earlier versions of macOS. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nAn equivalent to “exporting” as Markdown is possible through the pasteboard from Notes.app (at least on macOS) to some markdown enabled editors.\nYou need to just copy the text of the note and then Paste and Match Style (not regular Paste!) into your IDE / markdown editor / etc which will paste it as Markdown.\nCaveats:\n\n*\n\n*iOS Notes.app support is limited.  Update: The feature is there on copy, but not easily accessible — pasting normally into Drafts.app renders as Markdown formatting, but I haven't found any other apps where this works.\n\n*No built-in bulk export to Markdown option.\n\n*This feature doesn't seem to exist in the web app version of Notes.\n\n\nA: I have tried a couple of ways mentioned here and around the web. Although there is no in-app solution to export Notes in a format other than PDF files, I have stumbled upon the following two solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Export in Markdown (or in other formats in the paid version) via the Bear app. I found this way easier and of more quality in terms of keeping the formatting, attachments, etc:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Bear migration Workflow script from here and follow the instructions.\n\n*[optional] At this point, you have the HTML files with inline encoded images. Use my script to decode images to get regular HTML files with the images in an accompanying directory.\n\n*Install Bear and import the exported files from Notes.\n\n*Export the files as Markdown, HTML, or whatever format you desire from File -> Export Notes within the Bear app. Don't forget to check the \"Export attachments\" box in the export dialog.\n\n\n\n*Export in HTML (and then convert to Markdown if you want) via the Notes Exporter app. The app gives you HTML files with inline encoded Base64 images saved with .txt extension (?!). Although I personally like this way as it generates output files that mimic closely the original Notes, the hyperlinks are missing in the exported files (it still keeps the hyperlink coloring though):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Notes Exporter from here.\n\n*Export Notes to the path you choose.\n\n*[optional] Rename file extensions to .html.\n\n*Voilà, now you have your Notes as HTML files with the same formatting and images.\n\n*Decode inline Base64 images and save HTML files with images saved in a separate adjacent directory using the script that I wrote for this:\nhttps://gist.github.com/SHi-ON/945ea2272ea4bb29e13bd0305370da90\nHope this helps folks out there!\n", "Q: Airdrop or export multiple original quality videos from iOS Photos app My Photos library has a few large videos in it encoded in HEVC. I am trying to export specific videos out of it in original quality, but I can't find a way to do this effectively. \n\n\n*\n\n*Airdropping seems to convert the videos first no matter what. I couldn't find any settings to make Airdrop transfer original-quality videos, either to another macOS or iOS device, even if they are above macOS High Sierra/iOS 11 (the requirement for HEVC playback).\n\n*Using iOS's share sheet will also \"Prepare\" (or convert) the videos you're trying to share before allowing another app to open them.\n\n*I used to put these videos into an album, open the Readdle Documents app, and then move all the videos from the album (which you can view directly from the Documents app) into a folder. I could then transfer this to my computer at my convenience. However, it seems like now when Documents requests the videos from iOS, iOS automatically converts the videos before allowing Documents to access (move) them into its own file system, thereby doubling the file size.\n\n*I tried using Image Capture on macOS to import the videos to my Mac, which allows for the importing of originals. However, it's not possible to grab videos from an album this way. It's quite hard to find each video individually from the list to export. \nDoes anyone know of some smart way to export multiple original-quality videos from the Photos app?\n\nA: I can transfer HEVC videos perfectly fine via AirDrop (iOS 12 → macOS Mojave).\nPlease check the transfer settings in the iOS Settings app > Photos (last element). Setting should be \"Keep Originals\".\n\n", "Q: Will Time Machine recognize my account if I change the user name? macos allows you to change your user account name (the name of the home folder) (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548). My question is, will this affect the Time Machine backups of this account? I don't want Time Machine to think it's a new user and start backing up from scratch. \nFor example, suppose the current account name is \"Fred\" and TM backups exist for Fred. If I then rename Fred to \"Barney\", will TM recognize that Barney used to be Fred, and continue making incremental backups? Or will TM think Barney is an entirely new user, and create a full back up?\n\nA: No, it wont see the files as the same files. \nTime Machine has no deduplication or moved file capabilities, so if you were to make a new user folder (which is what the short name is), your new user folder would double up the space on the backup destination. \n\nNow, all is not lost, since you can use a tool like Daisy Disk or just Finder to calculate all sizes. Once you know your backup drive has room for the extra new files, just make the change you want. Over time, the older backups thin and you can also go in after a month or three or however long you want to delete all backups of the old user folder.\nIf you know you don’t need your backup files, you could even delete them before you change things, but you are on a trapeze without a net until the first backup completes. And you lose backup history of changed and deleted files. \nBetter to just double up and wait. At some point, those old backups are not needed. Or - just consider when the drive fills - duplicate files or not - just put that old drive on a shelf or in storage and buy a new drive. Start with the new backups. The time you will lose trying to micromanage backups isn't worth the cost of a TB drive for many people so even though you are well armed knowing that changing path to a file makes a new backup, it's not a large problem in practice for all but the most cost conscious people.\nBuy advice is go be Barney and let Fred sit until you're sure you don't need that past data and then erase that when you need to and not when you make the initial change.\n", "Q: Macos Mojave: how to deal with corrupted bsd_flag in a private/var directory? Machine: MacBook Pro late 2013\nOS: Mojave 10.14.1\nDisk Utility reported several problems with my HDD, so I ran it in recovery mode, and when more problems were left, I ran fsck in single user mode.\nThe only problem that persisted was this:\n\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0x202797435): invalid bsd_flags\n  (0x184)\n\nFrom my research, this has to do with permissions. So I converted 202797435 to decimal and ran this terminal command to locate the file:\nsudo find / -inum 8631448629\n\nWhich pointed me to this file:\n/private/var/folders/8y/3pg_4v8n6m3bf4d11ln3z32c0000gn/T/fr.madrau.switchresx.app-559924946001.conf\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed though, I don't know if it's safe to simply delete. It would appear so as fr.madrau.switchresx.app implies this is a config file for the app SwitchResX, but trying to move this file to Desktop was met with a permission denied error (I'm not sure this is part of MacOS protections, or the actual permission problem). \nSo...what's the best way to proceed from here?\n\nA: After further research I found out it's safe to delete some files in private/var/folders (please do your own research), so I cded to the folder and deleted the file via Terminal:\nsudo rm fr.madrau.switchresx.app-559924946001.conf\n\nDisk utility reports are clean.

According to memtest86, there is a persistent single bit error in my MacBook Pro's 16GB of DDR RAM. \nSince the error is in the second half of the physical address space, I can work around the problem by running sudo nvram boot-args=\"maxmem=8192\". However, this is a bit of a waste of the other half - a working 8GB minus one bit.\nIs there a way, perhaps with an Open Firmware command or configuration, or a special boot-args option (e.g. nvphash?), that will allow me to mark as unusable just the small section that contains the bit error?\n\nA: You can achieve what you want with the system call mmap(2) passing as argument for the protection value PROT_NONE which means pages can't be accessed.\nBut I would suggest to buy a new memory chip, because the error you detected is the signature of bad quality and your erroneous bit won't stay alone for too long (within the same chip).\n", "Q: Can I update to python3.7 from python2.7 in my macOS 10.14.1? I have macOS 10.14.1. I installed Python3.7 but can see that python2.7 already installed in my os. Can I remove 2.7 and just keep 3.7? Will it affect other apps?\n\nA: You don't need to remove one in order to install the other. You can have both python 2.7 and python 3 on your Mac. (In fact, python 2.7 is part of the OS and can't really be removed).\nYou just need to make sure that you invoke the correct one, either by typing python3 on the command line, or using #!/usr/bin/env python3 in scripts. \n\nA: You should not remove python 2.7 but you can install python 3.7. I suggest you use  Anaconda and install python 3.7. After installing 3.7 be sure to create and use virtual environments. There are instructions on the internet on how to use virtual environments.\n\nA: In the past I would have told never ever to uninstall anything installed as part of MacOS, as this is just calling for troubles. But this is a moot point now because you can't remove anything from /usr/bin anymore. Not in 10.14, not in 10.13 either. Even with sudo you can't. For example:\n/usr/bin% sudo mv zprint zprint-bis                                     \nmv: rename zprint to zprint-bis: Operation not permitted\n\nThe way to go is what you did, I guess. Install python3 in /usr/local which is all yours for the taking. Then modify your PATH so that /usr/local appears before /usr/bin. The standard way to do that on MacOS is to modify /etc/paths. Here is what mine looks like:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nNo need to modify your ~/.profile or any other shell startup script. Note that it will only get you the right PATH when running from Terminal.

This is by design and can't be changed\nIf you're in Power Reserve mode, that means you don't want to display anything that could possibly increase the power usage.  The date is one of those fields.\n\nA: Unfortunately it is not possible to show the current date in Power Reserve Mode - only the current time.\n\nA: In Power Reserve mode the goal is to save battery as you are on low power.\nThis shuts down all functionally except the time which is displayed by pressing the button.

I always did this in the past with my older iPhones and a 3rd Gen Apple TV: launch a facetime session, enable AirPlay mirroring to the TV and turn the phone sideways to get landscape mode so that the image would take up the entire TV screen.\nMy wife now has an iPhone XS and has been trying to do a landscape FaceTime with me while I'm away and it never fills the 46\" HDTV. Yes, it rotates when she flips the phone, but it only rotates within the narrow vertical space, i.e. as if someone was to take a vertical video and display it on a widescreen TV.. massive unused space on left and right of image.\nI've made sure that the \"lock rotate\" button is not enabled, but I can't find any reason why it isn't rotating into a landscape view and taking up the whole TV screen.\nAny thoughts? Did Apple remove this feature for some reason?\nEDIT: I found this link which someone seems to suggest it still works, but I can't find elsewhere on the internet anyone claiming it works.\n\nA: my wife's iphone xs is in the mail, so this is speculative, but i would guess the new resolution is causing an under/overscan issue to manifest. Try adjusting on the apple tv and see if it works.\nOn Apple TV 4K or Apple TV (4th generation), go to Settings > AirPlay > AirPlay Display Underscan.\nOn Apple TV (2nd or 3rd Generation), go to Settings > Audio & Video > Adjust for AirPlay Overscan. \n\nA: It does not work. Personal experience with a iPhone 7 Plus confirms this. In addition, this Apple forum thread reporting the issue dates back to 2014: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6650493\nIt appears to be consistently working with iPads, according to reports, but not iPhones since then. \nPerhaps Apple thinks that phone users don't need to use landscape? \n", "Q: Modifying `whatis` to return error code for missing commands Followup to \"whatis\" returns 0 for missing commands, I am trying to modify /usr/bin/whatis to return a non-zero exit code after an inappropriate command has been entered.

Even though messages was disabled under \"Apps Using iCloud\" this was still happening and my backup size was ~4.8GB. The fix for me was to actually enable \"Messages\" under \"Apps Using iCloud\", then promptly disable it again. Next I had to go into \"Manage Storage\" select \"Messages\" and then click \"Delete & Disable.\" This tricked iCloud into recognizing the actual size of my backup which is now down around 180MB!\nSeems like this is a bug in the iCloud management code. Anyway, hope this helps someone else.\n\nA: To figure out what exactly gets backed up (or what iOS wants to backup):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap on your AppleID settings at the top\n\n*Tap on \"iCloud\"\n\n*Tap on \"Manage Storage\" (the option directly beneath the colored bar showing storage use) \n\n*Tap on \"Backups\"\n\n*Select your device\n\n\nThis gives you a list of all things iOS wants to backup, including their size. It also gives you the option to enable/disable which application data gets backed up.\n\nA: As seen from the photos, your large backup was 5.22 GB which is a significant amount. I see you have disabled some options, so the backup sie is now 188.4 MB.\nNow you have two options:\nBuy more storage\nIf you want to keep your old backup you need to buy more storage to backup again. To buy more storage click the Upgrade button.\nDelete old backups\nTo free up space you can delete your old large backups. On the iCloud storage screen, go to Manage Storage and then Backups. Here you can delete Backups for a specific device.\nTo fix the large backup issue:\n\nDelete all backups, log out of iCloud, log back in and do a fresh backup. That always works.\n\n(Source)\n\nA: You can purchase more storage for just one month and back up your phone to be sure it works ok. If your iphone backup runs to completion then you can check the actual size of the backup. If it is indeed too large to copy to you lower icloud storage, you can try making room or keep your extra storage. If you can fix your problem then be sure to lower your storage option.  This way will cost you 99 cents I believe.  \n\nA: I created an account just to answer this question.  I ran into this issue myself months ago and was unable to find an answer.  The short of it is, Apple is backing up things even if you have them disabled.  In my case, Messages was completely disabled from iCloud backup.  In fact, almost everything was but my initial backups kept saying 4.4GB or so.  I looked at my storage and noticed the closest to that were my Messages.  So as a test I deleted a top conversation that was over 1GB and when I recalculated my iCloud backups, sure enough it dropped by a gig.  \nSo great job to Apple backing up something I explicitly disabled.  Thankfully I resolved this issue on my own doing testing.  I hope this helps others.\n\nA: I had this similar problem and finally resolved it by:\n\n*\n\n*Going into the Settings ->  -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Backups ->   and turned off Messages from the backup.\n\nAt this point, my iCloud storage did not get any smaller, but it now showed a huge bar for Messages (in green) and a small bar for Backups (in blue).  Overall, my iCloud usage was unchanged.\n\n\n*Went to Settings ->  -> iCloud -> Messages and clicked on 'Disable and Delete' which merely downloads the entirety of your messages to your phone.\n\n\n*Go through the messages and eliminate photos, etc.  Typically, I deleted the cruft photos and saved the others, then used google photos app to upload them and deleted them locally.\n\n\n*Went to Settings ->  -> iCloud -> Messages and turned that back on.\nAt this point, I have the same size Backups (in blue) bar and a much smaller Messages (in green) bar.\nThe first time I ran into this problem, I was at 4.8 GiB and the process brought me down below 1 GiB.  I have since made it a habit to bring up the top messages about once per week and remove photos that no longer serve their purpose.  I watch as my iCloud storage fills, and when it is getting close to 4 GiB, I merely do steps 2 and 4 above and it shrinks down in a matter of moments.\nNOTE: once I added an iPad to my account, I need to do step 2 on both devices, then do step 4 on both devices.\n\nA: I had the same problem. In my case my photo library was the one that was taking up space. In apps that are using iCloud I turned off the Photos app but that wasn't enough.\nHere is what I did to solve it. The way I went about it, you need an iOS device, it might also work on an iPad but I haven't tried it.\nOn your iPhone phone :) go to \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > \n\n*Apple ID > \n\n*iCloud > \n\n*Manage Storage > \n\n*Backups > \n\n*(then select the device you are on, this device) \n\n*Under \"Choose data to back up, turn off the thing that is taking up space. In my case it was Photo Library. I didn't need to backup my photos on to iCloud because I use other services for that. This immediately shrunk the used space in my storage.\n\n\nA: Your backup is too large, because Apple includes your iMessages.\nI realize, there's a toggle switch for disabling Message backup, but that has never worked; I wish they'd fix that.\nIts all part of the design; most people end up saddling themselves with a monthly subscription upgrade to iCloud storage; nice job Apple.\nIt's highly annoying, going through phone, deleting, disabling everything from backups, only to find, nothing changed; Obviously by design since it's been like this since Sept 2016.\n\nA: SAVE BACKUP SOMEWHERE ELSE:\nBesides most these solid suggestions (turning off data you don't want to back up etc) another thing you can do to free up iCloud space is to save your backup somewhere else instead. You can choose to backup to your Mac computer instead. I did this and then I also copied it (you have to COPY, don't just move it) to my Google Drive in case something happens to my Mac.(Google Drive is cheaper than iCloud and something I already had before going full Mac)\nJust connect your device to your Mac with a usb cable, then in the Finder you can change the setting and set it to \"back up to this Mac\" manually. After you have backed it up, just delete the other backup from your device (in the device iCloud-backup-settings delete and disable backup)\nJust remember to backup every now and then depending on often your data changes.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was mind boggling. Most advice I found on internet dealt with culling apps to make your backup smaller. What do you do when you're already pared down to nearly nothing?\nIn my case, my \"next backup size\" was estimated at 6GB while having just a handful of apps enabled for backup, each measured in low KBs.\nI went to Settings > General > Phone Storage and reviewed what actually is stored on the phone. Aside from the usual big storage using apps (Messaging, Photos) there was 5GB of documents stored under a category \"On my phone\". I deleted those and voila the next backup size went down to something like 100 MB. I did not check prior to deleting, but I would now wager those were downloads of some kind.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue. iCloud was backing up data for apps that were clearly disabled. My iPhone iCloud backup size suddenly shot from 760 MBs to  4.8 GBs. The main issue was with Whatsapp, which was turned off, but iCloud was still including 4.6 GBs of its data. Whether I turned Whatsapp off or on, the total next backup size stayed the same (which should go up by 4.6 GBs after turning it on).\nTo further test, I deleted some photos and videos from Whatsapp chats. I found out that the total next backup size went down by the exact amount. This was surprising because I chose not to backup Whatsapp data.\nI contacted Apple support and was referred to the senior staff. Senior staff got back saying they cannot investigate issues with third-party apps and maybe it was Whatsapp metadata that was being included. When asked how much that is, they mentioned they cannot share any analytics about the device, and they also said I do not have the option to clear metadata / cache for third-party apps. Now there is 4.6 GBs of iCloud backup data that is technically unaccounted for (since the application data is disabled) and Apple has no reply.\nTo finally resolve, I will have to delete all my chats. The total size has exceeded 5 GBs and I will have to erase some precious messages because iCloud is backing up data for disabled apps and says there is no solution other than buying additional storage.\nYou should try deleting voice memos, messages with media and other similar content. Highly likely your issue will be resolved.\n\n\n\nA: I stumbled upon this thread while my iPhone 13 backup was crazy 460 GB big. It was even larger than I have storage available and it was really confusing because it said the storage only takes 64 GB.\nI found the problem. My fotos in reality only take about 31 GB, but due to a transfer of an old phone to this phone, it magically created duplicates worth 8000 pictures = 260 GB wtf Apple \nInitially I found this helpful info https://www.ubackup.com/phone-backup/why-is-my-photo-storage-so-high.html and it said in section Tip 1. Clear Recently Deleted album that Apple stores deleted albums like so\nGo to Photos app > Tap Albums at the bottom > Choose Recently Deleted > Tap the Select button at the top > Choose Delete All to remove all photos or you may choose to delete selected photos.\nWith this I noticed another section Duplicates 8000 and clicked on it. Then I joined all duplicates and additionally you need to go to iPhone Storage -> Photos -> Delete deleted Photos and boooom you get rid of 260 Gig.\nI really hope this helps you save some time and free up A LOT of space.\n\nA: It sounds like the problem is the messages on iCloud.  If so, maybe setting messages to automatically delete after one year would help.  And/or on the iPhone, Settings→General→iPhone Storage and look for large things you can delete.\nEspecially \"Review Large attachments.\"  If an attachment isn't already duplicated in Photos, you can go to Messages (or maybe Mail) and save it from there, assuming it's something you actually need to keep.\nMy wife and I get LOTS of images in messages, yet we don't run out of iCloud space, even though we sync lots of things (including photos) from five devices, all on the same Apple ID.

I had 56GB of space used up out of 128GB at one point on my 2017 MacBook Pro, so I know your pain. \n1) Back up to time machine. \n2) Reformat your hard drive to the old Mac files system (not AFPS, that won’t work)\n3) Check your HD - does it still have the 98GB? It shouldn’t.\n4) Reformat to AFPS (yep)\n5) Run Time Machine \nThis wiped the whole ‘container’ issue for me, although now there is still a manageable 4GB, which I assume is just time machine snapshots. I consider this fixed. \nHope that helps. If it does, spread the word and get Mac to fix this issue. \n", "Q: Changed Google Password and can't get into gmail on macmail anymore I changed my google password. I can no longer get into gmail on my mac anymore. I can get into gmail on my pc and on my mac going to gmail.com. They system preferences pops up with attached message (picture below). However when I click on \"Next\", the blue bar at the top just keeps scrolling. Nothing happens. Notice that this image is greyed out. Unclickable after I click on \"Next\". So there is no opportunity to even input my updated password. I have done it manually in the email preferences as well. \n\nA: Try to re-enable the Gmail account from Apple menu > System Preferences > Internet Accounts. If this does not work, boot to safe mode and attempt to disable and re-enable from here.

I just can't seem to master the new Diskutil when it comes to resizing partitions non-standard ways.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can not do what you have proposed by using the tools provided by macOS. Partitions can grow and shrink, but the start of the partition must remain fixed. There are exceptions to this, but none apply in this case. There are third party tools that can move a partition. For example, Paragon offers a Hard Disk Manager for Mac application which makes the following claim. \n\nEnables to move the left or right border of the selected partition, thus not only resizing but moving it on the disk \n\nThe time required to move all but the smallest partitions is usually quite lengthly. I suppose this might be one reason Apple does not provide this type of tool. An exception would be when resizing a Apple HFS partition. The Disk Utility application and the diskutil command will move any Apple_Boot partition that is the next partition stored on the drive. Usually, this partition and is small in size (under 1 GB) and therefore can be moved fairly quickly. With the introduction of APFS, Apple eliminated the need for partitions of this type.  \n", "Q: iPhone and iCloud storage not fill but isn't allowing me to take a picture i have an ihphone X with 64GB of storage and 200GB of icloud storage. as you can see bellow both of them have still available space. \n\nUnfortunatelytely the \"iPhone storage full, can't take a picture\" notification still pops up. i tried workig something out via mac but nothing changed, also my iCloud storage says it's at 1% deespite the fact it has 114GB left... Can someone help? \n\nA: That is iCloud online storage and not the actual device storage. \nSee My storage was not updated\nYou need the storage on the device to take a photo. Check it in Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage.\n\nThe iPhone itself has a fixed hardware memory, or space, which can only be chosen when you buy it, in 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 GB configurations.\n  The total you see in Settings > General > Storage will never be quite this figure, as some of that is needed for the formatting of the memory & the data structure itself.\n  This memory is where it stores all apps, music, documents etc that your phone can use.\n\n\n", "Q: Are favorites in the Photos app suppose to sync between devices? I use Apple Photos on my Macs and on my iOS devices. I can flag photos via the Heart icon as favorites, but in my case they are not synced between devices.\nIs this a bug, or is this meant to be like this?\nps: I saw the question Are \"Favorites\" and edits synced with Photos for Mac/iOS?, but it neither attracted answers nor is it it particular current - that's why I ask this here and now.\n\nA: They will (or should) sync between devices if you are using iCloud Photo Library, otherwise, e.g. when syncing just the PhotoStream, favourites do not sync.\nI just tested this on a device running iOS 12.1.3 and macOS Mojave 10.14.3 by favoriting a photo in the iOS photos app, and not only did the photo appear in the Favorites album in Photos.app on Mac, the Favorites album was automatically created in both places. (I don't use Favorites, but they do seem to work for me.)\nAccording to Apple's Support article for iCloud Photo Library, edits do indeed sync between devices. I also confirmed this just now by cropping a photo on my Mac, and watching the cropped photo appear on my iOS device.\nNB: if you are trying to sync favorites between devices using a hardline sync such as iTunes, I am unable to describe what the correct behavior for that is, as I don't have a setup to test it with currently, nor could I find any information on Apple's support website.\n\nA: According to this Support article from 2016 the answer depends on how you sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you import photos from an iOS device to Photos over USB, the favorite status will not sync (!) but edits should (at least they do now, but not back then, I've tested this)\n\n*If you use iCloud Photo Library to sync across devices the favorite status will sync along with the edits.\n\n\nSource: Apple Support - Q: iOS Photos to OSX Photos favorites sync\nFWIW this is totally offensive and horrible, I can hardly believe it. I just did an import of 3k images and apparently have lost all of my favorite statuses. What a mess. \n", "Q: What is the difference between OneDrive from AppStore and standalone installer Right now there two options for installing OneDrive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install from the AppStore\n\n*Download and install a standalone installer\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the two if any? (but then why there are two options to install it?)\nI could not find any explanation on Microsoft website. \n\nA: The difference between the two is that the App Store version is \"sandboxed\" where as the standalone version is not. \n\"Sandboxing\" means that the application is limited in what kind of resources on your computer it can access. This is the reason that when using the App Store version for the first time, you have to confirm the location of your OneDrive on your computer. This makes that folder available through the sandbox for OneDrive.\nSandboxing means that some features won't work on the App Store version - i.e. they're not available. However, Microsoft really isn't documenting or emphasising anywhere what those features might be. \"Ordinary\" home user usage of OneDrive is fully supported, but if you want to use other features, you might have to check that they work in the App Store version. For example take a look at this Microsoft guide:\nhttps://support.office.com/da-dk/article/synkroniser-filer-med-onedrive-synkroniseringsklienten-på-mac-os-x-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f\nIt explains how you can set up OneDrive to synchronize files with an enterprise Sharepoint installation. As the first step it tells you to uninstall the App Store version of OneDrive, and install the standalone version.\nIn short: If you want all features, use the standalone installer. If you want an easy, familiar installation process - use the App Store version.\nOnly Microsoft can say why they decided to have two different installation options. In general however, the most common reasons for doing that is supporting enterprise automated installations, and for supplying \"familiar\" and \"easy to use\" installation for home users.\n", "Q: How can I hide the path bar in the Mac Terminal There's a bar under the title bar of the Mac terminal showing the path the terminal is open at. I'm pretty sure this has recently appeared and I'd like to removed it. Is there a way?\n\n\nA: This is the tab bar (note the plus icon on the right to open a new tab).\nAs long as you only have one tab open in a Terminal window, you should be able to hide it by selecting \"Hide Tab Bar\" from the \"View\" menu.\n", "Q: Change iOS account on iPhone without losing data For my company I had to create an Apple ID to publish our app. I am the one with an iPhone for personal use and I have an Apple ID for private use. I do not want this Apple ID to be affiliated with my companies. \nFor the enrollment process of an App Store account I need to enable the 2 factor auth and this can only be done by logging in to a iOS or Mac OS device and enable the 2auth there. Every time I would login into my account from an unkown device I have to get the code from this phone with this companies account. \nAlso when I will log-out of my private account all data will be lost. That is what a warning message says.\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot have my private and business Apple ID on one phone\n\n*I do not want to only have the business Apple ID on the phone because it is my phone not the companies\n\n*My company does not have the resources to buy another Apple device\n\n*The device we will use needs to stay in our hands\n\n\nAbove statements are the fact but not really my situation. What would one do to fix above scenario?\n\nA: You cannot add the business account for 2FA to your iPhone without first logging off the private account. However, when you have logged into the business account and enabled 2FA, you can logout and then login to your private account again.\nInstead of purchasing a new phone for the business, you can also use any other modern iOS or macOS device for enabling 2FA. I.e. you can use for example a Mac computer or an iPad or iPod Touch.\n", "Q: Your calendar couldn't be refreshed (Operation: CalDAVRefreshDelegateListQueueableOperation) After upgrading to the latest Mojave update [10.14.3[, I got this error prompt when attempting to sync my calendar.\n\nTemporarily, I'm using Fantastical as my Calendar, But really prefer the Calendar.app over Fantastical.\nAnyone got it too? How should I fix this?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: *\n\n*Under Preferences > Accounts I unchecked Enable this account for each of my accounts\n\n*I then closed the Calendar application completely (cmd+q)\n\n*After re-opening Calendar, I rechecked Enable this account for each account\n\nand everything seems to work now!\n\nA: Sign out of iCloud\nTo fix this sign out of iCloud in the preferences pane. No data will be lost and all will be retrieved when you sign back in again. If you use iCloud Keychain, when you sign back in to iCloud follow one of the procedures described in this Support article to set it up on an additional device.\nIf that doesn't work\nIf signing out and in of iCloud doesn't work there are several other options you could try. \nRe-enabling the calender account\nYou could try re-enabling the affected calender account. From the Calendar menu bar, select\nCalendar ▹ Preferences ▹ Accounts.\nChoose the affected account from the list on the left and uncheck the box marked. Then check it again to enable the account.\nAdd the account again with the same settings\nYou can make a note of the settings for that acxoint, then delete it and add it again with the same settings.\nCheck your settings\nIf you can't add the account, the settings may be invalid. Verify them. How you do that depends on what kind of account it is. If it's a Google calendar and you've activated 2-step verification, you need to generate an application-specific password in your Google account and enter it in place of your old password.\n", "Q: Why repeat a try statement in AppleScript before returning an error? I’m trying to learn AppleScript and have seen the following example for the Photos app:\ntry\n    set thisId to id of item 1 of sel\non error errText number errNum\n    display dialog \"Error: cannot get the image ID\" & errNum & return & errText & \"Trying again\"\n\n    try\n        delay 2\n        set thisId to id of item 1 of sel\n    on error errTexttwo number errNumtwo\n        display dialog \"Skipping image due to repeated error: \" & errNumtwo & return & errTexttwo\n        error \"giving up\"\n        return\n    end try --second attempt\nend try\n\nWhy is there a second try statement doing the same thing after a short delay before giving up? The same is done in several places in this example script. \nIs this a normal way of handling errors in AppleScript or is this specific for Photos and if so why?\n\nA: Applescript is seems to suffer with timing issues that usually are solved be using a delay. Often this delay needs to be tuned to match the speed of a particular model Mac. In other words, the delay hard coded in the the AppleScript may work on a newer faster Mac, but need to be increased when run on a slower Mac.\n", "Q: Issues erasing APFS disk The MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) won't boot because it can't find the system software (flashing questionmark folder when trying to boot). \nI tried to reinstall the system by installing macOS on an external HDD, booting the MacBook Pro from the HDD and trying to erase the internal HDD (APFS) which won't work because of the following error:\n\nPOSIX reports: The operation couldn't be completed.

This is a huge problem for me, as I have a 16GB phone!\nI have backed up and wiped my phone in every possible combination multiple times over the last year or so and nothing helps.  Plugging it into iTunes and letting it sit open for a few minutes will clear less than 500 MB, and eventually that gets racked back up again.\nAny ideas on how to fix this, or is my phone just screwed?\n\nA: This is completely normal. \nYou can try clear unused files by restoring your iPhone from a backup.\nYou can also store your other files on iCloud to not take up space on the device. Some cases also offer additional storage. See here on how to clear up storage space. \nAdditionally, see iPhone System taking up Storage space.\n", "Q: Time Machine backup silently fails.

I have an application installed in the ~/Applications folder. I've been using it for years with no problems. But after a recent update this application started giving me warnings that it should be installed in the main /Applications folder. But still it is working just fine, and I see no reasons to move it out from where it is now (aside from this annoying warning).\nSo I asked the application's support team, why do they want me to have their application installed exactly in /Applications, and here's the answer they gave me:\n\nIn order to be fully sandboxed the application must be installed into the /Applications folder\n\nIs it really so? Mac OS sandboxes only applications installed in the /Applications? Is it stated somewhere in Apple's documentation? I could only find this article (the section about launching helpers).\nAnd additional question: does it mean that ~/Applications (or any other) folder is \"less secure\" then for installing applications?\n[Update]\nI've got another answer from support: now they're saying that it's sandboxing and access to code signature verification API what requires them to have their application installed exactly at /Applications. I've posted a Stack Overflow question about that.\n\nA: No, it is not really so. Being or not being stored in /Applications is not the determining factor in deciding whether or not an app is sandboxed.\nNo, other folders are not \"less secure\" than /Applications.\nYou haven't described which application in particular you're dealing with, but I would guess that you're running into a specific limitation on sandboxed applications - namely helpers:\nAn application can include a helper that is run in background using LaunchService - i.e. it runs even though you haven't started the main application. \nHowever, a sandboxed application can only automatically start a helper if the application is stored in /Applications!\nNote that there are other requirements that must be fulfilled also, but this is the one with relevance to sandboxing and the /Applications folder. The other requirements are for example that the helper must be signed (similar to the main application) and that the user must have manually started the helper before it can be automatically started.\nYou can read about macOS sandboxing in more detail here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AppSandboxInDepth/AppSandboxInDepth.html\n", "Q: Airplaying: consumption of mobile data? If I create a Personal Hot Spot Wi-Fi (on an iPhone 8 with iOS 12.1.3), connect an Apple TV 4k to that Wi-Fi, will I incure mobile data usage if I airplay to the Apple TV using previously downloaded iTunes movies on the iPhone?\n\nA: As you are not on a WiFi network, data will be used to transmit the signal. \n\nIf you have no wifi to connect to, then you will using cellular data which will eat up your data. don't want it to eat data, then get a wifi connection.\n\n(Source)\nAs you have the move downloaded the data consumption will be reduced but data will still be used.\n", "Q: How to use automator services in Fluid-created apps in Mojave I was having an issue with Spotlight and an Apple support person had me \"upgrade\" to Mojave and now I'm pissed off.  None of my Automator services work in my Fluid Apps anymore!  I have about a half-dozen Fluid apps so I can either assign them to all desktops (and not affect other browser windows) or so I can have multiple sessions with some websites that only support 1 browser window open to their site (e.g. the galaxy web app).  I have over a dozen automator services that are extremely useful.  Most accept selected text \"from any application\" and do various things with that text (e.g. report stats on selected nucleotides).\nNow, when I try to run a service on selected text in a Fluid-created app, I get an error that states 'The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error: “Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events.”'.  If these services were apps, I could easily add them in system preferences to Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility, but they are workflows installed as services (located in ~/Library/Services/) and thus cannot be added.  I have added the Fluid-created apps, but that doesn't stop the error either.\nI spoke with Apple Support and they indicated that the Fluid-created app won't work with services because of code-signing.  The app has to be from an apple-recognized developer in order to be allowed access!\nI fully understand the security concern, but this is very frustrating.  Does anyone know how to allow services to work in Fluid-created apps?\n\nUPDATE: I have tried adding the app (e.g. \"Galaxy1.app\") to both the Accessibility and Full Disk Access sections of the security and privacy system preference page and I still get the error:\n\n\n\nA: I figured out a work-around for part of my problem.  I'm not going to select this (my own) answer because it doesn't solve the entire problem.  The main reason I use Fluid to wrap galaxy in an \"app\" is because you can only have 1 galaxy browser window open.  If I have 2 open, changes made in 1 window affect the other, so when I'm working on 2 different projects concurrently, I was using separate Fluid apps to keep the projects from stepping on one another's toes.  I knew that private browser windows could also accomplish this, but I liked the convenience of a dock icon.\nSo I just worked out an Applescript, saved as an app, that opens a new private Safari window to galaxy.princeton.edu.  I then added that app to Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility.  This script is slightly simplified from what I actually used:\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"n\" using {shift down, command down}\n    delay 0.5\n    keystroke \"http://galaxy\"\n    key code 47\n    keystroke \"princeton\"\n    key code 47\n    keystroke \"edu/\"\n    keystroke return\nend tell\n\nNote, depending on your accessibility preferences, Applescript will not type numbers, dots, or a few other characters, thus the key code 47 for the dots.\nNow, whenever I run this \"app\" (which I gave the galaxy icon), it will open a new Safari browser window to galaxy.\nThis allows me to run my automator services on DNA strings in galaxy because Safari can be given permission to send apple events to System Events.app, whereas Fluid apps can't (I believe because they're not code signed).\n\nA: You need to allow for Automator and any Fluid created apps in both the Accessibility and Full Disk Access menus of System Preferences/ Security & Privacy/ Privacy tabs. You may also need to add System Events.app to allow access also.  Then you should be good to go\n\n\n", "Q: Google Drive File Stream keeps enabling it's Finder extension I do not want any Finder extensions and turn I them off in System Preferences. After quitting and reopening Google Drive File Stream, its Finder extension always turns back on.\nWhat can I do to ensure it remains turned off?\n\n\nA: Google Drive Stream is defaulted to automatically start at login within the Google Drive Stream preferences.  \nThere are two places it can be set - system (host) wide, or user only.  The locations are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Wide: /Library/Preferences/com.google.drivefs.settings\n\n*User Only:  ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.drivefs.settings\nCheck to see settings by using the defaults command to get the AutoStartOnLogin setting.  For example, to see the setting system wide issue the command:\n$ sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.google.drivefs.settings AutoStartOnLogin\n\nDo this for both locations by changing the path to the .settings file as described above.\nIf either come back \"true\", you've found the cause.  Next, write a new value to turn it off.  System wide example:\n$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.google.drivefs.settings AutoStartOnLogin -bool false\n\n\nA: This is an issue with the Google Drive extension. There’s not much that can be done.\nYou can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting your Mac\n\n*Updating Google Drive \n\n*Seeing if the launch of a specific app named it enable \nIf that doesn’t work the best option would be to submit a Google bug report. \nYou can see Google contact methods here.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backups I am doing a clean install of Mojave on my MacBook - it has simply not been possible to upgrade from High Sierra to Mojave automatically.\nI understand that it will overwrite all of the HDD contents\nI know I can simply copy document files etc and then copy them back into the new system\nBut, will a Time Machine backup from the original High Sierra be able to reinstall all of my programs?\n\nA: Thanks for the help. The problem turned out to be both more complicated and simpler than I originally thought.\nI had installed a Tar Disk in 2015 and more research showed that quite a few users were having the same problems and error messages as I was.\nI followed the instructions here - https://www.tardisk.com/pages/uninstall-sierra - to uninstall the Tar Disk - NOT removing it because I was coming from High Sierra, as the instructions said. It DID NOT solve the problem.\nI then went through the whole rigamarole again; shut down my MacBook and physically removed the Tar Disk. I then reopened the Disk Utility and reformatted the internal Mac SSD - installed Mojave from a USB and it seems to have worked.\nTo answer my PRECISE question - now that Mojave is installed - Time Machine has been able to recover/reinstall all of my files and programs\nThanks again to those of you who responded\n\nA: Though your proposed solution may not actually get to the root of this issue, assuming you can successfully install a fresh Mojave OS onto your machine...\nYes, a Time Machine backup can be used to Migrate to a newer macOS. The only difficulty would be if you try to Migrate to an older one.\nPerform the Migration immediately at first signup/login to the new OS. If you do it later, you will end up with two accounts rather than one simple migration.\nTheoretically, you should end up with essentially the same as if you had just done the update the regular way, all apps, prefs, docs exactly as you had them.\n\nA: If your nervous about depending on Time Machine backups you should consider that Carbon Copy Cloner might be your best simple solution. \nIt will let you go into the weeds and grab the files that are relevant when transitioning OS versions and disk formats (HFS+ vs APFS).\nTime Machine is great for those weekly backups in case your disk suddenly dies, but CCC is the advanced route that gives you the flexibility and options you might need (I just did a Mojave back to High Sierra restore combined with APFS back to HFS+ with CCC).\nResources:\n\nhttps://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/everything-you-need-know-about-carbon-copy-cloner-and-apfs\nhttps://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-app-for-bootable-backups/\nhttps://www.maketecheasier.com/create-bootable-clone-of-mac/\nJust make sure that your not running into any problems because of going between a case-sensitive & case-insensitive disk format.. but https://github.com/cr/MacCaseSensitiveConversion will help with that :)\n", "Q: Internet recovery mode: Always restart after download complete Please help :(.

My iOS version is 12.1.2.  I don't recall approving an update recently.  There is apparently a version 12.1.3 available, but without connectivity, I can't install it.\n\nA: Apparently, DHCP is not enabled on your laptop, but it has the right configuration, so I figure either DHCP must have been disabled on your router recently, or your phone was configured with static addresses which got cleared recently.\nFor a quick fix, try filling in the Router, IP address, and subnet mask fields on your phone after choosing Manual for \"Configure IP\". Something like:\nConfigure IP: Manual  \nIP address: 192.168.1.123  \nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  \nRouter: 192.168.1.1  \n\nBut you probably want to fix the settings on your router so you don't have to configure every device that connects to your network in the future.\nLook for a setting that enables DHCP in your router's administrative interface, possibly on http://192.168.1.1\n\nA: Rebooting the router allowed the iPhone to connect via DHCP.  I can't guarantee that it works for all cases of this problem, but it's another quiver for your bow.\n", "Q: How to disable USB Mass Storage Device in macOS Mojave I have been searching a solution on how to disable the USB ports on Mac mini to prevent data copy to external USB mass storage devices.

I checked the login items on system preferences and nothing should be opening.\n\nA: Yes - this can be disconcerting when you don't realize that the majority of the Apple apps save their system state and don't even need to be told to start or stop. You can have an app in the dock when it's not running and you can have an app running when it's not in the dock. (or the task switcher interface)\nThe simple way to reset this is to choose log out from the Apple menu and turn off the check mark below.\n\nThen log out, log in and log out again and verify the status if the check is disabled and the apps do not relaunch. \nIn some rare cases, this setting / preference could get corrupt, so I then turn it on (which is the opposite of what you want)- log out / log in - then turn it off  (what you want) and before contacting support.

Derived Data folder.\nSource:\nHow to clear Xcode cache manually\n1. Clean the build\nTip: If you’re trying to fix a problem with Xcode crashing, it’s worth cleaning the project build first. This will get rid of the current build and create a new one next time you run the code.\n\n*\n\n*With the project open in code, go to the menu bar, choose Product -> Clean or:\n\n*With the project open, press Command + Shift + K.\n\n2. Clean out the build folder\nTo clean out the build folder, and get rid of cache files, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*In the Code project, click on the Product menu while holding down Option and choose Clean build folder, or:\n\n*Press Command + Shift + Option + K.\n\n3. Reset Simulator content and settings\nIf neither of the steps above resolves your problem, try resetting the simulator content and settings:\nGo to the menu and choose iOS Simulator, then click Reset Content and Settings.\n4. Delete derived data\nIf you’re still having problems, try deleting derived data, which will force Xcode to recreate it when you next run it.\n\n*\n\n*In the menu, choose Window -> Organizer.\n\n*Now select Projects -> Select your project.\n\n*Choose the project whose derived data you want to delete.\n\n*In the window that opens, you’ll see see the Derived Data folder listed, along with its Finder path.\n\n*To the right of the folder, there’s a Delete button. Press it.\n\nNow, delete the module cache.\n\n*\n\n*Go to: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ModuleCache.\n\n*Drag the files from the ModuleCache folder to the Trash and empty it.\n\n", "Q: Forgot administrator username and password MacBook Pro I got a MacBook Pro and I forgot my administrator username and password and I can't log in into my account.

My Mac shows the AirPods as connected but if I try to make a call, the sound still comes out of the internal speaker on my Mac. \nDoes anyone kn ow how I might fix this? Perhaps I need to adjust the internal microphone somehow? \nI've already set the AirPods as both the Input and Output for sound. \n\nA: If the headphones work with FaceTime and other audio apps then you can conclude the program you’re using for Vonage need some set up or you need to find a different program that respects the capabilities of macos to switch between multiple sound in and out options. \nYou have done all you can by using the sound preference pane to select a  choice and it’s up to the third-party software to respect your choices. \n", "Q: Open a picture with Photoshop or Preview based on file location Let's say I want to open pictures from those specific folders with Photoshop by default (with double-clicking the file):\n/Users/bob/Project1/\n/Users/bob/Project3/\n\nAnd to open pictures with Preview by default in any other location.\nI'm not aware of any solution out of the box. Maybe someone has an idea about it?\n\nA: You could build a partial solution with using Hazel and Automator.\n1st, create an Automator workflow that uses the \"Set Application for Files\" action on received files to Photoshop.\n2nd, create a Hazel rule that runs that Automator script on any images dropped into a specific folder. You could skip Hazel and just create a folder action in Automator but that would fire on any file placed in that folder and that might not be what you want.\nFiles modified in such a way would still open in Photoshop once removed from that folder, which is why this is only a partial solution.\n\nA: Based on Craig's answer, I found this very similar question that has a great solution using a bash script.\nIt works surprisingly well, at least for my needs.\nThe script is wrapped into an application, then the trick is to set up all the jpg files (for example) to be open with this application by default.\nThis setup is easily done with the \"Get Info\" --> \"Open with\" --> \"Change all\" steps.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n  if [ $(dirname \"$f\") = \"/Users/bob/Desktop\" ]\n  then\n    open -a \"/Applications/VLC.app\" \"$f\"\n  else\n    open -a \"/Applications/IINA.app\" \"$f\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n(As you can notice, this script switch between the two players VLC and INNA, but you can easily modify it to switch between Photoshop and Preview. The folders can also can be easily modified to /Users/bob/Project1/ and /Users/bob/Project3/ instead of /Users/bob/Desktop)\nAutomator is actually not needed, as it's possible to turn a bash script into an application from the Terminal.\nStill, if one prefer using Automator, it looks like this (from there you just run \"File --> export\" and save your application):\n\n", "Q: How do I kill pboard from command line? I'm sick of manually killing the pboard process in Activity Monitor to recover my copy & paste.  \nIs there a Terminal Command I can run instead?\n\nA: Try killall pboard. That should kill it.

Her's is broken, so I reset her HD, which I did it from Disk Utility.\nCan I reinstall macOS to hers from my Mac?\nI have an attachment that lets me access the files from the HD on my Mac via USB. Can this be done through Disk Utility?\n\nA: You don't mention which versions of the Macbook Pro and Macbook Air you have, but, with more recent (last 5 years or so), you can do an over-the-air restore.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown her Macbook Air.\n\n*Power up the Macbook Air and immediately press the following key combinations: Command + Option + R. Keep on holding the key combination until you see a spinning globe. You will be asked to connect to your WiFi network so please do so when prompted.\n\n*Once you boot into recovery, simply use the Disk Utility to wipe off your main HDD or SSD, go back to the main screen and click on Reinstall macOS on the drive you just wiped. It’s that simple.\nThis can be a slow process, as it's downloading the OS installer over wifi.\nThe official Apple support doc.\n", "Q: I removed another Mac's HD and reformatted it on disk utility, now it just shows blinking folder So I removed a 2015 Macbook Air's HD from the computer and then using an OWC tool, I plugged it into my Macbook Pro and then erased it completely using Disk Utility. When I plugged it back into the Macbook Air, it goes dark and shows a blinking folder with a question mark. How can I fix this? I can't find any info online with this... I have Mac OS Mojave \n\nA: Blinking folder with a question mark means it can't find the startup folder, because there's nothing on the disk. \nDisk should be formatted as APFS, with a scheme of GUID partition map. Reinstall it in the MacBook and boot while holding down option, command, and R at the same time. This will boot into internet recovery using a downloaded recovery image of the latest supported version of macOS your Mac can handle (10.14.3).\nWhen it finally boots into the recovery menu, you can select the option to install macOS and follow the prompts to install macOS.\n", "Q: MacOS: Get Notification System Update How do I get notification that there is an update for the MacOS system?

I have a number of folders in the following format:\nFolder_Name_1\n    Converted_Files\n        file1.aiff\n        file2.aiff\n             :\n             :\n        fileX.aiff\nFolder_Name_2\n    Converted_Files\n        file1.aiff\n        file2.aiff\n             :\n             :\n        fileX.aiff\n  :\n  :\nFolder_Name_nnn\n    Converted_Files\n        file1.aiff\n        file2.aiff\n             :\n             :\n        fileX.aiff\n\nI have written a bash script that will move file1.aiff, file2.aiff, etc. up one level into Folder_Name_n and then delete \"Converted_Files\".\nAutomator will only act on one Folder_Name_n at a time.\nWhat I want to do is have automator act on Folder_Name_1, then Folder_Name_2, all the way up to Folder_Name_n.\nHere is my automator script:\n\nHere's the bash script as text:\ncd \"$1\"\ncd Converted_Files\nmv *.aiff ..\nrm .DS_Store\ncd ..\nrm -r Converted_Files\n\nThanks.\n\nA: As you were not too clear on the type of Automator workflow you've created, I'm going to focus primarily on the code you're using in the Run Shell Script action.\nThe following example Automator workflow was created by File > New > Workflow in Automator with a Get Selected Finder Items action and a Run Shell Script action added to it, with the settings as shown in the image farther below.\nTesting was done with a selection containing both files and folders which included both the real targets of the Automator workflow's Run Shell Script action, and others as if accidentally selected if you will. With the following files and folders selected in Finder:\n.\n├── Archive.zip\n├── Folder_Name_1\n├── Folder_Name_2\n├── Folder_Name_3\n├── Foobar\n└── Foobar.txt\n\nThe following expanded tree view, of the selected files and folders shown above, obviously contains both files which are not the real targets of the workflow as well as a folder not containing the expected contents. This was done to test that the example bash code works as expected.\n.\n├── Archive.zip\n├── Folder_Name_1\n│   └── Converted_Files\n│       ├── file1.aiff\n│       └── file2.aiff\n├── Folder_Name_2\n│   └── Converted_Files\n│       ├── file1.aiff\n│       └── file2.aiff\n├── Folder_Name_3\n│   └── Converted_Files\n│       ├── file1.aiff\n│       └── file2.aiff\n├── Foobar\n│   └── Barfoo\n│       └── More Foobar.txt\n└── Foobar.txt\n\n8 directories, 9 files\n\nAfter running the workflow from Automator on the selected files and folders in Finder, the following shows the new expanded tree view of the original selection expanded tree view:\n.\n├── Archive.zip\n├── Folder_Name_1\n│   ├── file1.aiff\n│   └── file2.aiff\n├── Folder_Name_2\n│   ├── file1.aiff\n│   └── file2.aiff\n├── Folder_Name_3\n│   ├── file1.aiff\n│   └── file2.aiff\n├── Foobar\n│   └── Barfoo\n│       └── More Foobar.txt\n└── Foobar.txt\n\n5 directories, 9 files\n\nAs you can see in the image below, and in conjunction with the information presented above, the Automator workflow completed without error and only processed the appropriate target folders even though additional non-targets were sent to the Run Shell Script action as shown above.\nAlso note that additional testing was done with the target folders /Folder_Name_N/Converted_Files/ containing non .aiff content to insure that other then the moved .aiff content did not have to be explicitly deleted, e.g. rm .DS_Store was not necessary, as the -r option of the rm command will attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument. You might also consider using the -f option too. (I've already added it to my example bash code, so remove it if you don't want to use that option.)\n\nExample bash code for the Run Shell Script action:\nfor d in \"$@\"; do\n    [ -d \"$d\" ] || continue \n    if [ -d \"$d/Converted_Files\" ]; then\n        cd \"$d/Converted_Files\" || exit \n        for f in *.aiff; do\n            mv \"$f\" ..\n        done\n    fi\n    cd ..\n    rm -rf \"Converted_Files\"\ndone\n\n\nNote that the example bash code is just that, and may not contain all error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted. The onus is always upon the user to implement any appropriate/needed/wanted error handling with whatever code one chooses to use.\nTesting was preformed under macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n", "Q: Have the snooze buttons on the iPhone changed? For as long as I can remember, I’ve been snoozing my iPhone SE’s alarm by pressing a button on the phone. As far as I can remember, any button would do - home, volume, on/off. \nNow, if I press the home button when my alarm goes off, it turns the alarm off completely, instead of snoozing it. The other buttons still snooze.\nHas this actually changed, or am I just losing my mind?\niOS 12.1.2 iPhone SE. \n\nA: It looks like this has been around for a while.\nI found an iOS 10 user complaining that the Home Button shut off the alarm:\n\nturning on the phone (pressing the home button) shuts off the alarm!\n\n(Source)\nI also found several articles form a while back explaining you can use the Home Button to stop your alarm. \nJust tested and the Home Button also stops it for me. \nIt could possibly be you thought you pressed another button that you didn’t, or maybe you were using another app or jailbreak tweak.\n", "Q: Triggering Launch Agents for path in sandboxed app using WatchPaths does not work I am trying to create a user LaunchAgents that will trigger a script when a path managed by a sandbox app will change (in my case, when /Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3/Data/Library/Application\\ Support/OmniFocus/OmniFocus.ofocus will change).\nFor this, I want to use the WatchPaths key of launchd, I already tried with a Folder Action, but those are limited to file addition in a folder.\nI have made a working test to listen on a file and folder in my home directory and trigger a notification. e.g.:\n<?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“UTF-8”?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC “-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN” “http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd”>\n<plist version=“1.0”>\n<dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>me.mayeu.helloworld</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier</string>\n            <string>-message</string>\n            <string>Test</string>      \n        </array>\n        <key>WatchPaths</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/Users/me/watchtest/</string>\n        </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis works well for whatever changes happen under the watchtest folder.\nBut when I replace the WatchPaths key with the OmniFocus database, this does not work anymore (no notification are triggered):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>me.mayeu.script.OmniListen</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier</string>\n      <string>-message</string>\n      <string>Test</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/Users/me/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3/Data/Library/Application\\ Support/OmniFocus/OmniFocus.ofocus</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nI have a feeling that this is due to the sandboxing of the app. But I can't find any documentation about that.\nI am using macOS Mojave 10.14.2.\n\nA: So I found the solution.

So I goto the app bundle and uncheck the \"Cleared for Sale\" box and save it. Then I open the bundle, where it says \"Edit\" I clicked on it and was able to remove the same app from bundle.

Making two bundles when you don’t like the one bundle you already made might not help things. \n", "Q: Is there a way to force iphone 5 to 2.4ghz? Upgraded my wifi router to a Orbi RBK22 with 2.4 and 5. I have a wifi camera that only uses 2.4. To set up the camera on the new router, the iphone with the camera setup app, must both be on 2.4. Problem is the Orbi auto uses 5 if the device (iphone in this case) is capable. There is no way to set up a 2.4 ssid and a 5 ssid in the Orbi where one can select the particular channel and stay on that channel. So one approach is to have my iphone 5 on 2.4.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: In iOS there is no option to force selecting 2.4Ghz wifi network.\nIf you have the possibility to change the SSID on the router to set two SSID like :\n\n\n*\n\n*Wifi_24\n\n*Wifi_5\n\n\nYou'll be able to choose which network use and then configure your camera on the 2.4GHz Wifi.\n\nA: In my experience, temporarily disabling or renaming 5Ghz on your WiFi router is the best solution.\nAssuming your 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz signals share an SSID and subnet, you can follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable 5Ghz on your router or rename the 5Ghz signal to a different SSID, while keeping the 2.4Ghz SSID the same as before, like from SSID_name (for both 2.4 and 5) to SSID_name and SSID_5.\n\n*Set up your 2.4Ghz device.\n\n*When setup is completed and your device is connected, re-enable your 5Ghz signal or rename your 5Ghz SSID to match the 2.4Ghz SSID.\n\n\nThe point of temporarially renaming or disabling only the 5Ghz is that you will keep the same SSID for all currently connected devices, 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. Changing both SSIDs means that all devices will have to connect to a new network.\nYour 2.4Ghz-only devices will stay connected to 2.4Ghz and your 5Ghz-capable devices will choose the best of both frequencies. Generally speaking, the only time you'll see weirdness like this is while setting up a smart device, which is what you are doing.\n\nA: I had a printer only compatible with 2.4Ghz and could not configure it because my router is a newer version that automatically select the band and only expose one network name (thank you Spectrum). Since the network for the printer is configured with the same network as the smartphone/laptop, the printer would try to connect to the 5Ghz band and fail. Router options were very limited and did not allow disabling the 5Ghz band.\nEventually, I made the phone forget the wifi network, and the printer asked me the network name and password instead of automatically taking the credentials from the phone and it worked.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I have a light strip that can only be connected on 2.4.  I have an att router and was able to get it to work by going to my router gateway and restarting my 5ghz connection.  I connected my light strip while the 5 ghz was restarting because the 2.4 was still available.\nI hope this helps everyone who has this problem.\n", "Q: Possible to Disable Screensaver? What I'd like to achieve\nOn my Macbook Pro with latest macOS - every X minutes, the screensaver turns on for X seconds, then the screensaver turns off. This application by defaults runs every time the MBP turns on, with the option to disable.\nQuestion\nI've started to create this using Automator but I'm stuck at disabling/turning off the screen saver. Is it possible to do this through Automator or is there another way to achieve this?  \n\nA: For MacOS 10.15.4 Catalina, you can start a screen saver after 15 minutes and then stop after 15 seconds you can use the following Automator Application.  \n\nYou then need it to launch at login, by going into System Preferences>User and Groups>Login Items and add your screen Saver Application. \n\n\nA: In Lion you can stop screensaver with killall ScreenSaverEngine.  In automator you would pick \"Run Shell Script\" and then enter it there - something like this :\n\nTo make it repeat you could add another 'Pause' even at the start and a 'Loop' event at the end so you application runs, for example :\n\n\n*\n\n*'Pause' 30 minutes\n\n*'Start' screen saver\n\n*'Pause' 1 minute\n\n*'Run Shell Script' - killall ScreenSaverEngine to stop screen saver\n\n*'Loop' - automatically 99999999 times.  This is the maximum on Lion - your version may be different.\n\n\nYou can then save application somewhere and add it to Login Items.  You should set screensaver to 'never' in system preferences also so it doesn't confuse the issue.\n", "Q: PowerPoint's save as PDF in AppleScript results in print job I have a small AppleScript to save a PowerPoint pptx file as PDF from command line. I use the script every 6 months, and last autumn it still worked. But today I run into problems. I updated to 10.14 in the meantime, and I guess there were also quite some Office for Mac updates. But as I have no clue about where this problem is coming from, these can also be completely irrelevant information.\nThe problem with the script is: When calling the script, it doesn't save a PDF, but sends the file to the default printer.\nHere is the already updated, but still not working script:\non run arguments\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set src to POSIX file (first item of arguments) as alias\n        set dest to (second item of arguments) as text\n\n        open src\n        delay 10\n\n        tell application \"Microsoft PowerPoint\"\n            save in dest as save as PDF\n            close\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nAs there is not much code, and as the script did work before, I have no idea on what is wrong with it now.\n@MaxWyss's comment brought me to look at the script from command line. I executed the few steps as arguments via osascript:\n$ osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"' -e 'set fileAlias to POSIX file (\"file:///Users/me/folder/file.pptx\") as alias' -e 'set theOutputPath to (\"file:///Users/me/folder/test.pdf\") as text' -e 'open fileAlias' -e 'delay 10' -e 'tell application \"Microsoft PowerPoint\"' -e 'save in theOutputPath as save as PDF' -e 'end tell' -e 'end tell'\n281:320: execution error: Microsoft PowerPoint got an error: Parameter error. (-50)\n\nI'm a little surprised about the error message, so I tried to run the script again:\n$ osascript pptx2pdf.scpt file:///Users/me/folder/file.pptx test.pdf\npptx2pdf.scpt: execution error: Microsoft PowerPoint got an error: Parameter error. (-50)\n\nI don't know why I overlooked this error. I guess it is due to the many things I changed in the script. However, this is the error message, which, unfortunately, still leaves me without a clue, as the slides still get sent to the printer queue.\n\nA: It took me a few hours to come up with a solution that works in my environment.\nPlease note that some elements need internationalization like \"Vorschau\" or \"Sichern\". This is a german solution working with PowerPoint for Mac 16.16.27 on macOS HighSierra 10.13.6.\nI had to heavily debug things with Script Debugger ($99 well spent ..) to get things working.

Nor if I change the sent mail sound to one of the other sound options.\niPad volume, and sent mail sounds are the only solutions I have found, but do not apply.

Anything else to try?\n\nA: General > Reset > Reset All Settings\nSolved the problem with a hack.  Which just means iOS does not do what you tell it, and needs to be reset as it is not written properly.  Frustrating, but would have liked to know why the sounds were not sounding\n\nA: The problem is most likely the position of your side switch. \nLocating your Side Switch\nThe side switch is located at the side of your iPad:\n\nThis is most likely in the mute position. If your side switch is set to lock the orientation of the device go to Settings -> General to change it.\n\nIf you don't have a side switch\nSome iPad's don't have the side switch. On these iPad's you can un-mute sounds from the Control Centre. To access it, swipe down from the top-right and look for the bell icon.If the icon is red your iPad is muted.\nOther solutions\nIf your iPad isn't on mute try these other solutions try restarting your iPad.\n", "Q: How can I prevent having to restart Safari when blocking sites via /etc/hosts file? I have modified my /etc/hosts file to block website.com and www.website.com.\nI know the formatting of my hosts file is correct because when I restart Safari, the block takes effect. I can also enter into a private window, and the block takes effect. If I do not take any action, Safari will eventually start blocking the sites from my host file after about 5 minutes. Is therany wayay I can expedite this?\nWhen I test in Chrome, there is no need to restart Chrome, my blocks immediately start working.\nI've attempted:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nand\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nI've also read attempted all of the formatting suggestions on stack exchange for the etc/hosts file, but nothing seems to work.

For example, if you have another phone with a data plan - tether to that hotspot instead of using WiFi or find a different WiFi.\nI don't think it's local to your device - but if you did suspect that still after exhausting the things you can control and waiting it out, you could back up the device and wipe all contents and settings. Then sign in and download only the two apps.\nIf you still have issues on a newly wiped device, then the store support team is really your next move. If that works, then you know it was a store caching setting - wipe the device again and then restore from the backup and things should be good to go.\nExcellent notes and troubleshooting, I think you're close to a solution to these two apps not behaving in the store app for you.\n", "Q: macOS is \"Unable to Check for Updates\" The hard drive on my iMac died & I had it replaced.

Did not run it again.\nNo clue how to remove this without disabling SIP which is not something I necessarily want to do, nor would I know how to exactly find \"Finder\". \nIt also seems to be using some exploit to grant itself Automation privileges even after you uncheck them via some memory issue that triggers the memory warning. \nHow can malware like this be cleaned?\n\nA: I wouldn't disable SIP if you have active malware on your system. If you have another Mac you can use or borrow, I'd boot your Mac into Target Disk Mode, connect it to the other Mac with a Thunderbolt cable, and then run both Avira and Malwarebytes on it from the other Mac. This allows the antimalware software to ignore any SIP protection on the TDM'd Mac and perform a full clean.\nIf you can't use another Mac, then install a bootable copy of macOS onto an external drive, boot from that, and do the same.\nIf you can't do either, boot into Safe Mode, run Avira, and then if it finds something, let it clean it and then reboot again into Safe Mode. Now run Malwarebytes and do the same. Always reboot after a pass where it found something, because whatever it is that it found may be preventing you from finding anything further until you reboot with it gone.\n", "Q: What speed does maps.app use when calculating walking times I like walking to places. Before I leave I see how long it will take me to walk there in the maps.app. Often, I find I get there 15% faster than the time displayed on my iPhone. But again I am quite young and walk faster than usual. \nHumans walk around 1.4 metres/second. What speed does the maps.app use to calculate walking travel times?\n\nA: My Map is set to miles, but you could do the same for kilometres..\nDrop a pin & keep moving it until it says it will take an hour to walk there.\nCheck the distance.\nMine says 2.8 miles.\nGoogle tells me 2.8 mph is approx 1.25 m/s\n", "Q: Mail app sends my IP in email headers I just sent my first email using the Mail app through a fully functional email Postfix+Dovecot server. \nI am worried by the fact that it also sends my IP address and hostname along with it.\nThe header that is causing this is Received:\nReceived: from mycomp-mbp.domain_not_set.invalid (cpe-IP-HERE.dynamic.ISPHERE.net [IPHERE]) by mydomain.com (Postfix) with ESMTPSA id 70F1D1B459 for <recipient.of.email@gmail.com>; Fri, 1 Feb 2019 11:17:45 +0100 (CET)\n\nHow can I instruct Mail app to not send this information along the way?\n\nA: That line is added by the machine that received the mail from your Mac, so you don't get to control that from Mail.app or macOS.\nThis is very intentional, so unless your mail company wants to be taking responsibility for all the mails you send them, they might not be willing to \"own\" the mails you ask them to forward.\nThe machine that received the mail already knows the IP address and what it thinks is your host name so you would open a ticket with the team that manages that server if you needed to change the source of your mails or alter that header content in any way.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro won't load desktop on user account My Macbook Pro (running El Capitan) will not load my main user account. After I enter the password it just looks as though it's loading but never displays the desktop. I am able to log into the guest account without a problem and I have even created a new administrator account, but I need to access my old user profile. Any suggestions much appreciated.  \n\nA: It sounds like there is something (possibly) damaged that is preventing log in under your user profile. \nCan you log into that account if you boot your Mac in Safe Mode (holding Shift during boot up)? If so there is a startup item or a preference file that is damaged and causing this problem.\nI have found that temporarily moving the contents of the preferences folder elsewhere (like the desktop) and rebooting often solve such issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to your Mac with the alternative administrator account\n\n*Open the /Users/[USERNAME] folder in the Finder\n\n*press ShiftCommand. to reveal the Library folder of the account with problems.\n\n*Get Info on that Library folder and click the lock icon and authenticate\n\n*Click the \"+\" icon (lower left corner) and add the current username to the list.\n\n*Select that name in the list and change the Privilege to Read and Write.\n\n*Click the Gear icon and select \"Apply to enclosed items\" from that menu.\n\n\nAll of that to give your current (admin)m account access to your non-working account.\nI would move everything in that user's ~/Library/Preferences folder to another folder in ~/Library (call it oldprefs or some such, the name doesn't matter.)\nOnce that has completed reboot your Mac and log in with the problematic account and hopefully login will be successful.\nIf it is then proceed to use your Mac as you would normally. Some apps will have gone back to their default configurations. Registration may need to be reapplied, settings changed back to the way you want them, etc.\nYou can start putting preferences files back in their original folder if you like. I would do it a few at a time, logging out and then back in each time you do it. This will help you narrow down what preference file (if any) was causing the problem.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have multiple branding for the same app in the AppStore? I have an app on the App Store\nDuolingo-like for various topics\nI want to customise the experience based on the user that logs in to my app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change branding (logos, colors, ...)\n\n*Different content in the app\n\n\nUser 1:\nPeter hello@peter.me\nHave access to the topics Gaming with 5 coures\nLogo X, color blue\n\nUser 2:\nSarah sarah123@coolmail.com\nHave access to the topics Travel with 8 courses\nLogo Y, color green\n\nMy question is:\n\nAm I going to be rejected from the store?\n\n(Cause screenshots of the app doesn't reflect my branding)\n\nA: Yes, it is certainly possible. Apple should not reject you for this purpose. It is entirely allowed to have different branding, color schemes, etc. according to the logged in user. \nYou can find the App Store review guidelines here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nAs you'll see there's no section that explicitly allows nor forbids what you want to achieve. This means that what you want to do would normally be considered OK. Make sure that you comply with section 5.2 and do not use intellectual property (logos, branding text, etc.) that is not your to use.\nHowever, if you also offer different functionalities - make sure that you supply the Apple review team with all the functionalities. It is not permitted to have the app reviewed with one set of functionalities, and then let users have a completely different set of functionalities in the app after they login with a specific \"secret\" set of credentials.\nAlso make sure to comply with section 3.1.1 about In-App Purchases, if you want the user to not only have different branding but also have different functionalities after login.\nThe screenshots on the App Store does not have to display all and every type of branding or color scheme possible in the app. There's no requirement for that, so you should not have problems here. However, the screenshots must be a true representation of the app itself - i.e. for example take screenshots of one of the color schemes / branding and use that. I.e. do not use screenshots that are different from what is actually possible to get within the app if you have the right credentials.\n", "Q: Prevent Safari from transforming downloaded CSV files to Numbers files On a computer that has Numbers installed, downloading a CSV file will automatically be converted to a Numbers spreadsheet and no longer be a plain CSV (not just the extension, but the contents themselves are transformed such that they are no longer readable in a text editor or similar). If the machine does not have Numbers on it then this conversion does not take place.\nThe workaround is obnoxious at the time, opening the file in Numbers then saving from there into CSV so it can be actually used as intended.\nIs there anyway to disable this automatic transformation from happening (aside from uninstalling Numbers)?\n\nUpdate: I have tried this on various machines and it is definitely a very spotty behavior. I am teaching Intro CS to a college class and all the students have \"identical\" machines (except whatever modifications they have made after they received them from the college). About 1/4 of the students experience this problem and none of them know why (not very computer-oriented students being a general-education class).\nIt seems that on some computers with Numbers installed, opening a CSV file in Numbers will cause Numbers to convert the file to it's own format, delete the original CSV file, and replace it. I can't find a setting for this, but on certain student laptops this is always reproducible.\nAdditionally, on some computers with Numbers installed, the mime-type text/csv (what the particular server is serving those files as) is considered a 'safe' file and then auto-opened with Numbers, as per How to stop Safari from unzipping files after download\nSo one solution is following @CraigStodolenak solution which causes Safari to them auto-open the file with a different program and the auto-conversion then never happening.\nOnce I get access to another machine like this I will also try the ⌥ alt trick that disables auto-opening for a single link in Safari.\nAs a side note, on my own machine from the school and another loaner I have received I cannot reproduce the issues with auto-opening or auto-transforming.\n\nA: Safari does not post process files or transform them. It saves them exactly as the web server sends them or it throws an error code.\nThe worst thing Safari could do is decide the file is “Safe” and open it in the default application. You should disable opens safe files on Safari and then re-download the files in question.\nFinder controls which apps open which file, so if you decide to re-enable “open safe files” be sure to chose TextEdit or another file to open .csv files or delete Numbers so that there’s no default Application for these files.\nIn more detail on the Finder opening - macOS keeps track of which apps open specific file types. When Numbers is installed, Apple matches all .CSV files to Numbers. To change this, Get Info (⌘-I) on a .CSV file in the Finder and perform the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*under Open With dropdown, select a different app to open this type of file (TextEdit, BBEdit, SublimeText, Atom, etc.)\n\n*click on Change All... button\n\n*click on Continue\n", "Q: How to find lost Safari password on iPhone I need to know how to access a password that I lost on my iPhone.

From here, I wasn't able to kill those processes.  \nI tried to restart or shutdown the system, since I wasn't able to do anything else, but those also failed. I was only able to power cycle.\nMy thought was to run a killall from the terminal but I can not get a functioning shell / terminal window once the system is blocked. \nAre there better ways to handle such a situation when processes grow out of proportions?\n\nA: Your machine definately has too many processes running which is the typical reason for that error message and aligns with Activity monitor. Since you can't restart or shut down, I would have only the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*quit any / all apps you can and very quickly get a new terminal / shell running. There's small chance you will get a process before the runaway one uses up any freed resources, but you might get lucky: you only need one fork/exec/thread to get a shell. \n\n\nIf not, you will likely need to try escalating steps like log out of the user session and then back in. (or restart or shut down or pulling the power or holding the power button to disrupt all power and hard halt the machine.)\nMaybe sshd is running and you could attempt that or Remote Desktop to connect as a second user if you have both screen sharing and another account set up. Again, it's not likely the system stat will allow new processes, but it's worth trying.\nSorry the  VShildScanner process is misbehaving.

The Exchange Mailbox account only updates once I click Mailbox > Rebuild.\nAccording to the Connection Doctor (Window > Connection Doctor), all connections work properly. Outgoing mail also works. With the same setup on my iPhone 6, iOS 12.1.13, there are no issues and the inbox updates promptly.

My Gmail (IMAP) account in Apple Mail works as expected.\n\nHow can I troubleshoot the issue, when one of several mailboxes won’t show new mails?\n\nA: As MS Exchange keeps all of your data on the server there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't just remove that account. Delete any leftover mailboxes from mail.app and then re-add the Exchange account. I find that often fixes issues between mail.app and Exchange.\nAs an aside I stopped using mail.app for exchange connectivity (for work) for reasons that there are times when mail.app, Calendar, contacts, reminders, etc. just don't behave as expected when connecting to an Exchange server.

To be more explicit: \n\n\n*\n\n*The problem started showing up, very suddenly, about two weeks ago. It affected my two macOS machines, one located at my institution, the other by broadband at home. I could get the messages fine via iOS or Outlook itself (standalone or web). \n\n*Generally rebuilding immediately showed all new messages.\n\n*These problems were not fixed by completely removing the accounts and re-entering them (not just disabling and re-enabling them).\n\n*I did notice that, at least occasionally, even if I didn't rebuild, messages would sometimes show up several hours later.\n\n\nHowever, over last weekend (a period when I logged into my machines less often than usual), messages started appearing in a more timely fashion. As of this week, things seem to be back to normal, at least for now.\nVery curious, but at least it's working. \nAlso, FWIW (and for search purposes in the future), a few other bits of evidence for very similar problems over many macOS releases: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8086520\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8152487\nOP @Christopher, do you have any updates?\n\nA: Same problem here: university-based Exchange account seems to download emails correctly but they don't actually show up in my InBox until I do a \"Rebuild.\" One further symptom: after the Rebuild, the contents of some messages do not display, instead of a message content I see a blank screen.

Specs are 2.4 GHz Intel Core Duo, 2GB RAM. I bought it for my gf (now wife) around 2008 and we have not used it in the last couple of years.\nThe OS and the software as a whole are rather outdated and I am most concerned about safety issues. So I would like to upgrade it and use it for some specific tasks.\nProblem is: the link from the App Store to upgrade to El Capitan fails because I cannot upgrade but it doesn't tell me the reason. Space on disk is plenty (just above 36 GB).\nWhat can I do? It would be a shame to be unable to use it. Is there some other upgrade path? Is there some other solution to make this box as usable (safely!) as possible?\n\nA: Do you have another Mac that you can use to download the El Capitan installer (you should be able to access the link from any Mac running High Sierra or below). Then you can just install it on the old MacBook from there, or from an external drive. Sometimes you have to find ways to work around the roadblocks Apple puts up. But you should have no problem upgrading that machine to at least El Capitan (my 2008 MacBook unibody is currently running Mojave, thanks to a patched version of macOS, but El Cap is the last officially support version for those machines).\nTo answer your security question, according to Apple’s security updates page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222 they are still issuing security updates to El Capitan and to the version of Safari running on it, so you should be in good shape as long as you can get your Mac upgraded.\np.s. I’d recommend maxing out the RAM and swapping out the slow spinning HDD for an SSD to breathe new life into the machine. Whatever you choose to run will work a whole lot better with an SSD especially.\n", "Q: Launch homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq when NIC becomes available? I am running homebrew dnsmasq on my Mac. \nDsmasq is configured to only respond to traffic on one NIC (en7). \nen7 is a usb-c ethernet adapter. \nWhen this adapter is not active (not plugged in, switch not switched on) homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq is spamming my system logs that dnsmasq cannot be started because the NIC is not available. Retrying every 1 second.\nI know the KeepAlive.NetworkState key can make that homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq only launches when a network is available. The issue is that there is ALWAYS a network available, my Wifi adapter is always on. \nWhat i am looking for is a way to launch homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq only when en7 becomes available (adapter plugged in and switch switched on).\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Not possible....\nFrom https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\nNetwork Availability \nIf your daemon depends on the network being available, this cannot be handled with dependencies because network interfaces can come and go at any time in OS X. To solve this problem, you should use the network reachability functionality or the dynamic store functionality in the System Configuration framework. This is documented in System Configuration Programming Guidelines and System Configuration Framework Reference. For more information about network reachability, see Determining Reachability and Getting Connected in System Configuration Programming Guidelines.\n", "Q: Group Significant locations by date instead of location I find the \"Signficant locations\" feature in IOS very useful.\n(Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> System Service -> Significant Locations)\nI will look through it when I do my time/billing as a reminder of where I've been. \nHowever it groups the data by location, so if I want to find out where I was last Tuesday, I have to check every location in the list to try and see if that date is present. \nIs there a 3rd party app that uses that very same data that groups it differently?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this can't be changed and I don't know a way to retrieve this data.\nThere is an app that does this. Find My Family, Friends, Phone. Whilst the main use is family tracking it can be used to see location history. It offers 7 days history and 30 if you pay.\nAnother app that offers this is Google Maps. It offers a Your Time Line feature. You can see a history of each day. While not listing the places like iOS it is very similar.\n", "Q: APFS Volume not claiming available APFS Container space I'm at my wit's end with this, and I can't find anything about it in documentation or questions, so I thought I'd ask one.\nI had an APFS Fusion Drive that included two drives: (120+500) GB. I cloned (dd) the 500 GB drive to another 1 TB drive and exchanged it. All good so far, except the 1 TB drive acts as a 500 GB, as expected.\nI boot into recovery mode and after getting the proper disk identifier of the APFS Container Scheme (disk2, in this case) and unlocking the volume, I tried:\n-bash-3.2# diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk2 0\n\nIt seemed to work, saying that it was \"Growing APFS Physical Store...\", but Disk Utility was still only showing the 500 GB, so I later decided to try 'gpt'. I first removed the partition (2) from the physical disk (disk0), and then re-added it in place with the size expanded to fill the drive (1952915488): \n-bash-3.2# gpt remove -i 2 disk0\ndisk0s2 removed\n-bash-3.2# gpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 1952915488 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\nThis seems to have resized the partition size properly, but the size of the APFS Container Scheme and Volume remain at the original ~620 GB, even though the Physical Store references seem to be correct (disk0s2, disk1s2):\n-bash-3.2# diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         1000.0 GB  disk1s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         119.8 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +619.7 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Stores disk0s2, disk1s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            529.7 GB   disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 23.4 MB    disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                514.0 MB   disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      4.3 GB     disk2s4\n\n-bash-3.2# gpt show disk0\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640  1952415488      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1952825128      700007         \n  1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n-bash-3.2# gpt show disk1\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  234031968      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  234441608          7         \n  234441615         32         Sec GPT table\n  234441647          1         Sec GPT header\n\nI've tried resizeContainer on disk2 again after seeing that the size didn't change to 1.12 TB, but I get the following, which makes sense since disk1s2 is already resized:\nError: -69743: The new size must be different than the existing size\n\nDisk Utility, however, recognizes the Fusion Drive as 1.12 TB, but the Container and Volume are still limited to 620 GB, and trying to partition the volume shows that there is a giant usable 1.12 TB partition:\n\n\n\n\nSo I must've not understood something or done something wrong, but I appreciate any help in getting to use that stubborn extra space on the drive!\n\nA: It may be that one of the EFI partitions is getting in the way of the resize.  Please see this thread Can't extend APFS after erasing old partition as free space.  \nAlso check out the last comment to the article here.  In this case, the person had an \"Apple kernel dump\" partition interfering.\nSo, in summary, it may just merely be the partition layouts thats causing the problem. Hopefully this points you in the right direction\n\nA: For those seeking an answer, I'm sorry to say I bit the bullet and restored from a Time Machine backup as I was starting to get false errors that there was no space left even when ~80 GB would show as available, so there was probably a borked partition in the way.\nBefore attempting a Time Machine restore from the recovery volume, make sure you have a bootable installation USB of Mojave. I ran into the problem where internet recovery for older Macs doesn't download the Mojave recovery partition and the APFS volumes and containers are not recognized to restore to.\n", "Q: Unlike other folders, dragging apps out of /Applications create an alias. What controls this behavior? I usually install Cyberduck by dragging the .app bundle into the Applications folder on the root of my hard drive (/Applications). However, on macOS versions 10.7 Lion and newer, if I later decide to move Cyberduck to my desktop, Finder will create an alias by default, instead of actually moving the .app bundle.\nBy contrast, if I instead install Cyberduck to my user Applications folder (~/Applications), and later attempt to drag Cyberduck to my desktop, the .app bundle will be moved like any other file.\nWhat makes the /Applications folder so special? Is it possible to add the same behavior to another folder, or—if SIP is disabled—to modify /Applications to behave like a normal folder?\n\nA couple things I have already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications is owned by root:admin. However, sudo chown root:admin ~/Applications has no effect on dragging behavior.\n\n*Inside of a test VM, I renamed /Applications to /Applications2. The renamed Applications2 folder retained the same dragging behavior as before, suggesting that the functionality is not hard-coded to a specific path.\n\n\nA: Sadly, the premise behind this question was flawed. I originally posted this observation:\n\nInside of a test VM, I renamed /Applications to /Applications2. The renamed Applications2 folder retained the same dragging behavior as before, suggesting that the functionality is not hard-coded to a specific path.\n\nUnfortunately, this only remains true until a restart of Finder. In other words, if I rename the /Applications to /Applications2, Applications2 will retain its special dragging behavior only until Finder is restarted! If I killall Finder, Applications2 will gain normal dragging behavior.\nThis also works in reverse—a user-created directory moved to /Applications will gain special dragging behavior when Finder is restarted.\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the behavior is hard coded to specific paths, and cannot be changed. I'm disappointed, but it does make sense. I do wonder if these hardcoded Finder paths are stored in a config file somewhere that could be changed... but knowing Apple, probably not.\n", "Q: How to remove text services? I know service workflows created from Automator can be removed from ~/Library/Services, but I cannot see any services related to selected text there.\nSee my screenshots\n\nI must have installed apps that added such services the LaTeX series in the screenshot, which shows up in the context menu when right-clicking text in apps like Notes.\nHow to remove these services then?\n\nA: OK, found it myself. Under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, I can uncheck those 3rd-party services. \n", "Q: Disable automatic phone number linking in iOS Safari On my iPhone, Safari sometimes thinks that some sequences of numbers are phone numbers, and automatically formats them as links to call that phone number. For example, if you read this question on an iPhone, the number sequence 7844589738 will be formatted as a phone number even though it isn't meant to be.\nI find this particularly annoying since a lot of number sequences on pages I visit aren't actually phone numbers, but other number sequences like IP addresses, post IDs, etc, and I have never called a phone number that I found on a website. So I would like to disable this feature, but I can't find any setting that does so.\nI searched the web for a way to disable this, but all I found were pages that explain how to disable it on my site on all iPhones (using HTML and stuff like that), but I want to disable it on my iPhone on all sites.\nIs there a way to keep iOS Safari from automatically formatting number sequences as phone numbers?\n\nA: This is currently not possible on Safari or any other stock application. The only way this is possible if the website developer adds some Meta Data code.\nRelated:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8185290?answerId=32662540022#32662540022\n", "Q: Can't find 'Apps & Data screen > Move Data from Android' option in IPhone XS I'm trying to move contacts from Android but can't find the option in the IOS device.

I anyone has a suggestion of a better forum to go to, please tell me.\nDoes anyone have any idea how I might fix the USB Drive?\n\nA: \"Cannot write to last block of device\" is usually a connectivity error - it often crops up on HDs & SSDs with a bad cable.\nFor it to happen on a USB stick, then I'd say either the contacts are dirty or the device is dead [or dying].\nYou could try cleaning up the contacts with a bit of contact cleaner, then push/pulling the stick a dozen times in & out of a [non-powered] USB socket.\nIf that gains nothing, then I'm reasonably certain that if it's failing on three different machines, then it's had it.\n", "Q: Launch daemon not running on boot I've been following the migration guide for macOS Server and have gotten stuck with the launch .plist for the BIND (named) DNS server.

According to the Homebrew homepage:\n\nHomebrew won’t install files outside its prefix and you can place a Homebrew installation wherever you like.\n\nAccording to the lynx man page:\n\nLYNX_CFG            This variable, if set, will override the default\n  location and name of  the  global  configuration  file  (normally,\n                         lynx.cfg) that was defined by the LYNX_CFG_FILE constant in the userdefs.h file, during installation.\n\nIn some linux distribution, the constant LYNX_CFG_FILE in set to ~/.lynxrc (as I remember) but in Homebrew  this constant is left to its default value.

I wish to visualize it with different colour for text and page background.\nWhile I am easily able to change the colour of the text, I am unable to do so for the page itself. Searching the Web lead me to the Apple Support document, Pages for Mac: Change the page background in Pages which wasn't useful, as I was not able to find the relevant option in Pages.app.\nI am using the current latest Pages version 7.3 (5989) running on macOS Mojave 10.14.3.\n\nA: Per that support document, you can only change the background colour of a Page Layout document, or one of its master pages. By default, Pages creates new documents as Word Processing documents (which don't have master pages), so you will need to select File > Convert to Page Layout before the background fill option appears.\nNote that this will remove any body text that you'd previously entered, so you might need to start with a new document, convert that to Page Layout, and copy your content over.\n", "Q: Does the FaceTime eavesdropping bug affect iOS11 devices? According to CNN Business the FaceTime eavesdropping bug affects iOS 12.1 with group calling, but I'm wondering if anyone was able to reproduce a variant of this bug on pre-iOS12? CNN Business seems to suggest it can be reproduced even in one-on-one calls, but I'm not sure how reliable their tech articles are.\nIs anyone aware of this, or a similar eavesdropping bug, being reproduced on older iOS versions? \n\nA: There are no public vulnerabilities for iOS 11 being affected by this specific bug or any of similar function or scope.\nAs far as the bug from late January on iOS 12 - Group FaceTime is disabled globally since 1/28 so no devices are vulnerable.\nBefore the service was suspended, only devices with Group FaceTime capabilities could be exploited or considered vulnerable.\nDevices on iOS 11 were not affected and won’t be until/unless that feature is added to an update to iOS 11. \nLooking back, the steps to reproduce the bug involved dialing a contact via FaceTime, and before they picked up, dialing a second contact to initiate a Group FaceTime.

Is there a way to add web links to the home screen that will avoid using the PWA view?\nThe website is https://www.universalhub.com\n\nA: I actually found a work-around for this by referencing an answer on another question.\n\nShort answer: yes!\nI faced the same issue and basically tricked my iPad, you simply turn on airplane mode, you don't hit the redirect, you store the \"server not found\" page on the home screen and you are done :-)\nHope you can now resolve your 4 year old question.\n\nThe only addition to this method is that now on iOS 12 you need to turn on airplane and turn off wifi in order to drop all network connections.\nBig thanks to Von Lion\n", "Q: Change File Open Dialog to have Date Updated/Modified instead of Date Added For the Finder app the Date Modified is shown as desired: \n\nHowever in the File Open dialog it is not:\n\nHow can the File Open dialog be adjusted to show Date Modified instead of Date Added ?\n\nA: Just the same as in the Finder - right click anywhere on the header bar [Name, Size, Kind etc] & you can add or remove data types as you wish\n\nYou can then drag the columns into your preferred order & sort by clicking any header.\n", "Q: Moving SSD harddrive to another Mac I currently have my data and apps on a 2009 13\" MacBook Pro and want to move to a 2012 13\" MacBook Pro.  I want to move my SSD to the new computer as the new one has a standard SATA drive.  I am currently running Yosemite 10.10.5 and the new one is running Mojave.  \nIs the new computer going to start up with the change? \n\nA: I don’t recommend moving drives or even loading a bootable copy. I do recommend a clean OS install and then running migration assistant. That tool has custom code to handle all sorts of useful functions like driver incompatibilities, disabling incompatible software and you just get a fresh clean install with your data and accounts on top. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350 (Migration KB)\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462 (Target Disk Mode KB)\n\n\nUse target disk for the migration Even if you have a solid back up. You could also migrate from your back up.\nIf you decide to just move the data directly, target mode helps there too.\nPlace the old Mac into target disk mode and connect with FireWire/Thunderbolt to the new Mac and the new Mac can boot from the old Mac so you can be sure all the drivers and data are good.\nnote, USB-C target disk is available on very recent machines as well, but FW/TB is more ubiquitous\nAlways boot and test before you remove any drive and same with moving the SSD. you'll need to get the iFixit or another tear down for the exact models and validate that the form factor and connectors are compatible. Then you will know that physically it should work, data wise it will work so if you put the drive in and it doesn't work, you don't have to guess - you'll know everything was fine except the connections.\nGood luck - feel free to ask a follow on question if you can't find the repair manuals for each Mac. There is probably a general question here showing how to take a serial number or the About this Mac to get the exact model number and marketing year.\nFor me - the colloquially named 2015 MacBook or \"MacBook One\" is precisely:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*MacBook8,1\n\n\nA: Generally, a drive with an installation of MacOS will work on any 'contemporary' hardware (i.e. hardware for which the OS is compatible). I have swapped bootable storage devices across a range of different Macs over the years with few problems, including 'transplanting' a drive from a 2009 MacBook into a 2012 MBP.\nYou should reset the NVRAM on first boot, to clear any settings that may relate to the old hardware. Instructions here\nAt worst, you may need to re-run the OS installer over the disk (from an external installer disk or from the Recovery Partition), which will update anything necessary while keeping your data preserved in place.\nIt's always good to have a USB to SATA cable, so that you can run the old drive as an bootable external, \"just in case\". \nObviously, the old Hard Drive won't work in the 2009 MBP (Mojave is too new for it, and the disk might be APFS) without repartitioning and a new installation of MacOS. I don't think that model has Firmware Recovery, so you'll need to do this on the old machine first.\nNB: Always have a backup!\n", "Q: Once I’ve lost Icon data stored in Resource Fork saving to NTFS, can those files be repaired? How can I repair the Icon in Resource Fork from a folder copied to a NTFS disk?\nI recently backed up my dying SSD onto a NTFS drive using an older Snow Leopard Machine and almost all my data was saved. But all the folders lost their associated icons in this process. Some icon creators distribute their work in this way, assigning icons to folders and no contents in them.\nI still have a file inside each folder named \"Icon?\" or \"IconˆM\" (when using the tab to complete its name in the terminal). This file is 0 bytes in size every time.\nIs it possible to recover all these icons from all these folders containing the \"Icon?\" file?\n\nA: Repairing would mean you have a backup of the data that was lost. The resource data is gone if the size of the file is 0 bytes.\nLook for backup copies of the apps or installers / download the apps / folders icons from a file system where that data was encoded correctly or support data and resource forks natively.\n", "Q: Unable to log into any accounts (regular or root) After starting up macOS Sierra, I am unable to log into any accounts (regular or root). I don't recall making any changes to system files or user accounts, so am generally puzzled by this.\n\nA: The issue seems to have been that I accidentally added a tag (in Finder) to the root user's home directory (`/private/root). Removing it fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Does iPad still use its battery when it is connected and fully charged? I use my iPad on my desk with a stand everyday and it is connected to usb cable, which also charges iPad. It usually stays at 100% charge since my cable is connected.\nIn this case...does my iPad still use the battery? Does it still decrease lifespan of my iPad battery?\n\nA: No, the battery is not used once it is fully charged.\nHowever, the battery life is getting depleted.  Keeping the battery charged at 100% keeps it at a high voltage, and this voltage is detrimental to the life of the battery.  This is the reason that Apple introduced an option to \"Smart-charge\" the battery to a lower percentage (80% is Apple's standard, but industry-wide 40% is a better choice).\n", "Q: Resetting screen brightness setting in touchbar MacBook Pro during boot Due to a series of unfortunate events, my 2018 15” MacBook Pro found itself out of battery and with screen brightness set to zero.\nI should also mention that I have FileVault full disk encryption enabled, so there’s the intermediate boot step that asks you for your password before fully booting the computer, running apps and (presumably) whatever it is that draws the brightness button in the touchbar.\nBasically, when the computer booted, the screen looked like it was completely blank, and the only thing on the touchbar was the Esc key (in particular, no brightness button). I initially panicked, and tried to reset the SMC, but it made no difference. After a while, I figured out that only the backlight was off, so shining a light into the display allowed to figure out what was being drawn on the screen, and from there I got the computer to boot — with enormous difficulty.\nHowever, the process would have been much easier if I could have reset the brightness to a more usable level.\nGiven that the brightness button on the touchbar is unavailable before boot, what can I do to adjust screen brightness before the computer fully boots?\n\nA: I found this issue with the touchbar not showing anything happens only if you've file vault on.\nAfter booting my system I just assumed it was at the login screen and asking for password. After entering the password it logged me in and the touchbar controls appeared again.\n\nA: I just encountered the same problem.\nAnd this is the window. It's really hard to read text with the lowest brightness. I hope this image helps someone who has the same issue.\n\nIn this screen, you can't select the checkbox by tab key.\nYou have to use mouse cursor that is located at the top-right corner. \nThe problem was solved by clicking the Previous button in my case.\nBy the way, the external display wasn't detected in this screen.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was unbelievable, it's so weird that they didn't think about this edge case. The way I resolved was pressing the right arrow and enter then I typed the password.\n", "Q: Screen Saver Stuck On, How To Escape? Today I encountered a problem with the screen-saver, in which it couldn't be deactivated in order to return to normal work. Normally, hitting escape will deactivate the screen-saver, but this did not work. I could see the mouse pointer over top of the screen-saver, however.\nI use hot-corners to activate the screen-saver, and I could still use those to re-activate the screen-saver, but then the escape key brought me back to the screen-saver \"underneath\", instead of the normal desktop. I could also activate mission control/spaces, and it looked normal, but choosing a desktop just brought me back to the screen-saver.\nSo, a summary of strategies I tried to get the screensaver \"unstuck\":\n\n\n*\n\n*hitting escape\n\n*moving the mouse\n\n*re-activating and de-activating the screensaver via its hot corner\n\n*activating mission control with a hotkey and choosing a desktop\n\n*hitting cmd-opt-escape to try the force quit dialog\n\n\nHow can the screensaver be deactivated without shutting down the machine? I'm running MacOS 10.13.4.\n\nA: I encountered this problem for the last two days on Catalina on my iMac. I tried some suggested methods, but lacked an Apple keyboard, and didn't restart or use SSH.\nWhat eventually worked for me, I didn't find elsewhere:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Cmd+Q\n\n*Esc\n\n*login\n\nHitting Esc makes the screen go black, which I guess cancels the screensaver.\n\nA: Lock & Unlock the Mac\nUse the key-combo Control+Shift+Power on MacBooks or Control+Shift+Eject on Macs with a full-sized keyboard. This will lock the computer, requiring the usual login and password authentication. After re-authenticating, the machine should be back to normal.\nSource: UWGB\n\nA: I've still been having this same issue while using vnc to connect to a local Mac Mini (m1 chip, on Monterrey 12.3.1).\nI setup remote ssh, and killing the screen saver with\nkillall ScreenSaverEngine\n\nKills the screen saver, but I'm still left with a non responsive black screen.\nI then tried to manually lock the terminal by using\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nAnd it takes me back to the prompt and brings the remote session back to a responsive state.\nDefinitely not ideal, but the most consistent way out of this issue.\n\nA: If you have SSH enabled on your Mac and access to another computer on the same network you can start a terminal session and kill the screensaver.  For example, I would open a terminal on my Linux PC and SSH into the Mac then run the following command:\nkillall ScreenSaverEngine\n\nNOTE: This will not unlock the session if the screen is also locked.  It will simply dim and reappear.  This solution only applies after entering the password to unlock the screen but the screensaver does not dismiss.\n\nA: None of the key commands worked for me, but unplugging the machine from USB and power and letting it go to sleep, then waking it up again, did.\nVery strange bug.\n\nA: I had to put my iMac to sleep with\nOption ⌥+Cmd ⌘+Eject ⏏ in order to dismiss the screensaver and then log in.\nOther possible button ways to put your mac to sleep:\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold Power for 1.5 seconds\n\n*Option ⌥+Cmd ⌘+Power\n\n*Ctrl ⌃+Shift ⇧+Power\n\n*Ctrl ⌃+Shift ⇧+Eject ⏏\n\n*Ctrl ⌃+Power\n\n*Ctrl ⌃+Eject ⏏\n\nA: After using one of the answers by @Cyberthal or by @CoderGuy to get in, you may want to fix the problem for the future.\nAs shown here, you need to add 2 preferences to\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.PowerManagement.$UUID.plist where $UUID is your \"Hardware UUID\".\nTo get your Hardware UUID:\nUUID=$(system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/UUID/ { print $NF }')\n\nThen add these:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.PowerManagement.$UUID.plist \"AC Power\" -dict-add \"System Sleep Timer\"  0\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.PowerManagement.$UUID.plist \"AC Power\" -dict-add \"Display Sleep Timer\" 0\n\nAnd reboot for the settings to take effect.\n", "Q: Why does this shell-script dim my bash colors?

You will need to upload your recording to a computer and use a audio editing application like Audacity I’m not affiliated with the software.\n\niTunes does not have a way to do that.

When I click on a YouTube video the browser always adds this extension to the link: \"&frags=pl%2Cwn\".\nExample links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Example123\n\n*Link in Safari: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Example123&frags=pl%2Cwn\nThis problem only occurs when I use my MacBook Pro in Safari (version 12.0.2).\nBoth links work, I've tried it on multiple computers / different web browsers and as far as I see there's absolutely no difference.\nWhen I click on a video in YouTube the link gets added automatically, but I can remove it manually and the page just loads again without the extension (like a refresh of the page).\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does this happen?\n\n*Has anybody else encountered this problem (Maybe it's a user-specific problem)?\n\n\nA: The Youtube webapp is adding that to the link (or URL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL).\nThe characters after the question mark in the link is the query string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). It's one of the ways data can be passed to the server. The \"v\" parameter specifies which video to show. The ampersand (\"&\") separates parameters.\nI can't find any reference as to what the \"frags\" parameter does. \"%2C\" is a comma (\",\") that's been percent-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), so that part is setting the \"frags\" parameter to \"pl,wn\".\nIt's definitely not a problem. Everything is fine.\n", "Q: How can I add custom items to the Apple menu? I would like to add shortcuts to open apps such as Terminal, Google Chrome, Launchpad etc., or to open a folder as a sub-menu.\nIs it possible to do so? If yes, how do I do it?\nI am running macOS Mojave.\n\nA: The Apple menu is not designed to be customized by anyone. However, I would recommend XMenu (available on the Mac App Store, and also download from here).\nThis handy little app will give you menus in the menu bar that you can customize, either to include the entire Applications folder as a drop-down menu, or you can add aliases to 'Favorite' items.\n\nA: The Apple menu depends on the App displayed in front, to display usefull command for this app.\nIt can't be customized, or you have to create your own app and when it'll be in front you can put whatever shortcuts you want.\nOtherwise, you can put any shortcut you want in the Dock.\n", "Q: There was an error connecting to iCloud When I go to the iCloud screen on my iPhone I get a \"Verification Failed.

I have a Late 2013 MBP whose 1TB SSD (PCIe) decided to suddenly fail last week. I managed to wipe and reformat the drive via target disk mode, but I cannot reinstall macOS from target disk mode (I didn't know that part beforehand). Even after reseating it multiple times my CPU doesn't even know it's there. \nMy plan was to buy a crucial PCIe SSD + Sintech Adapter (Apple uses a propriety PCIe connection) to replace the SSD. In addition to propriety hardware, Apple uses proprietary firmware. The workaround is to update the firmware on the internal SSD before swapping it out, but I cannot access my internal drive from my CPU! \nAs a sidenote, I am confident it's not the logic board since I can boot from an external HDD + there are no issues according to the Apple Diagnostics Test. \nHow do I upgrade without paying $$$$ to Apple in my current predicament?\n\nA: Even though it's a \"vintage\" Mac, it's worth taking it to an Apple Store, if there's one near you, and see if they will look at it and what they would charge. I've often been pleasantly surprised.\nAlternatively, you can often find secondhand Apple SSDs for these Macs on sites like eBay.\nFWIW, you should be able to install MacOS via target mode from another Mac: I've done so with a 2014 MBP, for instance.

So even if you cure your Mac, which you could do and I explained in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251096810 it will most likely be temporary and at some point in time you will notice that the continuous spinning wheel in Notes will get back to nag you. And the non-syncing will be back again.\nA better way is to start using Notes through the web interface, on www.icloud.com directly, and bookmark Notes for direct access.\nIts interface is smooth and complete and will allow flawless syncing with all your other devices like you iPhone and iPad where you leave Notes on.\nNotes on iOS and nowadays also iPadOS however is pretty stable. So if you you these in combination with the Notes web application through the icloud.com website your are fine.\n", "Q: Xcode will not open the Main.storyboard file I had been running Xcode to learn to develop ios Apps. All was working fine but Xcode kept freezing and I'd half to force quit. It was suggested I reintall Xcode. I did that and it seemed to reinstall fine.\nNow, however, Xcode launches but it won't open the Main.storyboard file.  It opens and you can edit the text files but when I try to open Main.storyboard, or LaunchScreen.storyboard, a gear-like icon starts turning but it never loads a file.\nCan someone please help me get Xcode working. \nI'm running High Sierra 10.13.6 and Xcode 10.1.\nHere is the source code for Main.storyboard\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<document

.storyboard files.  This is not the only solution to these issues so YMMV.  From experience I've found that that cleaning the build folder and/or clearing the Derived Data folder are quick & easy first steps in troubleshooting.  \nClean Build Folder\nIn Xcode, open a code window.  Go to the Product -> Clean Build Folder menu command (or use Shift + ⌘ + K). \nDelete Derived Data\nIn macOS 10.12 and later, this folder should be automatically cleared.  Sometimes, manually deleting the files located here will force Xcode to rebuild them, solving some common issues.  There's several ways to do almost the same thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Xcode.  \n\n*In Terminal, run this command: rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n\n\n*In the Xcode Project \n\n\n*\n\n*Shift + alt + command ⌘ + K will delete the folder for that project.\n\n\n*In the Xcode Project\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to File -> Project Settings for a Project, or File -> Workspace Settings for a Workspace\n\n*Click the arrow behind the path to go directly to the Derived Data folder\n\n\n*Close Xcode\n\n*Delete the contents (subfolders) in the Derived Data folder\n\n\n", "Q: Preview Markup Options for Shape Fill Working on a Mac Desktop OS Sierra, want to use Preview to markup a pdf, but need the filled rectangle to be translucent, not opaque.

Much too late, of course, which means that when people start talking in videos they get the first syllables cut off. This also means that short and sudden system alert sounds go completely unnoticed since they've finished playing by the time the audio is capable of playing again. Needless to say, it's a big problem.\nThe whole thing reminds me of those threshold volume levels in video conferences, where you're put on mute until you actually speak so as to not introduce needless noise. \nSome details\n\n\n*\n\n*The problem is with my Macbook Air (2012) — The speaker works fine with the same test video when played from another device, and the problem is reproducible with two different BT speakers.\n\n*The choppiness is not random. This happens as soon as the system goes silent. If the audio is continuous, e.g. music, then there are no gaps (except initially when starting playback, of course).\n\n*It happens regardless of which app is used for playback. I have tested it in browsers and in native media players.\n\n*It is not resolved by turning off and on Bluetooth (using the menubar icon).\n\n*It is not resolved by rebooting the system.\n\n*It occurs regardless of whether the power cord is plugged in or not.\n\n*Did I mention that it's not random? That means it occurs at the same times in the test videos, which means that it's not RF interference. But I shut off wi-fi anyway just to be able to say: turning off wi-fi makes no difference.\n\n*MacOS 10.14.1\n\n\nIs this a known problem? Is there any way to fix it?\nVideo samples have been prepared but will have to wait since I wrongly assumed they could be hosted just like images.\n\nVideo samples\nThe first video is of the problem. The second is of what it should sound like, using the built in Macbook speakers.\nWhat it sounds like\nWhat it's supposed to sound like\n\n\nA: I'm confident at this point that it is the speaker's fault. Buggy design. \nWhy it worked with one audio source device and not the Macbook I don't know, but it's been reproduced with another audio source since then.\nI can't explain how I reproduced it with two different Bluetooth speaker models though. That has not happened since. The two speaker models are by the same brand but can't even play nice with eachother and coexist (selecting one of them connects to the other) so I'm just going to write the whole problem off as cheap hardware/firmware design.\n", "Q: How can I Hide Desktop Icons on Mojave?

This way you can hide all or inidividual item on the desktop.\n", "Q: How to configure MacOS firewall to block outgoing IP ranges? Recently I was watching a Gizmodo journalist's videos about her experiment with blocking outgoing connections to Google, FB, Microsoft and Apple. I wonder if it is possible to modify MacOS's built in firewall to block IP ranges that I specify, like all known FB ranges, coinhive etc.?\nI used to configure ipfw but this seems to have gone away. I'm running Mojave.\nI do not want to run any closed-source program like Little Snitch to accomplish this. I just want to configure Apple's firewall if possible.\n\nA: It's not that complex with use of Pf firewall that's been ported from OpenBSD to MacOS quite a while ago. The whole ruleset could be as simple as:\n#\n# Block outgoing connections to IP ranges given in a table\n#\n\n# A persistent table to keep a list of IP networks for blocking\ntable <toBlockOut> persist { 0.1.2.3/32 }\n\n# local TCP/IP is always allowed\npass quick on lo0\n\n# Attempts to send packets to IP networks kept in the table\n# should never work\nblock out quick to <toBlockOut> no state\n\nAfter you've saved that minimal ruleset into say pf-block-out.conf file, you can apply it with sudo pfctl -ef pf-block-out.conf — from Terminal. Similarly you can add or remove entries to the table w/o need to re-load the ruleset:\n$ sudo pfctl -t toBlockOut -T show\n   0.1.2.3\n$ sudo pfctl -t toBlockOut -T del 0.1.2.3\n1/1 addresses deleted.\n", "Q: Is there any possibilty to choose a next song on Spotify when the app is minimalized? is there any kind of a shortcut to choose a next song while the app is minimalized?

For some unknown reason locate was not working. To solve the issue, it helped the classical \"have you tried to turn it on and off?\" After restart, it worked.\nAs already mentioned, locate is configured to update its database every Saturday, so it doesn't find any new file created before it updates.

In this case, you want to find a maximum among a range. In excel this is secretly doing two things: first, finding which cells happen to equal 2015 and picking those out. Then, find their maximum. To get the values for the Gas Reading when the year is 2015, you create a vector or \"array\" of values that are only the Gas Readings you want. This is the output of an if statement:\nIF(B:B=F6,C:C)\nwhich has the effect of looking at each entry of the B column, asking if it's equal to F6. If so, then return the corresponding element of the C column. Notice that it spits out a bunch of numbers not just one, so you can't just enter that expression above and see all the numbers. It's not a \"function\" (with one output).\nYou want the maximum of these numbers, minus the minimum of the same numbers, to get the amount of gas you used.\nTherefore the function you seek is \n=MAZ(IF(B:B=F6,C:C))-MIN(IF(B:B=F6,C:C))\nCaveat!! Make sure to use control-shift-return. After you enter the formula, while your cursor is still in the function box, press \"control-shift-return\" rather than just return. This allows excel to deal with the array, i.e. all those values inside the max() function, all at once.\n", "Q: Remote Management Port 5900 Not Responding I am trying to understand why Remote Management (vnc) is not working on my iMac.

I am trying to install Windows 10 in EFI mode on a Mac Pro 5.1, to co-exist with Snow Leopard, also installed in EFI mode, in GPT partitions, and Windows XP, installed in BIOS mode, in an MBR partition.\nSo I set up hybrid partitions, using Gdisk, with 4 MBR partitions at the beginning of the disk (for some reason, the Windows XP installation will fail if the 4 MBR partitions are at the end of the disk, and for some other reason it needs to be on the 4th, but those are different issues).\nGdisk reports:\n\nEverything looks OK to me.\nBut the EFI Boot Windows 10 installation doesn't see the GPT partitions, it only sees the MBR partitions and sees the GPT part of the disk as unallocated space:\n\nAnd says: \"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks.\"\nIf there are no hybrid partitions, Windows 10 installs OK in EFI mode.\nIs Windows 10 installation in EFI mode incompatible with hybrid partitions?\nHas anyone encountered this or found a solution?\n\nA: A Windows 10 installation in EFI mode is incompatible with hybrid partitions. A solution would be to install both Windows XP and Windows 10 in BIOS mode. \n", "Q: Apple Mail Mailboxes missing Apple Mail crashed and I rebuilt the database.

My system:\n  System Version: macOS 10.13.6 (17G5019)\n  Kernel Version: Darwin 17.7.0\n  Boot Volume: Macintosh HD\n  Boot Mode: Normal\n  Model Name: MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier: MacBookPro14,3\n  Processor Name: Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed: 2.9 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores: 4\n  L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 8 MB\n  Memory: 16 GB\n  Boot ROM Version: 185.0.0.0.0\n  SMC Version (system): 2.45f0\n\nWith alarmingly increasing frequency, when I shutdown my Mac at the end of the work day, it hangs. This means that I have to stop it by keeping the Touch ID button pressed - with the result that when I turn my Mac on again, OSX complains about the forced shutdown. I'm worried this may compromise the stability of my system, and maybe even the life of my Mac. \nThis is a company machine, so probably the best thing to do would be to log a case for IT and wait for them to solve the issue. However, I'm on a long business trip and I likely won't be able to give them my laptop before the end of the month. Is there anything I can do on my side, to reduce the risk of instabilities/life reduction?\n\nA: Often, hard drives that won't unmount, or network shares that can't unmount will prevent your system from shutting down completely. \nRight before you shutdown, check the contents of /Volumes and see if there is anything unexpected in there.\n", "Q: Why does TimeMachine generate large backups and is there a way to optimize them? I have 2 Macs:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015), 128 GB  10.14.2 (18C54)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2009), 512 GB  El Capitan (I think)\n\nBoth of them make backups to the same Time Machine (set up on a local NAS).\nMy issue is that MacBook Air generates large backups almost every time it connects to Time Machine - by \"large\" I mean over 1 GB, often several GB.\nThis seems unusual to me because, to my knowledge, I don't generate large files or large number of changes on it - I use it for general office work: typically email, calendar, some work with MS Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), browsing.\nThe other Mac (MBP) is used for similar tasks, maybe a little less intensively and it backs up more frequently (typically every day vs. every couple of days) but it generates significantly smaller backups, at least by order of magnitude.\nThe other difference between those 2 Macs that may play a role is the macOS,  but both of them have highest version of the system available for given hardware.\nHow I can reduce the size of backups generated by my MacBook Air? If  this is more or less normal behavior, please let me know as well.\n\nA: This utility can show you what has been included in the last backup: BackupLoupe\nIf some things are being backed up that don't ever need to be, then you can add them to the exclusions list in the Time Machine Preferences section when you click the [Options] button.\n\nA: Do you backup your iPhone or iPad to your Mac? You can check in iTunes > Preferences > Devices to see if backups are being stored.\nTime Machine generally does exactly what is needed, and attempts to modify its behaviour (beyond merely excluding items from the backup) don't end well. It also 'thins' backups after a while, so it may recover space that had previously been used.\nUsual recommendations are that the backup volume should be 2 or 3 times the size of the source volume.\n\nA: Two possible, partial solutions are:\n\n*\n\n*Identify a program that might be active and updating many files regularly. For example, one user found that closing Mail resulted in much smaller incremental backups: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/time-machine-every-backup-is-large.2098629/post-25667386\n\n*Change the schedule of backups. For example, you could backup every three hours instead of every hour. This does not address why the backups are so large but does reduce the burden of constant long backups. A simple, free solution to adjusting the schedule is TimeMachineEditor. See: https://tclementdev.com/timemachineeditor/\n", "Q: How do I get readable system information at the command line?

Currently I use\n$ system_profiler > foo.txt\n\nand then I search into foo.txt for the information I need. However, the process is incredibly slow, and not very automatic. Is there a better way? I only need OS, SDD/RAM & chipset info - I couldn't care less about sound or Firewalls, for example. \n\nA: You can check data types by listing them with system_profiler -listDataTypes and then use them to get specific info. For example to get info about chipset & RAM run system_profiler SPHardwareDataType.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2018 ventilation slots blocked I bought my MacBook Pro in October 2018. Now, on both the left and the right side of the machine's backside (the bottom) both the ventilation slots show some kind of foil coming out. The foil is coming out of the vents exactly symmetrically and it's slowly getting worse. Now about 4cm of foil are visible on each side.\nI went to a premium reseller and they said they rarely see this and they said it might be the battery coming out which is unsettling. \nI do perform calculations for my university course so R or Python might run for a while but I don't think this would cause harm to the laptop to this extent.\nHas anybody else had this issue? \n\n\nA: Apple had to replace the entire bottom plate (within warranty) of the MacBook. The foil is not related to the battery but rather a sort of inner lining that runs along the sides. The people at genius bar couldn't state any apparent reason for this happening.\n", "Q: brand new iPhone XS seems to run out of juice quite quickly - when should I charge it? I've been using a company iPhone for quite some time now, and I found it to be much better than my Android personal phone, so I decided to buy a 256 Gb iPhone XS. I like it much better than my Samsung, except for the battery - even if it's brand new, it runs out of juice pretty quickly (it may also be that I'm so happy with my purchase, that I end up overusing it - the UX is much better :-) What's the recommended routine for an iPhone? Should I charge it as soon as battery gets down to 20%? Sooner? Later?\n\nA: Apple has a guide on how to maximize the performance of your battery.\nHere are some of the key points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Avoid extreme temperatures\n\n*Remove certain cases during charging(may cause excessive heat)\n\n*Store the device half-charged when storing long-term without usage\n\n*You may also want to check battery settings for what apps are using your battery and maybe disable background app refresh/location services for those apps\n\n*Make sure your display brightness isn't too high and enable auto-brightness if you want\n\n\nAdditional tip(not included in article): Keeping your device between 20%-80% helps your battery last longer. The website says keeping your device up to date also helps, but in many cases updating older devices reduces battery life.(the one exception to this is iOS 12 which actually improved performance and battery life)\n\nA: My personal answer: Charge whenever you can!\nLithium ion batteries basically age based on the pace at which you use them. Whenever the battery goes down, then back up, whether it's 10% or 90%, it ages the amount it went up and down. So it shouldn't matter if you drain it 10% or 50% before charging, any time you're actually using your phone, it is draining and aging the battery.\nSo: Basically just charge it whenever you have a chance so that you are keeping it as full as possible. This will be convenient for you and shouldn't have any effect on the battery compared to letting it get really low before filling it again.\nWhat about leaving it plugged in?\nI honestly don't know anymore. Logically, the facts above about lithium ion batteries imply that keeping it plugged in is the best solution, since it isn't going up and down, just staying at 100%, but I'm not sure if this is practically true or not. Apple makes no mention of whether to keep it plugged in or not in the document linked below, which is annoying, since IMHO it's the biggest question there is.\nI personally try to plug it in whenever I can, but for practical reasons I rarely keep it plugged in while using it, which is the main time it's draining anyway.\nThe answers on this older question on AskDifferent about \"overcharging\" imply that there's no reason to think leaving it plugged in is bad for the phone, but there's not much hard evidence there.\nI think the most important thing to keep in mind is: Don't keep it plugged in if what you're doing is making it hot. Heat is the biggest enemy of battery performance in short and long term (as described below), so mixing charging which heats up the phone with intense activities that heat up the phone (e.g. gaming) is probably a bad solution.\nLeave the screen off unless you need it.\nRemember that the screen is the biggest drain on the battery. It can do non-screen things all day, but any time the OLED is lit up the battery is draining like crazy, so if you find yourself staring at the podcasts app, opening the phone just to admire it's beauty etc. then stop doing that and your battery will last longer each day (and stay more full over the years, since anything that avoids the battery going down in the short term also inherently makes stronger in the long term).\nApple's answer: Vague!\nApple has a detailed article that covers this in detail, here's some quotes:\n\nMaximizing Battery Life and Lifespan\n“Battery life” is the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged. “Battery lifespan” is the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced. Maximize both and you’ll get the most out of your Apple devices, no matter which ones you own.\n...\nYour device is designed to perform well in a wide range of ambient temperatures, with 62° to 72° F (16° to 22° C) as the ideal comfort zone. It’s especially important to avoid exposing your device to ambient temperatures higher than 95° F (35° C), which can permanently damage battery capacity. That is, your battery won’t power your device as long on a given charge. Charging the device in high ambient temperatures can damage it further.\n...\niPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch work best at 32° to 95° F (0° to 35° C) ambient temperatures. Storage temperature: -4° to 113° F (-20° to 45° C).\n\nBrightness settings are something to consider:\n\nThere are two simple ways you can preserve battery life — no matter how you use your device: adjust your screen brightness and use Wi-Fi.\nDim the screen or turn on Auto-Brightness to extend battery life.\n\n*\n\n*To dim, open Control Center and drag the Brightness slider to the bottom.\n\n*Auto-Brightness adjusts your screen to lighting conditions automatically. To activate it, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations and set Auto-Brightness to On.\n\nWhen you use your device to access data, a Wi-Fi connection uses less power than a cellular network — so keep Wi-Fi on at all times. To turn on Wi-Fi, go to Settings > Wi-Fi to access a Wi-Fi network.\n\nRemember to engage low power mode when it you forget and it gets really low!\n\nEnable Low Power Mode.\nIntroduced with iOS 9, Low Power Mode is an easy way to extend the battery life of your iPhone when it starts to get low. Your iPhone lets you know when your battery level goes down to 20%, and again at 10%, and lets you turn on Low Power Mode with one tap. Or you can enable it by going to Settings > Battery. Low Power Mode reduces display brightness, optimizes device performance, and minimizes system animations.\n\n", "Q: Mac Appstore (on Mojave) issues When I type my email and password and then click the login button, after a few seconds I am returned to the login button and not logged in.

I only want to see things I've actually paid for.\nIs this possible?\nNote - I do not want to have to browse through my purchase history... I'd like to just install an app, or whatever I need to do to get a csv or spreadsheet of my purchases. It'd be nice if it included iTunes movie rentals as well ;-) Thanks!\n\nA: Ok.  It can be done, but the way that I've discovered isn't easy.\nI did try to get the info by intercepting iOS app store traffic but the data I got wasn't very clear.  Instead I intercepted traffic from an older version of iTunes that still has app store functionality in it.\nOnce you've fired up your fiddler (requires some setup to decode HTTPS traffic) or whatever intercepting proxy you're going to use, open the older version of iTunes you installed and navigate through the menu Account -> Purchased and then click Apps in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nIn your proxy monitor look for a request that starts with:\nhttps://client-api.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStorePlatform.woa/wa/lookup?id=\n\nThere may be more than one of these requests, so make sure you grab the responses for all of them.  The response is issued in JSON format.  Luckily that JSON contains the data you're looking for...\n\nFiltering JSON is beyond the scope of my answer right now.  It's getting late.  You might have an easier time using grep on some formatted JSON?  I'll see if I can give you the rest tomorrow.\n", "Q: How can I update an iOS device using iTunes on Mac without backing it up?

I'm trying to connect a thermal printer to my iPhone but its not showing up in the list of Bluetooth devices. However, it is showing on my PC and Android smartphone. Has the advertising only got certain compatibility? The Bluetooth thermal printer is a DPP-350 from Datecs. I am using an iPhone 5s and have also tried an iPhone 7 but neither of these phones can see the Bluetooth device being advertised.\n\nA: The thermal printer is not an AirPrint device - as such you cannot use it as a generic printer throughout the iOS system. I.e. this doesn't work like your regular inkjet or laser printer for desktop usage.\nInstead the printer connects via Bluetooth and presents a \"virtual serial port\" to that is available to application developers. This means that the specific app you want to print for must be created to specifically support the DPP-350, or at least this particular type of printer language. \nThis means that you need to find an app that specifically supports this printer before you can have any hope of printing with it from an iPhone.\nIn terms of printer language, this printer does not use AirPrint, PCL, PostScript or similar that would be typical of a normal printer. Instead it uses the old Epson ESC/P printing language, which were used for ordinary printers back in the day (i.e. in the 80s for example). Today it is only really used for smaller receipt printers and the like. They have relatively limited printing capabilities.\n", "Q: How to draw a mathematical graph on mac I want to draw two plots\n\n\n*\n\n*at x=1, y=3, at x=2, y=9\n\n*change the above plot so that y=exp(y), x is unchanged.\n\n\nI know this might seem silly to ask, but I do not have any experience to draw a mathematical plot. Is there any built-in app to do so? I'd be very appreciated for your help.\n\nA: Note:   Plotting just 2 points will give you a straight line only. To see any curvature in a date set, you must plot more than 2 points and the x values must span the proper region.\nI think Excel, Numbers or Google Sheets would be your best bet. You can define an x range of values in one column and then calculate the y values. Both Excel and Numbers have charting/plotting capabilities. Be sure to select \"scatter plot\" as your choice for chart type. You can then plot the x and y data you generated. You can choose bar chart if that is what you want. Below is an image of your result using Google Sheets. If you change the x, y or y2 values the chart will update to reflect the new values. The image won't update though.\n\nThere are other plotting apps for the Mac. The Mac comes with Grapher which is good for charting functions. There is also Magic Plot, and Veusz.  These are probably overkill for what you want which is why I recommended a spreadsheet package.\n", "Q: Why is my Siri getting activated in between conversation Recently Siri on my iPhone 7 latest iOS is getting activated, if I am speaking loudly e.g calling someone from first floor. It usually get activated when I call my son or my wife. This is creepy and I have privacy concern.Why is it happening and What should I do \n\nA: Siri on Apple products is programmed into the local code and hardware. If that code thinks it hears the key phrase, it will activate. If the vibrations local to the microphone are close enough to what you trained when you said hey Siri, it triggers. \nI would set up Hey Siri again one time and then consider deactivating it if you can’t eliminate the false positives.\nThe Hey Siri function is optional and easily disabled if you don’t like and/or trust and/or understand how it’s implemented on the device. \nTap into the Settings app for Siri & Search and toggle the Listen for “Hey Siri” function off. \n\nGood call on not automating something you don’t want and thinking about privacy. Even if the initial “Hey Siri” happens at some point and is processed on the device, the next verbal commands the microphone (mis)interprets might not necessarily be so safe or stay on the device. \n", "Q: How to stop macOS from asking if I want to set a default browser?

I have attempted to use this AppleScript to to cause the Desktop wallpaper to change to the next image in the folder of images that has been selected in System Preferences. It does not work for me in Mojave, the current Desktop wallpaper remains unchanged.\nSince I am unfamiliar with AppleScript, it might be that I am doing something wrong.

I don't want to manually add everything back to a new system to find the issue. \nAny help would be hugely appreciated! \n\nA: The fact that Safe Mode works suggests that the old drivers for your external audio interface are no longer compatible with the newer OS. Check on the manufacturer's website for a new version, and/or follow any instructions for uninstalling the old driver.\nSome audio interfaces are \"CoreAudio compliant\" and can actually work fine without any additional drivers to those built-in to MacOS. After you've removed the old drivers, it's worth seeing if it will work without installing new ones.\n\nA: After trying both of the replies the audio driver is working, looked to be a possible combination of both .kext and extension. \nSadly I am not 100% certain to which made it work in the end, I searched the terminal for the kext as suggested, then opened console to see if there were any issues when plugging in the device.

If you're directed to reinstall iTunes by AppleCare, an article, or an alert dialog, you can do so by following the steps below.\n\nAfterwards, install the software from the Microsoft Software.\n\nA: I must say that my problem was solved with reinstalling the Windows 10. It looks there was a corruption in the Windows Installer service that could only have been fixed with reinstall.\n1) First I tried if I can install the iCloud with the default Administrator account:\n\nOpen Start\nType: cmd\n*Click Run as administrator\nAt the command prompt type: net user administrator /active:yes\nClose command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account. \nTry running the file again.\n\n2) Next thing that I tried was:\n\nPress Windows key + R\nType: regedit\nHit Enter \n\nNavigate to the registry path: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\nTemporarily modify these 3 registry keys: \n\nCurrentBuild set value to 17134 (instead of 17763) \nCurrentBuildNumber set value to 17134 (instead of 17763) \nReleaseId set value to 1803 (instead of 1809) \n\nInstall iCloud: iCloudSetup.exe. When finished, do not restart yet. Restore initial values of the 3 keys (step 3). Restart PC and complete setup of iCloud \nFor Windows 10 in 32-bit version, the path is: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Also you should check if you have Windows 10 in S mode installed.\n  \n\nLast thing I have tried before reinstalling the OS was uninstalling all Apple Software this includes iTunes, Apple Support software etc. Please uninstall them in the following order (as stated in this article)\n\n1) iTunes\n2) Apple Software Update\n3) Apple Mobile Device Support\n4) Bonjour\n5) Apple Application Support 32-bit\n6) Apple Application Support 64-bit\n\nUse Revouninstaller (HOW TO?) to thoroughly remove all Apple Software. Also make sure you uninstall the Apple Software Updater too. Try installing iCloud and iTunes again.\nAnd if you fail after all of this try reinstalling your Windows 10 because that solved my issue with iCloud.\nHopefully this helped for those who have the same issue that I had.\nNOTE: This steps were taken with previously consultation with an Independent Advisor on the Microsoft Community Forum.\n", "Q: Identify macOS Menu bar app - forking arrows icon I follow some videos on macOS and notice this app icon in the Menu bar.\n\nI am curious to learn more about the app and what purpose it serves.

I used it with an external USB 3.0 HD and upgraded the OS each new version up to Sierra, but could never get High Sierra to install.\nNow I've just bought a cheap external USB 3.0 SSD to get a speed boost and I've installed a fresh OS via the Internet Recovery. It only allowed me to install Mountain Lion, which I guess was the current OS when the MBA was new.\nI've gone to the App store to update to Mojave, the only version they seem to offer. I download and ran the update and when it's time to choose the drive to install on, my new SSD, it told me \"You may not install to this volume because the computer is missing a firmware partition.\"\nOne website said to install the firmware update from Apple's support site, but running it tells me I'm already up to date.\nSome websites make it look like the only ways to solve similar problems requires the OEM SSD, which I have no access to.\nI would prefer to have the latest OS but I'd settle for Sierra if it's utterly impossible to install anything newer.

Then upgrade to High Sierra, which will update the Mac's firmware. Then re-install the OWC drive, and upgrade that to High Sierra.\"\nSo any system update that includes an EFI Firmware update will throw this error if you do not have an internal drive.\nIt looks like you will need to get a replacement SSD module for this Mac, which ultimately, is a better solution than running from an external.\n", "Q: iCloud photo library - Lost locations I must mention that I've contacted Apple support many many times about that, there were a bunch of call back from them and email conversations with senior advisors, but there was no success in finding a solution for this issue.\nWhat they've told me in our final conversation over the phone was: \"The engineers are working on this issue and we have couple of reports with the same issue as you do so you must wait till they find a solution\".\nThe reason I'm opening this discussion is to see if there is somebody else with the same issue as mine or anybody has successfully resolved it.\nNow let begin with the explanation of the issue.\nI can see no locations in YEARS, while in COLLECTION and MOMENTS there are locations visible.

All users have such an image even if they are the generic gray silhouette image.\nFurthermore, when you enable network users to log into your mac, and have the login screen configured to show a list of users, the User Pic that accompanies the 'Other...' user is a special login picture, which is a gray silhouette of three individuals, like so:\n\nI would like to change this image so that I can have a more fun picture for the students in my school to click on when they want to login with their network account.  I do not know how to do this.\nOne idea I had, and it was admittedly something of a brute force idea, was to find that image on the hard drive and replace it with a picture of my choice.  The image seems to be this one:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Content/Resources/Everyone.icns\n\nHowever, overwriting that file with a normal image had no effect on the login screen, so I am thinking that either, 1. that isn't really the file being used, or 2. it is the correct file but something else needs to change in addition to over writing it with a different image.\nTo clarify: I am solid on changing the user picture for normal users and I have a script in place already to do so.

It is the 'Everyone' image, or the gray silhouette of three heads, that accompanies the 'Other...' prompt on the login screen that I would like to change.\nThe \"Bounty Goal\" is to replace the 'everyone' image on the login screen with one of my choosing.

I booted into PartedMagic (with the ultimate Boot CD) and tried to see what's on the HDD.\nI can see three partitions:\n1: 200MiB fat32; labeled \"EFI\"\n2: 465GiB \"unknown\", labeled \"Customer\" \n3: 620MiB hfs+ Recocery_HD\nAs far as my understanding goes, the user partition should be hfs+ also; when I try to manually mount it (mount -t hfs plus /dev/......)

In other words GPARTED will work with HFS+ partitions (create, modify, delete, etc.) but I am unsure that it supports mounting an HFS+ filesystem.\nThe Ultimate Boot CD Wiki has no listings when searching for \"HFS.\" Literally nothing comes up. So either their search function is completely messed up or that CD does not offer HFS+ file system support. \nAnd if trying to mount that file system fails with an error it seems likely that there is no HFS+ support on that CD.\nDepending on how Linux knowledgeable you are there are HFS+ filesystem implementations available for Linux that you may be able to install on the Ultimate Boot CD but tht would be outside my area of expertise and outside the remit of AskDifferent.

I have been trying to uninstall the Trend Micro anti-virus software on my Mac (10.13.6) and have been encountering a lot of difficulty. Trend Micro's website refers to a couple of uninstaller options, but none of those are anywhere to be found on my computer.\nThere's a fairly technical (i.e., using terminal) instruction set by Trend Micro here, but I keep having trouble with it. At one point it tells you to remove the directory /Library/Application Support/TrendMicro, but I get \"Permission denied\" even when I attempt to remove it using sudo!\nWhat do I need to do to permanently remove Trend Micro Security Agent from my computer?\n\nA: here, i made a bash script version of what @Erdős-Bacon and @IconDaemon cobbled together above (easier copy-pasta—also, before running, become a superuser, i.e. run su, and after you're done, exit superuser mode by running exit):\n# grab all process IDs (PIDs) associated with Trend Micro\npids=$(ps -A | grep iCoreService | ag -o '\\d{3,4}(?=\\s[\\?t])')\n\n# build array of all files associated with Trend Micro\ntrend_micro_files=(\\\n  '/System/Library/TrendMicro' \\\n  '/Library/StartupItems/iCoreService' \\\n  '/Applications/MainUI.app' \\\n  '/Library/Application Support/TrendMicro' \\\n  '/Library/Frameworks/TMAppCommon.framework/' \\\n  '/Library/Frameworks/TMAppCore.framework/' \\\n  '/Library/Frameworks/TMGUIUtil.framework/' \\\n  '/Library/Frameworks/iCoreClient.framework/' \\\n  '/Library/Frameworks/iCoreClientPb.framework/' \\\n)\n\n# loop through all Trend Micro processes and KILL THEM ALL\nfor pid in ${pids[@]}; do\n  sudo kill $pid\ndone;\n\n# loop through all Trend Micro files and REMOVE THEM ALL\nfor f in ${trend_micro_files[@]}; do\n  sudo rm -rf $f\ndone;\n\n# remove the launchers for Trend Micro (so it doesn't come back on restart)\nlaunchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.icore.av.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.*\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.trendmicro.*\n\n\nA: I just did this myself, here's what I learned while doing it.\nA lot of the difficulty in uninstalling Trend Micro comes from the fact that it spawns processes that then interfere with removing it (this actually makes sense for an anti-virus, but it certainly makes it a challenge when we need to remove it by hand). Basically, we're going to take this in two major moves: 1) killing those interfering processes, 2) deleting all the files associated with Trend Micro.\nYou're going to need to do this through the Terminal program. If you've never used Terminal before, be careful -- nothing below should harm anything (other than the Trend Micro anti-virus), but it's a very powerful tool, and you can really mess stuff up if you aren't careful. You can find it at Applications/Utilities/Terminal.\nAdditionally, you will need to be an admin on your computer. If you do not have admin privileges, the below guide will not work.\nFinally, it would probably be a good idea to make a back-up before starting, just in case something goes wrong.\nKilling Interfering Processes\nFirst, we need to knock out the processes that interfere with deleting Trend Micro. According to the uninstall guide from TrendMicro there are three main processes we want to kill (As a side note, it's a little unnerving that the names Trend Micro uses are so generic. It makes you worried they actually belong to something you want to keep):\n\n\n*\n\n*iCoreService\n\n*TmLoginMgr\n\n*MainUI\nYou can use the command killall to kill processes that match by name, but I prefer to find the PID (Process ID number) associated with what I need to knock out, then issue kill commands for those PIDs. We can find the associated PIDs for each thing listed above with a command of this form:\nps -A | grep iCoreService\n\nWhen you enter that command*, it will return a list off all processes that have iCoreService somewhere in their name. Each process will have a number at the very front: that is the PID. Take note of those numbers. (Note: Your grep command will be one of the processes that gets returned -- you can ignore that, but nothing bad will happen if you try to kill it either.)\n*: If you're wary of people telling you to enter random terminal commands, good for you! Here's what each part does: \"ps -A\" lists all processes currently running; \"|\" pipes that into the next command (in other words, that info is passed along to the next part); \"grep\" searches for matches to whatever it is given, in this case 'iCoreService'. In total, we're pulling out all those processes that have 'iCoreService' in the name.\nNow we're going to kill each of those processes. Use this command, running it for each PID you just found:\nkill NUMBER_GOES_HERE\n\n(E.g., you would write something like kill 1253, but using the numbers that came up from the previous command.)\nAt this point, it should tell you that you don't have the permissions to do that -- you need to prove that you really are an admin and should be allowed. Issue that same command, but now with sudo in front:\nsudo kill NUMBER_GOES_HERE\n\nThe terminal will prompt you for your password. Type it in, hit enter, and that's it, the process should be gone now.\nWhat's going on with this command? \"sudo\" means Super User Do, basically forcing the computer to do what you want because you're the admin; \"kill\" issues a signal to terminate the process with whatever PID number you pass in after.\nWhen I did this, I got a total of 4 processes associated with iCoreService. After you've knocked that one out, remember that you'll also need to do it for TmLoginMgr (I got 1 process here) and for MainUI (I had 0 processes here, but it's possible that was due to a previous removal attempt by someone else.)\nGreat! Now that the boss' shields are down, we can attack!\nDeleting Trend Micro Files\nNow it's time to actually delete the files associated with the anti-virus.\nHere's the list of directories (folders) we want to delete:\n/System/Library/TrendMicro\n/Library/StartupItems/iCoreService\n/Applications/MainUI.app\n/Library/Application Support/TrendMicro\n/Library/Frameworks/TMAppCommon.framework/\n/Library/Frameworks/TMAppCore.framework/\n/Library/Frameworks/TMGUIUtil.framework/\n/Library/Frameworks/iCoreClient.framework/\n/Library/Frameworks/iCoreClientPb.framework/\n\n[Note: When I did this, I was not able to find every single folder. It's possible some were gone due to a previous removal attempt by someone else. Could also be due to those Trend Micro uninstall docs being more than four years old... The specific folders I could not find were the first three in the list above. But if they exist on your installation, you should still remove them.]\nTo delete each of these, use this command:\nrm -rf \"FULL_PATH_IN_QUOTES_GOES_HERE\"\n\nIn other words, you should copy each line from the above list and execute like this:\nrm -rf \"/Library/Application Support/TrendMicro\". (The quotes are really important for the folder with 'Application Support' in its path because of the space, other directories don't need it, but it doesn't hurt to follow that pattern for each one.) Some of the folders might not exist, that's okay.\nMore than any other command, this is the one you need to be very careful with. \"rm\" is the command to remove (delete) things; \"-rf\" tells it to delete folders and to recurse downward (delete folders within folders and so on downward); the double-quotes ensure that paths with a space still get deleted correctly.\nLike before, you will probably be told that you do not have the appropriate permissions to do that. You'll need to elevate with sudo as we did before:\nsudo rm -rf \"FULL_PATH_IN_QUOTES_GOES_HERE\"\n\nDo that for each of the directories in the list of Trend Micro folders to remove.\nNote: I had a lot of difficulty trying to remove /Library/Application Support/TrendMicro. Even with sudo, I still got \"Permission denied\". Luckily, I happened to double-check that all the processes from part 1 were still dead (another ps -A | grep iCoreService): nope, iCoreService had come back. I played kill whack-a-mole with it a couple more times, killing its new PIDs, then tried to very quickly issue the rm -rf \"/Library/Application Support/TrendMicro\" command after having killed all those processes and eventually got it to work. I think something was respawning those processes, so it was a matter of timing to knock them out and delete those files before they came back. (Once that directory was gone, they never came back.)\nFinally, we can now remove the \"Trend Micro Security Agent\" app from our Applications folder. You can go do that in the finder (navigate to it in finder, right-click, move to trash [it will prompt for password]) or you can do it via the Terminal if you're comfortable with that.\nBonus: Removing Start-Up Processes\nAt this point, we've deleted pretty much everything from the Trend Micro anti-virus, but there's still some start-up stuff that we ought to go tear out. Run this:\nlaunchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.icore.av.plist\n\n\"launchctl\" is a utility for interacting with 'launchd', a utility that manages other processes; \"unload\" tells 'launchctl' to disable processes associated with whatever you pass it next; the \"/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.icore.av.plist\" is the thing you're unloading.\nNow delete the launchdaemon and launchagent files which invoke the processes associated with Trend Micro at boot time:\nrm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.*\nrm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.trendmicro.*\n\n\"rm\" is the same remove (delete) command as before; \"/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.*\" tells it to delete all files in that path with that starting structure, the * means anything that matches up to that point will get deleted.\n[Note: It's possible this should happen earlier in the steps. I'm not sure what caused the iCoreService processes to come back, if I had done the unloading earlier it might have made the actual deletion in part 2 more direct with no need to re-issue kills on iCoreService processes. If you try it that way and it works better, please leave a comment!]\nAnd We're Done!\nWhew! At this point, Trend Micro should be fully uninstalled. Reboot your computer to make sure everything is still working fine and that Trend Micro really is gone.\nOther Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*This was basically cobbled together from the Trend Micro guide linked near the top and this other uninstall script I found.\n\n*The uninstall guide from Trend Micro says to run /Library/Application\\ Support/TrendMicro/TmccMac/TmLoginMgr.app/Contents/MacOS/TmLoginMgr -u, but when I did that I got this \"LoginItem(/Library/Application Support/TrendMicro/TmccMac/TmLoginMgr.app) has already been removed\": it could have been from a previous person's attempt to remove Trend Micro, but it also could have been something else. You might want to include it when you try to uninstall, just in case, but it also might be pointless.\n\n*I actually took on root user (using sudo su) to do a lot of this when I got stuck trying to remove /Library/Application Support/TrendMicro. In retrospect, I don't think that was actually necessary, it was just due to those iCoreService child processes blocking things, but if you have trouble, give that a shot.\n\n*I included removing /Library/Frameworks/iCoreClientPb.framework/, but it was not referenced in either uninstall guide I linked. I'm almost certain it's part of Trend Micro, but caveat lector.\n\nA: Thank you Erdős-Bacon for doing that work! Your hunch is correct that your problems with processes coming back were because the launch daemons had not been unloaded. I took your work and changed the order around, resulting in a shorter script (must be run with sudo):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nlaunchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.* /Library/LaunchAgents/com.trendmicro.*\n\nrm -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.trendmicro.* /Library/LaunchAgents/com.trendmicro.* \\\n  /System/Library/TrendMicro /Library/StartupItems/iCoreService /Applications/MainUI.app \\\n  /Library/Application\\ Support/TrendMicro /Library/Frameworks/TMAppCommon.framework/ \\\n  /Library/Frameworks/TMAppCore.framework/ /Library/Frameworks/TMGUIUtil.framework/ \\\n  /Library/Frameworks/iCoreClient.framework/ /Library/Frameworks/iCoreClientPb.framework/\n\nAlso I did not get your errors about missing directories when I deleted; so I assume that they were missing because the prior failed run of TM's uninstaller had deleted them, as you suspected. \nI do note that the menu bar item is still there until after a reboot. I'm not sure if there's a way to kill that without rebooting.

Could you help me find some?\n\nA: The Boot Camp drivers for (really) old iMacs is included on the OS X Snow Leopard installation DVD. This DVD can still be purchased from Apple. Since Snow Leopard was released in 2009, the DVD should contain the XP drives for your 2006 Mac.\nSince OS X Leopard was released on DVD in late 2007, the Boot Camp drivers on this DVD should also work with a XP installation on your Mac. \nApple does have a Boot Camp - Windows XP Drivers Update 2.1 website which states the following:\n\nNote: This download contains complete copies of Boot Camp Windows XP Drivers (version 2.1).  If you have Boot Camp drivers already installed, it will update them.  If you do not have any Boot Camp drivers installed, it will install version 2.1 drivers onto your already installed Windows OS.\n\nSince the Post Date is Apr 24, 2008 and the website mentions OS X Leopard, I would assume the download would contain the drivers for all 2006 Macs that can run Windows XP. The web site has a special note, which is repeated below.\n\nImportant: Installation of Boot Camp 2.1 is required before installing Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3)\n\nThere is also a Boot Camp Drivers Update 2.2 for Windows.

Now rEFInd is working but there's no option for my Kali partition.\nI understand there should be a shortcut with bootloader\\grub conf without Kali reinstall Kali and cloning partition once again (if ever it boots).\nHow do I make this ext4 partition boot (supposing cloning was successful)?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: OK, after searching for 2 days I finally got the answer.\nSo I had a bootable apfs OSX partition with rEFInd installed from OSX. rEFIND couldn't find ext4 partition from OSX natively. That was the problem. ext4 partition was cloned from source later on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Kali live-USB, mount it using dd or rufus or any other software. \n\n*Reboot, Hold alt to boot from Kali USB, then follow the instructons from here https://medium.freecodecamp.org/kali-installation-on-usb-stick-with-pure-efi-boot-on-a-mac-37585b7698e2 section \"Boot from Live GRUB\".\n\n*After you log in (here's the main trick): download a debian version of rEFInd (.deb)\nand install it:\n\n\nsudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE\n\n\n*Reboot. Your Kali partition should appear on rEFInd boot menu together with OSX.\n\n", "Q: Passwords in Chrome I forgot one of my passwords stored in Chrome. When I navigate to the page Chrome offers to auto-fill it in. I need to know the password. I checked Settings, it says \nView and manage saved passwords in your [Google Account][1]\n\n**Saved Passwords**\n*Saved passwords will appear here*\n\n**Never Saved**\n...\n\nI checked https://passwords.google.com and there are indeed passwords listed there, but not the particular one I am looking for. I looked in chrome://flags/ and there is no password export option there (there might have been before). My version is\nVersion 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nIs there any easy way to find this password other than with wireshark?\n\nA: You can inspect the input element for the password and change the input type from password to text. You will notice the password that has been filled in will be visible (changed from ******).\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the password field on the website and click 'Inspect' from the context menu.\n\n*This will open developer tools with the input element selected. It will be something like <input type=\"password\" ..>. Change the type to text and click outside. This will save the change and you will see your password.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Additionally to @abdul's answer, you can use Firefox to import from Chrome and have a backup of the passwords. You can view all your passwords in Firefox as well.\n", "Q: Bootcamp the startup disk cannot be partiitoned I cannot install Bootcamp because it gives me an error message of \"The startup disk cannot be partitioned\".\nThis is the result of diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         121.0 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         1.9 TB     disk1s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data OSXRESERVED             8.0 GB     disk1s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                1.1 TB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +2.0 TB     disk2\n                                 Physical Stores disk0s2, disk1s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            913.9 GB   disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 42.2 MB    disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                517.0 MB   disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      24.6 KB    disk2s4\n\n/dev/disk3 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US... +4.7 GB     disk3\n\n/dev/disk4 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            Boot Camp              +1.2 GB     disk4\n\nand diskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\n\nA: This is a very common question.

I would like to use an external keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc and have my MacBook closed. The only issue is that I can no longer access the fingerprint scanner. Is there a way to use an external one? FYI, I have installed Unlox which is very useful but doesn't cover all cases where a fingerprint can be used.\nYes, I read the similar question but thought this one was different since that one referenced a 10-yr old Macbook that didn't have the Touchbar. And there are ways to solve the problem in that question.\n\nA: No, there's no external fingerprint reader that works like the built-in reader. The built-in reader is not communicating directly with macOS on the main CPU, instead it communicates with a seperate kernel (still Darwin) running on a secondary ARM CPU.\nAs there's no way to connect an external fingerprint reader to the secondary ARM CPU, it is simply not possible for 3rd parties to create something that works exactly like the built-in reader and offers the same functionality.\n"]
