["Q: how can I force a mount -a to run after the system boots up? Media server running Ubuntu 16.04 and Kodi. Synology NAS in the next room contains all the media. \nhow can I get my fstab mounts working if they won't mount on bootup? -- tried switching to username/password instead of .smbcredentials, no change. \nTried adding _netdev, no change. \nI've tried fixing my /etc/fstab and it's just not working. I'm not sure what the problem is, but I cannot get my NAS folders to mount that way. Posted here, posted on ubuntuforums, no go (didn't get any answers in either one). Every time I reboot I have to ssh in to the box to get my media folders back. \nSo, I thought I'd take a different approach. I'm assuming there is some issue with my NAS or network that makes mounting at boot via fstab to not work. I don't know. \nSince I know that my folders will mount with sudo mount -a, how can I run that command at boot time after everything else (network especially) is done? \n\nA: One way to add your command at startup would be to add it as a cron job.\nAdd your command to the root cron by typing in the following line in a terminal window:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nthen at the bottom of the cron add a line that reads like this:\n@reboot /bin/mount -a\n\nor if you want to add a delay of like 10 seconds to it:\n@reboot /bin/bash -c 'sleep 10 && /bin/mount -a'\n\nthat should tell it to run the mount -a command as root at boot up time.\nOr, you could add it to your system wide crontab by editing the following file:\n/etc/crontab\n\nand adding the following line:\n@reboot root /bin/bash -c 'sleep 10 && /bin/mount -a'\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Maybe it's trying to mount your share before the network is ready.\nIn this case, you should add _netdev option in your /etc/fstab.\nExample :\n//server/share /mountpoint  cifs username=xx,password=yy,_netdev 0 0\n\nThis forces the OS to wait for the network to be ready before trying to mount this mountpoint.\n", "Q: Installing NVIDIA proprietary drivers?

Earlier I was given a choice to choose which OS to load via gnu grub. I remember I accidently clicked some buttons (then it went to maybe edit gnu grub or etc., I was trying to swap Windows and Ubuntu's position). Now I no longer can choose which OS to load (it boots directly to Windows), but I found a workaround: When the laptop starts I keep pressing Esc and then I press F9, then I get a choice again but maybe in some BIOS style. Also I can't access Windows files, I get this error (maybe because I stopped Windows' booting in between):\nUnable to access “Windows”\n\nError mounting /dev/sda4 at /media/aditya/Windows: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000\" \"/dev/sda4\" \"/media/aditya/Windows\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda4': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.

Recently i tried a solution i found online and followed the step,and it did work for me. The issue was with the boot order in Boot Manager. I hope this can fix your issue. So here is the link:\nhttp://linuxbsdos.com/2016/11/05/make-grub-the-default-boot-manager-on-an-hp-250-g5/\nThis issue of  \"missing\" grub window was due to the problem in the placement order of OS in the boot manager. Previously, Windows 10 was on the top of the list. Hence it directly booted Windows 10. Now changing the order (by making Ubuntu on the top of the list) will let us access grub window. ( Note: Here fn key is not used whenever Fuctional keys are used)                                                                                                                                          \nHere i've mentioned the steps i followed:1.  Press esc key (for HP Notebook ) for getting the Boot menu .  2.  From the options listed (F1-System Information, F2-System Diagnostics, F9-Boot Device Options, F10-Bios Setup, F11-System Recovery) press F10 for Bios Setup.3.  From the screen you obtain, navigate to \"System Configuration\" using arrow keys and from there move down to \"UEFI Boot Order\". Press Enter key to access sub-options from it. 4. Inside the sub-option, select \"OS Boot Manager\"   and press Enter key to reveal the options inside it ( in my case, the order inside the option was  Windows 10 ,then GRUB)5. Press F5/F6 key to change the order and make GRUB on top of the list. 6. After changing the order, press F10 to save the changes and exit.   Now its good to go! From now on, you may find GRUB window each time you switch on the computer, instead of directly booting to Windows.

I have been following this guide to restore my backup by hand. The steps have been:\nIn the folder containing the backups run:\nfor t in duplicity-full.[yournumbershere].*.difftar.gz; do tar xf $t; done\nThis gave me two folders: multivol_snapshot and snapshot. In the multivol_snapshot folder are all of my files but split up into smaller files. I could join each manually by running cat * > file.txt but this would take a very long time. The page provides a script called  duplicity_join.py which joins them together. However, it doesn't preserve the folder structure and so any files or folders with the same name get overwritten.\nIs there an existing method available for joining the files automatically that preserves the folder structure?\n\nA: Copying the solution from this guide with my modifications:\nOpen a Terminal and navigate to the directory containing your backups. This folder contains all of your files archived into many .gz files. Mine was in a folder called multivol_snapshot. Unpack all the archives with the following command:\nfor t in duplicity-full.[yournumbershere].*.difftar.gz; do tar xf $t; done\nThis might take awhile. I had 138GB of data which took five hours to untar.\nRunning this will give you your files and folders back in the correct structure with one caveat: All of the files are split into smaller pieces. You can join these files back manually easily by running the following command:\ncat * > examplefile.txt\nHowever, if you have thousands of files doing this could take a very long time. David Huss wrote a Python script called duplicity_joiner.py to make this easier. Download it here.\nTo run it, you need python and tk. Install this by running:\nsudo apt-get install python-dev\nsudo apt-get install python-tk\nUsing this script you can select the folder where to restore your files, with one caveat: This script doesn't maintain the folder structure. So, if you have many folders and files with the same name there is a possibility that they will be overwritten.\nI have rewritten the script to address this. It will preserve the folder structure but can result in very long folder paths.

You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt install ghostscript\nzsh: command not found: gs\n\nI've also tried:\nunalias gs\n\nAs explained here:\nHow to remove an alias?\nBut that gives me unalias: no such hash table element: gs.\nHow do I solve this?\n\nA: It sounds like you simply don't have this alias defined. Aliases take precedence over hashed executables like gs, the presence of gs on your system wouldn't affect the alias at all. So, just add this line to your ~/.zshrc:\nalias gs='git status'\n\nSave the file, open a new terminal and you should be all set. \nNow, ghostscript is quite useful and you might want to reinstall it. If you do, you can run it as \\gs or command gs. \n", "Q: How do I install qtox in Ubuntu 16.04?

Hopefully the bug will be fixed soon.\n", "Q: Cannot use CUDA, NVIDIA gpu is not detected, ubuntu 14.04 I have ubuntu 14.04 and nvidia 660m. I have read several similar questions but non of them solved my problem. My problem is that either CUDA does not detect my gpu or I cannot login to ubuntu after reboot. Here's what I've done:\nI used the xorg-edgers ppa to install the drivers via apt.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\nThen I downloaded the same driver version from nvidia website and installed it because I read that I need the nividia's .run file to install cuda. Although it showed me that the pre-installation script failed, I forced it to install. And everything went fine and CUDA detected my gpu. (Without installing nvidia's .run file, CUDA fails to detect my gpu).\nHowever, after rebooting, I could not pass the login screen any more.\nTo resolve it, I followed the instructions in this question (uninstalling the .run file and uninstalling all nvidia drivers and reinstalling via ppa again) and I was able to login. However, now CUDA does not detect my gpu anymore. I tried reinstalling the .run file and the same happens. I can use CUDA just before I reboot and after reboot, I can't login. \nHow can I make CUDA work with NVIDIA?\nThanks\n\nA: No answer about login issue.

I have monitor and laptop screen and have a problem with the \"Show desktop\" function.\nLaptop screen is showing widget that should stay for all the time. Main monitor is used normally.\nWhenever I use keyboard shortcut (windows key + d in my case), all windows will be hidden but I only want to hide all the windows on the specific monitor.\nIs this possible?\nQuestion similar to https://superuser.com/questions/200945/how-can-i-make-the-show-desktop-function-only-hide-the-windows-on-a-specific-m, with notable difference that I ask about different OS.\n\nA: Only minimize windows on one screen\nThe script below can be used to (only) minimize windows on the left screen or only on the right screen.\nThe script is run with either 1 or 2 as argument, depending on which screen you'd like to minimize the windows.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\nscr = sys.argv[1]\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\n# find the right side of the left screen\nedge = [int(s.split(\"x\")[0]) for s in get(\"xrandr\").split() if \"+0+\" in s][0]\n# read the window list\nwlist = [w.split() for w in get([\"wmctrl\", \"-lG\"]).splitlines()]\nfor w in wlist:\n    # retrieve the window id and -position\n    w_id = w[0]; xpos = int(w[2])\n    # check the position of the window, decide action depending on arg.\n    test = xpos < edge if scr == \"1\" else xpos >= edge\n    if test:\n        # check if the window is \"normal\" and / or minimized\n        w_data = get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w_id])\n        if all([not \"_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN\" in w_data,\n                    \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in w_data]):\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowminimize\", w_id])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both wmctrl and xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as min_screen.py\n\n*To run it:\npython3 /path/to/min_screen.py 1\n\nto minimize windows on the left screen, and\npython3 /path/to/min_screen.py 2 \n\nto minimize windows only on the right screen\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*The script assumes python3 is installed, but the code is not python3 specific I believe.\n\n*The script was written on Unity, but unlike workspaces (viewports), handling the screens should not make a difference.\n\n*The script will not minimize windows with pid 0 (Idle or other tkinterwindows for example). If that is an issue, please mention. Can be solved.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe script first looks up the right edge of the left screen, by looking up the string with +0+ in the output of xrandr, looking like: \n1680x1050+0+0\n\nThe first section, 1680, is the widht of the left screen. Subsequently, all we have to do is look into the window list (wmctrl -lG) and see which of the windows is \"below\" or \"above\" 1680, and act accordingly, minimizing with the command xdotool windowminimize <window_id> (or not).\nTh \"test\" finally (mmiz): xprop -id <window_id> is to check if we are dealing with a \"normal\" window (instead of e.g. your desktop, which is also listed as a window), and if the window is already minimized.\nSee also the comment in the script.\nBinding the script to a keyboard shortcut\n1. On Lubuntu\nTo edit global keyboard shortcuts in Lubuntu see Lubuntu minimize all show desktop keyboard shortcut?\nIn this case: save script from this answer into a file on the computer, make this file executable, open /.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml and replace\n  <keybind key=\"W-d\">\n    <action name=\"ToggleShowDesktop\"/>\n  </keybind>\n\nby\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n   <command>/path/to/show_desktop.py 1</command>\n  </action>\n\nwhere /path/to/show_desktop.pyis (of course) the path to the script, and either 1 or 2 the targeted screen. Make the script executable.\nRestart computer to reload config.\n2. Unity/Gnome\nMake the script executable and choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n/path/to/show_desktop.py 1\n\n...to a shortcut of your choice\n\nA: Introduction\nThe script below allows user to click on a display they want, and all windows on that display will be minimized. This script is meant to be bound to a keyboard shortcut, but can run manually if so desired.\nUsage is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*activate the script, your mouse cursor will turn into a cross\n\n*Click on any program window ( but not desktop )  on the display you wish to minimize. \n\n*The script will determine all the windows on that display , and minimize ( iconify ) them.\n\n\nThe program doesn't require any additional packages to be installed. The script has been tested on regular Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  and Lubuntu 16.04 LTS. Thanks to @JourneymanGeek for testing it on Fedora 24 with KDE as well !\nObtaining the script source code\nThe script source code can be obtained by manually copying it here, or by getting it from my github repository. To obtain it via git follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install git\n\n*cd /opt ; sudo git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/sergrep.git\n\n*sudo chmod -R +x sergrep\nThe file will be called minimize_display_windows.py .

See Step 4.\n\n*To remove and reinstall PulseAudio issue: sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install pavucontrol linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils lightdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; sudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils lightdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ubuntu-support-status\n\n*Disconnect all Bluetooth devices.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Reinstall Unity, and Ubuntu Desktop.  See the last of the post I linked in Step 3.  At this point, you should have audio in hardware speakers.\n\n*Enable Unlimited Scrolling in your Terminal:  Start a new terminal, and click Edit > Profiles > \"Default\" profile > Scrolling. Choose \"Unlimited\" as scrolling option. Click Close and Close again.\n\n*Verify or add your user to the following groups using usermod -aG: pulse, audio, pulse-access, pulse-rt, video:\ncat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami\nProvide Information About ALSA and PulseAudio\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the ALSA script: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh.\n\n*Provide information here about ALSA: bash alsa-info.sh --stdout.\n\n*Provide the following information about your devices: cat /proc/asound/{version,cards,devices,hwdep,pcm,seq/clients}; sudo rm /etc/asound.conf; sudo rm -r ~/.pulse ~/.asound* ;sudo rm ~/.pulse-cookie; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install aptitude; sudo aptitude install paman gnome-alsamixer libasound2-plugins padevchooser libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio; sudo lshw -short;ls -lart /dev/snd; find /lib/modules/uname -r| grep snd ;cat /dev/sndstat; lspci -nn; lsusb; sudo which alsactl; sudo fuser -v /dev/dsp /dev/snd/* ; dpkg -S bin/slmodemd; dmesg | egrep 'EMU|probe|emu|ALSA|alsa|ac97|udi|snd|ound|irmware'; sudo /etc/init.d/sl-modem-daemon status; sudo grep model /etc/modprobe.d/* ; sudo dmidecode|egrep 'anufact|roduct|erial|elease'; lsmod | egrep 'snd|usb|midi|udio'; pacmd list-sinks; aplay -l; sudo alsa force-reload;  ubuntu-support-status ; sudo lshw -C sound\n\n*Provide a PulseAudio startup log: sudo gedit /etc/pulse/client.conf.  Add extra-arguments = -vvvv --log-target=newfile:/tmp/pulseverbose.log --log-time=1 to the End of the file.  Reboot && Post the content of the log here.\n\n\nProvide Information on Bluetooth Applications\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-cache policy pulseaudio.\n\n*apt-cache policy bluez.\n\n*apt-cache policy blueman.\n\n*apt-cache policy pulseaudio-module-bluetooth.\n\n*Verify your Ubuntu release: lsb_release -rd\n\n*Post the contents of /etc/pulse/default.pa.\n\n\n\nReferences\nUbuntuWiki - SoundTroubleshootingProcedure\nPulseAudio Bug 1274613 - LaunchPad\nUbuntuWiki - PulseAudio Logging\nUbuntu Forums - (Solved) module-bluetooth-discover not loading on startup \n\nA: I followed this, and it worked even though it wouldn't work multiple times. I think it is because I didn't properly close every program involved (blueman/pulseaudio) before executing the command\n", "Q: Booting ubuntu from USB error Can someone help me?

Then that should help. If you keep getting the error, try switching the port you are plugging the USB in.\nIt also may have to do with what version of ubuntu your installing and supported drivers. But, linux is pretty good about working with everything only needing a few tweaks here or there. So unless your doing an old old old.. release, or using an old... \"ya you get the idea\" .. computer/hardware, then it probably isn't that. more likely reading old data, something got corrupted, or the port doesn't have enough/too much power and is causing an error. \nIf your updating to 16.04 then there is also some sort of error I remember reading about relating to UEFI boot.\nMore information would help for a more direct answer from someone with person experience with that exact problem, like type of PC, native OS, Hardware installed, Version of ubuntu you are trying to install, ext. I have seen the \n6.063360 sd 6:0:0:0: sdd no caching mode page found\n\n6.063440 sd 6:0:0:0: sdd assuming drive cache: write through\n\nerror just last night when I updated to 16.04 to help answer another question. I erased the USB, several times, and retried, It worked out. I also had the same problem with my USB3 port when I was messing around with different ways to run and manipulate windows 7, Too much power or something, switched ports and it fixed it. \nKnow I don't have the perfect answer, but I hope it helps some :)\n", "Q: Amarok 2.8 High Memory Usage in Kubuntu 16.04?

I've been using Unity for as long as I can remember. However, I was open to try something new. I went for the MATE Desktop Environment.\nI installed it using sudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment and to be honest, it didn't look anything like this:\n\nInstead, I got something that looked like some sort of mutation of Windows 98. How can I get MATE to look like it does when installed fresh?\n\nA: I used the good old Unity Tweak Tool, went to Appearance > Theme > Theme, chose Ambiance, and then clicked on Icons and chose ubuntu-mono-dark and my Unity looked like the way it always had again.\nThen, it was time to work on MATE. I installed mate-desktop-environment-extras which installed a few extra things, but can most likely be omitted. I opened Unity Tweak Tool and I tried a few themes. They did not work, which was because this is MATE, not Unity and it uses a different way of theming, or somehting. \nI had more luck with the MATE Control Center, which looked like this...\n\nUntil I found Appearance under Look and Feel.

I know within Firefox there are font options and sizes you can change that aren't controlled by the system unless high contrast colors are used. For Firefox it's found under Preferences> Content and going into \"advanced\" within that page will allow further tweaking. Not sure if it's the same for the others but I would not be surprised.\nI had a similar issue but it was the tabs and menus having tiny fonts. The solution I found (for Kubuntu 16.04 anyway) was in the system settings> fonts> and at the bottom of the page is an option to \"Force fonts DPI:\" with an option to increase or decrease the number (default is 72 or 96). I increased mine up to 168 to get 16pt fonts to look about normal on a screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440.

I plugged in and installation USB once, and it took me to the installation screen, where it installed, however the first time I tried it said I only had 4.1 GB of memory left, (this is a 500 GB laptop,) and the second time it worked, but it just did the same thing when I tried to reboot it. \nAnd I can't force it to boot from USB, because the hot-keys do nothing.

By just typing some commands, how can Ubuntu be uninstalled? I don't want to install Windows or anything, leaving my PC without an OS.\nWould this command work?\nsudo rm -rf /\n\n\nA: Boot into a livecd. take note of the device names of your old system install, and unmount the drives if automounted. I'd use lsblk to check, and umount to unmount.\nRun the shred command on each device. This basically overwrites each partition with zeros, much like dban does. You can then delete the partitions with a suitable tool.\ndd should work, but I prefer shred since its a more precise tool designed to clear data.\nIf its an SSD, you might want to use hdparm to run a sata secure erase command instead.\nrm -rf / is a terrible way to wipe a disk. It risks bricking your system as Suici Doga has suggested. If it dosen't, the data is likely recoverable, and your system may be at a point where you've deleted enough that more cannot be deleted. Its a little like using a hammer to turn a nut. It might work, or you may end up hitting yourself in the head.\n\nA: DO NOT RUN sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root on systems with systemd\nWhen running the command on a UEFI computer (2012 or newer) you are deleting all the UEFI firmware variables which can cause your PC to be bricked and cannot be repaired without a motherboard replacement on some devices.\nHere is what happened to one Linux user : An Ubuntu command bricked my system?\nSo don't try what the other answers talking about rm -rf / say since it only works on legacy BIOS machines. I am typing this from a UEFI laptop which can also be bricked by the command.\n\nProper Method for UEFI devices.\nBoot an Ubuntu Live USB / CD and open GParted. Then delete all the partitions and click apply.\nPlease note that after this, most of your data can still be recovered easily using professional tools.\n\nProper Method for UEFI devices if you have private data\nAs @ByteCommander says, download DBAN (Darik's Boot And Nuke), burn the ISO to a disc / USB and tell it to erase the disk\nAfter performing this, all data is irreversibly gone!\n\nA: If you're on a single drive system attempting to wipe the root drive you should boot from a live media as mentioned by @JourneymanGeek.\nMy preferred method for wiping a drive uses dc3dd.\nIf you don't have it you can install it from the universe repository on a terminal with sudo apt-get install dc3dd.\nYou'll want to determine exactly what drive you are trying to wipe (this is especially important in a multi-drive system).\nYou can find the correct drive using the output of sudo fdisk -l.\nAfter determining that the drive is /dev/sdX or whatever you can issue the command\nsudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX which will overwrite the entire drive with zeros.\nA more secure approach might be to overwrite using a pattern such as sudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX pat=FFEEDD  which will overwrite the drive using a hexadecimal pattern (in this case FFEEDD)\nYou can also use a text pattern to overwrite such as\nsudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX tpat=iloveubuntu which will overwrite the drive using the text string iloveubuntu. \nSources: Experience and Linhost.info (article).\nAnother method of wiping a whole drive consists of using the ATA Secure Erase feature implemented on many newer drives.  This will erase all data on the selected device. Be aware that depending on circumstances (buggy kernel, firmware, or BIOS or using a USB interface) it appears that it's possible to brick the device at least temporarily by locking your self out of it.\nIf I haven't managed to convince you to use the easier solution above continue from here.\n1st insure the drive isn't frozen and secure erase is supported:\nExample from a Samsung HD103SJ I found on my shelf:\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdd | grep -A9 Security:\n\n   Security: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n        supported\n    not enabled\n    not locked\n        frozen\n    not expired: security count\n        supported: enhanced erase\n    150min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 150min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. \nLogical Unit WWN Device Identifier: 50024e92033cfe47\n\nThis drive is frozen and need to be unfrozen in order to continue After trying everything from putting the drive to sleep via Disks unplugging and replugging the data cable I ws finally successful in getting the drive into a not frozen state by unplugging the power to it, waiting for it to spin down and plugging the power back into the drive resulting in :\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n        supported\n    not enabled\n    not locked\n    not frozen\n    not expired: security count\n        supported: enhanced erase\n    150min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 150min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. \nLogical Unit WWN Device Identifier: 50024e92033cfe47\n\nNow we proceed to set a security password so that we can perform the secure erase.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Pass /dev/sdd\nsecurity_password=\"Pass\"\n\n/dev/sdd:\n Issuing SECURITY_SET_PASS command, password=\"Pass\", user=user, mode=high\n\nSince the time for a secure erase of this drive is in excess of 2 hours we had best verify our hdparm version.\n hdparm -V\nhdparm v9.43\n\nWe do this because hdparm versions prior to 9.31 do not pass-through the long command time-outs required for the erase commands to the SCSI-ATA Command Translation (\"SAT\") layer which such devices use. Mine is version 9.43 so I will proceed.\nFirst I'll confirm that the security mode was properly set:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sdd |grep -A9 Security\n       *    Security Mode feature set\n       *    Power Management feature set\n       *    Write cache\n       *    Look-ahead\n       *    Host Protected Area feature set\n       *    WRITE_BUFFER command\n       *    READ_BUFFER command\n       *    NOP cmd\n       *    DOWNLOAD_MICROCODE\n       *    Advanced Power Management feature set\n--\nSecurity: \n    Master password revision code = 65534\n        supported\n        enabled\n    not locked\n    not frozen\n    not expired: security count\n        supported: enhanced erase\n    Security level high\n    150min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 150min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\nYes it is as we can see above. Now I will begin to secure erase the drive and go away for the 2 1/2 hours it will take on this one.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Pass /dev/sdd\n/dev/sdd:\n Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password=\"Pass\", user=user\n\nWhen the process is complete your prompt will simply return.\nA final alternative:\nIf you just want to insure that no data on the drive is retrievable and wish to retire the drive permanently. You can pound it flat with a big hammer (wear eye protection and do this at your own risk) \nSecure Erase Sources:\nhttps://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase\nman hdparm\nhttp://www.overclockers.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-693716.html\n\nA: I guess you want to sell your computer. In that case it would be the best to securely wipe the entire disk to prevent that anybody can recover any of your personal files later.\nThe best tool for this is DBAN (Darik's Boot And Nuke).\nDownload the .iso image and burn it to a CD or flash drive. Then boot your computer from it and let it erase the whole hard disk.\nDepending on the option you chose, the erasure will be more or less secure, but take longer. Unless you have really private data on that disk, a quick pass should be enough.\nPlease note that erasing a hard disk this way will irreversibly destroy all data on it, there's no way it can be recovered. Use with caution!\n\nA: Easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a live CD/USB with GParted.\n\n*Search for your hard drive in GParted (usually sda/sdb).\n\n*Mark all Ubuntu partitions (I always have / and /home) for deletion. Include swap.\n\n*Apply the changes.\n\n*You will have a clean hard disk.\n\n\nOr... You can drill your hard disk.\n\nA: Yes, running sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root will destroy your installation and your motherboard if you have UEFI, leaving only an expensive paperweight , the bootloader (GRUB) and an empty partition.\nNote that this will not securely erase data ! Files deleted in this way can still be recovered using data recovery tools.\n\nTo securely erase the contents of the disk, leaving your computer without any trace of Ubuntu or your files, boot from a Linux / Ubuntu live DVD / USB, and run \nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4M\n\nwhich will securely erase data. Make sure that /dev/sda is the main hard drive in the computer - you can check with lsblk. You can also use DBAN, which might be easier to use - see Byte Commander's answer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 dual boot on Windows 10 on a different partition.

I can't open another virtual terminal thus leaving my only option is to force shutdown the computer by means of holding the power button for 6 seconds.\nFor the moment, I just disabled the \"suspend on lid close\" setting so I'm stuck just shutting down my computer before I travel with it. Not that big of I deal considering the awesome graphics (first GPU in a decade). However, if this is something that can be solved I'd obviously want to.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Welcome to the club. old problem with no solution.\nDepend on what you are doing with your laptop, you should consider switching to intel graphic in Nvidia X server settings.\nThe better solution would be to install bumblebee to be able to run a specific program with dedicated GPU (This is helpful for bumblebee installation). \nAgain, it really depends what you want to do. If you are going to code CUDA, bumblebee might be useful if you run the IDE with bumblebee. If you want to use any code generator for it, bumblebee is not suitable for you (based on my own experience) and you should bear with suspend issue and screen tearing (and probably over heating). \nIf you just want to do day-to-day regular jobs and live you life with your laptop happily, forget about your dedicated graphic and switch to intel graphic forever. \nHope this helped. \n", "Q: VGA splitter doesn't show two separate screens on ubuntu MATE 15.04 A few days ago I was lucky enough to obtain a free monitor and I decided to buy a VGA splitter to use it with my other screen. The splitter is an Aten VS92A, if it can be useful.\nThe device works perfectly, the signal goes to both screens, but for some reason the computer can't see it's connected to two different screens. Instead I see the same view on both monitors.\nTo clarify a bit the situation: I'm using a laptop, so in fact I now have three different screens (but the idea is to shut down the laptop screen as soon as everything works because it renders colors really badly) and the laptop screen is successfully distinguished from the other two. This also means that installing a new graphic card is sadly not an option. Other cables (e.g. HDMI) are also not an option.\nI found other cases similar to mine, but I can't find a solution that works for me. As I understand, it seems that the computer doesn't identify the EDID of the second screen and to further confirm this hypothesis I can say that, if I switch the cables connected to the splitter, the resolution adapts to the best settings for the screen connected on port 1.\nI also saw a lot of people saying: \"with linux I see twice the same image and with windows a split screen.\" This means that the splitter sends all the useful information to the computer, but the computer can't see it or it doesn't even look for it. Sadly (not really) I don't have windows installed on my computer, so I can't verify this step, but the splitter manual said indeed that it is possible to obtain a split screen, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.\nNow, for the useful information about my computer:\nuname -a\nLinux #### 3.19.0-65-generic #73-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 28 17:02:53 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nDesktop environment: MATE\ncat /etc/X11/default-diplay-manager\nusr/sbin/lightdm\n\nxrandr -q\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3286 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767\nLVDS1 connected 1366x768+0+312 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 174mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA1 connected 1920x1080+1366+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 473mm x 300mm\n   1920x1080      60.0*+\n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1280x800       59.8  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1280x720       60.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     70.1     60.0  \n   832x624        74.6  \n   800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0  \n   640x480        75.0     72.8     66.7     60.0     59.9  \n   720x400        70.1  \nVIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nAnd switching monitors on the splitter the same command shows (only the different part):\nVGA1 connected 1440x900+1366+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 408mm x 255mm\n   1440x900       59.9*+   75.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1280x800       59.8  \n   1152x864       75.0  \n   1280x720       60.0  \n   1024x768       75.1     70.1     60.0  \n   832x624        74.6  \n   800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2  \n   848x480        60.0  \n   640x480        75.0     72.8     66.7     60.0     59.9  \n   720x400        70.1 \n\nContent of /var/log/Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/TgfnQzJU\nI can't find xorg.conf, but there are two files that have both the same content, formatted as a few examples of xorg.conf I found elsewhere, they are called xorg.conf.07292015 and xorg.conf.07302015 and their content can be found here: http://pastebin.com/gUBBGRti\nThe available drivers and the one in use can be found in this screenshot:  \n\nnvidia-settings -q all\n\nreturns an empty line.\nIntuitively it seems to me that xrandr should see a VGA2 together with VGA1, but with different settings.

Has anyone had success streaming music via a miniDSP usbstreamer b unit? \nI'm attempting to cut out an extraneous digital->analogue conversion in my laptop-powered stereo system.   The usbstreamer b unit would allow my stereo to do just a single digital to analogue conversion.  Hopefully there is a way to make it compatible with Linux.  \nUbuntu 16.04 recognises the unit and can be configured to send audio to it.  But the usbstreamer does not appear to be generating a toslink signal, so I suspect Ubuntu is sending the wrong data to the usbstreamer.  \nI've set the firmware on the usbstreamer to toslink, using a windows box. \nedit (July 1st 1016): I can get some sound to broadcast from my laptop.  If I run the ALSA test wav files through aplay, they play.   But I can't get any other sound to broadcast to the usbstreamer.  \nDoes anyone know what this is a symptom of?  aplay works, but no other system sounds get broadcast?  In particular I would like to get to the point where I could get software like Rythmbox to play via the streamer.  For example, in the \"Sound Settings\" dialogue (Ubuntu default) if I set output to USBStreamer, this results in none of the system sounds being sent to usbstreamer -- or at least, not in a way that the streamer can understand. Because they don't play.\nHere is what I have done that has been successful:\naplay -l\n\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC269VC Analog [ALC269VC Analog]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: USBStreamer [USBStreamer], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: NVidia [HDA NVidia], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\nSubdevices: 1/1\nSubdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\naplay -D plughw:1,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Side_Left.wav\n\nAfter some googling around it appears the usb-audio driver needs some setting up.  ALSA sees the usbstreamer, but it looks like Ubuntu has no ready-made driver and ?perhaps? something can be cobbled-together with the usb-audio driver. It looks like I might have to set up an .asoundrc file.   These pages seem particularly relevant:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/UsbAudioDevices\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-usb-audio\nedit 2: \nFinally, I'm playing music with mplayer, from my linux laptop to my speakers, via the usbstreamer and minidsp 4x10hd unit.\nThe key thing I did not understand is it's better not to use pulseaudio with high-end speakers. . . and the Linux community figured that out long ago. So they developed a distinct audio interface, called Jack.\nI haven't figured out all the quirks yet, but the \"Jack audio connection kit\" has a nice GUI for setting up the audio interface. mplayer will stream straight to jack.\nSo all my music appears to play fine, now. Hmm, likely I'll have to rip all my music at a higher sample rate, now...\nOnce I have everything working smoothly I'll post something that is hopefully easier to follow, perhaps as an answer. \n\nA: The Jack Audio Connection kit does precisely what I'm looking for. The main issue I ran into is I was trying to solve my problem with Pulseaudio, but it appears jackd is the daemon of choice for hi-end audio, in Linux. \nJack-plumbing makes setting up persistent connections between applications and the audio system convenient, especially on linux boxes that do not have monitors.  qjackctl is one of many ways you can do it if you want to use a GUI.  I found the jack-plumbing file format a little obtuse, so I used qjackctl to help determine the file format.   \nFor example, \n(connect \"MPlayer \\[[0-9]+\\]:out_0\" \"system:playback_9\")\n(connect \"MPlayer \\[[0-9]+\\]:out_1\" \"system:playback_10\")\n\nis the contents of my .jack-plumbing file (at the top of my home directory) that sets up a persistent connection between mplayer and my audio system. \nI grabbed these lines from the qjackctl \"patchbay\" file:\n<!DOCTYPE patchbay>\n<patchbay version=\"0.4.2\" name=\"patchbay\">\n<output-sockets>\n<socket exclusive=\"off\" name=\"MPlayer \\[[0-9]+\\] 1\" client=\"MPlayer \\[[0-9]+\\]\" type=\"jack-audio\">\n<plug>out_0</plug>\n<plug>out_1</plug>\n</socket>\n</output-sockets>\n<input-sockets>\n<socket exclusive=\"off\" name=\"system 1\" client=\"system\" type=\"jack-audio\">\n<plug>playback_9</plug>\n<plug>playback_10</plug>\n</socket>\n</input-sockets>\n<slots/>\n<cables>\n<cable output=\"MPlayer \\[[0-9]+\\] 1\" input=\"system 1\" type=\"jack-audio\"/>\n</cables>\n</patchbay>\n\nA command such as\nmplayer -ao jack blah.mp3\n\nis enough to play the blah.mp3 file over the system. \nedit:\nAn alternative solution is to create /etc/asound.conf and make it this:\npcm.usbSTR {\n  type hw\n  card USBStreamer\n  device 0\n}\npcm.usbREMAP {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbSTR\n  ttable.0.8 1\n  ttable.1.9 1\n}\npcm.!default {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbREMAP\n}\nctl.!default {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbREMAP\n}\nThis allows you to avoid Jack altogether, and pipe directly to ALSA. \n", "Q: Display is on 42\" TV on Kbuntu I have installed Kbuntu 16.04 LTS\n\n\n*\n\n*On Intel® Desktop Board DH55TC\n\n*With Intel® Core™ i3 CPU 540 @ 3.07GHz\n\n*500 GB SATA hard drive\n\n*Connected to 42\" LG TV with HDMI cable\n\n*TP-Link 300 MB USB wireless LAN\n\n*Wireless keyboard & mouse\n\n\nAll drivers are installed properly, display is also nice.

What should i do to save both OS and all my data. Please help.\n\nA: modifying your partition size also caused your partition ID to change. This means grub doesn't know from which partition to boot. Let's say, your /boot directory is on your 2nd partition, aka sda2, then, if your system has traditional BIOS (not UEFI):\nin the grub rescue do: linux (hd0,2)/boot/linux-image- and hit Tab for autocomlete (since I assume you don't know your kernel version) and enter, then initrd (hd0,2)/boot/initr and again hit Tab and enter. After that enter boot.\nonce booted, edit /etc/fstab as root and replace the old UUID with the correct UUID for each partition, which you get from the output of blkid. After that run update-grub as root.\n\nA: 0h thank god !

So, I was using ubuntu 15.10 for a LONG time, but I got bored with unity. I then downloaded ubuntu Gnome. Now, I don't really love unity, but i DO want to like to work on that for sometimes. So my main question is : does ubuntu Gnome have unity pre-installed on it or not?\n\nA: NO, it does NOT. That's why it's called Ubuntu Gnome! Only Ubuntu has Unity preinstalled. That's why all Ubuntu flavors have different names and only ONE desktop environment preinstalled. So you don't confuse them up.\n\nA: No it does not but you have some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*I myself use an LTS as my main operating system (the one I boot into) and have instances for the latest operating systems I use.  So in virtualbox I have a 16.04 that I use for daily use. Watch movies, series while commuting. And another few for work related things (I have a copy of all the systems my clients work on).\nBiggest advantages compared to the other methods I will list: deleting an OS is easy. Copying an OS is easy. Running 2 or more is easy (but a resource hog ;) ). Making a backup is easy. \nExample on how this looks:\n\n\n\n*Create a multi boot. You can have Ubuntu Gnome and Ubuntu itself and tons of operating systems next to each other sharing a data partition so you can watch video's, code software, listen to music that is on that partition with all of the operating systems. \n\n*You can also install multiple desktops on the same machine and pick the one you want during login. \nHere is an old image with Gnome, Cinnamon, Steam OS and Ubuntu:\n\n", "Q: External monitor(s) dark out on one account and I cannot set monitor layout, how to fix?

To fix, remove ~/.config/monitors.xml, immediately log out and back in.\nSetting up your (complicated) monitor setup from cli\nYou mentioned the step above fixed the darkening screen(s), but you still cannot setup the screens in the layout you wanted (see below). That is possibly caused by a bug. We might very well be able to work around it by setting it up from cli.\nTo set up the screen layout as you described in a comment:\n\nYou'd need to run the xrandr command:\nxrandr --output DP1-1 --pos 0x0 \\\n--output DP1-2 --pos 1920x0 \\\n--output DP1-1 --pos 0x360 \\\n--output eDP1 --pos 1440x1440\n\n...if I made no typo or other mistake...\nExplanation\nNormally, in a complicated screen layout, you simply need to work from left to right, from top to bottom.\nHowever\nIf you don't know for sure what is the current layout, you cannot place the first screen, other than 0x0. If there is empty space in the top of your screen layout, xrandr will remove the empty space and change e.g. 0x200 into 0x0. Therefore the steps need to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*position DP1-1 and DP1-2 horizontally top-alligned: \nxrandr --output DP1-1 --pos 0x0 --output DP1-2 --pos 1920x0\n\n\n\n*only then bottom-align DP1-1 with DP1-2:\nxrandr --output DP1-1 --pos 0x360\n\n\n\n*place eDP1 in the middle below the other two screens:\nxrandr --output eDP1 --pos 1440x1280\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the small script below into an empty file, save it as setup_screens.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxrandr --output DP1-1 --pos 0x0 \\\n--output DP1-2 --pos 1920x0 \\\n--output DP1-1 --pos 0x360 \\\n--output eDP1 --pos 1440x1440\n\n\n*Make it executable\n\n*Test-run it from a terminal, run the command:\n/path/to/setup_screens.sh\n\n\n*Either run it from a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

So to delete it you can either changing the ownership and then delete it (here you elevate your rights and become 'root' for taking the ownership):\nsudo chown $USER:$USER ./shadi\nrm -r ./shadi\n\nOr you skip taking the ownership and make a sudo rm to elevate your rights and become 'root' for the deletion:\nsudo rm -r ./shadi\n\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo rm -r ./shadi\n\nThe permissions show owner root and group root, so you have to use sudo.\n\nA: you must get root access first by:\nsudo su\n\nthen force deleting the file\nrm -rf ./shadi\n\n", "Q: Controlling apt-get headers I have multiple machines out in the field and want to have unattended upgrades, which seems supported by apt-get.

For this you could either use a prebuilt proxy, or use this code as a starting point.\nServer Managing System\nAs an alternative option, you could use a system like Landscape, which have the following features.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can manage all your servers from one web UI, or using the provided API\n\n*You can set update rules\n\n*You can push new packages to servers or sets of servers\n\n*You can run scripts on managed servers\n\n*You can have emails sent automatically and packages applied automatically when you have security flaws affecting your servers.\n\n*You can check server status and information\n\n\nIt is free for up to 10 servers, the setup instructions are here\nEdit:\nHaving checked the source it seems it is not possible to set custom headers at this point, only the following headers seem to be set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host => Server Host name\n\n*Cache-Control => Used for caching\n\n*Accept => The type of response to send\n\n*Range => Used to request a set amount of data\n\n*If-Modified-Since => Used to only get updated data\n\n*Proxy-Authorization => Used for proxy connection login\n\n*Authorization => Used for username / pass auth\n\n*User-Agent => Says what software is used\n\n\nIf you really wanted you could always hide your auth payload in the User-Agent header, but that is not adding a new header as requested.\n\nA: Not sure about the JWT, but you can for sure add a client cert based authentication which could help much in securing your packages, if that is your main concern. \n\napt-get install apt-transport-https\n\nand get the configuration setup \nAcquire::https::packagedomain.name.com::Verify-Peer \"false\";\nAcquire::https::packagedomain.name.com::Verify-Host \"false\";\nAcquire::https::packagedomain.name.com::CaInfo \"/certs/ca.pem\";\nAcquire::https::packagedomain.name.com::SslCert \"/path/clientcert.pem\";\nAcquire::https::packagedomain.name.com::SslKey  \"/path/clientkey.pem\";\n\non the nginx side enable the following directives\n         \"ssl_client_certificate\",\n         \"ssl_verify_client\",\n\n", "Q: Can't get root passworldless ssh to work I have master and slave machines and wish to be able to passwordless ssh between root accounts.\nOn slave I did sudo su -

See man ssh_config for details.\n\nAs a side note, if you are doing passwordless ssh you should not need to set root's login password (although not doing so initially means you will need to manually copy the public key to root's authorized_keys file, using sudo, since you won't be able to use ssh-copy-id) and you should use PermitRootLogin without-password rather than PermitRootLogin yes in the remote system's /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.\n", "Q: How to limit the amount of time SCP tries to connect for? I have a bash script which copies any files in a 'to_send' directory, to a remote server via scp. The script runs an scp command on each file, checks the return code, and moves the local version from the to_send directory to a 'sent' directory if successful. If unsuccessful the file stays in the 'to_send' directory, ready to attempt sending the next time the script is run.\nThe scp uses a URL and non standard port number to send via an internet connection. I have an issue whereby, if the connection to the remote server is not possible, each instance of the scp command takes about two minutes to determine that it cannot connect. This is not a terrible overhead if there's only one file to send, but will cause problems if there are several files to send.\nIs there a way to limit how long the attempt to connect will continue trying for? Perhaps by passing an option to ssh with the -o option of scp?\n\nA: You can pass along SSH options, like -o ConnectTimeout=10 to timeout after 10 seconds.\nBut if you're copying multiple files, rsync might be worth looking at. And you'd probably use --contimeout 10 for an rsync command.\n", "Q: Enable password on lock screen I have a problem with restoring the password request on the lock screen.

Being generic the answer is long.\nAssuming that:\n\n\n*\n\n*yr networked scanner is switched on.\n\n*yr device is connected to:\na) the network as a stand alone LAN device (direct LAN-setup).\nb) a computer and shared over the network: that computer is referred to as the LAN-server. All other networked computers are called LAN-clients. Setting this up differs from what follows. That case is not covered here.\n\n*packages hplip, sane-utils, libsane as well as libsane-extras are correctly installed. The latter requires the universe repo to be enabled. \n\n*you have added user saned to groups lp and scanner with: \n\n\nIn terminal\n$ sudo adduser saned {scanner,lp}\n\nIn reality only one of those two groups (lp, scanner) is needed, but you can safely add saned to both. It won't hurt. HP scanners of type MFP tend to be added to lp, others to scanner. This is required when scanning from a USB connected all-in-one shared on the network, i.e. through a scan-server. I have not verified that it is required for stand-alone LAN scanners. Again if not, it won't hurt.\n\n\n*\n\n*you have edited /etc/sane.d/dll.conf, to try to enable the correct scan-driver for yr device. Try looking for \"The following backends are not part of the SANE distribution ...\" in that configuration file. Below that you'll find commented lines corresponding to scanners that are either not directly supported (untested) or partially supported. Uncomment lines as you deem appropriate, save file.\n\n\nFrom the Ubuntu community's Scanning-HowTo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the device can be pinged.\n\n*Run the hp-setup wizard which installs printer, scanner, HpAllInOne and any other features.\n\n\nIn terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4  # required only for Ubuntu 14.04\n$ sudo hp-setup\n\nFor Connection Type choose \"Network/Ethernet...\"\nIf the device is not detected, click \"Show advanced options\", tick \"Manual discovery\" and supply the scanner's IP address. \nCheck the scanner is now recognized:\n$ scanimage -L\n\nAlas, if yr scanning device is still not detected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the URI of the printer\n\n\nInside a terminal window, execute:\n $ hp-makeuri IP-ADDRESS\n\nwhere \"IP-ADDRESS\" should be replaced with the IP address of your printer. This will show the CUPS (printing) and SANE (scanning) URIs for your printer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Access yr networked scanner (two approaches):\n\n\na) temporarily access scanner by supplying  the SANE URI to xsane every time you execute it:\n$ xsane SANE-URI\n\nwhere \"SANE-URI\" is the SANE URI returned by hp-makeuri.\nb) make scanner permanently accessible, if CUPS is configured to use the 'hp' backend to access the printer instead of the 'socket' backend. This can be done by editing printers.conf:\n$ sudo vim /etc/cups/printers.conf\n\nand replacing the 'socket' DeviceURI with the 'hp' URI returned by hp-makeuri. Restart cups after making this change:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart\n\nHTH.

In that case you'll have to define DISPLAY appropriately.\nIf you don't want to have to enter your sudo password every time yr backup job runs, or if you want it to run unattended, then go to: /etc/sudoers.d/ and sudo-edit the file 10_user or whatever name you choose, with:\n%admin yr_host = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/FreeFileSync\n\nwhere admin is any user group that contains you and those you authorize to run FreeFileSync with root privileges.

Update your xorg-server. Thank you.\n\n\nA: (EOL of 15.10 expires today! I hope this helps!)\nThere is an old app (2012) that did the trick for me in my previous laptop. It is called Magick Rotation. Fint the latest .deb file here. Note, apparently it only works for Lenovo, Dell, Fujitsu, and HP. To install, do as usual:\nsudo dpkg -i file.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f \n\nThe app has a nice GUI, that you can see below:\n\nNote: since this is an old app, some old dependencies might be needed. Be careful!\nIn the Advanced Setup menu you can setup the onboard keyboard to run after rotation. It is very likely you will not have CellWriter (the default), as it is not shipped with 14.04 and newer ubuntus. In your case, this keyboard must be onboard.

I have a new Ubuntu 12.04 that's not connected to the internet.

Then dependencies will be automatically filled.\nThe downside of this is that you'll use (a little) more cellular data -- the upside is that you'll save loads of time and you can be sure stuff is working while your computer is (temporarily) connected to the Internet.\n\nA: Find another system that has 12.04 and then install everything you want using synaptic or app store, (or terminal).\nThen copy all of the files you find in (root)/var/cache/apt and to your machine in the same directory (with root access).  You still might need to have an updated cache, but all heavy downloading should be finished with this method.  Do not copy the lock file.. and it won't let you anyways.\nI usually type (you might type nautilus instead of caja for ubuntu) to launch a gui file manager with su privs.  It is dangerous, but terminal can be more dangerous.  Close it when you are done.\ngksu caja\n\nThe next method \nThe next method.. I think I tested this..

For the big downloads, go to starbucks or a free wifi hotspot.\n\nA: All newer versions of ubuntu have iw installed by default. Install a newer version to avoid such a headache.\nAlso, you can go to http://packages.ubuntu.com where you can see a list of dependencies for each package you select.\nYou can use the command dpkg -l | grep packagename to search for installed packages. example:\ndpkg -l | grep iw\n\nIf you connect to the internet and use apt-get to do the install, it will automatically satisfy all dependencies for you.\nI suggest you connect to the internet.\n", "Q: How to remove GRUB Nothing is Working!

It will force your computer to boot with the install device rather than grub.\nYou should now be in the install menu of Windows \"YourVersion\" : now this is why you backed up your data : format every partition of your hard drive in this menu, and then let the software install Windows. \nNormally grub should be gone and Windows be the only operating system on your machine.

The program contains an adware component that must be installed with the program and the EULA for that component says you cannot use anti-adware software against it. In addition, use of such software may damage the component and make it difficult to remove. FILExt has removed links to this software and advises that you install it AT YOUR OWN RISK. If you receive a \"compressed\" ZIX file you are advised to warn the sender and ask them to resend the file in a more conventional format (e.g., ZIP).\" \n\nhttp://filext.com/file-extension/ZIX\nedit: There do appear to be ways to open .zix files without installing spyware, such as http://www.kennethsorling.se/software/unzixwin.htm , but you would have to try running them in WINE, as they are for Windows.

How would one configure and outfit the drive so that when it is installed in the laptop it will boot up and configure the operating system?\nQUESTIONS\nIf this is possible, them I believe that this has been done before and there is good documentation of how to do this.  I simply do not know the term to Google to find this info.  If you have done this before: what is a good URL to learn how to outfit a self-installing drive?  Are there any pitfalls or lessons-learned?  If you have performed this successfully, please state this in your reply.  Thank you\n\nA: All you should need to do is install a 32-bit version of Ubuntu to the SSD using your other computer; after that, once the drive is transferred to the neighbor's laptop, chances are good it will detect and adjust to the new hardware without problems.\nConnect the SSD to your computer via USB cable, then boot your computer into a 32-bit live Ubuntu DVD or USB stick (as if you were going to install Ubuntu on the computer). However, in the Ubuntu installer, you will be choosing to install Ubuntu to the SSD, not your computer's main hard drive. Also make sure that when the installer asks where to install the GRUB bootloader, you choose to install it to the SSD (not your main hard drive).\nOnce the Ubuntu installer is complete, you should be able to transfer the SSD into the ASUS laptop and it should boot into Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64 bit) freezes ever time I have recently installed 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 in my computer along with 64-bit Windows 10 (Dual boot).

The only problem is that they are preceded by a useless string (I'm reading characteristics of the BLE device so they have a \"Notification handle = 0x000c value: FF FF\"). I only need the hex string at the end for my data. \nCurrently I log the terminal output window using script and then from the created text file, I extract the hex values and convert them into voltages which I then plot. However, I have to actually perform both of these commands, so I'm effectively taking screenshots of the data.\nI'm wondering if there was some way to only write the hex values into a .dat file and manipulate them, because then I can actually plot the data in real time.

Someone told me to put Ubuntu on a USB when my Windows became corrupted (for some unknown reason) a few weeks ago. But I need access to my hard drive. Most things are backed up but I don't think everything is. I need to check it. I have not installed Ubuntu, I am running it off the USB. I have watched a dozen YouTube videos and read instructions on how to mount the hard drive but I cannot do it. I don't understand the language used in the answers or videos. I need someone to explain it to me like I am person who uses computers solely to compose word documents and for the internet. That is my level.\nI know how to get to the disk and can see what I believe is my hard drive listed, but I don't know what to do after that.\n\nA: First open terminal by holding ctrl + alt then click t. With Terminal open you are ready to begin.\nNext, you will want to list your drives. You have a few options. I like fdisk but you could also run lsblk as it may be easier for you. You can skip down to lsblk as I explain this below too.\nfdisk\nfdisk -l\n\nThis will output a bunch of details about your hard drives. What you are looking for is /dev/sd* (* in this case, means any letter a-z. e.g. My primary drive is /dev/sda)\nYou will also want to look at the Device details for the drive to identify the partition on the drive that holds the OS. For me, this is /dev/sda1. (sda being the hard drive, sda1 with 1 being the partition of the drive that is my OS. You can tell this due to the size of the partition.) \nNext you will want to see what is already mounted.\ndf -h\n\nWill show you what is currently mounted. You are making sure that the drive you identified in the first step is not already listed in here (this would be /dev/sda1 as my example above) as mounted. If it is located in this list, you will see the mount point (where you need to go to access the drive) on the right side and there is nothing more to do other than to cd to that location to access your files.\nlsblk\nlsblk\n\nThis outputs a simple representation of your hard drive structure that is easier to understand than fdisk. You are still trying to identify the hard drive location /dev/sda and the OS partition /dev/sda1 as I explain in fdisk. You can see in this output if there is a mount point for the drive you are looking for too; if so, there is nothing more to do other than to cd to that location to access your files.\nMounting the Drive\nIf you do not see the drive listed as mounted, you will want to mount it.\nTo mount the drive you need to first prepare a location to mount it. I like to use /mnt/Windows so let's create that mount point.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/Windows\n\nNow that the mount point is created, to mount the drive to it you run: (Note that I am using /dev/sda1 as /dev/sda is the drive I wanted to mount and the partition on the mount is 1 for my case; if yours is different you will want to use that letter you got from step 1)\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/Windows\n\nNow you should be able to see the files by running ls\nls -la /mnt/Windows\n\n\nA: On the left of the screen, near the top, there should be an icon that looks like a file cabinet. Click it. It might flash for a bit, then a window should open.\nNear the left of this window, there should be a \"Devices\" label. Under it, you should see your hard drive partitions (a partition is basically a section of your hard drive). If there's more than one, you probably won't recognize the one you want, but that's okay; just click on all the drives under the \"Devices\" label and look for a folder named Users in each one (the files and folders in the drive you clicked on will be shown in the main section of the window)\nOnce you've found the partition you want (the one with the Users folder in it), double click on the Users folder. There should be a folder for your user (its name will be your username); double-click on it. Your Documents, Pictures, Music, etc. folders should be there; double-click on them to go into them and press the back button in the top left to go back to your user folder. Any public files should be in the Public user folder.\n", "Q: Switched to GNOME, no password prompt on wakeup After months of using Ubuntu I decided to switch from Unity to GNOME.

I tried to edit this file by deleting tags, but without success. The problem is that there are a number of additional characters around the tag you might or might not have to delete but to me it is not clear where to start and stop deleting. \nAfter editing the file hamster did not respond and the only solution to this is to restore the file.

I'm using the Cinnamon desktop if that matters. I have a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive. I've run fsck on the drive, and it shows no errors.\nUntil recently, when I inserted the drive into a USB port it would not auto-mount. It would show up in the output of lsusb, as:\nBus 001 Device 008: ID 058f:6387 Alcor Micro Corp. Flash Drive\n\nI was able to mount it manually, using something like:\nsudo mkdir /tmp/usb ; sudo mount /dev/sdg1 /tmp/usb\n\nbut that was less than ideal.\nI recently installed the usbmount package. After that (and a reboot), when I insert the drive it automatically mounts as /media/usb0:\n$ df /media/usb0\nFilesystem     1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sdg1       15712248  9080  15703168   1% /media/usb0\n$ \n\nThe problem: I can read everything on the drive, but it all appears to be owned by root and I can't write to the drive without using sudo or equivalent.\nWhat I want to happen is this: When I insert the drive, it's automatically mounted as /media/username/label, where username is my user name and label is the volume label on the drive -- and all files on the drive are owned and writable by my account.\nThis used to happen automatically, but I don't know how I set it up. Some time ago, I upgraded my workstation from Debian 6 to Ubuntu 14.04. I had the auto-mounting worked the way I want it when I was running Debian 6. I was also using a different desktop environment (some version of Gnome, perhaps?). (The transition from Debian 6 to Ubuntu 14.04 happened to coincide with me not using USB drives as much; now I need to start using them again, so I haven't tried this in a while.)\n\nA: I think I've figured out what happened.\nI had installed a package called usbmount. With that package installed, inserting a USB drive would automatically mount it as something like /media/usb0, with everything on the drive owned by root. (This is for a drive with a FAT32 filesystem, which for various reasons is what I need to use. I don't know how it would work with a filesystem that actually supports file ownership.)\nI've since uninstalled the usbmount.  Now when I insert a USB thumb drive, it isn't automatically mounted -- but it does show up in the GUI file manager. (I use the Cinnamon desktop, so my GUI file manager is Nemo; Nautilus does the same thing.) It appears as an entry in the left column, labeled \"16 GB Volume\"). If I then double-click on that, it's then mounted as, for example, /media/kthompson/EC1C-4374. And if I then use gparted to set the drive's label to THUMB, it's mounted as /media/kthompson/THUMB, which is exactly what I want.\nIt's likely I didn't notice this because I don't use the GUI file manager very often, and that I incorrectly remembered it being mounted automatically.\nIt would be nice to have the drive mounted under /media/$USER automatically, but opening a GUI file manager and double-clicking an icon isn't much of a burden. And if it were mounted automatically, it's probably not 100% clear which user should own it; that's probably why usbmount mounts it as root.\n\nA: Possible answer:\nI'm not sure how to do this for all USB drives universally, but if you have specific drives, you can edit /etc/fstab to set up their mounts how you like them. You can use Disks (gnome-disks), or if you don't mind getting your hands dirty, you can edit it manually. You'll want to set a <mount point> and I think you'll want these options:\nuid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=022,fmask=022,users\n\nRun man fstab for more info.

It looks pretty derpy on a wide-format screen.\nI've tried using xrandr to add the correct resolution as a mode, as in this thread, but I got several unexpected gamma errors (although it sounds like they're not a problem?) and the computer doesn't do anything:\nalex@dongle:~$ cvt 1024 600 60\n# 1024x600 59.85 Hz (CVT) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 49.00 MHz\nModeline \"1024x600_60.00\"   49.00  1024 1072 1168 1312  600 603 613 624 -hsync +vsync\nalex@dongle:~$ xrandr --newmode \"1024x600_60.00\"   49.00  1024 1072 1168 1312  600 603 613 624 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nalex@dongle:~$ xrandr --verbose\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 800 x 600, current 800 x 600, maximum 800 x 600\ndefault connected 800x600+0+0 (0x26f) normal (normal) 0mm x 0mm\n    Identifier: 0x26e\n    Timestamp:  18212\n    Subpixel:   unknown\n    Clones:    \n    CRTC:       0\n    CRTCs:      0\n    Transform:  1.000000 0.000000 0.000000\n                0.000000 1.000000 0.000000\n                0.000000 0.000000 1.000000\n               filter: \n  800x600 (0x26f) 36.000MHz *current\n        h: width   800 start    0 end    0 total  800 skew    0 clock  45.00KHz\n        v: height  600 start    0 end    0 total  600           clock  75.00Hz\n  1024x600_60.00 (0x289) 49.000MHz -HSync +VSync\n        h: width  1024 start 1072 end 1168 total 1312 skew    0 clock  37.35KHz\n        v: height  600 start  603 end  613 total  624           clock  59.85Hz\nalex@dongle:~$ xrandr --addmode default \"1024x600_60.00\"\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nalex@dongle:~$ xrandr --output default --mode \"1024x600_60.00\"\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nxrandr: screen cannot be larger than 800x600 (desired size 1024x600)\n\nInterestingly, if I go to Display Settings I can see the new mode, but selecting and applying it doesn't do anything.\nEarlier I noticed that the screen has a min, current, and max of 800x600.

So to get the environment of all running applications do:\nsudo find /proc -name environ -maxdepth 2 | xargs cat | xargs --null --max-args=1\n\n(Thanks to this answer for the part at the end which turns the null-delimited environ files into something human-readable.)\n", "Q: need help with hard drive So I have installed Ubuntu on my 1 TB EXTERNAL hard drive. I also have windows on another drive (its not external). I can't boot from my external one which has Ubuntu on it.

That being said I have had a similar problem. If your external drive is a HDD meaning it has a spinning disk then the problem is that your bios wants to boot something faster then you external drive can spin up. To fix this go into BIOS and most likely a boot tab and look for something that says Harddisk Delay and set it to something higher. This will delay the boot process and allow time for your external drive to spin up allowing bios to detect it.\n", "Q: how to install kjots in ubuntu 16.04 I'm trying to install kjots in ubuntu 16.04 and looks like the package is not available in ubuntu 16.04.\n\n$ sudo apt-get install -s kjots\nReading package lists...

I set up JIRA to work this way as well.  \nI keep getting a 404 Not Found error from Nginx.  \nWhen I tail the Nginx error log, I am seeing this:\n2016/07/01 17:27:29 [error] 50688#50688: *2 open() \"/usr/share/nginx/html/jira\" failed (2: No such file or directory), client: xx.xx.xx.xx, server: www.xxxxxx.net, request: \"GET /jira HTTP/1.1\", host: \"xxxxx.net\"\n\nI know why this error is happening but I cannot for the life of me figure out where Nginx is getting the path its looking for from. Its technically passing the traffic correctly to Apache but its appending /jira to the end of the default directory which is resulting in the 404 not found because that location literally does not exist.  \nWhere is Nginx reading the default location from?  \nI removed everything in my sites-available and sites-enabled directories minus the one needed to set up the forwarding.

The system will not boot normally. I can get to the root prompt in rescue mode.\nThe error happened yesterday. I did a normal update (apt-get dist-upgrade), but did not restart the computer right away due to having some applications open. Later the monitors went to sleep (just the monitors, not the system). However, I could not get out of the blank screen mode with anything I tried (except switching to a virtual console via ALT-F1). So I rebooted the system. But it would not boot normally.

(I'll test them one-by-one until I find the solution.) In general, it would be nice to have an authoritative resource for this very confusing error.\nSee my screen picture:\n\nThere are 3 partitions: sda1, sda2, sda3\nsda1 is /boot/efi\nsda2 is /boot\nsda3 is the LVM-based file system. It has 2 LV's (one is the root fs and one is swap).  \n\nA: Searching the Internet leads to the conclusion that the exact same error can be produced in many different situations. That's true.\nHowever, there is a single underlying issue. Understanding it will help clarify the situation. What is happening is that systemd is dropping into emergency mode by design. The developers consider this correct behavior, not a bug.\nThe message is from polkit. The recommended steps after receiving this message are to drop into a root shell and run the following command:\njournalctl -xb -p3\n\nIn particular, look for fstab entries that reference non-existent devices. Or, if it is a device that needs to remain listed in fstab, consider adding the nofail boot option to it. (Some recommend adding nofail to all fstab entries now.)\nIn this thread, giulioo gives an acerbic set of steps for recovering from this error:\n1) Run:\njournalctl -xb -p3\n\n2) Let's say you realize fstab was the problem, you then correct the problem in fstab (e.g., by adding nofail or by removing a problematic device listing) and press CTRL-D, and what happens? This happens:\nError getting authority. Error initializing authority: Could not connect: No such file or directory  (g-io-error-quark, 1)\n\nThe system then stalls for another 60 secs, and then you are again presented with the emergency message.\nYou then hopefully realize that maybe fstab-generator early in the boot created unit files from fstab and systemd is using the \"old\" unit files instead of the updated fstab.\nSo you try:\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\nAgain you get:\nError getting authority. Error initializing authority: Could not connect: No such file or directory  (g-io-error-quark, 1)\n\nBut this time the system won't stall, so you again press press CTRL-D and you get:\nError getting authority.

But this sequence is not working in 16.04. What is the best alternative?\nIn ubuntu 16.04, after changing interfaces file and ifdown/ifup sequence, ip addr show <device> command shows both old and new static IP addresses for <device>. I used -v (verbose) argument with ifdown/ifup in both ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. The difference was in ifdown. In ubuntu 14.04 ifdown executes this command:\nip -4 addr flush dev <device> label <device>\n\nWhile in 16.04:\nip addr del <ip-address-in-network-interfaces>/<subnet> dev <device> label <device>\n\nSo I figured out, in 16.04, If I first run the ifdown command. Then change the IP address in /etc/network/interfaces file and then use the ifup command to bring the interface up again, the old IP address will be deleted correctly.\nAnother solution is running the ip addr flush command before ifdown/ifup:\nip addr flush dev <device>\n\nIt seems that I already answered my question, but I want to know what are the alternatives and what is the best solution to change a static IP address in Ubuntu 16.04?\n\nA: you can add flush inside interfaces definition like \n\niface eth0 inet manual\n  post-down ip addr flush dev $IFACE\n\n", "Q: Persistent Ubuntu USB drive Persistent Ubuntu on a USB drive\nI have followed the instructions on How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X on the Ubuntu site, and the boot image runs well on my Lenovo laptop.\nThe problem is that the image is not persistent: when I reboot the laptop, all the installed apt-get package and file in /home/Desktop disappear.\nHow do I create a persistent Ubuntu installation on a USB drive, which keeps its state between reboots?\nPrevious questions:\nThis has been asked before (Persistent Ubuntu on a USB drive, Can I install Ubuntu to my 32 GB USB pen drive?, but they are either old, or don't cover my case - creating the USB drive from OSX.\n\nA: I see you are able to boot into Ubuntu. In that case you could then create a 'persistent ubuntu drive' from the live Ubuntu using instructions here or here.\nSo you basically have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash drive 1: Made bootable from OSX. This you are able to boot on your Lenovo (but no persistence)\n\n*Flash drive 2: You want this as your persistent Ubuntu drive.\n\n\nWhat you do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live boot into Flash Drive 1 on your Lenovo.\n\n*Install mkusb on it.\n\n*Use mkusb to turn Flash Drive 2 persistent.\nDone.\n\n\nRefer to the links above for a 'how-to' on steps 2,3.\n\nA: You don't want a live cd.

TL;DR: how does an Ubuntu flavor iso installation ( for example Lubuntu ) differ from installing a desktop package via apt-get ? (for instance sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop)\nContext for the question: \nSome time ago I answered a question on AskUbuntu , where I tested in virtual machine removing unity-desktop and installing ubuntu-gnome-desktop. That makes the boot logo ( plymouth ) change, desktop changes, different packages get installed (gnome-network-manager instead of network-manager , if I am not mistaken). It appeared that in effect I've switched to different Ubuntu flavor, even though I started out with the standard Ubuntu system. Hence the question: what differentiates the pre-made Ubuntu flavor iso from installing a package ? Is it all the same base underneath the hood or does installation from iso have specific configurations ? If it's possible to install a flavor via package manager, why then separate flavor iso's exist ? (obvious answer is user convenience, but I think there has to exist other reasons. Canonical is a business , and it makes not a lot of sense for a business to provide additional flavor iso , if a sysadmin or end-user can get the same thing via package manager by themselves). \n\nA: It's quite common for users to want to \"try\" other flavors by installing say flavor-desktop rather than by trying out a whole new iso, either in a VM or in another partition, which, in my opinion, is the cleanest option.\nAs you've noticed, the grub screen, the login and logout screens could all be altered without warning. \nMenus may contain duplicates. Two text editors, two screenshot tools, etc.\nSome default applications may lose their default status. \nNotifications may appear different. A classic case is when one adds the xubuntu (or lubuntu) desktop to Unity! That's because the notification system of xu/lubuntu takes over and the effect persists even after logging out and back into a Unity session.\nReversing the installation of flavor-desktop isn't trivial. The standard discovery is that deleting flavor-desktop doesn't do anything other than remove the metapackage. All the packages installed by the metapackage remain.\nRe. Canonical, it provides Ubuntu. The other flavors are community-driven with Canonical providing infrastructure and hosting and more: check out Jeremy Bicha's post. Other than ensuring that flavors meet certain minimal requirements, Canonical is quite \"hands off\".\nI think it isn't stressed strongly enough that one can mix certain desktop environments provided an adequate amount of research homework is done beforehand! \nIn short, depending on the type of assitance you intend to provide, a clean iso install would be the best option.\nHere are just a few Ask Ubuntu links on the topic:\nRestore Unity after uninstalling Mate\nHow to change splash screen Ubuntu back?\nWhat are the risks if install a secondary desktop environment / interface on my ubuntu? \n\nA: Installations from ISO image and metapackage are no different, when metapackages are installed from server ISO and minimal CD images. Users who use an official ISO image and purge packages of existing flavour, then install packages of another flavour may see no difference as well.\nTherefore, the metapackages could provide same installation as the ISO images. The following sources seem to support the similarity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu community has suggested its metapackage in this page on Lubuntu Wiki.\n\n[...] use the server ISO. When prompted as to what to install unmark everything (space bar) except basic server and press tab to get to OK. Once installed, login and then do:\nsudo apt install lubuntu-desktop\n\nto add in the lubuntu system [...] \n\n\n*Ubuntu community has mentioned its metapackage in this page on generic Wiki, albeit bit outdated to this answered date (since Ubuntu now installs Unity instead of GNOME).\n\n[...] For example, the ubuntu-desktop metapackage installs the full GNOME desktop environment, with all the other packages that are in a default Ubuntu install. The existence of meta-packages makes it very easy to install other Ubuntu derivatives on your desktop; [...]\n\n\n*This other page on generic Wiki has mentioned similarly.\n\n[...] For example, an Ubuntu user can install the Kubuntu environment (KDE and all its associated programs) by selecting \"kubuntu-desktop.\" \n\n\n*The last mentioned page also has listed metapackages by category, and the relevant ones are the first two: \"Desktop Metapackages\" and \"Ubuntu System Metapackages\". This simply means \"KDE\" does not equal to \"Kubuntu\", \"Xfce\" does not equal to \"Xubuntu\" and so forth.\nRevised answers\n\nwhat differentiates the pre-made Ubuntu flavor iso from installing a package ?\n\nNo difference for the installation itself. What differentiates between the two is the user experience of installing the product. This is a big deal for end users who expect the product to be available in appropriately packaged form, rather than installing the relevant metapackage via Terminal.\n\nIs it all the same base underneath the hood or does installation from iso have specific configurations ?\n\nYes, both installations have same settings. This is achieved by installing the \"default settings\" package for respective flavours, except Ubuntu one is named as ubuntu-settings. Usually, the \"default settings\" package is already a dependency of respective metapackages.\nHowever, ISO image itself is different because it must contain the installer and additional packages to be bootable and installable. The resulting installation is the same because these packages will be removed later; The installer itself will not be available on local machine once installed.\n\nIf it's possible to install a flavor via package manager, why then separate flavor iso's exist ?\n\nA product is most meaningful when tangible and works as advertised. ISO images are more tangible than the metapackages. ISO images will work as advertised upon made as bootable discs. The metapackage will require some knowledge and effort to make it work and not quite a product.\nRevised evaluation\nIt is important to note that metapackages in this answer mainly refers to metapackages for Ubuntu and its flavours. These shall not be mistaken for metapackages of particular desktop environment such as GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon and RazorQt. While Ubuntu and its flavours can have multiple metapackages, user will just have to look for *-desktop metapackages for relevant ones.\nFinally, returning to the top question:\n\nTL;DR: how does an Ubuntu flavor iso installation ( for example Lubuntu ) differ from installing a desktop package via apt-get ? (for instance sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop)\n\nI have named three differences: User experience, more tangible, works as advertised (or as intended). For end users, less knowledge and less effort are required for installing from an ISO image when compared to installing the metapackage.\nUser convenience is another thing, but not necessarily applicable to all ISO images. For example, a minimal CD is convenient for small size to download but has more steps for installation. The minimal CD is useful to prepare custom installations, thus offers flexibility rather than convenience.\nWhen users gain more knowledge and more experience, they are less likely to notice the differences. Both experienced and power users can now use Ubuntu and its flavours easier, but the challenges faced by beginning users have not changed.\nLike any beginning users, I was once an ignorant user who couldn't even make a bootable disc from ISO image. I'd have not noticed these differences until recently, I remembered that I was once a beginning user. Above all, I'd always prefer the official ISO image for clean installation.\nDisclaimer\nThis answer is the revised approach based on my experience as beginning user, which is more relevant for end users. The following applies.\n\n\n*\n\n*I did not actually compare installation from ISO image and installation from metapackage, side by side. There are supporting facts that could tell these are technically the same.\n\n*I could not find relevant views of Canonical or leading members of community; This answer only contains my own views, findings and facts from the Web.\nTL;DR Installation from ISO image is technically the same as installation from metapackage, provided the base system has no other flavour and the correct metapackage is installed. ISO image is more tangible, will work as advertised and close to the actual product.\n\nRelated posts on Ask Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly is in ubuntu-desktop?\n\n*Should I use tasksel, tasks in APT or install regular metapackages?\n\n*How remove all programs from a meta-package?\n", "Q: How to extend my Linux partition?

Install a copy of the system you are checking from known good source (DVD for example), install the same updates of the target system), have tripwire create the checksum file.  Copy tripwire's checksum file to the target system, have tripwire compare checksum file with target system's files.\nOut of sync updates / upgrades / installs / system specific configuration files will of course be flagged / marked as changed.\nUpdate 2018-05-06: \nI should also add that the target system must be checked offline.  If the target has been compromised, the hardware, boot firmware, os kernel, kernel drivers, system libraries, binaries may have already been compromised and interfere or return false positives.  Even running across a network into the target system might not be safe since the (compromised) target system would be processing the network packets, file system, block device, etc. localy.\nThe smallest comparable scenario that comes to mind are smart cards (EMV used in credit cards, PIV used by federal government, etc.).  Disregarding wireless interfaces, and all the hw/electrical/rf protections, the contact interface is essentially a serial port, three wire, or two wire.  The API is standardized and white boxed so everyone agrees it is impervious.  Did they protect the data in transit, in runtime memory, at rest in flash memory?\nBut the implementation is closed source.  A backdoor may exist in the hardware to copy the entire runtime and flash memory out.  Others may manipulate the data in transit between the hardware and the internal memories, Smart Card OS, or I/O from/to the card.  Even if hw/fw/sw/compilers are open source, you would have to audit everything at every step and still you could miss something you/everyone else didn't think of.  The paranoia can send you into a white rubber room.\nSorry for running off on a paranoia tangent.  Seriously, take the target drives out to test.  You only have to worry about the target drive hw/fw then.  Better yet, just take out the HDD platters / SSD flash chips to test (assuming your test system is golden). ;)\n\nA: AIDE (Advanced Intruder Detection Envionment) is a replacement to tripwire mentioned in another answer here. From wikipedia: \n\nThe Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) was initially\n  developed as a free replacement for Tripwire licensed under the terms\n  of the GNU General Public License (GPL).\nThe primary developers are named as Rami Lehti and Pablo Virolainen,\n  who are both associated with the Tampere University of Technology,\n  along with Richard van den Berg, an independent Dutch security\n  consultant. The project is used on many Unix-like systems as an\n  inexpensive baseline control and rootkit detection system.\n\n\nFunctionality\nAIDE takes a \"snapshot\" of the state of the system, register hashes, modification times, and other data regarding the files defined by the administrator. This \"snapshot\" is used to build a database that is saved and may be stored on an external device for safekeeping.\nWhen the administrator wants to run an integrity test, the administrator places the previously built database in an accessible place and commands AIDE to compare the database against the real status of the system. Should a change have happened to the computer between the snapshot creation and the test, AIDE will detect it and report it to the administrator. Alternatively, AIDE can be configured to run on a schedule and report changes daily using scheduling technologies such as cron, which is the default behavior of the Debian AIDE package.2\nThis is mainly useful for security purposes, given that any malicious change which could have happened inside of the system would be reported by AIDE.\n\nSince the wikipedia article was written the then current maintainer Richard van den Berg (2003-2010) has been replaced by a new maintainer Hannes von Haugwitz from 2010 to present.\nThe AIDE homepage states Debian is supported which means the application can be installed in ubuntu with the predicatable:\nsudo apt install aide\n\nAs far as portability and USB pen drive support the homepage goes on to say:\n\nIt creates a database from the regular expression rules that it finds\n  from the config file(s). Once this database is initialized it can be\n  used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several message\n  digest algorithms (see below) that are used to check the integrity of\n  the file. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked for\n  inconsistencies. It can read databases from older or newer versions.\n  See the manual pages within the distribution for further info.\n\nThis implies to me you could have the signature database on your pen drive along with the application on live USB persistent storage. I'm not sure AIDE suits your needs but as it's a replacement to tripwire your current favorite it bears looking into.\n", "Q: Unable to start react-native application on ubuntu 12.04 I have just started learning react-native on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine with 4GB RAM i3(5th gen) processor.

What /etc/passwd.lock does? \nAnd what I understood after looking into the documentations on ubuntu man this file contains users, groups and other applications passwords. Correct me if I am wrong. And why was mysql-server installation dependent on this file?     \n\nA: You're on the right track, but not really there yet. The file you read about is the /etc/passwd file, not the /etc/passwd.lock file. /etc/passwd defines which user accounts are available on you machine, which group(s) they belong to and other things. Many, many years ago /etc/passwd also contained the account's passwords. But for security reasons those were relocated into the so called \"shadow password system\" (which is essentially another file with stricter permissions). \n/etc/passwd.lock is, as the name suggests, a lock file. Lock files are meant to indicate that a ressource is used by somebody else at the moment and therefore isn't available for you. Lock files are quite common, they've even got a default directory to store them into, /var/lock. \nBack to /etc/password: This file and many other files are essentially text files and you technically can edit them with any text editor. But you really shouldn't, because if you mess up, you can do a lot of damage with a simple typo. Therefore, there's a bunch of tools to edit those central configuration files that at least try to prevent the largest mistakes.\nTo edit the /etc/passwd and some other files, you should use the vipw command. On of the things that vipw does is that it locks the corresponding file. That's to make sure that no two users or applications are editing the config file at the same time. So if you edit a user account with vipw, the command creates the /etc/passwd.lock lock file, to indicate that /etc/passwd isn't available for changes at the moment. Then it applies the changes and deletes the lock file to lift the lock.\nIn your case something seems to have gone wrong and the lock file wasn't removed, for whatever reason. So, when you tried to install the MySQL server, it couldn't edit /etc/passwd, because the lock file essentially told it \"this ressource is in use, try again later\". \nFinally, what does the MySQL server have to do with /etc/passwd? One of the basic concepts of Unix and therefore Linux systems is that they're multi-user systems. There are multiple user accounts, which have different permissions (it's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it). You probably already know about the root account and your user account. But on a typical system, there are quite some more accounts \"under the hood\". On the machine I'm writing this on, which is basically a vanilly Ubuntu desktop installation, /etc/passwd defines 42 user accounts.\nGenerally, different accounts are used to shield stuff from people who aren't meant to mess with it, or to define who can use something and who can't. The MySQL server is executed under its own mysql account, and many other services and daemons (web servers, mail servers etc.) do something similarily.\nSo, to sum things up, your scenario was as follows: The installation process for the MySQL tried to add its mysql account to /etc/passwd, but the existence of the lock file told it that it couldn't do that at the moment.\n", "Q: video player issue on ubuntu 16.04 on my desktop pc How can i install vlc media player or other softwares on my pc in which have installed the ubuntu 16.04.\nIn windows and other os, we can see the video player softwares are installed in default.

I guess such file has to be exposed to a system (in snappy parlance) and writeable by system users (root).\n\nA: What I'm generally doing is having the software reading multiple files:\n\n\n*\n\n*user configuration\n\n*global configuration\n\n*default configuration\n\n\nEach keys (like if it's yaml or json, or just key-value pair) that are upper on the stack overrides the ones below.\nThat way, you can ship your default configuration in $SNAP, if the user set a global configuration, he can tweak (or copy) in $SNAP_DATA with the same file name. and same at user's level with $SNAP_USER_DATA`.\nNote that you can ship a configuration app as part of your snap to scaffold your configuration files.\n\nA: There is a writable directory for your snap, that the snap can read and write files in. I would suggest you make an etc/ subdirectory of that for this config file. It may be necessary to provide a wrapper that invokes the editor and gives it access to that file.\n", "Q: What is post-install equivalent in snap packages? I need to run a command to initialize environment for an application. This needs to happen just once when snap package is installed.\nDEB packages provide post-install script that serves this and many other purposes like setting up application specific user accounts and such.\nSo, what is DEB's post-install script equivalent in snap packages?\n\nA: There is no post* script on purpose (to ensure that you have transactional updates).\nSome hooks system though would be released very soon in snapd itself to enable you achieving this. It's not available yet at this date though, but you can use $SNAP_DATA file flag to make your daemon wait until the user file up the configuration (via another command from the same snap for instance).\n\nA: You can configure the environment for the application in a launcher script that does it just before starting the application.\nWhat @didrocks says is that you can create a hidden flag file in $SNAP_DATA folder to know if the application has been launched previously or not.\nFor instance, you can have a bash script in $SNAP/bin/myapp-launcher.sh that performs:\n#!/bin/sh\n...\nif [ ! -e \"$SNAP_DATA/.flag_file ]; then\n  <configure the app>\n  touch $SNAP_DATA/.flag_file\nfi\n...\nexec \"<command of your app>\" \"$@\"\n\nand in snapcraft.yaml configure that app to be started by calling its launcher, like\n...\napps:\n  myapp:\n    command: bin/myapp-launcher.sh\n...\n\n", "Q: QCA6174 not working in Ubuntu 16.04 after running upgrade yesterday I already had a problem with this before, and I was able to get it working using the drivers from: github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/tree/master/QCA6174.\nBut after running Ubuntu upgrade (yesterday) I can't get the wifi connection anymore, I created a pastebin with the log of this here.\nI have tried replacing the firmware again both with the kvalo and the FireWalkerX fork, with no result.\nI also tried upgrading the linux-firmware:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-firmware_1.158_all.deb\n\nI'v also created a pastebin with the output of the wireless-info script recommended in the Ubuntu Forums, here it is.\nsudo ethtool -i wlp5s0\ndriver: ath10k_pci\nversion: 4.5.2-040502-generic\nfirmware-version: WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1\nexpansion-rom-version: \nbus-info: 0000:05:00.0\nsupports-statistics: yes\nsupports-test: no\nsupports-eeprom-access: no\nsupports-register-dump: no\nsupports-priv-flags: no\n\nlspci -nnk | grep 0280 -A2\n05:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [168c:003e] (rev 32)\n\nsudo rfkill list all\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\n\nA: I got it working with the help of a guy from Ubuntu Forums, here.\nHere is the code:\nsudo rm /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/*\nsudo wget https://github.com/FireWalkerX/ath10k-firmware/blob/7e56cbb94182a2fdab110cf5bfeded8fd1d44d30/QCA6174/hw3.0/board-2.bin?raw=true /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/board.bin\nsudo wget https://github.com/FireWalkerX/ath10k-firmware/blob/7e56cbb94182a2fdab110cf5bfeded8fd1d44d30/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-4.bin_WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1?raw=true /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/firmware-4.bin\n\nAnd reboot.\nNote that you need to download the board-2.bin and rename it to board.bin.\n", "Q: Is there a way to control whether daemon should be started on snap install command? I believe it is a default behavior of snap install command to start daemons when a snap package is installed for the first time and made available to a system.\nIn my particular case I would rather not have it run automatically and let the user decide when they want to start the daemon.\nSo, is there a way to control whether daemon is run on snap install?\n\nA: Not that I know of.\nYou can do that manually with the systemctl enable or disable commands with the generated .service file in /etc/systemd/system/.\nYou can as well have a wrapper script which is checking for a file in $SNAP_DATA and block until this one has some desired value, blocking thus the service to start until configured for example.\nAnother way to look at it (if your snap only ship this service), is why would people install a snap to have it not running?\n", "Q: Firefox not launching, Ubuntu 16.04 I installed firefox using the default applications installer.

I have seen many tutorials that use a -- after commands. Something like this:\ncommand -- \n\nWhat does this -- mean?\n\nA: The -- is used to indicate the end of command line options. This enables you to use arguments starting with --. For example, if you create a file called --foo:\n$ > '--foo'\n$ ls\n--foo\n\nAnd then try to delete it, rm will think you're giving it an argument:\n$ rm --foo \nrm: unrecognized option '--foo'\nTry 'rm ./--foo' to remove the file '--foo'.\nTry 'rm --help' for more information.\n\nOne way around this is to use --:\n$ rm -- --foo\n\nThis is common practice and recommended by POSIX, so it's supported by many programs.\n\nA: Most commands will use a -- to tell the command that further parameters should be treated differently. One example is the rm -- --filename noted above. Another example, a script like 'startx' will interpret itself everything before -- , and pass everything after it to the X server.\n", "Q: Cannot find other disk partitions after installing Ubuntu My PC was running on Windows 10.

I can see root directory only. NTFS 3G driver is already installed on my system. How can I find other drive and access my files\n\nA: Since you used the option to Erase disk and install Ubuntu, all your previous partitions got erased and the current one was created.\nYou can try installing and using testdisk and see what you can recover but I wouldn't be very optimistic unfortunately.\nIn cases where you need to keep some of your partitions, you must use the Something else option and handle partitioning manually.\n", "Q: Map network drive to Win7 share from Ubuntu To start, I am a complete novice to Ubuntu, and have used Windows exclusively essentially up until a few weeks ago.

The reason for doing this was because I originally had a Sony vaio which has Windows on. I installed Linux on it then wanted to revert back to Windows and read that the way to do it was to restore MBR. So I did this now when I boot I am stuck on a black screen with one line saying \"MBR 1FA:\". I really need help, my laptop has been in this state for a while now. I was told to try and boot from gparted on a live USB but I was getting another error. Can anyone please help me out here\n\nA: @Harvey, that's why I asked you the question above.  Restoring MBR would restore the Windows boot record if you had created a dual boot system, which doesn't seem to be the case.\nIf you want to revert to Windows now, you must boot from the Windows installation DVD and do a brand new Windows installation.  Windows will fix your MBR error automatically.\n\nA: Problem\nRestoring the MBR does not restore the OS.  The OS exists on the partition, and you removed the partition, when you wrote over it with your Ubuntu install. That isn't your only problem though.  According to How Can I Get Recovery Disks for a SONY VAIO Model: PCV-A1111L VPCL111FX/B, which I also linked in the comment, you may or may not have a hard copy of your restore set, because you unknowingly didn't know you needed to create it.  In my Opinion, starting with Windows 8, all PC's contain UEFI, and USB is usable as a restore medium. As such, it now falls upon the end-users to create the restore set. \nSolution\nSince you can no longer create the restore set yourself, you must now buy a pre-made restore set.  I can tell you from personal experience that this works, as I restored an older Dell machine.  There are a couple of online retailers that sell the set you need to acquire:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a Restore Disk - RestoreDisks.com\n\n*Main Page - RecoveryDisks.com\n", "Q: How to get genymotion in Ubuntu 14.04 I want to install Genymotion in Ubuntu 14.04 but I can't seem to find out how.

Post yr feedback as a comment below if you have doubts or if you think my assumptions are misguided.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 freezes after 15 to 20 seconds of use I have just installed Ubuntu desktop 16.04 on my flash drive (bootable flash drive option).\nUbuntu keeps freezing after ~20 seconds of activity like going onto firefox etc....\nThe only way to get out of it is to hard-boot the computer (shut it down via the power button). \nUbuntu is installed on a 8 gig flash drive.\nMy specs match the system requirements to run Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Celeron CPU J1800 @ 2.41 GHz, 2 cores, 2 logical processors.\n\n*x64 based PC\n\n*3.9 GB of system memory\n\n*Intel HD Graphics\n\n\nAs far as I can see, I pass all the prerequisites needed to run Ubuntu.\nIs there a certain driver I need to install to connect Intel HD Graphics to Ubuntu? Do we even need a graphics card to run Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: I have found some evidence that your processor is affected by the c-state bug which causes total freezes when the CPU tries to enter an unsupported sleep state. It's a problem for many Bay Trail devices especially with newer kernels.\nThere is a simple workaround for this until it gets properly fixed upstream. You just need to pass a kernel boot parameter and the random freezing stops completely (so if you still get freezes after doing this, you will know your problem is something else)\nYou do this by editing the configuration file for GRUB:\nBoot Ubuntu and open a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t then type\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nThis needs to be changed to include intel_idle.max_cstate=1\nSo after your edit it reads\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_idle.max_cstate=1\"\n\nIf you have other boot parameters already besides quiet and splash, just leave them alone.\nNow save the file by pressing ctrl+o then enter and exit by pressing ctrl+x\nNow type\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen reboot\n\nWhat to do if you don't have enough time to do this before the system hangs\nNo problem. As explained on the help page I linked to earlier, you can add the parameter to GRUB before booting. Note that this only passes the parameter for this boot, so you still have to edit /etc/default/grub once you have booted to make the change permanent.\nYou need to get to the GRUB menu. If you are dual booting this will appear anyway, if not you have to press and hold (or tap) shift after pressing the power button to turn on.\nWhen you get to this screen press e and you will go into edit mode, looking vaguely like this\nMove the cursor down to where it says quiet splash, put a space after splash and carefully type intel_idle.max_cstate=1 making sure there is a space after it as well. Now press F10 or ctrl+x to boot.\n", "Q: lsusb finds flash drive, fdisk doesn't I have a Kingston 64gb USB flashdrive that isn't working.\nWhen I use the command lsusb I get the following: '\nBus 002 Device 021: ID 0951:1665 Kingston Technology Digital DataTraveler SE9 64GB\n\nSo it finds my Kingston flasdrive.

Further Difficulty reconnecting I'm brand new to Linux and I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I like it but I am having serious wifi issues. \nMost of the time when I boot up, WiFi connects to my home network automatically and works fine. After anywhere between 30 seconds and ten minutes it disconnects from Wifi and shows the \"gray\" wifi indication in the menu(?) bar in the top right. At this point, when I open the networking menu it still shows my network with strong signal. I select my network again and it attempts to reconnect. This time, it does not work again, the wifi indicator likes like a white outline of a slice of pie, and my network is shown in the networking menu but the signal indicator is gray and empty. If I turn off wifi and turn it on again, the wifi says \"device not ready\" and requires a reboot. \nAfter rebooting, sometimes I am still unable to connect to wifi, but usually it fixes things for a few minutes only for the problem to begin again. \nIn windows 10 wifi works fine, and ethernet works in ubuntu as well. Here is the wifi script that I hope is helpful. http://pastebin.com/N9tr8FcZ\nI have looked on the other questions but most of them seem to be on 14.04 or they differ in what happens in the networking menu after losing wifi. \nI tried downloading a different driver.

I enjoyed playing Sonic Adventure DX but when I tried to play Sonic adventure two after installing the components XACT and dotnet20 from playonlinux the game worked fine ... however there was no sound effects. I reckon it is either something gone wrong in either the program configuration, my computer setup or the games local files. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Well I finally solved the problem. It turns out that it doesn't work properly if you install it through playonlinux. To solve this issue, it requires you to install Steam and Sonic Adventure 2 manually with WINE. \n!!!WARNING: This tutorial will only work with a WINE version 7.46 or greater!!!\nFirstly, open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T create the wineprefix folder with mkdir /home/$USER/.local/wineprefixesand then create a clean WINE prefix with the following command:\nWINEPREFIX=\"/home/$USER/.local/share/wineprefixes/[name for the wineprefix]\" winecfg\n\nThis will create your wineprefix and then open the configuration panel for that wineprefix. make sure that Windows Version is set to Windows XP. Close that Window and then run winetricks from start menu. Download the applications dotnet20 and xact (That is the component that gets the sound to work) through yourwineprefix => install a Windows DLL or Component. After you have installed each component, click cancel two times to close winetricks. Then you want to install the Steam install package here. Next in the termianl cd to the directory containing the file and run:\nenv WINEDEBUG=\"fixme-all\" WINEPREFIX=\"/path/to/your/wineprefix\" wine msiexec /i SteamInstall.msi\nLog into your Steam after it has finished updating and install Sonic Adventure 2 normally (you might want to close the terminal running in the backround). From there the game should play normally with the sound effects :). \nNotes:\nIf your computer is any better than my generic Intel then the game should run perfectly. If not then the game would be running in slow motion. I am yet to solve this, and hope that its just my computer.\nEDIT: Turns out it may or may not have anything to do with the computer. It turns out that its either a glitch with the FPS or something to do with the graphics card (But why would I need a new graphics card for a game that is 11 years old!). Either way, it is still as slow...\nFor more information, visit the following links:\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=19444\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=27139\n", "Q: Using source command to replace bash string with field array I've programmed in other languages but bash and unix in general are very new to me.

I flip it back\nand the change remains.\nSimilarly when when the color temp changes back to normal I can see the change only after flipping the screen.\nThus a very crude work around is to execute:\nxrandr -o left;   xrandr -o normal\njust after you run redshift.

There is a beta driver, called AMD GPU-PRO, but it's a beta (yes it's redundant, I'm tired :P) and it's limited to very few cards.\nFor now, and probably forever, judging from the way AMD has treated its cards in the past, you are stuck with the open source driver unless you do one of a few things.\nFor one, you can buy a new card. I know you said you can't afford one, but maybe it's time to save up for a cheap NVIDIA. NVIDIA cards tend to be unstable on Ubuntu, but at least they get support for more than two years.\nAnother option is to downgrade. Back up /home/ so you have all your user data and install Ubuntu 14.04. 15.10 is newer, but it's about to reach its end of life, as it isn't an LTS release.\nAnd of course, you could always just pray and wait for a proprietary AMD driver that works on 16.04. Who knows? Maybe some developer will get fglrx running on Xorg 1.18 (v1.18 is what broke fglrx compatibility. Xorg is the display server.).\nHonestly, I would just save up for an NVIDIA card.

I have 2 very cheap desktop computers that both don't have internet adapters I got a adapter for my windows 10 desktop but I don't want to get another for my Ubuntu computer is there a way that I can connect a Ethernet cable between to both to share the WiFi. I have looked tried to connect them and create a bridge and share the connection but it did not work I am new to this so I could have just done it wrong. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: You'd need to get both machines on the same local network (LAN). Once you have that, you can either define one as the default gateway of the other. Or you can just connect both machines to your LAN and use the central networking device as gateway for both.\nBut to create a LAN, it probably won't be enough to just put a cable between them. You'd need some networking device that routes and organizes the data traffic, something like a switch, a hub or a router. Many ISPs offer networking devices (mostly all-in-one router) by default.\n\nA: The easiest way to do it, is using a router.

Nobody can connect to my server - it just doesn't work, connection times out Thanks for the help.\nI can access it through FTP on the LAN easily from another computer. The problem is outside users.\n.\n\nA: You could try changing the port forwarding configuration as suggested by x...\n\n(O)pen the FTP at port 21 local, then use port forwarding in router, map it to port ex: 12345. Then user can connect to your ftp from outside using xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:12345.\n\nThis would circumvent any ISP troubles, but you would have to make sure that the port you choose is not used by any other service. There is a wikipedia page on commonly used ports.\nAlso you can troubleshoot the FTP server with a FTP client, such as FileZilla, from your network and from a separate network such as the Library or a Cafe. \nEven though it is read only, I still would recommend using a more secure way of distributing files, such as a dropbox, google drive, or by using SFTP.\n\nGood Luck! :)\n", "Q: How to disable mouse acceleration in Ubuntu 16.04 I checked through the answers currently available, but none of them seems to disable mouse acceleration permanently.\nxset m 0 0 seems to disable it for a brief moment, but it comes back within minutes.\nHow do I permanently disable mouse acceleration?\n\nA: Simplest way to simple disable the whole mouse acceleration and not modifying it:\nCreate the following file with your editor of choice:\n$ sudo vim /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-mouse-accel-disable.conf\n\nAdd the follow content do remove the acceleration profile:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"mouse\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"AccelerationScheme\" \"none\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: This worked for me on ubuntu 18.04 and it should also work on ubuntu 16.04.\nSince ubuntu uses gnome, that means gnome will sometimes overwrite xorg.conf.d settings.\nGnome uses dconf, which is a \"database\" full of settings that get applied when gnome starts, user logs-in, etc.\nThese settings are here so we(users) don't have to create such settings like 90-mouse.conf,\nand then debug why settings don't work, search for log files. etc.\nPlus the settings will stay the same once gnome will replace xorg with wayland.\nHow to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install dconf-editor sudo apt install dconf-editor\n\n*Open the dconf-editor and go to org -> gnome -> desktop -> peripherals -> mouse\nHere is the setting for accel-profile which tells the computer what kind of mouse acceleration you want.\nYou have these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*default\n\n*flat ( accelerate the mouse with a constant value, aka disable mouse acceleration )\n\n*adaptive\n\n\nTo change the accel-profle setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on accel-profle\n\n*If the option Use default value is set to on turn it off\n\n*Then change the Custom value to flat if you want no mouse acceleration\n\n\nThe settings will be saved automatically.\nMy mouse is still to fast! HELP!\nYou can lower the mouse speed at org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/mouse/speed\nThe value can be between -1 and 1.\n\nA: You can modify certain parameters of the mouse driver permanently, i.e. accross reboots.\nFirst list Xorg input devices.\nResults are for my present machine and will be different in yr case.\nList Xorg session input devices in terminal (CRTL-ALT+T):\n$ xinput --list \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                 id=2 [master pointer (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer       id=4 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad       id=10 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PS/2 Generic Mouse               id=11 [slave pointer (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                id=3 [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard      id=5 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                     id=6 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                        id=7 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                     id=8 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard     id=9 [slave keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP WMI hotkeys                   id=12 [slave keyboard (3)]\n\nSo my mouse is identified by: \"PS/2 Generic Mouse\" and has identifier 11. For you it might be different. \nNext, to list the mouse properties, do in terminal:\n$ xset q | grep -A 1 Pointer\nPointer Control:\n     acceleration:  2/1    threshold:  4\n\nTo experiment with zero mouse acceleration parameters,use:\n$    xset m 0/1 4\n\nYour device may have other parameters values. You can experiment with them until you are satisfied with the result. Doing so with the cli utility xset allows you to tweak the device parameters on the fly, i.e. without restarting the Xorg session. However those settings will not be preserved across reboots. \nYou need to make them persistent (until the next driver or system upgrade), by creating a new file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/. For instance:\n$ cd /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\n\n$ sudo vim 80-mouse-accel-disable.conf\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Set mouse acceleration to zero\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n\n    # Default value of mouse acceleration: 2/1 4\n    # Set AccelerationNumerator to zero to disable\n    Option \"AccelerationNumerator\" \"0\"\n    Option \"AccelerationDenominator\" \"1\"\n    Option \"AccelerationThreshold\" \"4\"\nEndSection\n\n$ sudo chmod 644 80-mouse-accel-disable.conf\n\nThat's it. You can logout and back in or reboot. In principle yr mouse acceleration should be persistently set to 0.\nEDIT:\nAs suggested in one of the comments below, the above may only apply to Ubuntu 14.04 and derived flavors. In later versions the config file syntax and keywords may change slightly, although the general principle of the solution remains valid. See this tip for version 16.04 and (perhaps) later (not tested by me).\n\nA: I'm going to post the solution that worked for me : (Create a configuration file)\nFirstly, you need to create an empty file named 50-mouse-acceleration.conf under /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ \nThis can be done by the command :\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\n\nThen, inside this file you copy the code below :\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"My Mouse\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"yes\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"AccelerationScheme\" \"none\"\n    Option \"AccelSpeed\" \"-1\"\nEndSection\n\nLast thing you need to do, is to replace the the Identifier \"My Mouse\" with the id of your mouse (in quotes). Type \nxinput list\n\nand from the list shown copy the id of the mouse device. You don't have to replace any other line beyond this. \nE.g if your mouse id is 12, the complete code should be like this :\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"12\"\n    MatchIsPointer \"yes\"\n    Option \"AccelerationProfile\" \"-1\"\n    Option \"AccelerationScheme\" \"none\"\n    Option \"AccelSpeed\" \"-1\"\nEndSection\n\nI hope this helps :)\n\nA: GNOME manages mouse acceleration by itself. So not only the xorg settings should be adjusted, but also the gnome ones.\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse accel-profile flat\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 0\n\nAnd you can enjoy CS:GO now :-)\n\nA: The xset command with the given parameters are an unknown option in my 16.04\nIn the Ubuntu software shop there is an installer for Keyboard and mouse.

It will do its magic and leave you with a mountable NTFS drive.\nExample:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda5\n\n\nA: According to Maximum Volume Sizes on microsoft.com:\n\nOne of these limitations is partition tables. By industry standards, partition tables are limited to 2^32 sectors. Sector size, another limitation, is a function of hardware and industry standards, and is typically 512 bytes. While sector sizes might increase in the future, the current size puts a limit on a single volume of 2 terabytes (2^32 * 512 bytes, or 2^41 bytes).\nFor now, 2 terabytes should be considered the practical limit for both physical and logical volumes using NTFS.\n\nThis may be your issue. Your volume is too large and might not be mountable under normal conditions. You may have been able to create that partition on Windows due to increased size limits.\nThat last article was written for Windows 2000, but here's a slightly newer article on this.\nThe point is, partitions larger than 2TB are starting to get support, but not everything works with them yet. I'm not sure if Ubuntu can or cannot support this yet, but you might solve your issue by reducing the size of the partition, splitting it into two maybe.\nI can't test this, because I don't have a large enough drive, but this is my theory.\nEither that or your don't have ntfs-3g installed.\nEdit 1: You may try also increasing your sector size from 512 to 1024 or something larger. That may allow you to have a larger partition size.\n", "Q: Navigating/Exiting command line configuration screens from bash script I'm new to bash scripting and making a initial setup script that I can run to quickly set up a new install. \nWhen installing ddclient\nsudo apt-get install ddclient -y\n\nit opens a command line configuration screen as below\nddclient setup wizard\nHow do I navigate these wizards in my bash script?

What would happen if I use\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\n\nfrom an Ubuntu install running from /dev/sda?\n\nI tried it in a VM, and it appears to correctly have wiped the disk. Will this be the case every time? Is this a secure way to \"wipe\" an Ubuntu install and all data?\nMy question is somewhat inspired by:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I uninstall Ubuntu from a computer?\n\n*How is 'rm -rf /' able to delete all files in the system?.\n\n\nA: Short answer: it'll do roughly what you want and then nothing will work. Using dd you're operating at a level below the filesystem which means that any constraints which would apply there are no longer relevant (this doesn't mean that the kernel couldn't prevent you doing this - but it doesn't). Some content from the filesystem is already in memory, for example the kernel and the dd program itself, and some will be in cache. There is a possibility that if the system is in multi-user mode some files may be written back while the dd is in progress, assuming that they actually have changed, and if you're under memory pressure some pages from there may also get swapped out (they should be encrypted and thus unusable after reboot).\nMost commands you'd issue following this - including reboot - would not be in the cache and so would not work. So if you're in single user mode, it'll do extremely well, if you're in multiuser mode it'll wipe the vast majority of data. Ideally you should do it booted from some other medium (even stopping on the initrd perhaps) so that you can be sure where all the writes are coming from.\nIf you want a secure wipe, this won't do the job because there will still be some traces of the original data remaining if you just zero it. Typically you'd want up to three random writes, which would mean copying from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/zero - much slower but safer. Some may suggest that you use /dev/random which is the device for \"pure\" random data - no pseudo-random - but for this purpose the chance of somebody managing to crack the PRNG seed and successfully mask out the data is essentially negligible.\nIf you're really paranoid, you need to throw the storage device into a furnace so that it demagnetises/discharges.\n\nA: It will as it did in your VM wipe the disk and render your system unusable.\nHowever if you have a sort of 'panic deletion' in mind dd might not be fast enough for that and I'm not sure if there are faster commands or programs providing it in that case.\n\nA: It should work, the running process is held in Ram and does not need the disk.\nI would use a live system running from cd or usb anyway. There is even dban, a specialized live linux for disk wiping.\nOverwriting your disk with zeros is save, but if you are paranoid enough or have legal rules you can overwrite with random data multiple times.\nBe carefull when using ssd overwriting does not guarantee the deletion of all data because of wear leveling.\nIf you use full disk encryption (luks) you do not have  to delete the full disk, deleting the luks header is enough.\n\nA: Actually, the filesystem is still mounted, and some writes are buffered meaning they are still in RAM waiting to be written to the disk. Let's say dd correctly overwrites everything, and just behind it the buffers are getting flushed and some potentially sensitive data is getting written back to the disk. So no, this is not a secure way of wiping a disk.\nYou can avoid this issue by first remounting in read-only mode the root filesystem and any other filesystems that are on the disk (or unmounting them completely, but you won't be able to with the root file system), and then, no more writes should be allowed on the filesystems at all (so no buffers to flush) so your command should be safe now, even though it's still a bad idea in case of panic because it takes a long time.\nIf you want to have some sort of panic delete feature, I suggest encrypting your disk with LUKS (the Ubuntu installer can do that) and then following my answer over on Security Stack Exchange. This involves wiping the cryptheader which is only 2MBs in size and that takes less than a second to overwrite. Then restart the system and the disk encryption keys will be gone from memory, with no ways to restore them since the cryptheader itself is gone as well.\n\nA: I sacrificed a VM using a slightly more advanced usage of dd borrowed and slightly modified from the Arch Wiki pages.\nFirst install a nice progress meter:\nsudo apt-get install pv\n\nAnd then run the 'enhanced' dd command\nsudo openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:\"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null \\\n| base64)\" -nosalt </dev/zero \\\n| pv -bartpes \"$(sudo blockdev --getsize64 /dev/sda)\" \\\n| sudo dd bs=64K of=/dev/sda\n\nThis will leave the disk filled with AES ciphertext. A complete and secure disk wipe? Probably better than your own dd example but nothing is completely safe or guaranteed...\n\nAnd you owe me one VM :)\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arch: Securely wipe disk\n\n*Arch: dd - Advanced Example\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04: cannot turn audio back on I recently changed the settings of my audio driver to play 24 bit / 96 Hz tracks.

I then changed the boot order so ubuntu would come before windows and open GRUB where I could chose between it and windows.\nBut I wanted Windows to boot by default so I installed grub-customizer on my Ubuntu. I don't know how but like an idiot I removed the Windows 10 entry (which I only discovered at the next boot). So now my only way of switching between both OS is to open the Boot Loader and change the OS that should launch first, which isn't very convenient.\nI'd like to know how I could re-enable that entry. I've tried updating GRUB but it didn't change anything (output down below).\nGenerating grub configuration file ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-21-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-21-generic\nAdding boot menu entry for EFI firmware configuration\ndone\n\nI was thinking about reinstalling it but it seemed a bit extreme, I was wondering if there was a smarter way of doing it.\n\nA: The update-grub script will create a new /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. This is the basic configuration file for the GRUB bootloader. However, updating the file is not enough, the relevant files need to be copied to /boot/grub and, depending on your system (probably not, in your case, since you're almost certainly using an EFI system), GRUB might also need to be installed to the master boot record. In any case, you need to also run grub-install. So, run these commands and then reboot:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nImportant: make sure to change /dev/sda to whichever device you have GRUB installed on. You probably have it on /dev/sda since that's the first hard drive. \n", "Q: Sound issue in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS When I first install Ubuntu in my notebook I can heard the sound in both headphone and also in system speaker.

Before question, my question article may have some incorrect content. I am a linux newbie and a newbie developer. \nI have a question regarding linux tcpdump source code. As I know tcpdump is implemented using libpcap.\n\n\n*\n\n*How tcpdump is work? My opinion is that since tcpdump binary executable file is set in PATH. right?\n\n*My main question is that where is tcpdump c source code? I already knew tcpdump library code which is accessible tcpdump homepage tcpdump\n\nI want to see tcpdump real c code containing main function, variable header files. Please let me know the location. \n\nI use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: tcpdump is available in the main repository in Ubuntu.\nTo download the source code of tcpdump:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the repositories enabled for deb-src type packages, for xenial (16.04) add the following to the /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\n\nReplace xenial with your release codename, you can find your release codename by:\nlsb_release -sc\n\n\n*Now update the local package list by synchronizing with the repositories:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install the source code of tcpdump:\napt-get source tcpdump\n\nIt will be downloaded and auto-extracted on the current directory; also no need for sudo unless you don't have write permission on the directory.\nAll the files you need are inside the directory tcdump-<version> e.g. for version 4.5.1 the directory would be tcpdump-4.5.1.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand well your first question, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can find the source on GitHub. As indicated on the developer's site, you can clone the tcpdump GitHub repository using:\ngit clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git\n\n\n*When you compile the code, you will have to decide where you want your executable to reside. Just make sure that it is located somewhere your user PATH variable points to or just modify your PATH to include that location.\nYou can also install it directly from Canonical repo through sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE or sudo apt-get install DEB_PACKAGE or using a GUI if you fancy one... In that case you'll find your binary at /usr/sbin/tcpdump.

The GUI shows up but doesn't display anything:\n\nUnable to show VG because it contains features that are not supported in current version of system-config-lvm.\n\nSo I need to use the command line but not sure if it takes care of the data on the root partition (got a backup of important data). \nCan anybody give me directions on what to do?\n\nA: You need to try LVM terminal mode commands. For that you need to make sure that you have lvm2 package installed.\nYou can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install lvm2\nAfter this you can go through the following URLs and play with LVM.\nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/linux_lvm\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm\nP.S.: Always use display commands first to view the present volume status. Then you can go for create/resize etc commands as per your need. Think twice before you press enter for resize/remove. I always prefer to do some test setups using a different machine with no important data, learn the thing properly and then apply on a machine with valuable data.\n\nA: This may help:\n\n*\n\n*Go to your disk utility.\n\n*Find your hard disk in the list.\n\n*Go to one of the settings menu (the one with the two cogs) and select \"create a new partition\"\n\nNote: I would recommend creating a disk image and downloading it to a bigger disk in case something happens during write.\nAnother note: If there is more than 4 drives, and you disk is in FAT32 format, create a disk image and install on it another hard drive, and format the drive that you want to partition as NTFS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Phone: beep every hour Is there a possibility to make make Ubuntu MX4 phone to beep (make a sound for less then 1s) every hour?\nWhy do I need it? I used to have my watch which beeps every hour and I would like to have such possibility on my phone too.\n\nA: Until there is a true background tasks/triggers/etc. API in Ubuntu itself this is probably not possible. It might hypothetically doable by creating a service that generates a push notification every hour and make your phone beep when it receives it, but I'm not sure if it is possible without adding a custom online account to the system image. Anyway it is kinda crazy idea and would be nothing more then a just-because-I-can solution.\n", "Q: A new Sandisk Ultra usb 3.0 stick reformatted to ntfs stopped working when accidentally full I bought a SanDisk Ultra 16GB 3.0 USB stick, reformatted it to ntfs and \"managed\" to copy too much data on to it. After that it is undetectable in Ubuntu as well as in Windows (10).\nI have tried fdisk and its variants, gparted, mkfs, gpart, testdisk and it is no longer detected. Is there a way to make it work? The files on it are still on the disk I copied from so, just make it work again is enough. No need for file recovery.\nAddition: I tried fdisk -l | grep Disk and when I lost it and still knew the device bound to that stick, I tried to zero it by dd if=/dev/zero of=dev/sdd, which at the time seemed to work but the stick still is undetected.\n\nA: In the terminal, run this command:\nfdisk -l | grep Disk\n\nHopefully, its block device will be listed.\nI will assume it showed at /dev/sdb.\nWarning! Failure to type the correct block device could result in complete data destruction on your computer's internal HDD.\nNext we will wipe it completely:\nsudo dd if=\"/dev/zero\" of=\"/dev/sdb\" #Replace \"of\" accordingly\n\nAfter that, hopefully you'll be able to format it in Gparted.\n\nA: Run the following commands from the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all of your USB devices except for the 16GB USB flash drive that you want to reformat, so you won't get confused about the device name of the USB flash drive later on.\n\n*List all the partitions.\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSearch the results of the command for output that looks like this:\nDisk /dev/sdc: 15729 MB, 15728640000 bytes\n60 heads, 33 sectors/track, 31030 cylinders, total 30720000 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00016288\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *        2048    30719998    15357952    b  W95 FAT32\n\nIf you see something like 15729 MB (16GB) in the output (see the example output above), then that is your 16GB USB flash drive. In this example it is called /dev/sdc. Now open the Disks application from the Dash and check again to make sure that the device name of your 16GB flash drive is the same as what you got from running the command: sudo fdisk -l. \n\n*Create a partition table on the disk of type msdos, sometimes known as Master Boot Record (MBR). \nsudo parted /dev/sdc mklabel msdos\n\nIn this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. I can't stress strongly enough how important it is to verify the device name before running this step! \nWarning: If you type the wrong device name you may overwrite your operating system or another one of your partitions containing important personal files!!! So be careful and check the device name a second time. Open the Disks application and check the device name of your 16GB USB flash drive in Disks. It should be the same device name!!! Now check again! You don't want to accidentally type the wrong device name!\n\n*Add an empty \"primary\" partition, which will hold a FAT filesystem later.\nsudo parted -a none /dev/sdc mkpart primary fat32 0 16384 \n\nOnce again in this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. The command specifies the start point (from 0 MB) to the end point (16384 MB). If the 16GB USB flash drive does not have the full 16384 MB space, parted will adjust it automatically. If the terminal returns a message that the start point can't start at 0 MB and you have to use some other small number close to 0 MB, type Y to accept this. Note the command is creating a single, primary partition on the whole disk.  \nThis newly created partition will have the ID /dev/sdc1. That is because the device name in this example is /dev/sdc and the 1 at the end is because it is the first partition on that device.\n\n*Create a FAT filesystem on the /dev/sdc1 partition by formatting the partition.\nmkfs.vfat -n \"16GBUSB\" /dev/sdc1\n\n/dev/sdc1 is the partition ID from step 4. \"16GBUSB\" is the partition label, which can be your own choice of label, just enclose the label inside two double quote characters.  \nYou now have a ready-to-use reformatted USB flash drive with a 16GB FAT partition. \n", "Q: Problem creating lxc container on BQ M10 I attempted to create an lxc container on my BQ Aquarius M10 as follows:\nlibertine-container-manager create -t lxc -d vivid -i lxc\n\nAfter being asked for and entering my password the following was the result:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/bin/libertine-container-manager\", line 758, in <module>\nargs.func(args)\nFile \"/usr/bin/libertine-container-manager\", line 387, in create\ncontainer = LibertineContainer(args.id)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/libertine/Libertine.py\", line 281, in __init__\nfrom  libertine.LxcContainer import LibertineLXC\nImportError: No module named 'libertine.LxcContainer'\n\nCan anyone explain this? \nJust to note - I am running OTA-11 and ssh'd into my tablet to get around any restricted terminal issues.\n\nA: Usermode LXC is not supported on Linux 3.10, so the LXC back end of Libertine isn't even installed on that device.

The small button \"sticks\" are more likely to contain a micro SD, not soldered to anything.\n\nA: if your pc still sees the usb drive but you can't acces it or change partitions you can fully wipe everything by doing this guide.\nHope I helped\n\nA: I've seen similar failures caused by excessive dust in the USB port.

I need a solution to use Ubuntu with Windows\n\nA: Grub should be able to do this, but you didn't tell it to look for your Windows installation before rebooting.  Fixing your MBR caused it to forget your Ubuntu, so in some sense you're starting over from the beginning.\nI recently did an alongside install with Windows 7 and got it working, but I don't have UEFI.  Did you do grub-install and grub-update before rebooting out of your Ubuntu install?  If you boot from your Ubuntu USB again you may be able to run those commands against your installed partition.  Otherwise, perhaps just reinstall Ubuntu and then run those commands before rebooting?\nI was able to fix some of my errors using boot-repair.  It can remove grub and reinstall it.

I had to add my ipv6 to my vhost and that solved the problem.\n", "Q: lsattr: Permission denied While reading flags on directory This question is risen from Undeletable directory in lost+found\nI have a directory which I cannot delete and it seems like the reason of that is wrong attrbiutes ('immutable' on that dir or 'append only' on the parent one or something like that), but I cannot even list permissions of that dir:\n/tmp/2 sudo lsattr\nlsattr: Permission denied While reading flags on ./#1589030\n\nHow is it possible and what could be the reason?\nUPDATE\nIn the original question, there were steps to reproduce:\ncd /tmp\nwget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22701362/broken.tar.xz\ntar xvf broken.tar.xz\nmkdir test\nsudo mount broken.iso test\nsudo lsattr test/2\n\nWhile it was reported that it returns\n---D-ad--j--T--- 2/#1589030 \n\nOn both my machine and my work station in returns:\nlsattr: Permission denied While reading flags on test/2/#1589030\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem on an ext4 filesystem.\nThe solution was: unmount filesystem, use debugfs in interactive mode.  It is similar to a shell and allows to do many operations bypassing all permissions, including deleting files and directories.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu format my hardrive I have been reading and I want to install Ubuntu. I saw it says that it can use all the hard drive and override the other OS. So my question is, will it delete everything in my hard drive and install itself or will it delete my OS only?\n\nA: Yes, if -you- tell the installer to overwrite an OS it will format anything related to that OS. So, assuming Windows, C:, D:, E: and any other drive letters.\nIf the other OS is Ubuntu it will delete all partitions related to the OS.\nIf you have create \"unallocated space\" from the OS you use now you can use that to \"install alongside\" and you will have the new OS together with another OS. That will not delete your old OS. \n\nAs with any action that involves changing the disk layout: make a backup of your important files on any of the operating systems. It is even better to have a regular backup schedule. \n", "Q: How can I make Ubuntu always recognize my external monitor on the left side? Every time I turn on my laptop and plug in my external monitor via HDMI, I need to go to the display settings to adjust the default settings. On start-up, I get a duplicated screen instead of the extended screen that I want. I also get my external monitor on the right when I always put it on the left. How can I make it so that by default it stays extended and on the left? Yes, I always put \"apply\" and \"keep this configuration\", but it seems to reset on startup.\nxrandr output with the monitor set up exactly how I want:\nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3520 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767\nLVDS1 connected primary 1600x900+1920+180 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 382mm x 215mm\n   1600x900      60.01*+  40.03  \n   1440x900      59.89  \n   1368x768      60.00  \n   1360x768      59.80    59.96  \n   1152x864      60.00  \n   1280x720      60.00  \n   1024x768      60.00  \n   1024x576      60.00  \n   960x540       60.00  \n   800x600       60.32    56.25  \n   864x486       60.00  \n   800x450       60.00  \n   640x480       59.94  \n   720x405       60.00  \n   640x360       60.00  \nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP-1-4 disconnected\nHDMI-1-4 disconnected\nHDMI-1-5 connected 1920x1080+0+0 510mm x 287mm\n   1920x1080     60.00*+  50.00    59.94  \n   1920x1080i    60.00    50.00    59.94  \n   1280x1024     75.02    60.02  \n   1280x960      60.00  \n   1280x800      59.91  \n   1152x864      75.00  \n   1280x720      60.00    50.00    59.94  \n   1024x768      75.08    70.07    60.00  \n   832x624       74.55  \n   800x600       72.19    75.00    60.32    56.25  \n   720x576       50.00  \n   720x480       60.00    59.94  \n   640x480       75.00    72.81    66.67    60.00    59.94  \n   720x400       70.08  \n  1024x768 (0x55) 65.000MHz -HSync -VSync\n        h: width  1024 start 1048 end 1184 total 1344 skew    0 clock  48.36KHz\n        v: height  768 start  771 end  777 total  806           clock  60.00Hz\n  800x600 (0x59) 40.000MHz +HSync +VSync\n        h: width   800 start  840 end  968 total 1056 skew    0 clock  37.88KHz\n        v: height  600 start  601 end  605 total  628           clock  60.32Hz\n  800x600 (0x5a) 36.000MHz +HSync +VSync\n        h: width   800 start  824 end  896 total 1024 skew    0 clock  35.16KHz\n        v: height  600 start  601 end  603 total  625           clock  56.25Hz\n  640x480 (0x62) 25.175MHz -HSync -VSync\n        h: width   640 start  656 end  752 total  800 skew    0 clock  31.47KHz\n        v: height  480 start  490 end  492 total  525           clock  59.94Hz\n\n\nA: Work around\nScreen layouts that do not stick often happens when the graphics driver and the sreen somehow do not communicate in a sufficient way. However, that does not mean there is no solution.\nThe command to make your setup as you want it, is (if I made no mistake or typo):\nxrandr --output HDMI-1-5 --pos 0x0 --output LVDS1 --pos 1920x180\n\nWHy this is the command to do so is explained a.o. here.\nHow to use\nYou can use this command in two ways:\n1. Manual version (shortcut)\nAdd it to a shortcut key to press once the second screen is connected: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\nxrandr --output HDMI-1-5 --pos 0x0 --output LVDS1 --pos 1920x180\n\n2. Automaic version\nRun this command automatically if the second screen is connected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as set_screen.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef numscreens():\n    scrdata = subprocess.check_output(\"xrandr\").decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n    return len([l for l in scrdata if \" connected\" in l])\n\nnscr1 = None\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    nscr2 = numscreens()\n    if nscr2 != nscr1:\n        if nscr2 == 2:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", \"HDMI-1-5\", \"--pos\", \"0x0\",\n                              \"--output\", \"LVDS1\", \"--pos\", \"1920x180\"])\n    nscr1 = nscr2\n\n\n*Test run the script by running it from a terminal:\npython3 /path/to/set_screen.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 30 && python3 /path/to/set_screen.py\"\n\n", "Q: Date off by years - Cannot set date Update: Please find a little how to solve it at the end of the question!\n=========================================================\nI cannot set date to the correct time:\nroot# date\nMi 16.

Locate a reference file reffile with the correct timestamp:\nfind / -cnewer /reffile | xargs touch\n\nIt runs for some time. Reboot afterwards and erverything should work.\n\nA: If you're synchronizing your local time to a timeserver with NTP, the problem might be that your changes get \"re-adjusted\" to what the time server \"thinks\" is correct.\nCheck the date and time setting in your GUI, for KDE that should be System Settings/Date & Time. Maybe you're using a time server that's somehow \"off\", and choosing another one might solve your problem. Also check if the time zone settings are correct.\nAdditionally, you can use\nntpdate -d\n\non the command line to get some debugging information. ntpdate is a command line ntp client. The -d switch activates the debugging mode. In that mode, ntpdate will fetch the information from the server, but not adjust the local time. Additionally, it will print useful information for general debugging. If ntpdate -d tells you that not servers can be used, but there should be at least one (e. g. defined in the GUI), try ntpdate-debian -d. Not sure why there are two binaries, but the latter works in Ubuntu, not sure about Kubuntu.\nntp is a time server daemon. The idea behind using it on a (not specific NTP-)server is expressed well in the Ubuntu documentation:\n\nThe ntp daemon ntpd calculates the drift of your system clock and continuously adjusts it, so there are no large corrections that could lead to inconsistent logs for instance. The cost is a little processing power and memory, but for a modern server this is negligible. \n\nIn your case you should consider it mostly because depending on the configuration of ntpdate, it might use ntps lists of available time servers instead of its own (see NTPDATE_USE_NTP_CONF in /etc/default/ntpdate).\nWith this information, you should be able to poke around and find out what's happening, if your problem is NTP related.\n\nA: Many ways.. for instance\n sudo date MMDDhhmmyyyy.ss\n # sudo date 02021411971.59\n\nor you can do it this way\n sudo date --set=\"2016-07-02 13:12:59.990\"  && date --rfc-3339=ns\n\nor you can simplysynchronize like this\nntpdate -s ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nand finally change the timezone like this\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\nGot it from here & Happy Time Setting \n", "Q: mkdir says that file exists when it doesn't When I run \nmkdir ~/.ipython/extensions/\n\nI get \nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/droudy/.ipython/extensions/’: File exists\n\nHowever when I navigate to /home/droudy, there is no .ipython folder or anything resembling that\n\nA: By default, file management tools, such as ls, dir, or even the graphical file manager, don't show hidden files or directories (those where the name begins with a dot, e.g. .ipython). This is why mkdir is telling you that it already exists, even though you cannot see it by using ls or the file manager.\nTo see hidden files, you can use ls -a (From the ls manpage : \"-a, --all do not ignore entries starting with .\"), or, in the graphical file manager (nautilus), press Ctrl + H to show hidden files and directories.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 on MacBook Pro 2014 - 'iucode-tool 1.5.2-1' should I install it? I have a MacBook Pro 2014 which runs an i7 processor.  Could someone please elaborate on what this package does (I understand it allows loading microcode into the processor but nothing else) and whether, or under what circumstances, it should be installed?\n\nA: iucode-tool should be installed together with the intel-microcode package.  It is (automatically) used by the intel-microcode package to update the initramfs.\nintel-microcode has the microcode update data for hundreds of Intel processors, and iucode-tool is used to copy only the data that is needed by a specific processor into the initramfs so that the kernel can load it during early boot.\niucode-tool is also used to build the intel-microcode binary packages from several Intel data files included in the intel-microcode source package.\nNormal users should always install the intel-microcode package to increase system stability.  This will also install the iucode-tool package as a dependency, since the intel-microcode package needs it.\n", "Q: Media keys on Macbook Pro and i3 I have just configured Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro (June '15), and I have put i3 on it.

When I click on the Download as text link on the Ubuntu Pastebin it requires me to login to Ubuntu One. Why? I would like to grab the text with curl.\n\nA: The reasoning behind requiring a login is described in bug 784485. From the link:\n\nThis is being marked as won't fix, because this is a feature, not a bug. The pastebin was being abused as a way to host objectionable content, iirc and this feature was implemented to stop that.\n[...]\nRalph, sadly, you are right. It is unfortunate that the abuse made us limit the features. There are other services that allow what you need. It is probably best to use that.\n\nSo the Ubuntu Pastenbin was being used by spammers and such, which is why it now requires a login in order to view the plaintext.\nThe only alternative would be to use a different pastebin service, or somehow extract the desired text from the HTML version (Using e.g. grep or sed).\n", "Q: Disable root for a group I have a server and I would like to have it where a group called client can't access sudo/su/root. How do I do that? I know to use the visudo command.\n\nA: You might want to think about why the members of the 'client' group can access root privileges in the first place. \nAs far as sudo is concerned, those user's privileges are defined in the sudoers file, that you can edit with visudo (provided you have the neccessary privileges yourself). The sudoers file can be seen as a whitelist: Only those privileges defined in the sudoers file are granted. \nSo you'd have to check which part of your current sudoers file grants users in the group 'client' sudo privileges, and then revoke or rework those. But be careful, it's easy to lock yourself out if you're revoking to much ;)\nAs far as su is concerned, to use that command to gain root privileges a user needs to know the root account's credentials (e. g. its password). If your 'client' user know your server's root password, there's only one thing you can do: Change the root password, and never tell it anybody who doesn't positively has to know it again ;) \n", "Q: No Sound on Firefox or Chrome, Kubuntu 16.04 Amarok works fine, system sounds, local videos... but I get no sound in Firefox or Chrome on Youtube.

No amount of turning off/on the monitor or unplugging the HDMI cable will restore it.\nI tried some of the steps from this guide and found the exact same issue when booted into \"runlevel 3\", which boots into a console instead of X.

We had HDMI-HDMI, thunderbolt-HDMI, and DP-HDMI. We put it down to the LG monitors we had but the behaviour was like when you connect to a TV using HDMI and once the monitor doesn't get HDMI signal it just shuts-off. So, yes it is HDMI specific as you say. We resolved this by using converters(and cables) and connecting the monitors using the DVI inputs on the monitors and now the displays don't shutdown.\n\nA: With a suitable cable, you can connect an HDMI monitor to a DisplayPort output and it will work fine.

I did some research and most examples show the setup through the GNOME Online Accounts. It looks straightforward, but my issue is after I've setup my Google Account with GNOME Online Account, I only see possible sync in applications I don't care about. Essentially I would like to sync Nautilus with Google Drive and Calendar.\nAnyone knows why I'm only seeing a subset?\nGNOME Calendar is installed on my machine. I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\n\n\nA: GNOME Calendar, Maya, and many other Gtk+ calendars use Evolution data server as their backend. If you first install Evolution, then you can  use it to configure your CalDAV calendars (such as iCloud, Yahoo!, and Google) and other accounts.\nIt’s very unfortunate that neither Ubuntu Online Accounts nor GNMOE Online Accounts expose standard protocols such as CalDAV and CardDAV and rather choose to focus on some partner service providers such as Google.\n\nA: FYI, I resorted in installing Evolution and set up the sync through evolution. It syncs fine now in evolution calendar and I can also see my events directly in the Gnome calendar. I found it a bit odd to have to install a main client to set up a calendar sync, but it does the job.\n\nA: I can confirm that this is still the case.\nBy default, on a new 17.10 installation, both the GNOME Calendar and Contacts apps only look to save things locally.  It's a real pain, because they continue to do that even after you set up your online accounts under settings.  They do not default to the new Google Calendar/Contacts (for example) or even ask if you would like the new Google account to be the default for all contacts and calendar management.\nI had to install Evolution and configure things in there.  Not ideal, given I use Thunderbird for e-mails (IMAP).\nWorth also noting that it seems impossible to use outlook.com calendars or contacts at all.\n\nA: The root of the issue in my experience with this problem is that Google was blocking a 'less secure app' and I had to manually go in and change setting in my Google account to allow Evolution access to the account. \n\nA: I solved this one. Look on the left. There are a number of events, groups, and calendars to choose from. If you are on yourname@google.com and that is the calendar you want to sync to, it will work. If you have another calendar highlighted, you will receive and error. \nI found a column on the left in Evolution with a list of accounts for the calendar. I had something checked, changed it to the Google email address and everything was fine. Except for the fact when I add or update an appointment, a popup tells me it could not be updated, but when I close that down without saving, the new or changed appointment shows up on my phone with the calendar. \n", "Q: How to get Plymouth working with LUKS encryption after NVIDIA driver installation? When I first set my computer up with LUKS encryption, during boot, right after Grub2, Plymouth takes over and you get a nice graphical screen with the prompt to enter the passphrase. And that screens remain until the Ubuntu desktop opens.\nOnce I installed the NVIDIA driver for my video card, that graphical screen is gone, and right after Grub2, there is a text screen for passphrase entry, then once decryption takes place, the NVIDIA logo comes up. And on shutdown/restart, it also dumps into a text screen.\nI've seen some solutions on fixing Plymouth after an NVIDIA driver is installed, but not sure if that works with LUKS encryption, and I don't want to risk screwing things up and not being able to decrypt the partition.\nThis is for Xubuntu 14.04.4\n\nA: This worked: How to fix plymouth (splash screen) in all Ubuntu releases!\nThe mistake I made when I first tried it is not using the correct resolution. I used the native resolution of my monitor, 1600x1200. But apparently Grub and Plymouth can have a different max resolution than the monitor and video card.\nSince hwinfo is not available on Ubuntu 14.04, I booted into Grub2, dropped to command line and ran vbeinfo. Max resolution listed was 1280x800x32.\nSo with that info, the solution is:\nsudo apt-get install v86d\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nFind this line:\n#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480\n\nleave commented out and add:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x800x32 (use max resolution found using vbeinfo)\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nSave file, then in terminal:\necho FRAMEBUFFER=y | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis gave me the 'correct' looking resolution for Plymouth both at startup and shutdown. Everything looks like it did before installing the nvidia driver, apart from a brief flash of the nvidia logo between Plymouth and the desktop launching.\nI think the 'late resume failure' error report is unrelated, as I did not encounter this error report this time around.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Unity Start Icon Location I have been working on an Ubuntu \"Virtual Machine\", kind of a virtual desktop.

If you're trying to install, say, myprogram.deb, you would type into terminal sudo apt-get install myprogram. Sometimes there are other ways (I would suggest using synaptic package manager if possible). If your package exists and you still have a dependency, type into Terminal sudo apt-get install myprogram checkinstall. If you can't find your package, you can install the dependency by hand with sudo apt-get install dependency-goes-here, then try installing your package again.\n\nA: The version of the missing dependency is the problem.  Your app is looking for libwxgtk3.0-0 whereas the one installed on Ubuntu 16.04 is libwxgtk3.0-0v5.  The version your app is looking for is not available in the repos.\nThere are two versions of the package here.  The latest one is the one for vivid.  You can download and install it manually using gdebi and then you can try installing the app you want.\nBefore you proceed though, make sure libwxgtk3.0-0v5 is actually installed.  If not, install that one first and if you face the same problem again, then try the manual installation.\n", "Q: How to install Android-studio? with ppa from official page I tried to install Android studio but I think I got it: wrong wget link or something. \nwget https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/ide-zips/1.5.1.0/android- studio-ide-141.2456560-linux.zip -p /opt/\napt-get install unzip\nunzip android-studio-ide-141.2456560-linux.zip -d /opt\n/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh -y\n./studio.sh\n\n\nA: Run these commands in your terminal\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:paolorotolo/android-studio\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install android-studio\n\nAfter it's isntalled run it by typing studio in Dash (Search)\n", "Q: Can't access nm-applet through Applications menu on 16.04 On 16.04 I can invoke the nm-applet GUI using\nApplications -> System Tools -> System Settings -> Network\n\nHowever, nothing happens when I use this shortcut\nApplications -> Other -> Network\n\nI can see that the daemon is running\n--> ps x | fgrep nm\n 1257 ?

This my very first experience with Ubuntu and I'm very much interested in downloading and trying it , but I only have a dial-up internet connection and am limited to a few hours per day , so how can I download such a big file over many days ?\nIs there anyway I can get a CD ?\n\nA: As an alternative to downloading, you could check local bookstores/newsstands for something like a Linux magazine that comes with a DVD with what you are interested in.\n\nA: Lubuntu 16.04 LTS DVD and Lubuntu 16.04 LTS 16 GB bootable USB stick are available from Shop Linux Online\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu 16.04 LTS DVD - $3.99    \n\n*Lubuntu 16.04 LTS 16 GB USB - $12.99  \n\n\nYou can also check your nearest public library if it has computers that library visitors can use to download files and copy them to removable media.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, downloading via BitTorrent is a very good option, as most torrent clients have good support for resuming downloads et cetera. If you're using Firefox, this very minimal browser extension should probably work well enough for downloading. If you're using a different client (e.g. qBittorrent), you might want to limit the upload bandwidth until you're done so uploading doesn't take up too much bandwith.\nHowever, if you know when your time for internet usage is up, you can also download the ISO using your browser and pause the download and resume downloading the next day. (A download manager might offer more robust support for this, such as the ability to resume downloads even after a system restart etc.)\nThis works well, but with one mayor caveat: the server you're downloading from must support download resumption. (You'll have to try pausing/resuming to find out if it does.)\n\nA: There's a minimal CD that runs about fifty megs, it seems.\nMost first-time Linux users use a graphical user interface (GUI), such as the one installed by default by the normal ISO image. If that's what you want to do, this isn't a direct path to that experience.\nIf, on the other hand, you'd like to start by learning the command-line interface (because you have a book or tutorial to teach you Linux commands, for instance), this should work fine. It'll still take a while, but you should be able to download it in about 4-5 hours, I think. (Assuming 33kbps, which is ~15 MB per hour, that's about 3-4 hours; added an hour just in case.)\nEdit: Changed the link to point to the Lubuntu page, rather than the Ubuntu one.\nFor the following two reasons, I no longer support this proposed solution. Firstly, the Lubuntu page mentions the need for a wired Ethernet connection to the Internet. Unless the modem is elsewhere on your local network (in another computer, say), this solution is probably a no-go. Secondly, per the comments, this doesn't immediately provide you with the full classic Lubuntu command-line experience, which I had assumed it did.\n\nA: In earlier days when I had 56k internet I downloaded the ISO to the school computer, splitted the image into parts and transported it home with my MP3-player. (Some other guy used an extra back-pack full with floppies.) Took some days for me to transport but was faster, more stable and cheaper than with my home connection. As of today there should be USB-sticks where you can store the whole file without splitting.\nDepending on your area you might get some kind of internet connection like internet cafee, McDonalds, schools, libraries, ...\nA good option is to use a torrent client for downloading the linux iso as it contains better support for resuming downloads and auto-correcting failed downloads. Be aware that torrent clients also upload the files you download which might be problematic if you use it to download copyrighted material.\n\nA: If you can stall at a local coffee shop or fast-food restaurant for an hour, you can probably download it in that time.\nIf you have a library nearby, they often have computer you can work on stuff with. You can probably download the iso to a USB in that time.\nLast resort would be to buy a USB-stick with the iso already on it. You can do that at the Canonical Store.\nIf you want to stick with dialup, you can torrent the iso, and it can be downloaded over many days. You can also get the direct link and use wget -c <url of iso>. You can cancel this command and re-run it to -continue the download from where it left off.\n\nA: See if there's a Linux Users' Group (LUG) in your area. My first copy of Linux I got on a CD from a guy at work; a LUG would likely be able to help you get a copy, perhaps in a similar way.\n\nA: First of all, I must admit that I'm very curious. Are you somewhere incredibly rural, with no DSL or similar service available?\nNow, you haven't mentioned what speed dialup you have. At 28.8k, the stock Ubuntu image will take you 113 hours to download; at 33.6k, 97 hours, at 48k, 67 hours, and at 56k 58 hours.\nConsidering that you have restricted Internet access I would recommend downloading as much data and packages as possible so that you can be off and running. I don't think the times I've listed above are that bad, so I strongly recommend this approach.\nAs mentioned in another answer bittorrent is certainly one option, but I keep hearing about people in the US getting harassed for using it. Unlikely to be an issue in your case, but here's another alternative if you'd like one: download the DVD image onto a remote server, split the file up into chunks on that server, then download the chunks from that server individually. If a chunk is corrupt you just redownload that. Ubuntu provides official checksums for their images so you know you got unmodified data.\nYou could also very very viably use this approach if you wanted to try downloading the image via free Wi-Fi.\nI have a server I can use to split the ISO up with if you like this idea (or would like to contact me for any other reason). Find an online base64 decoder and pass it this string (including the ==): YXNtcWI3QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ== (or alternatively open your browser devtools, click Console, and run atob(\"\") with the base64 string inside the quotes). \n\nA: Your best bet is to use something other than ubuntu. For example:\nhttp://tinycorelinux.net/ - 16mb\nhttp://www.damnsmalllinux.org/ - 50mb\nhttp://puppylinux.org/ - 100mb\nEven on a 28.8 Kb dial-up, you should be able to get tiny core linux within two hours, and if you've got 56 Kb available, damn small linux can be downloaded in just a little longer.\n", "Q: Desktops compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 I'm looking to purchase a high-powered desktop that's compatible with 16.04, but the ubuntu certified page only lists one desktop that's certified to work. \nDo any of you have any suggestions for good desktops that I could use with 16.04? I recently converted for my laptop and it's been working really well so I want to try and transition my desktop over too! \nThanks,\n\nA: If you are looking for a high-powered system that is guaranteed to work with Ubuntu (with full support too), I would suggest System 76.

To do that, I'm using No-Ip. I've created an account, selected a hostname, and installed and configured de client in my machine. If I use the ping command with the hostname, I get my IP address, and when it changes , it gets updated as well in the No-IP website. But for some reason, the hostname doesn't point to my server. For example, I can't use it in order to access via SSH from outside of my local network; if I go to the hostname with a browser outside of my local network, my website doesn't load either. \nAny help will be appreciated\n\nA: Is your question about IPv4 or IPv6? Why do you assume that it's your IP(v4) address?\nAt first you should ask your provider if you are allowed to host a server¹ for private use and if that is even possible. Some providers have scenarios where they do NAT for all customers on their side and don't take any effort to make it work like in the old days, so you won't be able to access any service you host. Some other providers will initially NAT every new modem that connects to their network, but lift restrictions for those who need it, i.e. when I reset one of my boxes with its provided modem installation code I'll have to wait a day or so to be able to access my services.  \nOnce you have confirmation that the provider will reserve an IP only for you you can start setting up UFW on your Ubuntu host and port forwarding or exposed hosts on all the routers you may have and probably didn't know about.\nIf you're not 100% sure that you're accessing only your computer via an IP only assigned to you you're doing something which computer illiterate people – among them some judges – call hacking or computer fraud. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of server say you want to configure your gaming console with open or type 1 NAT.\n\n", "Q: Mysql service not starting Ubuntu 16.04 Every time I try to start mysql with sudo service mysql restart it returns\nJob for mysql.service failed because the control process exited with error\ncode.

Here is the /var/lib/alsa/asound.state file, the portion relevant to my usbaudio device:\nstate.USBStreamer {\ncontrol.1 {\n    iface PCM\n    name 'Playback Channel Map'\n    value.0 0\n    value.1 0\n    value.2 0\n    value.3 0\n    value.4 0\n    value.5 0\n    value.6 0\n    value.7 0\n    value.8 0\n    value.9 0\n    comment {\n        access read\n        type INTEGER\n        count 10\n        range '0 - 36'\n    }\n}\ncontrol.2 {\n    iface PCM\n    name 'Capture Channel Map'\n    value.0 0\n    value.1 0\n    value.2 0\n    value.3 0\n    value.4 0\n    value.5 0\n    value.6 0\n    value.7 0\n    value.8 0\n    value.9 0\n    comment {\n        access read\n        type INTEGER\n        count 10\n        range '0 - 36'\n    }\n}\ncontrol.3 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'USBStreamer Output Playback Switch'\n    value.0 true\n    value.1 true\n    value.2 true\n    value.3 true\n    value.4 true\n    value.5 true\n    value.6 true\n    value.7 true\n    value.8 true\n    value.9 true\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type BOOLEAN\n        count 10\n    }\n}\ncontrol.4 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'USBStreamer Output Playback Switch'\n    index 1\n    value true\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type BOOLEAN\n        count 1\n    }\n}\ncontrol.5 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'USBStreamer Output Playback Volume'\n    value.0 255\n    value.1 255\n    value.2 255\n    value.3 255\n    value.4 255\n    value.5 255\n    value.6 255\n    value.7 255\n    value.8 255\n    value.9 255\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type INTEGER\n        count 10\n        range '0 - 255'\n        dbmin -12750\n        dbmax 0\n        dbvalue.0 0\n        dbvalue.1 0\n        dbvalue.2 0\n        dbvalue.3 0\n        dbvalue.4 0\n        dbvalue.5 0\n        dbvalue.6 0\n        dbvalue.7 0\n        dbvalue.8 0\n        dbvalue.9 0\n    }\n}\ncontrol.6 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'USBStreamer Output Playback Volume'\n    index 1\n    value 152\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type INTEGER\n        count 1\n        range '0 - 255'\n        dbmin -12750\n        dbmax 0\n        dbvalue.0 -5150\n    }\n}\ncontrol.7 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'USBStreamer Clock Selector'\n    value 'USBStreamer Internal Clock'\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type ENUMERATED\n        count 1\n        item.0 'USBStreamer Internal Clock'\n        item.1 'USBStreamer TOSLINK Clock'\n    }\n}\ncontrol.8 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'Mic Capture Switch'\n    value.0 true\n    value.1 true\n    value.2 true\n    value.3 true\n    value.4 true\n    value.5 true\n    value.6 true\n    value.7 true\n    value.8 true\n    value.9 true\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type BOOLEAN\n        count 10\n    }\n}\ncontrol.9 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'Mic Capture Switch'\n    index 1\n    value true\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type BOOLEAN\n        count 1\n    }\n}\ncontrol.10 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'Mic Capture Volume'\n    value.0 255\n    value.1 255\n    value.2 255\n    value.3 255\n    value.4 255\n    value.5 255\n    value.6 255\n    value.7 255\n    value.8 255\n    value.9 255\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type INTEGER\n        count 10\n        range '0 - 255'\n        dbmin -12750\n        dbmax 0\n        dbvalue.0 0\n        dbvalue.1 0\n        dbvalue.2 0\n        dbvalue.3 0\n        dbvalue.4 0\n        dbvalue.5 0\n        dbvalue.6 0\n        dbvalue.7 0\n        dbvalue.8 0\n        dbvalue.9 0\n    }\n}\ncontrol.11 {\n    iface MIXER\n    name 'Mic Capture Volume'\n    index 1\n    value 255\n    comment {\n        access 'read write'\n        type INTEGER\n        count 1\n        range '0 - 255'\n        dbmin -12750\n        dbmax 0\n        dbvalue.0 0\n    }\n}\n\nIf I'm reading that correctly it looks like perhaps the relevant audio output channels are muted?  Channels 8 and 9 are the ones relevant for audio output over a Toslink cable, so I suspect I need to modify those values and perhaps I can do a direct ALSA output from mpd. \nStrangely, if I delete asound.state and then re-create it with a \"sudo alsactl store\" command, the channel mapping is completely different:\nstate.USBStreamer {\n    control.1 {\n            iface PCM\n            name 'Playback Channel Map'\n            value.0 3\n            value.1 4\n            value.2 7\n            value.3 8\n            value.4 5\n            value.5 6\n            value.6 12\n            value.7 13\n            value.8 11\n            value.9 9\n            comment {\n                    access read\n                    type INTEGER\n                    count 10 \n                    range '0 - 36'\n            }\n    }\n\nBut it still produces no sound. \nAnother thing I'm considering is that since JACK can play to my usbstreamer, and it is using ALSA, so perhaps I can just figure out what settings its using with ALSA, and duplicate them.   The /proc/asound/card1 directory has the current settings for this card, so I start it playing with jack and mplayer, and read off the files. \nstream0:\nminiDSP USBStreamer at usb-0000:00:14.0-2, high speed : USB Audio\n\nPlayback:\n  Status: Running\n    Interface = 1\n    Altset = 1\n    Packet Size = 280\n    Momentary freq = 44100 Hz (0x5.8330)\n    Feedback Format = 16.16\n  Interface 1\n    Altset 1\n    Format: S32_LE\n    Channels: 10\n    Endpoint: 1 OUT (ASYNC)\n    Rates: 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 176400, 192000\n    Data packet interval: 125 us\n\nCapture:\n  Status: Running\n    Interface = 2\n    Altset = 1\n    Packet Size = 280\n    Momentary freq = 44100 Hz (0x5.8333)\n  Interface 2\n    Altset 1\n    Format: S32_LE\n    Channels: 10\n    Endpoint: 2 IN (ASYNC)\n    Rates: 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 176400, 192000\n    Data packet interval: 125 us\n\nusbbus:\n003/005\n\nusbmixer:\nUSB Mixer: usb_id=0x27520016, ctrlif=0, ctlerr=0\n Card: miniDSP USBStreamer at usb-0000:00:14.0-2, high speed\n  Unit: 10\nControl: name=\"USBStreamer Output Playback Volume\", index=1\nInfo: id=10, control=2, cmask=0x0, channels=1, type=\"S16\"\nVolume: min=-32640, max=0, dBmin=-12750, dBmax=0\nUnit: 10\nControl: name=\"USBStreamer Output Playback Volume\", index=0\nInfo: id=10, control=2, cmask=0x3ff, channels=10, type=\"S16\"\nVolume: min=-32640, max=0, dBmin=-12750, dBmax=0\nUnit: 10\nControl: name=\"USBStreamer Output Playback Switch\", index=1\nInfo: id=10, control=1, cmask=0x0, channels=1, type=\"INV_BOOLEAN\"\nVolume: min=0, max=1, dBmin=0, dBmax=0\nUnit: 10\nControl: name=\"USBStreamer Output Playback Switch\", index=0\nInfo: id=10, control=1, cmask=0x3ff, channels=10, type=\"INV_BOOLEAN\"\nVolume: min=0, max=1, dBmin=0, dBmax=0\nUnit: 11\nControl: name=\"Mic Capture Volume\", index=1\nInfo: id=11, control=2, cmask=0x0, channels=1, type=\"S16\"\nVolume: min=-32640, max=0, dBmin=-12750, dBmax=0\nUnit: 11\nControl: name=\"Mic Capture Volume\", index=0\nInfo: id=11, control=2, cmask=0x3ff, channels=10, type=\"S16\"\nVolume: min=-32640, max=0, dBmin=-12750, dBmax=0\nUnit: 11\nControl: name=\"Mic Capture Switch\", index=1\nInfo: id=11, control=1, cmask=0x0, channels=1, type=\"INV_BOOLEAN\"\nVolume: min=0, max=1, dBmin=0, dBmax=0\nUnit: 11\nControl: name=\"Mic Capture Switch\", index=0\nInfo: id=11, control=1, cmask=0x3ff, channels=10, type=\"INV_BOOLEAN\"\nVolume: min=0, max=1, dBmin=0, dBmax=0\nUnit: 40\nControl: name=\"USBStreamer Clock Selector\", index=0\nInfo: id=40, control=1, cmask=0x0, channels=1, type=\"U8\"\nVolume: min=1, max=2, dBmin=0, dBmax=0\n\npcm0p/info:\ncard: 1\ndevice: 0\nsubdevice: 0\nstream: PLAYBACK\nid: USB Audio\nname: USB Audio\nsubname: subdevice #0\nclass: 0\nsubclass: 0\nsubdevices_count: 1\nsubdevices_avail: 0\n\npcm0p/sub0/hw_params:\naccess: MMAP_INTERLEAVED\nformat: S32_LE\nsubformat: STD\nchannels: 10\nrate: 44100 (44100/1)\nperiod_size: 1024\nbuffer_size: 2048\n\npcm0p/sub0/info\ncard: 1\ndevice: 0\nsubdevice: 0\nstream: PLAYBACK\nid: USB Audio\nname: USB Audio\nsubname: subdevice #0\nclass: 0\nsubclass: 0\nsubdevices_count: 1\nsubdevices_avail: 0\n\npcm0p/sub0/status\nstate: RUNNING\nowner_pid   : 12545\ntrigger_time: 50245.966761737\ntstamp      : 0.000000000\ndelay       : 2010\navail       : 72\navail_max   : 1029\n----- \nhw_ptr      : 325870664\nappl_ptr    : 325872640\n\npcm0p/sub0/sw_params:\ntstamp_mode: NONE\nperiod_step: 1\navail_min: 1024\nstart_threshold: 0\nstop_threshold: 2048\nsilence_threshold: 0\nsilence_size: 0\nboundary: 4611686018427387904\n\nHmm, if the information on channels is in there, it's cleverly hidden!\nVolker Schatz describes setting up an ALSA device to switch channels.  It looks like it's done a different way than just playing around with the playback channel map: \nhttp://www.volkerschatz.com/noise/alsa.html\nThe ttable appears to be a device for channel mixing, and if you use integer entries (0 and 1), for channel switching.   Finally this is starting to make sense.  The i.j notation are pairs coordinates, describing the entries of a square matrix. \nedit: Some progress.  The \"aplay -L\" command gives a list of device names.  For this usbstreamer, it gives:\nsysdefault:CARD=USBStreamer\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nDefault Audio Device\nfront:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nFront speakers\nsurround21:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n2.1 Surround output to Front and Subwoofer speakers\nsurround40:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n4.0 Surround output to Front and Rear speakers\nsurround41:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n4.1 Surround output to Front, Rear and Subwoofer speakers\nsurround50:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n5.0 Surround output to Front, Center and Rear speakers\nsurround51:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n5.1 Surround output to Front, Center, Rear and Subwoofer speakers\nsurround71:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\n7.1 Surround output to Front, Center, Side, Rear and Woofer speakers\niec958:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nIEC958 (S/PDIF) Digital Audio Output\ndmix:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nDirect sample mixing device\ndsnoop:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nDirect sample snooping device\nhw:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nDirect hardware device without any conversions\nplughw:CARD=USBStreamer,DEV=0\nUSBStreamer, USB Audio\nHardware device with all software conversions\n\nThese device names are very handy, from here you can run the command:\nspeaker-test -c 10 -t sin -F S32_LE -D front:USBStreamer\n\nwhich runs through all the speakers on that device.  Channels 8 and 9 (as expected) produce the sin wave sound on the left and right speakers respectively. \nSo I think this means I should be able to get direct ALSA output to my speakers using a ttable construction in asound.state.   I would imagine the Playback Channel Map might allow for this as well, but after quite a bit of fiddling-around with it, it's unclear to me how to make it work. \nupdate:\nI modified the control.1 portion of the asound.state file to be:\ncontrol.1 {\n            iface PCM\n            name 'Playback Channel Map'\n            value.0 0\n            value.1 0\n            value.2 0\n            value.3 0\n            value.4 0\n            value.5 0\n            value.6 0\n            value.7 0\n            value.8 3\n            value.9 4\n            comment {\n                    access read\n                    type INTEGER\n                    count 10 \n                    range '0 - 36'\n            }\n    }\n\nand it almost works.  Mplayer will not play to alsa:device=hw=1.0 but the error message is that I'm sending the wrong format to the device.  ALSA thinks the device only accepts S32LE.  Technically, I think it's an S24LE device.  I'll contact the manufacturer to clear this up. \nSo I add -format s32le to the mplayer command line and stuff comes out of the speakers!   Only, it's a bit of a jumble.  It's playing too fast and. . . something else is going on.  There's some kind of frequency distortion.  I suspect what's happening is it's sending s16le data as if it's s32le data, so there's a bit of a shuffling (temporally) of the data, and a pitch-shift, and it's playing too fast.  \nSo now to get this working I need to know how to convers the s16le data to proper s24le, and then format it as s32le so the usb device is happy. \nupdate:\nspeaker-test -c 10 -t sin -D plughw:USBStreamer\n\nworks fine, and converts S16_LE to S32_LE. \nUnfortunately, \naplay -Dplughw:USBStreamer ./blah.wav\n\ndoes not work.  Perhaps the channel mapping is off for this device? \nThe Deadbeef software  plays to the usbstreamer with little effort.  I give it the hw:USBStreamer device, and tell it to do all 8->16->24 bit conversions and it works like a charm.  \n\nA: Problem solved.  \npcm.usbSTR {\n  type hw\n  card USBStreamer\n  device 0\n}\npcm.usbREMAP {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbSTR\n  ttable.0.8 1\n  ttable.1.9 1\n}\npcm.!default {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbREMAP\n}\nctl.!default {\n  type plug\n  slave.pcm usbREMAP\n}\nMake the above the contents of /etc/asound.conf\nThis file (usually) does not exist in Ubuntu or LUbuntu, but if you create it, the usbstreamer becomes the default ALSA device and the channels are mapped appropriately. \nThis allows you to make the audio_output section of /etc/mpd.conf just the  \"type\" and \"name\" fields, \"alsa\" and \"whatever you want\" respectively. \n", "Q: lubuntu 16.04, 64 bit: Libreoffice 5 crashes desktop session I installed Lubuntu 16.04 on an Acer Extensa 2511, 64-bit\n(then I installed ubuntu-mate-desktop and ubuntu-mate-core).\nWith both lubuntu and MATE, Libreoffice WRITER crashes often, shutting the desktop session down and bringing me back to the login window.\nI tried to reinstall libreoffice; to remove libreoffice and MATE and to install MATE again,; to reinstall jre.

I want to remove the pre-installed ImageMagick from my Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Uninstalling it also removes CUPS and other dependent packages which I want to keep on my system. \nIs there a way to remove only ImageMagick without harming its dependencies or without having to reinstall them after their auto-removal?\n\nA: ImageMagick is a suite of command line tools and libraries for working with images and packages that depend on it or uses parts of it to function.\nCups uses it for its filters and while it's possible that you don't use any filters that use ImageMagick, I'd recommend that you keep it, because removing it may break Cups.\nNow, if you still want to remove it, you can do it like this:\n$ sudo dpkg --purge --force-all imagemagick\n\n\nNote: This will very likely break your system so don't do it!\n\nA: Some functionality of the dependent packages depend on ImageMagick by definition. This means that the dependent packages (cups etc.) have been built in a way that they require (depend on) ImageMagick to complete certain operations.\nSo, without a working ImageMagick, cups built by Ubuntu will not work as intended. To make sure all the installed packages work as intended, apt, dpkg and other system tools make sure the packages with unsatisfied dependencies will be deleted from the system.\nIf you still are certain you don't need ImageMagick on your system, you will have to compile cups and other dependent packages again without linking them against or making them otherwise dependent on ImageMagick. That may or may not be possible using parameters to compilation configuration script (usually invoked by ./configure command). In Ubuntu, maintaining self-built packages is usually not recommended or made particularly easy (you will have to compile the applications again manually to update them, and make sure the applications' dependant packages are compiled again, too).\nThe practical solutions are using a distribution where self-building applications and handling dependencies across them is meant to be easier for the end-user (Gentoo, Arch, etc.), and alternatively keep using Ubuntu without deleting ImageMagick.\n", "Q: No sound on one user account since installing and uninstalling LXDE After I installed and uninstalled lxde with Ubuntu 16.04, I cannot hear any sound in Ubuntu after logging in with my user (at the login screen, it works). \nIt started with (from history | grep apt):\n  149  sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop \n  166  sudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n  167  sudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop && sudo apt install unity\n  168  sudo apt lightdm restart\n  170  sudo apt autoremove \n  172  sudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop && sudo apt install unity\n  176  sudo apt remove lxde-core \n  177  sudo apt remove lxde-common \n  178  sudo apt autoremove \n\nAnd afterwards, the sound was not there anymore (maybe even earlier and I did not recognize). \nAfter some tries (with reboots in between) the sound did not work either:\n  194  sudo apt remove alsa-base \n  195  sudo apt autoremove \n  198  sudo apt-get autoremove pulseaudio\n  199  sudo apt autoremove \n  202  sudo apt install pulseaudio\n  206  sudo apt-get remove alsa\n  207  sudo apt autoremove \n  210  sudo apt-get remove alsa-base alsa-utils\n  212  sudo apt install indicator-sound\n  213  sudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base\n  215  sudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base\n  216  sudo apt-get remove --purge pulseaudio\n  217  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n  219  sudo apt-get install alsa-base\n  220  sudo apt-get install pulseaudio\n  224  sudo apt install indicator-sound\n\nBut when I created a new user and logged in as that one, it worked.

Looks like bootx64.efi itself is GRUB 2.  The configuration file grub.cfg read by bootx64.efi is also stored in ESP.  By default, the grub.cfg in ESP is a configuration to read another grub.cfg in partition where Ubuntu is installed.\n", "Q: How to securely wipe files from SSD drive? When trying to securely wipe SSDs, we have several problems:\n\n*\n\n*SSDs wear out after a limited amount of erase cycles\n\n*SSDs have a controller that dynamically maps LBAs (logical block addresses used by the system to access the disk) to NVRAM cells (the actual flash memory cells) to balance the wear. Which means telling the disk to overwrite the blocks that formerly stored a specific file may result in overwriting any other spare blocks.\n\n*SSDs have a notable percentage of reserve capacity that is used to compensate dying storage cells and reduce wearing. They are not visible to the system and might hold old data fragments.\n\nNow what options do we have from inside Ubuntu to securely wipe SSDs?\nI've heard that some newer SSDs should be able to securely wipe themselves, but how do I find out whether my SSD is capable of this and how would I trigger it?\nThere should also be an ATA secure erase command, how do I find out if that is supported and how would I trigger that?\nAre there also ways to securely wipe only a given file or only unused space?\nI guess making a backup of all partitions, securely wiping the entire disk and then restoring the backup would be possible but that sounds too complicated and would take too long to be practical. Are there other alternatives? If not, what tools can I use to back up partitions without also backing up already deleted files?\nOf course standard tools like shred or wipefs are not usable here for the reasons described above. They simply overwrite a file (by overwriting its file system clusters which are bound to LBAs which are not constantly pointing to the same flash cells due to the wear-levelling controller).\n\nA: \nWarning: In case it's not already clear, securely erasing the drive will eliminate all data on the drive and should make it impossible to recover. You should backup all critical information.\n\nThe easiest way to determine whether your drive supports secure erase is to ask it: I've used /dev/sdX in the examples below. You'll need to carefully change it to match the device you are working with:\nSources:\nhttps://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1161531/how-to-un-freeze-drive-in-linux\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep -i erase\n\nOn my SSD this results in:\nsupported: enhanced erase\n2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT.\n\nIf secure erase is supported by your device, triggering it is a 2 or 3 step process.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the device reports that it's frozen as indicated by output from sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX similar to this: \n\n\n\nnot   enabled\nnot   locked\n      frozen\nnot   expired: security count\nsupported: enhanced erase\n\n\nUnfreeze it by suspending and resuming your system. I did this with the command sudo  systemctl suspend\n moving the pointer until the system resumed.\n\n\n*You must set a password to use secure erase in this case I'm using foobar as the password, you can use whatever non-blank password you like as it's temporary.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass foobar /dev/sdX\n\n*With the password set you can now use it to securely erase the drive:\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase foobar /dev/sdX\nIf your drive supports it and you so desire you can opt to use the enhanced security erase instead with:\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase-enhanced foobar /dev/sdX\n\nA: Currently there's no way to securely erase files on SSD without erasing the content of the whole drive or access to the firmware of the SSD.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's impossible to know where the SSD may store previous copies of a logical block.\n\n*To make matters worse, due to journalling and copy-on-write mechanisms of the file system it may be impossible to know which logical blocks may  hold a previous copy of a particular file.\nThe only way to prevent the leakage of deleted files to someone with direct access to the drive is to encrypt them in the first place and keep the encryption key safe from prying eyes.\nAddendum:\nI did some research and found out that you can sort-of erase all previously deleted files if you manage to learn all the unoccupied sectors of a file system, which is generally possible and offered by some file system tools (e. g. for the ext* family), and then discard them (e. g. with blkdiscard(8) as outlined in this answer to the linked question), which returns the blocks for garbage collection until they're used again and overwritten in the process.\nThis is secure against everyone who cannot access the flash cells directly, so everyone who\n\n\n*\n\n*doesn't have a suitable flash cell reading device and\n\n*cannot talk the drive firmware into revealing the content of unassigned blocks (which would require a meaningful modification of the firmware in most cases and custom ATA commands since there's no standardised way).\n\n", "Q: Cronjob script not being executed I have installed a cron job to run at 4 AM every day however it is not being executed. \nIf I run the script manually it executes with no problem so I don't think permissions are the issue.\nI checked the log and have found the cron is being started with the following lines\nJul  4 04:00:01 Server /USR/SBIN/CRON[30888]: (log-transfer-user) CMD (/home/log-transfer-user/scripts/execute_script.sh^M)\nJul  4 04:00:01 Server /USR/SBIN/CRON[30887]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)\n\nFor some reason ^M is being appended to the path of the script.

Notice the word 'restricted.' This word is used by ubuntu because the package contains content that\nTHE ISSUE\nFirst of all, according to your comments, ffmpeg is not installed. But I guess you know that much by now.\nThe issue here is that you replaced a codec; specifically your FLV codec. The ffmpeg FLV codec does work, it just probably is not compatible with the one that you were using before.\nA codec has two main jobs: compression and decompression. To achieve these jobs, the programmer has to write an algorithm for each. The first has to give back a smaller version of the file. It is up to the programmer to decide how to do this.\nThis is important because a set of identical files that are compressed by different versions (implementations) of the \"same\" codec are different.\nThis is why your FLV files aren't working. Your new codec is trying to decompress files that it did not compress.\nWhen a codec decompresses a file that it compressed, It should get back something really close to the original. (How close depends on the type of codec. For more info, research lossful and lossless compression formats.)\nNote: When you switch out the decompression algorithm, the same thing should happen. You should get back something resembling the original. However, in the real world, standards aren't always followed.\nIn fact, in researching for this question, I learned that some codec formats are not even officially standardized. These are made up of just a basic idea and a free-for-all. I would guess that FLV is one of these. This is probably why it is not as popular as, for example, MP3.\n", "Q: Cannot compress files after upgrading to Ubuntu16.04 I just found that I cannot compress files using the default built-in compression function of Ubuntu.

I have a Logitech T650 touchpad that I'm using with Ubuntu 16.04. It uses the Synaptics TouchPad driver. Works great except for one really annoying problem: when using the \"two-finger flick\" gesture in under to scroll up and down, if you flick too quickly this will be detected as a either a one-finger or a two-finger tap instead of a flick, and it will do a left-click or a right-click instead of scrolling.\nYou often use many flick gestures quickly to scroll through a web page so it's quite likely you'll end up unintentionally left- and right-clicking things on the way.\nSome very interactive websites, e.g. Trello, have a lot of click targets in areas that are also scrollable and when clicked these targets move, modify and delete things. You have to be very careful when scrolling on these sites.\nI know that accurate detection of taps vs scrolls is possible: I used to use an Apple Magic TrackPad on Ubuntu, I don't think it uses the Synaptics driver, I never had any of these false positives while scrolling with that.\nI've been trying many Synaptics settings in synclient but can't find a configuration that reliably gets rid of false positive clicks while scrolling.\nDoes anyone know a solution?\n\nA: You can install libinput instead of using xorg-synaptics.\nIt can be done by running\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-libinput\n\nIf you need to enable tapping, you can do it in the config file.\nFor more details see this question.\n", "Q: LXD permission issues in Juju I have recently updated to juju2.0-beta11 running on Ubuntu 16.04.\nI was using the previous release with success but I am having problems since the upgrade a few days ago.

I guess because there is no manual installed with it.\nSo, is there a way to install a manual for a package installed from the source ??!!\nPS : I know that using the option --help with almost every program will bring me some kind of help, or even a manual of the command, but I really need to install a real manual, the one that can be brought with the man command.\nI hope my question is clear.\n\nA: man man says:\n   -l, --local-file\n          Activate `local' mode.  Format and display  local  manual  files\n\nYou can use man --local-file /path/to/file. For example, if you want to read a man page called example, you can use man --local-file ./example, assuming such file exists in the current directory.\n", "Q: Firefox file dialog doesn't see cryptomator volumes (vault) I have ubuntu 16.04 with firefox (47.0) and cryptomator 1.1.0 applications installed. \nOn my machine has one cryptomator volume (known as vault) mounted and it's not visible to any firefox file dialog (open file, output, etc), but it's visible opening a nautilus windows or other application (Ex: chromium) file dialog. \nIs it a bug (firefox? nautilus? cryptomator?) or access to these webdav volumes is out of scope of firefox specifications? In windows 7, same vault is visible to firefox.\nI've opened an issue in cryptomator github. \n\n\n*\n\n*Vault visible\n\n\n\n\n\n*Vault not visible on firefox dialog\n\n\n\n\nA: A workaround that seems to do the trick is to create a symbolic link to your mounted vault.\nE.g., to put a link in a directory called ~/links: First make sure your vault is mounted, which will open a nautilus window with your vault. From the nautilus window, right-click on the background and select \"Open in Terminal\". Then type the following commands:\nvaultpath=`pwd`\nmkdir ~/links\ncd ~/links\nln -s $vaultpath vault\n\nYou should now see a folder called \"vault\" located in \"~/links\", that you can open from within Firefox or anywhere else, as long as your vault is mounted.\nThis worked for me and survived a restart. I guess it is contingent on cryptomator not changing the name of the mount directory.\n", "Q: Disk changes device path during copy, from /dev/sdc to /dev/sdd I'm trying to clone the internal hard disk of my computer.

If you leave the folder, UEFI will often find the boot files & add them again to UEFI boot menu. It can depend on how you have mounted ESP on where it is. Inside install it is /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft. But newer versions of Ubuntu make ESP write protected with 0077 mount permissions in fstab. Change to defaults like 14.04 and remount to make sure no errors before rebooting and you have to reboot for new permissions on /efi to take effect:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\nsudo mount -a\n\n14.04 fstab entry defaults\nUUID=FD76-E33D  /boot/efi       vfat    defaults        0       1\n\n16.04 fstab entry umask=0077\nUUID=68CD-3368  /boot/efi       vfat    umask=0077      0       1\n\nThis discusses the removal of an entry.

Sorry if the title is ambiguous, however I'm quite new to Ubuntu but have just set up a webserver running it with a group \"developers\" that are all sudo. \nAt the moment Users can only login via SSH with a key tied to their account. But user1 could simply do: \nsudo su - user2\n\nAnd act as user2 without a password. Is there a way to force the same behaviour as \nsu - user2 \n\nwhich will actually require user2's password? Otherwise tracking each users commands to see who's done what is somewhat pointless..\nThanks!\n\nA: To prevent switching users by sudo su -, you need to disable root's ability to su to any user. Edit /etc/pam.d/su and comment this line:\nauth       sufficient pam_rootok.so \n\nAs the comment above this in /etc/pam.d/su says, this allows root to su without passwords.\nOr you could restrict sudo usage to a limited set of commands which don't include su and force user-switching via sudo -i -u/sudo -s -u, and enable the targetpw option in sudoers.\n\nA: Sudo privileges should only be given to those who may need to administer the machine itself. Other privileges can be managed through groups and group privileges. For instance, add user named 'developer1' to the www-data group:\nsudo usermod -a -G www-data developer1\n\nThis will add 'developer1' to Apache's www-data group.\nsudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www\n\nWill make sure that all files and directories in /var/www belong to group 'www-data'.\nsudo chmod -R g+w /var/www\n\nWill make sure that the group has write access to all files in /var/www\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-add-user-to-group-www-data/\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a laptop with Windows 10 I have two drives (C, D) on my laptop and Windows 10 is installed on C. \nNow, if I install Ubuntu 14.04 and choose the option \"Replace Windows with Ubuntu\", will it delete all current data from my D drive?\n\nA: Yes it will. In fact, it will delete all the windows partitions C and D. First, you should create different partitions for ubuntu and create a backup for windows so that in case of any mistake, you will not use your data. Then, you should go for something else option. For step by step method, a good tutorial:\nhttp://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-alongside.html\nIt will Dual boot windows and ubuntu. It means you can use both windows and ubuntu.\nIf you want to install only ubuntu,then go for the replace windows with ubuntu options.

You may have two physical disks or two partitions on one disk, but Windows will not show it.\nWhen Ubuntu installer tells you that all data will be wiped from your disk, it means that the whole physical disk will be wiped.\nAnyway you can install Ubuntu on your D partition if you choose manual method and tell the installer to wipe where to install Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu I've got dual boot going OK.

Ensure the letter to the right of the partition type is not \"D\", as this means it's set for deletion. It can be changed to other partition types L,E or P (Logical, Extended, or Primary). Only duplicates that don't work should be marked for deletion after you've found all your working partitions.\nOnce you've located the partitions, and are able to access the files, choose the [Write] option to save the partition tables.\nFor complete instructions and detailed recovery options, please see this step by step guide : http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\n\nA: \ndid I make a mistake?\n\nYou overwrote the beginning of drive /dev/sdc with a ISO file. From the last part of your question, it seems it is not what you wanted to do. Hence yes, it was a mistake. A pretty bad one.\nYou should have used /dev/sdc2.\n\nHow can I get the three partitions system back?\n\nAs you have determined, you can easily restore the 2nd and the 3rd ones by using TestDisk.\nTestDisk can create a partition table from the file systems it finds on your drive. The basic idea, however, is that you shoulde use TestDisk to copy the files on a different drive, then recreate your partitions from scratch.\nYou won't be able to do the same on the first one because it is damaged. You need to analyze /dev/sdc1 with an advanced recovery tool like R-Linux.\n", "Q: How to dual-boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 10? Ran into a roadblock http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-alongside_8.html\nI've been using this guide to try and install Ubuntu onto my computer. It was a Windows 7 machine with a standard BIOS and was later upgraded to Windows 10.\nI've gotten pretty far into it. I shrunk my C: partition to allocate 48GB towards the install (there's no other partitions on the HDD, and this 48GB now shows as unallocated). Made the USB stick to boot into Ubuntu, try to start up the installation process and... there's no option to install alongside Windows 10. \nWhen I select 'Something else', I see that there is ~50GB labeled as 'unusable'. I'm not sure if this is the partition I made. There's an sda1 and sda2, for Windows Recovery and the Windows loader, respectively. sda3 which appears to be the entire HDD for my personal files, and an sda4 which also shows up in Windows as a recovery partition. This is alongside the ~50GB unusable. Windows says it's all dynamic, if that helps. I tried to see if I could just make a simple volume out of that 48GB but every option I tried just says that there's not enough space available on the disk to perform that option.\nI'm not sure what else to do here. I read about disabling fast boot and hibernation but from what I've seen those appear to be UEFI-type options, and as aforementioned this is just a standard BIOS laptop. \nAny suggestions? I am unfamiliar with Ubuntu and installing any type of OS in general, so apologies if I missed an obvious step.\n\nA: Your dynamic partitions are the first problem, they need to be \"basic\" for the Ubuntu installer to see them.  Search around for ways to convert/recreate them, which has nothing to do with Ubuntu.  \nNext problem is a likely MBR partitioned disk, with a max of four primary partitions (your dynamic partitions get around this but basic wont.  You need to make one of the primaries an extended, which should have all the free space, so the Ubuntu installer can make logical partitions as needed (root and swap probably all you need).  \nThen you're ready for the Ubuntu install, which is the standard legacy install, except the installer can boot both UEFI and legacy -- only a problem if your machine can boot both, and it decides to boot UEFI.  You need to ensure the BIOS is set to boot legacy only or legacy before  UEFI in that case.\n", "Q: Initramfs after Kubuntu 16.04 installation - possibly partitioning error I installed Kubuntu on my desktop, which had Windows 8.1 installed.

Execute this command and enter password when asked:\necho 50|sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nThe brightness should become low. 50 here is the level of backlight you want. It's interpreted relative to a maximum value. You can see this fixed maximum value by executing cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness.You can make a set of programs to modify brightness and assign keys to them using xbindkeys(this is what I've done).

The install DVD is mounted as /dev/sda1, but I don't see any other /dev/sd* device besides a in /dev.\nI'm an oldschool Linux guy, and I know that /dev filesystem has changed multiple times over the years. How do I figure out the device names?\nOne extra info about my machine is that it has an SLI GPU configuration, which takes up the PCIe lines from the shipset AFAIK (that's why plain GT80 doesn't have NMVe M.2s AFAIK), so it can very well happen that MSI might have used an extra chipset in the GT80S Titan series to provide PCIe lines (?). I'm not sure if that affects the device names, the NMVe drives for sure are not on the SATAIII controllers.\nThe RAID volume is configured and assembled in the BIOS.

Check the 'Primary Display' box and do 'Identify Display' command again.  \nEdit: Set Benq as primary, then select the other (non-existent) monitor and uncheck 'Use this display' option. Then reboot, just to make sure Ubuntu understood everything correctly. This will force Ubuntu to use Benq exclusively.

Before, everything worked well, but now when I want to play a media - sound, video, etc. - using VLC, there isn't any sound. The system notifications have sound. \nI reinstalled VLC, but the problem still exists.\nI don't know  what's wrong with it.\nI have another OS, Windows 7, in that everything has sound. So the problem is not from the hardware of my system.\n\nA: have you checked the volume mixer in the system tray, while VLC is running, to make sure that the volume for it isn't turned down or off? Just left click on the speaker icon. \nIn addition, you could open a console and run: alsamixer to check volume settings there. \nFinally open your system settings and revise the settings of your reproduction devices...

I'm using a 2008 MacBook and the newest version of OS X it can run (10.7.5). The program to create the bootable USB on the Ubuntu website doesn't work.\nAny other suggestions?\n\nA: You can use the dd command from the Terminal:\ndd if=path_to_your_image.iso of=/dev/sdX\n\nReplace /dev/sdX by your USB stick's. You can find the /dev/sdX device path matching your USB with this command: diskutil list\ndd needs a few seconds or minutes to write your ISO (depending on its size), just wait until your command prompt comes back and you'll have a bootable USB.\n\nA: Download UNetbootin for Mac OS X and create the bootable USB with the Ubuntu ISO-file.\nUNetbootin is self-explainable, version-independent and works pretty fine on all systems.\n", "Q: Can't get lubuntu to boot One of my Pentium 4 HT machines is slow all the time with Windows XP, so I unplugged the drive with Windows on it and put a 160GB hard drive in there and burned Minimal Lubuntu to a CD (only version of Ubuntu I could fit onto a 700MB CD).

GMA 915 onboard produces blank screen after bios when I encountered this problem.\n\nA: Check out: My Ubuntu is running fsck on every bootup\nSeems that there is a graphics related issue.  If your PC has a built-in graphics, I think the 915 has a VGA port on it, then try to boot with that first.  \nThere's some additional flags you can enable, but try that quick test and see what you get.  If you can boot then you can start to look at the FX5200 as a possible source of the issues on boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 - Force the use of AMD graphics I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 (fresh install). I have a Hybrid AMD/intel graphic card. Ubuntu uses intel card as default.\nHow can I force ubuntu to use the AMD radeon R6 M265 with open source drivers?\nI do not care to switch between cards, I just want to use AMD. I cannot disable the intel card in bios.\nThank you!\n\nA: You might be able to force it to use AMD with open source drivers, but you're probably going to have worse performance than you will just using Intel.\nThe AMD open source drivers have no support for newer OpenGL (or CL, can't remember) versions, which cripples some video playback and kills many graphically intense applications. It also puts Minecraft out of the question.\nEven though in normal cases, integrated graphics are less powerful than discrete (even AMD), the lack of an adequate driver for AMD cards in Linux means AMD cards will probably have worse performance than Intel in most cases.\n", "Q: Reinstall software-center in Ubuntu 16.04 I wanted to remove and reinstall the software-center package. \nI removed it, but now I can't reinstall.\nI tried these commands without success:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nHow can I reinstall software-center?\n\nWhen I performed the install command this is what I got:\n$ sudo apt-get install software-center\nReading package lists...

It's named ubuntu-software. I didn't reinstall through terminal, I used Synaptic, but I think you could probably reinstall by \nsudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-software\n\nAlso, you don't need apt-get in 16.04. You just need the apt.\n\nA: I believe the Ubuntu Software Centre was replaced by the GNOME Software Centre in the new Ubuntu update.\nTo install the new GNOME software centre try the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/gnome-software\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-software packagekit\n\n\nA: Couple of things to try.\n\n\n*\n\n*check to see if the packages are still available sudo apt list | egrep software-center\nlubuntu-software-center/xenial,xenial 0.0.10-0ubuntu2 all\nsoftware-center/xenial,xenial 16.01+16.04.20160420 all\nsoftware-center-aptdaemon-plugins/xenial,xenial 0.1.6build1 all\nubuntu-kylin-software-center/xenial,xenial 1.3.10 all  \n\n\n*if not then try to get the packages sudo apt-get *software-center*\nSee if that helps.\nI ran the above commands on my 16.04 install to see which \"software-center\" packages are installed by default.

Ubuntu recognizes its own SSD as /dev/sdc and I guess therefore creates my /boot/grub/grub.cnf with update-grub2 as follows:\nset root='hd2,msdos5'\nif [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd2,msdos5 --hint-efi=hd2,msdos5 --hint-baremetal=ahci2,msdos5  66754cf8-aeb2-4eeb-a799-c4641cda0065\nelse\n  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 66754cf8-aeb2-4eeb-a799-c4641cda0065\nfi\n\nBut when I'm booting the system, I need to manually change all the hd2s into hd0 in grub for Ubuntu to boot, otherwise it cannot find the rootfs. I guess the problems are here since the upgrade from 14.04, but since I don't use this computer as much, I'm not sure exactly.\nMy /etc/defaults/grub should be unchanged as far as I remember:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nAny idea what might be wrong? (I might be slow in testing stuff, since I don't have access to this machine all the time, but all answers are appreciated!)\nEdit: It was on both SSDs, even though there is an old Windows installation on the other SSD. I of course checked if my changes in /boot/grub affected it, but both grubs seem to be using the config. Long story short, thanks to the commen from @Dorian, I changed the boot order in the bios and it works now.\n\nA: From the sounds of it, grub is installed on a disk/partition that isn't set to boot.  Or it may be installed on multiple drives.\nRun sudo fdisk -l to list all your partitions and see which one is set to boot. \nYou have 2 options.\n1) You can change your BIOS boot order, so that your computer boots into the correct GRUB that Linux is using.\n2) Or, you can install Grub to the correct drive that is set to boot first by doing sudo grub-install /dev/sdx where X is your drive that is set to boot in your BIOS.\n", "Q: Blank desktop on Lubuntu 14.04 I get a blank desktop after logging in on Lubuntu 14.04. Have tried following this wonderful guide (among others), but it doesn't work for me. I have installed Unity and enabled it, but maybe this doesn't do the trick because it's Lubuntu? \nI also tried installing Xfce environment, but I don't get anything on the desktop then either.\nI should add that I'm still not good at Linux and noticed that I have managed to remove several paths from my PATH variable when setting it (shortly before these problems appeared). Just though I'd mention if it could have anything to do with my problems.\nAlso, I can only get to the terminal by Ctrl + Alt + F1 and right clicking on desktop doesn't do anything.\n\nA: My speculations about the problem having to do with the PATH variable in fact turned out to be correct. I had added a new path in the file /etc/environment, but instead of adding it to the end of the already existing row with paths, I added it as a new line afterwards (as I wasn't sure how it should be done and just thought I'd give it a try).\nApparently this gave rise to the problem of not getting any icons or being able to do anything from my desktop (as well as a lot of other problems I'm sure, that I probably would have noticed had I actually been able to do something!).\n", "Q: revert to older version of the default video player I recent re-installed Ubuntu 16.04, and I don't like the version of the default video player. I would like to install the older version because 1) it allowed me to start the videos where I left off, instead of starting over at the beginning, and 2) it was easier to create and view playlists.\nThank you in advanced\n\nA: You can check what versions are available to you with sudo apt-cache madison ^packagename\nReplace \"packagename\" with the package you're trying to downgrade.\nThen, sudo apt-get remove packagename\nThen install the package with the version you want:\nsudo apt-get install packagename=1.2\\*\nReplace the version number with the one you want. Using the \\* is a wildcard for subversions. Or you can copy the entire version from the list that the first command gave you.\n", "Q: Why isn't Composer updated? I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS amd64.

I can not tell you technically why this is happening to you, but I have experienced this before, not with Ubuntu though.  I just went on to use \"F12\" to enter my boot options every time I booted and selected WINDOWS BOOT MGR when I wanted Windows and LINUXDISTRO when I wanted Linux.  \nI know this doesn't answer your question, but that was my similar experience and work around.\n\nA: Best way to go through (as I've done at least ten times by now) is to first boot windows in safe mode, disable optane memory (if in use) and keeping windows in safe, boot to bios mode and change SATA connection from RAID to AHCI, and then boot in the bootable usb to install Ubuntu.\nIn my case, I was installing Ubuntu 20.04 and the usb installer doesn't let me install with raid configurations so I have to turn off raid before installing.\nIf the installer is letting you go upto the point of choosing something else,  then you must be free to go without any trouble.\nMeanwhile installing grub on the drive the ubuntu is on won't give any troubles, even if windows is on same partition.

This is native resolution of the laptop monitor.\nThere was no flickering before when running win7 on same resolution and there is no flickering on 1280x800 resolution I'm using now to avoid epilepsy seasure :) This fact rules out that something is wrong with the graphics card.\nI did a bit of research and these are the other things I've learned/tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no way to install fglrx drivers on ubuntu 16.04.\n\n*I've added GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.dpm=1\" as suggested on official site which has maybe helped with heating but it obviously hasn't helped with flickering\n\n*There was a suggestion to add new mode to xrandr which I tried, added successfully but flickering remained when switched to that mode xrandr --newmode \"1680x1050_60.00\" 146.25 1680 1784 1960 2240 1050 1053 1059 1089 -hsync +vsync\nJust for the record, when listing xrandr modes only the problematic resolution has a number > 60 (60.11) next to it (which is I presume refresh rate), all other modes have < 60 (59.70-59.98) so this is now my main suspect.\n\nThank for your time and effort,\nKanwal\n\nA: I know this is an old post, but it's also the top result on Google for several relevant queries, and there's nothing more frustrating than only finding unanswered questions from other users having the same problem. So in hopes of helping someone who passes by - even if you've given up by now, OP - here's what fixed the horrid screen tearing I experienced on my client's laptop with an X1600 on Linux Mint 18 MATE (solution should apply to any Ubuntu 16.04-based distro including 16.04 itself):\nThis thread on the Peppermint Linux forums suggests creating a 20-radeon.conf file with the specified parameters. I did so, but left out the DRI line. So, my /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-radeon.conf file reads:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Radeon\"\n    Driver \"radeon\"\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"glamor\"\n    Option \"TearFree\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nI also removed the 10-amdgpu.conf file that was already in xorg.conf.d. I'm not certain this helped anything, but it didn't hurt, as the amdgpu driver does not and will never support this card. However, inxi -F previously showed both the ati and radeon drivers running for this card, and post-fix only radeon is loaded.\nMagic!

Short Version\nHow do you reset the default window positioning and sizing rules? As in, when an application starts, it remembers its last position and size. I want it to not do that, and start in whatever position it would have started in a fresh install.\nIs there a list somewhere that I can just delete (or modify)?\nSystem info\nUbuntu MATE 16.04 LTS, using Compiz\nLong Version and Explanation\nMy reason for asking is probably a little weird. I have an application (specifically, Kerbal Space Program) that has started crashing immediately on load. I had been tweaking the keyboard shortcuts within the game, and accidentally set one to one of Compiz's window resize shortcuts that I never use (mea culpa) and when I used it the game immediately crashed. Ever since then, it won't load at all.\nAnswers to questions before you ask them:\n\"This sounds like a bug in KSP and is therefore not relevant here\"\nYou're probably right, but I can't rewrite the game's code. I have multiple versions of the game installed, and they're all giving me exactly the same problem. So wherever the problem is, it's not anywhere in the game's local files, because those are all separate. I think it's a case of KSP not responding intelligently to a situation it didn't expect.\nBasically, I have a suspicion that if I can reset the default window size, the problem will go away, which is why I'm asking this here.\n\"Is KSP giving any helpful error messages?\" No.\n\"Is KSP giving any unhelpful error messages?\" No.\n\"Surely you've tried this in other window managers?\" Indeed. Same problem in Compiz and Marco. I haven't tried installing any others.\n\"Does it work in other user accounts?\" Like a dream. I have all my KSP installs on a separate drive, so they're accessible for my test user -- and it loads just fine.\n\nA: I found this answer while doing some research into your problem and I thought that it might be of use as while it wont reset the default permissions it will allow you to choose the size of the window when the program is opened.\n\nA: General solution:\nUsing the dconf editor (the GUI one, via the dconf-editor package on ubuntu and similar, is most convenient, though the command line one via dconf-cli probably will work too) search for the relevant settings.  For GTK standard dialogs such as the file chooser, color chooser, etc, they are likely located in org/gtk/settings, and for standalone applications, they are likely located in org/gnome.\nDifferent applications store their settings in different ways so your mileage may vary, but try looking around in there for the application (or vendor thereof) you are using, and see if you can find a key relating to window size.\nI fixed my problem by setting org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/window-size to (800, 600), and the next time I used the open-file dialog, it had the requested size.\nHere's what I was doing:\n\n I use X11 forwarding on a remote server for home development and somehow the open file dialog was resized to a very large size, such that it exceeded the size of the monitors upon which I do my work, and I was thus unable to navigate the GUI easily, having to use it by keyboard shortcuts only.  This was annoying, but not annoying enough to do something drastic to fix, so it persisted for years (as you cannot resize this dialog via ordinary means when using X11 forwarding on xming). Every so often it would frustrate me and I would search the internet for a solution about how to fix it, finding this and other questions like it on stackoverflow, but with no applicable answers.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot into Ubuntu with extra hard drive I have a SSD 60GB with Ubuntu. And it was working all right.\nThen I decided to add one more hard drive. It was previously in a different PC under win Xperia. Then I cleaned it and formatted it, so it's empty. But if I add it to this PC, I can't boot into Ubuntu. The process stops after recognizing ram and proc.\nWith this configuration I even can't get into BIOS. If I unplug the second disk Ubuntu works again. Can you help?\n\nA: You should check your bios settings to check the correct boot sequence. You have to be sure that the first storage is your SSD where you have installed Ubuntu. \n\nA: This is normal. You can boot from only one hard drive. \nThis is what I understood into your question: You have a desktop PC in which you have placed a SSD, this is not a USB drive but it is connected straight on the motherboard via the approprate cable. Then you connect another HDD even on the motherboard into another free connection and after this the PC don't boot in the way you are expecting. If I'm right still here, what you have to do is switch on the PC pushing the \"del\" or \"backwords\" button to open the bios settings then, looking for the boot sequence then, select as a primary boot device your SSD then, check there are no other devices specified for booting the system (CD-ROM is good to left as a second chance) then, be sure to save the settings changes then, boot the PC\n", "Q: Clicking ISO does nothing in the 'Make Startup Disk'.

Please write to me simply, thank you!\n\nA: The \"Startup Disk creator\" application which comes with Ubuntu only supports Ubuntu / Linux ISOs, so it will not be able to write a Windows 7 ISO to a USB stick.\nIn order to create a bootable USB stick for a Windows, on an Ubuntu machine, see How can I create a Windows bootable USB stick using Ubuntu?, or you could burn the Windows 7 ISO to a DVD.\n", "Q: Snapcraft: autoreconf: 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' is required I followed the snapcraft.io/create tutorial to create the following snapcraft.yaml:\nname: vokoscreen-snap\nversion: \"2.5.0\"\nsummary: Vokoscreen Screencast\ndescription: Screencast software\n  This is part of the snapcraft tour at https://snapcraft.io/create/\nconfinement: strict\n\napps:\n  vokoscreen:\n    command: vokoscreen-snap\n\nparts:\n  vokoscreen:\n    plugin: autotools\n    source: http://linuxecke.volkoh.de/vokoscreen/vokoscreen-2.5.0.tar.gz\n\nRunning snapcraft, however, results in the following error:\norschiro@x230:~/Downloads/vokoscreen-snap$ snapcraft \nSkipping pull vokoscreen (already ran)\nPreparing to build vokoscreen \nBuilding vokoscreen \nautoreconf -i\nautoreconf: 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' is required\nCommand '['/bin/sh', '/tmp/tmpsmpubw0c', 'autoreconf', '-i']' returned\nnon-zero exit status 1\n\nI made sure that build-essential is installed properly. How can I resolve the build error?\n\nA: The autotools plugin, which is specified in your snapcraft.yaml is needed for the ./configure && make && sudo make install kind of software. (You can check the output of snapcraft help autotools to get an idea what it does, what its features are and what it expects.)\nLooking at the contents of vokoscreen-2.5.0.tar.gz, it likely won't need the autotools plugin to build:\ndaniel@daydream:/tmp$ tar xfvz vokoscreen-2.5.0.tar.gz \n./vokoscreen.run\ndaniel@daydream:/tmp$ file vokoscreen.run \nvokoscreen.run: POSIX shell script executable (binary data)\ndaniel@daydream:/tmp$ \n\nThe tarball contains only one executable, which looks like it's self-extracting. As far as I know there's no plugin for snapcraft which takes care of that yet, so you might want to write your own plugin. It should be just a couple of lines of python.\nUpdate: Looking at https://codeload.github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreen/tar.gz/2.5.0 you could also just build it from source using the qmake plugin.\n", "Q: Grub takes 45 Secs to show boot menu since some time I have a problem with grub.\nAfter the post screen at computer startup I get a black screen for about 45 seconds till the boot menu shows up.\nAfter selecting the system to boot everything is blazingly fast as it should. Only the boot menu itself takes a eternity to show up.\nI removed all hard disks except the system disk, installed Ubuntu 16.04 (as a test) and now even changed the mainboard and CPU (due to another problem)\nNothing has helped. Grub used to come up in seconds before.\nIs there anything I can do to isolate that problem?\nMy system is Kubuntu 14.04 on a i3-6100 CPU, 16 GB RAM and 250GB ssd\n\nA: The problem is in your BIOS settings. Your \"Boot Order\", which specifies the order in which the BIOS tries to boot from. The 1st device in your list doesn't respond, (and maybe devices 2 through N-1). This takes about 45 seconds. Then the BIOS tries device N (the right one) and boots. grub ensues.\nThere's a key F2 or F12 YMMV that you can hit during early boot (before the black screen) to access your Boot Order. Adjust it.\n\nA: Finally I found the answer.\nupdate grub has thrown several thousands of nonsense entries in the grub.cfg (the file was ~16.000 lines big!)\nAfter deleting the memtest86+ file and an old linux image from /boot and running upate-grub again everything was fine.\nThough I don't understand what was going on there the error is now gone.\n", "Q: clonezilla \"the volume group setting is not found\" My clone image creations (image file) kept failing with the msg \"unable to write to device\" and further up on the screen (as Clonezilla displays logs of what is happening) I noticed \"The volume group setting is not found\". Great what does that mean?\n\nA: Explanation:\nThe \"The volume group setting is not found\" error is thrown because there is a \"lvm\" flag (or in GParted it will display as \"lvm2 pv\") set for a partition AND there is no actual Volume Group setup in that partitions file system.\nWhich then results in the misleading error msg from Clonezilla \"unable to write to device\".\nSolution: \nOnce you create the VG/LV on that partition OR remove the \"lvm\" partition flag, you no longer will receive these error message and will be able to write to your drive.\n", "Q: how to install Eclipse neon via the software manager I cant find Eclipse neon in the software manager. There are some very lengthy tutorials on how to do it via the terminal using some yedi tricks. I cant do that, I use Eclipse for work and not as a play station substitution, I need to install it and run it and get my work done. I come from windows, there I just hit the setup.exe and Im done. So I need a similar way in Linux which must exist because I read that all applications can be installed via the software manager which led me to now switch to Linux. Thanks for any hints.\nPS: Thanks for the warm welcome by giving a down vote 15 minutes after posting. Really encouraging the Linux newbies ...\n\nA: Go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ .  Find the \"Get Eclipse Neon\" block, there should be a \"Download 64 bit\" button there, then the \"Download\" button.  That will give you a \"eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz\".  Open it with your archive manager.  Extract it to a temporary location (subdir of Downloads, most likely).  Then open the resulting \"eclipse-installer\" directory and execute the \"eclipse-inst\" executable.  Follow the instructions.\nIn short, the packaged software installer for Linux will be a little behind the latest available versions for packages, and may not always be the best way to install particular things.\n", "Q: Adobe Flash on Linux I cannot watch a video stream because the site says I need Adobe Flash 11.8.0. My version is 11.2.202. (This is a recently acquired used computer formerly with Windows and now with Linux. I am not a tech person - I'm an end user. So be kind, please!!)\nI went to the Adobe site and it stated I had the latest version for Linux. I went to the Adobe site directed by the video provider (Comcast) and I saw a statement that Adobe is not providing upgrades for Linux beyond 11.2 any longer.\nI tried downloading a version from the Adobe site and the readme.txt told me to unpack the tar.gz file. On your Q&A site, it says not to use a tar.gz file.\nCan anyone direct me in end-user language (who knows nothing about Linux) what I need to do?\nThank you!\n\nA: The easiest way in this case is to use Google Chrome. It has the latest Adobe Flash built-in.\n", "Q: Set up of 'sendmail' headers for cron jobs (crontab-user@mydomain.xyz) I use Ubuntu 14 on AWS EC2. \nI have a non-root user crontab. Upon cron job completion, an email is to MAILTO address, as set in crontab. The email sender looks like this: \nroot@ip-111-11-0-11.us-east-1.compute.internal\nHow can I change the \"from\" email to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*crontab-username@my-domain.com or \n\n*do-not-reply@my-domain.com ?\n\n\nEDIT-1:\nFollowing contributed comments, I executed telnet localhost 25 in terminal and got back:\n220 ip-111-11-0-11.us-east-1.compute.internal ESMTP Sendmail 8.14.4/8.14.4/Debian-4.1ubuntu1\nTue, 5 Jul 2016 13:38:31 GMT\n(No UCE/UBE) logging access from: localhost(OK)-localhost [127.0.0.1]\n\nSo my MTA is sendmail, and my question becomes:\nHow do I configure sendmail so my cron jobs' email headers are as above ?\n\nA: man 5 crontab will solve your problem. It says, in part:\nAn  active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a\n   cron command.  An environment setting is of the form,\n\n       name = value\n\n   where the spaces around  the  equal-sign  (=)  are  optional,  and  any\n   subsequent  non-leading  spaces  in  value  will  be  part of the value\n   assigned to name.  The value string may be placed in quotes (single  or\n   double, but matching) to preserve leading or trailing blanks.\n\n   Several   environment   variables  are  set  up  automatically  by  the\n   bcron-exec(8) program.  SHELL is set to /bin/sh, and LOGNAME, USER, and\n   HOME are set from the /etc/passwd line of the crontab's owner.\n\n   In  addition to LOGNAME, USER, HOME, and SHELL, bcron-exec(8) will look\n   at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail  as  a  result  of  running\n   commands  in  ``this''  crontab.  If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty),\n   mail is sent to the user so named.  If  MAILTO  is  defined  but  empty\n   (MAILTO=\"\"), no mail will be sent.  Otherwise mail is sent to the owner\n   of the crontab.  This option is  useful  if  you  decide  on  /bin/mail\n   instead  of  /usr/lib/sendmail  as your mailer when you install cron --\n   /bin/mail doesn't do aliasing, and UUCP usually doesn't read its mail.\n\n", "Q: How can I install a library from github?

So, the first step to install a project in one of the repositories is to clone it, which will create a local copy of all repository's contents on your computer. Example:\ngit clone https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core\n\nGitHub repositories generally store the source code of their project. That means that it might need to be built/compiled before proper installation. There is no one single common standard for projects being enforced on GitHub, so answer to the question in title \"How can I install a library from github?\" can vary a lot from project to project. The repository owners are free to use their preferred build and installation flows.\nThat said, it can be expected the projects to have documentation with instructions of how to build and install the project to make life easier for its users and other developers, in a README.md file at top directory or in some other obvious place.\nMoving on to the specific repository in the question details dmlc-core, there doesn't appear to be any explicit building instructions in the README.md, but the top directory does have a Makefile. Makefiles contain directives for Make utility on how to build the project, which itself is usually used for building C/C++ projects(which this one appears to be). In general executing make from the directory where the Makefile is located.\nDuring the build process, you might see compiler warnings and errors. Errors usually lead to build failure. Resolving them likely would require familiarizing yourself with the code and fixing them. Warnings are often indicators of bad practices being employed in code that could lead to bugs. Good developers will usually document reasons why they do things like that when they have to. If you can't find the reason, you can either trust the code and take responsibility for your choice or abandon ship.\nFrom the contents of the Makefile I gather that its main build target is libdmlc.a. Technically, it doesn't matter where you put it, so you can consider installation to be complete when build is successful, thought the recommended location where to put it on Ubuntu appears to be under /usr/local/.\nNow that you have the file available, you can consider it installed and ready for usage.\n\nA: Example, Ubuntu 16.04 - 64 : \nWhen you run make, it's successful when the library libdmlc.a gets created in the top directory. \nCmake : mkdir build and cd build/ && cmake ../ && make → The library libdmlccore.a is created, in the build folder. Same size (1.3MB) as libdmlc.a, so probably no difference.\n", "Q: USB Wifi Adapter Not Autoloading I have been unplugging and replugging my USB wifi adapter after every boot to get it to recognize.\nI can also do this:\nsudo modprobe -r 8812au\nsudo modprobe 8812au\n\nBut only once I have already unplugged and replugged at least once.\nIt would be really nice if I could just have it load up automatically as it should on boot.  Can anyone steer me in the right direction?  \n\nA: Please open a terminal and do:\nsudo -i\necho 8812au  >>  /etc/modules\nexit\n\nReboot and tell us if the performance is improved.\n", "Q: Weird icon on my icon tray Does anyone know what this is? It started to show up after I installed Dropbox I think, and nothing is showing up when I tried to click it. It doesn't change the behavior of my desktop though and the Dropbox folder works fine too. I just want to know what this weird icon is. Thank you!\n\n\nA: That is dropbox doing it's recent failing thing. Run this:  \ndropbox stop && dbus-launch dropbox start \nI had the same problem. It's more of a workaround, but it works. It helps to create a custom command to just run that real quick. Create an alias in /home/<user>/.bashrc:  \nalias db='dropbox stop && dbus dropbox-start`  \nOr, I wrote a script with that in it, then did  \nsudo install db.sh /path/to/db.sh/commandname \nwhere commandname runs db.sh from the terminal.\n", "Q: How to login into a network switch using ethernet cable I have a network switch which is connected to my Ubuntu Desktop through Ethernet port.\nI would like to login into the network switch and execute some commands. Can I use Minicom or is there any other way?\nI found Ethernet to serial converters online. But is it not possible to setup serial communication using a plain ethernet cable?\n\nA: Looking at some of the specifications of the Summit X440 series switches I can see both console and net management ports:\nSummit X440-8t \n\n\n*\n\n*8 x 10/100/1000BASE-T (RJ45) ports\n\n*4 x 100/1000BASE-X (SFP) unpopulated ports \n\n*2 x SummitStack \n\n*1 x Serial (console port)\n\n*1 x 10/100BASE-T out-of-band management port\n\n\nThe last port listed is the net management port, but even in the manual I cannot see a default IP address listed.  So, from my experience, to configure this switch to allow connection to the net management port for straight Ethernet you would need to connect a console connection (Serial to Ethernet) cable.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Recover files from gedit I suspended my laptop while writing some files in gedit. When I opened my laptop, it suddenly went off and lost the files I had open in the text editor. How can I recover those files?\n\nI have tried using the terminal, and I have tried Nautilus, but I can't even access Nautilus on my Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: By default, the text editor (Gedit) does not autosave documents unless you manually saved them at least once beforehand. So if you didn't save your file, it's lost, unfortunately.\nIf you did save your file, the newer autosaved copy is in the same place as where you saved the file, but with \"~\" appended. This is a hidden file, so enable \"Show hidden files\" in the file manager (Ctrl + H), or use ls -a in the terminal to see it.\n\nA: There is an issue opened for the feature of saving drafts, but it has not yet been resolved.\nYou could try to use this plugin.\n", "Q: how to fix error creating a bootable USB stick of ubuntu-16.04 iso image?

You will then be able to get to the command line. I believe one holds down Shift to get into the grub menu, although it may differ depending on your system.\nSome thoughts - \nYou may have to insert nomodeset into the /etc/defaults/grub file, as the system may be having a problem with the graphics driver or screen. \nIt might look something like this\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset quiet splash\"\n\nIt may also help to define the screen resolution in the grub file as well, for instance my file states\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080\n\nRemember to update the grub file using\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Is there any GUI tool for setting up an OpenVPN server?

WebUDP8 is an example; they build the PPA's for Atom IDE (using Electron) & Popcorn Time (using Node-Webkit)\nI did what any human being would do: bother these guys, since there's no documentation (or at least, none that I found).\nTheir answer: \n\nLaunchpad PPAs don't support nodejs yet because they don't allow fetching external resources. So the Popcorn TIme PPA used to be a simple installer that automatically downloaded Popcorn Time from its servers.\n\nBut, as far as I'm aware of, I'm not using external resources. It's not like I am downloading dependences from the package.json. They are all --saved in the folder to build.\nHow can I make a PPA of my Electron App?\nDoes the Software Center work with PPA's as well, or only .deb's?\n\nA: I think you are right. If Atom has its own PPA, any Electron app could.\nThis should help:\nHow do I create a PPA?\n\nA: WebUPD8's Atom PPA simply ships pre-built binaries. It works like this:\n\n*\n\n*WebUPD8 builds Atom on their infrastructure as usual (with access to the internet).\n\n*Once they have x86 and amd64 binaries with all required files they package them into atom-linux32.tar or atom-linux64.tar, add icons, desktop file etc. and package this as orig tarball (upstream provided source in terms of Launchpad).\n\n*Then they add debian/ packaging portion of source which is supposed to build the package - but in fact it doesn't build anything, it just checks on which architecture it runs and based on that unpacks appropriate atom-linux(32|64).tar archive so that it \"looks\" for DPKG build system binaries were built\n\n*From there all is same, files in install target in debian/rules will be packaged as binary package for that architecture.\n\nThis is not nice nor safe for users as such binary can contain malicious code added by WEBUPD8 or someone who had access to their infrastructure where they built the binaries. I also believe packaging binaries as source packages is circumvention and abuse of Launchpad PPA policy citing:\n\nNote: We do not allow uploading pre-built binary packages.\n\nas also mentioned in this answer.\nYou can check how they did it by downloading original source archive as well as their debian patch from this page: https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/atom/+packages (package details).\nProper way would be to pre-fetch all required files (entire node_modules/, all electron source files, etc.) into source package and build your application from debian/rules on Launchpad build servers. Even if you have all files in node_modules/ Electron during build downloads certain bits from the Internet and that is not going to work in Launchpad.\nThere's option for Electron that allows to cache build artifact sources on your machine (so you can theoretically include them in your source package) and then reuse during Launchpad build. All this is very complicated, error prone and requires to have environment identical to build environment etc. and probably not worth the effort. Alternative solution could be distributing your app as a snap image.\n", "Q: Change GTK+3 icon theme for a specific application Firefox doesn't play well with dark system themes and I want to use  it and only it with a light system theme, which can be done with an environment variable, but then it will still use my default icons for the menus, which are also light and turn almost invisible.\nHow to open a single GTK+3 program with a different icon theme?

Let me start by explaining that I am not technologically adept, so I would be very grateful if you could answer my question with that in mind. \nI have a Kindle ebook library of close to 6,000 books in the Amazon cloud. I was using an app called Book Collections Plus as the catalog on a Fire HD. The HD died, and with it, my entire catalog disappeared. I have learned that putting the app on my new Fire is useless because Amazon keeps changing the file extensions on the file names and even changes where the files are stored on the device, so that the app cannot find the files. \nThese are my questions:\nCould Tracker be downloaded and work efficiently on a Fire tablet with an expanded memory?\nIf Tracker won't work on a Fire, then I have a PC laptop with Windows 10. I would, though, prefer to have the catalog on the Fire. \nWould I be able to catalog books according to my own system?  And list individual books in multiple categories?  Is there a limit to the number of categories, sub-categories and sub-sub-categories I could create?\nDo I understand the following correctly?  I would have to download the entire library onto the device (Fire or Laptop). If I have to download Tracker onto my laptop, I could limit its activity to a particular directory, or even particular types of files (specifically Amazon file extensions). I would need to edit the metadata on every single book individually. No matter how Amazon changes file extensions or where Amazon stores the files (on the Fire), I would always be able to find it and catalog it. \nThank you very much for your time and attention. \nWith regard,\nKatherine Sotol\n\nA: There are multiple different models of the Kindle Fire HD, so without knowing the specific model of your Kindle Fire HD I can't provide information on how to install Ubuntu on it if that is what you are trying to do, however for starters visit the Ubuntu Touch Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" wiki. Visit all of the links on the wiki and review all of the instructions before doing anything, as the Ubuntu Touch installation requires wiping your system and factory reset. Before wiping your system, you should also make a complete backup of your Kindle Fire for recovery purposes.\nI don't know if you are comfortable with wiping your system and I wouldn't do it if it was my device, so I will also suggest an easier way of cataloging your ebook library. If you don't mind copying your ebook library to your laptop, Calibre ebook reader from the Ubuntu Software Center can manage all your cataloging tasks automatically by using the existing metadata of the ebooks in your Calibre library. Changes in the way an ebook is catalogued can be easily done by editing the ebook's metadata in Calibre.  Calibre can also be installed in Windows.\nCalibre is meant to be a complete ebook library solution. It includes library management, format conversion, news feeds to ebook conversion as well as ebook reader sync features.\nCalibre is primarily an ebook cataloging program. It manages your ebook\ncollection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book,\ni.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats.\nCalibre has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for different ebook reader devices easy. Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library and the creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in the library view. \n", "Q: What does /dev/sda3: clean mean on boot? After upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04, on boot it shows\n/dev/sda3: clean, 291272/4292608 files, 480345/18174432 blocks\n\nwhich makes Ubuntu take some time to load\n\nA: This is the output of a filesystem check at boot for the /dev/sda3 partition. fsck (actually probably e2fsck if it's an ext4 filesystem, which is the default for modern Ubuntu installations) is the program which carries out the checks. This is set to happen after a configurable number of reboots, or after a certain time period. It can also be triggered if you had to switch your computer off without properly shutting down, such as if you had to shut down by holding the power button in.\nThe piece of information that is most relevant is the word 'clean', which indicates that everything's in working order. So there's nothing to worry about.\nThe files and blocks part of the output show how many of the available files and blocks are in use. The files part actually applies to inodes, which are the underlying filesystem location for a file. So you're using 291272 out of the 4292608 available files spaces, and 480345 of the available 18174432 blocks on that partition.\nThe filesystem check will slow down your boot time, but shouldn't happen on every boot. There's also normally an option to press C to quit the check.\n\nA: The boot times of the newer distros only seem to be increasing.\nGraph of boot time increase.\nThe information it shows is usually something you'd see in ubuntu server. Its just displaying what its currently doing while your system is loading.

I am trying to send a mail via simple mail command on the command line using this piece of code:\n$ echo \"foo\" | mail -s \"Hello World\" -t \"someone@example.com\"\n\nThat’s working fine.\nMy question is the following: How can I get the MESSAGE-ID that was used for sending this mail? Is there a way to grab that information? I need this for debugging reasons.\n\nA: The mail header MESSAGE-ID is a unique identifier. It's assigned by the mail server that sends the mail out in a specific format. Typically it's some date and time information, along with the server hostname. \nYour best bet would probably be to look into how the mail server software in question builds their MESSAGE-IDs and infer the ID of your test message from that information.\nAs far as the command pipeline that sends the mail out is concerned (echo ... | mail ...): At that point there's no way to get the MESSAGE-ID, because it doesn't exist yet. It will only be generated later by the mail server software that mail hands the mail over to.\n", "Q: How can I add my username to the top panel in Xenial Xerus?

I did not delete anything, just asking, what would be.\n\nA: A complete answer depends on the firmware in your MB.\nTwo suggestions are;\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at your firmware options and see if there is an option to boot into an EFI shell.  If so boot into the shell and modify the contents of the NVRAM using the bcfg shell command.  The first option is to look at the contents of the NVRAM using bcfg boot dump which will display all NVRAM boot options.  You can the use other bcfg commands to add entries.  The bcfg commands can be found in the UEFI Shell Commands Manual. From memory it will be something like bcfg boot add ?????  where ???? is the path to a bootloader.  Be aware that this path must be able to be read by the EFI firmware and a valid bootloader must be present in this location. It is usually in the EFI Partition which is normally a GPT Fat formatted partition.  Once you create a valid NVRAM entry you cab boot into that OS and use the OS tools (like efibootmgr) to further modify the NVRAM values.\n\n*If there is no firmware option to boot into an EFI Shell then try to restore the efi firmware defaults (probably called the BIOS Defaults) in your systems MB firmware.  This should restore NVRAM entries for things like Optical Drive, HDD's, and USB devices.  You may have to ensure that there are valid UEFI bootloaders on the optical and USB drives.  \nIf all else fails I recommend reading about UEFI booting on Rod Smith's excellent pages on the subject.

You need first to open gparted (sudo apt-get install gparted) , go to your hard disk with windows and ubuntu , and delete boot flag from ubuntu partition and set it to windows. Now it will boot directly in windows. Now in Windows , you need to delete the ext4 partition (with ubuntu).

Still a little ways out, but soon you'll be able to do something like the following:\n$ snap set nextcloud listen=127.0.0.1 http-port=12345\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that HTTPS is very high on the desired feature list for the Nextcloud snap, and it'll be added soon. Is that all you're wanting, or would you still want to place it behind a proxy?\n", "Q: How to display window titles on not maximized windows? I recently moved from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS with all the resulting software upgrades. There have been a number of UI changes, but this one is most annoying.\nWindows that are not maximized do not show the window name/title anywhere.\nThe menu bar does not evens display the application name; it's just \"Text Editor\" for gedit or \"Files\" for nautilus.\nThe title bar just sits empty.\nThis is very inconvenient for many reasons; for instance, if you have multiple (untabbed) instances of gedit open it's hard to tell which file is open where.\nTitles are shown for the currently selected window in the application switcher, but that's little consolation.\nHow can I get window titles back to title bars?\nI run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Unity 7.4.0.\n\nA: I've a suggestion see my comment in this thread: https://askubuntu.com/a/798471/568202 \n\nThis is some kind of temporary fix I've found. Go to \"System settings -> Appearance -> Behavior\" and there in \"Menus visibility\" section check the option \"Displayed on mouse hovering\". The menus then will load only on mouse hover, and the titles will be shown.\n\nI think it's related with the show/hide behavior of the menus and the titles (when you focus on menu the title disappears). Basically the temporary fix is to activate the show on mouse hover option for menus. I hope it helps a bit to ease the situation until the strange behavior is dealed with by ubuntu/unity developers.\n", "Q: Open already running program via terminal How do I switch to already running program using terminal?\nFor examaple:\nfirefox opens new firefox window.\nIs there a command that will focus the already opened firefox window?\n\nA: As a one- liner\nAssuming you have wmctrl installed (run sudo apt-get install wmctrl if not):\nThe command:\nwmctrl -ia \"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep gedit)\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nWould raise the last opened gedit window.

Assuming I have a partition encrypted with LUKS, which I mount and read from and write to.\nMy question is when is the data encrypted? When I write it or when I unmount the partition?\nAlso, what happens if my system shuts down before I can unmount the partition?\n\nA: Encryption happens as you write, not on unmount. It would be hard to do that on unmount, as it would mean caching all write operations somewhere in memory before you commit them to disk (and there would be no point in caching them unencrypted on the disk...).\nNot counting the fact that it would make it unreliable.\nIf you force a shutdown without a clean unmount, you'll have the same issue(s) you'd have with regular disk, with possible corruption and missing data... It's a bad idea in general, even when you don't have encrypted your disk :-/\nFrom my small experience, using LUKS-encrypted partitions every day, there's no issue even in case of improper shutdown. The system has always been able to recover when it happened to me. I guess it depends how much you write to your disk, and how lucky you are :-)\nEDIT: for reference, LUKS encryptions is based on dm-crypt. I found some data over here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/DMCrypt\nWhich mention:\n\nWrites to this device will be encrypted and reads decrypted. You can mount your filesystem on it as usual or stack dm-crypt device with another device like RAID or LVM volume.\n\nMy understanding is that this is lower-level compatibility, meant to have the disk shown and used as any other, doing encrypt/decrypt on the fly.\nThis also answers your question about i-nodes - everything is encrypted in a LUKS partition, not just i-nodes. Encryption happens at the block level, and you can put any filesystem on top of it. So the LUKS system just doesn't know and doesn't care about i-nodes.\n", "Q: USB port mouse is detected but doesn't control screen pointer The mouse wheel works - switches between screen 1 and 2.

I want to keep source on my server.\n\nFor both of these things, you'll need to create a repository to host your package, so that it can be downloaded. The easiest way to do this is to create a PPA on Launchpad. You will then have a PPA / repository, trough which you can distribute your software. See How do I create a PPA? \n\nIs it a correct if I will run this command in postinstall script?\n\nNo, don't do this. If you create a repository, users should add it (on the computer where they want to install your package) first, using the command sudo add-apt-repository ppa:your-repo/ppa, and then install your package with sudo apt-get install yourpackage.\nIf you do not want to use a PPA, but want to submit your package to the main Ubuntu repository, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages.\n\nWhat is a signature and how I can sign my software.\n\nA \"Signature\" is a way for users to ensure that the package they get was not tampered with or modified, so that they can be sure that the package was created by you and not by someone else. This is for security. If you use Launchpad PPAs, this will be done for you. If you only want to sign the debian package, see how do you create a \"signed\" deb package\n\nWhat should be a structure of files?\n\nThere is a good guide here, otherwise, you need to make sure that the files for your program are in the right place (\"/opt/, /bin/, /lib/, and so on.)\n", "Q: Can I restore Windows while dual booting Ubuntu?

If I unplug the ethernet, \"Link detected: No\".\nI hope I have given enough information. Please let me know if I should add anything else.\nThanks.\nEDIT: \nI restarted the PC after making the changes to a static address and it now shows the correct IP and info when I do ifconfig. However, ping still doesn't work.\n\nA: If you have a DHCP Server in you network, try (as root):\n$dhclient \nIn a Terminal/Shell. This should work.\nIf you need a specific configuration, you can do this like the others described in /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf (for the nameservers).\nI think it would be a good idea, if you post your /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf, but maybe try dhclient first.\n\nA: See if your interface got an ip from dhcp first. \nifconfig -a\n\n(if it doesn't have an ip try assigning one manually) Then if you got an ip then try\nping <gateway>\n\n(if this doesn't work your network config is wrong) If that works then try pinging a public ip like 8.8.8.8. (if this works then your name resolution is not working (dns). \ncat /etc/resolv.conf \n\nand see if you have valid name servers there.\n\nA: Your interfaces file need only contain:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface io inet loopback\n# The primary network interface\nauto enp0s31f6\niface enp0s31f6 inet static\naddress xxx\nnetmask xxx\ngateway xxx\ndns-nameservers xxx\n\nPlease note that you said 'adress' and it should be address. Be sure to select an address outside the range used in the router, switch or access point for DHCP.\nGet the system to re-read and use the file:\nsudo ifdown enp0s31f6 && sudo ifup enp0s31f6\n\nCheck:\nifconfig\n\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n", "Q: kde slow boot on kubuntu 16.04 My computer boots really slow.

A 5400 RPM disk is the slowest out there.  Even 7200 or 10k RPM drives will result in a boot time of 40-60 seconds with Ubuntu 16.04.\nI have a PC with triple RAID 0 array with 10k RPM drives, and my Kubuntu 16.04 takes about 15 seconds to boot.  But my RAID array is very fast.\nOn my laptop, I had Kubuntu 15.04, and it took about 20 seconds to boot (with autologin).  I upgraded to 16.04 and my boot time went up to 55 seconds, and I tried for along time to try to improve the boot speed.  I ended up disabling and removing so much that I started having problems with the OS and made it unstable, and I was never able to get it any faster.\nMy issue: 16.04: Slow boot no matter what I remove or do (Files for analysis provided)\nMy weeks of trying in the link above didn't help with my 1TB 5400RPM drive.\nIf you absolutely do not want to downgrade to Kubuntu 14.04, or even 15.04, then your only option is to upgrade your hard drive.  I'm telling you this from experience.  You can either upgrade to a 7200RPM, or 10K RPM drive, or switch to an SSD drive.  A faster RPM mechanical drive will be a cheaper option.\nSmaller SSD's are quite affordable, and even 500GB ones aren't that expensive (about $120-150).  If you don't mind using an external USB drive for your long-term storage, you could get away with a 120GB SSD easily, and those are under $100.\nIf your laptop can take a second hard drive, you can use your SSD for the OS, and the 1TB for storage.  That was my setup before, I have an HP DV7 laptop which can take 2 drives.\nMy solution in the link I provided was to downgrade to 14.04 which cut my boot time to less than half (55 seconds to ~20 seconds).  I've now also swapped out my 5400RPM 1TB drive for an SSD and my boot time is now about 5 seconds.\n", "Q: texi2dvi with TeX 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2015) in R is not working In past I was using \ntexi2dvi(\"ABC.tex\", pdf = TRUE)\n\nin R to produce pdf from tex.

Now it just has plain purple screen. \nReboot and go into safemode, go into the command root and it has a freak out and the screen gets pixel lag and you can't see what's happening.\nI am looking for a definitive guide to getting this working. Don't skip anything as I am a complete noob. Don't link me to a guide, chances are I have read it! Please, please help me, you can understand the frustration of this.\n\nA: You could try installing the System76 driver. I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX970m graphics card on my laptop, and the regular Nvidia drivers also cause the purple screen you are describing. Sometimes Nvidia and Ubuntu do not get along well.\nhttp://docs.system76.com/articles/upgrade/\nsudo apt purge nvidia*\nrm ~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority ~/.config/monitors.xml\nReboot your machine, then:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia\nReboot again, see if it works. \n", "Q: How to effectively use the man pages? I am looking forward to mastering linux. I have been repeatedly told to refer to man pages when you are in doubt. \nThough I am very comfortable with the commandline, I find it very difficult to quickly and efficiently use man to find help with commands. Hence I end up googling up how to get things done. It is even more painful when the system I am using does not have internet access and I have to walk back to my office to get help from the internet.\nHow does one master man pages? What are the most common tricks that can be used to quickly get whatever you want from the man page? What are the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: Manual pages are essentially glorified help files. Their goal is to explain what programs do, and how to alter what they do through command-line flags and arguments.\nIf you look at the SYNOPSIS and OPTIONS sections of manpages, you will typically be able to understand enough about what your program does.\nDon't allow the \"technical\" wording of manpages to throw you off -- they were typically written by developers in a developer mindset. The more you read/use them, the better you'll get and the more you'll develop your own tricks to using man.\nIf you press the h key in man, you can get a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts (and general help) that will make your browsing (hopefully) faster. They're similar to the keystrokes for less, so it's essentially a 2-for-1.\nAnd, you can always refer to the manpage for man (man man) to get a quick rundown of man. You can't break man too badly, so just feel free to experiment and try out things.\n\nA: I recommend using apropos to help in searching the man files on the system more efficiently.\napropos can either search for everything with a word that matches in it, or you can look for specific by using the -e switch.\nExamples below:\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~$ apropos reboot\ngrub-reboot (8)      - set the default boot entry for GRUB, for the next boot...\nhalt (8)             - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\npoweroff (8)         - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\nreboot (2)           - reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del\nreboot (8)           - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\nrescan-scsi-bus.sh (8) - script for adding and removing SCSI devices without ...\nshutdown (8)         - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\nsystemd-reboot.service (8) - System shutdown logic\n\nor...\nterrance@terrance-Linux:~$ apropos -e reboot\nhalt (8)             - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\npoweroff (8)         - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\nreboot (2)           - reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del\nreboot (8)           - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\nshutdown (8)         - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\n\nAs you can see above that I got two different lists of commands resulting from searching for the reboot command.  The number in the ( ) is the section number.  The command reboot listed with 2 different numbers.  Any of the lines where it is not duplicated, only need to do man <command>, no need for the section number.\nTo open to the section, it would be the following command:\nman 2 reboot\n\nWhich will return this man page:\nREBOOT(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 REBOOT(2)\n\nNAME\n       reboot - reboot or enable/disable Ctrl-Alt-Del\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       /* For libc4 and libc5 the library call and the system call\n          are identical, and since kernel version 2.1.30 there are\n          symbolic names LINUX_REBOOT_* for the constants and a\n          fourth argument to the call: */\n\n       #include <unistd.h>\n       #include <linux/reboot.h>\n\n       int reboot(int magic, int magic2, int cmd, void *arg);\n\n       /* Under glibc and most alternative libc's (including uclibc, dietlibc,\n          musl and a few others), some of the constants involved have gotten\n          symbolic names RB_*, and the library call is a 1-argument\n          wrapper around the 3-argument system call: */\n\n       #include <unistd.h>\n\nor\nman 8 reboot\n\nwhich will return this man page:\nHALT(8)                              halt                              HALT(8)\n\nNAME\n       halt, poweroff, reboot - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       halt [OPTIONS...]\n\n       poweroff [OPTIONS...]\n\n       reboot [OPTIONS...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       halt, poweroff, reboot may be used to halt, power-off or reboot the\n       machine.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options are understood:\n\n       --help\n           Print a short help text and exit.\n\n       --halt\n\nTruncated above examples for space.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: One can also use man -k (or apropos) to find man pages that match text in the short description section of a manual, for example:\napropos directory\n\n..will find all the man pages with \"directory\" in the short description section of the manual.\n", "Q: New printer HP 5540 envy he scanner doesn't work Sorry,\nI've got the 14.04 version.\n\nA: It is not mattering if you use 14.04 Ubuntu or 15.04 Ubuntu or if this would concern 16.04 Ubuntu.\nOpen terminal and check if hplip is already installed. But first you need to switch on your brandish new printer. Plug-in the usb-cable into your Ubuntu-machine. Then reboot your Ubuntu-machine. When logged in after re-boot then open a terminal and type in (connected to internet):\n\nsudo apt-get install hplip\n\nYour machine is probably reporting that hplip is already installed.\nSo we do then :\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall hplip\n\nMachine is probably reporting that hplip is already installed but therefore we did reinstallation.\nThen you can run in terminal :\n\nsudo hp-setup -i\n\nYour printer should be recognized and set-up when you have followed the steps of hp-setup.

The my.cnf file is divided into several groups, one with options for the MySQL server, one with options for (command line) client, one with options for mysqldump and so on. If an option is outside of any such group, MySQL doesn't know what to apply it to. \nIf there's no \"unattributed\" option in your config, but MySQL still complains about one, you might want to look at the file's encoding.\n", "Q: How to list all enabled services from systemctl? How can I list all enabled services from systemctl?\nI know running systemctl command by itself lists all services, but I would like to only get the enabled ones.\n\nA: To list all the systemd service which are in state=active and sub=running\nsystemctl list-units --type=service --state=running\n\nTo list all the systemd serice which are in state=active and sub either running or exited\nsystemctl list-units --type=service --state=active\n\n\nA: systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled will list all enabled ones.\nIf you want which ones are currently running, you need systemctl | grep running.\nUse the one you're looking for.  Enabled, doesn't mean it's running.  And running doesn't mean it's enabled.  They are two different things.\nEnabled means the system will run the service on the next boot.  So if you enable a service, you still need to manually start it, or reboot and it will start.\nRunning means it's actually running right now, but if it's not enabled, it won't restart when you reboot.\n\nA: In addition to the current answers, I use the following to get just the names of the services:\nsystemctl list-units --type=service --state=active,running | awk '/.*\\.service/ {print $1}'\n\nRather than the tabular format, this makes it easier to pipe just those services to another program\n\nA: To see 'enabled' services including these that are still under upstart/init run:\nsystemctl list-unit-files --type service --state enabled,generated\n\nTo see all of the currently running services run:\nsystemctl list-units --type service --state running\n\n\nA: What about systemctl unit templates?\nTo list also templated units, you might want to use:\nsystemctl list-units --all|grep yourservice\nThe --all switch shows also all units which have been instantiated with\nsystemctl <service_name>@<argument>.service\nFrom the man page:\n\nWhen listing units with list-units, also show inactive units and units\nwhich are following other units. When showing unit/job/manager\nproperties, show all properties regardless whether they are set or\nnot.\n\nExample:\nsystemctl openvpn@my_office_endopoint.service\nFurther reading:\nhttps://fedoramagazine.org/systemd-template-unit-files/\n\nA: man systemctl states:\n\n--state=\nThe argument should be a comma-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE states. When listing units, show only those in the specified states. Use --state=failed to show only failed units.\n\nExplanation:\nLOAD: Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.\nACTIVE: The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.\nSUB: The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.\nThough you can also use this to only show enabled units with:\nsystemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled\n\nIf a unit is enabled that means that the system will start it on startup. Though setting something to enabled doesn't actually also start it so you will need to do that manually, or reboot the system after setting it to enabled.\n\nA: There is a good GUI application called Stacer where you can manage all the services.\n\nCheck its Github link Stacer Github\nAlso check Web for more info\n\nA: Also overview of all active and failed services:\nsystemctl list-units --type service --state running,failed\n\n", "Q: PHP upgrade from PHP 7.0.4 to PHP 7.0.8 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS I have to upgrade PHP version PHP 7.0.4 to PHP 7.0.8 in order to install third party software which only supported on PHP version 7.0.6 or later. \nroot@A# php -v\nPHP 7.0.4-7ubuntu2.1 (cli) ( NTS )\nCopyright (c) 1997-2016 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2016 Zend Technologies\n    with Zend OPcache v7.0.6-dev, Copyright (c) 1999-2016, by Zend Technologies\n\nI have used this repository and this doesn't have any PHP version 7.0.6 or later \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\n\n\n\n    root@Anish:/tmp# apt-get update \n    Hit:1 http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial InRelease                                             \n    Hit:2 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease                                                    \n    Get:3 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security InRelease [94.5 kB]\n    Get:4 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates InRelease [94.5 kB]        \n    Hit:5 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-backports InRelease                           \n    Get:6 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/main amd64 Packages [244 kB]\n    Get:7 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/main i386 Packages [240 kB]\n    Get:8 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-up\n\ndates/universe amd64 Packages [140 kB]\nGet:9 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/universe i386 Packages [137 kB]\nGet:10 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/universe Translation-en [69.9 kB]\nFetched 1,019 kB in 22s (45.2 kB/s)                              \nReading package lists...

I wanted to set up a home server for sharing data across a little home network for the several devices in our home (data like files, media, small stuff like that).\nI installed Ubuntu server on the laptop. It's strictly command line interface, and when trying to update and configure the server I realized it does not have any internet connection. It did during the initial install, but when I ping google, it says \"host unknown\" or something like that.\nSo I Googled and started reading guides about configuring the network, and I realize, I don't even known what it actually means to configure a network. Does this mean get a device hooked up to the internet? What does that actually imply?\nhttps://www.swiftstack.com/docs/install/configure_networking.html is the page I was following. The following is a list of instructions is says to follow:\n\nOpen your /etc/network/interfaces file, locate the:\n  \"iface eth0...\" line and change dynamic to static\n  address line and change the address to the static IP address\n  netmask line and change the address to the correct subnet mask\n  gateway line and change the address to the correct gateway address\n  dns-nameservers line and change (or add) the nameserver information\n  If you aren't certain which IP address, subnet mask, gateway or dns-nameservers you need, please consult with your network administrator for the correct information.\n\nI don't have a network admin to consult with because this is at my home. I am comfortable following these instructions from the command line, but what is a subnet mask? What is a gateway address? Nameserver information? I'm not sure what these things are, why I am changing them, or if any of this is going to get my server connected to my home wifi.\n\nA: A computer network consists of computer devices that are connected, so configuring a network would mean performing the necessary configuration of those devices to achieve the defined requirements for that network, which could involve hardware configuration(plugging cables, installing network interfaces) as well as software configuration(setting up rules for routers, configuring network services on hosts). Basically, it can be a lot of different stuff.\nThe linked instructions assume basic knowledge of computer networking, like what is the TCP/IP stack or OSI model and how they interoperate, which is part of the minimum knowledge for an entry-level position in a computer networking realated career, basics in other words. If you don't want to be confused, first that I suggest for you is filling in those blanks. I believe this article on howstuffworks.com explains it in sufficient detail without requiring much domain-specific knowledge. You can try looking for other network-related articles there or in other places on the web. Additional suggestion of mine is webopedia.com for looking up meaning of network-related terms terms explained in a simple language.\nThe instructions you linked describe just the software configuration that might be required to do on an Ubuntu device to ensure it is properly connected to a network, assuming all other devices are already set up properly. So, this configuration is necessary for your device to know how to connect to the network. Quick run-down of highlights:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checking current network configuration via commands and by looking at confguration files\n\n*DNS configuration(where to look up IP addresses for website names)\n\n*Interface configuration. Ethernet interface for example is where you plug in your ethernet cable. An IP address actually contains two datum: Network address and the device's address in that network. There is no unified boundary for every case between them. Subnet mask is used to determine where the former ends and latter begins. A network gateway is a gateway of sorts between your devices network and other networks. It routes communication back-and-forth between your device and devices in other networks. It is usually a dedicated device called router. The gateway address in the network is usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 by default, but default configuration could've been modified, so it's better to verify it yourself, either by checking what is the gateway address on other devices that are already connected to the network, or if you're its owner and/or the one who sets up the network by accessing router's configuration interface. How it's done varies between manufacturers, so it's better to consult the product user's guide, but often a web interface is available by connecting to the router directly with an Ethernet port and accessing some specific IP address or domain name in web browser. Watch out for unaffiliated domains.\n\n*Change name that identifies your device.\n\n", "Q: How can I enable auto-completion for the snap command?

Everything worked completely fine, but Grub wouldn't show Windows 8 in it's menu.\nSo I googled a solution, and found+used boot-repair.\nEven after the fix, Windows 8 wouldn't show up.\nI am 100% sure that Windows is still installed on a partition.\n(Please excuse any errors you may find, as I am not a native english speaker.)\n\nA: Probably this is only a spell-checking matter of Ubuntu or something has been overseen here :\nSo I assume that grub2 is installed already but Ubuntu is performing in the wrong way the command update-grub instead of update-grub2 ?!\nTry to run in terminal simply this command when you have entered your password after this, it should work and then you can re-boot your machine and Windows 8 should be visible in the boot-manager of grub2.\n\nsudo update-grub2 (and not: sudo update-grub)\n\nInform me, if this worked.\n\nA: You don't need to repair GRUB2. Your GRUB2 is fine, but it must be activated in UEFI.\n(Now that UEFI has replaced BIOS, GRUB2 can no longer install itself automatically. It must be activated. That is one part of what Microsoft calls \"Secure Boot\".)\nI recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 dual boot with Windows 10. After the Ubuntu install, Windows was still the only operating system seen at boot. To fix that I did the following:\nTo activate the Ubuntu bootloader (GRUB2) you must open the computer's UEFI (which has replaced BIOS) and look for the setting of bootloader. There is a choice between Windows and Ubuntu bootloader. When you change this setting from Windows to Ubuntu bootloader, all will work well: When you now turn on the computer, GRUB2 starts and you can choose to boot either Ubuntu or Windows.\nIt is a little \"tricky\" to enter UEFI in Windows 10 (or Windows 8). (You can not just turn on the power switch and hack on the escape/f2 key or similar, any more, like you did to enter the \"old\" BIOS.)\nTo enter UEFI, you must first start Windows. You then press restart of Windows and hold down the shift key at the same time. When the computer then restarts (with shift having been pressed down as you issued the command) you get several choices how to enter UEFI settings and choose bootloader (You should choose \"troubleshooting\"!).\nAnother way to make the computer do this kind of \"deep\" restart (and open UEFI) can be found under Windows settings (see below).\nThis (shift/restart) is also the way to make the computer boot from external media, like USB. (But then you don't choose \"troubleshooting\" when the computer restarts, then you choose the USB-boot option, of course.)\nSo I think you got Ubuntu and GRUB2 in place. You must just activate Ubuntu bootloader (instead of Windows) in UEFI (BIOS). \nI have not tried this in Win 8. But from what I Google you can open the UEFI in a similar way in Windows 8 as I just described for Windows 10.\nEdit:\nHere is how to enter UEFI in Windows 8 and 10, if you go via PC settings (and not just press shift/restart):\nWindows 8/8.1: Settings > Change PC Settings > General > Advanced startup > Restart Now > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings > Restart\nWindows 10: Start > Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Advanced startup > Restart now > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings > Restart\n", "Q: Help for suspending session or hibernating I installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nI want to put the system in suspend or hibernate mode and I have activated hibernation.

The \"U\" stands for \"Ultra-low power\", meaning that it's a notebook / laptop processor.\n\n*The third bit, \"2.20GHz\" is the speed of the processor, in this case, 2.2GHz, or 2 200 000 000 clock cycles per second.\n\n*The last bit, \"× 4\", is the number of physical & virtual cores the processor has. This particular CPU features HyperThreading, meaning that, even though it only has two physical cores, each of these is presented to the operating system as two separate cores (for a total of 4 cores), and, as a result, the OS (Linux / Ubuntu) can run four threads in total simultaneously, thus improving performance.\n\nA: To check out a CPU I would recommend Wikipedia's lists of Intel processors. You can also check /proc/cpuinfo e.g. by using cat /proc/cpuinfo in a Terminal/Shell.\nOne of the search results for \"i5-5200U\" on en.wikipedia.org is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_microprocessors\nSo you can see it is a \"Broadwell-U\" (dual-core, 14 nm) and the flags implemented, as shown by /proc/cpuinfo.\nYou might want to use Ctrl + F \"i5-5200U\" on the list in Wikipedia, then you find the number of cores, etc. in the corresponding table.\nI guess using /proc/cpuinfo is faster and on Wikipedia you can read more about the background of the cpu, etc..\nYou can see /proc/cpuinfo lists \"cpu cores : 2\" - Your CPU uses Hyper-threading, so the CPU runs 4 Threads simultaneously (every core runs 2 threads). If something is unclear I recommend Wikipedia.\n\nA: I'd personally use cpuid, this converts a lot of the CPU flags into more meaningful information:\nsudo apt-get install cpuid\ncpuid\n\n", "Q: Deleting standard browser Is there any difference between this command:\napt-get purge firefox \nand these 2 commands:\nsudo apt-get remove firefox && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove firefox just uninstalls Firefox. \nsudo apt-get purge firefox also deletes configuration files.\nsudo apt-get autoremove removes packages that were automatically\ninstalled to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no\nlonger needed.\n", "Q: If I only use when needed, does enabling the \"su\" account present dangers?

So having limited privileges is better.\n\nA: Yes, it is a security risk\nWhen you are using a root user, all the applications run with root privileges too. There are not that many viruses for Linux OS (at least compared to Windows), but every single vulnerability in apps now pose a bigger risk than with limited privileges. In the worst case scenario, those vulnerabilities may result in destruction of your system/personal stuff (erasing system files, your data files etc). Bugs and vulnerabilities may appear in any app, such as Firefox that you may use to browse the Internet.\nWhat is more, it is easy to make harm on your computer as a root. The person doesn't have to be a newbie to Linux, due to the fact that we are just humans, a little mistyping of commands may have severe aftermath. Since root doesn't need to type password, you are basically one command away from destruction..\nI would  recommend using sudo commandinstead of switching to root when running administrative tasks occasionally.\nHere's another post in this forum related to this subject (see the link below)\nWhy is it bad to login as root?\n", "Q: How to fix missing characters from font after awakening from suspend? I find that often after awakening from suspend on Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20 (I have only found this issue on the latest version, though I have not tried with GNOME 3.18 on 16.04) that I get this strange font issue which can't be fixed by restarting gnome-shell and seemingly only by restarting my entire machine:\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not believe that this is a theme issue as I have tried all the built-in themes (including the dark and light versions) and it is the same for them all.

Hi fellow ubuntu users,\nI was looking into using several Ubuntu desktops as a Beowulf cluster.\nBut this seemed complicated, or I am too lazy to get into it :) and mmost of the software is outdated.\nThen I stumbled unto MAAS and that looked like exactly what I was looking for.\nThe reason I wanted to build a beowulf cluster is so I can run a cpu heavy program on several nodes. How can I tell MAAS how to run it, or would I have to use Juju in conjunction?\nPlease let me now, I love the idea. Just have problems grasping the possibilities.\nThanks people!\n\nA: Well, this is an interesting set of questions :)\nFirst, there is no way to take a standard app and spread it across many machines to make it faster. You do have some apps which are designed to be spread across several machines, and those can be used very easily with MAAS and Juju to coordinate the deployment and operations of the distributed system. But you can't take your standard database and spread it across multiple machines magically, it needs to be a database that was designed for that kind of operation.\nMAAS is the piece that will turn on servers, install the OS (Ubuntu, CentOS or Windows) and then give the machine back to you. Your configuration management tools (e.g. Chef) or model-driven operations tools (Juju) will then take the brand-new fresh OS and add all the applications and configuration you want.\n", "Q: Deleting uneccessary kernels I installed synaptic package manager to manage my packages and, I see many kernels, that are not being used, can I delete them?

Ubuntu (and other linuxes) are keeping 2 or more kernel versions installed at all times as backup. If one kernel fails for any number of reasons, the next one will automatically boot instead.

So, please be gentle. Also, I'm determined to learn as much as I can, so if you can direct me to any documentation or tutorials that would assist with this, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Using the GUI\nThe GUI doesn't have much options, the most you can do is go to the Scheduling tab and set the Keep setting to either \"At least a year\" or \"At least 6 months\". The application will manage storage space, by deleting old backups when it finds that the storage is low on space.\n\nCommand Line\nIf you are comfortable with the command line, you can run the following command in the terminal:\nduplicity remove-older-than <time> [options] [--force] target_url\n\nYou can find more details about the options, and what you can do from the command line by running man duplicity.\nTo quote the manual:\n\nremove-older-than\nDelete all backup sets older than the given time.  Old backup sets will not be deleted if backup sets newer than time depend on them.  See the TIME FORMATS section for more information.  Note, this action cannot be combined with backup or other actions, such as cleanup.  Note also that --force will be needed to delete the files instead of just listing them.\n\nThe documentation of time and target_url are a bit large to include in here. However, here is a summary of their description available from error message.\n\ntime\nThe acceptible [sic] time strings are intervals (like \"3D64s\"), w3-datetime strings, like \"2002-04-26T04:22:01-07:00\" (strings like \"2002-04-26T04:22:01\" are also acceptable - duplicity will use the current time zone), or ordinary dates like 2/4/1997 or 2001-04-23 (various combinations are acceptable, but the month always precedes the day).\ntarget_url\nBad URL '/home/dan/deja-dup/'.\nExamples of URL strings are \"scp://user@host.net:1234/path\" and \"file:///usr/local\".  See the man page for more information.\n\nSo as an example, to clean backups older than than the 1st of February 2016 in the ~/deja-dup directory, you can use the following command:\nduplicity remove-older-than 2016-02-01 file:///home/$USER/deja-dup/\n\nNote: This may not delete them directly if some of the matched backup are full backups that subsequent incremental backups may depend on them.\nAlso, according to the manual, this would only list the files that will be deleted. You will need to append the command with --force for the files to be deleted.\nDéjà Dup uses duplicity as its backend (This means that it is basically a User Interface for duplicity).\n\nA: If you delete ~/deja-dup and its content you will only use past backups. If you feel that you don't need them any longer (or not as much as the storage space they occupy), you can delete them safely.\nI don't know about the files on the external drive because I don't know their names or what they are. If they have very similar names to the files in ~/deja-dup, the same as above applies.\n", "Q: AMD GPU driver installation on Kubuntu 16.04? How to install AMD GPU drivers on 16.04? My GPU is a Radeon HD 7640G+HD 7670M dual graphics.\n\nA: You cannot install additional AMD drivers in 16.04.  There is just no support or proprietary drivers for it, and as of this writing, there is still no plan to make any, or to further support AMD card beyond the existing opensource drivers.\nEven if you do manage to mangle an install and make it run, it will likely break the system.\nThe issue with the open source drivers in 16.04 is power management, or lack thereof, for many cards.  Having a hybrid card means you will be running both at all times with no ability to power down the one not in use.

My third WiFi adapter is a generic brand rt3070/rt2800usb driver. The reasoning behind the different chipset versions is to identify which chipsets work best in certain situations. Now my problem is that the third WiFi adapter rt3070/rt2800usb won't connect to WiFi(wlan3,4,ect..). My concern is if I make any modifications will that limit my use of other chipset versions, is the rt3070 a usable chipset version. Any help would be great. \n\nA: A rookie mistake.

That's not my issue.   I've made the appropriate changes to the BIOS and the Lenovo machine can boot fine, at least initially, from the bootable media.\nMy problem is that the installer either never completely loads or loads but does not get past a certain point.  The situations I have encountered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 (32-bit) off of a USB stick loads properly, recognizes the hard disk, and even gets to the \"Who Are You?\" stage where you enter your desired username, password, machine name etc.; however, when I click \"Continue\" on that screen it never gets to the sequence of splash screens where the installer says it is copying files and tells you how awesome Ubuntu is; the hard disk just spins and spins for hours; hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1 at this stage does not give me any usable data\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 (32-bit) off of a DVD begins loading the installer but doesn't load the GUI; instead, it exits to a terminal session; the messages in the terminal are inconsistent (I've done this 4 or 5 times); a couple of times, something to do with loading graphics is reported as FAIL, which makes sense given that it could not load the GUI, but I can't understand why this failure would occur (especially given that the GUI for the installer displays correctly off of the USB for 14.04 32-bit)\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit) off of a DVD has the same issue as Ubuntu 12 (32-bit) directly above\nAny ideas?\n\nA: As per DougSmythies' comment, the Intel i7 vPro chip (a \"skylake\" processor) does not seem to respect prior versions of Ubuntu.\nUbuntu 16.04 64-bit installed without a hiccup.\nPost-installation, the OS runs mostly fine, but it does have some issues (it stalls on loading sometimes or cannot get past the login screen on some other tries).  But having started the machine about 30 times since installation, these hangs seem to be random and infrequent.  Still, they might point to some residual incompatibility between the OS and the chip.\n", "Q: Uninstall OpenCV - Ubuntu keeps asking for permission I am installing caffe and I think I screwed up my install by having multiple versions of OpenCV. Now I don't know what I did on my own but I might have done something wrong and nothing is working.

How to uninstall OpenCV 2.4.9 completely from Ubuntu?\nbut when I type:  \nsudo find / -name \"*opencv*\" -exec rm -i {} \\;\n\nUbuntu still keeps asking me for permission to remove every file.\nHow do I tell Ubuntu to remove it all without permission because there are a lot of files?\npermission:\n\n\nA: Quick solution\nRemove the -i flag from the rm command invoked from find -exec.\nElegant solution\nDon't use -exec rm at all but the -delete action of find instead.\nAdvice for both cases…\nYou should probably run find without a destructive action like -exec rm or -delete first to verify that it won't delete precious files.\nWhat you really want…\nis to uninstall a botched OpenCV installation. The deinstallation procedure depends on how it was installed in the first place. Please open a new question for that and line out how OpenCV was installed.\n\nA: Remove the -i flag in your command. Please make sure you want to remove all files whose names contain opencv before running the command.\n", "Q: Why a prompt to Update 14.04 to 15.10? I am trying to eventually update to 16.04 from 14.04. I'd prefer not to do a fresh install nor backup my installation (my data is backed up at SpiderOak...)\nDo I have to... or is it easiest to update first to 14.10 and then 15.04 and so on? If this is the case, if the problems or \"damage\" will occur otherwise, why, after running update-manager, do I only get a prompt to  update straight to 15.10?\nCan I just update LTS version to LTS version without going through the x.10 releases? How do I do this, or do what's best? Thanks!\n\nA: Upgrading directly should work fine (14.10 and 15.04 are EOL anyway). However, LTS to LTS upgrades won't show up until the first point release (\"first point release\" in this case meaning 16.04.1). You can override this and upgrade anyway by running do-release-upgrade -d in the terminal, but it's typically better to wait for the first point release, which is scheduled for July 21st. \n\nA: You can directly upgrade from a LTS version (14.04 in your case) to the first point release of the next LTS version (16.04.1) by running:\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nNote that, however, the first point release of 16.04 is not out yet. If you still want to upgrade to 16.04 before then, you add the -d option to the previous command:\ndo-release-upgrade -d\n\n", "Q: Open GUI apps on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine via SSH from an Ubuntu 14.04 machine I'm trying to open GUI apps (gedit/nautilus/firefox) on a 16.04 machine via SSH from a 14.04 machine.

Can someone help me resolve this?\n\nA: The accepted answer works, however according to Launchpad Bugs, the real cause is libepoxy.  libepoxy has been fixed since early 2017, but as of June 2017, it is not available as an updated package for 16.04.  I followed the instructions by Raj Bhattacharjea to fix this issue.

As much as I don't like using a package from another version, this seems like the cleaner solution, especially since I don't have to worry about my link breaking if I change NVidia versions.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I ran strace with meld and gedit and it indicated that for some reason there was problem finding libGLX_indirect.so.0 library. I attempted a fix by placing relevant symbolic link inside /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu folder:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/nvidia-361/libGLX_indirect.so.0\n\nand it works now. Would like to know what is the preferred way of fixing it.\n", "Q: Computer architecture - can I run a 64-bit OS?

menu with right click on it, which opens MenuLibre editor, what he gets is a completely screwed up menu.\nTry to edit your menu by using application Alacarte instead of Menulibre. It should repair it; it has a button to restore the default menu.  (If you can't find Alacarte inside your menu, just run the command alacarte in a terminal emulator.  If it's not installed, install it by running sudo apt-get install alacarte)\nFor those who want the technical details, this known issue is a currently confirmed bug for MenuLibre:\nA possible explanation is given there in the bug report:\n\nIt seems menulibre uses the system menufile /etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu rather than the file pointed to by session which is /etc/xdg/xdg-ubuntustudio/menus/xfce-applications.menu. This is the file the session runs on and whisker and the application menu use. menulibre does not use this.\nAlso menulibre makes its own whole new menu spec rather than just changing the parts of the menu you ask for. This is just wrong. I would suggest either doing these changes by hand or using alacart (alacart has problems as well) Ubuntustudio should remove menulibre from its list of applications.\n\n", "Q: store doesn't find non-installed applications I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04 and I noticed when I launched the store with no problem, it wasn't finding anything that wasn't already installed on the machine. Not Chromium, Steam, or anything. It just comes up with the nothing found screen like I typed in gibberish or something. I am connected to the internet and firefox does fully work.\n\nA: It looks like all the store needed was the machine to reboot. Its working now, although slow.\n", "Q: Log file eating up whole space in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Fix? I have recently got into Linux and it's dual booted in my pc with windows 10. I installed a few files in Ubuntu 16.04 and a space of 41 GB is allotted for Ubuntu in my pc. But all of a sudden a prompt came up that I don't have much space remaining. After some looking, I found it's eaten mostly by the log files, more specifically the \"syslog.1\" file. I am pretty sure there's a mess in my apps and it's logging those problems repeatedly. I will remove most of the apps and start again. \nBut for now, how do I clean this file and free the 37 GB space that it has been eating up?\nWill this help? I found this on a forum.\nsudo gzip syslog.1\n\nUpdate:\nThe above code has worked by compressing the 37 GB log file to about 800 MB. However, I am looking for a permanent solution to find the errors causing the log file to enlarge. I have also installed a lot of .deb files. And they have a lot of unmet dependencies which need to be downloaded.\n How do I revert this action and remove the files which have unmet dependencies?\nI have also tried:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nThese don't seem to work. \n\nA: A 37GB log file is a problem in itself, especially if the system is only days old. You have to monitor the log file to see what's going on. Best is to delete the old file, as it's too big to handle. Then you can install logrotate. With it you can clean up logfiles. It can \"rotate\" log files daily, weekly or whatever you want. In your case it should be daily. Then you specify how many logfiles you want to keep, plus you need to zip the old ones. \nThat 37GB file is zipped only 4GB, so will cause no problems even if you have to keep five of them. That would still be extreme, but this is just to give you an idea of what logrotation can do. \nBelow you can see my logrotate config for Apache, with compression and delayed compression. It keeps the logs for 14 days. For your log you should google what a good configuration is. \n/var/log/apache2/*.log {\n        daily\n        missingok\n        rotate 14\n        compress\n        delaycompress\n        notifempty\n        create 640 root adm\n        sharedscripts\n        postrotate\n                if /etc/init.d/apache2 status > /dev/null ; then \\\n                    /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null; \\\n                fi;\n        endscript\n        prerotate\n                if [ -d /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate ]; then \\\n                        run-parts /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate; \\\n                fi; \\\n        endscript\n}\n\nWhen all is working well, you can set the logrotation back to 30 days or something. \nOh and if this is not the system you use daily, run the logrotate job manually. If the cronjob is set to run at 3 in the morning, it will probably not run, and your problem will continue to exist.\nUpdate\nYou need to add compress to your logrotate config. You can add this to all configs in /etc/logrotate.d. For logs that are too big now, delete them or compress them like you did. 800MB is still too much considering you will never do anything with it, so delete it: sudo rm syslog.1.gz, and delete anything that is too big. \n\nA: Simply you can manage it by using logrotate with the following code in vi etc/logrotate.conf:\n/var/log/syslog1\n{\n     daily\n\n     size 100 M(/* It can be k ,M ,G etc*/)\n\n     compress\n\n     postrotate\n         cat /dev/null >/var/log/syslog1 (/* It will make log file null*/)\n     endscript\n\n     mail xyz@example.com\n     rotate 4         \n}\n\nYou can also find it out your bigger file in size by :\ndu -a /var | sort -n -r | head -n 10\n\n", "Q: How to copy a folder to multiple folders using command line? I want to copy a specific folder from one point to another and I have more the 300 destination folder where I want to copy that specific folder.\nCan anybody assist me with a proper solution? \nshell script suggestion would be great.\n\nA: The core of a function I have in my .bashrc for this is this:\necho $destinations | xargs -n 1 cp $sourcefile\n\n(I think I got that from this answer) If the destinations are in destinations.txt, just replace echo $destinations with cat destinations.txt Filenames with spaces will give you issues unless they're quoted in the input, so be wary of that.\nHere's the full function from my .bashrc.

It seems the problem is that the sys schema database was never created, so here's the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone https://github.com/mysql/mysql-sys and cd into the cloned folder.\n\n*In a terminal, run mysql -u root -p < ./sys_57.sql (or sys_56.sql, depending on your version)\n\n*Enjoy mysql_upgrade working again.\n\n\nI guess this probably was, as @skerit said, an upgrading scripts mess-up.\n\nA: Someone messed up the upgrade scripts, and in an LTS release no less.\nThe main problem lies in the upgrading of the system schema. If you don't want to delete all your data, you can force the update like this:\nmysql_upgrade -uroot -p --verbose --skip-sys-schema\n\nThis is a dirty workaround, of course, since the system schema is now not what it's supposed to be, but at least you can continue using mysql.\n\nA: I removed only /var/lib/mysql/sys dir and then ran this command:\nmysql_update -u root -p\n\nAll went fine.\n\nA: I finally remove everything mysql components ( mysql-server, mysql-server-5.7, mysql-server-core-5.7 ) and data ( /var/lib/mysql  , /etc/mysql ) and do a fresh install of it .\nEverythings works fine now.\nI thing the mysql internal dbs were somehow corrupted or with data missing during the migration from 5.6 to 5.7 ( from the change log , the column password from user table has been  deleted for a new one )\nhope it will help\n", "Q: Unknown error -1 when trying to mount an .img file I'm in a folder where is the system.img.\nI want to mount it in a subfolder named system\nI'm doing this command on ubuntu 15.04 server, that is proven working on Linux Mint 17.3\nsudo mount -t ext4 -o loop system.img system/\n\nBut I got this error on my Ubuntu sever:\n\nmount: system/: mount failed: Unknown error -1\n\nI'm not able to diagnose what could be the problem.\nFor your info :\nsudo fdisk -lu system.img\nDisk system.img: 1.9 GiB, 2013143040 bytes, 3931920 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\n\nAlready tried using -t auto\nsudo mount -t auto -o loop system.img system/\nmount: system/: mount failed: Unknown error -1\n\nDmsg after mount tempt is empty:\n# sudo mount -t ext4 -o loop system.img system/\nmount: system/: mount failed: Unknown error -1\n# sudo dmesg | tail\n#\n\nFree space is enough:\ndf -H\nFilesystem         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/ploop23074p1   11G  6.9G  3.1G  70% /\n\nBefore you ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*the .img file is ok [checked file sha1]\n\n*the same img file can be mounted on the Mint distro\n\n*the system subfolder doesn't exists\n\n\nA: At the end, I tried with a machine with more RAM and I got no more problems.\nSo definetively, 512 MB of RAM for Ubuntu 15.04 is too less for my purposes.\n", "Q: How can I make my tftp server visible/available on my local network?

I strongly suggest that you use a recent version of the program (maybe 2016a, since we are here), in order to maintain compatibility with the systems you are using.

Unchecking the Podcast feature in Preferences fixed it. \nThanks!\n\nA: :( Unfortunately the next time ( see comments above) I tried to rescan the music library Banshee froze again. \nI like to play albums which I browse using cover art - I gave up & tried  \n\n\n*\n\n*Rhythmbox - the cover art plugin crashed it\n\n*Tomahawk - downloads the cover art it can find but doesn't seem to read what's actually there, so it shows a lot of blanks\n\n*Lollypop - which I liked a lot because you could browse cover art arranged in artist order, but which multiplied compilation albums (& even some non-compilation albums) over many covers with no obvious solution.\nSo I went back to Banshee. Purged it, deleted the ./config/banshee-1 file, rebooted & then re-installed it. So far so good. \nSo maybe my problem was buried in the installation or the config file. \nLater:\nUh-oh, this seems familiar. this time i repeated the process & deleted the DAAP extension.\n\nA: I had the same problems with Banshee 2.6.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.

Under the view tab tick the box to (show hidden and backup files) then scroll down and open the folder called .config. Find the folder called banshee-1. and open that folder also and delete all of the files and folders inside. Again go to the tool bar above click on edit then preferences\nand under the view tab untick the box to show hidden and backup files, and then close all the windows.\nIf your also having problems importing media to the player do the following.\nOpen the Banshee player then go to the tool bar and click on edit then in the drop-down choose preferences. Click on the extensions tab in the open window and untick everything.\nUnder the context pain tick wikipedia, under core tick DVD and audio cd support,under utilities tick cover art fetching, library watcher, MPRIS D-Bus interface and sound menu integration.\nI tried putting the extensions back to default but it crashed again, I'm not sure whats causing it so as I don't need any more extensions I've left them unticked. As you can see by the screenshot it worked for me.\nBanshee Screenshot\n\nA: I was having the same issue importing media and getting stuck.

After installation, boot Ubuntu and install the nvidia-367 drivers. Once that's done, you can plug your motherboard back into the the GPU and use Ubuntu. \nHere's the PPA you need for nvidia-367: https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nOne problem I haven't solved is that the monitor turns off while Ubuntu is loading. It turns back on at the login screen. Not sure why :/\n\nA: Following the other instructions here (ppa and install nvidia-367) worked for me but I didn't need integrated graphics or a live CD. This worked for me - I was replacing a GTX 960 with the GTX 1080:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select one of the recovery entries in GRUB (under advanced)\n\n*Select root prompt\n\n*Remount filesystem with read/write access: mount -o remount,rw /\n\n*Do apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\n*reboot\n\n*Select your normal Ubuntu entry in GRUB, I was then able to login albeit with a weird resolution\n\n*Run the ppa instructions as described in the other answers:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt install nvidia-367\n\nIts probably also possible to do it directly in the root prompt if you know how to get the network up.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Nvidia GTX 1080 and Ubuntu Budgie 17.04. \nI have no integtated Graphics available.\nMy LAN is connected via DHCP to the internet.\nMy walkthrough how I got it running:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu minimal installer (Link to ubuntu.com) and create a bootable usb stick\n\n*Choose \"Install ubuntu\" when booting from your boot usb stick and follow the instructions of the text installer (in one step you can choose your preferred desktop environment - in my case ubuntu Budgie)\n\n*After installing reboot via rescue mode (there's an entry in GRUB)\n\n*choose \"command line prompt\" in the rescue mode menu\n\n*Type sudo ip -o link and look what's the name of your ethernet adapter\n\n*Type sudo dhclient write-here-name-of-your-ethernet-adapter\n\n*Then type sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\n*Then type sudo apt-get update\n\n*Then type sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\n*If everything is installed and you have your command line prompt again, type reboot\nNow the X-Server should work as expected with the GTX 1080 \n\nA: I agree with sargunster's method if your CPU comes with the integrated graphic unit.\nIf you are using Xeon or other systems without other dedicated graphic controller, you can follow my method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB loaded with Ubuntu server image.\n\n*Install the Ubuntu server. If you cannot boot into the system after the installation (displaying fb characteristic error), you can add nomodeset to the kernel flags.\n\n*Once reach the command prompt, login the system and add nvidia proprietary driver repository.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install nvidia-367\n\n*Install Ubuntu or Kubuntu desktop as you wish.\nsudo apt install ubuntu-desktop\nor\nsudo apt install kubuntu-desktop\n\n*You will be asked to select display manager between lightdm or sddm. I personally perfer using sddm. \n\n*You are allowed to boot into graphical user interface after the reboot.\n\nA: Sounds like to me its a driver issue. Try setting up a live cd and installing nvidia drivers and see if that resolves the issue. Im just guessing at the moment, i would wait for more responses to see if this is a known issue.\nlink; https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery\n\nA: If you already have an OS Installed and are upgrading to the GTX 1080, you could boot into the OS Using the older gpu (with the 1080 plugged in), and then install the new drivers. No need for a live OS. Worked for me\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt install nvidia-367\n\n\nA: The screen turns black because the screen connected to the gpu. Do connect to motherboard before installing the driver. Then, use the nvidia provided download rather than ppa. I solved this issue for my pc, but I don't remember the step correctly.\np/s: You may turn off the intel or anything gpu in the boot. rather than use the nouveau thing. \n", "Q: formatting with awk I have this text:\nCore/Dev\nCore/master\nFrontEnd/Dev\nFrontEnd/DoubleClick\nFrontEnd/HEAD -> FrontEnd/master\nFrontEnd/master\nInfrastructure/Dev\nInfrastructure/master\nSoftware/Dev\nSoftware/Control\nSoftware/master\n\nI want to achieve this:\nCore:Dev,master\nFrontEnd:Dev,DoubleClick,master\nInfrastructure:Dev,master\nSoftware:Dev,Control,master\n\nNotice all lines with the same start are combined and the values are comma-seperated,\nand the line with HEAD is ignored.\nWhat's the best way to do this, sed or awk? and how?\nThanks.\n\nA: I suggest awk for this case.

I've been studying about the command line and learned that | (pipeline) is meant to redirect the output from a command to the input of another one.\nSo why does the command ls | file doesn't work?\nfile input is one of more filenames, like file filename1 filename2\nls output is a list of directories and files on a folder, so I thought ls | file was supposed to show the file type of every file on a folder.\nWhen I use it however, the output is:\n    Usage: file [-bcEhikLlNnprsvz0] [--apple] [--mime-encoding] [--mime-type]\n        [-e testname] [-F separator] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] file ...\n    file -C [-m magicfiles]\n    file [--help]\n\nAs there was some error with the usage of the file command\n\nA: The fundamental issue is that file expects file names as command-line arguments, not on stdin. When you write ls | file the output of ls is being passed as input to file. Not as arguments, as input.\nWhat's the difference?\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-line arguments are when you write flags and file names after a command, as in cmd arg1 arg2 arg3. In shell scripts these arguments are available as the variables $1, $2, $3, etc. In C you'd access them via the char **argv and int argc arguments to main().\n\n*Standard input, stdin, is a stream of data. Some programs like cat or wc read from stdin when they're not given any command-line arguments. In a shell script you can use read to get a single line of input. In C you can use scanf() or getchar(), among various options.\nfile does not normally read from stdin. It expects at least one file name to be passed as an argument. That's why it prints out usage when you write ls | file, because you didn't pass an argument.\nYou could use xargs to convert stdin into arguments, as in ls | xargs file. Still, as terdon mentions, parsing ls is a bad idea. The most direct way to do this is simply:\nfile *\n\n\nA: \nlearned that '|' (pipeline) is meant to redirect the output from a command to the input of another one.\n\nIt doesn't \"redirect\" the output, but takes the output of a program and use it as input, while file doesn't take inputs but filenames as arguments, which are then tested. Redirections do not pass these filenames as arguments neither piping does, the later what you are doing.\nWhat you can do is read the filenames from a file with the --files-from option if you have a file which list all files you want to test, otherwise just pass the paths to your files as arguments.\n\nA: The accepted answer explains why the pipe command doesn't work straightaway, and with the file * command, it offers a simple, straightforward solution. \nI'd like to suggest another alternative that might come in handy at some time. The trick is using the backtick (`) character. The backtick is explained in great detail here. In short, it takes the output of the command enclosed in the backticks and substitutes it as a string into the remaining command. \nSo, find `ls` will take the output of the ls command, and substitute it as arguments for the find command. This is longer and more complicated than the accepted solution, but variants of this may be helpful in other situations.\n\nA: The output of ls through a pipe is a solid block of data with 0x0a separating each line - ie a linefeed character - and file gets this as one parameter, where it expects multiple characters to work on one at a time.\nAs a general rule, never use ls to generate a data source for other commands - one day it'll pipe .. into rm and then you're in trouble!\nBetter to use a loop, such as for i in *; do file \"$i\" ; done which will produce the output you want, predictably. The quotes are there in case of filenames with spaces.\n\nA: If you want to use a pipe to feed file use the option -f which is normally followed by a filename but you can also use a single hyphen - to read from stdin, so\n$ ls\ncow.pdf  some.txt\n$ ls | file -f -\ncow.pdf:       PDF document, version 1.4\nsome.txt:        ASCII text\n\nThe trick with the hyphen - works with a lot of the standard command-line utils (although it is -- sometimes), so it is always worth a try.\nThe tool xarg is much more powerful and in most cases only needed if the argument-list is too long (see this post for details).\n\nA: It works use command like below\nls | xargs file\n\nIt will work better to me\n\nA: Because, as you say, the input of file has to be filenames. The output of ls, however, is just text. That it happens to be a list of file names doesn't change the fact that it is simply text and not the location of files on the hard drive. \nWhen you see output printed on the screen, what you see is text. Whether that text is a poem or a list of filenames makes no difference to the computer. All it knows is that it is text. This is why you can pass the output of ls to programs that take text as input (although you really, really shouldn't):\n$ ls / | grep etc\netc\n\nSo, to use the output of a command that lists file names as text (such as ls or find) as input for a command that takes filenames, you need to use some tricks. The typical tool for this is xargs:\n$ ls\nfile1 file2\n\n$ ls | xargs wc\n 9  9 38 file1\n 5  5 20 file2\n14 14 58 total\n\nAs I said before, though, you really don't want to be parsing the output of ls. Something like find is better (the print0 prints a \\0 instead of a newilne after each file name and the -0 of xargs lets it deal with such input; this is a trick to make your commands work with filenames containing newlines):\n$ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 wc\n 9  9 38 ./file1\n 5  5 20 ./file2\n14 14 58 total\n\nWhich also has its own way of doing this, without needing xargs at all:\n$ find . -type f -exec wc {} +\n 9  9 38 ./file1\n 5  5 20 ./file2\n14 14 58 total\n\nFinally, you can also use a shell loop. However, note that in most cases, xargs will be much faster and more efficient. For example:\n$ for file in *; do wc \"$file\"; done\n 9  9 38 file1\n 5  5 20 file2\n\n\nA: This should also work:  \nfile $(ls)\n\nas also discussed here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5778/whats-the-difference-between-stuff-and-stuff\n", "Q: How to run a Java awt Hedless program in a server environment?

The reason why it doesn't is probably due to access rights - you need to log into X to be able to display anything on it. That's what I meant when talking about permissions.\nRecommended solution\nAnother (probably better) way to deal with it and that I've used a long time ago, is to use a virtual X server like Xvfb (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb)\nIt acts as a X server, but performs no operations. Then your application should be happy with it. It's actually one of the use cases listed on the Wikipedia entry for it.\nTo use it, you need to do the following:\nsudo apt-get install xvfb\nxvfb-run [your command]\n\nOne word of caution though: there may be a reason for your programs to want an X server. It may actually need some level of user interaction through it, and if that is the case, not being able to see what's going on will make the program useless...\nI'd recommend looking for information with the program's maker, or other users of this program, rather than the Ubuntu community.\n", "Q: Ubuntu in VMware player won't detect multiple screens anymore I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 running inside VMPlayer 7.0.0 (on Windows 7), and I don't see any of my screens (I'm using 3: the laptop's built-in and two via hdmi).\nI'm running open-vm-tools, open-vm-tools-desktop and open-vm-tools-dev.\n\nAny idea ?\n\nA: This is a known issue with the kernel that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 (4.4, I believe), in combination with open-vm-tools.\nUpgrading the kernel to 4.6 fixed this issue for me.\nHere are the upgrade steps:\nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/05/install-linux-kernel-4-6-ubuntu-16-04/\n", "Q: apt-get failure while processing number of python packages How do I clean it up?\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n python-cairo\n python-gobject-2\n python-gtk2\n python-numpy\n python-sqlalchemy\n python-pygame\n childsplay\n childsplay-alphabet-sounds-ca\n python-pysqlite2\n gcompris\n python-configparser\n python-lzma\n python-sqlalchemy-ext\n youtube-dl\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\nskumaran@hamming:~$ \n\nMy full error log is here:\nhttp://pastebin.com/1c6cZz34\nHow do I clean up my system so that it does not give this error while installing software.\nMy active python is python3.4\nskumaran@hamming:~/workspace$ /usr/bin/python --version\nPython 3.4.5rc1\nskumaran@hamming:~/workspace$ head -1 /usr/bin/pycompile \n#! /usr/bin/python\nskumaran@hamming:~/workspace$ \n\n\nA: Ubuntu depends on /usr/bin/python being Python2.

This means that Lubuntu and Kubuntu will be completely separate, on two different partitions. However, you can share data between them, e.g. with a shared partition for data, or by directly copying files from one partition to the other. This may use less resources (memory) than the other ways, but will use more disk space.\nTo set this up, just install one Ubuntu flavor first (e.g Lubuntu), and then install the other one (Kubuntu). The Kubuntu installer will give you the option to install side-by-side.\n\n\n*The other way to do this would be to install LXDE and KDE side-by-side, in one installation. So you could install Lubuntu, and then install KDE. You can then choose which desktop environment to start when you login. Data, applications, and so on, are shared between both desktop environments.\nThis will, in fact, not use significantly more resources - if you are using LXDE, only LXDE components loaded, and the same for KDE, so you won't see a significant increase in used memory or CPU resources.\nThe third possibility:\n\n*\n\n*Would be to use a VM anyway - with a Core i3, and at least 3GB of RAM, it won't be a problem - I used to run Windows 7 in a VM on a Core2 Duo, with 2GB of ram, no problem. A VM would only use resources when it's running.\n\n\nA: Three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xenserver and run Lubuntu and Kubuntu with hardware passthrough to each simultaneously, spinning down one or the other as necessary (I am willing to bet your i3 will actually handle this nicely)\n\n*Install KDE on Lubuntu and switch DEs at the login screen\n\n*Install Kubuntu alongside Lubuntu and dual-boot using GRUB to select your OS of choice at boot time.  \n", "Q: Permitting scp but not ssh - without scponly I'm migrating a Debian server to Ubuntu 16.04. One of the packages on the Debian server is scponly which acts as a shell and permits ssh connections for scp purposes only (not login or running anything other than the scp binary). Details can be found here. This package has been on the Debian through at least 2 physical server upgrades already, countless OS upgrades, and probably dates from about 2007.\nscponly is not in any 16.04 repository, and isn't compiled on launchpad. Whilst I am quite capable of installing it from source, this got me wondering whether in the last 10+ years there is a better way of configuring ssh to permit scp commands only, that is more Ubuntu 16.04 friendly, and less based in the dim and distant past. Any ideas?\n\nA: According to this serverfault.com answer Allow SCP but not actual login using SSH, one currently supported way is by using rssh, which is available from the universe repository:\nsudo apt-add-repository universe\n\nsudo apt-get install rssh\n\nTo allow SCP, you must uncomment the corresponding line in the /etc/rssh.conf file (plus any other protocols you wish to enable):\nallowscp\n#allowsftp\n#allowcvs\n#allowrdist\n#allowrsync\n#allowsvnserve\n\nThen it is just a matter of changing the user's login shell to the rssh shell, e.g.\nsudo chsh -s /usr/bin/rssh steeldriver\n\nYou can then test that SCP works e.g.\n$ scp steeldriver@localhost:~/Pictures/somefile.png ./\nsteeldriver@localhost's password: \nsomefile.png                                                               100%   34KB  33.7KB/s   00:00    \n$\n\nbut SSH should fail with a rejection message like\n$ ssh steeldriver@localhost\nsteeldriver@localhost's password: \nWelcome to Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-88-generic x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\nLast login: Wed Jul  6 16:23:47 2016 from localhost\n\nThis account is restricted by rssh.\nAllowed commands: scp\n\nIf you believe this is in error, please contact your system administrator.\n\nConnection to localhost closed.\n\nNote that it does not appear to be necessary to add /usr/bin/rssh to the list of allowed login shells in /etc/shells\n", "Q: Can't find Apt-Cacher NG cache files after performing Ubuntu preseed installation using cacher as proxy I've setup Apt-Cacher NG in an Ubuntu host.

The downside of the mirror/http/proxy is that it affects ALL http downloads (wget/curl/etc) for the duration of the preseed.\nActually after further reading you should leave the country as literally country string manual. Manual doesn't mean 'replace me' in this instance, it means don't automatically pick a mirror (the default behavior) and this is actually why you weren't seeing any traffic on your apt-cacher-ng host, the system was simply bypassing it and going to the local regional mirror instead.\n", "Q: Shell Script source file not saved I saved a shell script in bin(created by me). When I run the program, to avoid ./ to run the script I need to copy the script to one of the directories specified by PATH variable. \nThe bin directory created is not in the path list. So, to add to the PATH list:\nexport PATH=~/bin:\"$PATH\"\n\nBut this directory is not getting saved to the PATH list. When I open a new terminal window I need to export it again to run the script. How can I add it to PATH list permanently?\nAlso if I try to move the script to the present PATH listed directory, it says PERMISSION DENIED. Do I have to move it by becoming a root user?\n\nA: You can add export PATH=~/bin:\"$PATH\" to your ~/.profile file. Add it to the bottom, save then reconnect to SSH.\nAlternatively, if you want this change to be system wide for any user, you can edit the path in /etc/environment.\n\nA: This one worked for me.\nOpen your .bashrc  gedit ~/.bashrc\nThe text editor is opened.\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nPaste this and edit the .bashrc.\nAfter closing the text editor, source ~/.bashrc\nIf you get Permission denied, it means the script is not in executable format.\n    chmod 755 program_name\nThis should do the work.\nOpen the new Terminal and it will work.\n\nA: Add custom home dir path to $PATH\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your ~/.profile\n\n*Add this line after all $PATH related vars:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/your-home-dir-path\"\n\n*Save file.\n\n*Log out / Restart.\nAdding this to your ~/.profile enable this change to terminal and text-mode.\nJust in case your custom path is ~/bin or ~/.local/bin !!!\nAs already said in question comment, these locations are already included in PATH in Ubuntu!\nYou can just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the directory (e.g., ~/bin).\n\n*Copy your script to it.\n\n*Change its permitions to be executable with the command:\nchmod +x ~/bin/script.sh\n\n*Logout / login. Alternatively, you can execute source ~/.profile\n\nA: As already mentioned, your ~/.profile should already contain something like the following:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nHowever, it sounds like you are launching an interactive non-login bash shell (i.e. you are not connecting over ssh but launching a terminal from a desktop environment) which does not read ~/.profile and instead ~/.bashrc is read as explained here. \nYou can modify ~/.bashrc to add the path or read ~/.profile for non-login shells as explained here but as Jacob mentioned if you logout/login this is not required.\nTo understand the difference between login and non-login shell see this answer.\n\nA: When you run\nexport PATH=~/bin:\"$PATH\"\n\nyou are setting the PATH environment variable and exporting it to the running parent terminals. It's like saying \"the new PATH variable is this, spread the word\". It works, but once you restart your computer the PATH will go back to the configured one. To make the change permanent, you will have to edit the .profile file on your home folder. It usually has this:\n    # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\n    if [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n        PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\n\nwhich would include the $HOME/bin folder automatically if it exists. But if it doesn't you can just add either the commands above, or:\n    export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"\n\nto the file and this folder will be included in the PATH on every session of your user.\nYou need root permissions to write in the /usr/bin directory, but that's not necessary if you change the .profile file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 New/old bluetooth headset problem with sound first sorry for my simple English.\nNow I try explain my problem: My bluetooth headset Philips SHB7150 not working (propably accu) and Philips service exchange it for new one.

I have a NON-UEFI laptop. However UBUNTU keeps detecting and wanting to install UEFI. Obviously the system never boots if I allow it to install in UEFI mode. Once a UEFI partition and installation has been created I can only boot from AMD64+MAC images, as standard images give me and \"error file '/boot/' not found\" and grub2 freezes and hangs up the machine. I can only reboot after that. I can however wipe the partition table and the LIVE USB installer will boot up just fine. What command line options can I give to tell it to install in BIOS BOOT mode and not UEFI?\n\nA: Step 1:\nRun the Ubuntu Installer. Select SOMETHING ELSE at the storage configuration prompt. Creating one main primary partition mounting '/' and a secondary partition as swap about the same size as your memory. The installation will fail at the end saying that GRUB-EFI-XX could not find an EFI partition. This is fine and normal.\nStep 2.\nKeep using the live environment you have running or boot from an Ubuntu AMD64+MAC LIVE-USB STICK. CHROOT the environment on the drive and try to install GRUB-PC. You will get an error that GRUB-EFI was not able to install and therefore it will resist the GRUB-PC installation.

It seems as though if one of these is set to a low value, turning the others up to max does not help. In our case, the alsamixer setting was muted, but none of the other device controllers noticed and we had no warning.\n", "Q: Why does redirecting sed output to same input file make my machine unresponsive? I was trying sed to replace some keywords in a large file (100 MB). I was unaware of the -i (inplace) option, so my first attempt was to redirect like this: \nsed 's/original/edited/g' file.log >> file.log\n\nwhat happened after that was that my PC went to a halt, almost no keyboard input. I tried a different console Ctrl + Alt + F1 but after slowly entering user name, it halted too. Without keyboard, my only option was to hardware-reset the machine. After logging in, I saw that file.log was about 8 GB. \nI really would like to understand why the execution of that command was able to make the system so unresponsive, and if mechanisms exist at the system level to trigger alerts and kill the offending process?  \n\nA: Your sed command was trying to read the file it was appending to. It will never reach End-Of-File, but will eat a lot of CPU time trying. That's why ^C (interrupt current process) was invented. \n\nA: Appending back to the file you read from is in no case a good idea, as you will end up with an ever growing file. If you really want to write back into the file you should use the -i flag:\nsed -i 's/original/edited/g' file.log\n\nor if you want it to create a backup before doing changes you can add a file suffix to the -i flag:\nsed -i.bak 's/original/edited/g' file.log\n\nThis would create a file called file.log.bak and then doing changes, what you did there by trying to append to the file you're reading from we call in programmer slang a data race, where different processes race for the same data source be it input or output. This is also why your machine came to a halt.\n\nA: As has already been said, >> appends to the file, so your sed command will sit there reading the lines it has just output, and then outputting them some more. If you wanted to replace your file in-place, > still wouldn't work, but you're aware of sed's -i option, which is definitely the one you want.\nIf, however, you're absolutely sure that you want to append to a file you're reading as a stream, and only want to do one pass of this, consider using sponge from the moreutils package;\nsed 's/original/edited/g' file.log | sponge >> file.log\n\nsponge reads from stdin into memory until EOF, then dumps all its contents to stdout, so sed will hit the end of the file, stop reading it, close it, and then sponge will start appending to it.\n", "Q: After installing Ubuntu 16.04LTS restart leads to Error: Grub Rescue screen Two days ago I got a Install/Live DVD of Ubuntu.

Inside this micro SD Card is the Raspbian OS of my Raspberry Pi and there's a lot of unused free space. I normally use Windows so I made a copy of my SDCard for back-up purposes using Win32diskimager. Then I tried to write this back-up into another 16 GB micro SD card but couldn't because the second one was a little bit smaller. So I decided I needed to slightly shrink my micro SD card partition (where there is a lot of free space) so that after saving it with Win32diskimager it could fit into the smaller 16 GB micro SD card.\nFor doing this I checked several solutions and found this excellent tutorial Easy Resize and Back-Up Raspberry Pi SD card with Ubuntu that I decided to follow. The only problem with the tutorial was that I have to use Ubuntu which I don't know anything about.\nNevertheless I installed WMware 12.0.0 and decided to run an Ubuntu virtual machine. The Ubuntu Image I could find was ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64 and I could also get a copy of the repository into an external hard drive (as my internet connection is extremely slow because I'm still using a dial up modem).

How is it ensured that a trusted user can't compile a package with malware and place it in the universe repo.\n\nA: NOTE: This is answered more in-depth by a member of Ubuntu Security Team in this answer. My answer below was written two years prior to the linked answer.\nCanonical has Ubuntu Security Team, which is a paid group, that  professionally reviews and supports software submitted to Ubuntu archives, as well as releasing fixes (aka the security updates) . \nFrom the Ubuntu Wiki:\n\nThe Ubuntu Security Team often performs audits on software before it\n  is to be officially supported. Once vulnerabilities are found, the\n  Security Team uses responsible disclosure to let others know about the\n  issue.\n\nThe Ubuntu Security Team doesn't work on the packages alone but does collaborate with others, in particular Debian security team, and vulnerability trackers such as MITRE CVE database , and maintains its own CVE Tracker. \nThe same wiki page also lists that they're actively involved in development of tools to protect form new vulnerabilities; among others , the tools are AppArmor, CompilerFlags, etc. \nIn particular, Security Team FAQ states:\n\nSoftware installation tools that come bundled with Ubuntu, such as the\n  Ubuntu Software Centre and Update Manager, validate packages when they\n  are installed to make sure they are secure and have not been\n  manipulated or trojaned during their download. Also, a large subset of\n  packages in the archive are officially supported by the Ubuntu\n  Security Team and get timely updates for security issues that may arise\n\nSo in other words put by thomasrutter , the packages are signed cryptographically to ensure their validation.\nThe specific repositories that Security team oversees are stated in the FAQ as well:\n\nAll binary packages in main and restricted are supported by the Ubuntu\n  Security team for the life of an Ubuntu release, while binary packages\n  in universe and multiverse are supported by the Ubuntu community.\n\nOf course, software nowadays runs in millions and millions of lines of code, in variety of languages, so as our esteemed moderator ThomasW.   noted properly , the security team are humans too, and they can't possibly keep track of everything.  So yes, some vulnerabilities and bugs can slip through , especially in universe and multiverse repositories , but there are people and mechanisms in place to ensure that those vulnerabilities and bugs don't run rampant .\n", "Q: I am trying to boot an old windows xp computer without any working hard drives from my Ubuntu USB I have a computer on which it's original hard drive failed.

I installed 2 Samsung 950 Pro SSD's and I have previously managed to get Ubuntu 16.04 installed and it dual booted fine.\nHowever, I upgraded the BIOS and that caused serious problems with (only) the Ubuntu installation. First it was a nouveau error and then it dropped me to a shell because it couldn't find the boot drive (I think) I figured that the sanest step was to re-format the SSD's and do a fresh reinstall of Ubuntu 16.04 from a USB.\nI have turned off Fast Boot and Secure Boot and have used the UEFI boot with Legacy Option ROM. I cannot recall exactly if Secure Boot was disabled during the initial installation of Ubuntu but I can say with certainty that, as of this moment, Ubuntu (and gparted) do not recognize my SSD drives without Secure Boot being deactivated. With Secure Boot acitvated, I am unable to install to, or even find the SSDs using 'sudo fdisk -l'. As I mentioned previously, I don't think this was the case during the first install (prior to the BIOS update) but I can't be certain. \nI am still booted from the USB in UEFI mode and installed in UEFI mode.

Here the specs: MSI 7693-040R 970 Gaming, AMD FX 8350, GTX 970 4G, 16 MB RAM, 500GB SSD. BIOS runs in UEFI mode.\nI've been searching around now for two weeks in order to solve my issues but to no avail. Here are the problems I'm facing: \n\n\n*\n\n*Very slow boot time (16.04 freezes shortly on purple screen)\n\n*unity-settings-deamon crashes every time after boot (Unity Settings Deamon crash in 16.04 every time after boot)\n\n*USB ports often seem to hang (I'm using a wireless-dongle for mouse and keyboard and they sometimes just freeze)\n\n*Not much of a problem, but might be something related: When I boot and come to the purple screen, my desktop image is shown only after a very long delay.\n\n\nMy questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I find out if I'am facing these problems due to bad hardware?\n\n*Is there a chance that wiping the machine and installing 14.04 will solve these problems?\n\n\nSince I could not find any solutions even after long hours of searching I am actually quite desperate by now and thinking about getting back to Win7.\n\nA: Allegedly, AMD support dropped off in 16.04 - and isn't due to return anytime soon. \nBut neither of my machines have anything AMD, and I still had other problems.\nI'd be willing to bet your problem is not due to your hardware - but live booting/reinstalling an older distro will certainly help you deduce that. \nThe first thing I would try, if I were you - is to install a newer kernel. \nTry 4.5 - upgrading the kernel fixed a few things for me. \nSecond, you may want to roll back to 14.04 - or in my honest opinion, 15.10 was solid, and will be my choice for rolling back, if it really comes down to it. \n", "Q: I can neither open nor uninstall Steam (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) My Steam have apparently become completely unfunctional: If I try to open it, the icon flashes for a few seconds and nothing happens afterwards. If I try to uninstall it (Ubuntu Icon >> Search for 'Steam' >> Right button >> Uninstall), there are also no results. \nI'm very new to Ubuntu and I've recently upgraded it to the last version expecting it was the right thing to do, but I don't know if it was really. Do any of you guys know how to fix this?\n\nEdit:\nThank you both for your replies.\nI've tried typing 'steam' on the terminal. A bunch of messages then appeared and it upgraded Steam (I think) and opened it. I closed everything and restarted the computer.

You should re-install and re-setup. About the Windows 10 partition, you can try TestDisk to try to recover the lost partition. There are some other commercial products also. If you can't recover, if you have the serial, you can download Windows 10 directly from Microsoft. (Sometimes your notebook have a sticker with the serial bellow).

The problem is that while I have TRIM support enabled at the encryption level in the system, I did not have it enabled in the live session.\nI was using cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 sda5_crypt prior to running lvconvert --merge as described in the question. Trim support is not enabled here, thus when BLKDISCARD runs after the snapshot is merged, it fails.\nThe solution is to use cryptsetup luksOpen --allow-discards /dev/sda5 sda5_crypt. This enables TRIM support at the encryption level. This can be verified with dmsetup table /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt --showkeys - the result should show \"allow_discards\" at the end.\nExecuting lvconvert --merge after this works fine:\nxubuntu@xubuntu:~$ sudo lvconvert --merge /dev/vg1/lvsnapshot14\nMerging of volume lvsnapshot14 started.\nlvroot: Merged: 95.6%\nlvroot: Merged: 100.0%\nMerge of snapshot into logical volume lvroot has finished.\nLogical volume \"lvsnapshot14\" successfully removed\nxubuntu@xubuntu:~$ \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 no devices shown in nautilus Since today all my devices stoped showing in nautilus sidebar.

You've probably spent more time googling the scarier looking things in dmesg than I have and discovered no one noticed anything. If you're still willing to persevere, here is something a little less haystack.\nHypothesis: If there is a hardware problem, it should manifest itself with the same set of kernel or libc API calls every time. i.e.:\n\n\n*\n\n*A bad disk or disk controller will constantly produce stack traces ending with  open(),access(), read(), write() etc. \n\n*Bad memory will usually fail on malloc()/free() (but this might get complicated).\n\n*Bad CPU will behave erratically\n\n*Bad video driver will produce some sort of unknown stack trace, but hopefully something interesting enough to get the attention of a kernel developer smarter than us\n\n*On the software side, mozilla chrome and thunderbird producing stack traces going through the same user land libraries indicates the but might be in that library.\n\n\nExperiment: Automatic collection of stack traces. The accepted answer does some gdb trickery. However, it seems the libsegfault, (or if you want to collect more information the apport one) will be the best \"show me the segfault\"\n", "Q: How to start byobu everytime I start a terminal when using zsh as default shell?

I tried toggling this option, but it doesn't change anything and I still have to run byobu whenever I start a terminal.\nIs there a way of forcing byobu to be launched whenevr I start a terminal?\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't use zsh but I had this problem with the standard terminal application on Ubuntu and Linux Mint (gnome-terminal). I believe that the 'byobu-config' command only enables byobu for remote log-in, for example through ssh. In my case byobu-config had added the following line at the end of ~/.profile to enable byobu for remote log-ins:\n_byobu_sourced=1 . /usr/bin/byobu-launch 2>/dev/null || true\n\nI added the same line to the end of ~/.bashrc and it then worked for the local terminal too.

I think this is possible through ACL but please feel free to let me know how can we achive this? using any method I am fine but I want this configuration.\nplease help.\n\nA: This is definitely possible. First, change /db-data's group to app-data:\nsudo chgrp -R app-data /db-data\n\nNow set up the permissions:\nsudo chmod -R g+rwx /db-data\nsudo chmod -R g-w /db-data/archived-data/*\nsudo find /db-data/archived-data -type d -exec 'chmod' 'g+rwx' '{}' ';'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo chmod -R g+rwx /db-data gives app-data full permissions to /db-data and everything inside it\n\n*sudo chmod -R g-w /db-data/archived-data/* removes app-data's write permissions for everything inside /db-data/archived-data\n\n*Finally, sudo find /db-data/archived-data -type d -exec 'chmod' 'g+rwx' '{}' ';' restores app-data's write permissions for every directory in /db-data/archived-data (but not the files inside those directories), which is necessary to let app-data create and delete any files or directories inside /db-data/archived-data.\n\n\nNow anyone in app-data will be able to read, execute, create, and delete files or directories in /db-data/archived-data (including sub-directories deeper than 1 level; i.e. app-data will be able to create and delete files in /db-data/archived-data/a/b/). If you don't want app-data to have read and/or execute permissions either, change the g-w in sudo chmod -R g-w /db-data/archived-data/* to g-rw for no read permissions, g-wx for no execute permissions, or g-rwx for no permissions at all (if you do this after running the find command, you will have to re-run it).\nFinally, note that if a user in app-data creates a file or directory, he/she will be able to modify the file/directory that he/she created (but existing files will still be unmodifiable).\n", "Q: Phone availability What's the deal with the phones? I didn't see the entire cycle but it seems like the Meizu Pro 5 was available for about 5 weeks. The others have never been available in that time. Is there a schedule? a plan? Thank you.\n\nA: The Pro 5 won't be available again. Some developers have had success flashing Ubuntu on Pro 5's which shipped with Android. However that process isn't straightforward, and doesn't support the Ubuntu project through device sales.\nOther devices are on the short term road-map, and should be available to buy soon. Unfortunately Canonical have little control over the availability of devices, that's down to the partner, in this case Meizu. I'd recommend contacting the manufacturer to let them know you're interested in Ubuntu devices :). \n", "Q: Screen goes blank after suspending and never wakes up. Fix? I have recently switched from Windows to Linux and have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed dual booted with Windows 10. Things were working fine until yesterday I found out if the computer is suspended (either by putting the lid down or due to inactivity), it never wakes up. \nI looked into other forums and found no exact solution to the problem. \nThis could have happened because I installed a lot of .deb files by mistake and now a lot of unmet dependencies are left. A log file as big as 37 GB was made which I had to compress to save space. \nI have tried deselecting the lock screen after suspension option and not suspending if screen turns off. It helps if the screen has been off for little time like 5-10 minutes. But in long term screen off situations, the screen never wakes up. \nHow do I fix this? \nP.S. I am new to the Linux world so this kind of basic problem is pretty problematic for me.\n\nA: You know, I had similar problem on a previous version of ubuntu.\nThat time I've heard that energy management applications were difficult to write, so they did not support suspending on all hardware.\nYou said you installed lots of broken deb files, you'll probably want to reinstall linux, its not difficult.\nBut as you were sure it was ok, probably the easyest thing for you to do is re-install ubuntu.\nOther quick-fix you could try is to disable ACPI on BIOS and put \"never suspend\" on energy settings.\nYou could file a bug if you knew you had a bug for it to get fixed on next ubuntu release, but this is unlikely your case.

Below is the output from parted\n\nI'm not sure why the drives are switching back and forth on that second 128MB partition. It's causing problems with using fstab to mount the drives.\n\nA: One way I found to solve this problem is to use the UUIDs, create a mount point for my USB drive and add a listing to the /etc/fstab file so the USB drive is mounted the same every time on boot up.  \nI have a Seagate 3TB External USB, so this is what I did:\nFirst, created a mount point for the Seagate drive: \nCreate one mount point for each partition you want to mount.\nsudo mkdir -p /media/Seagate_p1\n\nThen I obtained the UUID for the Seagate partition(s):\nNOTE: UUIDs do not change unless the partition gets re-created and / or reformatted.\nsudo blkid\n\nExample:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Seagate Backup Plus Drive\" UUID=\"6AAA4323AA42EB61\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nAdded UUID entry to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=6AAA4323AA42EB61 /media/Seagate_p1 ntfs default,nofail 0 0 \n\nNow, every time my system boots the Seagate drive is always mounted at the same mount point.

I also tried executing a chmod 777 / while in terminal but that didn't do much good either, or maybe I did something wrong there... I tried looking for an answer to this question online but all I can find is how to chmod specific files and directories within the system.\nThe system is encrypted and all I am able to do now is to decrypt the disk before the system starts to load, but after that I can't do much. If anybody could help me with this it would be much appreciated.\n-- Update -----\nOk, so this is where I am at right now:\nI used a USB with a live Ubuntu system on it by clicking on the Try Ubuntu option and then using the terminal to change permissions for / of my system with sudo chmod 777 -R for the hard disk where my Ubuntu OS is installed.

I just had to do a clean install and copy all my data back from my backup drive. This time I made sure I save the home decryption key on my external drive.\nI guess my advice would be to make sure you save your home decryption password and back up your data regularly.\n\nA: I think It's all there if you still have the encryption key.\nYou can try a live usb ubuntu image\nSee this post about mounting encrypted volumes.\n\nYour volume is probably encrypted with LUKS, here's how to mount it:\n\nYou need:\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup\n\nTo decrypt the volume:\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 my_encrypted_volume\n\nNow you can mount it as usual:\nsudo mkdir /media/my_device\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume /media/my_device\n\nTo lock the container again, it needs to be unmounted first:\nsudo umount /media/my_device\nsudo cryptsetup luksClose my_encrypted_volume\n\nTo automatically put it in the /media location, use the udisks tool\nsudo udisks --mount /dev/mapper/my_encrypted_volume\n\n", "Q: How to fix missing dropbox panel icon with a startup script?

The command most likely runs before its target is \"in the field\".\nChanging the command into:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && dropbox stop && env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=\"\" dropbox start -i\" \n\n...will probably do the job.\n\nA: This problem bugged me for a -long- time, but finally a fix that works for me with Xubuntu 16.04:\nThe normal menu launcher (which works fine) uses ~/.local/share/applications/dropbox.desktop\nwhich contains the line:\nExec=dbus-launch dropbox start -i\n\nThe startup launcher (which has the bug) uses ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop\nwhich contains the line:\nExec=dropbox start -i\n\nThe solution:\nUse the same command for session startup as the normal menu launcher.\nDead easy - but just one problem:\nWhen the dropbox app runs, it overwrites ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop with the command that fails, which it copies from /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop. So we need to fix this file rather than the one in ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal window, run the command:\nsudo mousepad /usr/share/applications/dropbox.desktop\n(if you don't use Mousepad, substitute the command for your preferred text editor)\n\n*Enter your password when prompted\n\n*Replace the line:\nExec=dropbox start -i\nwith:\n# Exec=dropbox start -i\nExec=dbus-launch dropbox start -i\n\n*Save the file and close Mousepad.\n\n*Ensure that Dropbox Preferences are set to start Dropbox on system startup.\n\n*Reboot to test.\n", "Q: Editor with caching like Notepad++ in windows Is there an editor for linux which can cache files in it? Every time I started the Notepad++ on windows, it brought all files which I've left open (even unsaved files).\nUnfortunately the Notepadqq doesn't brings up this function. Does anybody have a recommendation? \n\nA: Ubuntu have plenty of editor. Here are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Gedit with plugin (gedit-restore-tabs).\n\n*Atom is a very powerful editor with a tons of plugins, save-session or remember-session will does the trick.\n\nA: Notapadqq has caching as default. Is a pretty good alternative that does most of the things that Notepad++ does. Here is a the github repo.\n\nA: I would suggest Atom Editor \nhttps://atom.io/\nif anything is missing, most likely you can find additional packages that will do what you want!\n\nA: I'm not sure, but Geany (sudo apt-get install geany) restores previous files and tabs from last session.\nAlso you can install Notepad++ on wine if you like it.\n\nA: You can also try Visual Studio Code for Linux.

But if you really know, I won't argue, as I don't know. Just quoting some info: \n\"A multi-monitor bliss\nPlasma is bliss for those with multiple monitor setups. Plasma gives each monitor a personality of its own - which is quite limited on other DEs. You can give each monitor a different wallpaper (you can actually set different wallpapers for virtual desktops and activities as well.) Each monitor can have its own desktop layout and panels. The widgets on these panels and desktops can be configured differently which means, if you work with clients who are in different time zones, you can change the time of each desktop to that particular time-zone.\nNo other DE, in my knowledge, is capable of doing that.\" [https://www.linux.com/learn/how-use-kde-plasma-desktop-pro]\n", "Q: How can I iterate more quickly when creating a snap? I am working on a snap of a bigger piece of software and building the snap, removing the old one, installing the new one just takes a very long time.\nI would like to iterate over creating the snap and testing things out more quickly. I know that the snap builds just fine, now I'm interested in testing things like launching the app and its integration. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Preface\nOne way to go about this is to use snap try. From its --help message:\nThe try command installs an unpacked snap into the system for testing\npurposes. The unpacked snap content continues to be used even after \ninstallation, so non-metadata changes there go live instantly. Metadata\nchanges such as those performed in snap.yaml will require reinstallation \nto go live.\n\nIt also comes with an option:\n--devmode     Install in development mode and disable confinement\n\nThis is particularly helpful if you want to test confinement bits and getting the use of interfaces right.\nUsage\nThe way to use this is simple, just run:\nsnapcraft prime\nsnap try prime/\n\nIn the first step you tell snapcraft to do the \nFinal copy and preparation for the snap.\n\nAnd in the second step snapd makes use of the contents of the directory to \"install\" the snap. Now you can play around with the package while still being able to make changes to it.\nExample\nLet's use an example from the Snappy Playpen to show how to use this.\nWe are using consul as it's relatively quick to build and use:\n$ git clone https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen\n$ cd snappy-playpen/consul/\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ snapcraft prime\nPreparing to pull consul \n[...]\nStaging consul \nPriming consul \nsnappy-playpen/consul$ \n\nNow let's make sure that we don't have another version installed of it and then proceed with the installation.\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ which consul\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ snap try prime\n\nName    Version  Rev  Developer  Notes\nconsul  0.6.4    x1              try\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ consul --help\nusage: consul [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]\n\nAvailable commands are:\n    agent          Runs a Consul agent\n[...]\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ \n\nSo far so good. It seems to work just fine. Now let's replace it with /bin/echo just to see how things work:\nsnappy-playpen/consul$ cp /bin/echo prime/bin/consul \nsnappy-playpen/consul$ consul --help\nUsage: /snap/consul/x1/bin/consul [SHORT-OPTION]... [STRING]...\n   or:  /snap/consul/x1/bin/consul LONG-OPTION\nEcho the STRING(s) to standard output.\n[...]\ndaniel@daydream:/tmp/test/snappy-playpen/consul$  \n\nAs you can see, we can make changes to the live system in prime while still running things under confinement. This is generally a good way to get the snap up and running and fully tested quickly.\nNote: With snapd before 2.0.10 (2016-07-09), you had to temove the snap before running snapcraft clean or snapd would get into a bad state and whine about being unable to find mounted snaps. Some more fixes are lined up for 2.0.11, which should land in a few days as well.\n", "Q: Problems with DNS I am having issues with DNS.

Some providers or carriers want to save money and don't invest on overloaded DNS servers.

On upgrading to xenial, the package tzdata-java was removed and is indeed no longer available. I managed to install older JDK versions (still needed for some development) from the openjdk-r PPA, but tzdata-java isn't in there either. I have seen some unit tests fail because the timezone data isn't available.\nWhy was tzdata-java removed, and more importantly, how can I install some kind of reasonably up-to-date timezone information for Java?\n\nA: tzdata-java was removed because OpenJDK 8 does not provide the necessary files to build it. Quoting the Debian bug report which prompted its removal:\n\nThe problem is that the default java has recently been switched to openjdk-8, which doesn't provide javazic.jar. As such we can't build tzdata-java anymore.\n\nThe other answer gives a PPA which provides a Xenial tzdata-java package for OpenJDK 6 and 7.\n\nA: Java 6 and 7 timezone data were included via the tzdata-java package but this package isn't available for Ubuntu 16.04 so if your java version is 7 or 6 just run :\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:justinludwig/tzdata\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tzdata-java\n\nFor more details about this PPA ,this is it's launchpad link.\n", "Q: Why is the output of wall command not displaying in stdout?

Then, do-\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-7-5-local_7.5-18_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, got to synaptic packet manager, and search for cuda.

You might need to remove CUDA and start over, rm -rf /usr/local/cuda-<7.5 or 8.0> Make sure to replace the <> section with your actual version(s) and run it as sudo.

I am installing in R in ubuntu, but I am a bit confused with the many options there are to install packages.\nThe traditional way is to install them, inside R, by doing install.package().\nUbuntu however offers the possibility of installing with apt-get. This is interesting since the OS will keep packages updated.  Since they have only a couple of packages available it will create problems sooner or later. I will eventually have install packages through the traditional way, having them installed in different ways, and maybe (?) this will also create version problems.\nWhat is the preferred way to install and keep R packages in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I would usually install using apt-get r-cran whenever possible, as this takes care of dependencies and updates in a cleaner way. Only if it is not available I'll use install from within R. \nNote that there are two repositories for R Debian packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Official R: provides a few packages. To include it, you need to add the link to the repo updating your source.list file. This is documented on the CRAN-ubuntu page, then run apt-get update, then upgrade\n\n*PPA: Michael rutter provides a ppa, cran2deb4ubuntu, which contains many more packages. For some documentation, see the end of this blog. You just need to run (then after update/upgrade): \n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/c2d4u\n\n\nA: Please note that for R 3.5.0 the repo name has changed and Task Views libs precompiled by Michael Rutter are now available from cran2deb4ubuntu_3.5\n\nA: I think the only R packages available through the Ubuntu repos are the packages maintained by the R development core team. Like with most packages, those available through apt or synaptic are not always the newest versions. Luckily you have the option of adding a CRAN-maintained software source by creating a new file at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/CRAN.list that contains a single line of text:\ndeb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/\n\n(replace trusty/ with your distribution's codename; if you don't know it type lsb_release -c into a terminal).  After that (and an apt update) your package manager will always install (or update to) the CRAN-maintained versions of r-base, r-base-core, etc., because they will have higher version numbers than the ones in the debian sources.  See here if apt complains about the repo being unsigned.\nFor all other packages (AKA \"contributed packages\"), I prefer to install within R via install.packages(c(\"name_of_package\", \"name_of_other_package\")) whenever possible, unless I know for a fact that the version on CRAN is old and that a newer version has functionality that I need. In such cases you can install from GitHub with devtools::install_github('AccountName/RepositoryName') or download an archive and install it from a terminal window via R CMD INSTALL name_of_package.tar.gz, or within R via install.packages(\"/path/to/downloaded/package.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\").\nFor completeness, here is the official guidance from CRAN.\n\nA: UPDATE: cran2deb4ubuntu is now maintained by a team of folks. Use sudo add-apt-repository ppa:c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+ to install additional packages outside of CRAN\n", "Q: Cant access Windows Dual boot I can't access Windows 10 although at boot screen there is an option.

I boot to cdrom. Whether i type \"live\" or one of the other options (tab menu) or just hit ENTER, i get the same result. The black screen with white text runs; changes to a white screen with black text; then changes to a blank black screen. then it sits there forever. So it never installs at all. Before Ubuntu i tried both Debian 8.5 and the test version of Debian 8.5. Both install without an issue or error, but when i reboot after the install, i get a FAILED to start LOAD KERNEL MODULES error and the boot fails. And i did format\\reinstall 3 times. So i feel like i am out of ideas here. I wanted Ubuntu or Ubuntu Studio, but at this point just want a working Linux distro. \nHas anyone run into this before ? Have any suggestions ? Certainly appreciate any help. Thanks.\n\nA: i did get some suggestions about overwriting the mac os with linux , which made me think the issue was with the MBR on the primary hard drive. so i yanked out both hard drives and put two new drives in. installed debain 8.5 on the primary drive. rebooted. and got past the \"failed to start LOAD KERNEL MODULES\" error. got 3 screens further. actually saw the log in screen , but before i could type anything the screen went to black with a non-blinking cursor, then the screen broke up into a cool looking b/w pattern. so made progress but still no actual success.\n", "Q: Mount fstab cifs guest command not recognized During the last few days I've tried to connect to a Windows shared folder on another machine using Ubuntu.\nFinally yesterday I succeeded, but today it is not working anymore. \nHere's what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a directory on Desktop\n\n*add this line to /etc/fstab:\n//network_ip/shared_folder /home/user_name/Desktop/directory_on_Desktop cifs guest,uid=1000 0 0\n\nYesterday it worked fine, but today it says: mount (22): invalid argument\nIf I change, in the fstab file, from guest to users it works fine. But why can't I use guest? \nP.S. Yesterday after finishing using the PC I shut it down without manually unmounting the shared folder. While it was shutting down it stopped on the Ubuntu window (the one with five dots under the logo) so I held down the power button to shut it down.\n\nA: 1) perhaps, just a hunch, fstab program runs before network is up.\nThe correct approach should be editing /etc/network/if-up.d  for updating the fstab whenever the interface goes up (and if-down.d, when it goes down). (ask for help with this)\n2) Other thing: probably you had the guest user, if you want only the \"guest\" user to mount, ok, but you'll probably want any user to mount. you should put \"user\", for any user to have access.\n\nA: Stumbled upon the same behavior in Arch, mount.cifs version 6.7. Whenever the guest option was specified the mount command failed with the \"invalid agrument\" message, even though the man pages listed the guest option as supported.\nI worked around that by specifying username=guest,password= instead. That is, user \"guest\", empty password. Worked fine connecting to an anonymous share on a Windows XP laptop. I think you can use any name in this case, not just \"guest\". Maybe even an empty name will work.\n", "Q: Can't execute script in terminal I am a total n00b\nI am trying to install Ubuntu on my phone and I am stuck.

What should I do?\n\nA: Authenticate in the Software Center with the same user password that you use to login to Ubuntu. Or just press Enter if you haven't set a user password yet, but if you haven't got a user password you should set a strong user password to keep your operating system secure.\n", "Q: Mouse movement lags flash game this was not happening before in a game I play (Realm of the Mad God), which was flash version 11.2.202.621, but now is happening in 11.2.202.626, The game runs through shockwave (swf). \nIf needed I have footage of the problem.\nProblem still persists with flash 11.2.202.632\nEdit: using flash player projector debugger from adobe, just recently it stopped the lag, but only for the projector, projector set in 11.2.202.626.\nEdit: the problem does not seem to cause lag, but generally stop the game from running in general, data reception and distribution seem to stop when I move my mouse at a high rate.\nEdit: This issue might be caused by firefox's cash.\nUbuntu 16.04 was also happening in 14.04.\n\nA: The problem was solved after I changed the scan frequency of my mouse to 125hz, going through the mouse settings of my razer mouse I changed some of the settings and tested it by playing the game.  \n", "Q: what to do after installing \"ubuntu-restricted-extras\" to play MP3 and MP4 files?

Thanks for help in advance.\n\nA: You need to learn how to package your program (no matter whether it's a script or binary executable) in the .deb format.\nThen you can sign up to Launchpad and create a PPA (personal package archive) where you can upload the package. \nUsers may then add your PPA to their software sources (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:USERNAME/PPANAME && sudo apt-get update) and install it (sudo apt-get install abcd) afterwards. \nTo allow direct installation without having to add a PPA first, your package would have to be added to Canonical's official Ubuntu repositories, but that this is a rather long process which is probably not worth the effort in your case.\n\nUseful links:\nPackaging:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Packaging\n\n*http://packaging.ubuntu.com/\n\n*create a .deb Package from scripts or binaries\nCreating a PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\n\n*How do I create a PPA?\nOfficial repositories:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to get my software into Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Which drivers to install on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? I am new to Ubuntu. Can you please tell which drivers to install for basic and proper functioning of the system?\n\nA: You usually do not need any additional drivers, Ubuntu is able to handle most common devices out of the box. This is unless you experience any problems like a not properly working wireless network.\nIn some cases, you might want to replace the default open source drivers with the proprietary ones provided by the device manufacturer for better performance or support of special features though. This usually applies to graphics cards, mainly nVidia and AMD ones.\nYou check whether there are additional proprietary drivers available for your specific system by opening the System Settings and clicking on Software & Updates. Navigate to the Additional drivers tab. It takes a while to scan your device and will then offer you a list of devices for which you may chose one of multiple drivers.  \n\nA: Most of the time, there's no need to install additional drivers. The main three exceptions to this are:-\n\n\n*\n\n*GPU - nVidia and AMD have their own drivers providing accelerated 3D capabilities.\n\n*Wifi - Some Wireless chipset drivers aren't installed by default. \n\n*Printers - Many printer drivers will be auto detected and installed, but some require drivers from the manufacturer website.\n\n", "Q: Run in terminal not working I am new to Ubuntu and I was trying to run this script: \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho hello world\n\nIt works fine if I open the terminal first and manually invoke it. Like ./test.\nI have set \"Ask each time\" in file prefs:\n\nThis also works fine: \n\nNow I click Run in terminal. And Lo! Nothing happens.\nI expect it to open the terminal and echo hello world. What am I doing wrong? \nThis is a fresh installation of ubuntu along with windows from the ubuntu website. \n\nA: Your problem:\nThe problem is that echo hello world executes within milliseconds, faster than the terminal window is able to pop up.\nThis means your script already exits before the terminal is visible and therefore its startup is cancelled and you see nothing.\nSolution 1 - modify script and add a delay:\nYou can add a delay (here: 5 seconds) at the end of your script so that it runs longer and you have time to view the result before the script quits and the terminal window closes itself:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho hello world\nsleep 5\n\nSolution 2 - modify script and wait for a keypress:\nYou can also add a read command to the end of your script to wait for keyboard input before the script exits.\nThe -s parameter causes silent input i.e. your pressed key will not be echoed to the terminal.\n-n1 lets it read only one single character and returns immediately afterwards instead of waiting for Enter to be pressed.\nThe -p \"Press any key to exit...\" argument actually specifies the text to print before waiting for input.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho hello world\nread -s -n1 -p \"Press any key to exit...\"\n\nSolution 3 - change gnome-terminal's preference to keep the window open:\nLaunch a gnome-terminal window, open the Edit menu and select Profile preferences. Navigate to the Commands tab. You will see a drop-down menu labelled When command exits:\n\nPick Hold terminal open here and close the settings window.\nFrom now on when you double-click on a script and select to run it in a terminal, the window will no longer close itself but stay open and display a banner informing you about the script's exit status:\n\n\nWarning!\n  This setting also applies if you manually open a terminal window and try to close it by exiting Bash using the exit command or Ctrl+D - I find it pretty annoying that the terminal window does not close any more then as well.\n\n", "Q: mysql connection string I was hoping to get some clarification on how to connect to mysql databases with a web app. There are lots of great answers on specific connection problems, but I was hoping to get some clarification on host type.\nI have Ubuntu Server 16 with a LAMP stack.

When would someone use localhost in their mysql connection string, and when would you use a different host parameter?\n\nA: Connection string depends of software you use, but yes, if you are on same machine with webserver and database, you refer to it as localhost or 127.0.0.1 or by hostname too, if you wish.\n", "Q: how to drag a folders or files on an application?

Ubuntu 16.04 is already current with the latest Q1 2016 Intel Graphics stack and therefore no Graphics Installer is needed.     \nSupport is deprecated for Ubuntu 15.04 \"vivid\" and Fedora 22. Please consult your distribution's documentation for upgrade instructions to newer OS revisions.     \n\nThe latest installer that supports 14.04 is version 1.0.6\nBut I sincerely doubt that this is the right way to solve that problem with DirectX, because the latest graphic stack in 14.04 should already overcome the \"Intel® Graphics Stack Release 2014Q2 for Linux\" that is supported by that installer.\n", "Q: Will the Ubuntu installer delete my HP recovery drive?

Other letters, that do not accept a quote or accent on the character, such as t, simply won't print until I either manually press space after typing the quote, or press the t button twice\nIs there any way to get the Windows-like behavior on Ubuntu?\n\nA: There are two keysyms for grave, grave and dead_grave, by default dead_grave is set to the ` key. xmodmap can be used to change it, and should be in Ubuntu by default (with arch install xorg-xmodmap).\nTo change it from the default dead_grave to grave, run:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  49 = grave notsign grave notsign brokenbar notsign brokenbar notsign\"\n\nThe rest of the values are various modifiers, e.g. the second one is shift.\nIf you want this to be permanent, create ~/.Xmodmap, and then add just:\nkeycode  49 = grave notsign grave notsign brokenbar notsign brokenbar notsign\n\nIf there are any other dead keys you're having trouble with, run:\nxmodmap -pke | grep dead\n\nAnd it should give you a list of dead keys. Alternatively you could run:\nxmodmap -pke >> ~/.Xmodmap\n\nYou will then have a full list of keyboard keys and their sym values in .Xmodmap, which makes it easy to change your dead keys and any other keys to whatever custom layout you like.\n\nA: Yes, I have a programmed solution.  The answer is in the Compose file under /usr/share/X11/locale/iso8859-1/ and /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/\nThat's where all the definitions of the dead keys are.  Put in a series of lines like this:\n<dead_acute> <S> : \"'S\"  # APOSTROPHE then LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S\ninstead of the entry in en_US.UTF-8/Compose, which is:\n<dead_acute> <S> : \"Ś\" U015A # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH ACUTE\nAlso create lines for every other letter, cap and small, for the ones that by default aren't defined at all, and will therefore do nothing:\n<dead_acute> <b> : \"'b\"  # APOSTROPHE then LATIN SMALL LETTER b\nPut all these changes into a file named .XCompose, dot ex compose, note the caps, in your home dir.  If you copy the whole file and only edit in these lines, taking the old ones out, you don't need to include the mother file, but if you only put your changes into your .XCompose, you will need to put an include line at the top of the file, referencing the system file your lines of code will replace lines from.  The way the syntax works is each line supercedes the previous line with the same code before the colon, and redefines that string to your new one, and all after the hash # is ignored as a comment.  Here's your chance to make it whatever you want.  As a testing thing, I set <dead_acute> <1> to \"XCompose 1.0\", just so I could immediately see if my code was being called at all in my .XCompose file.\nThat should give you the MS-Win international US keyboard behaviour you want, so you can type in \" 'Best wishes,' he didn't say. \", only having to hit the space bar once extra after the close-single-quote after the comma, because you've mapped \"'B\" to \"'B\" and \"'t\" to \"'t\", not to something unexpected that only a linguist would use.\nAlso, you might have to change your keyboard handler to \"xim\" instead of the default for your installation of Linux.  There's an article on how to do that.\n\"xim\" uses the Compose/.XCompose files.\nNow if only I knew how to turn off the smart quotes, which are driving me batty.\n", "Q: 16.04 - lightdm - run command every login attempt and every account unlock I need to make a picture with webcam at every login attempt. So i wrote a bash script, placed it in the /usr/local/bin/photo.sh\nBut here is the question - I don't know how to run this script at every login attempt (every wrong or correct entered password, every log in and every account unlock). Any suggestions?\nUbuntu 16.04, Unity, lightdm.\n\nA: tl;dr:\nIt works, but some package could overwrite your config and then you're screwed.\n\nI've made some progress here. I know how to run something at *every* authentication attempt.\nMy /etc/pam.d/common-auth:\n#\n# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services\n#\n# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,\n# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define\n# the central authentication scheme for use on the system\n# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the\n# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.\n#\n# As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.\n# To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any\n# local modules either before or after the default block, and use\n# pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See\n# pam-auth-update(8) for details.\n\n# here are the per-package modules (the \"Primary\" block)\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok_secure\n# here's the fallback if no module succeeds\nauth    optional            pam_exec.so quiet /usr/local/bin/onlogin.sh fail\nauth    requisite           pam_deny.so\n# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;\n# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code\n# since the modules above will each just jump around\nauth    optional            pam_exec.so quiet /usr/local/bin/onlogin.sh ok\nauth    required            pam_permit.so\n# and here are more per-package modules (the \"Additional\" block)\nauth    optional    pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\n# end of pam-auth-update config\n\nSo, let's start from the top:\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok_secure\n\nDefault, success equals 1 here. It tells PAM how many lines it should skip if user has authenticated successfully.\nI've changed it to 2, because i've added the line:\nauth    optional            pam_exec.so quiet /usr/local/bin/onlogin.sh fail\n\nSo, auth tells PAM to run command at every authentication, of course. Then optional should pass script even if there was an error i guess.\npam_exec.so is a library which runs the /usr/local/bin/onlogin.sh script with fail as a parameter, because this line is executed when user entered wrong credentials. I've added quiet, because on my VM there was an error at every sudo/su authentication.\nThe next line, ending with pam_deny.so, like the name says, prevents user from access. It's default here.\nThen, the same line as above, but ending with an ok, to tell the script that the user authenticated successfully.\n    auth    optional            pam_exec.so quiet /usr/local/bin/onlogin.sh ok\n\nAll was running correctly, but… The problem was when I've tried to login to the Ubuntu's built-in Guest account. Because, uhm, there is no authentication. No password = no authentication. In this case the solution provided by @NGRhodes works.\nAt my Ubuntu xenial VM everything worked correctly, so I moved it to my physical machine, rebooted the machine, logged into my account, logged back to guest. Good. Reboot again - works like a charm.\nSo, at the evening, like everyday I've updated my machine. Reboot. Log in. Password incorrect. Tried again - password incorrect… Booting some livecd distro, cd into /etc/pam.d/ to turn this off and what I see? success=2 became success=1 and every attempt - successfully or failed - executed pam_deny.so. \nBooted again, logged in successfully, tailf /var/log/apt/history.log | grep -i pam, and some wild libpam-cgfs appears.

I would like to disable root access on all TTYs except TTY1. I know this can be done by editing /etc/securetty, and commenting out all devices except TTY1, but I am unsure about the Local X displays. Should I comment those out as well? what about the UART serial ports, Serial Mux devices, Chase serial card, Cyclades serial cards, etc, etc. \nThere are so many devices so I am unsure as to how to deal with securing this file. Can you lead me in the correct direction as to what devices I should disable for a working system but root can only log in from TTY1?\n\nA: I think you're spending your effort on trifles. If Bad Guy can attach a terminal, Bad Guy can boot from his USB.\nBut, since man securetty says securetty - file which lists terminals from which root can log in it implies that you could comment out all but TTY1. Commenting out (or not) lines for hardware you don't have makes no difference.  \nSince, if you mess with /etc/securetty, you can end up locked out of your system, you must test carefully. If you have batch or at set up and running you could do by setting up a root batch job to do::\ncp /etc/securetty /etc/securetty.original\ncp /tmp/modified.securetty /etc/securetty\nsleep 20m\ncp /etc/securetty.original /etc/securetty\n\nAnd do your testing in the next 20 minutes, after which, the original (working) /etc/securetty is restored. \n", "Q: How to move entire Back In Time backup set to new hard drive? I have backintime storing backups to a hard drive. I'm replacing that hard drive and wish to copy everything from the old drive to the new one. How can I do that, preferably with rsync?\nI have 600GB data in total and both drives are 2TB capacity, so space should not be an issue. My first attempt was to run rsync -rt --progress /SOURCE /DESTINATION but this filled the 2TB drive and failed. I thought soft/hard links might be the problem so I next tried rsync -a --progress /SOURCE /DESTINATION but this failed the same way.\nThere is a similar question here about moving the metadata and settings to a new computer, but I'm trying to move my backup sets to a new drive within the same computer. The only change I want is the physical swap of the hard drives (and I'm okay editingfstab, etc, once I have a successful copy).\nIs rsync the right way to do this, with some argument I've overlooked, or do I need to use something like dd to copy? I am reluctant to keep trying because each attempt takes many hours to run before failing.\n\nA: You need to add rsync -H to preserve hard-links.\nrsync -avhH --progress /SOURCE /DESTINATION\n\nAlternative you could use tar to copy the snapshots because tar will preserve hard-links as well\ncd /DESTINATION; tar cf - /SOURCE/* | tar xf -\n\n", "Q: State of AMD drivers in 16.04 I am really confused about the state of AMD drivers on 16.04\nMy question is six-fold.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between\n\n\n*\n\n*The amdgpu driver,\n\n*The radeon driver, and\n\n*The amdgpu-pro driver?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*When would each of those drivers be used?\n\n*Are they all open-source?\n\n*Can you switch between them?\n\n*Which GPUs are supported?\n\n*Is AMD working on an fglrx replacement for 16.04?\n\nAs I do not have an AMD card, I am unable to experiment.\nI understand this is a broad question, but I want this to be a canonical question :)\n\nA: Here's what I've been able to find so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*A: The amdgpu driver, pre-installed in 16.04, is used for AMD's newest graphics cards. 3\n\n*B: The radeon driver, also pre-installed in 16.041, is a replacement for the fglrx driver1, and is used for older AMD cards that amdgpu doesn't support.\n\n*C: amdgpu-pro is not its own driver, but rather an overlay on top of amdgpu2. It is optimized for gaming2.\n\n\n*I think Ubuntu decides automatically. Although the amdgpu-pro driver has to be downloaded manually.\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*The amdgpu driver is completely open-source\n\n*The radeon driver is completely open-source\n\n*The amdgpu-pro driver is partially open-source\n\n\n*I have no idea.

They are now showing in ls as blue text w/ a green background.\nI was under the impression that this meant the sticky bit was removed from all of the directories, however chmod +t and chmod 1777 have not resolved them back to their default blue text w/ black background.\nCan anyone point me in the right direction on how to resolve this? \nThanks!\n\nA: This is perfectly normal on drives formatted with NTFS, since NTFS does not support Unix-style permissions (and as such, trying to change the permissions of a file or directory on that drive will do nothing), and Ubuntu, by default, sets the permissions of NTFS mountpoints to 777. However, you can set the permissions manually at mount time with the umask option:\nsudo umount /dev/your_usb_stick\nsudo mount -o umask=002 /dev/your_usb_stick /path/to/mountpoint\n\nNote that the value for umask is actually the inverse of the permissions you want; this will set the permissions to 775.\nAlso, with default LS_COLORS at least, a green background for directories isn't changed by setting the sticky bit; the only way you can get rid of it is to make the directory not be other-writable.\nBottom line: If your drive is formatted with NTFS, try mounting it with the option umask=002. If it's formatted with ext2/3/4, try running chmod o-w on the directories that are green.\n", "Q: Wireshark does not show any interface to capture packets I've installed Wireshark in Ubuntu 16.04 with the command:\nsudo apt-get install wireshark\n\nAfter program start, Start Capture and Stop Capture buttons are disabled.

When I use video call from viber or facebook (through chrome) my webcam feeds an inverted image. I am wondering how to fix it. Because two separate applications (Viber and Chrome) have this I am thinking it is not application specific.\nWhile looking for a fix in the internet I have found many cases giving instructions on how to fix this for skype. I have run\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:libv4l/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nwhich installed libv4l-0 libv4lconvert0 and retested but no fix.\nI have not followed further those solutions (e.g. here ) because viber and chrome are not 32-bit applications. I did check that viber is indeed 64-bit with the method provided here. \nI am including the lines of the files that I expect I should change if I were to do something similar to the skype fix:\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/viber.desktop | grep Exec\nExec=/opt/viber/Viber\n\nand\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop | grep Exec\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable\nExec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --incognito\n\nI am not sure how to modify those lines and where to find libv4l package for 64-bit, in order to implement a workaround that will make viber and chrome work properly.\nIn my quest to fix the underlying problem I started by looking for camera/video settings in Unity's \"Search Your Computer\" System Settings. But I found nothing. I also run:\n$ ls /dev/video*\n/dev/video1\n\nbut I don't know what to make out of that result. Also after running \nsudo lshw -sanitize\n\nI get, somewhere along a huge output:\n*-usb:0\n                  description: Video\n                  product: USB2.0 UVC 2M WebCam\n                  vendor: USB2.0 UVC 2M WebCam\n                  physical id: 2\n                  bus info: usb@1:1.2\n                  version: 2.02\n                  serial: [REMOVED]\n                  capabilities: usb-2.00\n                  configuration: driver=uvcvideo maxpower=500mA speed=480Mbit/s\n\nI tried to find the driver from this but found nothing.

Information from this answer also helped.\nThe main difference here is that applications are 64-bit, so I could not fully follow previous solutions. After installing libv4l I needed to find an appropriate path for a 64-bit version compat file to set the LD_PRELOAD variable. After looking around I found out I could do this with:\n $ dpkg -L libv4l-0 | grep compat\n /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so\n\nThis and Veazer's answer helped me complete the workaround by changing viber.desktop file. Important, before making changes make a backup, for example:\nsudo cp /usr/share/applications/viber.desktop /usr/share/applications/viber.desktop-original\n\nAfter that we have all the information we need to change the viber.desktop file. We only need to change one line. The following changes fix the problem in viber:\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/viber.desktop | grep Exec\nExec=sh -c 'export LIBV4LCONTROL_FLAGS=2 && LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /opt/viber/Viber'\n\nNote the integer value 2 for camera inversion.\nI expect the same approach to also fix chrome but I ll work on it later. Unless somebody can help me fix the underlying problem with the webcam drivers.\n\nA: Regarding fixing inverted/flipped laptop webcam video in Chrome/Chromium based browsers - a few days ago I updated ASUS P52F laptop to Linux Mint 18 XFCE that is on par with Ubuntu 16.04.1 now. I faced \"upside down\" webcam WebRTC video on hangouts and facebook using Chrome web browser only. Firefox works fine. Cheese also displays video properly. \nAfter some googling I found this bug report. In the comment 22 you can see that 2 years ago there was a 0001-Use-libv4l2-for-Linux-V4L-grabber.patch proposed that fixes Chrome/Chromium behavior. For more then a year now libv4l2 is added to Chromium, but is not enabled for Linux. You can see the whole discussion in the bug report thread. Long story short it looks like they are not actively working on fixing this for almost a year now. However, there is some ugly workaround...\nYou can add Flip this extension to Chrome. It allows you to flip your webcam video or any other element of a webpage. It will flip it only locally, so people who you talk to via Chrome also need to use the same trick. It's not pretty, but it's working... well, kind of ; ) After all switching to Firefox maybe a better and more comfortable solution.

I use 16.04 LTS. \n\nA: You Dont Need To Be Notified.\n I have Dell laptop and I keep it plugged in all the time and I dont bother about the 100 %. Because the hardware has built-in safety against over charge. Furthermore upon wanderinig through internet, and through personal experience I've discovered that for long healthy battery life:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you unplug after a full charge let it dfrain upto atleast 60% before plugging it again. That also applies for battery level more than 60%.\n\n*let it drain to critical level atleast once in six months before plugging in.\n\n*A healthy battery gives Average of 2-7 hrs.\n\n*Average laptop battery life is 4 years max(that is alot).\n", "Q: Mouse & Touchpad buttons change function after suspend/hibernate I have a Lenovo Ideapad Y560 Laptop running Ubuntu 16.04.

I can still open the tty, however none of the solutions posted online have actually worked. (Most of them weren't even accepted by the OP too.)\nSupposedly what I am supposed to do is install bumblebee, which installs fine without breaking ubuntu, but according to other threads here the proprietary nvidia drivers are needed to use cuda.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: Probably you forgot first before installation of nvidia-packages to export some variables to the library of CUDA.\nOn desktop in terminal one first needs to do:\n\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin\n\nand on 32-bit-machines this:\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia-current:/usr/lib32/nvidia- current\n\nbut on 64-bit-machines this:\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64\n\nThe rest is explained here in a contribution of me, but this concerns a different package of nvidia, but in the end anyway you need above all to export as described above... :\nHow can I Install Nvidia Driver GT 520 and Cuda 5.0 in Ubuntu13.04?\n\nA: My issue was that I was a,) not blacklisting nouveau correctly (probably not rebooting after blacklisting. I should read the docs better.)\nIn addition, the main culprit was that I did not set --no-opengl-libs. Since my machine has a switchable graphics card, having the runfile install them is apparently screwy. IDK why though.\n\nA: For machines with Optimus switchable graphics, the command line argument to use when installing the driver is \"--no-opengl-files\" (not \"--no-opengl-libs\"). e.g.:\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.78.run --no-opengl-files\n\n", "Q: SSH Into Server - Network Error: Connection Timed Out A friend of mine recent installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu Server minimum install with SSH Sever. My friend can connect to the Linux box via SSH from his windows box, on his local network.\nMe and another friend (B) (outside friend A's local network) however are not able to connect to the server via the internet. The router is set to use a DMZ for the Linux box so nothing is restricted by the router.\nWe are trying to use PuTTY to SSH into the server. We both have accounts on the server with SSH acces, but we are not even getting a login prompt.\n\nA: I don't mean to insult  you by telling you the obvious. I seem to do that a lot.\nI suspect you are not using the correct IP to talk to the SSH server from your computer. Remember, inside the router area, the server will have an IP number that is meaningful only inside the router's subnet, usually 192.168.xxx.xxx.  That works fine for everybody within the router, such as friend A.\nNow, from outside the router, you probably need to log in differently on the server.  Server has different address if you look at it from outside the router. Right now,  my computer is given dynamic ip at 192.168.0.105, for example, but my IP seen by rest of world is the IP assigned to my router by the cable company.\nHere's what I'd do if I were you.  Go to the server and use it to log in on the website \"whatismyip.com\".  That will tell you what IP  number your system seems to be on.  However, you will probably find that every other computer in that subnet appears to be at same outward facing IP.  Hence, you cannot \"get into\" your server using that IP. \nUsually, you have to configure the router so that messages on a port (SSH usually 22) will go to one of the computers inside the network.\nYou say it is set up as DMZ, which I remember from days of playing computer games, but it does not tell us much about how your computer is getting through to the server. In particular, the router has to pass through the messages to the server.\nThink it over, let us know what you find out. \n", "Q: When I try to install any package through the command line, I get an error.

For example you can use the raw ifconfig output:\n$ ifconfig eth0\neth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet 192.168.0.4  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255\n        inet6 fe80::ca60:ff:fe06:ac5b  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\n        ether c8:60:00:06:ac:5b  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n        RX packets 622902  bytes 792538068 (755.8 MiB)\n        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0\n        TX packets 392538  bytes 37764707 (36.0 MiB)\n        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0\n\nAnd then carve away this output until you see the information you are after:\n$ ifconfig eth0 | grep -w inet | cut -d ' ' -f 10\n192.168.0.4\n\nMy own choice of weapons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use grep with the -w option to search for only whole word matches. This way we do not catch inet6 as well.\n\n*Use cut with a delimiter  (-d) of a space and then select the appropriate field (-f) number to get the information we are after.\n\n\nThere are many, many tools to do this and doubtless a better way to accomplish this particular job. But this example shows the use of pipes and several of the tools that you can use.\n\nA: To add to andrew.46s answer here is how you can do it with awk and sed.

Anyone who can figure out how to apply it and build using it could have a patched mycroft running on a debian/ubuntu desktop.\nHaving yet to figure it out myself, still remain hopeful of seeing a good native ubuntu package fully patched and with working skills. Mostly the python issues could be potentially handled or resolved by a seperate tool for debian/ubuntu systems to process and correct various projects porting them to work, perhaps part of the autoconf tools or something similar.\nIn trying to manually install and build mycroft on my desktop the installation will and has become corrupted and even fails to properly work at times, requiring a full wipe and reinstall of it, including the various skills and config folders. Not something simple and easy for everyone, perhaps ubuntu has spoiled many of us in recent years. Feels like this should however have more created for testing and using it on ubuntu systems.\nStill when it works and the skills that are compatible so far seem to work well enough, it is a rather impressive project worth further investments, of time, money and such.\n", "Q: Update Ubuntu 14.04 to 15.10 - black screen I have just bought a Dell \"Inspiron 15 3552U\" with Ubuntu 14.04 pre-installed.

On my machine (Ubuntu 16.04) there is some key group containing only the two values \"scrollback-unlimited\" and \"use-theme-transparency\".\nThe keys \"foreground-color\", \"background-color\" and \"palette\" were missing from the default profile.\nThe terminal plugin assumes incorrectly that all required keys are present if you create a new profile from gnome-terminal. To enforce complete key creation you need to switch back and forth between different palette settings and I also had to create two profiles and switch \"Edit/Preferences/Profiles/Profile used when launching a new Terminal\" back and forth as well (this ensures that the key org.gnome.terminal.legacy.profiles/default is set).\nHowever, I think that settings under \"org.gnome.gedit.plugins.terminal\" should have precedence over the system settings concerning the terminal plugin in gedit. The user may want one color scheme for the system terminal and a different one for the terminal plugin.\nSo finally I changed the python script function get_profile_settings back to how it was in previous Ubuntu versions (just added the comment #) and got the desired result.\ndef get_profile_settings(self):\n#        profiles = self.settings_try_new(\"org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList\")\n#        if profiles:\n#            default_path = \"/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:\" + profiles.get_string(\"default\") + \"/\"\n#            settings = Gio.Settings.new_with_path(\"org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile\",\n#                                                  default_path)\n#        else:\n        settings = Gio.Settings.new(\"org.gnome.gedit.plugins.terminal\")\n\n        return settings\n\n", "Q: cant able to install openjdk-7-jdk and openjdk-7-jre When I run \nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nI am getting this error \n$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nReading package lists...

Like the second answer to this question, but in XFCE instead of Unity. \nIn case not, is there a keyboard shortcut for minimizing the active window? \n\nA: You may find all window manager shortcuts in System Settings → Window manager → Keyboard\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower window: Shift+Alt+PgDn To lower the window.\nIt works fine with composite on, when it is off it seen to send it back on same monitor only (few windows, not back all windows)\n\n*Hide window: Alt+F9 To minimize active window. \n\n*Switch application: This seems to me having same effect of sending window to the back. Setup a shortcut and try it.\n\nA: Minimize the active window\nAssuming you have xdotool installed (run sudo apt-get install xdotool if not), the command to minimize the active window is:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowminimize\n\nSimply add that to a shortcut key and it should work. On XFCE: open Settings > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts, add the command:\nxdotool getactivewindow windowminimize\n\nSend a window to back?\nTo send a window to the last position from cli is a lot trickyer: currently, there is no (cli) tool to find out the z-order of the windows. Theoretically, you could raise all windows, except the active one, but this will most likely mess up the order of the windows. \nunless\n...you use this one, but if minimizing will do, I'd stick with the solution above.\n", "Q: Fixed IP address reset everyday on Ubuntu Server 12.04 I successfully managed to setup a fixed IP address on my server running Ubuntu Server 12.04 by editing /etc/network/interfaces :\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.110\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nThen I ran the following command:\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0\n\nAnd my fixed IP address 192.168.1.110 is properly applied when I check via ifconfig\nHowever, everyday at the same time, the address is being reset, and everytime the same address is assigned which is 192.168.1.134.\nIf I run the sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 command again, my fixed IP address is back.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*what could cause the IP address to be reset every day at the same time ?\n\n*how can I fix that ? If possible, I'd like to avoid having to setup a daily script that runs the command.\n\n\nA: Speculative answer: You probably have a DHCP server on your network, that periodically hands out \"leases\" on the addresses in its pool. Your static address ending in 110 is in that pool, but it hasn't been handed out by the DHCP so it takes it back, and gives you 134 in return. \nTry a different IP address as far away from the DHCP pool as possible, which would be as low as 2 or as high as 252 (some conventions dictate that gateways have high numbers, although yours is 1).\n\nA: Check the gateway settings. On the gateway -router you will need to assign the same static ip address based on your server MAC address.\n\nA: Login to your router by typing your router ip into the address, usually 192.168.1.254 or 192.168.1.1\nLook for something like DHCP server settings and turn the DHCP server off then see if it makes any difference.\n", "Q: MultiPointTouchArea working on Ubuntu 15.04?

So, I created it and started the server, and it all worked well. As soon as I shutdown and restart the server, for some reason the /var/run/postgresql directory disappears. This causes the startup of postgres to crash with an error:\nFATAL:  could not create lock file \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock\": No such file or directory\nHelp appreciated!\n\nA: Solution 1 (By managing temporary directory /run/postgresql, /var/run/postgresql)\n\nDirectory /run/postgresql is a temporary directory. Path\n/var/run/postgresql is usually a symbolic link to /run/postgresql.\nsystemd-tmpfiles is mechanism to manage such temporary files and directories. systemd-tmpfiles creates temporary directories during\nboot and sets their owner, group and permissions.  It may read configuration files in three different locations. Files in\n/etc/tmpfiles.d override files with the same name in\n/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d and /run/tmpfiles.d.\n\nWe can create directory /run/postgresql on the fly at boot time using systemd-tmpfiles mechanism by creating postgresql configuration file as below\necho \"d /run/postgresql 0755 postgres postgres -\" > /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/postgresql.conf\n\nSolution 2 (By relocating PostgreSQL lock file location)\n\nAnother way to fix the issue is to relocate the PostgreSQL lock file\nlocation. We can do so by using below query\n\nALTER SYSTEM SET unix_socket_directories='<any-existing-path-with-valid-permissions>, /tmp';\n\nHere we can provide any path for PostgreSQL lock file which is already present on the system and have required permissions to manage lock files by postgres user.\n", "Q: Compiz using excessive amounts of RAM?

When using the trackpad (\"Elan touchpad\" identified by xinput), I use my right hand for maneuvering the mouse pointer, and my left for performing left-clicks in the bottom left of the touchpad.  Unfortunately, often the mouse jumps towards the bottom left of the screen just before my click is completed.  Initially I thought the jump was entirely to the bottom left, but subsequently I have discovered the jump is only in that direction (by adjusting the speed of the mouse pointer).\nI have tried various settings in the Mouse and touchpad settings, and also fiddling with various settings in synclient (e.g. FingerHigh), to no avail.  \nGenerally, I remove my right hand from the touchpad before clicking with the left hand; however, sometimes perhaps the interval between the release and the click is too small, or nonexistent.

That should help the kernel recognize a quick tap as a left click and (I hope) differentiate between that and a trajectory sensed as continuous on the pad, going from right hand to left hand according to the sequence above.\nExperiment various avenues at length or possibly change the way you work with yr touch-pad.\n1) Coasting:\nFirst read the doc and  make sure that \"conventional coasting\" is disabled. If you want coasting, make sure it is enabled as \"edge coasting\" only. Otherwise the type of sequence described above will lead to what I call \"pointer movement leak\" (\"conventional coasting\"), a behavior that consist in the fact that the pointer continues its rectilinear movement even after you have stopped driving it on the pad. Conventional coasting stops with a tap.\n\"Edge-coasting\" on the other hand is only activated when you apply finger pressure on a pad-edge. It stops immediately as finger pressure goes below a given value.\n2) Second, tweak Synaptics Tap Durations (273): 180, 100, 100:\nThe 3  values are:\n   Option \"MaxTapTime\" \"integer\"\n          Single touch timeout or maximum time (in milliseconds) for detecting a tap.\n\n   Option \"MaxDoubleTapTime\" \"integer\"\n          Maximum time (in milliseconds) for detecting a double  tap.\n\n   Option \"ClickTime\" \"integer\"\n          Duration  of  the  mouse  click  generated  by tapping.\n\nTry lowering the value of MaxTapTime (touch and release time) from 180 to, say, 90. It will make yr pad more sensitive to taps, hopefully helping the kernel discriminate between a quick tap and a change of finger during pointer movement. That will certainly have side effects, which you can gauge by referring to this.\nIf this does not give you satisfactory results, try to:\n3) Turn off Synaptics Pressure Motion (294): 30, 160:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synaptics Pressure Motion: 32 bit, 2 values, min, max.\n\n\nAll the tools and documentation you need are referenced and demonstrated in this answer as well as in a previous one already cited by you.\nNOTE: I am not sure anybody can help you anymore than that, as the solution is very much dependent on trial and error and yr personal taste. For that reason this type of question does not elicit that much interest. This is understandably important to you, but I am afraid that getting into such particulars and specifics may fall outside the scope of general interest. \n\nA: I had this problem with a Synaptics touchpad and what resolved it for me was to change the noise cancellation values.

When I'm using the nouveau driver everything is working fine, but of course I'm missing the CUDA support of MATLAB.

If I do that will the information stored in the folders on the second physical drive be encrypted by virtue of being mounted under the home directory? If not, can I run Ecryptfs on the new partitions so that the encryption works the same as for the home partition (i.e., decrypts at login, etc)?  Also, is the best way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?\n\nA: If you're setting up new partitions on the new drive, you'd might as well use encrypted partitions with cryptsetup / LUKS. \neCryptfs and EncFS are for encrypting some folders on a filesystem, LUKS is for encrypting an entire partition. See  archwiki for a good overview of different disk encryption systems.\nWith the new partition(s) encrypted, then you can use any type of link or just a shortcut to the new encrypted partitions, and any data anywhere on the new partitions will be encrypted. You could even have the new partitions automatically mounted when you login (storing the keys in your encrytped home) or mounted at boot, or on-demand.\nDon't worry about mixing linked encrypted files and only relying on eCryptfs to carry the encryption to a different drive (which probably won't be encrypted if you only link the decrypted folders anyway) it just sounds like a data leak waiting to happen.\n", "Q: How can I correct punctuation when I am typing?

Pulseaudio (or similar) is required to have multiple applications at multiple different volume levels, as ALSA is simply the hardware driver layer, and does not itself provide any software mixing at the application level.\nTo use ALSA directly for all applications, you would need to create a virtual loopback sound card for each application, which is not trivial, and would make dealing with volume control significantly more complex and frustrating. I don't know that any of the volume slider widgets for system trays of any environment support such a configuration.\n", "Q: Moved a directory to an unknown .../ place (three dots) I came across this weird situation when I accidentally moved one of my directory to an unknown place I am unable to find.\nWhat I did was executed this command -\n/opt/lampp/htdocs/cake$ mv cakephp/ .../\n\nIt did executed without any error, and now I am not able to locate my directory.\nI googled this issue but I am not getting any help.\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: You renamed the directory cakephp in /opt/lampp/htdocs/cake to ....

I then booted to the Xubuntu DVD and could go up to the language selection and 'accessibility' menu of the DVD. However, afterwards (I tried multiple times), I then get either an 'emergency shutdown' or a kernel panic (according to the terminal-like text I have on the screen). I also tried enabling acpi=off as I had trouble installing Lubuntu on a laptop with a Celeron M from 2006 and it solved the problem (which seemed different though as it clearly indicated a sleep-wake issue) on this laptop.\nQuestion is: do you have any how I could successfully install Xubuntu 16.04 on this machine? Once, I know this an old laptop, it ram Windows 10 honorably and I'd love to be able to install Xubuntu on this machine despite its age.\nThanks\n\nA: Maybe I have to use forcepae!

I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and \nctags --version reports\nExuberant Ctags 5.9~svn20110310, Copyright (C) 1996-2009 Darren Hiebert\n\nA: It is simple, as in the universal-ctags docs:\ngit clone https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.git\ncd ctags\n./autogen.sh \n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu, and for me I can use either:\nsudo apt install universal-ctags\n\nor\nsudo snap install universal-ctags\n\nThe snap has the advantage that it will work on any Ubuntu release (or on any other distribution with snapd installed.)\nI manage this snap package, and currently (June 2022) make releases from the universal-ctags source every two weeks. So the snap is a lot more up-to-date (May 2022) than the apt (currently September 2021, on Jammy).\nThe snap has some disadvantages imposed by the snap security model (snaps run in a container, and are only granted access to specific aspects of the underlying host), so for example the snap of universal-tags cannot run on source code that is outside of your home folder. These limitations are described in detail on the snap listing page, but shouldn't be intrusive for the vast majority of normal use.\nI've been happily using the snap version professionally for over two years now.\n", "Q: Why can't I see the new group that I belong to when opening a new terminal?

How can I extract page number 3 to 10 from all pdfs? \nTo extract the pages from one pdf, I am using the following command.\npdftk *.pdf cat 3-10 output 3-10.pdf\n\n\nA: This one liner (split into 2 lines for ease of reading) was tested and works well on my system:\nfind . -name '*.pdf' -type f -exec bash -c \\\n'pdftk \"$0\" cat 3-10 output \"${0%.pdf}_3-10.pdf\"' {} \\;\n\nSimply open a Terminal window in the base folder (the one that contains all of the sub-folders) and copy and paste the entire one line command given above. It will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Traverse all of the sub-folders and identify all the pdfs\n\n*Extract pages 3-10 from each (using your example command)\n\n*Give a sensible output filename: the original name with _3-10 added\n\n\nAnd this should neatly and economically accomplish your purpose...\nVariation:\nOptionally you could give a different output location to collect all of the altered pdf documents. For example you could create a folder called ~/extracted and alter the commandline above to the following:\nfind . -name '*.pdf' -type f -exec bash -c \\\n'pdftk \"$0\" cat 3-10 output \"~/extracted/${0%.pdf}_3-10.pdf\"' {} \\;\n\nAnd thus all of the altered pdf files would appear in ~/extracted.\nEndless possibilities :).\n\nA: You can use qpdf as pdftk is not available on ubuntu bionic by default any more:\n\nfind . -name '*.pdf' -type f -exec bash -c 'qpdf --empty --pages \"$0\" 3-10 -- \"temp/${0%.pdf}_1.pdf\"' {} \\;\nThis will put the new pdf's into temp folder.\n", "Q: DNS settings messed up and resolvconf uninstalled Yesterday I messed up my network settings on Lubuntu 16.04. Wifi had problems and I thought it was my problem, it turned out later, that the problem was a temporary problem with the central wifi, it basically showed as connected but I could not load any pages in Firefox.\nTrying to fix it I am afraid i screwed up my DNS and networking settings :(\nI followed the advice of doing:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge resolvconf && sudo apt-get install resolvconf \n\nSo I removed resolvconf but then of course I could not re-install it because internet was not working :(\nI can \"ping 8.8.8.8\" but I can't reach google.com as I get:\nping: unknown host google.com\n\nThis, as far as I understood means a DNS problem.\nI think resolvconf is necessary for fixing my problem, I tried editing the config file adding \nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.8.4\n\nBut It does not work :(\nOn my laptop fortunately I also have Windows 10 on a small partition, I used it to download the .deb file of resolvconf from http://packages.ubuntu.com/ but it gives me a MIMEtype error and does not let me install it.\nI tried downloading the tar.gz but when I extract it I can't do\n./config (or configure)\n\nbecause I get:\ndebconf: DbDriver \"passwords\" warning: could not open /var/cache/debconf/passwords.dat: Permission denied\nTemplate parse error near `# These templates have been reviewed by the debian-l10n-english', in stanza #1 of ./templates\n\nHow do I reinstall resolvconf and how do I fix the \"ping: unknown host google.com\" internet problem? I tried to look online and on askubuntu but no luck so far :(\nI am desperate as I am on holiday and I really need Lubuntu connected to the network, Windows 10 is damn slow and I don't like it :(\nIf anyone can help it would be great! Thank you in advance.\nEdit: trying to run \"cat /etc/resolv.conf\" and  \"cat /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\" gives me\n\nno such file or directory\n\nBut if i check with Pacman in /etc/ I can find a \"resolv.conf\" file (which I opened and it is empty) and a \"resolv.config\" (which contains nameserver 8.8.8.8 and nameserver 8.8.4.4, which are Google DNS)\n\nA: Problem: In my case I accidentally removed the resolvconf file. So my computer is connected to the internet, but it has no idea what a DNS server is and so it has no way of translating readable URLs into IP addresses. Hence you can do ping 8.8.8.8 and it will respond, but ping google.com fails.\nSo the solution is basically to reinstall resolvconf. You can download the package from the Ubunut archive: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/resolvconf\nOne neat hack around this is to go to another computer, or your phone, or whatever and find out the address of archive.ubuntu.com - just ping it and copy the IP address. You could also use a WHOIS service I guess.\nThen go back to the Ubuntu system and open /etc/hosts and add:\nx.x.x.x archive.ubuntu.com\nwhere x.x.x.x is the IP address you found out via ping on another machine. So now your computer should know about archive.ubuntu.com. You can then open the page in a browser and navigate to the resolvconf package. Of course putting in that IP address would also work and you should probably avoid leaving it in your hosts file in case it changes later.\nDownload the most recent package, and then run sudo dpkg -i resolvconf_1.79ubuntu8_all.deb or whatever the deb file you downloaded was. I suggest manually running dpkg even if your browser prompts you to install it, it didn't work that way for me.\nPresto: you now have resolveconf again and it should work more or less instantly.\n\nA: This is what worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04; reinstalling resolvconf.\n\n\n*\n\n*find your repo online, for example: http://de.archive.ubuntu.com.\n\n*get the ip of it since you can't resolve addresses. Write it down.\n\n*Log back into Ubuntu. \n\n*Use wget to download the resolvconf deb package and reinstall it. This will only solve the domain resolution.\n\n\nexample using IP of http://de.archive.ubuntu.com\nwget 141.30.13.20/ubuntu/pool/main/r/resolvconf/resolvconf_1.78ubuntu2_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i resolvconf_1.78ubuntu2_all.deb\n\n\nA: One idea: find out which DNS names are required to be resolved by apt when you want to install resolvconf again. Then, manually add entries to /etc/hosts for those DNS names. Find the actual IP addresses while you are booted into windows or so. For example, for the Singapore mirrors:\n$ nslookup sg.archive.ubuntu.com\nServer:     192.168.0.1\nAddress:    192.168.0.1#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   sg.archive.ubuntu.com\nAddress: 91.189.88.162\nName:   sg.archive.ubuntu.com\nAddress: 91.189.88.149\nName:   sg.archive.ubuntu.com\nAddress: 91.189.88.152\nName:   sg.archive.ubuntu.com\nAddress: 91.189.88.161\n\nThen the /etc/hosts would be:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n91.189.88.162       sg.archive.ubuntu.com\n\nYou need to replace the hostname with your actual archive server (listed in /etc/apt/sources.list)\nI didn't try this (as I don't want to mess up my DNS resolution), but it could work.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 16.04 Where is apps store? and How do I install packages?

I remember that last thing I did in Terminix it was setting own command (echo) with option immediately closing terminal. Since then, Terminix always starts and ends at the same time.\nWhat can I do in this situation? I started uninstall.sh script from GitHub's Terminix site but after reinstall it is exactly the same situation.\nCommand whereis terminix shows me that Terminix is in /usr/bin/terminix and in /usr/share/terminix but remove these locations by rm -rf nothing changes. I have Ubuntu 16.\n\nA: Re-installing the program doesn't affect the program settings stored in the user profile.\nSince Terminix' settings are configured through GSettings, you can reset the responsible configuration option com.gexperts.Terminix.use-custom-command either through the dconf-editor GUI or the gsettings terminal command:\ngsettings reset com.gexperts.Terminix use-custom-command\n\n(I don't have Terminix installed but I read its GSettings schema definition.)\n\nA: Presumably, you added the echo command using some kind of GUI menu offered by this Terminix program. The simplest way to remove that is to rename its configuration directory. I don't have Terminix installed, so I can't be sure, but it should be either:\n~/.config/terminix\n\nor\n~/.terminix\n\nSo, just run\nmv ~/config/terminix ~/config/terminix.old\nmv ~/.terminix ~/.terminix.old\n\nOne of the two should work and will rename your existing Terminix configuration directory. All your settings will be lost but you should now be able to open it again. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 screen stays black or purple when you start lo que pasa es que hace un tiempo instalé Ubuntu 14.04 en inicio dual con Windows 8.1 en mi pc (Hp Pavilion AMD A8) y corría normal pero hace un momento necesita usar wine pero me di cuenta que no había instalado bien, entonces abrí synaptic y decía que tenía ficheros rotos, entonces le di desinstalar y dijo que debía desintalar unos ficheros, actualizar otros e instalar otros más, y comenzó.

If I take a C#.NET + WinForms project and try to compile under Ubuntu 14, will it not work under these circumstances? I've hear about .NET under Linux but I don't know how far it has been done or is mono still the only way?\nI'd really, really like to avoid rewrite the entire application in C++ and Qt.\n\nA: The new .Net on Linux you may have heard about is called .Net Core. It should be well supported, but it is a subset of .Net Framework, targeted primarily at web and cloud applications, and does not support WinForms (or any other UI library).\nSo, if you want to run a WinForms application on Linux, Mono is still your best option. Using that may work for you or it may not. Miguel de Icaza said in 2014 (and I assume nothing has changed since then):\n\nMono has an implementaiton of Windows.Forms, but it is both old,\n  unmaintainted and known to have some bugs.\nSome people have been able to use it effectively, but we do not currently\n  have an active maintainer, so we encourage developers to pick something\n  like Gtk# instead.\n\n", "Q: Unity Wifi GUI - Connects ok, but doesn't display any other networks Ubuntu 16.04 on a Lenovo Ideapad Y560.

The touchpad is very sensitive to placing finger on the touchpad. So that moving the mouse pointer is mostly received as (1) tap (2) move, rather than just move. So it mostly select-drags rather than just move the mouse pointer.\nFor the scrolling with double finger gesture the two fingers touches the touchpad is received as double click instead most of the time. If I do the gesture really quick I might be able to scroll, otherwise it is so unreliable to scroll a page and mostly ends up double clicking.\nScrolling a page itself is slow and short, so I have to scroll many times to move a page down/up.\nI do not have this problem in Xubuntu 14.10.

This has the bonus of not changing vlc global settings, so settings specified in this manner are not saved. Settings for this are (seen in cvlc -h):\n\n\n*\n\n*-1 (The default, this selects best available video quality)\n\n*1080 (This selects Full HD: 1080p)\n\n*720 (This selects HD: 720p)\n\n*576 (This selects Standard Definition: 576 or 480 lines)\n\n*360 (This selects Low Definition: 360 lines)\n\n*240 (This selects Very Low Definition: 240 lines)\n\n\nSo for your clip the following works nicely:\ncvlc --preferred-resolution 240 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Oo4kBHBNU \n\n\n*Altering input video globally using the GUI:\nYou can also alter the input video settings globally from the GUI preferences as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nThese settings are saved for subsequent vlc usage and will be saved in your vlc configuration file: ~/.config/vlc/vlcrc. As an example: this is added for a preferred resolution of 240:\n# Preferred video resolution (integer)\npreferred-resolution=240\n\nYou have to love vlc :)\n", "Q: How can I reset the system from a guest account?

Regular icons are unaffected, as their size is by default 48px.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu Tweak Tools.\nNavigate to Tweaks tab.\nTweaks > System/File Manager > Thumbnail icon size > 128 or 150 (default is 64)\n", "Q: Unable to update software centre from terminal Unable to update software centre via terminal and update software via centre is very slow and not able to download software from centre.\nPlease help.  \nvineshnair@vineshnair-Lenovo-G580:~$ sudo apt-get install gnome-software packagekit\n[sudo] password for vineshnair: \nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\n\nA: From the message shown to you, it seems you have another tool running with elevated privileges.

Laptop model is Dell Latitude E7440 and it has 500 GB SSD. I have McAfee drive encryption installed which asks for authentication pre boot. I freed up 30 GB space from my drive and tried to install Ubuntu in it. The Ubuntu installer takes all the input and drive size etc. But after everything when you click the last Next button it starts its operation, like creating partition, copying files etc. In this section I could see the create partition operation lasts for barely 1 sec, but all other installation everything happens and it shows installation done, restart now. But after restarting my PC can't boot to Ubuntu as there is no partition available. I checked in Windows Disk management, there also the space which I unallocated for Ubuntu shows as free space instead of the partitions. What could be wrong here? Does the McAfee drive encryption affect? Or the problem is because of SSD ? Please help. Thanks\n\nA: I have resolved the issue. It looks like if you have McAfee drive encryption installed the partitions do not get created. \n", "Q: Why did removing 'python3' remove many other important packages?

direct dependency to the python3 package (listed in the Depends, according to ben query '.depends ~ \"python3\"' Packages_amd64 | grep -E 'Depends: .* python3 ' | wc -l), and given Canonical plans to make python 3 the default, it wouldn't be surprise that there are a bunch of packages that depends on it. That's why python3 package is important, but notice how it doesn't cripple your system... you can actually recover from it if you install the meta-package that pulled all the window/desktop manager packages, namely ubuntu-desktop.\nNow, why did apt decides to remove other packages because you removed python3? Because apt has a dependency resolver that makes sure that after every operation no packages has unsatisfied dependencies, and when it can't find a solution that doesn't leave a \"broken\" dependency, it refuses to remove it. APT did warn you about all the packages being removed which were listed in \"The following packages will be REMOVED\" list. You accepted it and then it proceeded to remove them.\n\nA: @StarOS' answer (now removed) was correct in that by removing python3, you also removed a lot of critical dependencies needed by your system, and a great many other packages.\nHowever, he/she was not correct in recommending you to use Boot-Repair. Instead simply go to the terminal with:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install -f (the -f- option is also written --fix-broken which is more explicit), just in case your system was broken in some way.  (Go to man apt-get for more info). \n\n*followed by sudo apt-get install python3\nAs suggested by @DavidFoerster in a comment below:\n $ sudo apt-get install -f ubuntu-minimal ubuntu-desktop\n\nwill actually rebuild your desktop, re-install your missing packages, among them python3. This will completely fix your install.\n", "Q: Difference between installing git vs installing git-all What's the difference between\nsudo apt-get install git-all\n\nvs\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nIs there any advantage of installing either or all?\n\nA: Git-all contains all sub-packages, whilst Git only includes main components with minimal dependencies. \nAs stated in Git on Debian Packages, Git does for example not include \n\ngraphical user interface and revision tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web interface..\n\nThose are additional packages.\nIf you look at Git-all on Debian Packages, you see it states \n\nall sub-packages\n\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 17.10 x64 git-all v2.14.1 depends on:\n\n\n*\n\n*git (actually git, 28.7 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-doc (git documentation, 10.8 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-cvs (git-cvs interoperability, 1.1 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-mediawiki (MediaWiki remote helper, 0.8 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-svn (git-svn interoperability, 1.0 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-email (git email add-on, 0.8 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-gui (git GUI, 2.2 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*gitk (git revision tree visualizer, 1.5 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*gitweb (git web interface, 0.8 MiB without dependencies)\n\n*git-el (git emacs support, in my case 113 MiB with all dependencies)\n\n\nIn my case git-all installed 93 packages totalling 215 MiB with all dependencies.\nSo, it's up to you which packages to install..\nP.S. You can get all this information, for example, from Synaptic Package Manager.\n\nA: I believe running sudo apt-get install git-all is roughly equivalent to running sudo apt-get --install-suggests install git. The latter caused problems for me on Ubuntu 15.10. Among other packages, it tried to install git-daemon-run, which didn't work. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runit/+bug/1448164) \nInstalling git-daemon-sysvinit first, then git, worked better for me. git-daemon-sysvinit replaces git-daemon-run.\nSo, to finish my thought, you can install either git-all or just git, depending on your requirements. But git-all has the caveat that you will need to install another package first. (git-daemon-sysvinit)\n", "Q: Workspaces missing in ubuntu 16.04. No appearance preference in settings. Recently installed ubuntu 16.04, and could not find a way to enable workspaces. There is no option called appearance in my settings\n\nA: Hi i figured out what to do in this case.\nI did a \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nand it came back. But while doing this some of the unwanted softwares that in uninstalled earlier also came back (like thunderbird, libreoffice math etc)\n\nA: This did the trick for me:\nsudo apt install unity-control-center\nFor some reason i had previously installed gnome-control-center\nThey look almost identical, but the \"Appearance\" icon is missing.\n", "Q: Transfer multiple files at the same time? Just trying to figure out a faster way to move files across my network between backup drives etc. \nSomething similar to when you use filezilla ftp and you can seit it up to move multiple files at the same time. Every other option i've used like cp, scp, rsync etc seem to send and receive one file at a time.\n\nA: If all you want to do is transfer the contents of a folder with cp, just use cp -r\nTransmitting in parallel offers no speed increase.\n\nLet's say your LAN is 100Mb/sec. That would be ~12MB/sec.\nLet's say you want to transfer two files:\n\n*\n\n*File file1 is 24MB.\n\n*File file2 is 48MB\n\n\nLet's compare transferring them in serial vs parallel.\nFirst, serial:\nAt a rate of 12MB/sec, 24MB transfers in 2 seconds.\nAnd 48MB transfers in 4 seconds.\n2+4 = 6 --> total transfer time is 6 seconds (plus overhead).\n\nNow parallel:\nSince you are transferring two files simultaneously, each file transfer will receive half of your full LAN bandwidth.\n12MB/sec ÷ 2 = 6MB/sec.\nSo each file will be transferred at 6MB/sec.\nfile1 24MB ÷ 6 = 4.\nfile1 takes 4 seconds to transfer.\nWhen file1 finishes, 24MB of the 48MB file2 has already been transferred.\nThe remainder of file2 to be transferred is 24MB.\nBut now that the first transfer is done, the full bandwidth of 12MB/sec can be regained.\n24 ÷ 12 = 2.\nSo the remainder of file2 takes an extra 2 seconds to finish after file1 finished.\n4+2 = 6. --> total transfer time is 6 seconds (plus overhead).\n\n6 = 6.\nTherefore, they will take the same amount of time to transfer.\n", "Q: From where `date` retrieve date? In a new notebook, I configured Ubuntu to automatically sync time.  Timezone is set to UTC +8.  There is no problem with date when the notebook is connected to Internet.\nBut when I started the notebook in air gap (offline) mode, I noticed date time displayed by Ubuntu is incorrect.  I can confirm that both date and date -u returned incorrect date.  No TZ set in terminal. The date in UEFI menu is still the correct one.  I believe that date is not using date from notebook clock.  How date resolve date in this case?\nI tried to set time in UEFI menu to 07/09/2016 21:04:xx and executed the following commands:\n$ date\nAhd Jul 10 05:04:25 MYT 2016\n$ date -u\nSab Jul  9 21:04:26 UTC 2016\n$ sudo hwclock\nAhad 10 Jul 2016 05:04:35  MYT  .057058 seconds\n$ sudo hwclock --localtime\nSabtu 09 Jul 2016 09:04:39  MYT  .813741 seconds\n\nThe date I set in UEFI now become the result for date -u while it should be the result for date.  Is this has something to do with EUFI time service?\n\nA: As you already mentioned, there are two different clocks:\n\n\n*\n\n*The software clock is set and used by the linux kernel and provides the time for all programs\n\n*The hardware clock (real time clock (RTC)) has battery backup power (i.e. is always running) and is used to adjust the system clock on boot\n\n\nUEFI has no access to the system clock and thus uses the RTC. date uses the system clock. The reason why it is properly working when there is an internet connection might be a running ntp service which adjust the time on startup?\nYou might want to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata for a text based option to set your system time properly. If Ubuntu will still display your last login date (really?) after reboot, there seems to be an issue with the RTC based system clock initialization on startup. \nSource: man rtc\n\nA: Looks like Ubuntu (since version 15?) assumes that RTC is in UTC by default.  Here is the result of timedatectl command:\n$ timedatectl\n      Local time: Ahd 2016-07-10 16:07:28 MYT\n  Universal time: Ahd 2016-07-10 08:07:28 UTC\n        RTC time: Ahd 2016-07-10 08:07:28\n       Time zone: Asia/Kuala_Lumpur (MYT, +0800)\n Network time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: no\n RTC in local TZ: no\n\nI'll need to make sure the rest of OSes installed in the system to treat RTC in UTC.\n", "Q: How to avoid password request for sudo for crontab scripts? I need that a new user could execute sudo without any request of password, because this user has in crontab a .sh that uses sudo for some commands.\nI created a new user on my ubuntu server 16.04 x64\nadduser my-user sudo\ngpasswd -a my-user sudo\n\nThen using visuo i added this line, based on this question\nmy-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD : ALL\n\nThen rebooted\nAfter reboot I logged in using my-user and tried to do sudo clear, but it ask me the sudo password. \nNOTE: I've added the crontab using crontab -e my-user so I suppose my script is executed as my-user. In fact, the crontabbed script crashes telling me in the log about a sudo request of password. I really need to execute the script in this way to be able to create file with my-suer as owner.\nPlease tell me if some steps/lines were not needed and how to make able my-user to execute sudo without password request.\nThanks\nPS: I seen this question, but I'm not able to make it working so I need a more precise explanation, because my situation is different: i'm running a crontab script and I need it do not ask for sudo password\n\nA: Sometimes running a process from root's crontab may cause issues with initial file ownership and rwx mode; those may not be correctly preserved. \nIn any case:\n1) to create a new user, keep it simple:\n $ sudo deluser my-user  # if \"my-user\" is a regular user\n $ adduser my-user\n $ sudo gpasswd -a my-user sudo\n\n2) to include a new entry with a NOPASSWD tag in sudoers or in a file (e.g. /etc/sudoers.d/60_my-user_rules), make the colon stick to the tag, i.e. NOPASSWD:\nI've not seen it before with interspersed space and yr rule becomes:\n my-user my-host = NOPASSWD: /full/path/to/cmd [parameter1 [| parameter2 [| ...]]]\n\nAdding (ALL) before the NOPASSWD: is optional as the rule defaults to (ALL:ALL) anyway. You may however want to not only run your cmd/script with root privilege but also run it as either a given user (spec-user) or as a member of a given group (spec-group) or both. In that case, the rule becomes:\n my-user my-host = ([spec-user][:spec-group]) NOPASSWD: /full/path/to/cmd [parameter1 [| parameter2 [| ...]]]\n\nThis will actually restrict yr passwordless sudo disposition to one user, one host and one command. You can harden this rule by specifying the optional parameter(s) to that command. In that case the rule will apply only for that/those exact parameter(s).\nFor scripts, you could further harden this rule by ensuring that the rule applies only if the script was not modified in any way. This is a way to avoid script-hijacking. This is done through cmd-aliasing and specifying SHA-sums in /etc/sudoers.d/60_my-user_rules. \nHTH. Please report if you experience issues with that answer.\n", "Q: USB wired mouse stops working after some time, lsusb hangs, the /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb folder doesn't open up I'm having this problem for a long time.\nwhen I'm playing a game or working or after some time my mouse stops working! the cursor doesn't move and the left/right clicks won't work. unplugging and replugging doesn't work. only a reboot will.\nafter the mouse stops working, lsusb hangs and doesn't respond with any information.before the mouse stops working lsusb is fine.\nalso the related /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb* folder won't open by nautilus.\nI don't have any power-management packages installed. and after the mouse stops working, no other mouse or usb port for any device works until I reboot the OS. I've gone over all of the topics related to my mouse in the whole net! so please don't mark it as duplicate! thanks!\n\nA: You may want to try using the script described by Eli Billauer. The script worked for me up until recently. I am using a USB mouse and keyboard, with a desktop computer (no trackpad).\nI made a small modification (included ehci-pci interface in addition to xhci), so I'm going to post the exact script that I'm using here so you can compare with what Eli does. Note that you must run this script as root (sudo it):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor xhci in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci-pci ; do\n\n    if ! cd $xhci ; then\n        echo Weird error.

I have the same problem as you, Amir: my USB mouse fails sporadically. I will be right in the middle of moving the mouse around and kablam, the mouse turns off, and stops responding (the light on the mouse goes off). Sometimes this happens days after rebooting the system, sometimes hours.\nFWIW, lsusb simply hangs. In response to ignis' comment above, strace -f lsusb > out.log 2>&1 also hangs so I can't provide any info from that.\nOne more comment: this is not a case where the OS stops responding entirely. It's just the mouse. I can still use the keyboard, and I can also log in from another system and try things once the mouse stops.\n", "Q: HP Envy DV6 Quiet and only sees 15.6G of ram First time installed Ubuntu today, I am very happy with it so far.\nAs the title suggests it only sees 15.6G of ram instead of 16..

The other guests would then have the second bridge (LAN) connected to them so they can get their own IP-address with DHCP from the pfSense-guest.\nThe problem is, I don't seem to get and external IP address on the pfSense-guest. I've set-up pfSense to obtain it's WAN-IP with DHCPv4. My ISP allows me to have multiple IPv4-addresses, so that's not the problem. I've tested with other Ubuntu-guests and they are able to obtain a external IPv4-address from the same bridged-interface.

That network switch in turn is connected to the router (192.168.2.254).\nThis setup works perfectly fine in normal conditions and I can connect to the webserver from the two local computers without a problem. Now, I was testing if the two clients could still reach the webserver if the router was to go offline by unplugging the network cable running from the network switch to the router, (to simulate the router crashing/being reset or internet access to the outside being unavailable).\nHere is where the problem arises, every request made from the client computer to the webserver is now delayed by an even 10 seconds (even static html pages).\nIf I remove the gateway entry from the /etc/network/interfaces file (on the server) and reload the network interface without a gateway everything is fine again. So, it looks like the server is trying to reach the gateway for 10 seconds and then decides it can also reach the client pc directly. The clients and the server are on the same subnet and have the same netmask 255.255.255.0, by the way.\nI've also tried bypassing the switch by directly connecting one of the clients with the server, the same problem persists, it works, but with a 10 second delay. Pinging from the client to the server and from the server to the client goes without a hitch (less than 1 ms).\nroute -n outputs the following with the gateway set:\nDestination   Gateway        Genmask       Flags  Metric   Ref    Use  Iface\n0.0.0.0       192.168.2.254  0.0.0.0       UG     0        0      0    em1\n192.168.2.0   0.0.0.0        255.255.255.0 U      0        0      0    em1\n\nI've spend a good 12 hours trying to setup static routes, mess with network-manager and changing the metric and what not, but to no avail. At the moment I've even completely removed network-manager to rule out possible conflicting routes and configurations.\nAll I want is for the clients to be able to reach the webserver with the same speed regardless of the gateway being there or not. Not setting the gateway at all fixes everything locally but then I can obviously not access the server remotely anymore.\nHopefully my problem and setup is clear, I'm REALLY looking forward to getting this fixed and hope it's something obvious.\nEDIT:\nThe loopback interface on the server seems unaffected by the way, the website loads just as quick on the server itself with a valid gateway as without one.\n\nA: I FINALLY managed to get things working as they should(!).\nI added the two client ip addresses to the /etc/hosts file (of the Ubuntu server) as follows:\n192.168.2.228       192.168.2.228\n192.168.2.229       192.168.2.229\n\nThis completely solves the 10 second delay of the network interface trying to resolve the ip address with the router, and instead connect to the client directly (as it should).\nAlthough this solves the problem I think there is still an issue somewhere, as it should really prefer to connect to local computers directly instead of trying to resolve the 'dns' with the router, somehow (right?). I'm by no means a networking or ubuntu expert (I'm more of the web developer kind), so perhaps someone could clarify what the real issue is here (and perhaps provide a better solution?).\n", "Q: Change the number of workspaces with keyboard I tend to \"mistype\" a lot when, for instance, in emacs or such.

From what I understand, you would like to run your software without opening a terminal each and every time. It is possible to do this through the use of what are called \".desktop files\", which allow us to launch a program by clicking their icon (aka \"launcher\") in your application menu (aka the \"Dash\" in Ubuntu). According to This official guide, you can easily create a launcher using a program called gnome-panel. Please follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel. You will be asked for your password; this is normal. Type your password and press ENTER, and note that there will be no asterisks shown as you type it.\n\n*In the same terminal, type gnome-desktop-item-edit ~/.local/share/applications/ --create-new. After entering this command, a window will pop up allowing you to enter the Name of the program -- in this case, WebStorm; and the Command used to launch the program, which you must specify the full path to (example: ./home/infernouk/WebStorm/WebStorm.sh). You will also be able to add an optional Comment to describe the program, and you can add an icon by clicking the big icon on the left side of the window and then choosing an appropriate image file. When you are done, click OK.\n\n*Try searching in the menu for launcher you just created; it should be there. If not, then try logging out and back in.\n\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance :)\n", "Q: Medion Surf Stick seemingly not recognized by Lubuntu 14.04 Here is the lsusb output\nBus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:0158 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

At least it is not show in either the explorer (as an USB medium) or the available network connections. The provider for Internet access would be German company Aldi Talk.\nI would appreciate any help to get it running.\n\nPS: Reading the help I noticed that my OS is actually not up to date for this community, but I hope you won't abandon me for this.

(gedit eats the CPU if not saved every two minutes or so, but hey, I'm not complaining.)\n\nA: Okay, I think I got it to work, so here is what I did (read completely before trying to reproduce!):\nFirst I configured the network itself. There are enough tutorials how to do this for Aldi Talk under Ubuntu in the net, so I will skip that part.\nI installed gammu and configured it as it was suggested from the German site I got the tip from.\nsudo apt-get install gammu\ngammu-config\n\nConfiguration: set Port to /dev/ttyUSB, set Connection to at115200.\nI couldn't use rmmod usb_storage because the mod was busy, but I tried the other one:\nsudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0e8d product=0x0002\n\nwhere vendor and product are from MediaTek Inc. of the output of lsusb (see my question). That didn't returned any errors. So next thing according to the instruction was\nsudo gammu -c ${HOME}/.gammurc --entersecuritycode PIN ****\n\n(PIN hidden.) Console gave me\nError opening device, it doesn't exist.\n\nChecking with ls /dev I found that to be true. I tried the routine again, same results, rebooted, tried again, same results. Changed Port to sdb (which is probably the card reader of the netbook), got a different result:\nError opening device. Unknown, busy or no permissions.\n\nSince I couldn't really find other sites in the Internet with this problem, this was about the time I decided to post it here.\nNext day. Meanwhile netbook was shut down and booted up a few times as it happens. An idea came to my mind. I was still missing the device, but lsusb said it is there somehow, I just didn't know the proper /dev name. So without having the stick in the laptop:\nls /dev > before.txt\n\nPutting stick in and waiting for it to blink (which it has done all the time before, too)\nls /dev > after.txt\ndiff before.txt after.txt\n\nConsole gave me three new devices:\ncdrom\nsg2\nsr0\n\nI first tried to change the Port to /dev/sg2, started gammu, error: Unknown etc.\nChanged the Port to /dev/sr0, started gammu, error: Unknown etc.\nChanged the Port to /dev/cdrom, error: Not existent etc.\nHOWEVER directly after that last console return a window plopped up asking me for the PIN (which I actually entered when trying gammu). Then he asked password for the keyring (he usually does) and password for the device (sudo password worked). Checked connections, stick was available. Connected, currently posting through this connection.\nI should note that I didn't modprobe this time, usbserial was listed under lsmod (first time since problem that I used that command) and vendor/product ID for MediaTek Inc. returned by lsusb have changed since yesterday.\nIf it still works after next reboot, I will accept this answer.\n\nNext morning. Just rebooted. ls /dev showed the before-it-worked \"files\" with cdrom etc. No surf stick showing up in the network connections. Waited a minute. Nothing happened. Then\nsudo gammu -c ${HOME}/.gammurc --entersecuritycode PIN ****\n\nError opening device. Unknown, busy or no permissions. About 10 seconds later the surf stick dialogs show up again. After dealing with that, checked /dev, looked again like yesterday after-it-worked.\nSo somehow the gammu command lets the netbook think about what is really in /dev, even though itself doesn't work. But then again, it works for me even when I'm completely puzzled why.\n", "Q: Ubuntu hibernate and suspend Why hibernate doesn't work on my laptop but works correctly when I use windows?\nBy typing sudo pm-hibernate system goes to hibernate but starts with error.\n\nMy operating system is Ubuntu 16.04\nRAM:6 GB\nswap partition:7 GB\nlenovo z50-70\nI have a problem in suspend too. when system goes to suspend automatically, a blank screen comes up.

If the system shows the keys are alive, then you have the problem of connecting those keys to the sound controller. \nIf the keys don't have any effect, my experience tells me that you OS might be installed with the wrong keyboard layout.  The keys are not working because, well, the OS does not know they are there.

It would show its picture of what it thinks the keyboard ought to look like. The screen keyboard would light up, to let you test how it saw the keys.

I have a little grep command line that finds certain values in a text file and exports them into a .csv-file.\nHere it is:\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values a' | cut -d' ' -f9 >a.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values b' | cut -d' ' -f9 >b.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values c' | cut -d' ' -f9 >c.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values d' | cut -d' ' -f9 >d.csv\n\nHow can I modify the commands to get one (comma separated) .csv-file with four columns a, b, c, d?\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: As the first comment said, without a view of your \"file.txt\" it is tough to know for sure we are getting this right.\nMy first thought was why don't you take the easy road? The >> will append, so create the one thing, add the rest.\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values a' | cut -d' ' -f9 > a.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values b' | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values c' | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\ncat file.txt | grep 'Values d' | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\n\nThen I wondered why do you run cat at all\ngrep 'Values a' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 > a.csv\ngrep 'Values b' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\ngrep 'Values c' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\ngrep 'Values d' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 >> a.csv\n\nThat works, but it puts the 4 things on new lines, rather than as comma separated values. \nSo I concentrated on stopping the new lines from being inserted, and getting a comma instead. awk can handle that. \ngrep 'Values a' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 | awk '{printf $0 \",\"}' > a.csv\ngrep 'Values b' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9 | awk '{printf $0 \",\"}' >> a.csv\n\nand so forth. That works, but right before I hit \"send\" I realized that I was following along with you using cut and we don't need to. awk can select the 9th thing.\ngrep 'Values a' file.txt | awk '{printf $9 \",\"}' > a.csv\ngrep 'Values b' file.txt | awk '{printf $9 \",\"}' >> a.csv\n\nThat worked on a little test case I made, maybe not on your test case.\nIf I were doing repeated greps on data to build a file, I'd probably prefer to keep it in separate lines, rather than in a big, complicated tangle like the other one recommended. So I don't think I'd go for a one liner, four lines I can understand is good enough.\nIf you are going to do more shell work like this, I suggest you get a copy of the old book Unix Power Tools.  It has a lot of tricks like this.\n\nA: You could use paste\npaste -d, {a..d}.csv > all.csv\n\nor (skipping the intermediate files by using process substitution)\npaste -d, <(grep 'Values a' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9) <(grep 'Values b' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9) <(grep 'Values c' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9) <(grep 'Values d' file.txt | cut -d' ' -f9)\n\nThere are likely more efficient and elegant ways to do what you want that don't involve making multiple passes of the same file - but you would need to share an example that displays the format of your file.txt\n", "Q: How to securely send bank details to someone? I have completed my internship and my employer wants me send him my bank account details so that he can transfer me my stipend. How can I securely do this? I have Ubuntu MATE 16.04. My employer is not that tech savvy.\n\nA: For encrypted messages, you have generally two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Public/private (or rather hybrid) cryptosystems\nOpenPGP belongs to this category, also S/MIME does. The recipient will provide you with a public key, which you use to encrypt the message. The recipient will be able to decrypt it with his private key.\nThe advantage is that you do not need to transmit any secret through a separate, secure channel.\n\n*Symmetric cryptosystems\nYou and the recipient share a secret, which is used for encryption and decryption of the message. This is used with symmetric OpenPGP encryption, but also with encrypted archives (zip, rar) -- generally, symmetric encryption will be used when you encrypt with a passphrase that both sender and recipient must know.\nThe recipient does not need to provide you with a passphrase, but you will have to transfer the secret passphrase through a secure (and authenticated) channel, for example by meeting or calling him. The recipient must have software capable of using the specific protocol, of course.\nAs the recipient is not tech-savvy (and does not have an IT department taking care of this), likely he will not have setup public/private key cryptography. He will likely have some software around that is able to decrypt ZIP archives or office documents, but still you'll have to get the passphrase to him. Before sending encrypted messages, better ask if he's capable of receiving such.\nThe pragmatic solution: either don't care about sending the account information encrypted (in most legislations you'll just have some trouble in case of fraud,  but not actual loss of money and can reverse malicious bookings easily), or print/write everything on a piece of paper and send him a letter, or request a paycheck. Depending on the amount and whether the company is using it, using a service like PayPal might be an option, but will cost some fees (probably: you).\n\nA: If your employer is not tech savvy, the problem is more interesting. You can't assume he can set up PGP or SMIME mail, probably can't open a RAR file.\nSince I know almost certainly this employer uses MS Windows (don't all non-savvy people?), I know he has a zip opener in windows explorer. So If I were you, I'd 1) Make a txt file named \"bank.txt\" with the information in it and 2) create a password protected zip:\nzip -e bank.zip bank.txt\n\nThat will ask you for a password twice. \nSend that in an email attachment, then phone him up and tell him the password over the phone. If he's really not tech savvy, you need to think of a way to say \"please don't give the contents of this file to anybody or post it on your blog\" without hurting his feelings.\nThis is a pretty good security plan because the main danger you have is 1) mail server admins reading your mail and 2) an old copy of this file sits around in the employer's computer forever. You solve 1 and are pretty save on 2, unless the password gets written on a sticky note.\nIf you think any of this is too tough for him, just phone me up, give me your bank account number, routing address, PIN, and probably your SSN, your date of birth, address, and your mother's maiden name, and I'll be glad to jot it down on the back of an envelope and drive it over to the boss myself :) Just teasing about the last part.\n", "Q: Switching from Intel (Battery Saver) to GTX 970M doesn't work I just installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my Alienware 17R3, and managed to get the proprietary drivers from the Additional Drivers option.\nHowever, trying to switch to the 970M from the Intel GPU using the task-bar on top simply does not do anything.

As it is, it sounds like you're not booting from the Ubuntu USB at all, and only getting stuck booting from the encrypted hard drive. \nThere should be a boot menu or a setting in the BIOS/setup menu to change the first boot device away from the internal hard drive and to the external USB.\n\nA: If you can't remember the password, then that's all she wrote. \nAll you can do is install a new OS.

Now you can set default route\n  toyour gateway (router)\nBut you must get router ip first. Fortunately you set your interface\n  ip and this is where your network address comes from (ip masked by\n  netmask). To get your router ip requires change the address end .4 to\n  some common number like 1 or 138 or 254. The router ip and client ip\n  must belong to the same network to get ping functional. So try: ping\n  10.0.0.1 first when you set your ip 10.0.0.4, etc. If you can ping your router then set the default route:\nsudo route default add gw <yourrouterip> eth0 Cool you can check your\n  default route with the route command. The last step is set your dns\n  server. But check your default route before, just try ping some ip\n  outside your network, like google dns server 8.8.8.8 .\n\nover on this question.

Here is the output of find . in case that helps.\n\nA: I was hoping there was a known add-on to remove but I guess not.  What did work to fix this was the typical uninstall/delete old config files/reinstall\nsudo apt-get purge google-chrome-stable\nrm -rf ~/.config/google-chrome\n#download and reinstall\n\n\nA: I just realized the reason why I was having this exat problem was a video downloader called Video download Helper. I just deleted it from the icon on the home page of the browser and everything was fine. No more spam tabs either.\n\nA: There are some malware which tend to create such problems. Once they are installed as an extension, it gets difficult to open \"chrome://extensions\" because every time one tries to open it, it closes the tab itself. The way out from this in Ubuntu is: \n -- Open System Monitor\n -- Spot the chrome processes. There would be many processes besides the \n    one saying chrome because technically they are extensions. So, simply \n    try ending each such extra chrome process one by one. And every time, \n    try opening the \"chrome://extensions\". When each such process is \n    ended, chrome displays which extension has crashed. So, once the \n    malware extensions crashes while doing so, its name is displayed. And \n    then, when you try to open \"chrome://extensions\", it will work.\n -- Once opened, remove all such malware extensions from chrome.\nHope that was helpful.

How can I achieve this?\nDesktop not organised by name:\n\nDesktop after having organised by name:\n\n\nA: Arrange desktop icons alphabetically by command\nThe script below will rearrange a desktop like: \n\n...into an alphabetically ordered desktop like:\n\nOrdered:\n\n\n*\n\n*directories first, then files\n\n*from top to bottom, from left to right\n\n\nSet the number of items vertically\nFurthermore, you can set an arbitrary number of items vertically (rows); the horizontal spacing will be set automatically accordingly.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport math\nimport time\n\n# set the size of the squares (indirectly, by setting n- rows)\nrows = 10\n# set x/y offset of the matrix if you want\nx_offs = -15\ny_offs = -30\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndt = get([\"xdg-user-dir\",  \"DESKTOP\"]).strip()         \n# find size of the left screen\nleft = [int(n) for n in sum(\n    [s.split(\"+\")[0].split(\"x\") for s in \\\n     get(\"xrandr\").split() if \"+0+\" in s], [])]\n\n# size of the squares (icon area)\nsqr = int((left[1]/rows))\n\n# number of cols, squares\ncols = math.floor(left[0]/sqr)\nn_sqrs = cols*rows\n\n# define positions (matrix)\npos = list([[\n    str(int((math.floor(n/rows)*sqr)+(sqr/2)+x_offs)),\n    str(int(((n%rows)*sqr)+(sqr/2)+y_offs)),\n    ] for n in range(n_sqrs)])\n\n# list iconfiles, split into dirs and files, sort & combine\niconlist = [os.path.join(dt, item) for item in \\\n            sorted([item for item in os.listdir(dt) if not \"~\" in item])]\ndirs = []; files = []\nfor it in iconlist:\n    if os.path.isfile(it):\n        files.append(it)\n    else:\n        dirs.append(it)\niconlist = dirs+files\n# place icons in position(s)\nfor i, item in enumerate(iconlist):\n    location = (\",\").join(pos[i])\n    subprocess.call([\"gvfs-set-attribute\", \"-t\", \"string\", item,\n                       'metadata::nautilus-icon-position', location])\n# simulate F5 to refresh desktop, retry for max 20 secs if not in front\nt = 0\nwhile t < 40:\n    w_id = [l.split()[-1] for l in get([\"xprop\", \"-root\"]).splitlines() \\\n        if \"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW):\" in l][0]\n    if \"desktop\" in get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w_id, \"WM_CLASS\"]):\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"key\", \"F5\"])\n        break\n    else:\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n        t += 1\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool:\n  sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as arrange_dt.py\n\n*Test- run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/arrange_dt.py\n\nwithin 20 seconds click on the desktop, your new arrangement will be applied. If you run the script from a shortcut, while the desktop is in front, the arrangement will be applied immediately. If the desktop is not frontmost, the script waits for max 20 seconds. If time exceeds, simply press F5 to apply.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/arrange_dt.py\n\nOptions\nYou can influence the arrangement of the icons in three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*set the size of the \"tiles\"\n# set the size of the squares (indirectly, by setting n- rows)\nrows = 10\n\nThis will set the (max) number of icons vertically. The size of the \"tiles\" will, be equal (x,y)\n\n*set the horizontal offset\nx_offs = -15 \n\nThis will set the x- deviation from the default position of the icon-matrix as a whole\n\n*Set the vertical offset\ny_offs = -30\n\nThis will set the y- deviation from the default position of the icon-matrix \nAn example, using:\n# set the size of the squares (indirectly, by setting n- rows)\nrows = 6\n# set x/y offset of the matrix if you want\nx_offs = 50\ny_offs = 10\n\n\nExplanation\nThe explanation below is mostly an explanation on the concept rather than the coding\n\n\n*\n\n*To position the icons alphabetically, we first list the items on the desktop, using python's os.listdir(Desktop)\n\n*Then we split the files into two sublists; files/folders, and sort both lists, join them again, folders first.\n\n*Then we create the matrix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since the number of rows is set in the head of the script, we divide the height of the screen by the number of rows. Thus we have the size of the \"squares\" the icons will be placed in (centered).\n\n*Since the icons are similarly spaced horizontally, we can then calculate the (max) number of columns by dividing the width of the screen by the width of the \"squares\" in which the icons will be placed (per icon), rounded down to the first integer below.\n\n*In the image below, these \"virtual\" squares are visible, the red dot is where the icon is placed.\n\n\n*Then all we have to do is place the first icon on half of the size of a square, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n*To find the x-position of all other icons, we simply need to divide their index (starting with zero) by the number of rows, rounded down. The outcome will be added to the x position of the first icon (top left), for example:\nitem 10 (index 9): 9/4 = 2,25, rounded down: 2\nx position = position of icon 0 + 2 x the width of a square\n\nitem 17 (index 16): 16/4 = 4, rounded down: 4\nx position = position of icon 0 + 4 x the width of a square\n\n\n*To find the y-position of all other icons, we simply need the remainder of the index and the number of rows. The outcome x the width of a square will be added to the y position of the first icon (top left), for example:\nitem 10 (index 9): 9%4 = 1\ny position = position of icon 0 + 1 x the height of a square\n\nitem 17 (index 16): 16%4 = 0\ny position = position of icon 0 + 0 x the height of a square\n\n\n\n*Subsequently, we place the icons on the desktop, using the command:\ngvfs-set-attribute <path_to_dir_or_file> metadata::nautilus-icon-position x,y\n\n\n*Finally, we need to press F5 with the desktop in front, to apply the changed layout (refresh the desktop). If that is the case, it will be done immediately. If not, the script re- trys during 20 seconds if the desktop is in front, virtually presses F5 and breaks. If after 20 seconds the desktop still was not in front, you need to manually press F5.\n\nA: Inspired in part by the above question, I wrote iconic to solve this problem by letting you sort icons four different ways. Additionally it will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define a grid to space icons closer or further apart\n\n*Save icon desktop setup and restore it later for different setups home and work\n\n*Allow you to move icons to any of three monitors\n\n*Not suffer the \"lost icon syndrome\" that occurs when monitors of multiple resolutions are used\n\n*Sort icons alphabetically, alphabetically with \"Link to\" prefix ignored, sort by modified date ascending or date descending\n\n*Allow different grid size (columns x rows) depending on monitor, EG more on 4K monitor than 2K monitor\n\n*Instant Test button for quick experimentation on column x row changes or reserved space changes for monitor left, top, right or bottom areas\n\n*Test button will last for x seconds defined by you, clear all windows before test and restore them after test\n\n*Bash script for easy modifications\n\n\nYou can get the script on github.\nHere's the main screen:\n\nVisit the github page for iconic to see all the other screens, explanations and a copy of the script.\n", "Q: Cooling fan never reaches high speed, even if clearly needed CPU consumption goes very high (which obviously shouldn't) when watching video on Chrome. This is due to some regression that has appeared recently (it wouldn't happen before), but that is not the point here. Let's just assume that something is consuming a lot of CPU.\nI disabled intel_powerclamp and intel_rapl, so when CPU consumption gets high, I would expect the cooling fan to speed up as fast as it has to in order to cool down the CPU.\nInstead, what happens is that the fan NEVER reaches its top speed, not even close to that. And the whole system slows down and becomes unresponsive, in a very similar fashion as it used to when intel_powerclamp was enabled. But no \"kidle_inject\" processes show up in top. \nThe PROOF that the cooling fan is not spinning as fast as it should is that if I restart the computer, before the system starts to boot (at the boot menu), the fan spins at crazy speed. That proves (1) that it is capable of going faster than it does while the OS is running and (2) that the hardware \"thinks\" the temperature does require it, until the OS kicks in and thinks it knows better.\nI can only see two explanations for it:\nA) some software configuration is limiting the fan speed (perhaps because it is configured under the assumption that intel_powerclamp was there too and would do half of the job). So, because the fan at its current speed isn't sufficient to cool down the CPU, and since intel_powerclamp is not there limiting CPU use, some internal hardware protection of the CPU kicks in and throttles it, to prevent it from burning (or reaching the hard limit that would cause it to turn off abruptly)\nOF\nB) besides intel_powerclamp and intel_rapl which I have disabled (I understand how intel_powerclamp works, I have no idea how intel_rapl does), there is some other driver that works in some similar way, slowing down the CPU to make it consume less power.\nIn case (A) I would need to fix the configuration so that the fan is allowed to run at its maximum capacity and see if that is enough to keep the temperature down and prevent hardware protection to kick in.\nIn case (B) I probably want to try either \n[B1] disable whatever other software or semi-software based CPU throttling mechanism is doing a poor job, and see if the fan alone is enough, or\n[B2] somehow tweak some weight factor or threshold or priority configuration so that the fan is allowed to run faster BEFORE the CPU throttling kicks in (and hopefully even prevents it from happening).\nDoes anyone know how to figure out whether it's (A) or (B) and how to fix this?\nI read about configuring Thermald at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/ThermalIssues but it's terribly unclear and there are no practical examples.\n\nA: I just went through this exercise with thermald. First, I should point out that thermald was broken, even in fresh versions of 16.04, as it would not read its configuration file. This has now been fixed, so make sure that you have all of your updates installed.\nAlso, the page you reference is pretty good, and also contains an example thermal-conf.xml configuration file.\nNext, assuming that you've got thermald installed, stop the process, and restart it in --no-daemon mode, and carefully watch the output. It'll give you most of the answers that you need to configure your own thermal-conf.xml file.

I'm trying to get an application working with snapd and have run into some issues regarding AppArmor permisions. It seems that in order to have my app be fully functional, it needs some custom AppArmor rules that aren't provided by any of the existing interfaces. \nI'm able to get things working by manually adding additional rules to the app's AppArmor profile after snap installation under /var/lib/snapd/apparmor/profiles/, like this:\n/sys/devices/** r,\n/sys/class/net/eth0/address r,\n/dev/sda1 r,\ncapability sys_rawio,\n\nIs there a way to have the Snap automatically configure these when it's installed, or will I need to maintain custom post-install scripts in order to make these changes? \nThe bottom of this page shows yaml syntax that suggests it may be possible:\nservices:\n  - name: bar                       # uses 'default' template with     'network-client' cap\n  - name: baz                       # uses 'default' template with     specified caps\n    caps:\n      - network-client\n      - norf-framework_client\n  - name: qux                       # uses 'nondefault' template with     no caps\n    security-template: nondefault\n  - name: quux\n    security-policy:                # uses custom security policy as     defined by relative paths\n      apparmor: meta/quux.aa\n      seccomp: meta/quux.sc\n\nbut this is in reference to Ubuntu 15.10 (I'm using 16.04), and it appears to use syntax (e.g., 'services' instead of 'apps') not currently supported by snapd.  Thanks for any help you can provide.\n\nA: In 16.04 the way to do this is with an 'interface' defined in the snapd code, that is driven by a custom schema in your snap definition. There are a bunch already defined, and it looks like all you need are:\n\n\n*\n\n*a raw disk interface (iirc someone else wants that too)\n\n*a raw ethernet interface\n\n\nYou're unlikely to get a blanket /sys/devices/* landed, but I suspect you actually need specific types of access to specific types of devices, and those can all be designed and landed.\nThe best place to hash out what you need is in #snappy on freenode IRC, chat with zyga for pointers to code describing existing interfaces. Should be a simple patch to work up.\n", "Q: compilling and running C++ executables from ubuntu browser I have a question can I run a linux executable from Ubuntu (not from the linux command line)? I created a file demo.c” in the command line and then compiled it (then fixed the bugs then compiled it again) to the executable “demo”.  It compiles, runs and gives the correct results from the command line.  I did a chmod +x just to make sure I had the permissions right. I returned to Ubuntu went to files and folders, documents, home, “demo”, properties, permissions and made sure the “allow” box was checked.  Then back to home, right clicked on “demo” and clicked on run. No joy. I checked the command line to see if it had perhaps run there. Again no joy. If someone can tell me how to run an executable in Ubuntu I now have another question.\n   My next question is if I can run from Ubuntu can I also compile from within Ubuntu?\nThanks for your time and trouble.\nmbsailor\n\nA: Unless your program is calling some kind of GUI popup to appear, it will try to print to a terminal. Programs typically expect to have stdout ( output stream ) to be present. So what happens is your command runs just fine, Nautilus browser calls the shell to launch your program , but there is nowhere for that program to print. \nYou can go through a trouble of creating custom entry in Run as menu , or here is a simpler solution: \nOpen  text editor and make this file ~/.local/share/applications/run_executable.desktop  (NOTE ~ means your /home/username directory and .local is hidden folder) with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=RunExecs\nExec=gnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"%u; read\"'\nTerminal=true\n\nNow open file manager, and drag that new file to the launcher. Once you have this icon on the launcher, you can just drag and drop your compiled C code, it will open gnome-terminal and run it. I have this same exact setup in Ubuntu 16.04, no issues detected with this so far.\nYou can try to add that file as right click option to file manager as is shown in this article, but it may be a bit dated, and I personally never tested it, so can't it recommend or not\nEdit\nWhat I also learned yesterday from Jacob Vlijm's answer is that you can add custom scripts to nautilus. For example, create /home/user/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/run_executable.sh file with these contents:\n#!/bin/bash\nFILE=$(readlink -e \"$@\")\necho \"$FILE\"\nif [ -n \"$FILE\" ] ; then\n   gnome-terminal -x bash -c '\"$@\";read' bash $FILE\nfi\n\nMake sure it has executable permissions, by doing chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/run_executable.sh and restart nautilus if necessary . After that you can just right click on any executable file, and you will have scripts -> run_executable.sh option.\nNote that this question asks about both, compiling and running. I won't address compiling, because compilation usually requires providing options to compiler manually, such as in cases where libraries need to be linked. If user so wishes, they can modify my scripts, but I'd advise against adding a compile option and stick only with the running option\n", "Q: Bluetooth is not working on Ubuntu 16.04 My Bluetooth is on and visible, yet it does not detect any device and is not being detected by other devices.\nI know there are many similar questions around, but non of the proposed solutions seems to work for me.\nSome information is listed below, if anything is missing please let me know.\n$hcitool dev\n\nDevices:    hci0    80:A5:89:40:CF:0A\n\n$hcitool scan\n\n(When a detectable device is nearby.)\nScanning ...\n\n$lsusb\n\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 006: ID 13d3:3490 IMC Networks \nBus 001 Device 005: ID 0bda:57b5 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. \nBus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:0129 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

of\nusb-devices | awk '/13d3/' RS=\n\nto the description of the bug.\nYou can leave a link to the bug report and ping me in comments. I will take care of it.\nThis will not take much time to fix. I will build a test module and the BT will hopefully work with it. In the meantime the support will reach the stable kernels some time.\nUpdate: This issue has been fixed in official Ubuntu kernels.\n", "Q: kernel takes long load time nearly I bought a ssd and installed ubuntu 16.04 , everything is ok but my bootup time is too long instead of my friend's ubuntu , so i ran systend-analyze and find the kernel load time is too much more others : \nStartup finished in 12.541s (kernel) + 8.443s (userspace) = 20.984s \nI also attach plot  plot\nis the load time normal for ubutnu on a ssd ? \nthanks to your respons .\n mostafa@N55: ~ $ lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   500M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0 109.5G  0 part \n├─sda3   8:3    0  35.4G  0 part /\n└─sda4   8:4    0  93.1G  0 part /home\nsdb      8:16   0 698.7G  0 disk \n├─sdb1   8:17   0   7.6G  0 part [SWAP]\n├─sdb2   8:18   0  47.7G  0 part \n└─sdb3   8:19   0 643.3G  0 part \n\n\nA: Kernel load time isn't that much affected by using a SSD. It's a small file that gets decompressed to RAM and then runs from there. What is probably taking time is hardware initialization, not I/O.\nCheck dmesg messages and see if you can find any hardware that is taking that long to init, 12 seconds is indeed slow for current hardware. What is your CPU?\nThe plot is useless, as it only lists userspace, and your userspace boot time looks good.\n", "Q: How to watch Netflix in Ubuntu? I tried watching Netflix in Ubuntu, but browsers are not supported. It asks for IE. Is there any solution?\n\nA: There is an answer.

The re installation is at its first step \"Removing conflicting operating system files\"\nCommand window shows some processes, which suggests that reinstall is working.

I have never even noticied the re-install option you are alluding to but I couldn't expect it to work reliably. Too many edge cases.\n", "Q: Erasing When I Restart I recently got Ubuntu 16.04 and I like it so far.

There's an entry for this on the dialog box.\n", "Q: copy text to diodon/clipboard on boot How can I copy text to diodon/clipboard from terminal command? I work frequently in norwegian with is not my native language, so I would like to always have norwegian letters in my diodon to simply paste them.\n\nA: There is similar question in Launchpad, which says (@2013) that this is not possible.\nAs this does not work, I suggest to install Norwegian keyboard layout and  use shortcut to switch between layouts. I use it (for Russian) all the time. If you use standard Ubuntu, there is default shortcut Shift+Caps Lock and it is very convienient for me.\n", "Q: HDMI1 is disconnected I'm trying to get a secondary monitor working with my laptop.

I can get a USB dongle working, but I'm sure the laptop has internal bluetooth hardware.\nUpdate:\nI have halfway succeeded in getting the bluetooth to work by doing step 12 in the list directly below. I actually did this on Lubuntu 16.04, but will test it with Ubuntu 16.04 as well. I successully paired a bluetooth mouse, and am able to use it. However, it is laggy, but not to the point of being unusable. I am also able to send and receive files to my LG G4 via bluetooth. I am, however, not able to pair to bluetooth speakers. I tried pairing to two speakers of different brands, and it appears to connect briefly for a second and then disconnects.\nUpdate:\nI have also just gotten the bluetooth speakers to work on Lubuntu 16.04 by doing step 13 directly below. I also was able to get it working on a freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04. I posted the steps to do it as an answer below.\nWhat I have tried:\n1) Okay, so I have the Blueman Bluetooth Manager/BlueZ installed.\n2) I know the bluetooth programs are functional because I can plug in a bluetooth usb dongle and eveything works how it should with the dongle. I am able to connect bluetooth devices with the dongle.\n3) I also know that the laptop itself has bluetooth hardware apart from the dongle I plugged in, because I can unplug the dongle and boot into Windows 10, and bluetooth functions on the Windows 10 OS.\n4) I left bluetooth enabled on Windows as well.\n5) There are no hard buttons (that I can find) on my laptop to enable or disable bluetooth.\n6) In UEFI, bluetooth is enabled.\n7) In UEFI, Secure Boot is disabled.\n8) I have tried$ rfkill unblock bluetoothfrom this post to no avail.\n9) I have also tried $ sudo hciconfig hci0 reset which sadly didn't work and gives the output\n\"Can't get device info: No such device\"\n10) I have also tried $ sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/bluetoothd and sudo service bluetooth restart from this post.\n11) I have tried reinstalling software as suggested in this post:\n$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth blueman bluez-hcidump bluewho python-bluez  bluez-tools\n\n12) I was able to get bluetooth partially working on Lubuntu 16.04 by following the steps from this post by Klip.

Can you explain to me why Ubuntu permitted Windows have bash inside that OS?

I'm just a guy who uses Ubuntu; I have absolutely no connection to Canonical or this project, and I imagine most people on here are in a similar situation.\nHowever, Canonical developer Dustin Kirkland wrote the following on his blog post announcing the Ubuntu Bash shell on Windows:\n\nFinally, I imagine some of you -- long time Windows and Ubuntu users alike -- are still wondering, perhaps, \"Why?!?\"  Having dedicated most of the past two decades of my career to free and open source software, this is an almost surreal endorsement by Microsoft on the importance of open source to developers.  Indeed, what a fantastic opportunity to bridge the world of free and open source technology directly into any Windows 10 desktop on the planet.  And what a wonderful vector into learning and using more Ubuntu and Linux in public clouds like Azure.  From Microsoft's perspective, a variety of surveys and user studies have pointed to bash and Linux tools -- very specifically, Ubuntu -- be available in Windows, and without resource-heavy full virtualization.\n\nIn other words,it makes Windows 10 more attractive to developers, and gives Ubuntu a wider audience. Of course, different people will have different perspectives on who benefits more from the arrangement and what its possible side-effects might be down the road, but it's a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n", "Q: Driver for Ralink corp.

But I can't open it. How can I solve it?\n\nA: To answer your question \"why exe files can't run\":\nThe .exe files are Windows executables.  They are represented in a Windows-specific file format that the regular Linux operating system does not know how to load.  They depend on Windows-specific shared libraries (DLLs) that are not present on a Linux system.\nHow to solve your problem? \n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Wine on Linux may help, though it is not guaranteed to work for all applications.  (Wine depends on libraries that emulate the behavior of Windows, and that emulation is not 100% faithful to the original.)\n\n*If you can see the Windows files on the C: and D: partitions, there is a good chance that you have only clobbered the Windows boot loader.

If anyone has a better solution though I'd be happy to see a better answer.\n\nA: For some reason astrill isn't being registered with unity when it is installed.  You can fix this by copying it to /usr/share/applications/ and create a panel icon by dragging the icon to the panel.\nAstrill should have created a launcher on the desktop when it installed.  If not create the file Astrill.desktop with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Astrill\nGenericName=VPN Client\nComment=Browse the Internet safely with Astrill\nExec=/usr/local/Astrill/astrill\nIcon=/usr/local/Astrill/astrill.ico\nTerminal=false\nX-MultipleArgs=false\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Application;Network;\nName[en_US]=Astrill\n\nNext copy the file to /usr/share/applications/, change the owner to root and remove group write permissions.\n$ sudo cp ~/Desktop/Astrill.desktop /usr/share/applications/\n$ sudo chown root:root /usr/share/applications/Astrill.desktop\n$ sudo chmod g-w /usr/share/applications/Astrill.desktop\n$ ls -l /usr/share/applications/ | grep Astrill\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   314 Jul 10 12:54 Astrill.desktop\n\nAfter finishing, the last line should be the same with above (with a different time and date obviously).  You should also now be able to find Astrill using the unity menu.\nTo add a panel icon, simply ensure that the Astrill icon on the desktop is executable and drag it onto the panel and launch from this icon.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Having trouble transferring file to a new folder I get this message when I try moving a file to a new folder\nsudo mv bios.rom usr/share/higan/GameBoyAdvance.sys\nmv: cannot move 'bios.rom' to 'usr/share/higan/GameBoyAdvance.sys': no such file or directory\n\n\nI'm pretty new to Ubuntu; I'm learning.

I have even tried sudo mv bios.rom usr/share/higan/Game Boy Advance.sys\n\nA: Check that the file bios.rom is actually in the current working directory ~/Desktop by typing ls.\nIf you can see the file bios.rom, you just need to put a / at the start of the path to mv to\nsudo mv bios.rom /usr/share/higan/GameBoyAdvance.sys\n\nif the directory name has spaces in it like Game Boy Advance.sys, you need to use the \\ character to escape them like this:\nsudo mv bios.rom /usr/share/higan/Game\\ Boy\\ Advance.sys\n\nOtherwise mv will get confused...\nIf the file bios.rom is not in the current working directory, then you have to cd to the directory where it is first, or use the absolute path, for example, if it's in your ~/Downloads directory:\nsudo mv ~/Downloads/bios.rom /usr/share/higan/Game\\ Boy\\ Advance.sys\n\n\nExplanation of the error\nThe path usr/share... does not exist under ~/Desktop, which is the current working directory. usr is under /, the root directory.

I also formatted with\n$ fastboot format cache\n$ fastboot format userdata\n\nas suggested here.

How do I make my system keep the numlock turned on at startup?\nI am puzzled by this defect, and I want to solve this without having to install an external program as I am convinced that there is a setting somewhere.\nSo, how can I make my system keep numlock on at boot?\n\nA: The only solution I know of requires the numlockx package. To install it, open a terminal (Alt-Ctrl-T) and type the following lines:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install numlockx\n\nThen edit your Startup Applications and add a new entry. The command for the new entry should be numlockx on.\nThat's it! If you find a solution that doesn't require the numlcokx package, I'd love to hear about it.\n(See also: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Activating_Numlock_on_Bootup )\n\nA: I too was puzzeled by this dilemma. I searched hard and long to find a solution that doesn't require numlockx, as I was convinced it must be a setting in a '.conf' file. Guess what... I found it!\nTo keep numlock turned on at startup you need to edit the following file:\n/etc/sddm.conf\n\nFind the label general and add the following\nNumlock=on\n\nNow save your file and reboot. It's as simple as that.\nIn my case I had already turned on numlock in my BIOS, so I don't know if this works with numlock turned off in your BIOS. I haven't tested that. However, I assume that if you're looking to keep numlock turned on at boot time, you've probably already turned that on.\n\nA: Simple GUI point and click solution here:\nThis is the case with Cinnamon and I'm pretty sure any Ubuntu flavor.\nGo to SYSTEM SETTINGS -> KEYBOARD LAYOUT -> click on the OPTIONS button on the bottom right corner -> look for \"misc. compatibility options\" and click \"default numeric keypad keys\" and \"numeric keypad keys always enter digits\".\nAt this point you may need to restart your system for it to take full effect and will continue working from then on.\nI do not recommend installing numlockx or any other third party extension if you do not need it as this creates additional dependencies and can introduce bugs or security risks.\n\nA: in ubuntu 18.04 you can \nsudo apt install gnome-tweaks\n(assuming this are names of menu items in english (added germans in brackets))\n'keyboard and mouse' (Tastatur und Maus) /\n'additional options' (Zusätzliche Belegungsoptionen) /\nx 'various options for compatibility' (Verschiedene Optionen zur Kompatibilität) /\nset this checkbox:\nO 'Numlock On: Numbers; shift changes to arrows'\ngnome tweak installed allows a lot more to \"tweak\" on the system\n", "Q: How do I change phpMyAdmin access URL?

I have found this manifest file describing the packages included with Ubuntu: http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.manifest.\nThe file mentions a package called ubuntu-drivers-common and some stuff which seems to be printer drivers. Are these packages enough for automatic handling of drivers for things like network and graphics, or do I need more than this? And how are they used?\nDoes standard Ubuntu come with some sort of 'enhanced' font rendering that does not come with Ubuntu Mini out of the box?\nIn order to update packages and the operating system, would anyone suggest that I install Ubuntu's default update manager, or is apt-get better?\n\nA: As far as Ubuntu drivers is concerned, here is the info obtained from running the command: apt-cache show ubuntu-drivers-common\nDescription-en: Detect and install additional Ubuntu driver packages\n This package aggregates and abstracts Ubuntu specific logic and knowledge\n about third-party driver packages. It provides:\n .\n  - a Python API for detecting driver packages for a particular piece of\n    hardware or the whole system.\n .\n  - an \"ubuntu-drivers\" command line tool to list or install driver packages\n    (mostly for integration in installers).\n .\n  - a PackageKit plugin for WhatProvides() for types MODALIAS and\n    HARDWARE_DRIVER, to do the same queries as above through the PackageKit API\n    (for using in non-distro specific GUIs). This works with aptdaemon's\n    PackageKit compatibility layer (python3-aptdaemon.pkcompat) and with\n    PackageKit's apt backend, but _not_ with the PackageKit aptcc backend.\n .\n  - some NVidia specific support code to find the most appropriate driver\n    version, as well as setting up the alternatives symlinks that the\n    proprietary NVidia and FGLRX packages use.\n\nBasically, the package contains no drivers. It can help for those who are running a GPU by Nvidia or AMD mostly and sometimes intel when stuff like intel microcode or intel opensource drivers are installed.\nWith that said, the linux kernel should have all the stuff you need for network and graphics.\nIf you have nvidia or ati graphics, you may want to install the correct proprietary driver for your card and this package will help detect which proprietary driver is best suited for your particular model.\nPrinter drivers depend on your particular printer model and in some rare cases need to be downloaded from the printer manufacturer.\nAlmost all network drivers are available with the linux kernel and only rare cases need to be installed or compiled from source.\nAs far as font rendering is concerned, I don't think so and a basic search supports this hypothesis.\nFinally, I personally prefer apt-get but that is a matter of taste and preference. I prefer to run the following commands on a regular basis to keep my system up to date and do not  rely on the automatic update features of any automatic update manager:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you compiled any drivers from source code, you may need to recompile after running a dist-upgrade.\nIf you are not already aware, I suggest using the ubuntu mini.iso to install and you can use the following command to install a selected desktop after installation:\nsudo tasksel\n\nDo not select any of the \"live\" desktops from the list.\nNOTE: because of a bug in tasksel, DO NOT use tasksel to uninstall packages. ONLY use tasksel to install.\nIt should be noted that this is not for a UEFI system and will install in legacy BIOS mode!\nYou can find the 64 bit mini.iso here.\nYou can find the 32 bit mini.iso here.\nThis will give you a very minimal install.\nClick here for more info on the minimal install.\n\nAlso, as far as the install.sh script goes.

When the library snap is installed, the ideal is to write its registration somewhere in the system (otherwise, we should have to list all the installed snap, searching for the library snap).\n\nA: You would likely need to create an interface for your application snap and library snap to connect via.

I'm using Ubuntu Mate 15.10 on a F.Siemens laptop. I'm facing a time drift issue that I'd need some help with.\nThe time drifts by as much as 15 minutes in a 2-3 hour span. Forcing an update (with sudo ntpdate after stopping then restarting the service) works, but drift eventually returns. I noticed that at some point the clock corrected itself, which means npt does at some point run. But I'm a bit puzzled about its frequency, because on some occasions it seems to correct the time once in, say, two hours, while on others many hours can pass by without any correction.\nMy question is: which file/setting do I have to edit in order to a) check that the service is indeed active; b) adjust the frequency.\n\nA: Unless you reboot your system, I believe the system is set to sync your time only once every 24 hours.\nYou can run a cron job to query the ntp server to keep your time in sync more often.\nRun the following command to edit your cron jobs:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nIf the system asks, choose nano as the editor.\nThen, scroll to the end of the file and enter the following line to set the time every 30 minutes:\n*/30 * * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nPress CTRL + o and then press ENTER to save the file.

I do not want to see whether any other modifier keys like Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Super etc. are currently pressed. I only want a replacement for my missing LEDs.\nAre there any working indicators available?\n\nI already have read How to add a keyboard modifier state applet to Unity panel?, but it does not suit my needs. indicator-xkbmod only displays a wrong icon but does not react on keyboard NUM-/CAPS-Lock status changes, kbstate is for KDE only and key-mon does not show the NUM-/CAPS-Lock states but indicates key presses to modifier keys.\n\nA: Introduction\nDisclaimer: I am the author of this indicator\nThe lks-indicator allows showing the status of all the lock keys , such as Caps, Num, and Scroll lock. By default it shows green icon when no keys are engaged, and switches to red if one or more is engaged, while also showing text representation of which key is active.\nUsage:\nAs shown by -h option:\nusage: lks-indicator [-h] [--show-all] [-m]\n                     [--ignore-keys IGNORE_KEYS [IGNORE_KEYS ...]]\n\nlks-indicator - Indicates on/off status of Lock keys.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --show-all            Show all keys in label\n  -m, --monochrome      Use monochrome icon\n  --ignore-keys IGNORE_KEYS [IGNORE_KEYS ...]\n                        Ignore specified keys (C, N or S)\n\nStarting the indicator via command line is simple:\npython lks-indicator\n\nUsers can specify which keys to ignore , with multiple keys separated by spaces. For example,\npython lks-indicator --ignore-keys N S\n\nBy default , indicator only shows text representation of keys when they are engaged. If you want to always show them use --show-all option.\n\nPlease use, Quit button to close the indicator, as Ctrl+C shortcut via command line doesn't work well with app-indicators\nThe indicator by default works with color icons, red and green, but there's also -m option to use monochrome icon.\n\nInstallation\ngit approach\nFor those who have git installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /opt\n\n*sudo git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/lks-indicator.git\n\n*chmod -R +x /opt/lks-indicator/\ngit will also allow keeping it updated easily with cd /opt/lks-indicator ; git pull , so I strongly recommend using this method.\nZip package approach:\nAlternatively, you can download zip package and extract it where you see fit. Debian package is also available in the repository.\nTo make it start on every login into Unity , please consult this post: How do I start applications automatically on login?\nGnome Users : you will need AppIndicator Support installed , and optionally Gnome Tweak Tool. Otherwise the bracketed text wont be displayed, only red/green icon.\nThe indicator also has been tested in MATE and Ubuntu Kylin.\n\nA: I have also written an application indicator which, in my opinion, looks better.\nindicator-keyboard-led\nIt shows the state of the locks using filled/unfilled circles.\n\nDefault appearance of the indicator with Num lock on and Caps and Scroll locks\noff.\n\nMenu of the indicator, shown on click. The locks can be toggled by clicking\nthe respective item in the menu.\n\nAlternative (short) appearance of the indicator.\n  \nYou can also change which locks are displayed and in what order.\nInstallation:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:adrianiainlam/indicator-keyboard-led\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-keyboard-led\n\nAfter installation the postinst script will prompt you for preferences configuration. Visit the GitHub repo for full explanation on these settings.\nUsage:\nThe indicator will be configured to autostart on log-in. To start using the indicator after installation, log-out and log-in again, or manually start the indicator (search for \"indicator-keyboard-led\" in the dash).\nThe indicator should be shown at the top right corner, with a filled circle representing a lock turned on and an unfilled circle representing a lock turned off.\nClicking on the indicator should result in a menu with the three locks. Clicking on the menu item would cause the corresponding lock to toggle.\nBug reports and feature requests welcome.\n\nA: I personally use indicator-keylock, it's one the first apps I install when I setup my Ubuntu system.\nIt is included in ubuntu oficial repos for quite some time, works great and looks pretty.\nTo install, simply:\nsudo apt install indicator-keylock\n", "Q: Cannot install BytecoinWallet.deb I downloaded the latest BytecoinWallet but for some reason it doesn't want to install.\nAt first I gave it perms with:\nchmod 755 BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb\n\nAfter that I tried to install it with:\nsudo dpkg -i BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb\n\nAnd the output:\n(Reading database ... 268595 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking bytecoinwallet (1.0.11) ...\ndpkg-deb (subprocess): cannot copy archive member from 'BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb' to decompressor pipe: unexpected end of file or stream\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste returned error exit status 2\ndpkg: error processing archive BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb (--install):\n cannot copy extracted data for './usr/bin/bytecoinwallet' to '/usr/bin/bytecoinwallet.dpkg-new': unexpected end of file or stream\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon (0.5.3~bzr0+16.04.20160523-0ubuntu1) ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-6ubuntu3) ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1ubuntu5) ...\nProcessing triggers for mime-support (3.59ubuntu1) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb\n\nAfter that i tried to fix it with:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nIt didn't fix it. \n\nA: You might note that that particular version is smaller than all other releases by several megabytes so I suspect a faulty archive at the developer's end.\n\n\n*\n\n*BytecoinWallet-1.0.11.amd64.deb is 539.9kb\n\n*BytecoinWallet-1.0.10.amd64.deb is 3.2MB\n\n\nHere is a screenshot of the SourceForge download page to show this:\n\nGood news is that the slightly older version seems to install fine:\nwget --content-disposition \\\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/bytecoin-bcn/files/BytecoinWallet/BytecoinWallet-1.0.10.amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i BytecoinWallet-1.0.10.amd64.deb\n\nBut I have not tested the application itself, only the install process:\nandrew@athens:~$ bytecoinwallet --version\nbytecoinwallet 1.0.10\n\n", "Q: Message about no longer required packages on every install through apt-get I ran this command sudo apt-get install tor-browser and I got this output.

Put simply, I need to regularly back up and occasionally restore the firmware on an iPhone 6. \nI cannot:\n\n\n*\n\n*dual boot Windows—for some reason installing one OS makes the other unbootable & after days of headache & dozens of reinstalls I’ve decided to just leave Ubuntu be & not try to preserve Windows. Plus “just use Windows” is not really a solution on an Ubuntu forum.\n\n*use libimobiledevice-dev. libimobiledevice-dev doesn’t let you manage iOS updates or sync music anymore.\n\n*Buy another phone. This one should be obvious but for some reason some asshat always comments “too bad lmao shouldntve bought an iphone ;P”.\n\nA: (Old i5, 4GB RAM, CentOS 7, VirtualBox 5.1.22 with extension pack)\nI used the method to restore/update an iPad. It worked fine but was even simpler:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 virtual machines are much lighter than Windows 10. W7 by default sets 512MB for RAM while W10 sets 4GB. W10 wouldn't even boot. I set 1.6GB RAM for W7 and it worked seamlessly.\n\n*No need to change extension from vmdk to vdi nor to resize it.\n\n*VirtualBox extension pack is a must to enable USB 2.0. Remember that to 'plug' the device in the virtual USB port one has to select it in 'Devices>USB' when virtual Windows is running.\n\n*Just selecting the iPad which shows up under 'Devices>USB' as 'Apple ...' worked fine for me. Once or twice during restore/update it 'disconnected' but selecting it again was enough to resume process.\n\n\nOne other thing I forgot: Windows 7 virtual machine is 32-bit so download iTunes 32-bit for it.\n\nA: Okay, I have gotten this to work, and have successfully restored an iPhone 6 on Ubuntu 16.04. Posting my steps here as I’m sure there are plenty of ubuntu users like me who would enjoy knowing there is a (relatively) easy way to get iTunes working without having to borrow a Windows computer from a relative.\n1. Install VirtualBox\nInstall VirtualBox from virtualbox.org; pick the one that’s labeled for Linux hosts, since we are installing a virtual Windows on Linux (Linux is the host). Other virtualization apps may work too but I didn’t test them.\n2. Download a Windows Virtual Machine image\nGo to developer.microsoft.com and download a Microsoft Edge virtual machine. It’s free. Make sure the platform matches the virtualization software you are using (VirtualBox). The one I used was the Win 10 Stable version, but the others probably work too. Note that these images are very large (~4.7 GB) and can take a while to download.\n3. Extract the .ova image\nExtract the downloaded .zip to get the MSEdge - Win10TH2.ova file. The file is large, and it takes a while to extract, but on my computer Archive Manager was able to unzip it just fine.\n4. Import the .ova image\nDouble click the .ova file; Ubuntu should automatically open it in VirtualBox. Let VirtualBox import the .ova, all of the default settings are fine except for the Virtual Disk Image file setting, which should be changed from .../VirtualBox VMs/MSEdge - Win10TH2_1/MSEdge - Win10TH2-disk1.vmdk to .../VirtualBox VMs/MSEdge - Win10TH2_1/MSEdge - Win10TH2-disk1.vdi (the file extension is changed from vmdk to vdi. This is important for the next step, increasing the virtual hard disk size.\n5. Increase the virtual hard disk size\nThis is probably one of the more unexpected things you have to do to make iPhone backups and restores work properly. The default virtual hard disk size VirtualBox allots the virtual Windows 10 is simply not big enough to store most iPhone backups, which will cause them to fail. Fix this by navigating to your Windows VM directory (probably:\ncd VirtualBox\\ VMs/MSEdge\\ -\\ Win10TH2 \n\nand running this command:\nVBoxManage modifyhd MSEdge\\ -\\ Win10TH2-disk1.vdi --resize 128000\n\nThe number 128000 represent the size, in MB, that you’re resizing the disk to. 128 GB is probably enough to hold two or three iOS backups.\n6. Increase the Windows partition size\nJust upping the disk size isn’t enough to make iTunes aware it has more space to use. You have to use the Windows diskmgmt.msc command (in the ‘start menu’ or whatever Microsoft calls it these days) to open up the Disk Management tool. Then right click on the blue “Windows 10 (C:)” partition and select Extend Volume. By default it will expand the partition to fill the entire 128 GB.\n7. Install iTunes\nThis step is pretty simple, just install iTunes on your virtual machine the same way you would install iTunes on any regular Windows computer.\n8. Enable USB visibility\nYour virtual iTunes won’t be able to see your iPhone because USB is disabled by default. First you need to turn off the virtual machine (if it’s running), and install the USB extension pack from VirtualBox; it’s labeled VirtualBox 5.0.24 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack.\nNote that the information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone/iTunesVirtualBox is very out of date. I followed all of the steps but I’m not sure this is really necessary. If you do, do not perform step 4 (adding the line none /proc/bus/usb usbfs devgid=123,devmode=664 0 0 to etc/fstab), this will cause a black screen of death on your Ubuntu installation. Fortunately, if this does occur to you, you can always use the Emergency mode command line to navigate back to fstab/etc (cd .. ; cd etc) and use nano (nano fstab) to remove the offending line.\nNext go to the Settings editor in the VirtualBox Manager, and go to the USB tab. Check the Enable USB Controller box, and pick USB 2.0 (EHCI) from the choices. (If it’s grayed out, remember to turn off the virtual machine.) Then add an empty USB filter (blue circle) to the USB Device Filters list. Do not select a specific filter (green plus sign) like “Apple Inc. iPhone”, because that filter will fail to detect an iPhone in Recovery Mode, whereas the null filter will. \n9. Congratulations! You’re done!\nYou can now use iTunes with your iPhone on your Virtual Machine completely normally. You can even back up, update, and restore the iOS firmware.\n\nA: ! Important !\nDo NOT follow any of the commands used to install the extensions pack in step 8: Enabling USB visibility.\nJust double-click the extensions pack (after having VirtualBox installed and the pack downloaded) then click \"install\" and enter the sudo password. This makes VirtualBox itself install the pack so you can't accidentially mess it up.\n", "Q: usb flash drive is not mounting: \"no such file or directory\" My flash drive is initially recognized on Ubuntu. However, it does not mount and, after a while, Ubuntu tells me that there was an error because it could not find the directory of the flash drive (\"no such file or directory\"); consequently, the flash drive does not appear as connected anymore. I've searching around trying fdisk, testdisk, etc., but, since the flash drive is not recognized, they did nothing.\nI've ~1500 files with 66 kB (total of ~100 MB, in case this information matters) that I'd like to recover. I don't care if the flash drive cannot be recovered, my main concern is the files. What could I do?\nThe flash drive becomes hotter than usual after plugged in. May be a hardware problem?\n\nA: First, you have to check whether the flash drive is recognized or not. We do that by using the lsblk command, on terminal. \nExample:\nritesh ~> lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 111.8G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/efi\n├─sda2   8:2    0 107.4G  0 part /\n└─sda3   8:3    0   3.9G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdc      8:32   1   3.7G  0 disk \n└─sdc1   8:33   1   3.7G  0 part \nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom \n\nHere, /dev/sdc1 is the device file for my USB drive. If you cannot find your flash drive, then there might be a hardware problem. \nIf you find the device file, proceed.\nNow, you can try to mount through terminal, using the mount command.\nThe syntax is:\nsudo mount [device file] [location where you want to mount]\n\nExample:\nritesh ~> sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media\n[sudo] password for ritesh: \nritesh ~> lsblk\n\nIf you cannot mount the flash drive and you do not care about the file names, you can use PhotoRec from TestDisk to recover your data. (it works!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Download TestDisk from www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download  \n\n*Now, once you have downloaded the testdisk-7.0.linux26-x86_64.tar.bz2 file, extract it, either using Archive Manager or using the tar command.\n\n*Once you have extracted it, in the testdisk directory, you will find the photorec_static file: execute it using sudo.\n\n\nExample:\nritesh ~> cd Downloads/\nritesh Downloads> tar -xf testdisk-7.0.linux26-x86_64.tar.bz2 \nritesh Downloads> cd testdisk-7.0/\nritesh testdisk-7.0> ls\nAndroid.mk  documentation.html  INFO  photorec.8       README           THANKS\nAUTHORS     fidentify.8         jni   photorec.ses     readme.txt       VERSION\nChangeLog   fidentify_static    l     photorec_static  testdisk.8\nCOPYING     icons               NEWS  qphotorec.8      testdisk_static\nritesh testdisk-7.0> sudo ./photorec_static \n\nNow, as the photorec_static file executes you just have to follow some simple steps to recover the files on your flash drives.\nPhotorec runs in the terminal and it looks like this:\nPhotoRec 7.0, Data Recovery Utility, April 2015\nChristophe GRENIER <grenier@cgsecurity.org>\nhttp://www.cgsecurity.org\n\n  PhotoRec is free software, and\ncomes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\n\nSelect a media (use Arrow keys, then press Enter):\n>Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB (RO) - KINGSTON SUV300S37A120G\n Disk /dev/sdc - 3918 MB / 3736 MiB (RO) - Kingston DT 100 G2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>[Proceed ]  [  Quit  ]\n\nNote:\nDisk capacity must be correctly detected for a successful recovery.\nIf a disk listed above has incorrect size, check HD jumper settings, BIOS\ndetection, and install the latest OS patches and disk drivers.\n\nI have successfully recovered 320 GB of files from my external hard disk using photorec.\n", "Q: Quickly select entire page in Okular Okular provides a nice way to copy a selection from a pdf onto the clipboard as an image.

The software has been successfully installed (both ampps and magento) and it's running well. \nI'm trying to setup a crontab but it seems there is an error on the first line second 25.  \nThis is what I'm trying to add in to the crontab for the Ampps user, using the command sudo crontab -e -u ampps \n* * * * * /usr/local/ampps/php-5.6/etc\n/usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev/bin/magento cron:run | grep -v \"Ran jobs by schedule\" >> /usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev/var/log/magento.cron.log\n* * * * * /usr/local/ampps/php-5.6/etc\n/usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev/update/cron.php >> /usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev.dev/var/log/update.cron.log\n* * * * * /usr/local/ampps/php-5.6/etc\n/usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev.dev/bin/magento setup:cron:run >> /usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev.dev/var/log/setup.cron.log\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? \nI followed an error message in magento 2.1 admin that referred to this troubleshoot link for the version 2.0\nand to this configuration guide\n\nA: From my previous experience, it was due to a CR/LF character before the first cron line (since it was edited from Windows not Linux directly).\nI noticed and removed that char from a HEX editor.\n\nA: This error also happens if your /var/spool/cron partition is 100% full. Check your free disk space and make sure you have a few bytes free there.\n\nA: This kind of error may also occur if you are trying to reset cron variables to empty values like this:\nMAILTO=me@example.com\n* * * * * do some stuff with error reporting\nMAILTO=\n* * * * * do another stuff too verbose to receive emails\n\nNote the empty line after MAILTO= at line 3. This will result in the message:\ncrontab: installing new crontab\n\"/tmp/crontab.AvDwzo\":3: bad minute\nerrors in crontab file, can't install.\nDo you want to retry the same edit? \n\nThe correct way to reset MAILTO variable is to use empty quotes, like this:\nMAILTO=''\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In my case (and it seems to be OP's case as well), the issue was that I had a new line in the command to be executed, something like this\n5 0 * * * some_command -some_param\n-another_param\n\nThe overflowing line was of course interpreted as a new cron entry, and cron rightfully complained that the start of that line was not a valid minute identifier.\n\nA: Each crontab line must start with a time at which the command should be run and then the command. The general format is:\nMin Hour Day Month DayOfWeek Command\n\nSo, to run command at 10:15 every Sunday, you'd do:\n15 10 * * 0 command\n\nI'm not sure what your commands are, but you have lines that don't start with a time definition. I don't understand what lines like this are:\n* * * * * /usr/local/ampps/php-5.6/etc\n\nThat's a time but no command. You're giving it a directory. And lines like this have commands but no time:\n/usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev/bin/magento cron:run | grep -v \"Ran jobs by schedule\" >> /usr/local/ampps/www/localshop.dev/var/log/magento.cron.log\n\nSo, make sure you follow the format and you should be fine. If this is not clear, edit your question and explain what commands you are trying to run. \n\nA: The following command fixed my problem with this issue \nperl -pi -e 's|\\r\\n|\\n|' /var/spool/cron/root\n\nThe problem was that Windows line separators (CRLF) were upsetting the Linux based cron. Changing the separators to be Linux line separators (LF) fixed the problem.\n\nA: It can be an error while copy pasting from text editor. Everything should be in one line, e.g.:\nWrong:\nsource your-venv/basch/etc\npython3 /yourhome/directory/manage.py\n\nCorrect:\nsource your-venv/basch/etc python3 /yourhome/directory/manage.py\n\n", "Q: Thinkpad T460P: Scrolling jumps to top on 2 finger touch I've noticed in Chrome at least, if I take my fingers off my touchpad for a few seconds, and put them back down, there's a very good chance it triggers something that scrolls to the top of the page immediately (almost like pressing the Home key).\nIs this a feature I can disable?\n\nA: This bug is fixed in Chrome 52: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/Xh9GV7jNymo\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=609748\nUntil then, the 'solution' I use is to place one finger on the trackpad before the other.

I am a beginner and I want to copy/move a file from a specific folder to the desktop. I use cp and mv for those tasks. But I want to copy/move to the desktop.\nSay I want to move file1 to Desktop, I use\nmv file1 _____\nIn _____,\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Desktop, but it renames the file to \"Desktop\".\n\n*I used home/Desktop but it says no file/folder is found.\n\nA: How these commands work depends on where you are in the filesystem.\nYou can normally see where you are from your prompt:\nzanna@monster:~/Desktop$ \n\nThat's my prompt when the current working directory is ~/Desktop, the handy shortcut for /home/zanna/Desktop\nIf you're not sure where you are, you can type pwd and get the full absolute path\nzanna@monster:~/Desktop$ pwd\n/home/zanna/Desktop\n\nThe first / is important - that's the root directory, and all full absolute paths will start with it\nYou can use absolute or relative paths to do things with files. If you are in the directory where the file you want to move is, to move to your desktop, assuming your desktop directory is actually called Desktop (don't forget that Linux is case sensitive)\nmv file1 ~/Desktop\n\nbecause the current working directory is assumed.\nFrom anywhere in your filesystem you can do this:\nmv /path/to/file1 ~/Desktop\n\nbut replace /path/to with the real path! for example, if the file is in you home Downloads folder do\nmv ~/Downloads/file1 ~/Desktop\n\nmv also renames files... if the target is a file that exists and isn't a directory, mv overwrites it with the contents of the first file, and renames to the target. If the file doesn't exist, then file1 is renamed as the target without overwriting anything, as you discovered.\nTo copy a file instead of moving it, you can do exactly the same as above, with cp instead of mv. Only the behaviour is different in this case - the original file1 continues to exist in its previous location.\nTo learn more, you can check man mv and man cp\nA nice option for learning - you can get mv and cp to tell you what they are doing by making them verbose: adding -v. Here I move the file chocolate from the current working directory ~/playground to my Desktop with the verbose option, and I get some output in the terminal:\nzanna@monster:~/playground$ mv -v chocolate ~/Desktop\n'chocolate' -> '/home/zanna/Desktop/chocolate'\n\n\nA: You should use mv file1 ~/Desktop for moving and cp file1 ~/Desktop for copying to your Desktop directory.\n\nA: To move file1 from somedir to your desktop:\ncd /somedir\nmv -i file1 \"$(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)\"\n\nTo copy the file instead:\ncd /somedir\ncp -i file1 \"$(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)\"\n\nThe -i stands for \"interactive.\" It will cause the move and copy commands to prompt you before overwriting any existing file. \n\nA: Desktop is a directory in your user's home directory.\nIf your language is English it is called Desktop.\nTo copy some file there, you can run\ncp file ~/Desktop\n\n~ stands for /home/<username>\nIf your UI language is not English, it is called differently.\nYou can do a copy without finding the correct name by\ncp file \"$(xdg-user-dir DESKTOP)\"\n\nYou can get the name of the Desktop directory by\nxdg-user-dir DESKTOP\n\nYou can use mv instead of cp if you want to move a file instead of copying.\n", "Q: Cant boot Ubuntu 16.04 after removing laptop battery I had to remove my laptop battery as it was bloated and seemed to be a bit of a safety issue.\nSince removing it I cant boot Ubuntu 16.04 any longer.

I am using ubuntu 16.04. It is not showing even in windows\n\nA: First, see if it's showing up in /dev.  To do this, UNPLUG the device, and type:\nsudo partprobe\nls /dev/sd*\n\nThen, PLUG IN the device and type that command, again.  Notice what's different.  You should have an additional sdX letter, and perhaps some partitions on that device, such as sdX1.  (Replace X with b, c, d, e, etc., as appropriate.)\nIf you do, indeed, see a new device, that means the device is still working!  Does it have a partition on it (number after the letter)?  If so, that means it's still partitioned, and may still have a formatted, working partition on it.  Let's find out if that's true.  Replace \"sdX\" with the correct entry, such as, \"sdb\" or \"sde\".\nsudo blkid -d | grep /dev/sdX\n\nIf something shows up, you will see a filesystem type (like vfat, exfat, fat32, ntfs, ext4, hfsplus, etc.), which means that the partition is showing up as being formatted.  Let's find out if we can actually read that partition.  I'm assuming that you're not using /mnt for anything (by default, it's empty).  If you ARE using it for something, pick a different directory.  As before, replace \"sdX#\" with something like \"sdb1\" or \"sdd1\", as appropriate.  Also replace \"type\" with the filesystem type you saw with the above blkid command.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/test\nsudo mount /dev/sdX# /mnt/test -t type\n\nDid that command produce an error?  If so, the filesystem is dead, and you need to reformat it using Gparted or your preferred command-line utility.  If it produced no error message, you can then look in /mnt/test to see what's on the partition.  First, let's assume the mount command worked, and we want to look and see what's in there.\ncd /mnt/test\nls\n\nAre your files and directories there?  If so, great!  If not, you have a blank partition, and, hopefully, you didn't care about anything on that drive...but if you did, you can turn to some forensic tools like testdisk, dd/ddrescue, etc.  There are plenty of forum posts out there on data recovery; Google is your friend (good luck...).  If you have a blank directory, let's just double-check to make sure it's really mounted.\nmount\n\nDo you see your partition (/dev/sdX#) as being mounted on /mnt/tmp?  If so, then you simply have a blank partition.  If you want to be doubly-sure that the partition erased and fully-functional, you can reformat it with Gparted by doing this (see note, below):\nsudo gparted /dev/sdX#\n\nNote: you should probably clean up /mnt BEFORE you repartition/reformat/relabel anything.  To do that, close all programs, terminals, and windows that might be using the drive or mount point, and type:\ncd ~\nsudo umount -f /mnt/test\nsudo rmdir /mnt/test\n\nThen, right-click on the partition and format it as desired.  Alternatively, you can use mkfs.whatever to format it from the command line.  Replace \"whatever\" with ntfs, ext2, exfat, etc.  I STRONGLY encourage you to read the manual page before attempting this:\nman mkfs.whatever\n\nor\nman mkfs\n\nIf you want to be doubly-extra-sure that it's empty and functional, you can create a new disk label, repartition, and then reformat it in gparted (or using your favorite command-line tools, such as parted, gdisk, mkfs.whatever, etc.).\nPlease keep in mind that, anytime you repartition, create a new disk label (partition table), or format something, if you do that on the wrong drive or partition, you can lose ALL your data!  Be careful, and get it right.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Try using gparted! It usually works for me. Or use lsusb to see what's attached. fdisk -l for more info\n", "Q: Is there an iphone-like reminder app for ubuntu desktop?

Some time ago I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my PC. Everything went well and no problems so far. When the first kernel update came out I could not start it and got the following error:\nLvmetad is not active yet, using direct activation during sysinit\nVolume group \"ubuntu-vg\" not found\nCannot process volume group ubuntu-vg\n\nWhen I pick the old kernel from the GRUB menu it was ok and no problems there. After that another kernel update came out and also that one did not work out. Basically after clicking the newer kernel version I got the error and was repeated on the screen over and over again (with no end, not tested at least).\nI tried the following without any luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Error Run LVM LVMETAD socket connect failed: no such file or directory  (both answers)\n\n*lvmetad is not active yet; using direct activation during sysinit (tried the only answer to that one)\nNeither worked. I have my disk encrypted as it was an option during the install and I thought why not? I think something is going on with that although it is more like a gut feeling than hard evidence. I searched if it is possible to deactivate the encryption and was a pretty tedious work, so I kind of stopped looking for that, but if that seems to be the solution I can still try it.\nSo the installed kernel version was 4.4.0-21-generic (as displayed in GRUB). Works fine no problems. After that the installed kernels were4.4.0-22-generic, 4.4.0-24-generic and 4.4.0-28-generic (as seen in GRUB). Which all three don't work and give the exact same previous error.\nWhy am I getting the error and how do I solve it?\n\nA: I had the same error messages after I did a release-upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS in a chroot (chroot as described in this German article) from a live system.\nThe error occurred before the password prompt. As the LVM volume group is usually within the encrypted volume, it must be a dm_crypt/LUKS configuration issue.\nI found a solution here and will explain it below.\n\nIn my case, the name of the mapper of the encrypted volume was different from the name given in /etc/crypttab.\nI picked the name of the luks mapper from the output of ls -l /dev/mapper, after opening the encrypted device with the the graphical file manager. In my case, the output was:\ncontrol\nluks-87fc4c8e-017b-8482-cd09-7332fe351628\nvgubuntu-root\nvgubuntu-swap\n\nThen, as root, I changed my /etc/crypttab (please note the beginning of the line) from:\nsda5_crypt UUID=87fc4c8e-017b-8482-cd09-7332fe351628 none luks,discard\n\nto:\nluks-87fc4c8e-017b-8482-cd09-7332fe351628 UUID=87fc4c8e-017b-8482-cd09-7332fe351628 none luks,discard\n\nFinally I updated my initramfs:\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\n\n\nIt was a bit confusing that these two names were different. One would assume that when the mapper is created, its name is taken from the crypttab. Anyway, it worked.\nI did the whole stuff in a chroot, running a live system. It might also work from the busybox shell in which you drop after booting your system, but I haven't tried.\n\nA: New Answer:\nI realised that just editing that file won't work at least for me, for some reason the changes had been reverted. \nYou can do this if you want: startup Ubuntu on your older kernel (via grub boot selection menu) and download Grub Customiser, Go to \"General settings\" tab and select the older kernel boot  \"predefined:\" under \"default entry\". Save it. This way you will always choose the older kernel by default.\nOriginal Wrong answer:\nWhy not just use the older kernel? I also have the same problem as you and thanks to your finding on using the older kernel, I change /boot/grub/grub.cfg first menu entry's kernel from 4.4.0-28-generic to 4.4.0-21-generic and my computer finally able to boot completely.\n", "Q: command output redirection using '-< <( ... )' I needed to extract a shasum. This works, but can anyone explain why?\nsed 's/^.*= //' -< <(openssl dgst -sha256 filename)\n\nI'm familiar with the $( ) construct, but can't find docs for <( ), coupled with -<, which I assume is redirecting to the sed STDIN.\nI know there are easier ways, but this construct eludes me.\n\nA: The <( COMMAND ) Bash construct is called process substitution.\nIt evaluates the COMMAND inside and redirects its output to a FIFO, a named pipe that gets a virtual file descriptor inside /dev/fd assigned. It acts like a temporary file that contains the output of the evaluated command.\n\nThe < Bash construct is called input redirection.\nIt takes a file descriptor on the right side and redirects its content to the STDIN (standard input) of the command on the left side.\n\nThe - is not a Bash construct but an argument for sed that specifies its input file. The special value - means to read from STDIN (which is also sed's default, so it could be omitted).\n\nsed 's/^.*= //' - < <(openssl dgst -sha256 filename)\n\nThis line first runs openssl dgst -sha256 filename and caches its output in a FIFO. The file descriptor representing this named pipe is treated as input file that gets redirected to the STDIN of sed 's/^.*= //' -. This sed command reads from STDIN and removes every character before a \"=\" symbol followed by a space.\n\nA: The \n<(openssl dgst -sha256 filename)\n\nconstruct is a process substitution. It creates a file (or FIFO) behind the scenes and passes its name back to the command sequence.\n< \n\nis a regular file redirection, redirecting the contents of the behind-the-scenes file to stdin and\n-\n\nis a placeholder recognized by sed to indicate that its input is coming from stdin.\nSince sed is perfectly capable of reading from files, the -< seems unnecessary in this context; \nsed 's/^.*= //' <(openssl dgst -sha256 filename)\n\nshould work just as well.\n", "Q: How to only append to clipboard (but not overwrite current data)?

If you do not want that, remove the ; xsel -c from the end of each command.\n\nLong explanation:\nYou have to know that X contains 3 buffers, the primary selection, the secondary selection and the clipboard.\nYou know the clipboard from Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V etc. It's the buffer you normally use to copy and paste stuff.\nThe primary selection though is the buffer that always automatically contains the text you select, no matter which window it is in and without any additional user interaction.\nWe just have one problem: The buffer gets updated the moment you select a text snippet, but it does not get cleared when you click anywhere else to cancel the selection. It will still contain the content of your last selection.\nThe secondary selection is only used by few programs and not interesting for us here.\n\nThat means we can mimic the behaviour of Ctrl+C with this command below which copies the primary selection (last highlighted text) to the clipboard:\nxsel | xsel -ib\n\nxsel without any arguments prints the primary selection's content to STDOUT. xsel -ab writes (-i) the data from STDIN to the clipboard (-b).\n\nTo directly append data to the current clipboard content (without line break in between) instead of replacing it, we use the -a option instead of -i. This command will append the last selected text snippet to the current clipboard content:\nxsel | xsel -ab\n\n\nIf you really want an additional line break or any other formatting, we can pipe the data through printf or any other tool that you want to use to process it. Here's an example that reads both the last selection and the current clipboard content and joins them together using a newline:\nprintf \"%b\\n%b\" \"$(xsel -b)\" \"$(xsel)\" | xsel -ib\n\nxsel -b returns the current clipboard content. The format string of printf uses %b as placeholder for the arguments, \\n represents a line break. You can find out more about printf by typing man printf.\nBy switching the two arguments in the end of the string, you can reverse their order and append to the beginning instead of the end.\n\nIf you want to avoid appending the same data to the clipboard twice accidentally (you will have to select it again if you want to append it twice!), you can clear the primary selection buffer manually after the command has been performed using this:\nxsel -c\n\nSimply run that after the basic clipboard appending command, like that:\nprintf \"%b\\n%b\" \"$(xsel -b)\" \"$(xsel)\" | xsel -ib ; xsel -c\n\n\nSo knowing all this, you can write commands for your keyboard shortcuts that do exactly what you want, but remember that our one-liners all make heavy use of Bash features like piping, so you need to run them with Bash:\nbash -c 'COMMAND'\n\nSee the TL;DR section at the top of the answer for a command list suitable for creating shortcuts.\n\nA: X server has multiple clipboards. The one with Ctrl + C is referred to as clipboard, the one where you highlight something is called primary. xclip allows pasting output of either . For example I copied portion of your question, but highlighted some other text in terminal:\n\nYou can further use that idea in a script  that is connected to keyboard shortcut. In fact, I have written a script , which is posted as github gist\nBasic idea is to bind it to keyboard shortcut. Highlight what you want appended, then press the shortcut. For instance, I've bound mine to Ctrl+Alt+V . Exact command is python /path/to/file.py\nExample of Usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the I have a rather large file part from your post and copy with  Ctrl + C\n\n*Highlight something else , for example That is so that I can have a keyboard shortcut\n\n*Press your shortcut ( mine was Ctrl+Alt+V)\n\n*Release the appended clipboard somewhere with Ctrl + V . The resulting output is: I have a rather large fileThat is so that I can have a keyboard shortcut\nScript source\n import gi\n    gi.require_version('Notify', '0.7')\n    from gi.repository import Notify\n    import subprocess\n    import os\n    import sys\n\n    # This script is meant to be bound to keyboard shortcut\n\n    def send_notification(title, text):\n        Notify.init(sys.argv[0])\n        n = Notify.Notification.new(title, text)\n        n.show()\n\n\n    def run_cmd(cmdlist):\n        # function for running \n        try:\n            stdout = subprocess.check_output(cmdlist)\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n              send_notification(sys.argv[0],\"Clipboard error\")\n              sys.exit(1)\n        else:\n            if stdout:\n                return  stdout\n\n\n\n    # get contents of both clipboards\n    clip = run_cmd(\"xclip -o -sel clip\".split())\n    primary = run_cmd(\"xclip -o -sel primary\".split())\n\n    # write to temp file contents\n    # of both clipboards appended\n    temp_file = \"/tmp/append.clip\"\n    f = open(temp_file, \"w\")\n    f.write( clip + primary  )\n    f.close()\n\n    # Read the new contents into clipboard\n    run_cmd((\"xclip -sel clip \" + temp_file).split())\n\n    # clean up\n    os.remove(temp_file)\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*xclip must be installed via sudo apt-get install xclip\n\n*I've written a clipboard manager indicator for Ubuntu with Unity desktop, that can use regular expressions (sed and python's re style) to append a repeated string to the clipboard. For instance, if you frequently need to append same string over and over, you can use the following python re regex:\n\n\n\n\nA: Here is another very easy method that uses a short Bash script.\nFirst make sure you have xclip installed.\nThen create your bash script as follows:\n#!bin/bash\np=$(xclip -selection primary -o)\nc=$(xclip -selection clipboard -o)\nnew=$'\\n'\necho \"$c$new$p\" | xclip -selection clip\n\nLet's name this file apndpc.sh and put it in some folder, say ~/myscripts\nNow bind a user defined key to this. Do this by System settings>> Keyboard and click on Shortcuts tab. Click on Custom Shortcuts and then click on + sign to add your desired key combination. In the command box put:\nbash -c  'bash ~/myscripts/apndclp.sh '\nThen define your key combination. I use ALT+3 to trigger the action.\nThat is it. You are ready for your large scale copying operation. Use the normal Ctrl+c (or righ click and select copy) to copy the first chunk of text. Select the next chunk (only select NOT copy) and then press your shortcut key (ATL+3). This will append the selected text to the clipboard. Keep doing that until you are done. Then paste as usual, ie. CTRL+v (or righclick and select paste) to dump the final accumulated text.\nIf you do not like string manipulation in the above script then use this script instead:\n#!bin/bash\n# this is another version of clipboard append tool\n# here we use a temporary file to append highlighted text to the clipboard\n# the temporary file is deleted at the end of the operation\n\ntmpfile=\"file111000111\"\nxclip -selection clipboard -o  > $tmpfile   # first dump the current clipboard to the tmpfile\nprintf '\\n' >> $tmpfile                     # then add new line\nxclip -selection primary -o >> $tmpfile     # and finally add the highlighted text\ncat $tmpfile | xclip -selection clip        # now read the file back into the clipboard\nrm $tmpfile             # and remove the tempfile\n\n\nA: I use a clipboard manager called clipit.\nThen whenever I want to see the last things on the keyboard I do this on console:\nstrings ~/.local/share/clipit/history\n\nIt will print clipboard history separated by \\n.\n", "Q: How to disable HTTP referrer in Firefox? I feel that the HTTP referrer is a violation of my privacy (the HTTP header field that identifies the webpage you just came from which was linked to the webpage you are going to) and I understand that some browsers allow for one to then disable it.\nHow can this be done in Firefox (currently version 47)? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20.\nPreferably I would like to have 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ability to have it on for everything as is default\n\n*The ability to have it disabled only when the domain you have come from is third-party to the one you are going to\n\n*The ability to disable is completely even when just going to the sub-domain or another page of a website\n\n\nA: The Firefox add-on RefControl allows you to set a global Referer behaviour, which can be overwritten for specific domains. \nThe behaviours are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal (like Firefox works by default)\n\n*Block (send no Referer at all)\n\n*Replace (sends the root address of the current domain as Referer)\n\n*Specific (allows you to define a string yourself which should be sent as Referer)\n\n\nFor all these behaviours you can enable if they should work for all links or only for links to other domains.\n(The last update is from 2014-12, but it still works fine with current Firefox versions.)\n\nA: In the URL bar of Firefox, go to about:config.\nIn the search box of the about:config page, enter the following:\nNetwork.http.sendRefererHeader\n\nDouble click on Network.http.sendRefererHeader and change the value from 2 to 0 to disable the referrer header.\nThe following values are accepted:\n\n0 – Disable referrer.\n1 – Send the Referer header when clicking on a link, and set document.referrer for the following page.\n2 – Send the Referer header when clicking on a link or loading an image (default).\n\nSource\nIt should be noted that some websites such as google and tumblr include the referrer in the link URL rather than the header.\nThere is an addon which fixes this problem and removes the redirect from google results but it doesn't seem to work on google images (click here for more info).\nThere is also a newer option which might be of more interest to you called network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy. The options you can set for this are:\n\n0 - No restrictions (default).\n1 - Base domain must match (send from a.example.com to b.example.com).\n2 - Full host name must match (only b.example.com to b.example.com).\n\nSource\n\nA: There are Firefox Addons that can accomplish this. They tend to make it easy to toggle on/off sending the referrer header, and do not require manual modification of Firefox's configuration. For example, \nSmart Referer:\n\nSend referers only when staying on the same domain.\nYou can whitelist domains with wildcards and configure other things, look in the preferences page of the addon in the addon manager.\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer/\nToggle Referrer:\n\nThis addon allows a user to toggle referers between 3 states:\nReferer 0: Never send the Referer header or set document.referrer\nReferer 1: Send the Referer header when clicking on a link, and set document.referrer for the following page\nReferer 2: Send the Referer header when clicking on a link or loading an image, and set document.referrer for the following page. (Default)\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-referer/\nYou can find even more by searching the Firefox Addons site for \"refer\" or \"referrer\".\n", "Q: Mouse clicklock needed for accessibility!

How this happened in your setup, I do not know because this is not able to be replicated on ANY setup I have ever worked with (including upgrade setups).\nHere's some things you must remove from your sources.  Lucid Security is dead, and has been for an eon, and including Debian repos in Ubuntu will break things:\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security main multiverse\ndeb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy-backports main\ndeb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main\n\nThese three are at the bottom of your /etc/apt/sources.list file.\nNever mix Debian and Ubuntu repositories together on the same system.  EVER.\nThis is what breaks installations majorly.  Start by removing the repositories I specified, and using sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -f again, and see if the issues of unmet dependencies still happen.\n\nA: Taking you literally - \"after installing a new Ubuntu version (16.04\", -  before trying to install anything with apt you must refresh your sources, ie.\nsudo apt update\n(in 16.04 one can just use apt rather than apt-get, it a bit more full featured\n", "Q: How can I make the command \"eclipse myprogram.c\" work in terminal? As the title says how can I make that command work. I have eclipse installed in my /opt/ folder and I did make a destop file with:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=4.6\nName=Eclipse Neon C\nGenericName=IDE\nComment=Eclipse Neon for c/c++ developers\nExec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm\nType=Application\nCategories=Utility;Application;\n\nHowever whenever I type eclipse myprogram.c, I get the following error\"\nThe program 'eclipse' is currrently not installed. You can install it by typing: \nsudo apt install eclipse-platform.\n\n\nA: The eclipse binary, is what is executed on the command line.  Unlike the Desktop and Dash which can use application launchers, you have to make sure the binary is stored in your PATH variable in the command line.\nIf you want to make this usable one-time, then run export PATH=\"/opt/eclipse:$PATH\".\nIf you want this to work perpetually for the future, then we need to make sure every time the shell is opened yourself, and add the /opt/eclipse folder to your PATH so that eclipse is correctly interpreted by your terminal.  If you are running Bash, add it to ~/.bashrc, run source ~/.bashrc, and then run your original command again:\nexport PATH=\"/opt/eclipse:$PATH\"\n\n\nA: If you drop your .desktop file into .local/share/applications, then the eclipse program will be found.\nWhat I don't know is if you can pass it a parameter like myprogram.c, without modifying your exec line in your .desktop file. If it won't pass your myprogram.c parameter, you can try changing the exec line to \"Exec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse $1\", without the quotes, or maybe Exec=\"/opt/eclipse/eclipse $1\" with the quotes, and see if that works. postnote: maybe the $1 should be %F.\nIf that doesn't work, maybe some other expert here can help more.\nCheers, Al\n", "Q: Display color calibration Where can I find an option or an application to display color calibration as in Windows 7?\n\n\nA: I found something in Application-> System tools-> Preference-> Display\nThen you should have something like Color (where you  see keyboard, power management, printers).

We have incoming email filtering is enable using postfix and spamassassin. I have searched google but does not find exact answer while some searches gives some clues to some extent of solution.\nWhat I need is please give me a complete layout of what should I have to be done in whole.\nThanks\n\nA: I believe this has already been answered on ServerFault https://serverfault.com/questions/126282/postfix-check-outgoing-mail-for-spam.\nYou can use spamassassin for outgoing as well as incoming filtering.  It can be used also for internal mail.  While it is commonly disable in both these cases, it is useful to know how to enable this functionality in case of spam outbreaks on your systems.\nOther approaches used include throttling send rates, content and virus filtering, and authentication.  On Linux (Ubuntu) you can also limit the ability to send traffic on port 25 (SMTP) to postfix in the firewall.  \nYour firewall should allow only your authorized mail servers to send email to the internet.  These should have appropriate DNS setting such as rDNS and SPF records.  Your organization may also want to have DKIM and DMARC records for the mail domain. \n", "Q: Kubuntu 16.04 Themes do not apply correctly I'm pretty new in the world of KDE but chose to give Kubuntu 16.04 a try on both my Desktop and my Laptop.\nBoth are fairly recent installations and haven't been modified that much.\nNow for my problem:\nI simply wanted to change my theme to a dark one in the System Settings. So I went to Workspace Theme > Look & Feel and clicked on \"Breeze Dark\". So far so easy. But something is not right.\nThe task bar changes, the plasma search bar changes and e.g. the background of the dolphin main view changes. But that's it. The system settings window is still white, the dolphin sidebar is still white, other qt apps (that should be affected by the theme change) still remain white. Even multiple restarts didn't help anything...\nHere is a screenshot of dolphin so you can see what I mean:\n\nThe issue appears on both Desktop and Laptop which should exclude a hardware fault.

Still have access to drive but GParted cannot read contents I have an external 1TB HDD (USB) formatted to NTFS, and wanted to shrink the partition about 300GB and create an ext4 partition. So I opened up GParted and done that. During the resize partition (I think around 50-60% of the \"Moving\" operations), another program on my computer crashed and forced me to restart Xorg.\nThe weird thing is that I still have access to my NTFS drive and can read and write to it with no problems, and if I open it in GParted while mounted it behaves normally (like no action happened). Except, if I unmount the drive, Gparted shows the NTFS partition as occupying the whole disk but cannot display how much is being used. (So I can no longer resize, etc). When right-clicking on the partition and choosing \"Information\", I get this warning:\nUnable to read the contents of this file system!\nBecause of this some operations may be unavailable.\nThe cause might be a missing software package.\nThe following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support:  ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g.\n\nBut, like I said earlier, I have access to all the content on it through the file manager when it's mounted... Do you have any suggestions on what might be wrong?\nPS: I'm running elementary (based on Ubuntu 12.04).\n\nA: Hopefully, the NTFS partition's list of locations on the disk where the data for each file lies is correct. The fix under that condition is fairly easy if you can copy the files to a different drive. Here's how:\nRemount the drive read-only\nThe first thing to do is to stop all writing to the drive. Remount it read-only by opening a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T), and run the following:\nmount | fgrep media\n\nIt should tell you the external drives you have. For example, mine looks like this:\n/dev/sdb1 on /media/username/EC-FLASH type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,showexec,utf8,flush,errors=remount-ro,uhelper=udisks2)\n\nMake sure the mount point (the /media/username/EC-FLASH part in the example) is correct for your external drive. If it is, take the very first part (the /dev/sdb1 part in the example), and run the following, replacing /dev/sdb1 with what showed up for your drive:\nsudo mount -o remount,ro /dev/sdb1\n\nPreserve the files\n\n\n*\n\n*Check all the files that you care about. Take your time on this. Do they open? Are the contents correct?\n\n*If anything is messed up, STOP. Don't continue with this guide, as it won't be able to fix messed up files.\n\n*Copy the files to a different drive.\n\n\nFix the external drive\n\n\n*\n\n*In GParted, delete all partitions on the problematic external drive.\n\n*Create whatever partitions you want, making sure they get formatted.\n\n*Copy the files back to the NTFS partition.\n\n", "Q: uGet has a problem while downloading some file and always retry until it reached the limit Here's the error messsage :\n\n\n*\n\n*Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache\n\n*Resolving timed out after 15528 milliseconds\n\n*Closing connection 1\n\n\n\n*Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache\n\n*Resolving timed out after 15529 milliseconds\n\n*Closing connection 2\n\n\nand loop more..\nHow do i solve this issue?\n\nA: One of these options can solve the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Uget and Delete .config/uGet folder. then open uget and see the problem solved.\n\n*using aria2 instead of curl. go to the uGet settings edit>settings>plug-in and change plug-in matching order to the aria2 or aria2+curl\nIf you don't have aria2:\nsudo apt-get install aria2\n\n", "Q: Suspect of keylogger/screen logger in Ubuntu machine Seems my Ubuntu was hacked by a site while browsing. Is there a way that I can remove any logging software that may have been installed, or identify if a threat is present?\n\nA: Using RKHUNTER for rootkit and malware checking\nAfter a hacker attack, we should search for rootkits and malwares in our machine. These malicious software can corrupt files and compromise our control over the machine.\nThere are some softwares to help us searching for these malicious softwares, and one of them is RKHUNTER.\nWhats is rootkit?\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nA rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious,\n  designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that\n  would not otherwise be allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user)\n  while at the same time masking its existence or the existence of other\n  software. The term rootkit is a concatenation of \"root\" (the\n  traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating\n  systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers to the software components\n  that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has negative connotations\n  through its association with malware.\nRootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it\n  once they've obtained root or Administrator access. Obtaining this\n  access is a result of direct attack on a system (i.e.), exploiting a\n  known vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password\n  (obtained by cracking or social engineering). Once installed, it\n  becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain\n  privileged access. The key is the root or administrator access. Full\n  control over a system means that existing software can be modified,\n  including software that might otherwise be used to detect or\n  circumvent it.\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to\n  subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods\n  include using an alternative and trusted operating system,\n  behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and\n  memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically\n  impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the\n  kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only\n  available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware\n  rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized\n  equipment.\n\nWhats is malware?\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, is a kind of software that can\n  be installed on a computer without approval from the computer's owner.\n  There are different kinds of malware that can hurt computers, such as\n  viruses and spyware. These programs can steal passwords, delete files,\n  collect personal information, or even stop a computer from working at\n  all. Computer security or anti-malware software is usually good at\n  stopping malware from installing itself. When security software is not\n  installed, malware can get into the computer. Getting rid of malware\n  can be difficult, even when using programs designed to remove it.\n\nInstalling RKHUNTER\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal: ctrl+alt+t\n\n*Execute this command:\nsudo apt-get install rkhunter\nYou can left postfix unconfigured if installation asks for its configuration. Postfix is only used to send e-mail alerts, and can be configured later, when you want to use this feature.\nScanning your system\n\n\n*\n\n*Update rkhunter database. Execute:\nrkhunter --update\nsudo rkhunter --propupd\n\n*Check your system with:\nsudo rkhunter -c\n\n*RKHUNTER output is colorful and easy to understand. The software checks for several items in the system and every time an item is OK or a malware is not found, these messages are shown in green text. If something needs your attention, the text \"Warning\" is shown in red. If you want to see just the WARNINGS, use the command sudo rkhunter -c --rwo.\n\n*If you want to take a look at the log, execute:\ncat /var/log/rkhunter.log\nMore information at:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rkhunter\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rkhunter-to-guard-against-rootkits-on-an-ubuntu-vps\nhttp://www.tecmint.com/install-rootkit-hunter-scan-for-rootkits-backdoors-in-linux/\n", "Q: Install ubuntu desk top 16.04 after downloading So I've done what was recommended by backing my files and downloaded ubuntu desktop 16.04. Now from the downloads how do I get it on to a cd in order to install it.  Using the outdated 10.04. \n\nA: First, you need to make sure you have a drive that can burn DVDs.

I see \"301 Moved Permanently\", but why? \nHere is some sample...\nCall:\nsudo wget --output-document=/home/main/nfl_liveupdate_scorestrip_ss.xml URL \"https://nfl.com/liveupdate/scorestrip/ss.xml\"\n\nOutput log:\n--2016-07-10 20:12:42--  http://url/\nResolving url (url)... 52.0.146.161, 52.200.98.122\nConnecting to url (url)|52.0.146.161|:80... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://lyrics.url.com/ [following]\n0 redirections exceeded.\n--2016-07-10 20:12:42--  https://nfl.com/liveupdate/scorestrip/ss.xml\nResolving nfl.com (nfl.com)... 23.63.181.201\nConnecting to nfl.com (nfl.com)|23.63.181.201|:443... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/scorestrip/ss.xml [following]\n\n\nA: Your wget command contains the argument \"URL\" after --output-document=... and before the actual URL that you want.  I don't know what you expect that to do, but what it's actually doing is telling wget to fetch the page at the URL \"URL\", which wget interprets as \"http://url.com\", which redirects to http://lyrics.url.com/, and thus the behavior you're seeing here happens.  Get rid of the \"URL\" argument.\n\nA: This might be confusing, but it's actually \"okay\". The domain \"nfl.com\" returns a different IP address than \"www.nfl.com\" does, and the content delivery network is configured to redirect you to the correct address. If you use \"http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/scorestrip/ss.xml\" (notice the \"www\"!) to begin with, there will be no redirect.\n", "Q: pdfsam app won't work on 16.04 LTS When I had 12.04 LTS, pdfsam worked great.  Now with 16.04 LTS, when I install pdfsam from the Ubuntu Software Center, the pdfsam icon appears in the launcher and the Software Center still shows the INSTALL button for pdfsam which I guess means pdfsam has not been installed.  If I click on the pdfsam launcher icon, it fails...Sorry, Ubuntu 16.04 has experienced an internal error.  Also, an error log file is created that begins with \"A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment\".  How should I proceed?\n\nA: pdfsam just doesn't work on 16.04. Live with that and try another pdf app like : PDF MOD, PDF Shuffler, PDF Chain or even Master PDF Editor (probably the best pdf editor in linux). I personally prefer Foxit PDF Editor which works well under Wine.\n\nA: I had the same experience. It worked fine before upgrading to 16.04, but not after. I got it to work again by installing a newer version of the Java JRE and then telling the launcher to use the new JRE. I installed the Java JRE from Oracle (you can get it at java.com). \nTo tell pdfsam to use the new Java, edit the file at /usr/bin/pdfsam (you might need to do this as root). In the file on my machine, at line 36 I added this:\nJAVA=/home/mike/java/jre1.8.0_101/bin/java\n\nNote that I installed the Java JRE in my home directory. Maybe not the best place to do it, but I'm the only person using this machine so this works fine for me. You'll need to change the line above to whatever location you chose to install the JRE to.\nThe old Java JRE is still on my machine for any programs that still need it, so this should not affect anything else you have going on your computer.\nGood luck!\n\nA: In my case the problem was related to the fact that ubuntu 16.04 uses openjdk 9 by default but installing jdk 8 made the trick. Here's what I did after installing the malfunctioning pdfsam:\n# apt-get install python-software-properties\n# add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\n# apt-get update\n# apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\n...and welcome back your lovely pdfsam\n", "Q: Wireless disconnect issues Ubuntu 16.04 with RTL8821ae ** UPDATE 12/03/2016: I still have not solved this issue.

I don't want to recover the remaining files and lose the directories and filenames. \n\nA: If you overwrote a partition, and now want to restore data, and can't mount the disk, you have a problem. First thing to do is not to write to that disk anymore. You can use a utility like Photorec to recover files on that disk. If the partition table is overwritten, which seems to be the case, filenames and file dates are gone. If you have a backup, use that. You might need another disk to write all data to. \nPhotorec can recover probably anything except those 3GB. I've used it with a formatted disk, and was amazed how much I could find back. Since then I encrypt all my disks. \n", "Q: Problem with installing chrome I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04.\nI tried to install Google Chrome by downloading a .deb file from the internet.\nI opened it using Software Center, but I get a message:\n\nThis is 3rd party software and it may have non-free components\n\nMore importantly, it's not installing.\n\nA: To install Chrome, you must be running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu.

So I'm still a complete noob with Ubuntu but while I'm learning to code I just have it running on a VM (version 15.04 64bit), which is great no problems but I want to be able to take it with me. So I've been looking at basic laptops that I can fully install it on and found this that I quite like: http://www.webhallen.com/se-sv/datorer_och_tillbehor/236067-asus_e502sa-dm049t_156_fhd_n3150-4gb-128gb_ssd-intel_hd_graphics-win_10 Would an install on this work? I've read some horror stories where Linux can mess peoples computers up and only work on certain brands. How true is this? Is it as daunting process as it sounds?\nMany thanks guys :)\n\nA: Probably yes,\nLinux packs a almost all drivers into it's kernel but Ubuntu uses mostly older kernels, so new peripherals can also be tricky but this should be a matter of time before any missing drivers get implemented into the kernel.\nNvidea drivers can also be painful to install, they keep their driver information closed, so open source initiatives as nouveau try to back engineer these closed drivers.   \nBefore you install there's always an option to use a live USB running Ubuntu, to see how it goes. This ruins nothing, nor it will leave any traces on your PC !!\nIf you are booting first in windows try \"Rufus\" or \"USBwriter.exe\" for windows to write the Ubuntu ISO to.\nAs a last tip: try to make an image of the Windows which is pre installed on this PC ( example using Clonezilla) . You might need it later. Ubuntu en linux however should install perfectly alongside the existing windows OS. The other way is a bit difficult, but is is possible.  \nIn general there shouldn't be a problem.\n\nA: Computers can never be completely \"messed up\" by a Linux install. Even if Linux won't boot, you'll still be able to boot Windows, and if GRUB doesn't work (highly unlikely) then you'll still be able to repair the Windows bootloader and boot Windows again.\nYou can also test Linux on your computer first by preparing a bootable DVD or flash drive, and if your computer can boot from that then there's a high chance that Linux will work once you've installed it.\nNevertheless I'd recommend a full disk backup (preferably an image) if you're particularly concerned and if you've only got one computer then make sure that you have a reliable way to boot your system in the event that it won't boot from the hard drive.\n", "Q: How do I run any application as root?

The accepted answer there is going to help me a lot. Thank you for your suggestions, criticism, and help, bobbyblackblech, Pilot6, Serg, and Parto.\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with sudo by default. sudo is a package/command that allows you to run any command/application as root (sudo stands for SuperUser Do).\nYour user is by default in sudoers file if you are administrator (who installs the system, per example).\nSimply type:\nsudo <command>\n\nExample:\nsudo gedit\n\nThis runs gedit as root. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH SUDO AND SUPERUSER/ROOT.\n\nA: In addition to sudo, you might also need to disable X access control within your user X session:\nxhost +\nsudo foo\n...\nsudo bar\n\nFor foo and bar being X applications.\nBut I agree with everybody: don't do that!\n", "Q: OpenVPN bridge doesn't work outside LAN I trying setup OpenVPN server.

Ubuntu Xenial os out for a couple of months now. Some Ubuntu Touch devices like the M10 are already running the Xenial base. But e.g. the Aquaris E4.5 are still running Vivid (15.04) base. When will be a switchover? This should by the way be technically possible, right?\n\nA: I believe this thread answers the question. \nOn April 22, 2016 Łukasz Zemczak wrote: \n\nAs already mentioned in a few landing e-mails, the baseline switch\n  from vivid to xenial is our near-term plan for stable channels. But\n  please remember that it's not an easy task. When we were switching our\n  baseline from 14.09 (ubuntu-rtm) to 15.04 long time ago it took us a\n  few months to stabilize the phone again. With xenial introducing the\n  g++ ABI break (and a few other nuances), the whole process could take\n  even longer since there's more things we need to consider during the\n  switch.\nThe most difficult part is that we can't only concentrate on one\n  front, meaning: we can't just drop everything and just work on getting\n  xenial (devel-proposed) into working shape as our current focus needs\n  to be on the stable devices (vivid-overlay). That being said, we will\n  be preparing something similar to a 'task force' that will be taking\n  care of moving the xenial initiative forward. It's really hard to give\n  a firm schedule here - with this we still need to wait a bit.\nAll this means the next few OTAs will still be vivid-based with our\n  development focus on vivid, but then we intend to switch to xenial for\n  future devices.\n\n", "Q: Why is my Ubuntu being slow I am seeing if I like Ubuntu on a virtual computer program.

You can HIDE the grub boot screen (as display it for zero seconds) by installing and using tweaks of grub-customizer.  \nMy advice would be to clean up all the mess (delete all partitions you don't need) and do a fresh install of Ubuntu. After that, install grub-customizer by opening a Terminal window and type: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install grub-customizer. The customizer offers you multiple options to play with.\n", "Q: Disable discrete graphics card permanently Just installed Ubuntu 16.04 in a dual boot with Win 7.

Open a terminal and execute this command : sudo snap install ubuntu-core\nNow you are able to install \"normal\" snap applications, here an example to install nmap:\nsudo snap install nmap ... you can update this snap with : sudo snap refresh nmap \nUpdate with instructions how to download a snap package and install it on an offline computer : First you have to find out the download location of the snap package you want to download. In the example nmapabove it is -> https://launchpad.net/~joetalbott/+snap/nmap/+build/1021.\nTo install it execute : sudo snap install /path-to-the-downloaded-file/filename.snap \nUpdate with an explanation addressing your question how to find various snap packages :\nUnlike the way installing software from repositories, snap packages are designed to work independently on supported Linux systems, so all dependencies are included in each snap.\nAs a consequence there is not a single snap store where all the snap packages are located.  \nEveryone can create snap packages and choose the location where they are stored. What you want is possible but not the way it is supposed to work, in these days nearly everybody has an internet connection and in the case of Ubuntu you should use the standard way, just as you do when installing or updating applications from the repositories ... otherwise you have to search.  \nHere is one location where you can find many snaps to download manually : uApp Explorer.com\nAs snap packages become more popular over time, many developers offer them as a download alternative to .deb files - this is a current example from the notes application : get-notes.com\n\nA: You can download snap by using the snap download command.\nFor example:\nsnap download simplenote\n\nThis will download a .assert and a .snap file to your current directory.\nYou will also need the ubuntu-core package:\nsnap download ubuntu-core\n\nCopy all files to the computer where you want to install, then install like this:\nsnap ack ubuntu-core**.assert\nsnap install ubuntu-core**.snap\nsnap ack simplenote**.assert\nsnap install simplenote**.snap\n\nYou need to install the snapd package on the offline computer. You can download that using apt download snapd (on your internet-connected computer).\nAnd install it using the provided install.sh script:\ncd /path/to/download/folder\nsudo ./install.sh\n\n", "Q: Full install to USB drive (not U.S.B installer) Can you install Ubunta to a USB drive? So it is installed to a USB as you would install it to a hard drive.\n\nA: Yes, you can. You just have to point the Ubuntu installer to the USB drive manually during the installation by choosing \"something else\". (Keep in mind you can't install from a USB stick to itself)\nHOWEVER, I would not recommend it. It will be slow to start up, and may perform excessive writes, eventually causing the USB drive to fail.\nRather, I suggest creating a \"live\" USB stick with \"persistence.\"\n", "Q: How do I set-constraints on a controller?

Note that running virtualenv venv creates a virtualenv named venv for Python 2 by default on Ubuntu if you don't specify the Python version explicitly.\nIn any case, if you want to create a virtualenv for Python 2, run:\nvirtualenv venv  # create virtualenv named venv for Python 2\n\nIf you want to create a virtualenv for Python 3, run:\nvirtualenv venv -p python3  # create virtualenv named venv for Python 3\n\nIn both cases, after you have activated the virtualenv by running source venv/bin/activate, you just need to call pip to install Python packages; this still applies for a virtualenv created for Python 3 because pip already knows what Python version you are using, so don't call pip3.\n\nA: I used dpkg -S <missing file> to figure out which package to reinstall...\nThen I ran (example):\nsudo apt install --reinstall libpython2.7-stdlib libpython2.7-minimal\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 is not detecting my Nvidia 820M graphic card, how should I install the drivers Ubuntu 16.04  is not detecting my Nvidia 820M graphic card, how should I install the drivers ? \nWill I face any problems if I install the drivers?  \n\nA: You say \"does not detect\" but you probably mean \"does not install and configure proprietary drivers\". I suppose it might not detect the hardware at all, but that unlikely. Run \"lspci\", for example, to check.\nIf you need the nvidia drivers, your question was answered here: \nGraphics issues after/while installing Ubuntu 16.04/16.10 with NVIDIA graphics\nAfter installation of nvidia-364, don't worry about Optimus and getting automatic mode switching. Stay away from Bumblebee or other magic. That's a chore for advanced users, and perhaps not even them. Be content with running \"nvidia-settings\" where you can choose to use the nvidia or built-in Intel display, if your computer has both. Then you have to restart and you are stuck with that video card for whole session.\nOn my system, the Intel is more stable, less likely to crash at random and never shows static or pixelated letters.  I have very poor performance of the Nvidia driver to external monitors. Now that X configuration is mostly automatic, it is also now mostly impossible to fix and adjust (old man talking).  Probably, my monitors are not fast enough to keep up with Nvidia. However, with Intel, there are other drawbacks. The cursor is invisible after suspend and you have to switch to VT1 and back to get it to show again. That's really annoying.\n", "Q: How to set a image as background of the gnome terminal?

I am working with an embedded system in my lab and to remotely access the board, I have given a static IP to the board on Ethernet connection. The problem is - due to security reasons Ethernet connection cannot access general internet. The only way to access internet is by using wlan0. By default, Ethernet connection is preferred over wireless.\nIs there a method by which I can remotely access the board using Ethernet? and whenever I run a command which required general internet connection ( such as sudo apt-get update), the board uses wlan0 to access internet!\n\nA: You can assign a different IP address to each network interface or have them assigned by the DHCP server on their respective network (the default if you don't assign an IP manually). You already assigned an IP address to the wired network interface and I would guess that the wireless network has a DHCP server, so you can just leave that at its default configuration.\nYou should now be able to\n\n\n*\n\n*reach the host from both networks through their respective IP addresses (unless an intermediate network component like a firewall blocks such traffic) and\n\n*access the internet through the wireless interface, because the DHCP server should have submitted a gateway address, so the host's networking layer can set up an appropriate route to public internet.\n\n*The wired connection should have no internet access unless you set up a gateway and/or route for it.\nIf you want to restrict inbound SSH traffic to one interface you can configure the SSH server to only listen to connections coming through that interface:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/ssh/sshd_config uncomment or add a ListenAddress entry with the static IP address of that interface, e. g.:\nListenAddress 10.0.23.42\n\nYou can specify ListenAddress if you want to listen to multiple interfaces or IP versions (e. g. in a dual-stack setup with IPv4 and IPv6 on the same interface).\n\n*Restart the SSH server:\nsudo service ssh restart\n\n", "Q: Trying to use squeezelite with existing PulseAudio outputs So I am trying to set up a squeezebox (Logitech media server) client using squeezelite on my Ubuntu 16.04 install, and am having some trouble getting what I want out of it.\nWhat I am trying to achieve\nI want to be able to be playing music on my desktop through my headphones, and be able to open up the sound menu to switch the output to the computer's external speakers.\nWhat is actually happening\nWhen squeezelite is running, the sound menu does not show the built-in audio options (which includes the external speakers which are connected with aux), and sending audio to my computer from the server plays through the external speakers.

I checked yesterday and speed was normal now. I am not sure how that happened but any help for future reference will be appreciated.\n\nA: I have seen this. There are 3 causes I've found. I think most likely the problem is not in your computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*A failing network switch sitting on my desktop. It would occasionally panic and reset itself.  A technician suggested replacement. To my surprise, the problem disappeared after spending $45 on a new one. If you don't have a switch, you may have a wireless router with trouble.\n\n*ISP service problems. You have no way of knowing if the ISP itself is bogged down by heavy traffic among your neighbors.  I work in a university library and the network slows down horribly when 100 students are watching ESPN and soap operas.\n\n*Physical hardware.  Water was getting inside the network cable coming into my home, causing weird, unpredictable stopages. Moisture and temperature caused unpredictable stumbles.  Network did not completely fail, it was fine 9 days out of 10, but then it would slow to a crawl. Repair of a box outside solved that one. Frustrating part there was that the signal never failed completely, but it just got s-l-o-w.\nCan you take your computer to a different network to find out if same problem happens again?  If you can take the computer to another network, and it happens again, then you'll have information.\nI guess you could have a network driver problem. Here is one thing to try. Open a terminal and run \"tail -f /var/log/kern.log\". Let that run as you go about your business. That will show much of same output you see in \"dmesg\", but maybe more specific and you see the new lines.  When the network becomes slow, perhaps messages will start appearing.  If your driver (a kernel module for the network device?) is failing, you'll usually see something there. You may see system disassociating itself with network and re-associating. \n\nA: Out of curiosity, are you sure that you have a sufficient amount of data left? \nLooking at the website, it looks like a paid internet service working on the same network as a phone company. Most of them will throttle your bandwidth after you have used up your limit even if you have a \"unlimited\" plan. \nThese things aren't meant to replace your Internet Provider, just a backup or if you need to check your email while traveling. \nEDIT - \nThis is a link to the website. \nhttps://www.tataphoton.com/en-in/photon-postpaid/loc/Delhi\nit is a data allotment plan, You are most likely running up to your bandwidth allotment. \n", "Q: How to check and clean Ubuntu 16.04 from multiple Apache, Mysql, php installations?

There are old directions for 64-bit here, and some for 32-bit here, but these all assume old paradigms (/proc/acpi/thermalzone instead of the newer /sys/class/thermal—simply replacing the paths doesn't work). The fan never turns on so the system overheats. Acer had a Windows utility that controlled it but this doesn't work on Linux for obvious reasons.

I'm trying to move only a single partition on a 1TB disk, to a 250GB SSD.\nMy current setup:\nsda SSD, GRUB INSTALLED HERE\n--sda1 Windows 10 recovery\n--sda2 Windows 10 OS ~240 GB\n\nsdb Mechanical HDD, 1TB\n--sdb1 Ubuntu 16.04 ~110 GB\n--sdb2 NTFS Storage ~650 GB\n--sdb3 EXT4 ~16GB (used for testing and backups)\n--sdb4 Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 ~120GB\n--sdb5 SWAP\n\nMy new SSD is also 240GB and I got an external case to transfer the OS.  I'm going to swap the 1TB for the SSD, which is smaller, but I only want sdb4 moved.  It will look like this:\nsdb NEW SSD\n--sdb1 Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 ~120GB\n--sdb2 Swap ~8GB\n--sdb3 NTFS Storage ~112GB\n\nThe new sdb3 NTFS will be an empty new partition, I don't want to copy it from the 1TB.\nTo do the transfer, I'll remove my 1TB from my laptop, put in the SSD in its place, and put the 1TB in a external USB case to access it.  I'll boot from a LiveUSB, and then, what?\nFrom what I've read, I can't just do dd from the 1TB to the SSD because it's smaller, and I don't want to copy the entire disk, I only want sdb4 copied over.  Will it copy it over to the new disk as sdb1 or still sdb4?\nAfter I figure out how this is done, I should be able to mount the new SSD and chroot into it to run update-grub right?\nSince the partitions use UUID's, is the new SSD's copied Linux partition going to have a new UUID?  Is this going to cause problems booting/running if it has a new UUID?  On the other hand, if the UUID is also copied over, will this cause problems by having 2 identical UUID's present when I have the USB plugged in?  I would rather not delete sdb4 from the 1TB and will keep it as a backup.  I will also continue to use the 1TB via USB for storage.\nLastly, obviously I'll have to edit my /etc/fstab.\nSorry for all the question, but everything I read from using dd, to gparted and other software all are unclear and do things differently.  And it's unclear if the OS will have problems when its partition identifier has changed (sdb1/4 or new UUID).\n\nA: So I took the plunge since nobody answered and decided to give it a shot, and it worked, in the end.  Here's what I did;\nI plugged my new SSD in via USB.\nOpened gparted and went to my 1TB, right-clicked the Ubuntu install I wanted to copy, and clicked on \"Copy\".  Went to the new SSD, right-clicked the empty drive and \"Paste\".  It took a while but it copied over the entire partition and preserved the UUID.  I did the same thing for the swap partition so that the new one would have the same UUID and I wouldn't even have to make any changes in my /etc/fstab since it uses UUIDs.  I then created a blank NTFS partition that I can share between Ubuntu and Windows.\nOnce that was done I physically swapped the new SSD and the 1TB drive.  Upon booting, I got a device doesn't exist error.\nI booted into a LiveUSB and selected \"Try Ubuntu\".\nThen I opened a terminal and typed out this:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1\n\nWith sdb1 being the new partition that I copied over from my old 1TB, and sda is my Windows drive, which always had grub installed on it.\nRunning the grub-install command above detected Ubuntu's new home on the SSD, and also detected Windows 10.  I didn't even have to do an update-grub command.\nI rebooted the laptop and grub came up with my 2 options of Ubuntu Gnome or Windows 10, and both options work great!  \nMy 1TB is now in the USB case that I used for the SSD originally, just to copy the partition.  It will be used now for long-term storage.  I prefer the speed over the size.\nSide note; Running Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 on the SSD is blazing fast and boots in about 5 seconds to desktop.  Suffice to say I'm quite happy!\n", "Q: Accessing root files by logging in as normal user After logging in as a root from a terminal, I can create new directories but I can neither see nor manually access them by mouse clicking when log in as normal user in GUI.

I switched to Ubuntu this year from Windows. I like Ubuntu, but what I'm missing is smart \"Open with\" dialog. You should manually search for a program either from long list without ability to filter, either from disk and I don't even know where are my programs. This is what Ubuntu provides out of the box. Is there any modification which will allow easy search and pick up a program to open a file in \"open with\" dialog? It should work like when we type in a program name in \"Search your computer\" screen on win key.\n\nA: Script Intro\nThis script allows choosing a file, selecting an application from file selection dialog, open user selected file with that application, and optionally setting that same application as default. \nSince the script uses file dialog , you can select a .desktop file of an application from anywhere in the filesystem. For instance, if you have one in /opt directory, you can easily navigate there. By default , dialog starts out in /usr/share/applications since that's where most applications place their .desktop files.\nThis script is meant to be added to Nautilus as right click option. \nInstallation\nThe script is posted here and on my personal github repository. Simplest way would be via wget command :\n   cd $HOME/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/ && wget -O select_application.py  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SergKolo/sergrep/master/select_application.py  && chmod +x select_application.py\n\nIf you have git installed , you can install it via the following steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*cd /tmp\n\n*git clone https://github.com/SergKolo/sergrep.git\n\n*mv /tmp/sergrep/select_application.py $HOME/.local/share/nautilus/scripts \n\n*chmod +x $HOME/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/select_application.py\nHow it works:\nAfter installation, user can right click on a file\n\nChoosing the select_application.py will bring up the following dialog. ( Note: typing in the initial few letters of a program does allow for auto-focus of specific file. )\n\nChoose the application which you want to open your file. Finally you will be asked to set that application as default or not:\n\nScript source code\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n#\n###########################################################\n# Author: Serg Kolo , contact: 1047481448@qq.com \n# Date: July 11, 2016 \n# Purpose: Alternative \"Open With\" software for Nautilus\n#          filemanager\n# \n# Written for: http://askubuntu.com/q/797571/295286\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\n###########################################################\n# Copyright: Serg Kolo , 2016\n#    \n#     Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software is \n#     hereby granted without fee, provided that  the copyright notice \n#     above and this permission statement appear in all copies.\n#\n#     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \n#     EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF \n#     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\n#     IN NO EVENT SHALL  THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY \n#     CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, \n#     TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE \n#     SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\ndef run_sh(cmd):\n    # run shell commands, return stdout\n    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    out = p.stdout.read().strip()\n    return out \n\ndef extract_command(desktop_file):\n    # read .desktop file , return command it  runs\n    command=\"\"\n    with open(desktop_file) as file:\n        for line in file:\n            if \"Exec=\" in line:\n                for string in  line.split('Exec=')[1].split():\n                    if \"%\" not in string:\n                      command = command + string + \" \"\n                break\n    return  command\n\ndef set_as_default( mime , desk_file  ):\n    # add the .desktop file to list of apps assigned to \n    # mime types in mimeapps.list file\n    # TODO : find out if Nautilus automatically creates this file\n    #        or do we need to ensure that it exists ?\n    defaults_file = '/home/' + getpass.getuser() \\\n                    + '/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list'\n    temp_file = '/tmp/new_files'\n    write_file = open(temp_file,'w')\n\n    defaults_found = False\n    mime_found = False\n    with open(defaults_file) as read_file:\n        for line in read_file:\n            if '[Default Applications]' in line:\n                defaults_found = True\n            if defaults_found and mime in line:\n                write_file.write( mime + '=' + desk_file + \"\\n\" )\n                mime_found = True\n            else:\n                write_file.write( line.strip() + \"\\n\" )\n\n\n    if not mime_found :\n       write_file.write( mime_type + '=' + desktop_file + \"\\n\" )\n\n    write_file.close()\n    os.rename(temp_file,defaults_file) \n\n#--------------\n\ndef main():\n\n    # Open file dialog, let user choose program by its .desktop file\n    filepath = run_sh('zenity --file-selection --file-filter=\"*.desktop\" \\\n                              --filename=\"/usr/share/applications/\" ')\n    if filepath == \"\" :\n       sys.exit(1)\n\n    # Get the program user wants to run\n    program = extract_command(filepath)\n\n    # Find out the mimetype of the file user wants opened\n    mime_type = run_sh(\"file --mime-type \" \\\n                       + sys.argv[1]  ).split(':')[1].strip()\n\n    # Extract just the .desktop filename itself\n    desktop_file = filepath.split('/')[-1]\n\n    # Check if user wants this program as default\n    return_code = subprocess.call( [ 'zenity', '--question', '--title=\"\"',\n                      '--text=\"Would you like to set this app as' + \\\n                       ' default for this filetype?\"'])\n\n    if return_code == 0 :\n       set_as_default( mime_type , desktop_file )\n\n    # Finally, launch the program with file user chose\n    # Can't use run_sh() because it expects stdout\n    proc = subprocess.Popen( \"nohup \" + program + \" \" + sys.argv[1] \\\n                             + \" &> /dev/null &\" , shell=True)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\" :\n    main()\n\n", "Q: How can get Mac Os like column view in Ubuntu 16.04? \nNavigating the folders and sub folders in the same window\nMy question is quite similar to How can I see a folder and a subfolder in the same window? but It is not working for ubuntu 16.04 is there any alternatives ?\nThat image is also from the same URL\nI love the present system of architecture of Ubuntu but I work with many folders opening and navigating taking me more time so I found this kinda feature in mac so ,is one having for ubuntu too?  \nAfter trying the @jadenPete answer it raised the following errors \n\n\nA: The problem is that the PPA is intended for older releases.

I would like to automate e-book build from remote repositories. A command-line tool would be useful in this case. Is there any software for Ubuntu?\n\nA: The software pandoc ( http://pandoc.org/ ) might come in handy for your needs. It can be installed in Ubuntu by opening a terminal (Alt-Ctrl-T) and typing sudo apt install pandoc.\nPandoc can convert between a variety of different formats, including txt,  html, xhtml, doc, docx, odt, epub, fb2, docbook, OPML, LaTeX, pdf, markdown, asciidoc, MediaWiki, Dokuwiki, org-mode, and a variety of others.\nIt does not appear to support conversion to/from mobi or aw3, but could certainly build an epub file from a variety of different sources. Then if you like the epub file it produces, you could use @John1024 's answer to convert to mobi or kindle format.\nBy starting with a source file that supports formatting, such as markdown, html, asciidoc, or the like, you can get a nicely-formatted epub output. The pandoc README file gives a nice overview of the command-line options that are available (including options for table of contents, fonts, link styles, margins, etc). \n\nA: A wide variety of documents can be converted to ebook (epub, mobi, ...) using ebook-convert which is part of the calibre package.\nFor example, as long as input is a supported format, an epub can be created with the command:\nebook-convert  input output.epub\n\nOr, if you use kindles:\nebook-convert  input output.mobi\n\nSome input formats include:  LIT, MOBI, AZW, EPUB, AZW3, FB2, DOCX, HTML, PRC, ODT, RTF, PDB, TXT, PDF.\nIf the input file is a PDF, then one may want to add an option:\nebook-convert --enable-heuristics  input.pdf output.epub\n\nCalibre may be available from your package manager but it often helps to install the latest version which is available here.\nAuthoring a book\nAs an alternative to calibre, OpenOffice/LibreOffice offers an extension, Writer2ePub, to claims to be able to create \"well formatted, easy readable ePub\" files with a single click.\nThe Writer2ePub extension can be downloaded from here.\n", "Q: adobe-flashplugin package is virtual Trying to install flash on Ubuntu Mate 16.04, I went to https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/quantal/adobe-flashplugin/ thinking I could find the package there.\nInstead I got a cryptic message:\n\nWhat does this message mean?\n\nA: It looks to me like you were trying to install the 12.10 Quantal version. That release has been EOL for a very long time now. If you want the Adobe flash plugin for Ubuntu MATE 16.04, the easiest way to do it is:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-addons\n\n\nA: A virtual package allows for a common name to be depended upon by other packages even though several things might provide that service/function.  There's more than one way in the package archive to install Adobe Flash and each package causes the virtual package to appear as installed.  Another example of such is ubuntu-default-settings.\nIn a different tool like Aptitude or Synaptic you'd be able to select the virtual package and choose one of the options that provides for the virtual package.  Frequently flashplugin-installer is what is actually needed these days but other routes are possible.

But when mouse is connected and works, then suspend doesn't work.\nI tried editing the wakeup file and disabling some S3 lines, but after that, when I suspended Ubuntu, it turned off the screen, but the PC was still running, so it seems that isn't the right way to handle it.\nHow can I fix this properly?\n\nA: This problem happens on my Ubuntu system as well.  When it does, log in again, open a terminal, and run\n$ ps aux | grep suspend\n\nIf you have the same problem I do, you will see a failed/hanging suspend process. That's what causes the system to start right again, because the suspend isn't finishing itself. \nIf in the same terminal you try this\n$ sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now\n\nyou will get a refusal from the system, with a message saying something like that's a destructive transaction, that's the system d's way of saying that as long as that suspend process is hung, you aren't shutting down.\nThe only fix I know of is to kill the suspend process\n$ kill -9 nnnnnn\n\nwhere nnnnnn is the number of the hanging suspend process you see in the ps aux output. \nI tried to track discussion of this in forums on the kernel and drivers, but it is pretty tough going.  Some people claim it is being solved by kernel updates, say into the latest 4.6 and 4.8 editions, but I don't see any benefit.  My problem, I'm pretty sure, links back to commercial Nvidia drivers that don't always get out of the way.\n\nA: Had this issue and I struggled to to find the source for a few days. My solution was to first search the log journalctl -b | grep suspend\nI found the following:\nPM: Device 0000:05:00.0 failed to suspend async: error 1\n\nThis line provided the device address that created this issue Than I used lspci to identify the device\n05:00.0 ASmedia usb 3.1\n\nUsing lspci shows the actual names of devices by address and in my case I remember seeing this on my ASRock Bios so I rebooted and disabled support for ASmedia usb 3.1 and my Desktop suspended successfully.\nMy case is unique to me but might help others identify the issue.\n\nA: I was having a similar issue to this one. Apparently, there's a known bug where the bluetooth service is causing Ubuntu to wake up immediately upon suspending https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1774994\nThis was the first link I found when I was googling an answer, which is why I'm posting this solution here.\nThe solution is basically to have a script ran before and after suspending to start and stop the bluetooth service.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Makes sure bluetooth service is not running while suspended.\n\nif [ \"${1}\" == \"pre\" ]; then\n    service bluetooth stop\nelif [ \"${1}\" == \"post\" ]; then\n    service bluetooth start\nfi\n\nSave this script as bluetooth-suspend under /lib/systemd/system-sleep and make sure the script can be executed with chmod +x bluetooth-suspend.\nThat seemed to fix the issue for me.\n\nA: It happened to my computer when I used Microsoft Mouse. Before I had used Logitech mouse, then it worked  just fine. So I switched back to Logitech one, now it works normally again. I put computer on suspend, it stays.  \n\nA: I had the same problem on linux mint. Tried to mess with configuration file  /proc/acpi/wakeup, but that didn't work for me for me. Basically you disable device from waking up the PC completly, which is not what you usually want. You want to be able to use device such as keyboard or mouse to wake up Pc on your command not on its own.\nfinally, the issue solved itself after I switch the usb port i use for keyboard dongle. after that it worked fine, so it might help you too\n", "Q: installer always fails at the start using 64GB SSD hard drive;\nnew pendrive; tested out with no errors using rufus,\nused Yumi to put iso on usb.\nboot to the usb.\nclick the install umbunu~~~Then~~~\ninstaller always fails right at the start of the install.\nI tried 3 different isos:\nubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso \nthen\nubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nthen\nUbuntu 14.04.2 LTS (Trusty Tahr).iso\nthinking that would install and then I could upgrade.\n\nthe errors I get say to clean the lens on my cd writter; but I am using a usb stick LOL.\nand unknown un reportable errors & errors\n\nmy comp runs win7 just fine,\nAMD A4-3400\n64 BIT SUPPORT.\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103955\nbios has EFI boot.\nI installed Ubuntu maverick years ago;never any problem.\ngoogled for an answer and spent 2 days on this; using many attempts.\nany Help would be great.\nI always thought that Linux could install an anything.\n\nA: From the YUMI website:\n\nUsing YUMI to install Linux from USB to a Hard Drive is not yet\n  supported (I'm slowly fixing this).\n\nYou might try Unetbootin instead.\n", "Q: Cannot Install ASUS USB-AC51 Wireless on Ubuntu 16.04 I am at my wit's end.

On my (very) old system however, it adds (on average) appr. 4-5% I reckon, which I did not notice in any way.\nUpdate: It turns out import can resize the image in one step, together with fetching the window image. This means a substantial reduction in processor load. At the same time the refresh time is shorter (3 seconds now), still at lower \"costs\".\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*My starting point was the way OP mentioned he wanted to use the option to keep an eye on a window on another workspace, waiting for either something to finish.\n\n*While literally having an exact (mini) copy of a window on another workspace seems impossible, we can make an image of an existing window with the import -command, once we have the window id. While this both works on minimized windows or windows without focus, there is however one issue: the window needs to be on the current workspace.\n\n*The trick is then to temporarily (while the mini- window is used) make the window \"sticky\" (be virtually available on all workspaces) with wmctrl, but minimized at the same time. \n\n*Since all is done automatically, the difference effectively is none, since also returning to the initial viewport, \"un-\" sticky the original window and un- minimizing it, is done automatically.\n\n\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing the shortcut once: targeted window is made sticky, but minimized\n\n*Pressing it again (presumably on another workspace): a small mini- version of the window appears in the upper left corner, updated once per four seconds.\n\n*Pressing it again: mini- window is closed, the desktop moves to the initial workspace of the window, the window is restored un- sticky and un- minimized.\n\n\nSpecifically for VirtualBox\nWhen the VBox window is in front, it turns out Ubuntu shortcut keys are disabled(!), so the control script needs to be launched in another way. Below a few brief ones.\nOption 1\nI edited the control script. Now only in the case of VirtualBox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click anywhere on the desktop, Then press your shortcut key. After that, simply use the shortcut key to show the window and exit.\nExplanation: The control script was made to exit if the window was of type \"desktop\", since you wouldn't want to minimize the desktop. Now the script first looks for possibly existing VirtualBox windows, to target, if the currently active window is the desktop.\nOption 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the icon below (right- click -> save as), save it as minwinicon.png\n\n\n*Copy the lines below into an empty file, save it as minwin.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Window Spy\nExec=showcase_control \nIcon=/path/to/minwinicon.png\nStartupNotify=false\n\nYou'd need to log out and back in for the launcher to \"find\" the local ~/bin path!\nDrag the icon on to the launcher to use it.\nThe second solution has an important downside: after using it from the launcher, it will keep blinking for a few seconds, waiting for a window to appear. During that, clicking again won't have any effect. That can be solved, as described here, but including that in this answer would really make it too long. If you want to use option two, please look into the link.\n\nA: Something that seems like overkill but totally works for this purpose is Open Broadcaster. In the \"Sources\" list box, click the plus, select \"Window Capture\", then follow the prompts to select the window you're interested in. No point in hitting record; just use the preview. It's available for pretty much any OS, with instructions for Ubuntu here, which I've copied below.\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install obs-studio\n\nIf you feel like it, you can then go into the \"View\" menu and hide all the UI elements.\n", "Q: My terminal went black, cannot see any text, how to reset its color?

After the computer turns on, nothing happens. It's just a black screen, with \"_\" flickering like it's something to write with, but I can't write anything.\nI tried using my usb boot again, this time I pressed F6, as I read somewhere it could make something, so I got to that screen and checked the disc, it said it was okay. So I went on to using the last option, booting the system on the HDD, and it gave me a Boot error.\nE: Checked the memory, nothing is wrong with it. Just some insights, it's a laptop that I'm formatting so I can give it to my mom, it had Windows 7 and although it was pretty slow (too much things installed), it was running perfectly.\nE²: Tried disconnecting and reconnecting the HDD, it didn't work.\nI used the boot drive to \"Try Ubuntu\" and tried accessing my HD from there, it seems fine. Idk what it should look like, but the HD is working at least.\nImage of what's in the HD:\n\nTried making the usb boot with Rufus and Unetbootin, neither worked.\nE³: I tried all the solutions from here.

However after following the guide in the first accepted answer of the linked question, by restoring an alternate superblock, the system is still booting into (initramfs). [NOTE: after using fsck like advised in that answer, I could successfully mount the filesystem and copy stuff from it, and create a folder inside it with sudo rights.]\nAt the beginning, I didn't get any text before the (initramfs) prompt, except for:\nBusyBox v.1.22.1 (Ubuntu 1:1.22.0-15ubuntu1) built-in shell (ash)\nEnter 'help' for a list of build-in commands.\n\nBut now I sometimes get also this:\nGave up waiting for root device. Common problems:\n - Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)\n  - Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)\n  - Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)\n - Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)\nALTER! /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root does not exist. Dropping to a shell!\n\nSo then, given that restoring the superblock didn't work, what options do I have to fix my boot? I imagine I could try to reinstall Ubuntu from LiveCD/LiveUSB but I have to add an aspect which adds extra complexity: my main hard disk partition is encrypted (by using the default Ubuntu way, which I guess is called LUKS).\nIs there a way to fix the boot without reinstalling? Or reinstalling without wiping everything? Should I debug my problem by looking at the boot logs?

I just want to download a new drupal core, make the database and install a new site by drush or graphically without having to also renew the chown and chmod commands everytime? I'm a newbie to servers and have spent hundreds of hours learning but can't find what I'm either doing wrong or just not doing in my server.\nPlease help and thanks for your help.\n\nA: Permissions are generally not propagated by the directory that files are being copied into, rather new permissions are controlled by the user's umask. However when you copy a file from one location to another it's a bit of a special case where the user's umask is essentially ignored and the existing permissions on the file are preserved. Understanding this concept is the key to getting what you want (from here).\nSo when you are copying a new directory to /var/www/html you should use:\ncp --no-preserve=all -r ~/drupal/ /var/www/html/new-drupul/\n\nAnother thing is setting sticky bit on the /var/www/html directory:\nsudo chmod g+s /var/www/html\n\nNow when you create new files within /var/www/html or extract a new drupul there they will inherit their parent owners. you can read more about sticky bit here.\nIf you are interested to read more about permissions of apache and /var/www/html this question will give you all the answers.\n", "Q: Apt-get update failing Hello I am new to ubuntu.

Anyone have a better solution? \n", "Q: Scale volume and/or screen brightness with a logarithmic scale I own an Acer Aspire E5-773G notebook running Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity Desktop.\nWhen I change the volume or screen brightness level (no matter whether using Fn+Arrows or through e.g. the Volume Indicator), the scaling does not seem natural.\nThere is nearly no notable difference between the steps in the upper third of the brightness scale and in the upper fourth of the volume scale. \nOn the other hand, the steps between slider positions in the lower third of the brightness scale and in the lower fourth of the volume scale seem huge. Especially the lowest brightness setting is extremely darker than the second lowest setting (but not off).\nTo me these scales seem technically linear, but as the human senses all operate logarithmically, they seem weird. Is there any method how I can change the scaling of mainly brightness and ideally also volume to a more logarithmic one so that the steps seem more equal?\n\nUpdate:\nThe xbacklight tool does not work on my machine for whatever reason. However, I found two alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dbus: You can use the two commands below to get/set the brightness value as percentage, i.e. integer number in the range 0-100:\nqdbus org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.GetPercentage\nqdbus org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage 42\n\nThe advantage of this is that every user can run it without special privileges. It is less fine-grained though.\n\n*Direct access to /sys/...: You can use these commands to get/set the brightness level as raw integer number in the range of 0-x. The actual maximum value x can be found using the third command:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\necho 42 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\ncat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness\n\nThe advantage of this is that it provides direct access to the hardware capabilities, so this is the most fine-grained control we can get. Unfortunately, changing the brightness value requires root rights (note the sudo in the set-command).\n\nA: That bothered me as well, at least for the brightness adjustment, so I wrote the following script (edit: alternative backlight control commands added in comments):\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncurrent=`xbacklight -get`\n# alternatively, if xbacklight does not work:\n# current=`qdbus org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.GetPercentage`\n\nscale=\"1 2 5 10 20 50 100\"\n\ncase $1 in\n    \"down\")\n        # translate space to newline so tac will reverse order of lines (values)\n        for val in $(tr ' ' '\\n' <<< $scale | tac) ; do\n            # scale = 3 to preserve some decimal values\n            if (( $(bc <<< \"scale=3 ; $val < $current/1.1\") )) ; then\n                newval=$val\n                break\n            fi\n        done\n        ;;\n    \"up\")\n        for val in $scale ; do\n            # scale = 3 to preserve some decimal values\n            if (( $(bc <<< \"scale=3 ; $val > $current*1.1\") )) ; then\n                newval=$val\n                break\n            fi\n        done\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Usage: $0 [up, down]\"\n        exit 1\nesac\n\nif [ \"x$newval\" == \"x\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Already at min/max.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Setting backlight to $newval.\"\n\n    # thanks: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=981217#p981217\n    notify-send \" \" -i notification-display-brightness-low -h int:value:$newval -h string:x-canonical-private-synchronous:brightness &\n\n    xbacklight -set $newval -steps 1 -time 0\n    # alternatively, if xbacklight does not work:\n    # qdbus org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage $newval\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\nIt depends on having xbacklight installed.\nName it brightness.sh, and running brightness.sh up or brightness.sh down will step up or down through the scale specified at the top of the script.  The call to notify-send triggers the on-screen brightness notification (at least in Unity).  (I'm sure the script could be improved some, but it seems to work well enough.)\nI then setup keyboard shortcuts (for my tablet's volume rocker buttons, in my case) to trigger /path/to/brightness.sh up and /path/to/brightness.sh down.\nTo do something similar for volume, you'd need to replace the calls to xbacklight with a command that lets you read/set the volume and change the notification to be a volume notification.\n", "Q: I messed up MySQL.

I have recently started using Linux and I want to create a script that will do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a text file where the first line is: Work Plan {todays date}\n\n*Save it with the name work_plan_{todays date}\n\n*(Optional - not essential like points 1 and 2) Open it full screen height, half screen width.\n\n\nHow can I write a script that will do this and that I can call from any terminal without having to out its full path? That is, I want to just type, for example, gen-work-plan and not /usr/home/document/gen-work-plan...\nDoes anyone know how I can do this?\n\nA: Something like:\n#!/bin/bash\ntoday=$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d\")\necho \"Work Plan $today\" > work_plan_\"$today\"\ngedit work_plan_\"$today\"\n\nDon't forget to make it executable with chmod +x gen-work-plan.\nTo run it without path, either add the directory containing the scrip to your $PATH in ~/.bashrc (recommended for security):\nexport PATH=$PATH:_Location_of_the_file_\n\nOr symlink it in /usr/bin: \nln -s _location_/gen-work-plan /usr/bin/gen-work-plan\n\n\nA: To do exactly what you describe takes a script\n\n\nCouldn't resist posting an answer...\nTo create a file, with the current date as a title and as header inside would take one or two lines.

I was following this tutorial:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mysql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04\nSo far, I installed mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev, and I was suppose to tell MySQL to create its database directory structure where it will store its information using sudo mysql_install_db.\n$ sudo mysql_install_db\n\n[WARNING] mysql_install_db is deprecated. Please consider switching to mysqld --initialize\n[ERROR]   The data directory needs to be specified.\n\nI thought running mysqld --initialize would solve the issue:\n$ mysqld --initialize \n\nmysqld: Can't create directory '/var/lib/mysql/' (Errcode: 17 - File exists)\n[Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated. Please use --explicit_defaults_for_timestamp server option (see documentation for more details).\n[ERROR] Aborting\n\nHow do I tell MySQL to create its database directory structure where it will store its information?\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem using a previously answered question, \nHow to install mysql on Ubuntu 16.04, but I needed to modify the solution to work for me.\nWhen I deleted/moved /var/lib/mysql directory, mysqld --initialize couldn't create the database directory I want in replacement for /var/lib/mysql , and it gave me Errcode: 13 - Permission denied even though I preceded it with sudo. \nI deleted/moved the content of /var/lib/mysql/, but not the directory itself. I tried again to run sudo mysql --initialize, and it worked, and created new content within the /var/lib/mysql/ directory. The content produced by mysql --initialize is different than the previous content I deleted/moved.\nI continued the rest of the steps in the tutorial, and worked perfectly. \nP.S. I needed to use sudo -i to access /var/lib/mysql.\n\nA: This is the entire solution for your problem.\nAccording to fromdual, the suggestion is to just follow the\nadvice of the error. Some functionality is being deprecated.\n\nOur advice is to enable the variable explicit_defaults_for_timestamp\nnow on your testing systems so you can see if your application behave\nwell and then you are prepared for the next release when this feature\nwill become the default.\nIn short term this warning is NOT dangerous. In the long term you\nhave to be prepared for the deprecated functionality. You get rid of\nthe warning my setting explicit_defaults_for_timestamp = 1 in your\nmy.cnf [mysqld] section.\n\nYou can find the my.cnf file in the following locations, and in\nthis order the values override each other:\n\n*\n\n*/etc/my.cnf\n\n*/etc/mysql/my.cnf\n\n*$MYSQL_HOME/my.cnf\n\n*[datadir]/my.cnf\n\n*~/.my.cnf\n\nYou can also find your file by\nfind / -name my.cnf\n\nI added the following in /etc/mysql/my.cnf\n[mysqld]\nexplicit_defaults_for_timestamp = 1\n\nNow try\nmysqld --initialize\n\nAnd I got a reduced error without Timestamp stuff\nmysqld: Can't create directory '/var/lib/mysql/' (Errcode: 17 - File exists)\n2018-11-12T20:13:45.024116Z 0 [ERROR] Aborting\n\nIs this good? Not sure so I look deeper. According to the aboveaccepted stack\nanswer for the error you need to\nsudo -i #log into root\ncd /var/lib/mysql\nrm -r *\n\nsu username  # get back to the original user\n\nmysqld --initialize \n\nThis, still gave me the exact same error. No change!\nmysqld: Can't create directory '/var/lib/mysql/' (Errcode: 17 - File exists)\n2018-11-12T20:13:45.024116Z 0 [ERROR] Aborting\n\nI am not sure the above accepted answer helped at all with the removing the\n/var/lib/mysql, but sudo helped:\nsudo mysqld --initialize\n\nworked...

Yesterday, I was trying to install Teamviewer, but I was not able because apparently it depended \"on libgcc1\".

Unfortunately, it seems that the installation of this program messed up with the configuration of the system, as when I turned on the computer again, I was able to access the GRUB prompt but the screen would go black afterwards. After some analysis, I realised it was due to the fact that \"Starting LightDM Display Manager\" was failing, and thus the GUI was not starting. Does anyone know how to fix the issue?

By default, do not follow symbolic\n       links in the source unless used together with the ‘--link’ (‘-l’)\n       option; see the ‘--archive’ (‘-a’), ‘-d’, ‘--dereference’ (‘-L’),\n       ‘--no-dereference’ (‘-P’), and ‘-H’ options.\n‘-d’\n       Copy symbolic links as symbolic links rather than copying the files\n       that they point to, and preserve hard links between source files in\n       the copies.  Equivalent to ‘--no-dereference --preserve=links’.\n\n\nA: In many command line utilities, single-letter options can be written together.

Could I have some advice please.\n\nA: If python2 and python3 are both installed, and pip for both has been installed,  then there should be a separate pip2 and pip3 command that you can use, for the corresponding version of python.\nNote: you have to explicitly install both pip versions:  apt-get install python-pip for python2, and apt-get install python3-pip for python3.\nAlternatively (but still requiring apt-get install of pip), you can use the pip module from your python executable directly, if you have Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), or Python 3.4+.\nFor example, on Ubuntu 16.04, after installing/upgrading python2 and python3 and both pip versions:\n$ pip --version \npip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)\n\n$ pip3 --version \npip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.5)\n\n$ python2 -m pip --version \npip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)\n\n$ python3 -m pip --version \npip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.5)\n\n", "Q: Free codecs: How to use FFmpeg to convert my mp4s to ogv under Xenial?

Question: Is an application written in JavaScript (A language that Ubuntu recommends) a native or a web one?\nAnswer: According to Ubuntu SDK, Javascript/HTML/CSS apps are considered to be Native because they have unrestricted access to platform's APIs.\nA web app is just a converted website into an app and doesn't have full access to APIs\n\nA: Qt and QML applications would be considered Native, generally because they use C++ as a framework, thus requiring compiling for your platform. Not to mention that Unity8 is being written in Qt, and the Ubuntu SDK is a plugin enriched version of QtCreator.\nHTML5 and by extension, Javascript are going to be associated with being a web application.\n\nA: Calling an app native or web doesnt depend on the language used to make it , you can use C,C++,Python to write web apps using the CGI module as well as use them to write native apps which can fully use the harware of the pc. Normally web app runs on a server thus allowing someone to run a power consuming app on light notebook and still not burn it.For detailed comparison you can peek here.\nCheers\n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu 16.04 when I install Ubuntu with a USB-disk, following message occurred:  \ntask swapper/0:1 blocked for more than 120 seconds.\n\nAnd my computer have an CPU of core-i7-4710MQ and 12 GB memory.\nBut, if I install Ubuntu on a very old computer, I can success.It is a double core Intel CPU with a 2 GB memory.\nThe SSD I used on both computer is the same one.

From the link:\n\nRequirements\nThe following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /var.\n\nDirectory   Description\ncache   Application cache data\nlib     Variable state information\nlocal   Variable data for /usr/local\nlock    Lock files\nlog     Log files and directories\nopt     Variable data for /opt\nrun     Data relevant to running processes\nspool   Application spool data\ntmp     Temporary files preserved between system reboots\n\n\nSeveral directories are `reserved' in the sense that they must not be used arbitrarily by some new application, since they would conflict with historical and/or local practice. They are:\n\n    /var/backups\n    /var/cron\n    /var/msgs\n    /var/preserve\n\n\nApache uses /var/www/html/ and creates it on installation, if it does not exists. Other webservers probably have other locations. Nginx since Ubuntu 15.10 uses this directory as well, but you can also configure it in any Nginx version to use a different directory with the root directive in a site config file (but beware the pitfalls that can happen with this).\nIf you expect a /var/www/ I would assume you need to install apache (or a lamp-server package).\n\nOtherwise ...\nsudo mkdir /var/www/\nsudo chmod 755 /var/www\nsudo chown root:root /var/www\n\nto create it as apache would create it.\n\nA: The /var/www folder does not have to be there by default, as shown by my install:\nphp :: /var » k\ntotal 72\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root  root 4096 12 Jul   06:25   backups\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 root  root 4096 22 Jun   00:01   cache\ndrwxr-xr-x 36 root  root 4096 29 Jun   22:56   lib\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root staff 4096 14 Mar   10:46   local\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    9 12 Jun   02:32   lock -> /run/lock\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 root  root 4096 12 Jul   06:25   log\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root  mail 4096 21 Jun   23:56   mail\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root  root 4096 12 Jun   02:32   opt\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root    4 12 Jun   02:32   run -> /run\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 root  root 4096 12 Jun   03:06   spool\ndrwxrwxrwt  2 root  root 4096 12 Jun   02:38   tmp\n\nSimply create the folder with sudo mkdir /var/www.\n", "Q: Matlab crashes on start \"segmentation violation\" I just installed Matlab on my Ubuntu 16.04.

If your script is named myPythonScript.py, you can run:\npkill -f myPythonScript.py\n\nNote that that command will kill all running instances of myPythonScript.py. It will also kill any other process whose full commandline includes the string myPythonScript.py so, for example, it would kill your editor if you had launched it with something like emacs myPythonScript.py. \nTo be sure you kill only the running script, you can try matching the command more specifically:\npkill -f \"/python.*myPythonScript.py\"\n\nThat will only kill processes matching /python, 0 or more characters and the name of the script. Since the script will look like this in the list of processes:\nterdon 20559  0.0  0.0  22768  7404 pts/4    S+   18:18   0:00 /bin/python /home/chapplec/scripts/myPythonScript.py\n\nThat should kill only running instances of the script. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 not working on my new PC, Intel i5-6600 Skylake with Nvidia GTX 970 I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 before on my laptop and I'm trying to dual boot my new PC with Windows and Ubuntu.

For example in VLC it should be possible by the keys [ and ] . I checked that for Rhytmbox there is also a plugin called RBPitch in case you decide not to install other applications.

I have Tomcat 7 on Ubuntu 14.04. Last week I installed the Ubuntu security updates through apt-get, as I always do, and it upgraded Tomcat to version 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.6 (not sure what the previous version was, most likely 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.5 since I update on a regular basis). Ever since that upgrade, session persistence is broken in Tomcat, meaning that all user sessions get killed when I restart Tomcat or the webapp.\nThis used to work fine. So I tried downgrading the Tomcat packages. I didn't find a way to downgrade to \"7.0.52-1ubuntu0.5\" so I downgraded to \"7.0.52-1\" instead:\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7=7.0.52-1\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7-admin=7.0.52-1\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7-common=7.0.52-1\nsudo apt-get install libtomcat7-java=7.0.52-1\n\nAs soon as I did this, session persistence started to work again. I tried this on a different computer and the result was the same. I tried upgrading again and the problem was back. So there really seem to be something in this update that breaks session persistence.\nI tried it after each step while downgrading the 4 packages listed above, and it only started to work after the last step was done, so maybe the problem is with the libtomcat7-java package.\nAny idea how to fix this without having to downgrade the packages? Where should I look next? Should I open a bug with Ubuntu? Or with Tomcat?\n\nA: I think this might be working in Tomcat 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.7 now. I don't see anything relevant to the issue in the changelog (unless it has something to do with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tomcat7/+bug/1609819). But this new version is working for me. Give it a try.\n", "Q: Installation 16.04 When I download https://mirrors.nl.eu.kernel.org/ubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso and create a bootable USB-thumbdrive, installation fails. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even start but I get an error\n\"Missing parameter in configuration file\nUnknown keyword in configuration file\"\nI have no clue what to do next. Who can put me on a track to get it installed?\n\nA: Sadly, Starup Disk Creator on older releases usually does not work on newer ISOs.  Even the 14.04 version cannot create a 16,04 USB.  The easy workaround is to use dd, although mkusb offers some additional safely checks to avoid common errors like overwriting the system partition. See the link mkusb help page \n\nFurther down the page, you can download mkusb directly (maybe an older version) at mkusb download  Dont forget, dd works just fine, as long as you know which disk you are writing to!  Even the 16.04 Startup Disk Creator uses dd -- too bad, since it no longer gives you the option of having persistence.\n\nA: If you have a very old version of Ubuntu (or some other old linux distro), you can use mkusb-bas, which runs in text mode, but the basic feature is the same as in standard mkusb: it 'wraps a safety belt around dd' to help you select the correct target drive (and avoid overwriting valuable files in other drives).\nSee the following link where you find a basic mode quick start manual and the program itself (a bash shellscript),\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb/v7#mkusb version 7.4.x - mkusb-bas\n", "Q: Is there any tool to convert pdf to ppt/odp slides in Linux/ Ubuntu offline? I am looking for a tool that converts PDF into PPT files or supports any tweak to import PDF files into LibreOffice-impress, LibreOffice-Draw imports the PDF but that does not do the job. So far I am trying to use a workaround called pdftk+pdfchain to burst the pages of the PDF file into single page PDF files and then converting the single page PDF files into images using ImageMagic and importing them into a PPT slide.\n\nA: Here's my take on it from personal experience.  It's a two-step process - convert the PDF into single jpegs, then import the jpegs into LibreOffice Impress.  It works best if the pages in the PDF are landscape already.\n1.)  Make sure the package imagemagick is installed (apt install imagemagick).  Put your source PDF into a directory.  Then in the terminal, navigate to that directory and run: \nconvert filename.pdf filename.jpg \nThis will spit out a jpeg of each page in the PDF.  Move the PDF out of the directory to make step 2 easier.\n2.)  Open Impress.  Go to Slide menu, Slide Layout -> Blank.  This will remove the \"Click to add title\" and stuff.  Then go to Insert -> Media -> Photo Album.  Click add.  Navigate to the directory with all your jpegs.  Select all the jpegs (if you removed the PDF from the directory in step 1, just press CTRL + A to select all of them).  Click Open.  The next options depend on what the pages in the original PDF looked like - if they were landscape, you can probably choose Fill Screen, but you'll have to see what works best for your case.\n\nA: Works in LibreOffice ver. 4.3.3.2\nIdea gleaned from this post.\nOpen a new instance of LibreOffice Impress. Hit Ctrl-o (to commence the process of opening a file). In the ensuing Open window, go to the File type drop-down menu and select PDF – Portable Document Format (Impress) (*.pdf). Then, select your PDF file of choice.\nSaid PDF file should then load into Impress. You can now save the presentation in whatever format is available...but, be sure to check the finished product if saving in a PowerPoint format, as the slides MAY get corrupted along the way.\n\nA: Yes, there are several ways to convert pdf to ppt: online converting services, OmniFormat (very old software), etc.  \nBest solution i've used so many times is Able2Extract : http://www.investintech.com/products/desktop/able2extract/convertpdftopowerpoint/. Unfortunately it's proprietary software. You get free trial for like 7 days. But it's the best by far, for both Windows AND linux.\n", "Q: disk space issues on Amazon Ubuntu?

You can fix it by typing chmod u+w $HOME.\nNotice that the files and directories you created using sudo are probably owned by root now, so, you will need to fix ownership on these.

There were several issues I faced while upgrading.\nWhile updating there were some errors that came up but it was still upgrading. After some time I had a option of Y or N, I chose N for the default version. \nIt turned out to be 16.04, after I had to shut down my computer myself, because it did not restart, as it should after upgrading.\nSecondly after the login page came, there began a loop, which had a black screen occurring every time I entered my password.

Frankly, they are quite irritating.\nPlease answer, it wold be really nice so that I can decide to upgrade or not, and continue using Ubuntu.\n\nA: In case something bad happens next time, you can almost always drop into \"text mode\" by pressing Ctrl + Shift + F1 (or F2 or F3 or F4). It can take a second, so don't be too hasty. Mostly you can go back to your graphical session using Ctrl + Shift + F7 if it is working. You can fix most things in that simple terminal then. For tabs in the terminal, I use tmux and for very simple, text based browsing w3m or lynx (just as a tip), so make sure, you have them installed.\nIn your case, I would wait for the 16.04.1 release, since the initial bugs, like for specific hardware and upgrade circumstances, get fixed there.

I have a HP 255 G3 (specs can be found here) And I can't decide what Ubuntu flavor to install into it, vanilla, Gnome or Lubuntu, because I don't know the core differences in them. (The DE differences are clear, but I'm not certain if it's the only thing that affects performance or battery life, or are there some deeper changes.) Battery life and performance are important, but they can be sacrificed, if stuff will work more smoothly. I've used all of them and that's why this is so hard.\nHere's my pros and con's on every platform:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: The laptop will be a school / coding platform, so pure Ubuntu\nwould be nice to use, so I can be certain that stuff I need will work\non it (Apps that I use in school and libraries I use to compile) BUT\nI don't really like the unity environment and pure Ubuntu isn't the\nbest with battery nor performance.\n\n*Gnome: I like the desktop, a lot...

I've used it a\nlot in the past, but I don't know if it'll work with the apps I need\nto use or the code I'm compiling.\n\n\nOf course, mixing would be great, but I don't know where the effects start or end. Optimally I would end up with Gnomes desktop installed on top of Lubuntu / Ubuntu.\nI thought, this might actually be important:\nThe code I'm trying to compile >at the moment< is busybox, but getting that to work should be on a different question, I think ;)\nThe apps I need to work are libre office (which isn't hard) and some weird programs from the school, that I don't have access to. They've only told me that they can be used on Ubuntu, but I don't know if they'll work right on different flavors.\n\nA: Plain vanilla Ubuntu will run just fine on that machine.  Battery and performance are at least as good as with Ubuntu Gnome (despite what you may have read in a forum on the Internet).\nOnce you're used to Unity you'll find the 1990s-style desktop UIs are clunky and hard to use.\n\nA: Ubuntu GNOME is my choice, definetly works with your specs as far as performance and battery is no problem.\nTry it, does worth it and you get nautilus instead of unity and ubuntu GNOME is very efficient take a look:\nUbuntu Gnome tweaks\n", "Q: Lots of kernels not being removed by Bikeshed I've got an Azure based Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server I ran purge-old-kernels (bikeshed) and it said just 1 kernel was eligible for removal.

too. So I took the numbers in /boot manually into my command:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove linux-image-3.13.0-{24,85,{88..96}}-generic linux-headers-3.13.0-{24,85,{88..96}}-generic\n\nBut your dpkg listing shows mostly \"rc\" which are deleted kernels. But their configuration is kept. This is normally good but not on (so many) kernels. It happens when you use autoremove without --purge.\nYou could remove them afterwards with the above command (without headers if deinstalled yet) and the corresponding numbers. But it is not so important to do that. But the headers take very much space and file inodes, too.\n\nA: All kernels marked rc are not installed.\nI see no problems. Two  kernels 3.13.0-91 and 3.13.0-88 are installed.\n", "Q: Can't stop mirroring in dual monitor setup I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3 64-bit, and have two Dell 17\" monitors connected at a single VGA port.

This changes the detected display from \"Unknown\" to \"Dell 17\". I also tried connecting the second monitor at the DVI port, but that alters my primary monitor display, I lose the mouse, and have no way to operate properly. What hardware setup is ideal for dual monitors? How do I solve this problem? I appreciate your feedback.\nThanks,\nAnjy\n\nA: Two monitors on a single VGA port?  That's kind of like putting two lightbulbs in a single socket and expecting them to blink on and off separately.\nOutside of certain DisplayPort configurations, each monitor has to be on a separate physical port, especially of that port is an analog connection like VGA.\nOne monitor on VGA and one on DVI should work, depending on your video card, one one on DVI and one on HDMI.\nChanging the configuration and losing the mouse sounds more like a display configuration issue unrelated to hardware.  You may need to go in to your display configuration panel and change things.\n", "Q: After restoring minimized window it stays inactive (16.04 LTS) Weird problem - probably something to do with Compiz and its plugins. \nHappens when I minimize a window, and restore it to its previous state by either clicking on the icon in the launcher.

In general libnss-ldapd is\n  simpler but newer and libnss-ldap is more mature but more complex.\n  Also libnss-ldap has some known issues with serving host information\n  and lookups during boot which should be addressed in libnss-ldapd. In\n  addition, libnss-ldap breaks setuid programs (su, sudo) when using\n  LDAP+SSL\n\n\nA: A way to prevent this problem is to make sure the nss_initgroups_ignoreusers parameter - in /etc/ldap.conf (or /etc/libnss-ldap.conf, depending on your system) - is populated with all the (local) users in /etc/passwd:\nNSS_IGNOREUSERS=\"$(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | sort | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's|,$||')\"\nsed -i \"s|^nss_initgroups_ignoreusers.*|nss_initgroups_ignoreusers ${NSS_IGNOREUSERS}|\" /etc/ldap.conf\n\nThis way, when the system boots and users/groups name services are queried to start the local services, no more 'nss_ldap: Can't contact LDAP server' will be issued (since the corresponding local user/group are ignored by NSS LDAP).\n(this issue has been around for years, independently from systemd)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 distorted loading image and Graphic after unlock I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTE on my Sony Vaio Laptop having below configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ram: 4GB\n\n*Graphic Card: AMD Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series [1024 MB]\n\n*Processor: Intel i5-3230M @2.60GHz\n\n\nUbuntu is installed successfully.

The list of object files may include archives.\nWhen would one use this command and for what purpose? \n\nA: Symbol is just a name of a function/variable and the address of its entry point in the object file, archive (archive means static library), shared library or executable.\nExecutables don't need symbols, because usually nothing links to them.\nThe modules (plugins) may not need symbols. They are the libraries that, when loaded, execute a startup code that calls into application to give it pointers to callback function and data. But application don't call the functions from that plugin by name, so no need for symbols.\nstrip has an option to strip only debug information.

I don't really want to password at boot just the log in password.  how do I disable it\n\nA: From your description you opted for full disk encryption.\nUnless you are a total Linux guru, you'll just have to re-install Ubuntu.\nEven for a Linux guru it would be a pain in the neck.\n\nUPDATE:\nHere's a workaround from @Alcuin in the comments:\n\nJust set your user account to auto-login. That way you still only have\nto enter one password at startup while keeping your disk fully\nencrypted.\n\n\n\nIf Ubuntu asks for an encryption passphrase during boot (i.e. on the\ntext console before the login screen is displayed), this indicates\nthat a full disk encryption method was used. (There's more than one\nway to do this, but I'll keep the answer general.) The encryption is\nhandled by an extra software layer between the file system and the\nphysical hard drive, not the file system itself.\nThere is no simple method or tool to undo this. With some knowledge\nabout how Linux systems work, it can be done. You'd have to move the\nwhole file system (or all files) to another partition (with enough\nfree space) or external HDD. Then, remove the encrypted container, and\nrecreate the file system without encryption. Finally, make sure that\nthe new file system is properly recognized by the boot loader and\nmount -a before rebooting.\nIf possible, it's best to avoid this time consuming and error-prone\nprocedure. Just do a fresh install. For a new users, this is the\nquickest and safest option.\n\nThe above quote was taken from here.\n", "Q: How to kill a daemon process in linux?

After this I used kill -9 pid to kill those processes.\n\nA: This can be done in many ways. You can check the process using \ntop\n\ncommand or you can use\nps aux | grep a.out\n\nThis command will show you all the process running (even the zombie processes)\nYou can use kill -9 pid which will kill the process signal. But a better way is to use \nkill -11 pid\n\nThe above approach will create core dump files which are helpful for troubleshooting at later stage.\n\nA: You can use killall executable-name. It kills all instances of the given program and you don't have to check it's PID to kill it.\n", "Q: How to solve \"cannot get hardware address\" error , Ubuntu 16.04 32 bit I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04.

I have been at it for quite some time now and I think that I need help. I believe that it is an issue of the Ubuntu machine not listening on a port.\nI followed the guide at http://www.tweaking4all.com/software/linux-software/use-xrdp-remote-access-ubuntu-14-04/.\nHowever, when I go to rdp from windows, I am able to connect and type in username and password but when I do, I get the following error:\nConnecting to sesman IP 127.0.0.1 port 3350\nsesman connect ok\nsending login info to session manager, please wait...\nsrdp_mm_process_login_response:login successful for display\nstarted connecting\nconnecting to 127.0.0.1 5910\nerror-problem connecting\n\nCould the issue be that my Ubuntu machine is not listening to port 5910?

When I run this command: sudo netstat -peant | grep \"127.0.0.1\" and I scroll through, I do not see anything connected to port 5910. I believe that i have found a large issue. My question now is how do I set up xrdp to listen to port 5910?\n\nA: It's not worth it - there is a better & less painful solution: \nX11VNC\nI spent at least 8 hours fighting the battle to connect from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 16 via xrpd and Windows rdp. I tried endless \"solutions\" that I found posted all over the web.  I made progress, but never managed to fully solve it.  Even if I had, though, it seems that this is weak setup anyway, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't use the Unity Desktop, so your rdp has connect you to a completely different OS UI than what you would use as the Ubuntu standard.\n\n*You can't be logged on already with that account.  So if you were have a scenerio where sometimes you work directly on the Ubuntu machine, and sometimes you connect remotely, you'd have to be sure to log out to allow for that remote connection.\n\n*From what've read, once you have this, you have also fight a battle to get a \"re-connection\" mechanism working to re-enter an rdp session you left.\n\n*You have to manually enter credentials every time you log on.  There is no way to save them on the client end and just connect instantly.\n\n\nI've used a pile of different remote connection interfaces, and overall nothing beats the ease and quality of Windows RDP yet to my mind.  A such, I was pretty fixated on using that.  After fighting this long enough though, and finally throwing in the towel, I found that VNC pretty much works just as well in this context.  \nAs I said initially, on the Ubuntu side I used \"x11vnc\".  Refer to these directions for details on getting that fully setup:\nHow to setup x11vnc to access with graphical login screen?\nOn the Windows side, I used RealVNC Viewer: https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/, which I already had installed and setup for a remote connection to a Mac on my LAN as well.\nWith this setup, I have NONE of the weaknesses outlined above. Further, in full screen mode, the display is just as good as it would be naturally.  I see 0 lag, 0 blurring.  I have a bi-directional clipboard working without any effort to get that...\nIn theory, you are supposed to be able to stack xrpd and x11vnc.  See: http://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=5956\nI tried that too, just to see if I could get it to work.  I had no luck with that either.  So I just said the hell with xrpd in the end, uninstalled it, and rolled back all the changes I made to my machine fighting with it (or least so of them).\nUnless you have a major reason that you NEED RDP instead of VNC, I strongly recommend going this route I've described instead.\n\nA: Ok, so i found the command that will solve my issue. Run this command to remove the error\nRun gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n\nA: This post helped me get rid of the issue.

And I used Xorg.\n\nA: I struggled some days in this problem (Windows 7 Remote Desktop Connection - XRDP CentOS), and by searching I found that the simplest solution for error - problem connecting is clear \"mydomain\\username\" login: before installing packages, kill processes or remove temporary files, just try to connect writing your username only in the XRDP request, so do not save it previously in the Windows 7 Remote Desktop Connection.\nIf you are not allowed to clear your username (XRDP always showing a name by default), clear the RDP connection history for the server you are trying to connect, or take this as an opportunity to clear all connection history, this way (Windows side - CMD):\n@echo off\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default\" /va /f\nreg delete \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\" /f\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\"\ncd %userprofile%\\documents\\\nattrib Default.rdp -s -h\ndel Default.rdp\n\nAnd then try again to connect. If it doesn't work, you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep in mind you should use High Color (16 bits) or higher in Windows RDP; or\n\n*Access xrdp-sesman.log by PuTTY (cat /var/log/xrdp-sesman.log), what will problably show \"X server for display 10 startup timeout (...) another Xserver is already active on display 10\", then vncserver -geometry 1024x768 :10 will show there is a temporary file you can clear, so remove the correct temporary files as explained here and here; or\n\n*Downgrade Tiger VNC.\n\nA: I am very new and I have read bugs and docs regarding this.\nAll I did to fix this issue was to stop and start xrdp, using these commands:\nsudo service xrdp stop\n\nsudo service xrdp start\n\n\nA: I found this one really worked for me.\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1314336\nI summarize here the solution:\n\nI had to remove xrdp, vnc4server, tightvnc, which were all installed in the wrong order. I had to install tightvncserver, then install xrdp.\n\nsudo apt-get remove xrdp vnc4server tightvncserver\nsudo apt-get install tightvncserver\nsudo apt-get install xrdp\n\nThen restart the xrdp service:\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\n\nA: Just change: \n/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini\nAllowRootLogin=1\n", "Q: Attempted to Repair GRUB through live USB.

My computer also has an internal Windows 10 HDD (sda).\nWhen at the partitioning stage, I chose for the boot loader to be installed onto the external HDD (sdb).\nWhen Uniquity is installing the system, it mounts Windows 10's ESP (sda2) and copies the Ubuntu/grub boot loaders over, when it should have mounted the ESP created on the external HDD (sdb1). /dev/sda2 is the Win10 ESP and it's mounted to /target/boot/efi. /dev/sdb1 is the correct ESP but is not touched.\nHere's lsblk:\n\nBecause the boot information is not on the external HDD, the Windows 10 disk must be present to boot Ubuntu because the boot information pointing to Ubuntu is located on the Windows ESP - not exactly optimal.\nThe question is can I force Ubiquity to use sdb1 as the ESP. It makes sense to by default because it's where I chose to install grub but apparently not.\nUbiquity is version 2.21.63.\nI'm revisiting this issue because I need Ubuntu on this computer. I filed a bug report originally but it is still undecided/unassigned.\n\nA: Two other workarounds occur to me, in addition to the one provided by Brady Dean:\nWorkaround 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Before running the installer, change the GPT type code of the EFI System Partition (ESP) you do not want to use to something other than the code for an ESP. Details of how to do this depend on the partitioning software you use:\n\n\n*\n\n*In gdisk, sgdisk, or cgdisk, this would mean changing it from EF00 to just about anything else. (0700 will make it visible as a normal FAT partition to Windows.)\n\n*In GParted or parted, remove the \"boot flag\" from the ESP.\n\n\n*Run the installation. With luck, it won't flake out and insist on finding an ESP on /dev/sda, but will instead notice the one on /dev/sdb and proceed normally.\n\n*After installing Ubuntu, reverse step #1 -- restore the normal \"ESP\" type code to the ESP on /dev/sda. Forgetting this step may have few or no negative consequences, but depending on the type code you use, Windows may start showing it as a regular partition; and if you need to re-install Windows (or some other OS), it may be important that the type code be correct.\n\n\nNote that I've never tried this approach, so I can't guarantee it will work. If it doesn't work, then that information should be added to the bug report referenced in the question.\nWorkaround 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b. The installer program should launch, but it will do so in a way that will cause GRUB to not be installed.\n\n*Finish the installation normally.\n\n*When you're done, Ubuntu will be installed, but won't be bootable. There are a number of ways to make it bootable. The two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd -- This tool, which I maintain, is an alternative to GRUB. You can get a USB flash drive version from its downloads page and use that to boot Ubuntu the first time. You can then edit /etc/fstab to identify the ESP you want to use, mount it at /boot/efi, and install either rEFInd (via a Debian package or PPA) or the regular grub-efi package.\n\n*Boot Repair -- This popular tool, described in more detail here, can install GRUB. I'm not sure offhand, though, how to tell it to use an ESP on /dev/sdb rather than one on /dev/sda. You might need to use type code trickery, as in the preceding workaround; or perhaps just setting up /etc/fstab, as with rEFInd, would do the trick.\n\n\n\nI frequently use the ubiquity -b method of installing on computers that multi-boot many distributions, since managing GRUB in such cases is a bit awkward at best and totally unworkable at worst; rEFInd does a much better job with such installations. Of course, this is a somewhat different problem than that of getting all your stuff installed on /dev/sdb rather than /dev/sda, but the same solution should work.\n\nA: Well I didn't find a solution, but I found a workaround. \n\n\n*\n\n*After booting the live cd, run dmesg | grep ata to find the id for the internal drive. In my case it was ata1.00\n\n*Reboot the live cd but hit e to edit the grub configuration\n\n*Add libata.force=1.00:disable to the end of linux. 1.00 comes from ata1.00\n\n*Hit f10 and the machine should boot and Linux should not see the drive - check with lsblk\n\n*Continue installation, Ubuntu sees the external as /dev/sda\nI would also recommend adding this to the installed system's grub configuration so it doesn't even see the internal drive. Don't want anything happening to it.\nThanks to https://askubuntu.com/a/387261/440238 for the libata.force=1.00:disable part.\n", "Q: Ubuntu GNOME boots to grey screen with border I have just finished installing Ubuntu GNOME version 16.04 and when I boot (UEFI) I am presented with a grey screen with a darker grey border.

You only need to be in the sudoers group to have root privileges via sudo on the default settings.\nA partial workaround would be to configure sudo to allow you to sudo for just the apt-get command but this is insecure and may not completely work. \nYou could ask for an account to be used just for installing, this would then not be used for running services or scripts, this is marginally less risky for the admin but could be secured more heavily because of its particular focus.\nThis simplest workaround here is to use docker or a virtual machine (assuming its subsystem is already installed, as that will require sudo) to create a slice that you can administer without root. \nThere is a guide here for docker - https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#docker\nUltimately you will be struggling to make this work without root so just go get root or get another box.\nA fundamental rule in the unix world is that you must be running as root to serve data on a port numbered less than 1024, this will prevent you from serving on most of the standard ports.\n", "Q: freezing and getting this on every boot: kernel: intel_soc_dts_thermal: request_threaded_irq ret -22 I use Ubuntu 16 alongside win 10 on lenovo g50-70 (intel chipset)\nI get this line on every boot, \nkernel: intel_soc_dts_thermal: request_threaded_irq ret -22,\n\nI was wondering if this is related to the freezing of my Ubuntu. \nIt has been freezing from the day I installed it but I installed liquorix  kernel and it froze rarely.\nEvery time it freezes, I get a 'clearing orphaned inode' message at boot \nBut I can still use Ubuntu without any problem\n\nA: The error: \"kernel: intel_soc_dts_thermal: request_threaded_irq ret -22\" comes from the Intel SoC DTS Thermal driver.  It requests a threaded irq handler and for some reason one of the parameters to the kernel function request_threaded_irq() are invalid and it returns error -22 EINVAL, \"Invalid parameter\".  From what I can intuit from the code, it is most likely that the interrupt is invalid or the settings requested are not valid.  As it stands, this error means that some thermal zone trip point information cannot be read, so it may affect the ability to measure and/or control the systems temperature.\nSince this driver is not running (because of the initialization failure), the only affect it can have is perhaps being able to control thermal overrun (for example via thermald), but that kind of issue would manifest itself in a machine shutdown on thermal overrun, which you are not seeing, hence I don't think it is related to your machine hang.\n", "Q: At what time intervals does ntpd update the time?

I presumed there was an issue with the filezilla.xml file. I went to /home/$USER/.config/Filezilla/ deleted the old filezilla.xml file. \nThen went back into the terminal and typed \"filezilla\" to open the program. For me, it opened fine and it created a brand-new default XML file in the old file's place. The site manager options are not affected by this as they are in a different file called \"sitemanager.xml\" which is in the same directory. So the program opened as a fresh new program with the same site manager options as before. \n\nA: Go to ~/.config/Filezilla or ~/.filezilla.\nYou need to press Ctrl+H to show hidden files if necessary.\nThen open filezilla.xml using a text editor.\nRemove the Last local directory tag.\nSave the file again and reopen filezilla.\nThis works for me every time.\n\nA: In addition to andrew.46 answer, you can now import the old sitemanager.xml file in the backup folder once filezilla opens. Use File->Import menu. This is useful if you had a lot of sites saved.\n\nA: TL;DR:\nIn filezilla.xml there is the empty element <Setting name=\"Language Code\" type=\"string\" />. If you add an installed locale such as en_GB.UTF-8 (use locale -a to find available locales), so that you get <Setting name=\"Language Code\" type=\"string\">en_GB.UTF-8</Setting> everything should run smoothly again.\nThe long version:\nI recently ran into this problem as well, using Ubuntu 16.04.3 and  FileZilla 3.15.0.2.\nThe solutions posted here are based on deleting stuff, but that did not solve my problem. I could start FileZilla again, indeed, but it would still crash on start-up if the last local directory contained non-ASCII characters. File and directory names with non-ASCII characters were just blank. Uploading these was also no good idea.\nThe following line is the culprit:\n<Setting name=\"Language Code\" type=\"string\" />\n\nas I would have expected some language or encoding (such as ISO 8859-15). So, I tried one of my installed locales:\n<Setting name=\"Language Code\" type=\"string\">en_GB.UTF-8</Setting>\n\nNow, starting FileZilla would show files and directories with non-ASCII characters again.\nIf you want to find out which locales you have installed, use:\nlocale -a\n\nIf you are not sure whether you are also affected by this issue, this might help: When running filezilla --version with the empty language code, the output looks like this:\nReading locale option from /home/kreuvf/.filezilla/filezilla.xml\nFileZilla 3.15.0.2, compiled on 2016-02-25\n\nAnother indicator I remembered when reading a related question is the following entry in the kern.log:\nkernel: [39162.363835] traps: filezilla[19354] general protection ip:7f99fa048ce6 sp:7fff363ae5e0 error:0 in libwx_gtk2u_core-3.0.so.0.2.0[7f99f9b48000+5f9000]\n\nThe different message compared to the linked question may stem from different kernels (more than three years difference) and all the accompanying things that might have changed in the meantime. Nonetheless, in both cases it is libwx_gtk2u_core-3.0.so.0.2.0 and also the offset (?) of 5f9000 matches.\nSo, if it looks like that for you, chances are good that this solution will work for you.

The fact that TestDisk is reporting CHS values on the disk is a less-than-helpful throwback to the old days. You should ignore that value and not worry about it. You can read more about GPT data structures on its Wikipedia page.. You'll note that all the important data structures use logical block address (LBA) values, not CHS values. The only exception is in the protective MBR, which uses the MBR format as a way to keep GPT-unaware tools from mucking with the disk, and therefore includes both CHS and LBA values. The CHS values are ignored by most tools, though, and some GPT partitioning tools put bizarre and nonsensical values in the protective MBR's CHS fields. Thus, even for this minor case, the CHS geometry of the disk is unimportant.\n", "Q: Docker fails to start if configured to use devicemapper with direct-lvm On Ubuntu 16.04 Docker fails to start on system startup if Docker was configured to use devicemapper as storage driver with direct-lvm as storage-pool.\nThe following errors occur\n\n#$ sudo systemctl status docker\n● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Di 2016-07-12 16:22:33 CEST; 1min 30s ago\n     Docs: https://docs.docker.com\n  Process: 1880 ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// $DOCKER_OPTS (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n Main PID: 1880 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n\nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: Starting Docker Application Container Engine...  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm docker[1880]: time=\"2016-07-12T16:22:33.304838820+02:00\" level=fatal msg=\"Error starting daemon: error initializing graphdriver: devicemapper: Non existing device ubuntu--vg-thinpool\"  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: docker.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: Failed to start Docker Application Container Engine.  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: docker.service: Unit entered failed state.  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: docker.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: docker.service: Start request repeated too quickly.  \nJul 12 16:22:33 docker-lvm systemd[1]: Failed to start Docker Application Container Engine. \n\n\nA: The status messages indicated that my thinpool was not available. lvdisplay said the same:\n\n#$ sudo lvdisplay ubuntu-vg/thinpool\n  --- Logical volume ---\n  LV Name                thinpool\n  VG Name                ubuntu-vg\n  LV UUID                Or2cLx-ENFq-sZqh-kxUw-0FEQ-rEzi-vXCi3C\n  LV Write Access        read/write\n  LV Creation host, time docker-lvm, 2016-07-12 15:57:06 +0200\n  LV Pool metadata       thinpool_tmeta\n  LV Pool data           thinpool_tdata\n  LV Status              NOT available\n  LV Size                14,07 GiB\n  Current LE             3601\n  Segments               1\n  Allocation             inherit\n  Read ahead sectors     auto\n\nNote:\n  LV Status              NOT available\nTrying to activate it said:\n\n#$ sudo lvchange -ay ubuntu-vg/thinpool\n  /usr/sbin/thin_check: execvp failed: No such file or directory\n  Check of pool ubuntu-vg/thinpool failed (status:2).

You can use i.bak to create a file.bak backup file of the original. You can also run it without the -i to see the changes before they're applied. The s/foo/bar/ is the substitution operator. It will replace the first instance of foo with bar. The $ marks the end of the line, and * means \"0 or more\". So, s/,*$/,/ means \"replace 0 or more commas at the end of the line with one comma\". If no commas are there, one will be added and if there are more than one, they will be replaced with a single one. \nSome other options, for the sake of completion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perl\nperl -i -pe  's/,*$/,/' file\n\nSame idea as the sed above. This is where sed got the -i idea from. \nIf speed is an issue, this one will be the fastest of all the solutions here:\nperl -i -lne 'printf join \",\", (grep {$_ ne \"\"}split(/,/) ); print \",\"' file\n\n\n*awk\nawk '{sub(/,*$/,\",\")}1;' file >newfile\n\nOr, with newer versions of (g)awk:\nawk -iinplace '{sub(/,*$/,\",\")}1;' file\n\n\n*Pure shell (slower and less efficient, only included as an example):\nwhile read line; do echo \"${line/%,*/},\"; done < file > newfile\n\nThe ${var/%foo/bar} will replace any foo from the end of the variable var with bar. Here, we're replacing everything after the last comma, so this won't work if you have multiple commas per line, it only works on your example. The other solutions don't have any of these limitations.\n", "Q: Automatic backup of Mysql database to Amazon s3 server using script and crontab I am new to this concept so can someone please guide me the script code details and the proper usage of crontab while backing up database to amazon s3 server at a desired time.\nI went through different links but none of them explained how the backup takes place.

Just installed Ubuntu Mate, and am facing a strange issue: I have to manually enable the trackpad every-time I reboot the system.. \nIt's getting quite annoying, and if anyone can help out by creating a script or something or point me to a program, or help out in simulating the Fn and the F7 key, that would be awesome.. \n\nA: I am not aware of any way to simulate the Fn key through using like xdotool or something similar.  However, that being said, you can write a script that you can run at startup to enable your trackpad.\nThis is an alternate way to do this.\nFor this, we are going to use xinput.  Unfortunately, I do not have a trackpad on this system, but the commands should be used the same way.\nFirst, run from a terminal the following command:\nxinput --list\n\nyou are going to be looking for your trackpad in the list.  I am just going to use my mouse as the example.\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ xinput --list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Kensington      USB/PS2 Wheel Mouse       id=8    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nMy mouse is shown as Kensington      USB/PS2 Wheel Mouse so that is what we are going to get the props for.  Run the next command to see the props that you can set for the device:\nxinput --list-props '<device name>'\n\nExample: (Mine gives a ton of information, so I truncated it to the information we need.  Device Enabled is really what we are looking for.)\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ xinput --list-props 'Kensington      USB/PS2 Wheel Mouse'\nDevice 'Kensington      USB/PS2 Wheel Mouse':\n    Device Enabled (152):   1\n\nThe Device Enabled (152): 1 shows that my mouse is enabled.  To disable my mouse it would be just to set that to 0, but in your case you want it enabled or set to 1.  The command to enable it would be:\nxinput --set-prop '<device name>' 'Device Enabled' 1\n\nMy command to enable my mouse would be:\nxinput --set-prop 'Kensington      USB/PS2 Wheel Mouse' 'Device Enabled' 1\n\nThen you can add the command with the full path to the xinput command to the /etc/rc.local file.  You need to make sure that you keep the exit 0 as the last line in the /etc/rc.local file.  \nwhich xinput\n\nwill give you the full path to the file.\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ which xinput\n/usr/bin/xinput\n\nAfter you have that, now add your line to the /etc/rc.local file:\n/usr/bin/xinput --set-prop '<device name>' 'Device Enabled' 1\n\nThat should now run before you get to the login screen.\nIt has been brought to my attention that it can get overruled after login.  So, you can add a .desktop file to the /etc/xdg/autostart/ folder that will launch with every user that logs into the system.\nI called my file mouse_enable.desktop and I added the following lines to it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nType=Application\nName=mouse_enable\nExec=/bin/bash -c 'sleep 15 && /usr/bin/xinput --set-prop \"<device name>\" \"Device Enabled\" 1'\n\nMake the file owned by root:\nsudo chown root:root /etc/xdg/autostart/mouse_enable.desktop\n\nMake the file have the correct permissions:\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/xdg/autostart/mouse_enable.desktop\n\nNow when logging in it should keep the device enabled.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: OpenGL update for intel graphic It all started with me wanting to use OpenGL 4 to play games on my ubuntu 16.04 laptop.

You should update SSD firmware regardless of the OS; it does wonders for the drive and keeps its life-span stable, controls writing and reading, eliminates bugs and improves performance.\nTo upgrade it, use the Intel® SSD Firmware Update Tool, which is independent from the OS, from their website, but prior to that, check if your current SSD firmware version is the latest.\nUse smartmontools:\n\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools\n\nThen\n\nsudo smartctl -i /dev/sda\n\nMy firmware is R21, which is the latest according to the website:\nhttps://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/18363/Intel-SSD-Firmware-Update-Tool\n", "Q: Problems with ssh I have two VMs running Ubuntu server 16.04 on the same host machine, let us call them A and B.

So far I am really happy with Terminator. However, the GNOME terminal asks for permission before closing if something is running in the terminal (for example if you ssh to another computer using GNOME terminal and you want to close that terminal by clicking the X button, it will prompt you with a message asking for permission to close) while Terminator doesn't.

It is normally used to access Sybase and Microsoft MS SQL databases (cfr their home page). I would suppress (or at least rename) the freetds.conf file and put everything in the odbc.ini file like this (I let it to you to decide if the userid/password is better encoded in the ini file or elsewhere):\n--- /etc/odbc.ini ---\n[STODS1]\nDriver = Oracle\nServer = stods1.xxxx.xxxxxxx.com\nPort = 1521\nDatabase = STODS1\nUSER = youroracleusername\nPASSWORD = youroracleuserpassword\n\n"]
