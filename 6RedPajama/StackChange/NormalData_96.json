The new \"Workspace\" icon is very similar the \"Terminal\" icon and I prefer the older icon. How can I change it?\n\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my English ;-)\n\nA: In a gnome-terminal do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the old icon:\nsudo mv /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/apps/48/workspace-switcher.png{,.bak}\n\n\n*Convert the old icon from SVG to PNG and place it in the correct directory (this needs the convert program from the imagemagick package, which is not installed by default):\nsudo convert -background None /usr/share/icons/Humanity/apps/48/gnome-panel-workspace-switcher.svg /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/apps/48/workspace-switcher.png\n\n\n*Update the theme's icon cache:\nsudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme\n\n\n*Restart unity\n(unity &)\n\nThe downside: whenever the icon theme gets updated, you'd need to repeat that process.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nA: If you change your icon theme, it usually changes that icon as well. Personally I use an older version of the humanity theme along with the one in 11.04. To achieve the same thing, you can copy the theme from an older install (or a Live CD for example).\nIf you need it, I can link to the older theme (optionally), or even tell you to make a custom theme that will keep all of the new icons (and remain updated) while using the old icon (leave me a comment and I will update my answer).\n\nA: There is an easier way that doesn't involve converting and things like that. \nyou can simply set a customized icon in /usr/share/applications.\nI explained it in my blog in detail.\n", "Q: How can I get the Skype notification back in the system tray? I am running 11.04. I have Skype running but it does not show up in the notification tray. It was working until I added Skype to auto-start when I log in. Does anyone know how to make it reappear?\n\nA: Make sure you are not experiencing this bug (Launchpad.net)\nSometimes, the Skype indicator is only one green pixel. It's easy to overlook and assume there is no indicator at all.\nIf this is the case, just quit and restart Skype and it will come back normally. I have this quite often.\n\nA: You can get skype tray in 11.10 and 12.04 installing package sni-qt:i386\nsudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386\nOR\nYou can whitelist systray as well\nHow do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray?\nOR\nIf you like how empathy and messaging tray work you can install a third party skype-wrapper package from ppa which enables Skype to indicator-message\n\nYou can install it with\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:skype-wrapper/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype-wrapper\n\nSOURCE\n\nA: Install dconf-tools  / sudo apt-get install dconf-tools.  \nThen run the conf editor by typing:\ndconf-editor\n\nat the command line.\nThere under Desktop > Unity > Panel\n\nchange the line that says:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'hp-systray', 'scp-dbus-service']` \n\ninto this here:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'hp-systray', 'scp-dbus-service', 'Skype']\n\nYou can change it to ['all'] which allows all tray applications to show there icons in the indicator bar (Ah-Duh!). As usual changes will take effect only after reboot or restarting unity by Alt+F2ing\nunity --replace &\n\n\nA: I have figured out the cause and the fix, at least in my case.\nThe problem was that Skype was loading before the systray application.  The solution was to delay Skype on start up.  Someone else may have a more programmer worthy fix, but my solution was to change my KDE startup options to \"start with a blank session\" instead of remembering the last session.  I then created a file in ~/.kde/Autostart with the name skype.sh. Here's the text I put in mine:\n#!/bin/dash\n\nsleep 15\n/usr/bin/skype\nexit\n\nAfterwards I did chmod +x ~/.kde/Autostart/skype.sh\nIt's working great.\n\nA: For me in 14.04;\n\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor\n\n*Search systray (couldn't find in other answers on mine)\n\n*On show-icon-on-systray click off the tick then back on again, then click restore default button.\n", "Q: What happens when I install the package \"linux\"? I see a package called \"Linux\" in Synaptic in 10.04, and I want to know what happens when I install it, without making my system unusable.

My preseed server install file executes a number of additional tasks with a bash script called with preseed/late_command.   I wish to prompt for a password during this process to install LDAP properly.  How can I do this in debconf style?\n\nA: From the Ubuntu Wiki Custom Install CD\n\nGenerally, a script run from the seed file via late_command, cannot interact with the user. If you need to interact, there are generally three options:\n\n1. Create a custom UDEB that interacts with debconf, and include it with the CD.\n2. Create a 'firstrun' script that executes the first time the system boots, and disables itself on completion.\n3. Access debconf directly within your script. \n\nPersonally I use the 'first run' method and run the scripts post install. I have not used the other two methods.\n", "Q: Tablet pen doesn't work correctly when in portrait mode I'm using a lenovo x201 tablet. I recently upgraded to 11.04.

I don't really know what relevant information to post here...\nI'm using Ubuntu 11.04 with unity enabled using free drivers for the Nvidia card FX-5200 256MB (private drivers don't work).\nI'm using an 19\" LG monitor which has a brightness configuration menu, but changing is kind of annoying, and takes a lot longer that if I had a key command. So, can I set a shortcut to set brightness level from the keyboard like as I were using a laptop?\n\nA: If your monitor implements the backlight property, you can adjust it with the xbacklight tool. xbacklight -inc 10% increases backlight by 10%, and xbacklight -dec 10% decreases it. However, it will not work unless the monitor explicitly support it, like laptop displays without built-in controls does.\n\nA: I don't think that's possible since the brightness levels are controlled and manipulated within the monitor. I could be wrong but I believe that the operating system cannot control that.\n", "Q: Sub folders in /home/Documents \"disappeared\" from Nautilus view The /home/martin/Documents folder has sub folders.

I installed Weather Indicator for Ubuntu 11.04, but I can't find the information about the felt air temperature (like temperature is 30 degree, feels like 32 degree).

For the latest features and bug fixes (including felt air temperatures when they arrive), add our PPA: ppa:weather-indicator-team/ppa\nIf you want felt air temperatures now, then perhaps you should try My-Weather-Indicator, another weather indicator.\nDisclosure: I'm involved with indicator-weather.\n", "Q: Duplicate Application Icons appear in Dash I have duplicate application icons appearing in Dash with no idea how to resolve.\n\n\nA: Well it came down to a simple capital letter to confuse Dash. \n/usr/share/applications/docky.desktop\n~/.local/share/applications/Docky.desktop\nRemoving the latter desktop entry solved the issue.\n", "Q: Back in time on Natty Since Ubuntu's Maverick release I had been using Back In Time for my backup needs.

It is accompanied by modprobe, wait-for-root and udevd.  They take up about 25% of my computer's boot time and nothing seems to be happening during this time according to the graphs above the process chart.\nIt would be nice if someone gave an explanation of these processes, what they do, why udevadm is a zombie most of the time and why nothing appears to be happening in the time they are running.  If this is unnatural behaviour, I would also appreciate help on how to fix this.\n\nA: The udevadm invocation probably comes from the /etc/init/udevtrigger.conf Upstart script.  It executes udevadm settle, which just sleeps until the udevd daemon says it has finished setting up the device nodes for your hardware.  So the fact that it is sleeping is not an indication of a problem.\nThe primary purpose for running this command during startup is so that an Upstart event is generated when it completes.  For example, the Upstart script for the printing subsystem is set to start after the udevtrigger script completes, since it needs access to the device nodes of the configured printers.\nThe other tools you mention act in similar ways: they sleep until some event has occurred and then return.  The wait-for-root tool is used to wait until the device holding the root file system is ready, and modprobe would be waiting until the kernel has finished loading a given kernel module.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the 'sudo' and 'admin' group? I noticed that two groups are granted similar-looking permissions in /etc/sudoers:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nMy user account with \"Administer the system\" privileges is in the admin group, and there don't appear to be any users in the sudo group. What are these two groups for?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later\nAdministrators are added to the sudo group, but the admin group is supported for backward compatibility. From the release notes:\n\nUp until Ubuntu 11.10, administrator access using the sudo tool was granted via the admin Unix group. In Ubuntu 12.04, administrator access will be granted via the sudo group. This makes Ubuntu more consistent with the upstream implementation and Debian. For compatibility purposes, the admin group will continue to provide sudo/administrator access in 12.04.\n\nIt is not created when you do a fresh install, though it is still present if you upgraded from previous distributions. Either way, the admin group appears in the /etc/sudoers file.\nSee implementation details and the official documentation.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 and earlier\nBy default the sudo group is not used in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*the user created during installation belongs to admin group, not sudo;\n\n*no guide or manual I ever read advices to use the sudo group;\n\n*no one feels the need to use the sudo group, because the admin group can do all one needs.\n\n\nConversely, on Debian the group enabled in /etc/sudoers is the sudo group, and there is no admin group. But the user created during installation is not put in that group, because Debian has the root account enabled. You should do it explicitly, if you want to.\nAlso, Fedora is similar to Debian, having root enabled and no default privileges for the user create during installation. But the administrative group configured in /etc/sudoers is the more traditional group wheel.\nIn conclusion, I think there is no use for sudo group in Ubuntu, simply it is a Debian heritage.\n\nA: No security difference.\nBoth have 100% unrestricted access to anything provided by the OS.\nThe difference in your /etc/sudoers is (ALL) vs (ALL:ALL). The first one means you can run commands as any user. The second - you can run command as any user and as any group.\nThe way shown in your /etc/sudoers both groups will need to enter their own password to execute commands as root.\nBoth can a root shell like this:\nsudo su\n\n", "Q: How do I share files with a Mac? I would like to allow a Mac user on the same network to edit (in-place) a stylesheet file on my localhost.\nHence I would like to share /var/www/site1 with users on the network.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: you could install gshare.\nwith it you can select what folders you want to share just by right clicking them. \nsudo apt-get install gshare\n\nHere is my home folder that I share in my local network.\n\n\nA: NFS is also an option. Read the Ubuntu NFS documentation for instructions on how to set up the NFS server. See this Apple KB document for easy instruction on how to connect to the NFS server.\n\nA: I think that Mac supports samba (SMB) so you could set up a share that way.  There are instructions for setting up a samba share on the help.ubuntu.com site.\nThe other possibility is netatalk.  This allows you to set up a share in the mac native AFP protocal.  I found some decent instructions for setting this up on the missingreadme blog.\nI should note that I don't believe that netatalk will allow sharing from your friends mac.

All you have to do to Copy is select any text and then Middle-click to Paste.\nThere must be a way to change that behavior. Perhaps you could even do it without going into the source code and re-compiling.\nDo you really want give up the middle click paste?! Middle-click paste is one of the greatest conveniences of X desktops. It saves me a lot of time and I believe it kept me from getting the Carpal tunnel syndrome.\nWhile tiring to figure how to get the closing-tabs-by-middle-clinking behavior, closing tabs one can close tabs by pressing Ctrl-w.\nEdit: Sorry, I didn't realize that the question author was talking about middle-clicking ON the tabs to close them. Both functionalities can co-exist.\n\nA: To actually answer the question here: this can only be achieved per application.  \nFor gedit there is tabs-enhanced.\n", "Q: How do I down sync from ubuntuone to my computer? I did a clean install of Ubuntu Natty. Now I can't get UbuntuOne to sync my files. The files are in UbuntuOne I can read them. Previously I installed Natty Beta 2 and everything worked fine. It seems like it was automatic.\n\nA: If you setup your computer with Ubuntu One then it should sync all the files in your Ubuntu One folder automatically and allow you to select which \"cloud folders\" you want to sync under the \"Cloud Folders\" tab in the Ubuntu One Control Panel. \nWe were having problems with one of our servers that was impacting some users from either connecting to the service reliably or syncing files in a timely manner.

If I plug in iPod to my computer, can the Nautilus access the storage?\nIf not, then what would be the best application to access an iPad/iPod (apart from Banshee)?\n\nA: Yes, you can access ipods from nautilus. But all files that you synchronise to an ipod are renamed and stored in folders, that are managed by an ipod-database. So it doesn't make sense to use nautilus.\nThe best application depends on your apple-device and software version.

Sometimes they worked with some iPods, sometimes not.\nIf nothing else worked, I used iTunes in a virtual box running Windows XP.\n\nA: Rhythmbox works absolutely fine for iPods other than Touch/iPhone and will be able to do anything you want it to, like transferring songs from computer to device, deleting songs and even transferring songs from device to computer (which iTunes cannot do). In fact, it syncs much faster than iTunes, though editing tags is hard (you need to edit the tag on the song in the Library, then delete the one on the iPod and transfer from Library to Device).\n", "Q: How do I get the Ubuntu One client in my native language?

I am using the following command to mount a ssh ubuntu directory to my ubuntu pc.\nsshfs user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx:/dir/dir /home/username/mount/xxx\n\nMy question is, can I create a script for this in my desktop where I can make a double click and run this script when ever I need to mount the drive without manually typing the command always.\n\nA: This forum thread shows a method of creating an automounting SSHFS which seems to me exactly what you would like to do. \n\nA: You can simply type this to a shell script, and you can create a launcher for it at the desktop.\nFor example mountssh.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nshfs user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx:/dir/dir /home/username/mount/xxx\n\nmake sure to chmod +x mountssh.sh and then clicking it will execute\nAlternatively, you can mount it via gvfs, by right clicking at the desktop, and creating a launcher with URL parameter: ssh://user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx/dir/dir. By default it mounts to ~/.gvfs/.... If you want stick with the /home/username/mount/xxx, you can create symlink from the gvfs one to this.\n\nA: You could even take it a step further and have autofs take care of the mounting for you. Since autofs doesn't work particularly well with SSH public key authentication (unless you want to create a passwordless key pair for the superuser), there are tools that allow you to use the user's SSH keys, ssh-agent and keychain:\n\n\n*\n\n*autosshfs: per user SSHFS automount using user's SSH configuration\n\n*afuse: an automounter implemented with FUSE\n\n\nA: I am adding an fstab method, since no one talks about it in this page. If you don't want hacks and use the builtin advanced mounting features, you need to use /etc/fstab and never look back.\n​\nuser@host:/remote/folder /mount/point fuse.sshfs noauto,x-systemd.automount,_netdev,IdentityFile=/home/name/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,reconnect 0 0\n\n​\n\n*\n\n*noauto will stop the no-brainer actions like forcibly mounting whatsoever at booting regardless if the network is up or not.\n\n*x-systemd.automount is the smart daemon that knows when to mount.\n\n*The _netdev tag will also identify that it uses network devices, thus it will wait until the network is up.\n​​​​​​\n\n\nA: You could create a launcher and add it to your launcher bar by drag&dropping the .desktop-file there:\n    #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Version=1.0\n    Type=Application\n    Terminal=false\n    Icon[en_US]=nautilus\n    Name[en_US]=Connect to xy\n    Exec=shfs user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx:/dir/dir /home/username/mount/xxx\n    #OR: to mount and than open in nautilus (note the '/dir' where ':dir' used to be)\n    #Exec=nautilus sftp://user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx/dir/dir\n    Comment[en_US]=Connect to xy via ssh\n    Name=Connect to xy\n    Comment=Connect to xy via ssh\n    Icon=nautilus\n\nSuggestion - even less work:\nIf you want even less work (=autoconnect) and a graphical user interface, you might want to check out Gigolo . It has the capability of auto-mounting a bookmark, whenever the bookmarked filesystem is present. You might want to check that out.\nsudo apt-get install gigolo   # or use the install link above\n\nRun gigolo. There is an option in the preferences that puts it into autostart and another to activate the tray icon. Check both. Then add your bookmark.\nHere is a screenshot:\n\nShell way\nAnother solution would be to put the following line in your crontab (edit /etc/crontab with sudo privileges):\n@reboot sshfs user@192.xx.xx.xx.xx:/dir/dir /home/username/mount/xxx\n\nBut since Ubuntu's password manager is not present when the command is run you need to use a password-less private/public key pair to authenticate with the ssh server in question (or a similar method of authentication). This would mount it on every reboot.\nYet another solution would be to edit your /etc/fstab (providing your Ubuntu-Version provides that option).\n\nA: I mount a folder the exact same way, what i did was create a custom launcher that points to a .sh file that contains the command. Just make sure the file has execution permission and you're good to go. \nI just click on the launcher: \n\n\nA: I tried to use cron to automatically mount ssh directory, but it causes an error saying Network is unreachable. It is because the cron job execution is too early to establish ip connections. After I inserted sleep before the sshfs command, it successfully mount the ssh directory.\nsleep 5 && sshfs ......\n\nSo I made this script to fulfill my requirement.\n#! /bin/sh\nwhile true\ndo \n    ping -c1 -w1 ssh_server_ip > /dev/null && break\ndone\nsshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3 sshname:/mountpath /localmountpath\n\n\nA: Since none of the answers worked for me and I managed to figure this out, I figured I should share it with the world. My solution also autoreconnects when the mount disconnects and works when the machine boots up without problems. Just add this to your /etc/fstab file (one-liner):\nuser@user.example.org:/  /mnt/location   fuse.sshfs    defaults,allow_other,_netdev,IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_rsa,default_permissions,uid=YOURIDHERE,gid=YOURIDHERE,follow_symlinks,reconnect    0  0\n\n\nSome notes:\nYou NEED SSH keys for this apparently. You can copy your SSH keys using ssh-copy-id or manually - which one you prefer. The automounting only works with SSH keys in other words. You can troubleshoot the SSH connection with editing the fstab file and then calling mount -av.\nallow_other allows when the root has mounted the automount that not only the root can access it.\nIdentityFile is the necessary pointer to the SSH key as evidenced in Arch Wiki, but apparently not described what syntax it uses.\nJust don't forget to replace the placeholders for uid and gid ;) I think you can comma separate the IDs, but I haven't tried it.\nThis was super useful for my Nextcloud instance, since I wanted to remotely mount an external storage box and follow_symlinks allows the required functionality for supporting symlinks in the mount, which is required for Nextcloud when you start using external storage and similar stuff.\n", "Q: Why does Samba always time-out whilst copying a large file off a network share? I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 (natty), kernel 2.6.38-8-generic, GNOME 2.32.1.\nEDIT: As of 3 April 2012 I'm now on kernel 2.6.38-13-generic (still same Ubuntu and GNOME). The problem still persists.\nI have a Synology DiskStation DS207 NAS connected to my home network. Both of these devices are connected to the network via wired gigabit ethernet.\nI access the NAS via Samba on the Ubuntu box.\nMy problem is that every time I try to copy a large file from one of the NAS's Samba shares to the Desktop on the Ubuntu box using Nautilus, the operation times-out and fails about a third of the way through the copy (roughly about 3 mins into the operation).\nI have retried the copy 3 times and the same thing has happened every time.\nHowever, I also have a Windows 7 installation on a different drive in the same PC as the Ubuntu install, and if I boot into Windows 7 and try to copy the file using that OS instead then it works perfectly. This proves (to me at least) that the file and the network connection and hardware are actually all fine.\nSo does anyone have any ideas about what might be going wrong when trying to copy the file in Ubuntu? Is there simply a \"samba keep-alive\" setting or similar that I need to set somewhere?\nBy the way, here's a screenshot of the error I get:\n\n\nA: My problem solved. I checked the server hardware and recognized, two of fans are blocked because of dirt (motherboard and video card).

What's the recommended way to run virtualised Windows environment on top of Ubuntu nowadays? \nI need to create new Windows virtual machines too, not only use existing ones, so, to my understanding, VMware Player would not be enough. \nI've used VMware Server earlier, but I'm having too many problems getting its latest version to work on latest Ubuntu (11.04)... Probably related to this:\n\nVMware has declared VMware Server End\n  Of Availability on January 2010 with\n  the actual support ending on June\n  30th, 2011. [...] Furthermore, VMware Server is\n  not officially supported on Ubuntu\n  releases greater than 8.04.\n\nSo, are there any good alternatives to VMware Server?\n\nA: VirtualBox\nOriginally a commercial product VirtualBox is now open source. The open source version  lacks only few features. Having said that VirtualBox is still a great virtualization tool and future versions look very promising. Like all other virtualization software VirtualBox allows you to run a guest operating systems on your PC, in this case either Windows or Linux based. The guest operating system support covers most Windows (including Vista) and Linux versions as well as OS/2 Warp, OpenBSD and FreeBSD.\nVirtualBox is a stable tool with performance similar to it's commercial counter pieces. A product well worth trying out\n\nXen\nXen is state-of-the-art virtualization on the PC - and it is even open source. With a high performance mainly due to it's architecture with the hypervisor and it's support for hardware virtualization - Xen sets a new standard for virtualization software. Already used in many data centers Xen has shown that it is stable and a product you can rely upon. It matches almost any feature you get from commercial virtualization software - but includes the most advanced such as virtual machine relocation and per virtual machine resource guarantees.\nOpenVZ\nOpenVZ is a great alternative to standard virtualization offerings on the market, that unlike most other products only offers operating system level virtualization - and only on Linux. However, this is also it's strength - but no providing a complete virtual pc to run any operating system, OpenVZ's shared operating system provides better utilization of your server hardware.\nEvery virtual server running under OpenVZ has full root access, but OpenVZ makes sure that there are no conflicts between the different virtual server. Thus, each server has it's own IP addresses, dedicated memory, application, libraries and so on. \nOpenVZ is backed by SWsoft and could be considered an open source edition of the Virtuozzo product.\nCooperative Linux\ncoLinux is an extremely interesting new approach to virtualization allowing you to run Linux parallel to your Windows platform. coLinux approaches the experimenting Linux novice - who does not actually want to install the operating system on a fresh machine. Another target group is the Linux enthusiast, in that coLinux also makes it possible for him to run Linux on his Windows machine without using a standard virtualization product with large requirements to system resources. \ncoLinux seems to be a promising ongoing project - and a worthy competitor to other virtualization products on the market. It might not be completely fool proof for beginners, but it may become more so as it matures.\n\nSource\n\nA: My preferred preference is VirtualBox.  The latest version from Oracle has full USB support if you install the VirtualBox Guest Additions.\nFollow the downloads link here to install the correct version for your architecture - i386 for 32bit and AMD64 for 64bit.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox opens out of focus from Sound Menu I'm using Ubuntu Natty, though I had noticed this problem in Maverick as well. Because Rhythmbox opens up out of focus, pressing Ctrl-W/Ctrl-Q has the alarming effect of shutting down whatever application was behind Rhythmbox; in my case, generally Firefox. Since nobody else seems to be experiencing this problem, could it be a problem my end?\n\nA: Don't worry, it's not just you. :)\nThe same problem was reported as a Banshee bug as well, but it was closed because this is actually a bug with Compiz. If you have a Launchpad account, you may want to click the \"this affects me too\" link and mention that Rhythmbox is also affected by this when it is opened from the sound menu.\n", "Q: Unity launcher doesn't hide automatically on start up When you start an application, say, Firefox, the Launcher continues to be placed over it.

This machine has samba shares on it serving media and I usually rdp or ssh into it. Now my issue is I want the machine to go into sleep mode(so the state is saved from ram to the harddrive) and it will seem like it is turned off after an hour of idling.\nIf there is any attempt to access the samba share through LAN I would like it to wake up. Now my motherboard supports this function, can anyone point me in the right direction for achieving this easily?\nThanks\n\nA: The best instruction I have found on the web was the XBMC wiki for WOL. In short (more info in the link):\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to enable WOL on your motherboard;\n\n*Install ethtool: sudo apt-get install ethtool;\n\n*Set Wake-on-LAN options: sudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g;\n\n*Get it enabled at system start-up with an init script. There's an init script in the wiki link.\nUntested; info from the wiki link\n\nA: Further than sleep mode, what you're looking for is hibernate, as you want to save your state in your harddisk and shutdown completely the server.\nSo, as many have pointed, the answe is WOL (Wake On Lan). There are a lot of tutorials about it, but mainly you need to set up the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your router has to bypass the magic packet (as the WOL packet is called) to your server, so you need to do the port forwarding. It's usually located in the LAN section. The default ports are 7 and 9.\n\n*Your motherboard needs to be listening on LAN port when is powered off. The most of modern MBs provide this feature, but is disabled by default. Check it! In my case, it is called \"Power on by Ring on Lan\".\n\n\nServer doesn't need more setting than the suitable power management configuration to get the system down after an hour of inactivity (it could be done from System > Administration > Power management).\nObviously, you have to wait for a while after you sent the WOL packet, as your system needs to de-hibernate and it could take a few.\nGood luck\n\nA: I decided I wanted a solution to wake my media server automatically when accessed that wasn't dependent on dd-wrt. \nI have a raspberry pi so I used it because it is low power and I don't mind keeping it on all the time, of course it could be run from any linux machine. \nThe final solution I found for myself was writing a little bash script. The raspberry-pi dependencies are etherwake and tcpdump. Both are not installed by default on rasbian.  Also on the server Wake On Lan needs to be enabled as mentioned in the other posts.\nsudo apt-get install etherwake\nsudo apt-get install tcpdump\n\nThe wake script is as follows:\nnano ~/wol.sh\n\nThen:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npingInterval=60 #time interval, in seconds, between checks that the server is still awake.\ntarget=192.168.x.x  #WOL target ip address\ntargetMAC=00:11:22:33:44:55  #WOL target MAC\n\nwake () {\n    tcpdump -i eth0 -c 1 -p host $target\n    etherwake $targetMAC\n    #echo WOL sent to $target at $targetMAC\nreturn\n}\n\nwhile sleep $pingInterval; do\nvarPing=`ping -s 1 -c 2 $target > /dev/null; echo $?`\n    if [ $varPing -eq 0 ]; then\n        #echo ping success\n    else\n        #echo ping fail\n        wake\n    fi\ndone\n\nThe primary idea is that it is run from my raspberry-pi which will wake the server if it notices a single arp request for the server. If the server is awake then it wont be listening for an arp request but send a few pings every now and then to make sure it is still awake.\nI named the file wol.sh and made it executable. Then put it in the sudo crontab to launch @reboot as root. This is for tcpdump which needs elevated access to listen to eth0 and etherwake.\nsudo chmod +x /home/pi/wol.sh\nsudo crontab -e\n\nadd this to the bottom\n@reboot sh /home/pi/wol.sh > /dev/null\n\n\nA: With WoL enabled on your server to get it to wake up to specific protocol traffic you would need something like a script running on your router that has packet rules and can send the WoL magic packet when it receives the request. \nWebserver wakeup example\n\nA: Wake On Lan is the key, nearly all cards today support all modes (but not in linux :( ).\nEasiest solution is a card which has a working Linux driver that supports Wake On Lan modes: pumbg in ethtool, you want something like unicast mode. So your computer starts as soon as you access its network address. But it is even more hard to get a list of cards which are supported by Linux, one I have found is Intel Gigabit Netzwerkadapter Pro/1000 GT PCI.\nA workaround is, if you have a card that does not support all modes:\nNearly all linux driver supports the g mode => magic packet. So you have to explictly turn your server on before you use it.\n", "Q: Error 'Render ring head forced to zero' I have encountered this error message quite a few times now, usually at startup: *ERROR* render ring head forced to zero.

Original Question:\nAfter I replaced my Ubuntu 10.10 with 11.04 all I get when I Ctrl+Alt+F1–F6 into a tty is a black screen. Also when I boot there's a while of black screen after grub2 menu is displayed. Then until just before gnome starts it stays black.\nI have an Nvida Geforce Quadro FX 770M on my HP EliteBook 8530w. How do I get my ttys (aka 'virtual terminals') to work again?\nMy efforts in chronological order:\n\n\n*\n\n*So grub and gfx-payload seems to be the problem, I figured. I went along with this guide for higher tty resolution. Which led to the grub2 menu displaying in my native resolution rather than 800x600. The black screen problem remains.\n\n*I googlehit some bugreports on other nvidia cards having that problem.\n\n*I tried uninstalling the nvidia driver. No effect. Also tried different resolutions\n\n*With an older version of the kernel it works. Though not perfectly. The ttys are usable, black screen between grub2 menu and gnome start remains. Not really a solution.\n\n*Tried so much, that I lost track. Reinstalled grub2 and linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic. Then did this to my /etc/default/grub in accordance with the aforementioned guide (/etc/grub.d/00_header edited as well):\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=3\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\n#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1680x1050x32\n\nTo my surprise I can now use my ttys in native resolution.

Plus afaik it does not need any setting up: it uses the currently active mail setup.\nAs an example you could make a script with a ping and a mail with an attachment and a mailbody(with the same information) like this:\nping www.google.nl -c 4 > {attachment}\nping www.google.nl -c 4 > {/dir/to/mailbody}\nmutt {mailadress} -s {subject} -a {attachment} -c {cc} -b {bcc} < {/dir/to/mailbody}\nAnd the launcher, icon or a link or what ever you want this to activate it just needs to launch the script.\n", "Q: What if I don't have a bashrc? Will I be able to login? What havoc will it cause, if any? How will it mess up m terminal? There are login and non-login terminals too. How will it affect those?\n\nA: It is fine not to have a bashrc file (apparently you mean a personal ~/.bashrc file).\nThe effects of not having the default bashrc file can be examined by reading what the default .bashrc file changes in your shell environment. There is nothing critical in the .bashrc file; bash will simply use (conservative) defaults when it is being run (for example, no aliases, no completion, no color ls).\nIf the shell is not interactive, the default .bashrc file is not parsed (there is a command at the start that checks whether the shell is interactive; if not, it merely exits).\nIf the system-wide /etc/bash.bashrc is missing, it is still not critical to the system. The most important element from /etc/bash.bashrc is to enable the command-not-found feature; when you type a command that is not found, it gives suggestions as to what packages you can install to get the said command.\n\nA: Try\nman bash\n\nand look at the INVOCATION section. That will explain how bash starts up.\n", "Q: Are there any unwanted gnome libraries for a unity user? My /usr volume has run out of space. Are there any libraries from gnome that is safe to remove. I am using unity and I don't think I will need to use 'Ubuntu classic' again.\nI used apt-get autoremove and clean, but there were no unused libraries. Are there any apps that might not be needed?\nThank you..  \n\nA: As Unity is a shell for Gnome you still need about all of the Gnome stack. Removing metacity and gnome-panel should be safe, but that doesn't free up much space.\n\nA: I am glad you asked such a question as it gives a chance to clear up some things.\nUnity may not directly use GNOME libraries, but the experience provided by Unity depends upon the GNOME platform. If you ran out of space in /usr, then it is likely that you installed too many applications/libraries, and it's time to do an audit.\nWhat I would suggest is looking for any libraries/applications that are auto-removable, and then looking for the applications you use least.\n", "Q: Suggest mp3 player having minimum requirements Please suggest an mp3 player which does the following things apart from play, pause, next & previous. I'm not looking for all the equalizer & stuff. Just playing & option to enqueue at one click is good for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enqueue on double click/Enter or enqueue on right click on the file (like in Windows for Winamp & Foobar).\n\n*Doesn't save the previous playlist\n\n*Hotkey or laptop key support (Optional)\n\n*Simple GUI\n\n\nPlease don't suggest Amarok & Exaile as it's buggy with 10.04.\nCurrently I'm using DeadbeeF, which I liked, but looking for enqueue option as I'm tired of drag & drop. \n\nA: As Enqueue option looks like the main requirement here, may I suggest that with the help of nautilus-actions, we can have an option like \"Add to Playlist\". \nIn case you are interested in the steps to do that, here they are :\n1. Please install nautilus-actions if you don't have it already.\n   $ sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\n\n\n*Open Menu -> Preferences -> Nautilus-Actions Configuration.\n\n*Click on the \"+\" icon on the toolbar to add a new entry.\n\n*We can name the \"Context label\" something like \"Add to Playlist\". Similarly please enter anything of your choice in the Tooltip box. We can also choose an icon for the item (need to mention the path of icon).\n\n*Click on the Command tab and enter your favorite music player's path like \"/usr/bin/audacious\" in the box. \n\n*For the Parameters box, I have entered \"%U\" (without the quotes) and working directory is \"%d\" (without the quotes)\n\n*Save.\n\n*Now in Nautilus go to the music directory and select multiple files and click right button and select \"Add to Playlist\". \nThis should result in the music player to run and play the selected files. It worked for me in Audacious.\nAlthough this might not be the answer you was looking for, I thought to share my thoughts so that in case you like it you can please give it a try.\nEDIT 1 : I am attaching here two screenshots of the nautilus-actions configuration tools. These are the two tabs where I have added the details. I am on Natty. I have nautilus-actions nautilus-scripts-manager and also options like nautilus-gksu installed.\nScreenshot 1 : \n\nScreenshot 2:\n\n\nA: I would have to recommend either Rhythmbox which I find very easy to use and I just use it to play mp3 using the same ideas as you..ie want it simple and easy to use.\nIt gives you the option to turn all the other 'stuff' like last.fm wiki amazon etc off permanently and just get on with your music and was very easy for me to configure when installing Ubuntu \nWhen installed select edit-plugins and untick all the things you do not need or indeed tick all the ones you do!\nMore info available here\ninfo re rhythmbox\n\nA: You should use DeadBeef's --queue option to enqueue files.\nFor example, if you'd like to add this as a Custom Action to Thunar file manager, it would be something like this:\n\n", "Q: gconf for lubuntu? Does gconf have any affect on lubuntu-desktop config? Or does the \"g\" in \"gconf\" mean \"GNOME\", meaning that it's GNOME-only? Or am I missing something? \nReason I'm asking is because I made an edit in gconf for my trackpad, and it doesn't appear to be taking affect in lubuntu, only in GNOME.\n\nA: The g in gconf does mean gnome. Because it is a gnome project it might not work in lubuntu. To change the touchpad setting in lubuntu see lubuntu touchpad.\n\nA: Gconf is originally (and still is) a GNOME technology, but that doesn't stop other applications from using it. Probably however, the Lubuntu developers chose not to depend on gconf for their configurations (I've not found them to do so so far).\nThis however does not mean that only GNOME applications use gconf. For example, Avant Window Navigator uses it (optionally I believe), even though it can be run on anything (and is not GNOME specific).\n", "Q: Can't see incoming messages in Empathy and Skype I have stalled Skype for empathy but only outgoing messages work.

A similar appearance can be obtained by using OLWM or OLVWM, but you won't necessarily have the same applications. (though, the applications actually pictured are XV, Netscape, both of which aren't actually part of openwin, and shelltool, which is a fairly boring terminal emulator.)\nI don't think there are any GTK/QT themes that emulate Open Look, though.\nBeyond that, some applications with the same look can be found at http://step.polymtl.ca/~coyote/xview_main.html - I don't think any of them are packaged.\n\nA: Try FVWM \nhttp://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/desktops/\n", "Q: How do I get my laptop's Line In inlet to output sound? I have a laptop - DELL Studio 1773, but I'm pretty sure the model does not matter. One of it's features I love most is the fact it has TWO headphone outputs. This means Ubuntu can use them to output 4.0 sound.\nBut 4.0 is not enough for me. I would like to get 5.1 surround output.\nAt first sight it seemed impossible for me, but it turned out it is technically possible. The laptop has two audio outputs and one audio input. If the input could somehow output sound, I would get 5.1 surround sound, right?\nThe laptop had Windows Vista preinstalled. And it had a preinstalled app for tuning my sound's parameters (volume, basic filters etc.). I found out this app is able to output 5.1 sound, using the Line In as output (to be precise: it used it for center/sub channels)!\nThat leads to conclusion it IS somehow possible to get the Line In to work as output. How can I do this in Ubuntu? \nAs the preinstalled application proved, the soundcard is capable of outputting audio through what seemed to be an input inlet. But in Ubuntu it behaves only as input.\n-\nNow, my question is:\nIs there any way I can change this, and force my system to do similar trick and output 5.1 audio using 2 headphone outlets, and 1 audio input inlet?\n\nA: If you are lucky, you simply open 'alsamixer' in a console. \nHardware 'channels' have volume bars; switches do not. Use the 'm' letter to change settings. Maybe you have a switch to change that input/output behaviour. Use F-keys and left/right arrows to see all your options.\nNow having pulseaudio as default in Ubuntu, all these alsa settings are somehow 'hidden'. Following picture shows Alsamixer with some 'F2' option.\n\n2nd chance\nIf that is not working, you may have the chance to be able to choose some options for your card and set them as system default on boot. \nFor that you will have to modify /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf (documentation: http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-ca0106 )\nTo choose an option, add something like this to your /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf...\n    # ALSA portion\n    alias char-major-116 snd\n    alias snd-card-0 snd-ca0106   \n    # module options should go here\n    options snd-ca0106 foo=bar\n\nI am not a 100% sure about that module ca0106 though... You can verify that with 'lspci | grep audio' and 'lsmod' in a console.\n\nA: I was able to get my speakers working by changing the \"Channel\" setting from \"2\" to \"6\". Maybe this helps somebody in the future.\n\n", "Q: Silverlight 3 streaming via future Moonlight version? I am trying to watch a streaming service that requires Silverlight 3. Although I installed Moonlight and the browser plugin, I just get a warning that since my URL is Silverlight 3, it may not fully work. But I get nothing.\nAre there any plans to support Silverlight 3 in future versions of Moonlight?\nCheers\n\nA: Yes. As a matter of fact, the Silverlight 3 API is considered feature complete in the Moonlight 4 Preview 1 version:\n\nRelease Notes Moonlight 4 Preview\nMoonlight 4 Preview 1 is the first preview of Moonlight that includes support for the Siverlight 3 APIs and partial support for Silverlight 4 APIs.

Check the: \n\n${ping `hostname`}. \n\n\nIf it send pings to 127.0.1.1 and you actually expect that the address should be 127.0.0.1, that’s the problem. Fix it, for example, by removing record for 127.0.1.1 from your /etc/hosts.\n\n", "Q: 8 GB RAM on 64 bit processor using 32 bit Ubuntu I'm going to repeat the title in a longer word. Can a 32 bit Ubuntu address more than 4 gb of RAM on a 64 bit processor?\n\nA: Like everybody wrote, the system as a whole can use more than 4 GB with PAE. But each process can only address 4 GB.\n\nA: Yes it can. I am running exactly the configuration you are asking for without any problems. \nObviously you need to use the PAE kernel.\nHowever, you should think about if it is better to run the 64bit kernel since it allows to use the CPU more effectively. It depends on what you are intent to do with the computer if a 32bit kernel or a 64bit kernel is more efficient.\n\nA: For what i have learn, if you install the 32Bit Ubuntu on a PC that has more than 4GB or Ram it will automatically switch to PAE Mode so it can use the additional memory. There is no need to enable it since it does it automatically when it sees you have more than 4GB of ram.\nFor the performance of using PAE do not worry about it since the difference between it and the normal 32bit is less than 2% when using the memory above the 4GB. When using the memory in the 4GB range it will be the same performance.\n\nA: You need to use the PAE Linux kernel. The installer should be able to select the PAE kernel for you. Make sure that when you install, there is Internet connectivity, so that you get the PAE kernel from the start. If in doubt, you can install using the DVD ISO of Ubuntu (which definitely has the PAE kernel). For more on PAE, see Enabling PAE.\n\nA: 32-bit Ubuntu will automatically install PAE kernel if it detects 4GB RAM or more. You don't have to do anything at all about it. PAE kernel can address up to 64GB RAM. The performance penalty introduced by PAE is insignificant. \n\nA: With PAE you can do something like that, \nbut this causes compatibility problems for some software.\nUnless something doesn't work for you after you've tried it out. \nIt's better to just use 64-bit!\nyou can run 32 bit applications on a 64 bit system with the ia32-libs. \nFinding out if you have them from a terminal:\ndpkg -l|grep ia32-libs\n\nand for installing type in:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nI urge you to use 64-bit.\n", "Q: How do I install packages selectively from repositories? In my case I've got lucid installed on my server but want to install a newer saned version.\nThere is one in the maverick and lucid repositories, how would I add this repository for just that one package?\nWhat should I look for when doing this?\n\nA: In general you can't mix packages from different releases. It may work in some cases when the dependency changes do not have an impact on the package upgrade.\nYour options are to either find a ppa which provides an updated version for your release, or rebuild the package yourself from the latest source, you can find how to do this at:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/rebuilding-ubuntu-debian-linux-binary-package/\n", "Q: How to open Mac documents .page, on LibreOffice I need to open text documents. \"page\" and\nkeynote presentations also keep in osx, how do I open or install\nthis extension in libreoffice?\n\nA: There are many free online conversion tools for this.\ncloudconvert.com can convert to doc, docx or PDF. Just upload your documents, and it converts in the cloud.\n\nA: If you don't have access to an Apple operating system, use Apple's no-cost 'in-browser' version of Pages to export it in a format that you can open with LibreOffice. Unfortunately, Pages doesn't have OpenDocument (ODT) export, (as of 2015), but it does have DOCX (Microsoft Word) and PDF (Portable Document Format) exports.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*With a recent version of Firefox, or Chrome, visit Apple's iCloud website: https://www.icloud.com .\n\n*If you don't have an Apple ID, register for one at no cost.\n\n*Log in with an Apple ID. \n\n*Open Pages. https://www.icloud.com/#pages\n\n*The site asks you to upgrade to a supported browser to use all the features.

My brother a couple months ago bought a netbook and installed ubuntu netbook on it.  He later realized that he did not really use the Asus EEE netbook and wanted to sell it. He said I could have it for 100 dollars.  The problem is he said that Ubuntu netbook is very limiting.  Is it?  I did not like the simplified interface, so I decided I was going to install a full desktop version of Ubuntu on it.  I downloaded the zip file and put it on my flash driver after unzipping it.  I then set the boot order to be from the flash drive and then I booted the machine.   The screen was black and then some text appear.  It flashed to quickly for me to read all of it, or any of it.  \nWas my download and unzip corrupt?  Can you not install Ubuntu desktop over Ubuntu netbook?  If you can how would you?

For my class and my college projects I am working with blender and java\n\nA: You should be able to install Ubuntu over Ubuntu Netbook, however bear in mind Netbooks are not very powerful - running a full Ubuntu install may be too much for them. \nIf you wish to proceed, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick for instructions on how to install from a USB drive - there is a little more to it than simply unzipping  and copying it to the USB drive.\n\nA: Perhaps it would work better with a CD version. I'd try it using an USB CD-drive.\nAlso change the boot sequence in the BIOS.\nI seriously doubt that all you have to do is unzip it to the flash drive. I imagine there must be some proper procedure to make the thumbdrive bootable.\n\nA: Yes get a new image downloaded. Follow the guidance above on how to create a USB image..it is not that hard to do and you can do it on another pc if you cannot get your netbook to start.\nThere is a application for windows or mac or linux that will help you download and create a bootable/installable USB pen drive from unetbootin here\nunetbootin\nThat is fairly easy and should get you a bootable usb pen drive from which you can install on your Asus eee netbook fairly easily\nAlternatively if you can get ubuntu direct from UBUNTU which is probably just as easy here which you can do if you still have windows working on your netbook and it will install ubuntu side by side alongside windows so you can give it a go.\nUbuntu Windows Installer\nHave a go and see how you get on and let us know if either work for you and also what you think of ubuntu on your Asus :)\n\nA: Follow the step in the ubuntu donwload page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu\n\n*Burn your CD or create a USB drive :\nSelect:\n\n\n*\n\n*I would like to create a USB stick\n\n*To create it, I will be using: select the operation system in which you are going  to create the USB image  \n\n*click on show me how  \n\n\n*Try it!\n\n*if you like it!

I cannot tell you the english names of the panel elements because of my german locale, but there seems to be the \"complete indicator applet\" as well as session- and meMenu elements). \nTogether with whitelisting all indicator icons you'd have a pretty much pre 11.04 panel.\n", "Q: How to operate Korean IME? I'm used to the Windows Korean IME... the Ubuntu Korean IME seems to randomly switch to Korean mode, and I have no idea how to switch back~ Please explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to completely uninstall/disable Korean input\n\n*How to identify which IME I'm using; I know there are various Linux IME's. I knew about Nabi, and tried  installing that one, but it seemed like part of the install failed. IBus seems to come pre-installed on Ubuntu. Originally,IBus only offered Chinese IME, but Korean appeared after the failed Nabi installation.\n\n*How to tell which input mode the IME is currently in (Korean Hangul or English 'Roman').: Ibus adds a tiny keyboard icon to the top panel, but it doesn't seem to display the current input mode anywhere. (Compare to Windows Microsoft IME, which displays an icon depending on the input mode (the letter 'A', or the Korean equivalent '아').\n\n*How to switch between Korean Hangul mode and English 'Roman' mode: The IME seems to randomly switch to Korean mode when I type rapidly, but I'm sure I am triggering something.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The questions above are most critical, but while I'm at it... How to convert Korean characters to their Chinese equivalents (the Hanja key).\n\n\n\n\nA: OK, I started to figure it out. Part of it was related to installation issues. Mainly, a logout is required before the IME is functional!\nHow to completely uninstall/disable Korean input: I uninstalled Nabi the same way I installed it: via Ubuntu Software Center. Languages can be enabled/disabled via \"System Settings\" > \"Language Support\". \nHow to identify which IME I'm using: I uninstalled Nabi, so now I'm pretty sure IBus is the IME being used.\nHow to tell which input mode the IME is currently in (Korean Hangul or English 'Roman'): The IME does overlay a status panel above other windows. However, it won't be enabled/visible until after a logout. The IBus keyboard icon in the panel also changes to a Korean-design icon when in Korean Hangul input mode.\nHow to switch between Korean Hangul mode and English 'Roman' mode: The keyboard shortcuts are configurable from IBus preferences. By default, Ctrl - Space. The keyboard short-cuts do not work until after a logout has been made.\n... and I guess the random switching to Korean mode was a bug because the IME was in a weird state before logout.\n", "Q: How can I take a screenshot of the login screen?

No need to log out.\n\nA: For Ubuntu with GDM3 as display manager\nI adapted the answers given by @Niroshan, @Parto and @sdaau to work on recent versions of Ubuntu like 19.04 (Disco Dingo) and 20.04 (Focal Fossa). It's a really simple process, as shown below.\nFirst, you will have to install the imagemagick package which has all the programs that'll be used in a script to take the shot.\nsudo apt install imagemagick\n\nSecond, you will need to create a file and paste the contents of the script that  change the virtual console to the gdm3 tty, wait 10 seconds and, when the image is loaded on the screen, it takes the shot of the entire window in the desired format.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nchvt 1\nsleep 10\nDISPLAY=:0.0 \\\nXAUTHORITY=/run/user/125/gdm/Xauthority \\\nimport -window root gdm_shot.png\n\nAs you can see, the script sets the $DISPLAY variable to the display number that gdm3 is using and also sets the $XAUTHORITY variable to the file used by gdm3 to gain access to its X server. It's a little different from the previous answers because gdm3 changed its display number and the place where it stores its Xauthority file. That was a little tricky to find out.\nWe used the imagemagick import command instead of xwd because it not just take the shot, but converts it to .jpg or .png, for example, in one go.\nFinally, after you set the script to be executable, such as, chmod +x gdm_screenshot.sh, you will have to logout from your current gnome-session and go to any available console(tty), pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2, for example. After that, you'll need to login and run the script as root with sudo ./gdm_screenshot.sh.\nYou'll end up with an .png image file of you GDM3 screen in the directory where you run the script.\n\nHere is the screenshot I took when I run this script for the first time.\n\n\nA: This blog might be helpful:\nhttp://ptspts.blogspot.com/2010/02/how-to-create-screen-shot-of-gdm-login.html\nInstall ImageMagick for the image file format conversion below:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nCreate a helper script:\necho 'DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=/var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth xwd -root' >/tmp/shot.sh\n\nMake sure your login screen is active (log out or reboot the machine, and wait until you see the login screen).\nLog in in text mode (by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1), or using SSH.\nCreate the screen shot by running\nsudo bash /tmp/shot.sh >/tmp/shot.xwd\n\nYou can log in now (by pressing Ctrl-AltF7 first to get back to the GDM login screen).\nConvert the screen shot to JPEG and/or PNG:\nconvert -quality 50 /tmp/shot.xwd /tmp/shot.jpg\nconvert /tmp/shot.xwd /tmp/shot.png\n\nView the screen shot in your favourite image viewer. \n\nA: For 11.10 and Lightdm and later\nYou can try running unity-greeter --test-mode in a terminal.

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI went to the shutdown icon and then system settings.\nWhen the settings screen opens, I went to 'Network' and the WiFi network with which I was connected. There is a small arrow one one side of the name of the network.\n\nClick that icon and you should see an option called \"settings\" or \"options\" (or something similar) here: \n\nWhen the next window opens, simply go to the 'General' tab and you should see an option that gives you an option to Automatically connect to a VPN.

I hope it works for everyone else too.\nDoesn't require any sort of text editor or code editor or anything.. \n\nA: The solution suggested by con-f-use should work but doesn't, due to a long-standing bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/280571\nThere are workarounds though. For recent NetworkManager versions, there is a commandline utitility, nmcli, that can be edited and saved as something like /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/vpn-up:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nREQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME=\"<name-of-connection>\"\nVPN_CONNECTION_NAME=\"<name-of-vpn-connection>\"\n\n\nactiv_con=$(nmcli con status | grep \"${REQUIRED_CONNECTION_NAME}\")\nactiv_vpn=$(nmcli con status | grep \"${VPN_CONNECTION_NAME}\")\nif [ \"${activ_con}\" -a ! \"${activ_vpn}\" ];\nthen\n    nmcli con up id \"${VPN_CONNECTION_NAME}\"\nfi\n\n[I haven't tested this -- please feel free to test and edit according to results]\nSee:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Use_dispatcher_to_connect_to_a_VPN_after_a_network_connection_is_established has more info.\n\nA: You can find VPN auto-connect option in the nm-connection-editor GUI in the individual saved Wi-Fi settings. In Ubuntu 14.04 you can find it under:\nSystem settings -> Network -> Wi-Fi or Lan -> Settings (General tab) -> Auto connect to VPN...\n(Since Gnome 42, this path leads to a new simplified menu, but the complete one can still be accessed through nm-connection-editor directly)\n\nAfter saving, a secondaries= line is added in your configuration file in the [connection] section.  It will contain a list of secondary connection UUIDs to be activated. The configuration file is usually /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/.\nThis information can be useful if you need to activate more than one secondary connection. You can add multiple connection UUIDs in the configuration file separated by ;, even though the GUI (at the moment: 2022) does not allow to select more than one entry.\n\nA: I was able to get this working on Ubuntu 20.04 by using nm-connection-editor. For whatever reason, the option doesn't appear anymore in neither the Wifi/Ethernet nor the VPN config UIs.\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n\n*Type nm-connection-editor\n\n\n*Select the network connection you want to auto-connect\n\n\n\n*Click the gear icon to open settings for that connection\n\n\n*Go to the General tab\n\n\n*Enable the Automatically connect to VPN option and select the VPN in the dropdown menu to the right\n\n\n\n*Click Save\n\nA: You don't need any dispatcher scripts any more ! In 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) you just have to take the following steps after setting the autoconnect option in the NetworkManager GUI.\nStore the vpn-secrets plainly in the config file for the VPN-connection under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/YourVPNConnectionName. \nYou can achieve this by setting IPSec secret-flags=0 and Xauth password-flags=0 in the config file. Then go to the NetworkManager GUI and save again you VPN-connection settings. Now a section called [vpn-secrets] should be present in the config file.

However, in 11.04, if I try this, the keyboard switching hot key appears to be disabled once I have clicked on the titlebar. I understand that I can use keyboard shortcuts or right click the titlebar, to move a window to a specific workspace.

Among other things, it can give hints for what the best move would be for your current situation. You can also choose the difficulty, so you can start at a low level, and after you've beaten your computer a couple of times move up to a stronger opponent.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can try using gnome-chess \nA screenshot:\n\n\nA: glchess\nTo install glchess in Ubuntu 14.04-16.04 open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install glchess\n\n\n\nA: I would suggest Chessmaster even though it isn't free and only has a bronze raiting on WineHQ, because of the tutorials/lessons by Josh Waitzkin that are really awesome, especially for beginners.\n\n\nA: I'm cheating here... But I would recommend Sparkchess or sparkchess.com. The free version is web-based, and doesn't have too many features, but it's a nice interface, and the easiest AI is pretty easy (heck, even I can beat it pretty easily).\n\nA: If you like to play in temrinal, you might like http://nocheto.sallyx.org/\nIts not free, but not expensive and it is great for studying chess.\n\nA: Scid vs. PC.\nIts free and it's a great toolkit for all your chess needs.

I have been trying to get Natty to play Quake Live with no luck.\nSome notes\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing in Chrome doesn't work at all -- it seems to download the XPI (firefox plugin file)\n\n*Installing in Firefox (latest -- at the moment this is 4.0.1) doesn't work due to incompatibility with v4.0.1.\n\n*Installing in older Firefox (v3.6.17) works, but I am still unable to play. Whenever quakelive.com is loaded, the browser is redirected to the install page (even when I have the plugin installed). This is the closest I have come to actually getting it working. Although, I'm not sure if this is a dead end. Many of the people on the Quake Live forums seem to use this solution.\nAny help is appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: Fixing the problem is simple. This worked in Firefox 4.0.1 with Quake Live plugin version 1.0.433:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Quake Live and login (or sign up, then log in)\n\n*The site will try to install the plugin\n\n*Instead of allowing Firefox to install your plugin, right click on the link and save the file\n\n*Open the file using Archive Manager and right click on install.rdp and 'Open With...' your choice of editor\n\n*Modify the line containing <em:maxVersion>...</em:maxVersion> so that it reads <em:maxVersion>4.*</em:maxVersion> -- or substitute whatever version or versions you run\n\n*Add a line containing <em:unpack>true</em:unpack> inside the <Description>...</Description> tag\n\n*When you save, Archive Manager will ask if you'd like to update the archive. Click 'Update'\n\n*Fire up Firefox and click Tools -> Add-Ons -> Extensions\n\n*Click the button to the left of the Search text box (in the top right) and choose 'Install Add-on from File...'\n\n*Select the XPI file which you just modified and install it\n\n*Once finished, go to Quake Live and log in\n\n*It should begin downloading all the game data you need to play\n\n*Pick a game \n\n\nHere is where I found the fix (thanks to @fossfreedom). In case something changes or you run another version of linux/firefox, you can always follow it to get a good answer or a link to a good one.\n\nA: Scoobie - (decided to convert my comment to an answer)\nthe suggested fix in the quakelive forum should work as described here\nN.B. add the highlighted values into the XPI and change the min and max versions to 4.0 and 4.x to correspond with your Firefox version.  Try changing the max-version to \"9\" - maybe that will stop the extension braking each time Firefox is updated.\n\nA: Just unzip the QuakeLivePlugin_xxx.xpi file and copy the plugins folder to to ~./mozilla/plugins\nYou have to make hidden files inside your home directory visible (option from the explorer menu) \nWorks fine with FF5 under Linux.\n", "Q: What are common causes for greatly decreased internet speeds? Two days ago I set my computer up to dual-boot with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.04.\nOn windows 7, my download speed averages around 500kb/s, regardless of time of day.\nOn Ubuntu, downloading simple updates from the Software Centre, my average speed is about 15-20kb/s rather than 500-540kb/s which I get on Windows 7.\nI am on a wireless network.\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.\nAlso, my father is on Ubuntu 11.04 as well, and his connection speed is no slower than it was before. could that be because he's wired in to the modem itself rather than running wireless? I'm unsure of what to do to bring Ubuntu's speed on my laptop back up from the stone age to where it should be.\n\nA: It might be irrelevant, but are the Windows download speeds after using a download accelerator? I think windows did not report its download speeds for updates.\nIn case you are wondering why the software center downloads are slow, it might be because it uses wget (which does not use an accelerator) and is like downloading files using plain firefox.\nTry installing axel, apt-fast and see if that might help :\nsudo apt-get install axel\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tldm217/tahutek.net\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apt-fast\n\nAnd then use apt-fast instead of apt-get for eg. sudo apt-fast upgrade or apt-fast update.\nI cannot speak about any other reasons for slow speeds on Ubuntu, and am pretty sure that I've gotten better download speeds in Ubuntu than ever in Windows. Try taking a look at your network usage in gnome-system-monitor and see your network usage. Also since you are on a wireless network, try updating your network drivers.\n\nA: My guess it's a driver discrepancy between Windows / Ubuntu. Also a guess is Bufferbloat.\nGive this line a shot and see if anything changes:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 0\nThis tends to fix the issue of latency under heavy load - not so much raw download speed, but you may notice some improvement.\n\nA: If you want increased speed downloading 11.10, use a torrent program like 'transmission' or BitTorent.  You will get the data from multiple places (simultaneously) and your download bandwidth will be used to the max (or whatever max download speed you set).\n\nA: Try this :\nIn Firefox, go to about:config, search ipv6 and change the value of network.dns.disableIPv6 to true.\n\nA: I also tried\nhttp://www.jonboy60.com/2011/11/02/how-to-increase-internet-speed-in-ubuntu/\nI could take out the code if it didn't work anyways. I just applied the settings a few minutes ago; it seems to have sped up my connection.\nNice tip! I'm using Ubuntu 11.10. I'd recommend for anyone who has a crappy DSL connection to try it. If it doesn't work for you, just remove the extra code.\nCheers!\n*After testing for a few hours*\nOkay. I did a laptop to laptop comparison. My laptop against my wife's laptop -- both on Ubuntu 11.10 -- mine, with the tweak; hers, without -- ran both laptops on speedtest.net.\nAnd the results are... they have the same internet speed, which is why I am going to go against my earlier comment.\nWhat seems to have happened was that my ISP was erratic at the time of testing after I first added the code, and the spike I witnessed was probably a fluke.\nI'm taking the extra code out.\nPeace!\n\nA: Are you just seeing these slower download speeds when downloading from the Software Center or system updates?  Try downloading an ubuntu ISO (from the website or via bittorrent) or seeing how quickly a long youtube video takes to load.\nIf the slow downloads are just for software center / updates, you should try \"Select Best Server\", in the \"Ubuntu Software\" tab of Software Sources.  That will test your connection speed to the various servers the packages are mirrored on and select the best one.\n\nA: One thing you could try to increase your internet speed is to switch to different DNS servers. There are several great free options that you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Norton DNS. This one is currently my favorite because it is extremely fast, and faster than the other DNS servers that I have tried (for me).\n\n*OpenDNS. This one is another great DNS service, is fast, and allows various levels of protection. \n\n*Google Public DNS. This one is known mostly for its speed, but it comes with security benefits as well.\nFrom personal experience, I can say that all three of these free DNS services are great and have caused me no problems. \nTo specifically increase download speeds in the Ubuntu Software Center, you should find the best Download Server. This can be accomplished quite easily. First, go into System Settings. Next click on the Software Sources icon. Once it opens, you should be in the Ubuntu Software tab. In that tab, under the options for Downloadable from the Internet, there is a section called Download from: with a drop down menu next to it. Click on that and click Other in the list that appears. Another window should open, and now, simply press the Select Best Server button. Ubuntu will now automatically find the best download servers for you, and your download speeds for updates and programs in the Software Center should be increased.\n", "Q: Fail2ban misses some relay attempts I have some relay attempts like these in my mail.log (they total 281 connection attempts in less than 3 minutes):\nMay 16 04:58:30 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18950]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:30 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18951]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:30 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18951]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:31 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18947]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:31 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18952]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:31 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18952]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:31 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18947]: disconnect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:32 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18922]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:32 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18947]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:32 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18947]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18953]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18953]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18922]: disconnect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18948]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18949]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18922]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:33 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18922]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18948]: disconnect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18949]: disconnect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18948]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18948]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18949]: warning: xx.yy.zzz.www: hostname xx-yy-zzz-www.network.domain verification failed: No address associated with hostname\nMay 16 04:58:34 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18949]: connect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\nMay 16 04:58:35 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18950]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:35 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18951]: warning: unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]: SASL LOGIN authentication failed: authentication failure\nMay 16 04:58:35 MyServer postfix/smtpd[18950]: disconnect from unknown[xx.yy.zzz.www]\n\nI guess filter sasl (which is enabled) should take care of them, but ip is never banned.

I want to file a bug directly upstream to GNOME.\nCan someone give exact procedure for filing bugs on GNOME Bugzilla?\n\nA: Before filing a bug report, it is good to search if the bug has already been reported. This saves time and effort.\nStep 1  Identify which GNOME package you want to file the report on. This might be the most difficult item. Common packages are gtk+ (for low-level toolkit bugs), gnome-games (for any of the games) and so on. You can click on the Help»About menu to find the codename of any application.\nStep 2  Visit https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi and from the pull-down menu find the product identified in Step 1. Click on Show product.\nStep 3 Suppose you want to search for existing bugs in the Text Editor (gedit). The URL is gedit product page on Bugzilla. From here you can view a list of all open bugs, perform searches and identify anything related to issues about the application. If do find an existing report for the issue you planned to report, click to Subscribe to the bug report, so that you receive updates. \nStep 4 If you did not find a relevant bug report, click on the link File a bug in order to write a new bug report (or request for enhancement).\nThat's it!\nBonus addition If you can find a bug report in Launchpad and the corresponding bug report on GNOME's Bugzilla, you can link from Launchpad to GNOME's Bugzilla. And Launchpad will automatically follow the status of the Bugzilla report. This type of connecting reports in Launchpad to Bugzillas is very important for the Ubuntu community and helps put order in the bugs. \n\nA: For filing a bug in GNOME's bugzilla, look at these instructions from the ubuntu bug team. There are also some tips for how to report bugs on other bugzillas:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream/GNOME\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream\nHere are instructions on how to use Bugzilla itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.4/en/html/using.html\n", "Q: where can I buy a Lenovo X220 with ubuntu preinstalled? this link here: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/make/Lenovo states \"Pre-installed only\" for the X220 leading me to believe I can buy this model with Ubuntu preinstalled. I've been unable to find such an option at Lenovo's website.\n\nA: I looked around and there isn't a lot of info on that.  It does appear that Canonical's collaboration with Lenovo is very recent, with the press announcement dated May 9, 2011, so hopefully Lenovo systems with Ubuntu will start appearing soon.\nThat said, I did find one vendor that will preinstall Ubuntu on the X220 HERE. \n\nA: This may not help you but I say it anyway.\nI'm sitting in front of an X220i student model (this is german but it doesn't matter for the components) right now.\nI live in Germany and Lenovo has a special student programme here. So they sell Thinkpads with special configurations and really low prices and without operation system.\nI installed Ubuntu 11.04 and everything just worked out of the box. So I can really recommend this notebook.\nI don't know where you live but if you have a friend who is student in Germany, you may want to visit him now ;) ... or the other way round. But pay attention on not making it look like smuggling :D\n\nA: Try the Raven X220 family \n", "Q: Where's the \"log out\" option after clicking the power icon? So the documentation says:\n\nTo log out or switch users, click the\n  power icon on the top bar and select\n  the appropriate option.\n\nHowever, I cannot see the \"log out\" option. All I see are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock Screen\n\n*Switch from ubuntu\n\n*Suspend\n\n*Restart...\n\n*Shut Down \n\n*System settings\n\n\nI managed to log out via a terminal command. Any way to log out via the Unity GUI or add this option to the power icon menu?\nupdate: I'm running from a live USB.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open gconf-editor (press Alt + F2, type gconf-editor, press Enter)\n\n\n*Navigate to /apps/indicator-session/\n\n\n*Make sure none of the checkboxes on the right pane are ticked:\n\nHowever, it would be interesting to know why that happened (maybe worth reporting a bug).\n", "Q: Black screen except for mouse cursor on Thinkpad Edge 15 After not using the computer for a few hours, I return and see a black/blank screen.\nI see the mouse cursor. It responds to movements and it changes state as if the windows are there (changing to text or 'link thumb').\nBut all I see is a black screen. Anyone knows anything about this?\n\nA: I occasionally have the same issue. \nTry hitting Alt+F2 and then typing unity --replace.\n\nA: Have you tried restarting your window manager? \nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm start\nIf that is the case, as you suggested in the comments it may be a memory leak or something with Compiz?\n\nA: I had to disable the screensaver on my Thinkpad Edge 13 to solve a similar (same?) problem.\n\nA: I think we nailed this one.\nYou need to go to a tty shell (with no ui) by using, for example, ctrl+alt+F2.\nIn the tty shell, you need to login and find any compiz process, using the command\nps -ef | grep compix\n\nThen, kill all the compiz processes:\nkill -9 <processes ids separated using space>\n\nThen run unity to initialize the UI:\nunity&\n\nGive it a moment to load and go back to the 'UI shell', using ctrl+alt+F8, to see the UI being initialized.\n\nA: Another option (Can help a freeze - not just a black screen):\nGo to a tty shell (with no ui) by using, for example, ctrl+alt+F2.\nJust kill the compiz process (not compiz-decorator) - The UI will restart itself.\nIdentifying process id:\nps -ef | grep compix\n\nKilling the process:\nkill -9 <processes id>\n\nGo back to the 'UI shell' (ctrl+alt+F7) - the UI will restart.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 13.04, the following may help when you have a black screen and a mouse pointer or some other indication/knowledge that you are running the lightdm desktop manager that ships with Unity.\nOpen up TTY1 by typing Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or F2 for TTY2, etc).\nLog in, then enter:\nsudo restart lightdm\n\n", "Q: Wine programs (Steam and Football Manager) don't work after upgrade Since upgrading to Natty some programs using wine don't work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Steam\n\n*Football Manager 2011\n\n\nI've tried reinstalling and they both crash. I have tried Wine 1.3 and it still doesn't work.\nI get the error: \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/610185/\nThis is using wine version 1.2.\n\nA: Unity completely wrecks the Wine user experience in several important ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz (desktop effects) is required, and Compiz often messes with Wine\n\n*The Application Lens does not show any subfolders or allow the user to filter by wine apps, making finding them in the big alphabetical mess of a list difficult.\n\n*Most Wine apps show the Wine icon rather than their icon in the dock.\n\n\nThis happened because Unity was not designed with Wine users in mind.  At all.  This is partially my fault, as I was a bit busy this cycle and should have been shouting from the rooftops to get Wine users noticed, but I was a bit busy with personal life and barely managed to get the system tray not intentionally broken.\nThat said, your specific application issue is probably not Unity-related.  I will be putting out a new Wine1.2 release soon and issuing a stable release update for Natty, however in the meantime I would encourage you to try Wine1.3 (\"Beta release\" in Software Center) or the Wine PPA.\n\nA: It might be due to the newer version of Wine (1.2.2) in Natty Narwhal. In Maverick Meerkat came with Wine version 1.2. It has nothing to do with Unity.\n\nA: Ok I got it working. \nIf you get the error shown in the original post, find and save the listed .dll files to: ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32.\n\n\n*\n\n*gameux.dll\n\n*import.dll\n\n*duser.dll\n\n\nA: Are you able to disable the 3D somehow?\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=21720\n", "Q: How to find the command of an installed application? I have an installed application, but I don't know its name. (By \"name\" I mean what I would type in a command line.)\nIs there any way to see this? It seems so obvious, but I can't figure it out.\n\nA: If the installed application has installed a menu option, then right-click the menu at the top of the screen and choose Edit Menus.  If you are using Natty, type \"alacarte\" in the terminal\nNavigate to the menu option and choose the Properties button - you'll then see the command to launch your application.\n\n\nA: If it is a package installed from repos, or through a deb package, try the command:\ndpkg -L package-name | grep /bin\n\n\nA: The way I occasionally do that is to launch Synaptic Package Manager, find the package with the app I installed, and look into it's properties, at the list of installed files this package contains. Most exacutables land to /usr/bin, so I look for files installed in that directory, and that's what you need to run.\nFor example, I installed liblo-tools package. Now I see the following in installed files list:\n...\n/usr\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/oscdump\n/usr/bin/oscsend\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/doc\n...\n\nThat means I can run oscsend or oscdump commands to run appropriate liblo proggrams.\nNote: Some apps will install their programs to other directories, but that's rare. For example, games may install it's executables to /usr/games instead of /usr/bin\n\nA: Try typing the name of the application along with using TAB. If the application is in the path then you can able to see that. \n\nA: Go under Administration / Synaptic, and go to your Package. Right click to open Properties. Here you can see all the files that this package has installed. \nThe binary (aka executable) files are usually found under /usr/bin.\n\nA: If your application were an RSS reader, for example, 'man -k rss' or 'man -k feed' might yield some ideas, as would 'apropos rss'.\n\nA: What I do is Applications > [application you're looking for], right-click, select 'Add this launcher to panel'. The icon will appear on the panel from which you can right-click it and select Properties. It'll show the command there.\nThis probably only works for the old Gnome UI but I thought I'd still share anyway. You may be able to do something similar on Unity, I'm not sure.\n", "Q: How to replace python-gtkhtml2? I would like to install under Lucid the restructured text plugin for gedit, but it fails as it can't import gtkhtml2. Previously it was provided by the python-gtkhtml2 package, but it's not compatible with python2.6.\nIs there any recent package that is backwards compatible with gtkhtml2 and could be easily put in place of the old import line? Or any other solution you know?\n\nA: Savvas Radevic (medigeek) wrote on 2010-06-13: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnochm/+bug/538773\n", "Q: How do I install XULRunner since it's a requeriment for Pencil? I'm installing Pencil and get the following error: xulrunner: not found. XULRunner is a a requirement for Pencil. So how do I install XULRunner and it's dependencies?\n\nA: You can actually run xulrunner apps without installing xulrunner, and just using firefox.\nIf you look on https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner, it says:\n\nFirefox 3 and later ships with a private XULRunner package, which can run any compatible XULRunner application using the -app switch.\n\nSo I just untarred the pencil .tar.gz distribution, navigated into the user/share/pencil (or whatever) directory, and did:\nfirefox -app application.ini\n\ntada!  No additional installations needed.\n\nA: You need to install one of the packages xulrunner-1.9.2 or xulrunner-2.0, depending on which version of xulrunner you need.\n\nA: Though late but anyone that stubles here, you don't need to download XULRunner anymore. just download their deb from their site and you are good to go.\nIts working with Raring fine!\n\nA: You can install the latest source of XULRuner by executing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xulrunner-2.0 xulrunner-2.0-dev xulrunner-2.0-gnome-support xulrunner-dev\n\nOnce installed you'll need to update-alternatives so it's used by default:\nsudo update-alternatives --config xulrunner \n\nBe careful that this ppa also contains an updated version of firefox and thunderbird.\n\nA: There's no longer a recent package available.\nFrom https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Getting_started_with_XULRunner\nPut the following in a file and run it.

What could be the problem of that?\nThanks in advance,\nDanny\n\nA: I looked up your account and see that your account is on the server that was experiencing high loads the past few days. We have this under better control now and file sync performance should be much better, including your small file being synced successfully rather than the sync continually being reset.\n\nA: Workaround: I've had a very similar experience to this one.

The tranfer completes fine. I then do a safely remove (have also tried eject and unmount), but never do all the files copy, even though the transfer completes without error.\nWhen I plug the card back in and view the contents, the main directory structure is there, but the folders inside are empty (no files). Why?\nI have tried different microSD cards.\nIts like Ubuntu is copying the files into my RAM instead (I'm guessing), or some other cache, and even though I do a safe removal, the files I've copied are not all there. The majority of files in sub-folders are missing.\nRunning Ubuntu 11.04 updated.\n\nA: A SD is slower than a regular USB flash drive. After pressing \"Eject\" or \"Unmount\", make sure that buffers are written before the drive is removed.\nTo be sure that the buffers are flushed before you remove the drive, open a terminal and run:\nsudo umount /media/YourSdCard\n\nAfter the program is done and returned to the prompt, you can safely remove it. Alternatively, run sync and wait until it's completed. After that, use \"Eject\" or \"Unmount\" and remove the SD card.\n", "Q: My Lenovo Ideapad u165 wireless doesn't work  It really makes me ANGRY !  my wireless hardware is broadcom 4313 . ubuntu install it automatically but I can't use it .

I have long relied on Alt+Tab to cycle through applications.\nSince upgrading to Unity in Ubuntu 11.04, I found that Alt+Tab has been very slow. Today, I found that Super+W, followed by arrow keys and Enter replaces this functionality and is more responsive.\nHas Super+W made Alt+Tab obsolete?\n\nA: Alt+Tab isn't slow, it's just that by default there's a 0.2 second delay, I imagine so that a quick Alt+Tab won't get slower by creating thumbnails of windows or altering window opacities or things like that.\nOpen CompizConfig Settings Manager (ccsm) (install if not already installed), open the Static Application Switcher plugin config, go to the Behaviour tab and fiddle with the value of Popup Window Delay. \nIt's 0.2 seconds by default which I found to be too slow. You can set it to 0 if you want it to be instant, or some slightly larger value as desired - after some experimentation, I settled on 0.05 seconds, which means that a quick Alt+Tab to switch to the next doesn't start hiding the other windows or opening the window switcher panel but just goes straight to the next application (this is particularly useful for comparing the contents of two windows without the flicker of the window switcher which I always used to get back when I worked on XP), but if I want to switch to any other window and want to see what I'm going to, there's no discernible delay.\n\nA: \nHas Super+W made Alt+Tab obsolete?\n\nAlt+Tab is still the fastest way to switch to and fro quickly (between a small number of windows that is). Especially if you're working with only two. I do about five Alt+Tabs before I do one +W ←↑→↓ Enter or +W OmgWhereAmI Mouse Point Mouse Click. Not to mention that it's a quasi-cross-platform semi-standard adapted by many a distro, display manager and OS.\nSo short answer: No.\nAt least for me. They both have their uses and complement each other.\nAs for the slow Alt+Tab:\nChris Morgan pointed out in his answer here (please credit him for that, I just improved on the form) how to solve that problem. In shell or per link ccsm :\n sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen proceed as shown in screenshot:\n\n\nA: Don't look at it like one is substituting the other. Think of it like Super+W is an alternative to Alt+Tab when handling multiple windows. Alt+Tab is still quicker for 2 to 3 windows.\nA quick Alt+Tab for them and you are done. For more than 2 or 3 depending on the user, Super+W is faster since you can directly select the window you want and visualize it while doing it.\nFor the comments above Remember that:\nSuper+W - Select Opened Windows\nSuper+D - Go to Desktop (Minimize All)\nAlt+Tab - Select from a group of opened windows\nNOTE - They will sometimes not work (For example the Super combinations and their effects) but if anybody noticed, there has been more updates since Ubuntu 11.04 was released than the same amount of time for any other previous Ubuntu version. This somehow tells everyone the work that the Ubuntu Devs and community are putting into getting an excellent product. So be patient and most if not all of this tiny problems will be solved soon enough.\n\nA: I had the same issue, not being able to switch tasks with x+Tab.  Have Logitech USV keyboard, not shared with a KVM Switch.  Curiously there is an 'F-Lock' button, (controlling standard F1, F2, etc or OEM pre-programmed stuff.  \nOnce I turned off F Lock, Ctrl+Tab allowed me to tab between tabs in Firefox... but nothing else.\n", "Q: Why isn't my audio working? Why isn't my audio working in 11.04? If anyone knows, how can I fix it?\n\nA: Be more specific. That could have a 100 causes. What do your logs say? What do the sound preferences say? Does your soundcard show in the device list? Is the problem limited to a few applications or a certain filetype / pysical output on your pc? Have you upgraded your system or is it freshly installed?

Is it possible to run Ubuntu in JSLinux  ?\nHere is today's Slashdot post about JSLinux. \n\nA: No. JSLinux only implements a cpu, interrupt controller, interrupt timer and a serial port. That is quite far from the Ubuntu Hardware Requirements, such as a hard drive, graphics card etc.\nIf you had lots of time, you could probably create a suitable image based on Ubuntu, but it would be too far from the regular Ubuntu experience to be called an Ubuntu remix. See the trademark policy.\n", "Q: Gnome Do Banshee plugin? I have uninstalled Rhythmbox and installed Banshee. In Gnome-do there was this nice feature of browsing your music files with the Rhythmbox-plugin. So, on the Gnome-do plugin Wiki I could see that a Banshee-plugin exists.\nOn Launchpad, specifically on this site I downloaded a tar.gz, where I could also see a Banshee-plugin after unpacking. When I downloaded gnome-do-plugins via Software Centre there was no Banshee-plugin to activate in Gnome-do's preferences. So, is there any way I could install this plugin from that tar.gz or any other way to install it?\n\nA: If you have the source it usually contains README and INSTALL to guide you through installation process.\nBasically untar the source and cd to the folder\n./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install \n\nis the most know way of building and installing from source.\nAlso some source may have install scripts like install.sh which would make it much more easier as in the case of above link. You may try running sh install.sh as well. \n\nA: I've found a solution for my problem: Due to the fact I was using Banshee 2.0.1 it wasn't possible for Gnome-do to communicate. Therefore I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*deinstalled Banshee 2.0.1 at first\n\n*deleted all the Banshee files in my home directory\n\n*uninstalled Gnome-do\n\n*also deleted files in home, especially in .local/share/ and in .gconf/\n\n*rebooted\n\n*installed Banshee FIRST (important!!!)\n\n*then installed Gnome-do\n\n\nNow Gnome-do displays the Banshee-plugin correctly, so I do not need to install it manually.\n", "Q: Why do the installed and most recent version numbers of Gwibber differ?

Yet when I open Gwibber in Natty, it lists the version installed as 3.0.0.1 \nIs this an Ubuntu specific version or is the site out of date? \n\nA: Some information on Gwibber's website appears to be outdated. The latest blog post, titled Introducing Gwibber 2.30, was written in April 2010.\nIf you click the Download link on their site you'll see that they refer visitors to version 3.0 for source code releases and to Ubuntu's repository (which also happens to be version 3.0) for packaged releases.\n", "Q: How to configure automatic reboot after kernel panic? Now, it's the first time I encountered a kernel panic on a system that I can only access remotely (i.e. not physical access). The kernel panic I encountered is basically the one described here, only that the kernel version was:\nPid: 15483, comm: kvm Not tainted 2.6.32-30-server #59-Ubuntu MS-7522\n\nThe system is an Ubuntu 10.04 and I've been using ksplice in order to keep it secure without reboots.\nThe whole panic obviously resulted effectively in an unresponsive system. Since it runs VMs, this is not acceptable. Now, my question is this: is there a way to configure the system (e.g. via sysctl.conf) to reboot automatically when it encounters a kernel panic? If there is such an option, but it is not recommended to use it, please provide pointers or information as to why it is not recommended so I can male a well-informed decision whether to use it or refrain from using it.\nFor your reference, below the excerpt from syslog:\nBUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)\nIP: [<ffffffffa0339e6a>] gfn_to_rmap+0x2a/0x80 [kvm]\nPGD 182eff067 PUD 2103cd067 PMD 0 \nOops: 0000 [#1] SMP \nlast sysfs file: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\nCPU 2 \nModules linked in: btrfs zlib_deflate crc32c libcrc32c ufs qnx4 hfsplus hfs minix ntfs vfat msdos fat jfs xfs exportfs reiserfs ksplice_a2zjpxfc ksplice_aeduoyr1 ksplice_ocpqubki ksplice_koav9q4r_vmlinux_new ksplice_koav9q4r ksplice_6rzac0n3_vmlinux_new ksplice_6rzac0n3 ksplice_sqv65gpe ksplice_74bgebjk ksplice_l13a9izo_vmlinux_new ksplice_l13a9izo ksplice_51l2thd5_vmlinux_new ksplice_51l2thd5 ksplice_mzqhwd6a ksplice_0k98nifa_vmlinux_new ksplice_0k98nifa ksplice_c0g8d8te_vmlinux_new ksplice_c0g8d8te ksplice_6jvv7tl8_vmlinux_new ksplice_6jvv7tl8 ksplice_o2xegqal ksplice_r7xdx1no ksplice_ly8vh9y3_vmlinux_new ksplice_ly8vh9y3 nls_cp437 ip6table_filter ip6_tables kvm_intel kvm bridge stp nls_utf8 cifs ipt_LOG ipt_MASQUERADE ipt_REJECT xt_recent xt_state xt_tcpudp iptable_filter iptable_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack_ipv4 nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv4 xt_multiport ip_tables x_tables fbcon tileblit font bitblit softcursor snd_hda_intel vga16fb vgastate snd_hda_codec snd_hwdep nouveau snd_pcm ttm snd_timer snd drm_kms_helper soundcore snd_page_alloc drm lp i2c_algo_bit parport multipath linear aacraid 3w_9xxx 3w_xxxx raid10 raid456 async_pq async_xor xor async_memcpy async_raid6_recov raid6_pq async_tx raid1 raid0 ahci r8169 mii sata_nv sata_sil sata_via [last unloaded: ksplice_a2zjpxfc_ocfs2_new]\nPid: 15483, comm: kvm Not tainted 2.6.32-30-server #59-Ubuntu MS-7522\nRIP: 0010:[<ffffffffa0339e6a>]  [<ffffffffa0339e6a>] gfn_to_rmap+0x2a/0x80 [kvm]\nRSP: 0018:ffff88014ee4d828  EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 400000000001ec15 RCX: ffff8801d5e28990\nRDX: 0000000000000023 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: 0000000000000000\nRBP: ffff88014ee4d838 R08: 0000000000000023 R09: 0000000000000100\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000007 R12: 0000000000000001\nR13: 00000000000ba08a R14: ffff880032c0dbb0 R15: ffff88014ee4d928\nFS:  00007f1b0d201700(0000) GS:ffff880008e40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000158378000 CR4: 00000000000026f0\nDR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\nDR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000ffff0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\nProcess kvm (pid: 15483, threadinfo ffff88014ee4c000, task ffff88000d274500)\nStack:\n ffff8800b418d0a8 ffff8801d5e28000 ffff88014ee4d868 ffffffffa0339f5f\n<0> ffff8801d5e28000 ffffc90016afa8a8 fff0000000000fff 000000018849a000\n<0> ffff88014ee4d8b8 ffffffffa033a4cf 0000000000000001 ffff8800b418d0a8\nCall Trace:\n [<ffffffffa0339f5f>] rmap_remove+0x9f/0x1c0 [kvm]\n [<ffffffffa033a4cf>] kvm_set_pte_rmapp+0xff/0x170 [kvm]\n [<ffffffffa033653d>] kvm_handle_hva+0x9d/0x120 [kvm]\n [<ffffffffa033a3d0>] ? kvm_set_pte_rmapp+0x0/0x170 [kvm]\n [<ffffffffa0336601>] kvm_set_spte_hva+0x21/0x30 [kvm]\n [<ffffffff8155e2ce>] ? _spin_lock+0xe/0x20\n [<ffffffffa0322aa4>] kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte+0x44/0x60 [kvm]\n [<ffffffff81130e3e>] __mmu_notifier_change_pte+0x3e/0x90\n [<ffffffff811172a4>] do_wp_page+0x674/0x850\n [<ffffffff81095228>] ? tick_dev_program_event+0x68/0xd0\n [<ffffffff8108a059>] ? __hrtimer_start_range_ns+0x189/0x400\n [<ffffffff81117c2c>] handle_mm_fault+0x2ec/0x3c0\n [<ffffffff81113846>] ? follow_page+0x2d6/0x350\n [<ffffffff81117e39>] __get_user_pages+0x139/0x480\n [<ffffffffa033de1e>] ?

Make sure you have some way of monitoring your uptime so that you know when kernel panics have occurred.\n", "Q: Why is there a size discrepancy when copying from HFS+ to Ext4? I'm copying over a bunch of files from an HFS+ volume to my Ext4 Ubuntu file system. They're all movie files. When I copy one over, it nearly always gets 4K larger. The copied file is exactly 4,096 bytes larger than the original.\nI'm assuming this is because some metadata of some sort is being added, but what is it exactly?\nAlso, out of 600 files, two of them didn't grow in size. They're exactly the same. Why would this be?\n\nA: I don't know. But this is normal.\nYou can try to look at the files with du:\ndu -c *.mov\ndu -c --apparent-size *.mov\n\nThe first command will tell the Disk Usage (how much space is occupied on disk).\nThe second will show the actual size of the data (independent of where the file is stored).\n\nA: I would guess that the two filesystems have different block sizes. A block is a storage unit that allows for some abstraction by the filesystem for tracking allocation of space. A single block is the minimum unit of storage; a filesystem that uses 4K blocks will use a 4K block to store a 1K file. More small blocks require more disk space for metadata. The optimal block size will vary depending upon the typical file size, the total capacity of the storage media, and the filesystem used. Modern filesystems will choose a reasonable block size, given the latter two factors; a sysadmin may tweak the block size or chooseb a filesystem given her expectations for the use of the filesystem.\nSo, the two filesystems may have different block sizes because the disks are different sizes, or because the two different file systems have different schemes for optimizing block sizes, most likely because of different handling of metadata. The two files that didn't take up an extra 4K may have been just small enough to take up one less block each.\n", "Q: how to make byobu start with terminator by default?

Some are partitioned. Most mount automatically at boot (all did at one point).\nOne partition is owned by root and therefore does not mount automatically. I know how to mount it as root.\nI do not know how to take ownership of that partition as user X. I have tried changing permissions using the gui in Nautilus as root. They are not accepted and immediately revert.\nThe partition is NTFS. The other partition on that drive is owned by me as user and mounts automatically.\n\nA: All my NTFS partitions are owned by root, yet I can access them fine as user. It's a matter of mount options rather than ownership and file permissions (remember, it's a NTFS partition - you can't change any permissions there).\nIn my /etc/fstab the partitions are included as follows:\nUUID=AB84274F84211B98   /media/WIN7     ntfs   defaults  0   0\nUUID=CDBAF39E13A2AC2D   /media/DATA     ntfs   defaults  0   0\nUUID=EFA980B33BA33DF5   /media/MEDIA    ntfs   defaults  0   0\n\nwhere defaults are default mount options that already should do what you want to do.\nTo find the UUIDs, run sudo blkid.\nSee also: How do I use 'chmod' on an NTFS (or FAT32) partition?\n\nA: Did you try\nsudo chown user:user\n\nFor example sudo chown cyrex:cyrex (User:Group)\nif the partition is called party, your user is called cyrex and it is in /media just do for example:\nsudo chown cyrex:cyrex /media/cyrex/party -R (The R is for recursive so it affects all directory/files and subdirectory.\nAs noted, the partition is NTFS so if is automatically mounted you need to make sure that the user that has permission is you. To do this follow this steps:\n\n*\n\n*Go to console (gnome-terminal)\n\n\n*Type id -u. This should give you the user id you have which you will insert into fstab.\n\n\n*Open fstab sudo /etc/fstab and search for the line that is mounting the ntfs partition.\n\n\n*Assuming it is something like this:\nUUID=1234532123 /media/amntfs  ntfs  defaults 0       0\n\nAdd to it the umask, uid and gid masks like this\nUUID=1234532123 /media/amntfs  ntfs   defaults,umask=007,uid=1000,gid=1000  0       0\nSave the file and just reboot or remount the unit.\nHere:\n\n*\n\n*The uid is your User ID. The one you got from id -u.\n\n*The gid is you Group ID. Normally the same as id -u but you can check it with id -g.\n\n*The umask is like chown but reversed.\n\nSee How do I use 'chmod' on an NTFS (or FAT32) partition? on more about using chmod/chown on NTFS filesystems.\nNTFS and POSIX Compatibility\nIt is correct to think that NTFS is not 100% POSIX compatible. But it is also true that NTFS is POSIX conformant, meaning it is similar but not exact to the POSIX that is used in Linux. As you read my answer you find 2 things here:\n\n*\n\n*I target changing permissions on the NTFS files\n\n*I target changing permission at the mounting level or while mounting in the fstab.\n\nFor the mounting level it is pretty straightforward there. It is in the file permission as described above that, if analyzed, it really does not make sense and should not be working. But the thing is a bit more complicated. So here is the rundown as a technician on Windows in the 90s and a Linux user since 2001.\nWhen you mount an NTFS filesystem (at least on Ubuntu), NTFS-3G takes care of the proper mounting for it and even offers mapping capabilities to make sure that the instructions in regards to permissions are mapped from Linux to the NTFS filesystem correctly. Meaning, if I do chmod or chown, they would work.\nThis is only half of the answer. The other is that NTFS is conformant with POSIX or you could say \"compatible\" to a certain degree, but as far as I can recall, it is for version 1 of POSIX, I think called POSIX.1 from the 1990s and only for a certain subset of the windows subsystem.\nSo, between NTFS-3G and the \"compatibility\" of NTFS with POSIX, you are in fact able to use chmod on the NTFS files and folders.\nI can not say anything about newer versions of NTFS on Windows 8.1, 10, 11 or future versions about how they are POSIX compatible, but I can talk about the current one and experience I have about the background for NTFS, POSIX and how they relate in a very weird way when talking about Windows.\nMinor Update: starting on Kernel 5.15 (Oct 31, 2021), there is a new NTFS implementation as read HERE  where it shows enhancements on how we deal with NTFS.\n\nA: If you mount a partition to a folder within /home/user it will be owned by the user. Here's the line I added to my /etc/fstab.\nUUID=9e5bb53c-4443-4124-96a8-baeb804da204 /home/fragos/Data ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\n\nA: I was having a hard time solving the problem and this solution worked for me\n\n*\n\n*install physical storage device manger:\nsudo apt-get install pysdm\n\n\n\n*open storage device manger:\nsudo pysdm\n\n\n\n*choose your required drives\n\n\n*press assisst\n\n\n*uncheck open as read only\n\n\n*check owner user of file system and write your username\n\n\n*press ok\n\n\n*press apply\n\n\n*umount the drive\n\n\n*mount it\nNote:\nif you can't change files to binary executables, go to special files and check permit execution of files as binaries, and go to step 7\n\nA: The easiest  is to in terminal open file manager with sudo i.e.\nsudo nemo or sudo nautilus or what ever file manager you are using, then right click on the partition and add permissions.\n\nA: This is what I did on Ubuntu to automatically set ownership of a partition:\n\n*\n\n*Find and launch Disks app\n\n*Select the storage disk and select the partition.\n\n*Click the option button and select edit mount options...\n\n*Switch off Defaults\n\n*append uid=1000,gid=1000 to the listed mount options.\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Unmount and remount the partition and you are done.\n\nIf you want to grant execution permission to executable files, just add exec to the option list.\n", "Q: \"weird\" Google Chrome feature, huge address bar pops up I am quite puzzled by this feature since it just seems off.\nWhen I press Ctrl + }* and I'm not in a text box.\n*(basically the key below the +, left of Enter) \nI get this:\n\nA huge address bar where I can type (in this case I had typed google.com - it's not by default).

The default crontab checks if anacron is installed, and runs the mentioned schedules if anacron is missing from /usr/sbin/.\nTo be absolutely sure, you could do a soft removal by just stopping the anacron service with service anacron stop and remove test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || from the lines in /etc/crontab.

I currently have a dual boot system with 6 partitions on my 180GB hard disk (4 NTFS, 1 for swap and the other one ext4). Ive got WIndows 7 and Ubuntu 11.04 (upgraded from 10.10) installed. \nThe 11.04 installation is messed up right now: missing dependencies/ 2 fglrx installs/ i have to manually mount every drive in order to use it/plymouth extremely messed up...\n Anyway I spent hours and hours fixing stuff or making them worse. \nI now prefer to do a clean natty install. The problem arose: The installer sees my hard drive as 180GB of unallocated space. It doesnt detect any partitions, any other OSs and my only option is to format my whole drive, but I cant do that with all the important files and such.\nIs there some way I can just format the current Ubuntu partition and install Natty there?

Clearly my HDD is messed up so I decided to delete at least one partition that I do not plan on using.(I thought maybe that a change in the physical drive will update the partition table or something) Another problem: That did not work and it gave me the following error: \"Cant have overlapping partitions.\" I googled this and it looks like a very bad thing....

That said, Unity is still very buggy and was quite unusable to me. I would suggest switching back to the default desktop until unity is stable enough to be used 24/7.

So I almost HAVE to use this to wifi transfer my export folder.\n\nA: I improved the python script given by user: \"Арсений Пичугин\" so that it preserves the directory structure when copying files to a new location. This allows you to then copy .m3u file and the target music files to a new device, and the links will not be broken, so the playlist will actually PLAY, like on your mp3-player or phone.

My hp probook has vga and hdmi outs... the vga and the onboard display run through the same channel. You can use Hdmi with either vga or onboard display. The only way i have seen to run all 3 is by adding a usb display adapter allowing extra monitors but it really draws on the system pushing your graphics card pretty hard. I was hoping to find a way to actually run all 3 since ubuntu is quite a bit more giving than windows... So if you want to get VGA and HDMI to work together... close your lid (but you may need to change your power settings to do nothing when closing the lid...) when you close it vga will come online when you open it vga will go off and your internal will come on unless you have it set to off in the monitor settings. GL\n\nA: What James Henstridge explains as a comment is probably what is going on here, although I didn't find any details on the hardware specifics for this laptop mode.\n\nI would suggest trying con-f-use's suggestion too. While the laptop\n  has multiple outputs, it won't necessarily have enough clock\n  generators to drive them all at the same time (for example, one video\n  card I had could only drive one of its DVI and HDMI outputs at a\n  time). If you've got two monitors, it will be quickest to just try it\n  out. – James Henstridge May 19 '11 at 1:47\n\n\nA: The above solution of using Displays in System Settings to setup a dual monitor configuration works perfectly in Ubuntu 13.10. I'm using an Acer Aspire One netbook (it's old from 2009) with an integrated Intel GMA 3150 (also old) and an analog CRT (even older) external Samsung monitor. And I have only one video device listed which is Intel's GMA.\nNow here's the trade-off:\nIf your external monitor has a different resolution you'll have to decide which monitor will be used for resolution purposes. In my case the CRT is only 800x600 whereas my netbook is 1200x600 but this works for what i want which is to see videos on the CRT. (My netbook is only 1200x600 so a little tiny!)\nAfter using the CRT I just have to open Displays again from System Settings and revert to the original configuration of only 1 monitor instead of 2 mirrored.\nI know many people will want to use a dual non-mirrored configuration but there is people like me that just want to use another monitor so that answer is very good for that purpose!\nMany thanks con-f-use for that simple answer!\nI've changed from Windows 7 Starter to Ubuntu 13.10 and i'm loving it! (I won't go back now!)\n\nA: You can (and should) just try it, as has been suggested, but your chances are slim, not to say null.  Just like your switching graphics can't be used together, laptop designers make it so you can only use one of your VGA/DVI/HDMI outputs at a time (since it's a lot cheaper).\nIf you had a DisplayPort output instead, you would have the option to connect multiple monitors by daisy-chaining them if compatible, or using a HUB.  You could even connect it to HDMI displays with a DisplayPort to HDMI splitter (and no, sadly you can't do the same for an HDMI output with a simple HDMI splitter, since those just duplicate the signal, so you'd see the same thing in all the displays).\nSo, in your case, you'd need the help of some external toy, like Matrox's DualHead2Go, though these didn't made it to the HDMI age, and only work with VGA and DVI.\n", "Q: What image slideshow applications have many transition effects?

How can I write a script to automatically copy newly added files to another folder?\n\nA: cron and rsync would be my tools of choice. I'm going to assume you've mounted this network share through naultilus or another method. There are other, better ways to mount things than through Naultilus (especially for scripting purposes) but I'll leave that up to you:\nOpen a terminal and run crontab -e. You might be asked to select an editor (nano is easiest). In there you want to add a new line that looks something like this:\n*/5 * * * * rsync -avz ~/.gvfs/remote/path/ ~/scans/\n\nControl-x, then y to save.\nThat will sync everything down from  ~/.gvfs/remote/path/ to ~/scans/ every five minutes. It won't re-download things that haven't changed. Of course you'll want to edit the paths and you might want to change the timing for the cron statement. You might want to limit it to in-hours, or run it more often.\n\nA: *\n\n*Let $share contain the path to your \"share (...)to which our plotter scanner sends its scanned files\"\n\n*Let $afolder contain the path to your \"another folder\"\n\n\nMy simplisctic approach would be to keep a list of files in $share. Write a script that checks if the files currently in $share are in this list. It not, they must be new and should be moved.\nThen add this script to cron thus running it regularly.\nLet $filelist contain the path to said filelist.\nScript (not tested - just a template):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n...variables as discussed....\nfilelist=/some/path/to/the/aforementioned/filelist\n\nfind \"$share\" -type f >> /tmp/foundfiles\nwhile read fnd; do  #walk files in folder\n    isinlist=\"\"\n    while read listitem; do  #walk listitems\n        if [ \"$fnd\" -ef \"$listitem\" ]; then\n            echo \"$fnd Allready in list.\"\n            isinlist=\"inlist\"\n        fi\n    done < \"$filelist\"\n    if [ ! -n \"$isinlist ]; then\n        echo \"$fnd\" >> \"$filelist\"\n        cp \"$fnd\" to \"$afolder\"\n    fi\ndone < /tmp/foundfiles\nrm /tmp/foundfiles\nexit 0\n\nThere are tools that do that for you, like rsync.

Now Groovy 1.8. has been released.\nWhen I try to install using the same command I used to install the previous Groovy version:\nsudo apt-get install groovy\n\nI get this:\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 135 not upgraded.\n\nSo how can I install it?\n\nA: For any particular version of Ubuntu, the standard repositories are rarely updated with newer versions software.  Software is only updated for critical support issues and for security reasons.\nExceptions are made for critical pieces of software such as Firefox that Canonical say they support.  In these cases, a decision is made whether the software is about to lose support upstream.  If it is, then a newer version in the repository is updated.\nAs far as I can see \"groovy\" isnt a Canonical supported piece of software and hence will not be updated to a newer version.\nTo obtain newer versions of software, you will need to either download the source-code yourself and compile and install it - or find a trusted PPA where the packager has done the compilation for you.\nV1.8 of Groovy was released at the end of last month.  Even the next version of Ubuntu (11.10) does not have this version in its repositories.\n\nA: You may need to use sdkman, which makes it easier to get the latest groovy up and running, as shown here on the \"Install Groovy\" page\nSimply open a new terminal and enter:\n$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash\n\nFollow the instructions on-screen to complete installation.\nOpen a new terminal or type the command:\n$ source \"$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh\"\n\nThen install the latest stable Groovy:\n$ sdk install groovy\n\nAfter installation is complete and you’ve made it your default version, test it with:\n$ groovy -version\n\nThat’s all there is to it!\nI had the same issue in Cloud9 IDE.\n\nA: SDKMAN is the easiest way to install groovy:\n$ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash\n$ source \"$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh\"\n$ sdk install groovy\n\nthat's all.\n\nA: Sorry for the late response, just saw this post now. You can find an alternative repository for groovy that will allow you to install the latest groovy versions at Fresh Groovy\nFor the latest 1.8 version, here are the instructions from the site:\n# first time users\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:groovy-dev/groovy\n\n# all users\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install groovy-1.8\n\n", "Q: Where can I find the fingerprint of 'bazaar.launchpad.net'?

Is it possible to add the Nvidia X Settings to the Panel so it can be worked from there? For example to have the ability to change resolutions, change AA, AF, Vsync, Detect other monitors, change refresh rate, etc..\n\nA: Disper maybe too limited for what you are asking but I think using nvidia-settings from the command line might achieve this. Use nvidia-settings --help or man for settings available.\nThe other program you may need is nv-control-dpy but that's not ideal as you need to build it from the source code before you can use it. It is very powerful though and I will be using it when creating a script for docking my laptop with external monitors.\nTo add all these commands to the gnome panel would be only possible with custom desktop entries (shortcuts) to the settings you want to switch.\n\nA: Try Disper.

I have a dual monitor set-up. When I'm on YouTube, and I click the fullscreen icon, the fullscreen automatically goes to the second monitor. How do I get it to go fullscreen on my main monitor? \n\nA: The only successful workaround that I have found so far is an extension for Chrome:\nMultiple Monitor Full Screen\nIt maximises the Youtube video to the Chrome window which you can then Fullscreen on which ever monitor you like.\nYou should be aware of a small exiting from full-screen bug that affects Chrome on Ubuntu. Flash swallows the F11 key command so use Ctrl-Tab to switch to a non-flash tab and use F11 from there.\n\nA: I think the best solution is using the MaximizeFlash plugin for Chrome. It detects any flash in the page and you can make them fullscreen. To get rid of toolbar up just hit f11. You dont need to install any other apps. \n\nA: There is some code here\nali1234/fullscreenhack\nWhich creates a small wrapper library that can be pre-loaded before launching firefox or chrome and it fixes the information about the screen sizes that flash uses, so you get full screen flash on either monitor at the correct full size. It is quite simple to set up\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev\ngit clone git://github.com/ali1234/fullscreenhack.git\ncd fullscreenhack\nmake\nenv LD_PRELOAD=./libfullscreenhack.so firefox\n\nthen try a video full screen.\n\nA: This works:\nFullscreen Flash Video With Dual Monitors Workarounds | Ubuntu Root\n\nA: There is a very similar issue which does not answer exactly your question, but still might be helpful for your usecase. When watching fullscren HTML5 videos (e.g. youtube), the video closes by default if you click anywhere.

I have a nano which I barely ever download anything to and haven't done so recently.  I use it mainly for music.  I also have the 4G iPod shuffle and that is the thing I have trouble with. \nI have tried to download music to it through Banshee and that works fine.  However podcasts won't download through Banshee. When I download through Rhythmbox I can download the podcast, but it destroys the voice over kit. I have tried GTKPod and that works for nothing and always ruins the iPod voice over kit.   So my question is what Media Player that will download Podcast is the most compatible with the iPod shuffle 4G? I am currently downloading and trying UMP.\n\nA: You might want to try Floola. I haven't tried it on a shuffle, but I've had good success with a few different iPod models with it: \nhttp://www.floola.com/home/\n\nA: Try Banshee once more and update it if not latest, which can sync ipods of many types . I've tried it myself with a mini\nTry Pearlpod as an alternative\n\nA: I've had good luck with gPodder, albeit on my classic.\nhttp://gpodder.org/\nIt just downloads and syncs podcasts to a device. I've it used in conjunction with gtkpod handling my music and I've never had it screw up the music end of things.\nI don't know how it will interact with the voice-over kit though, but I haven't seen any bug reports on the site for the 4G shuffle.\n\nA: As another shuffle user I only recommend Banshee. But banshee from PPA.\nyou have the PPA here: https://launchpad.net/~banshee-team/+archive/ppa\nOr here http://banshee.fm/download/\nTo add just: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:banshee-team/ppa\nThen just update the repositories and download/upgrade Banshee.\nRight now am uploading more music to it. There is NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER.\nIf you want the Voice for the song titles you need to use Virtualbox with a guest Windows and install Itunes. You also need the extension for Virtualbox to enable usb support. Its as easy as connecting the shuffle, telling the usb device in virtualbox to load the Ipod and use itunes inside virtualbox to install the voice for the songs.\nSame for podcast.

I've created a series of small PNG files using Blender and I was wondering if there was a tool (preferably in the repos.) that would convert them to an animated GIF.\nOne extra stipulation: the tool needs to also be able to set the background color of the GIF to a specified color since the PNG files have an alpha channel and I don't want the GIF to be transparent.\n\nA: Yes, using imagemagicks convert tool:\nconvert   -delay 20   -loop 0   frame*.png   animated.gif\n\nThis will take all of the source frames and will make them into one animated GIF image.  The -delay 20 argument will cause a 20 hundredths of a second delay between each frame, and the -loop 0 will cause the gif to loop over and over again.\nAs for setting the background color for the gif, that can be done with the background and flatten flags:\nconvert -delay 20 -loop 0 frame*.png -background white -flatten animated.gif\n\n\nA: According to this StackOverflow Question you can use ImageMagick or a Python script. \n", "Q: How do I get turbo boost working?

Just open it as root, look for ondemand voice and disable it (space key for select/deselect)!\n\nA: Like sad David Gardner best solution it's turbostat which in additional Linux-tools it show real frequency. It works with cpu on Ivy Bridge where cat /proc/cpuinfo can't show real info. I can also recommend to use this script \ncd && wget -O .laptop-mode.sh http://goo.gl/AH0tvj\nchmod +x .laptop-mode.sh && ./.laptop-mode.sh\n\nIt help tune cpu and force turbo boost to work constantly.

I have often wondered, when an update is made to ext4 for example in the kernel and then more performance updates are made to it (And they keep up adding up over time) when i upgrade to the latest Ubuntu version, do they get applied to an already internal hard drive that is using ext4 already since 10.04.\nI have 2 hard drives with ext4 which i formatted a year ago. Do this performance or fixes in the kernel need a reformat to the hard drives or do the ext4 partitions need nothing more than just to connect to the new kernel.\nWhat is the actual difference between formatting in an old Ubuntu version using an old ext4 version versus formatting a new hard drive with a new shiny Ubuntu.\nAm using ext4 as an example but any other partition format applies that has received updates with the release of newer kernel versions.\n\nA: Normally these changes happen \"transparently\". Your filesystem on-disk remains mostly the same (unless there have been changes to the on-disk structure, which is rare), but the real change is what happens in the kernel (software level).\nIn essence, you don't need to reformat or anything, the changes will be carried onward. The only instance I can think of that requires physical change is when their is a new feature added, such as lets saw for example, Copy On Write support for a file system that doesn't have it normally. In such a case, the only change usually needed is to add a mount option to the FSTAB file.\n", "Q: Is it possible to unformat an ext4 partition that previously had an ext4 partition on it? I was having a moment of distraction and accidentally checked the format option and started formatting an encrypted ext4 home partition with ext4 - losing access to files.

(is it possible to work with this and mount this without turning it into an iso?)\nHow do I if I can, get it back? \"no errors\" were reported scanning the partition afterwards with harddrive tool.\ntestdisk maybe?\n\nA: No, it is not possible.  Your best bet is to restore from backup.  If you don't have a backup, then kick yourself for not keeping backups, pray to whatever god you believe in, and give photorec from the testdisk package a try.  You will need another drive to save any recovered files to, and you will have a fun time trying to identify and name them.\n", "Q: Dell Vostro 1510 trackpad A week ago I moved totally from Windows 7 to Ubuntu.

Speifically, the Back, Forward, and Close Tab buttons (perhaps others). This is in Gnome 2.

I'm guessing this is what you're seeing.\nYou can fix it simply by running a 64-bit version of Firefox.

I once got started on a PyGtk and Glade tutorial but never finished it. Recently I saw that PyGtk is being depreciated in favor of using introspection at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/appdevweek1104/GObjectIntrospection and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/appdevweek1104/PyGI. I decided to try learning more of python and Gtk again using the new way. The pages I linked to seem to show how you would do it if I wanted to make the GUI in the code, but I like to use Glade. Is there a way to do this and still use the new introspection?\n\nA: Yes, in fact it's almost exactly the same:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass Test (object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.builder = Gtk.Builder()\n        self.builder.add_from_file(\"test.glade\")\n        self.builder.connect_signals(self)\n\n    def run(self, *args):\n        self.builder.get_object(\"window1\").show()\n        Gtk.main()\n\n    def quit(self, *args):\n        Gtk.main_quit()\n\n\nTest().run()\n\nMany smaller programs will take little effort to convert. You can start by switching to gobject introspection using the following two lines, and then correct any errors by looking them up in the reference. \nfrom gi.repository import Gtk as gtk\nfrom gi.repository import Gobject as gobject\n\nFor example, gtk.RESPONSE_OK will be called Gtk.ResponseType.OK when you're using introspection.\n\nA: Keep in mind that you need Glade 3.10 or newer to build a GTK 3 interface. 3.8 or older is for GTK 2. In Ubuntu, the packages are called glade and glade-gtk2.\nIf you need to convert an (old) PyGTK app to PyGI, you should try the pygi-convert script that comes with the PyGObject tarball. In a lot of cases, this should be enough to transform your application.\nIt is also found in GIT: http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/tree/pygi-convert.sh\nThe following link should help too with some basic explanation of the common things that have changed: https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject/IntrospectionPorting\nAnd finally, here is an (very nice) effort to create a PyGI tutorial: http://readthedocs.org/docs/python-gtk-3-tutorial/en/latest/index.html\nI find it usefull to have a look at the C docs when building something: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/\nOnce you know how everything is done in Python, this can be a very good resource for things that aren't documented yet. Let's have a look at the gtk.RESPONSE_OK example given in the other answer.

I used to run Ubuntu 10.10 on my desktop computer, and I had all sorts of settings configured as I liked.\nI had to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.04, so I lost those settings, but it doesn't seem to matter, because, from what I understand, Emerald support is now either non-existant or shaky, the new version of Compiz is incompatible with previous settings, and Ubuntu is putting its efforts into Unity, not Gnome.\nAnyway, the point is, I would like to get back to something like what I had before: Compiz, Emerald, and Gnome.\nI'm running Ubuntu \"Classic\", so I have Gnome. I've got Compiz running, though it seems to crash after every adjustment to the settings.\nBut I don't have window frames. If I select Metacity as the window manager, most Compiz effects don't work. If I select Emerald, I simply get nothing. In my Emerald themes settings, there are no more themes anymore, and I can't find them in Synaptic.\nSo... what's the deal with Emerald? Is there something to replace it?\nIs this a problem that can be solved without having to build anything from source?\n\nA: To use emerald on 11.04:\nRemove Emerald:\n$ sudo apt-get purge emerald\nDeps:\n$ sudo apt-get install libwnck-dev libwnck1.0-cil-dev git automake libtool intltool libdecoration0 libdecoration0-dev\nCompile:\ngit clone git://anongit.compiz.org/fusion/decorators/emerald\ncd emerald\ngit checkout -b compiz++ origin/compiz++\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake && sudo make install\n\nNow, open CompizConfig and enable \"Window Decoration\", \"Resize Window\" and \"Move Window\".\nMake sure \"Window Decoration\"'s command is emerald --replace .\nPress alt+f2 to run this command:\nemerald --replace\n\nYou should now have your emerald theme activated and have the ability to move the windows around.  :D\n11.10 Edits\nYou may have to modify the directions above slightly:\nCompile:\ngit clone git://anongit.compiz.org/fusion/decorators/emerald\ncd emerald\ngit checkout -b compiz++ origin/compiz++\ngit reset --hard 0936b42efbc4247d1af16d5043f9a7a36ed8063a\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake && sudo make install\n\nNote:  The git reset command goes to a specific release of their code.

I have read the documentation and did not find it very useful.\nI have the following device:\noshirowanen@laptop:~$ lsusb\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 19d2:0031 ONDA Communication S.p.A. ZTE MF636\n\nI am using Ubuntu 10.04.2.\nBasically, I don't want the device to be recognised as a usb storage device.  I am having to manually eject the device before it automatically gets recognised as a usb broadband modem.\n\nA: I have same problems with my modem on 12.04. All you have to do are the following things:\nFirst install USB_modeswitch on your computer. Try to download it from Software Center or Synaptic package manager. Also check for libusb in synaptic.\nNow check whether you have /etc/mod_switch.conf or /etc/mod_switch.d file. Don't worry about their content, just check whether they are on your system or not. If /etc/mod_switch.conf is not present then you can create it manually.\nNow check the file in /usr/share/usb_modswitch you will find a tar file in it which contain some information about your device. Look for your device file in the tar file, you will get it there.\nTo know which file you need, just run the command lsusb in your terminal to get the vendor id and product id respectively. In your file you will get the information like:\nTargetVendor=  0x12d1\nTargetProductList=\"140b,1506,150f\"\n\nMessageContent=\"55534243123456780000000000000011062000000100000000000000000000\"\n\nYou will have you own TargetVendor, Targetid, TargetMessage content.\nNow go to terminal and run gedit /etc/mod_switch.conf and write the following lines in it:\nDefaultVendor=  0x19d2\nDefaultProduct= 0x2000\n\nTargetVendor=   0x19d2\nTargetProduct=  0x0031\n\nMessageContent=\"5553424312345678000000000000061e000000000000000000000000000000\n\nPlease make sure you put the right entry. Default vendor and product can be obtained from lsusb command. Target vendor, product and message content from the file I mentioned above. Save it and close the file.\nNow open the terminal and run the following command:\nsudo usb_modeswitch -c /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf \n\n\nA: I am not sure that I completely understand your problem because according to usb_modeswitch your device is in the modem mode i.e the device ID 0x0031 is for modem. \nThis is from the device_reference.txt file available on usb_modeswitch site:\n########################################################\n# ZTE MF622 (aka \"Onda MDC502HS\")\n# ZTE MF626\n# ZTE MF628+ (tested version from Telia / Sweden)\n# ZTE MF633\n# ZTE MF636 (aka \"Telstra / BigPond 7.2 Mobile Card\")\n# ZTE MF637\n#\n# Contributor: Joakim Wennergren and others\n\nDefaultVendor=  0x19d2\nDefaultProduct= 0x2000\n\nTargetVendor=   0x19d2\nTargetProduct=  0x0031\n\nMessageContent=\"5553424312345678000000000000061e000000000000000000000000000000\"\nMessageContent2=\"5553424312345679000000000000061b000000020000000000000000000000\"\n\nNeedResponse=1\n\nAs you can see the target ID for your device is 0x0031 which means that your device is in modem mode.\nSo if you are having this problem at system startup then try plugging your device in after the system boots into Ubuntu and not before.\nBut if you are having problem when reconnecting the device for example if it got disconnected because of a network problem, then you will need to unplug and replug the device.\nUPDATE\nI just installed usb_modeswitch and found out that all entries in the config file are commented. So open /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf and look for a line containing \n;TargetProduct=  0x0031\n\nRemove semi-colon (;) from start of the following lines\n;DefaultVendor=  0x19d2\n;DefaultProduct= 0x2000\n\n;TargetVendor=   0x19d2\n;TargetProduct=  0x0031\n\n# only for reference\n# MessageEndpoint=0x01\n\n;MessageContent=\"55534243123456782000000080000c85010101180101010101000000000000\"\n\nNow save and close this file. You will need sudo privileges for this. Now unplug and replug your device and I believe it should work. If it doesnt then comment the MessageContent line and un-comment (remove semi-colon) the second MessageContent line which is just below the first one. \n", "Q: How do I find out where in /dev my microphone audio input is going? My microphone works properly (using the sound control panel, it shows bars when I talk, and it works with Google talk, etc). Now I want to use it for xvidcap, and it needs a file to read the audio input from. I tried /dev/dsp and /dev/snd as guesses, but they don't work. How do I tell for certain where my audio input is going?\n\nA: Look into /dev/snd/ in order to find the individual devices. /dev/snd/ is a directory, not a file.\nWhich version of xvidcap do you use? Mine, 1.1.7, has no option to set the sound input other than the system default. Ideally, xvidcap should use PulseAudio for audio input, failing that it should use Alsa.

At this point it works again.\nI'm using ubuntu 11.04 with Unity with an ATI radeon HD4500 with propriertary drivers.\n\nA: Solved.\nThe problem was caused by compiz plugin.

There are some one-time jobs such as Beats-Per-Minute-detection and analyzing music similarity that can be very CPU-intensive.  In Edit > Preferences > Extensions, you can make sure that some of these features are turned off.  See this answer for more information about how to improve Banshee's CPU usage.\n\n*It could be a problem with Banshee's database.  You can optimize the database by installing the sqlite3 program and running sqlite3 ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db \"vacuum; analyze;\" in terminal.  Other helpful advice about database performance can be found on the Performance Issues page of the Banshee Wiki.\n\n*If nothing helps, you should definitely file a bug report.  Be sure to attach the output of banshee --debug and banshee --debug-sql to your bug report (more information about getting debug logs).\n\nA: Try my suggested* method for taming banshee. It worked for me to bring banshee down from around 50%->75%, to around 10%->20%, and it might work for you.\nEdit:\nUnder advice, I've decided to post the details here :) (defeats my laziness).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Banshee preferences, and find all the addins you are not really using, and probably won’t for a while:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Disable even the slightest – including last.fm suggestions etc.\nHere is what my list looks like now:\n\n\n\n\n**The link is to my blog, to avoid typing it all over again.*\n", "Q: Whenever I plugged my monitor to my laptop the display the background image stays in the same resolution My HP Mini is having a problem when plugged into a monitor with high resolution. the problem is the background image stays the same resolution of my laptop which is 1024 x 576 thus leaving blank black portion on the monitor.\n\nA: Have you tried going to the menu-system-monitors and then changing the aspect ratio(screen size) from there? It should work and has worked for me in the past.\n", "Q: Why is the default delay for the static application switcher pop up set to 0.2s? At first I thought it was just lag. It's a horrible default setting in my opinion, since when I hold alt+tab, I don't expect to have to wait. As default, it seems to make my experience less smooth.\n\nA: When quickly switching between two applications, you don't necessarily want to see a popup. That is what the 0.2s is for.  You can decrease the actual window switch delay by changing the speed from 4 to ~1. This is probably the setting you are looking for - I don't see any reason for delaying the pop-up. \n", "Q: How can I export MySQL database manually - without phpmyadmin My phpmyadmin doesn't work.

I believe this is because Zeitgeist does not index folders, and locate (which Synapse uses, I believe)  does not touch my NTFS drive.\nSo in short, is there any way to index my NTFS partition ? In such a way that it is accessible via locate. Or perhaps make Zeitgeist index folders as well?\nAs of now, Dash gives results from NTFS partition, but there are no folders in the result. On the other hand, locate gives me folders, but only on the native ubuntu partition.\n\nA: Zeitgeist logs events by two ways\n\n\n*\n\n*Zeitgeist Datahub\n\n*Selective Datasources\n\n\nDatahub\nThe first one is installed by default in Ubuntu (Natty and later) along with Zeitgeist. Datahub is a passive logger which is GtkRecentManager on steroids. Any new entry to ~/.recently-used.xbel is taken up by Datahub and added to Zeitgeist\nSelective Datasources\nDatasources are extensions/plugins/addins/addons for applications which help in logging events. Example Tomboy notes are not logged by datahub as they are not logged by GtkRecentManager. \nIn this case a Tomboy datasources (implemented as a plugin) can be enabled which logs events like Note Open,Closed, Created and Deleted\nIf you are on Natty, then you install Datasources for these applications\n\n\n*\n\n*Bzr \n\n*Emacs\n\n*Eye of Gnome\n\n*Geany\n\n*gedit\n\n*Rhythmbox \n\n*Tomboy\n\n*Totem\n\n*Vim\n\n*XChat\n\n\nYou can install the datasources by\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:zeitgeist/ppa\nand look for packages zeitgeist-datasource-* (e.g. zeitgeist-datasource-rhythmbox)\nOTOH you can install Banshee's datasource by installing the package banshee-extensions-zeitgeistdataprovider\nIf you open files, start/stop tracks, open/close/create/delete notes or any relevant activity from these applications then they will be logged. Even the music tracks are logged(their URI on the disk).\nThere are be two problems\n\n\n*\n\n*GtkRecentManager fails to work on NTFS partition\n\n*Everytime you mount your NTFS partition, it is assigned a different mount point. (You can pin it in /etc/fstab)\n\n\nI can guess the problem can be in latter. Can you try installing banshee datasource, enable the datasource, listen to a few tracks(on NTFS partition) and then try to find them via Synapse or Dash (I personally prefer Synapse)\n\nA: Dash is using the index database created by locate.\nTo make locate to index and show file on an NTFS partition, you should edit the file /etc/updatedb.conf, and change the line\nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool /media\"\n\nto \nPRUNEPATHS=\"/tmp /var/spool\"\n\nThis works if your NTFS partition is mounted on a mountpoint under /media (highly probable). \nTo update immediately the locate database, run\nsudo updatedb\n\n\nA: Haver you tried Recoll?  Is pretty good but so far still having troubles adding the NTFS partitions, everyone tells me that in settings you can do that, but there is no option to add something beside /home\n", "Q: Since upgrade to Natty, no longer automatically booting from drive at startup As the subject suggests, I now have to enter the boot menu in BIOS in order to be able to boot Ubuntu. This has happened since I upgraded to Natty. Is there a way to automatically boot from the correct drive without this manual intervention? Thanks for any help\n\nA: Check your bios settings. Make sure they are set to the drive where you have ubuntu installed by default. Unfortunately the bios screens vary from computer to computer so it's hard to give detailed instructions.\n", "Q: ElasticFox on Firefox 4 How are you supposed to install the ElasticFox add-on on Firefox (4.0.1) on latest Ubuntu (11.04)? (ElasticFox is an extension for Amazon EC2 management.)\nGoing to Tools -> Add-ons and searching for it returns nothing. Top results for \"install elasticfox firefox 4\" search are strange links that just throw me back to browser's home page. Apparently people who had it installed before upgrading to Firefox 4 have got it working, but how about us who don't have it yet? \n\nA: Thanks to our awesome George Edison I was able to modify that plugin to make it work with Firefox 4.0.1. Thanks again for pointing that out!\nHere is the modified plugin.\n", "Q: Hamster applet in UNR 9.10 How do I add the hamster applet in Ubuntu netbook remix? \nIf I start /usr/lib/hamster-applet/hamster-applet -w it works in a window fine.\nIt is written, I should go on the panel and add, but I guess this is not possible in UNR?\n\nA: It should be possible with 9.10 (but not with 10.04), but it's a bit tricky to get to the Add to panel-option. Let me cite Paul Larson from this bug report:\n\nThis is actually possible to do,\n  although perhaps not as\n  straightforward as many people would\n  like it to be. I was able to just do\n  this on a UNR install by following\n  these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*right click on the indicator applet (the icon that looks like an envelope)\n  \n*deselect \"Lock to panel\"\n  \n*right-click on it again and select 'Move'\n  \n*move it over a bit to the left, thus leaving an open blank area to the\n  right of it\n  \n*right click in the blank area and select 'add to panel'\n  \n  \n  I'd like to make this a wishlist item\n  for now, but it could perhaps be\n  converted to a question as well if it\n  is decided not to pursue this as\n  something that could be improved\n\n", "Q: How to open .arc file I have a Contacts.arc file which took from a nokia phone as a back-up of contacts.Now my mobile is lost and i want to see some numbers.Is there any application to open .arc file in ubuntu?. I searched in google but didn't get any answer.\n\nA: You may be able to use NbuExplorer (an open-source Windows application) to view the contents of the file.\nI was able to run it in Ubuntu by installing the Mono Visual Basic Compiler (VB.NET)  (sudo apt-get install mono-vbnc) and then running mono NbuExplorer.exe.

(An alternate\n   extension sometimes used was ‘.ark’; these work too.)

I didn't know this. I can understand nesting them can be difficult, and I use ${} is scripts, but I would like to be able to evaluate commands interactively in the shell.\n\nA: This is a feature not a bug.\nThink about the scenario this way: In order to make that completion the shell would have to RUN the command in the backticks. This could cause very serious negative consequences if it was something that wasn't meant to run more than once, that took lots of time to execute, etc.\nIn order to do expansion, bash needs just a string that is a path, not some program to have to execute in order to get a string to complete. Consider the suggestion to use ./ as path for the present working directory as well advised!\nBackticks are not old or deprecated, although the newer $() syntax is generally preferred these days. However in your example, using a command at all is ill-advised. Backticks and command should be used sparingly and only when another syntax isn't possible.\n\nA: Try\ncd ./TAB\ninstead. \ncd $VAR/...\ncd $(cmd)/...\n\ndon't work for me, either. Maybe you can compare the /etc/bash_completion files.\n\nA: There are situations where \"$PWD/\" is needed instead of \"./\", so it should not be suggested to always to use \"./\" instead of \"$PWD/\".\nOne example is when you do a symbolic link.\nSuppose you're in /somefolder. Now you run the following command:\nln -s ./file /target/file\n\nThis becomes a broken link. What you really need to do is:\nln -s $PWD/file /target/file\n\nIt is very inefficient to type the whole path. This problem is independent from \"deprecation\" issues as symlink just doesn't work in this way.\nThus, I suggest you to file a bug to fix this problem.\n", "Q: how to put a trigger on a directory I have a script that scans a directory and does some maintenance on the files in it. Another process creates the files in the directory (10 - 30 files per day). \nThe script is called via a daily cron job . What I need is to trigger the script on an event (each time a new file is created in the directory). I prefer this rather than increasing the frequency of the cron job.\nHow can I do that? is there a command or a program to install?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: Another utility worth to know is fileschanged (man page here), that can monitor filesystem event on selected files or directories, for example the following command\nfileschanged -s created -t1 $PWD\n\nshould monitor the current directory for file creation events, writing the name of the created file on stdout with a 1sec timeout.\nfileschanged can watch folders recursively (as can iwatch as noted in another answer), unlike incron and inoticoming.\n\nA: There is also a small program called iwatch - see the man page (this page is for Ubuntu precise (12.04), it has links to other ubuntu versions).\niwatch has the ability watch folders recursively (ie: subfolders too) and to send emails in response to file/directory events.\n\nA: inoticoming\n\ninoticoming is a daemon to watch a directory with Linux's inotify framework and trigger actions once files with specific names are placed in there.\nFor example it can be used to wait for .changes files uploaded into a directory and call reprepro to put them into your repository. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Manual page of inoticoming\nincron\n\nincron is an \"inotify cron\" system. It works like the regular cron but is driven by filesystem events instead of time events. This package provides two programs, a daemon called \"incrond\" (analogous to crond) and a table manipulator \"incrontab\" (like \"crontab\").\nincron uses the Linux Kernel inotify syscalls.\nlike cron, each user can edit its own incron tables. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Manual page of incrond\n\n*Manual page of incrontab\n\n*Manual page of icron.conf\n\nA: inotify man page is located there\nif you prefer python scripts, you can use pyinotify\n\nA: As of 2023, I'd recommend looking at fswatch or guard, which both work on many platforms.\n", "Q: Mouse busy cursor is lost After a clean install of 11.04, I don't see the busy indicator of mouse cursor anymore, except first startup. I have to check the harddisk busy light every time (for which I have to look under table, which is annoying). Other cursors are fine.\nAny idea how can I fix this weird situation?\n\nA: Maybe nothing on your system has triggered the \"busy\" cursor. Some changes that landed in 11.04 (such as the way the kernel handles processes) might make it far less likely for you to see the busy cursor. Personally I only see it on rare occasions.\n\nA: I think it's a bug in Unity 3D. The solution is to add StartupNotify=true under the [Desktop Entry] in your .desktop file.\n", "Q: How do I unmaximize full screen view in virt-manager? After activating full screen view for a virtual machine in virt-manager there is no obvious way to un-full screen. Any ideas?\n\nA: Neither of the existing answers worked for me when running a VM in fullscreen using 12.04.\nIf you look at the top center of the screen, you can see a little sliver of white. Hover the mouse over that sliver and it will reveal two icons: an \"unfullscreen\" on the left, and a \"send key combo\" on the right. You may have to ungrab by pressing Ctrl-Alt momentarily before it will come up. Click the \"unfullscreen\" to get back to a windowed view.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F  Is the toggle switch for the top center menu bar.\nIf you see no menu bar in the top center after a slight over\nToggle it on with\nCtrl+Alt+F \nAnd try again\n\nA: Had the same problem with osx today. I found out that if you hover the mouse in the top middle of the screen where the white bar is supposed to be, even though it doesn't show up long enough to actually click on it, you can use ctrl+alt+arrow keys to move to other workspaces while the mouse is there.\n\nA: When in full screen mode, hit Ctrl+Alt to 'unhinge' the mouse and move the mouse to the top-middle of the screen. A little applet drops down to allow you to leave full screen and send key-combinations.\n\nA: I just put the mouse in the top centre to of the screen and a toolbar with exit fullscreen appears.\n Running fedora 23 with gnome\nHope tis helps.\n\nA: Alt+F10 or Alt+drag down with your mouse.\n\nA: It don't seems there is any keywords set for this action and on Kubuntu 12.04 (KDE 4.9.5), none of given keyboard shortcuts worked for me.\nTrick to make the Thin-bar pop-out\nIf you struggle to make the tiny toolbar pop-out, here is a how to do it : \n\n\n*\n\n*focus another windows (click it) ;\n\n*then hover the thin-toolbar ;\n\n*click when it pop-out\n\n\nIf virt-manager has the focus, I can't get the toolbar to show up.\nRoadmap\nThe full-screen issue should be addressed in the coming release as state on the project roadmap :\n\nProper fullscreen mode -- Currently the VNC fullscreen mode leaves a\n  menu bar at the top of the screen which sucks for numerous reasons.

From here I can close things and reopen things as needed. I don't run Compiz.\n\nA: If compiz settings include the grid plugin settings, then the white bar doesn't slide down.  So what I had to do was use one of the \"grid plugin\" hotkeys like \"<Alt><NumKP3>\" to get a smaller window.  Then, hovering over the bar allowed me to use the bar to click the button to exit fullscreen.\n\nA: Shift + F11 work for me\nI use spicec\n", "Q: How to perform a rake task after startup?

Browsing is just fine but what \"business purposes\" are you talking about? Do you need to run certain software? Windows software is largely incompatible with other operating systems (although there are workarounds).\nI would definitely suggest you download Ubuntu and try it for a few hours. It's free to download. Burn it to a CD/USB or install it under Windows and restart the machine (there is help on the download page). If it works well for you, you can look at doing a proper install and migrating your data over.\n\nA: Well since you are on a forum for Ubuntu Linux this will likely be your first answer. Ubuntu is a great distribution for people who are new to Linux, with very clear instructions on how to set your laptop up with Windows + Ubuntu or only Ubuntu. Simply go to the download page and follow the instructions from there to get started!\nMost beginner Linux distributions come with a large feature set such as web browser, office suite, and media players that you won't see included by default with Windows. Each distro also features an intuitive User Interface that should allow you to become comfortable with transitioning from windows fairly quickly. You are likely to find it even more intuitive than the Windows layout!\nIf Ubuntu is not to your liking you can try several Ubuntu-based distributions that use Ubuntu as a starting point, but will often have different default applications or user interfaces. \nLinux Mint - is a popular Ubuntu based distro that combines a different user interface with the default inclusion of many popular plugins and codec's such as Flash and mp3 support. \nPinguy OS - is a version of Ubuntu that includes tons of default applications to fit every users needs, and focuses on providing a enjoyable out-of-the-box experience for all users.\nElementary OS - is a distribution based off of Ubuntu that emphasises a clean user interface with elimination of clutter and good-looking, simple applications. This distro is new in the game, but certainly one to watch.\nAnd remember that you are more than welcome to try all or any of these distributions without affecting your laptop! Simply download the .iso, burn it to a CD, and restart your computer with it in the drive. When prompted, select \"Try operating system\" to give the distribution a test run before installing! If you decide you like it, you can run the installer from within the test run.\n", "Q: Problem with my partitions? I needed to split my hard disk into 5 partitions for installing Ubuntu 11.04. The first one (*) was for system reserved - 100mb, second (C) was the installation of Windows 7, third (D) was for my work files, fourth (E) was for my multimedia (pictures, music etc.) and the last one was for Ubuntu 11.04. After doing so, some warning appeared telling me something about \"can't boot...\" I don't remember (stupid of me), and after doing so, all partitions got simple volume and not primary partition, even where my operating system is. Now when I boot with Ubuntu CD, to install, when I want to format the partition I made just for Ubuntu, there is none of the previously made partitions for Ubuntu installation and swap space, just two partitions - the first 160gb and the second - 150gb. The system is booting correctly and working correctly but it is kind of weird, is there any way to change it to primary partition? I used EASEUS Partition Master Home edition to convert them safely, but the option isn't there to use!!! So I have two questions, first:\nWhat happened with my partitions and is it worth converting them? What are the cons and pros about simple and primary partitions?\nAnd the second question:\nHow to install Ubuntu 11.04 to another partition like I done so far ( but when I boot with the Ubuntu cd I burned) to recognize the free space or the recently made partitions, not only two like before (it recognized only two partition, one was C and the second was E )? - that is the main problem :P\nI know this is long question (2 questions) but I'm really desperate to fix this two problems...\n\nA: Q1 - from [Administration][Disk Utility], Ubuntu should give you a view of what it knows about partitions, including partitions not presently mounted.\nDON'T try to change the partition which is mounted as /\nClicking around this screen, one may select and format unused partitions, create new partitions in unused space, or reformat a partition with a filesystem such as ext4 and (optionally) a mount point.  I prefer to do something else with storage partitions; not mount them at all unless I need them for something that day.\nI've observed some override during default installation of what I thought I asked Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.04 to do with partitions, also Edubuntu10.10  I am not sure why that happened.  If your machine is for long term stable use then I'd prefer Ubuntu 10.04 because of its long term support and try out new stuff such as version 11.04 as a virtual machine (if your computer has the spare GB of RAM and spare 10GB of hard drive space for doing such trials).\nWhen I installed Ubuntu 10.04 whose partition manager was not doing what I thought I had asked it to, I started again from scratch, prepared part of the disk by firing up an Ubuntu 9.10 (32bit) live CD, which I trust, and used [Administration][Disk Utility] to set up the master boot record, create partitions such as /boot, /home, / and SWAP \nand formated as ext4,ext4,ext4 and SWAP.\nRebooting the live CD, and this time selecting 'install Ubuntu', subsequent option to 'custom' choose where to install has worked properly.  At the time of writing, I have noticed 'LVM' formatting options in newver Ubuntu and Fedora versions which seem to be a distraction when setting up a standard home system.\nQ2  How to get installation of Ubuntu into your choice of partitions\nWhen it offers a choice between standard or custom(advanced) partitioning, that is where it is meant to see all partitions on the hard drive.  Expect numbering similar to sda for the first physical hard drive, sda1, sda2 .. for partitions which you might be more used to seeing labelled as C,D .. under Windows.  It is best to recognise which is what from the sizes of them.  It should give you choices at this stage to format partions.  I avoid making changes to the partitioning here but might type or select the mount points for those partitions which I want to use.    \nIf your 11.04 CD never sees your previously preparated partitions then reboot, select 'try Ubuntu without making changes to your computer', and see what you can see under [Administration][Disk Utility].  Running as a live CD in RAM, the whole hard drive is not mounted so is unlocked to formating tools, which can be convenient so long as you are not the type to accidently wipe a C: drive because it had been labelled 'hda1'.  Recognise your partitions by size, and you'll be ok.\n", "Q: Missing libxmlrpc-c3 dependency while installing Boxee anyone can help me to installing boxee in ubuntu natty 11.04, there is an error \n\"Dependency is not satisfiable: libxmlrpc-c3\"\n\n\nA: Looking at the forums, this is a known issue with the version of Boxee which you have downloaded from the vendor's website.\nThe consensus is that the vendor does update the version of boxee when a new distribution such as Natty is released, but you may have to wait a few days/weeks\nAssuming that you are unwilling to wait :-)    \nThere is a workaround to \"correct\" the dependency that can no longer be satisfied in Natty (i.e. that library in your screenshot).\nOpen you text editor and save the contents of the the following (thanks to this forum post):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nEDITOR=gedit\n\nif [[ -z \"$1\" ]]; then\n  echo \"Syntax: $0 debfile\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nDEBFILE=\"$1\"\nTMPDIR=`mktemp -d /tmp/deb.XXXXXXXXXX` || exit 1\nOUTPUT=`basename \"$DEBFILE\" .deb`.modfied.deb\n\nif [[ -e \"$OUTPUT\" ]]; then\n  echo \"$OUTPUT exists.\"\n  rm -r \"$TMPDIR\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\ndpkg-deb -x \"$DEBFILE\" \"$TMPDIR\"\ndpkg-deb --control \"$DEBFILE\" \"$TMPDIR\"/DEBIAN\n\nif [[ ! -e \"$TMPDIR\"/DEBIAN/control ]]; then\n  echo DEBIAN/control not found.\n\n  rm -r \"$TMPDIR\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nCONTROL=\"$TMPDIR\"/DEBIAN/control\n\nMOD=`stat -c \"%y\" \"$CONTROL\"`\n$EDITOR \"$CONTROL\"\n\nif [[ \"$MOD\" == `stat -c \"%y\" \"$CONTROL\"` ]]; then\n  echo Not modfied.\nelse\n  echo Building new deb...\n  dpkg -b \"$TMPDIR\" \"$OUTPUT\"\nfi\n\nrm -r \"$TMPDIR\"\n\nSave the file as \"edit-deb-control.sh\" into your Downloads directory.\nOpen a terminal and type the following\ncd Downloads\n\nsh edit-deb-control.sh boxee<tab>\n\nN.B. press the  key will autocomplete the full file name\nThis will open a text editor with the contents similar to the screen-shot below\nchange the value of libxmlrpc-3 found in the file to the value shown in the screenshot:\n\nSave the file in the text editor and close the file.\nThis will create (after a while) a new .deb file in the Downloads folder.

Note that when you enter your password you will not see the letters of your password appear on the screen while you type. This is normal and is done for security reasons.\n\n\n*Once logged in, enter the following commands by typing them in, then pressing enter:\ncd ~\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop\nsudo chmod +x driver.run\nsudo ./driver.run\n\n\n*Wait for the installer to finish then enter this command: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start. This should bring back the graphical interface.\n\n\n*I'm not entirely sure if this step is required and, to be honest, I don't know what it does but when I installed the driver I opened a terminal Applications->Accessories->Terminal and entered this command: sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals. This enabled me to enable visual effects.\n\nA: Boot in recovery mode and choose root (or netroot) - that would not start X, but drop you to root shell on tty1 instead.\n\nA: You normally want to install the driver from the repos (sudo apt-get install nvidia-current) but I'm not sure if that supports opengl 3.3.  This is how you would run the driver:\n(save all your data)\nsudo telinit S\n\npick \"root prompt\"\n./driver.sh\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: /home partition not recognized I upgraded to 11.04 with a CDROM.

Ubuntu 11.10 comes with this version of Banshee installed by default.\nThere are a couple reasons that this could happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*MusicBrainz recently changed the way that third party applications can request metadata, and this change caused problems with Banshee.\n\n*Until recently, if a MusicBrainz DiscID matches multiple albums, Banshee failed to retrieve the metadata.  The recent changes to MusicBrainz make this problem more common.\nGiven the NullReferenceException warning in your log, which looks pretty similar to a log posted in the MusicBrainz forums, it seems likely that you are running into issue #2.\n", "Q: Why is my Unity theme going haywire? I have this new problem, my unity theme falls back to some old gnome theme which makes the whole look and feel absolutely horrible.\nHere is the screenshot right after login:\n\nAnd after sometime, theme changes to this:\n\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nA: It looks to me that your system is changing your theme to one that uses the Faenza icons set. Check if you have any themes that use these icons on your system and if you don't want it, just remove it. That maybe will do the trick.\nBy the way, do you have something in ~/.themes in your Home folder?\n\nA: Inspired by the answers @Jorge mentioned in Desktop forgets theme?, from TM's answer, I adapted his idea into unity env with a simple modification:\nI replaced 'gnome-settings-' in his bash script with 'unity-settings-', you know, just to change PID.

I read this tutorial and am using jhbuild to install the 41 required packages. jhbuild apparently pulls the required packages using git and wget. I have been experiencing awful internet connectivity for the past couple of months. I have complained, but my ISP does not really bother, plus I don't get time to bother. \nThe point is whenever jhbuild comes around to pull down gtk+ 3.0(or some other package) using git, my internet connectivity goes down long enough to get a \nFrom 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=1130 Destination Host Unreachable\nFrom 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=1131 Destination Host Unreachable \n\nIt invariably comes up after a few such lines, however jhbuild refuses to continue. I either have to manually restart the phase or wait till jhbuild returns an error. In both cases jhbuild starts downloading the files from scratch for that particular package. Does git not support download resuming? \nPlus, I have installed gtk+ 3.0.9(the latest stable release), but jhbuild still starts downloading gtk+ 3.0 using git. Should I download the unstable release using git?\nThis is what I often end up with\n*** Checking out gtk3 *** [8/41]\ngit clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+ gtk3\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/abc/gnome-shell/source/gtk3/.git/\nremote: Counting objects: 270771, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (41632/41632), done.\n^C*** Error during phase checkout of gtk3: ########## Error running git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+ gtk3 *** [8/41]\n\n  [1] Rerun phase checkout\n  [2] Ignore error and continue to configure\n  [3] Give up on module\n  [4] Start shell\n  [5] Reload configuration\n  [6] Go to phase \"wipe directory and start over\"\nchoice: 1\n\n\nA: Git does not support a way to continue an interrupted cloning. You need to start from scratch. So, what can you do if your Internet connection is in a mess?\nIf you can get someone to create a .tar.bz of the clone, you can download using wget -c and then extract on your computer. It is fine even if this is a rather old clone; you or jhbuild can perform a git pull --rebase to that your clone will get updated, which is quite fast.\n", "Q: Why is Spotify (WINE) so slow? I'm using Unity and wine1.3.\nSpotify installs fine, but every click in the window slows the whole system down incredibly for a few seconds. System Monitor shows that suddenly Xorg starts using ~50% CPU.\nI'm also using nVidia prop. drivers, but this issue probably has more to do with wine/unity\n\nA: I don't have answer for why Spotify is slow under Wine, but you should consider using the native Linux client. \nYou can find it at http://www.spotify.com/se/download/previews/\n\nA: When using Wine on Ubuntu, you should not use Compiz or Mutter. This means that if you're using Unity, you should switch to Unity 2D and if you're using Gnome Shell, then you should switch to Gnome Panel (Gnome Fallback). I can't say for sure that this is what's causing your particular issues, but it does cause many, so I would definitely try it. \n", "Q: With two simultaneous users, how much memory is consumed? Basically, it's my personal system (running 10.10) where I often switch from myself to my other myself (one login is for personal purposes, and the other one is the working login). So I come to situation that both myself are logged onto the system because I want to switch between accounts quickly. \nDoes anyone know how much memory has been consumed in such work? I haven't noticed any slowdowns, but I would like to know that. Is there any Ubuntu official document describing this?\n\nA: There can't be really be any documentation for this as the memory usage depends on the running application (both open and those in background) and on your system (for example, desktop effects increase memory usage). \nYou'll find the memory increase by opening the system manager when you have one user logged in and then when you have two users logged in. Don't open any application when you do the test, that way other programs won't affect your test result.\n\nA: The memory usage should be pretty close to if you were running a single user, so long as you are not running applications that use a lot of memory, and in either case, if you begin to run low on memory the system will swap some out as Gilles mentioned.\nIf you are curious to know your memory usage, just run the system-monitor:\n\n\nA: More than if there was a single user, but less than twice as much. It's extremely hard to be more specific, because it depends a lot on the applications.\nWhen you switch to a different user, most of the applications of the idle users aren't going to be doing anything. If the system needs more memory for the active applications, the idle applications will be swapped out. That's likely to mean the applications of the idle users, but Linux is pretty good at deciding what to swap out, and the fact that there are different users won't enter into consideration.\n", "Q: Using ubuntu classic window manager from USB drive I am using ubuntu 11.04 from a live USB disk.

Let's not edit the installed version in /usr/share/applications because any changes will be lost when totem is next updated.\nWe can copy the launcher to our home folder to prevent this from happening.\n\n\n*\n\n*First open a terminal and copy and paste the following:\ncp /usr/share/applications/totem.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\nnano ~/.local/share/applications/totem.desktop\n\n\n*Find the line that looks like Exec=totem %U\n\n*Change it to be Exec=totem --enqueue %U\n\n*Save, logout, login\n\n*Start totem and right click totem in the launcher and choose Keep In Launcher.\n\n\nYou can now close totem.\nHow to append to the playlist\nYou can now append to playlist in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop files from File Manager (Nautilus) onto the totem launcher. It will add the selected file/files to the playlist. I think due to a bug, don't drop files onto the totem launcher if the totem moves into the middle of the screen (I think its called spread mode). If you do, your Unity session will freeze, although Totem will continue playing.\n\n*Given the ALT-TAB issues with drag-and-drop on, perhaps an easier workaround is to right click the file/files on File Manager and choose \"Open With Movie Player\". With the --enqueue trick above, files can be repeatedly added to the play-list.\n\n", "Q: monitor or watch a process and restart if it goes down I have a worker program which I start in rc.local. The program is not the most stable in the world so I would like to set up a watcher of some kind that checks to see if the aforementioned program is chugging along and if not, start up the program again.\nI can imagine a couple of ways to do this, although I am sure there are more:\n\n\n*\n\n*have a cron job that runs and looks for the running program. If there, it stops, otherwise it fires off another instance of the program\n\n*run a dedicated monitoring program that runs all the time and polls frequently to see if the program is running. \n\n\nDo any of you have examples of either of these implementations or recommendations on how I should do this?\n\nA: I'd suggest Monit. You can install it from Synaptic or sudo apt-get install monit. I use it on my server to monitor my SSH, Apache, etc and restart them if they fail.\n\nA: You might be able use a helper script that runs the process in an infinite loop, e.g.:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Infinite loop\nwhile true; do\n\n    # Get starting time\n    start_epoch=$(date +%s)\n\n    # Run program\n    my-program\n\n    # Abort if the application exited too quickly\n    duration=$(( $(date +%s) - $start_epoch ))\n    if [[ \"$duration\" < 30 ]]; then\n        echo \"Program exited too quickly.

The sound indicator icon turns blue sometimes:\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: This is similar to this question and my answer there.  To summarise\nRed: denotes critical issues\nOrange: denotes critical warnings\nBlue: denotes pure information.\nGreen denotes that something is \"now OK\", or \"approved\".\n\nHence the sound indicator is blue to indicate just \"information\" i.e. something has happened.\nWhat this \"information\" is depends on the indicator - the ayantana team didnt specify where this \"information\" should be reported.\n\nA: The blue sound menu icon means that at least one application is trying to output sound but is unable to do so because the sound is muted.\n", "Q: MacBook crashes due to overheating?

This, and the fact that I've never heard the fan running (though it does so infrequently under OS X) leads me to believe that something inside is overheating. Any ideas?\n\nA: The fans on my Macbook 5,1 run frequently. Apple has horrible practices for cooling which I won't get into here. My Mac has the fans working automatically but I will assume that yours does not since it's tripping the built in temperature kill switch.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mactel-support\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install macfanctld\n\nIs the advised solution, however it doesn't look like there is a Natty version just yet.\nIf you have no luck with that then try\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hughescih/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mbfancontrol\n\nThis should help your computer detect the fans and use them accordingly.\n\nA: It might be worth resetting the SMC (System Management Controller) which should enable the fans etc to automatically spin up when the temperature rises without the need for something like macfanctld or mbfancontrol\n", "Q: How to change ubiquity release name I want to build a custom distribution, \nHow can I change the release name in ubiquity installer ?

I want to apply a LADSPA plugin to everything that streams through the default PulseAudio sink. How should I set this up?\n\nA: Adding a LADSPA plugin to pulseaudio is done with module-ladspa-sink.\nWe install this module as an output sink where we can define the processing module and are able to send the processed signal to this newly created sink.\nLoad the LADSPA module:\nThis module can be loaded at runtime with:\npacmd load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=<yourname> master=<sinkname> plugin=<plugin> label=<label> control=<option1>,<option2>,[...]\n\nThe name of the master sink can be read with the following command:\n pacmd list-sinks\n\nGive a name for the processed sink as it will appear in the output list in sink_name. All further options depend on the plugin we use (see example below).\nTo apply the LADSPA processor we choose the output sink from \"Sound Settings...\" and can now listen to the processed stream. Control options can not be altered at runtime.\nUnload the LADSPA module:\nWe  will have to unload the module and load it again for different options. To find the module index for unloading we may issue:\n pacmd list-modules\n\nTo unload a module we either restart the sound server with pulseaudio -k or we unload the module with it's index number #:\npacmd unload-module <#>\n\nSee also the reference wiki from pulseaudio.\nLoad LADSPA module at startup:\nAfter having found the appropriate options we may want to run it per default. This can be done by including it to the /etc/pulse/default.pa configuration file to be loaded by the daemon on startup:\n.ifexists module-ladspa-sink.so\n.nofail\nload-module module-ladspa-sink <options>\n.fail\n.endif\n\n\nExample:\nThis is an example of one special case to give you an idea on how to do it. In this example we want to apply a pitch shift to our sound output using the unfortunately no longer active TAP-plugin tap_pitch (tap-plugins ). For this plugin the additional options needed for loading to Pulse Audio are the following:\nplugin=tap_pitch # as from /usr/lib/ladspa/ without .so\nlabel=tap_pitch  # defines which label of a plugin to use\n\nTo find the appropriate control options we may still find the plugin documentation in a web archive (previous URL: TAP plugin pitch shifter). There we find a nice table of four relevant controls we have to apply in the control= command:\ncontrol=<semitone>,<rate>,<dry>,<wet>\n\nLeaving an option empty will use the default in this case.\nThus the following command will apply a pitch shift of one octave downward from my master sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo (replace with your sink) to the output sink ladspa_out with a semitone shift of -12, that is a rate shift of -50%, and with a dry (unprocessed) mixer level of -90dB, and a wet (processed) level of 0dB.\npacmd load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=ladspa_out master=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo plugin=tap_pitch label=tap_pitch control=-12,-50,-90,0\n\nFor some plugins the documentation may be not be complete, or appropriate setting will need quite some experimenting until they are right.\n", "Q: How to add packages to Ubuntu 11.04 Install DVD?

I want to add all my debs and install in other pc with my math packages. Is there any way? \n\nA: To Remaster a Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB you have to use:\nA) The Ubuntu LiveCD Wiki\nB) remastersys\n\nC) Ubuntu Customization Kit\n\nI, personally suggest you to use UCK, which is more user-friendly.\n\nA: En Ingles:\nYou could optionally add the debs to the install DVD in a separate folder, and then manually install them after installing Ubuntu.\nFor example:\nsudo dpkg -i /media/cdrom/packagefolder/*\n\nEn Español, de Google Translate:\nSi lo desea, puede añadir los debs para el DVD de instalación en una carpeta aparte, y luego instalarlos manualmente después de instalar Ubuntu.\nPor ejemplo:\nsudo dpkg -i /media/cdrom/packagefolder/*\nLo siento por errores, si los hay.\n", "Q: Best practices to ease the OS upgrade procedure I'm going to install a fresh Ubuntu (LTS). My question is about the upgrade to the new LTS version, and in particular I'd like to know which best practices I have to adopt to reduce potential upgrade issues when the new version is released.\nFor example, don't install packages from unofficial repositories, etc.\nI'll appreciate any thoughts on this. Thanks.\n\nA: The best advice I can think of is take measures so that, in case of any problem, you can go back to your old configuration while you work on fixing the problem.\nIn particular:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data\n\n*Keep your data in a different partition than the OS\n\n*Reserve a spare partition for the future distribution\n\n\nThe last bullet I think isn't very common, but I find it quite effective. What I do when I have to upgrade is avoid the upgrade procedure completely and just install the new distribution in a different partition while using the same partition for my home directory. This way, if the new distribution doesn't work for me, I can either look into the problem and try to fix it or, if I need to do some other thing, use the old distribution.\nI've never had any serious problem; but, at the same time, I've always been sure that in case of any problem (drivers, configuration, etc.), I could go back and use my old stable configuration as usual without any danger to my personal files.\n", "Q: Drivers for a Lexmark X4690 Have anyone got a Lexmark X4690 to work under Ubuntu?\nOr is the only option to install Windows on a VM?\n\nA: From lexmark here that particular printer is supported.\nDeb file can be downloaded from here\nAre you having any issues installing this printer - or is the above information the bit you were missing?\n", "Q: How can I change the scrollbar's background color for theme? I scanned the /home/ry/.themes/elementary-borderless/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml file and didn't spot anything. Where else can I look?\n\nA: Try in \"/usr/share/themes//gtk-2.0/\". The general file is gtkrc. Depending on how the theme is structured, it could include several other files. The naming convention appears to end in .rc, i.e. nautilus.rc or gedit.rc.\nRead these: \nhttp://live.gnome.org/GnomeArt/Tutorials/GtkThemes/GtkScrollbar\nhttp://developer.gnome.org/gtk/stable/GtkScrollbar.html\nYou might find something from there. \n\nA: If you still wanna know, look in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc – for example, for Ambiance theme. Search for style \"scrollbar\". Under the line engine \"murrine\", you can find such syntax:\n\ntrough_shades = {1.3, 1.2}\n\nIt seems to use default background color (defined as bg_color at the beginning of the file) and you just use a shade. These values for shades result in a color close to white – I’ve changed the shades to change gtk-2 scrollbar to something like overlay one. \nRemember, if you change the bg_color, all windows of all gtk-2 applications will be affected; so you may have better to try different values of shade. If you don't know, the values greater than 1 make the color lighter, and the smaller ones make darker.\n", "Q: Live USB faster than full install When I run 11.04 from a USB flash drive, it works the way I suspect it should - quick and responsive. With a full install, on the other hand, I click the home button and I have to wait four seconds to see the dash (this is insane - I have a core i5). Same thing with alt+F2. \nI've also tested the live USB on an older laptop with inferior specs and it still runs faster than my full install.\nWhat's going on? How do I fix this?\n\nA: The issue is the Unity settings in CCSM. The \"Dash Blur\" setting was set to \"Static Blur\". Changing that back to \"No Blur\" fixes the issue. I suppose this is why it's under the \"Experimental\" tab.\nBy the way, the list of PCI devices was the same and I did not try disabling OpenGL because I don't want to disable all the plugins that use it.\n\nA: It seems to be a problem with the video drivers/configs on the final install.

I'm a Kubuntu user moving to Unity, one nice feature that the KDE panel calendar (the one that pops up when you click on the clock) had is that it indicated my local public holidays. I think each holiday had a red square around it and when you clicked on it it showed the name of the holiday. \nCan this be set up with for the Unity panel calendar? \n\nA: The only possible solution I can think of is the following:\nEvolution, as I am aware, features synchronization with Google Calendar (I use Thunderbird myself so I cannot guarantee how well it works). Google Calendar has plenty of options, including subscribing to public calendars, amongst those I am sure there is one for your region's holidays. The solution would be subscribing to that specific calendar in GC, then synching the calendar with Evolution.

Informing about system updates seems like a perfect match for an indicator (it could appear or change color when there are new updates). Instead of that we have an annoying popup window, which demands immediate attention. I cannot imagine that nobody thought about that before, and it doesn't seem difficult to implement, so I assume there has to be a reason behind that?\n\nA: There is an indicator in 11.04. It shows gray for suggested updates and red for critical updates. It works in classic Gnome, and in Unity as well. I can't remember if it was in 10.10 or not.\n\nThe notification for updates is the sun-like icon in the middle. This is actually displayed because I have a package manager open, but the optional update icon is the same. It shows in red when there are critical updates. I don't see any settings under updates that control whether or not this is displayed, is I'm not sure why sure why you don't see it. I'm set for auto-download, manual install, but that shouldn't matter.\n\nA: I'm currently developing an application which does just what you asked for, mainly because the update management of ubuntu is not satisfactory for me:\n\nYou can download the sources at Launchpad (External downloads). It's in an early development stage and might still have bugs. But it works for me :-)\n", "Q: Formatting Pen Drive causes 'Daemon Is Inhibited' Error Am trying to format a drive with Disk Utility and everytime i try to format this pen drive i get 'Daemon Is Inhibited' error. How can it be solved since the pen drive works on other PCs with no problem.\nUPDATE\nThe device is not mounted.\nThe device is one of those usb pen drives with U3 support.\nIt is a Sandisk 8GB Pen drive with Fat32 Partition.\n\nA: First, per my comment make sure that the drive isn't mounted (in case it was automounted on plugin).\nUbuntu typically automounts in /media so you can check if anything is mounted in that directory either through nautilus (or any other FS browser) or with ls /media. unmount by running the command sudo umount /media/mount-point-name. You can also check to see if the drive is mounted by opening nautilus and looking at the panel to the left.\n \nAs you can see the drive \"Recovery\" is currently mounted, clicking on the eject symbol would unmount the drive. A third way to check would be to run the command df -h which lists mounted filesystems (the -h just displays the drive size in human readable form), if the drive is mounted somewhere other than /media or nautilus refuses to unmount you can use the information there to find where it is mounted. As shown in this screen shot, df tells me that the drive /dev/sda7 which is a 4.6GB filesystem is mounted at /media/Recovery \n\nOk, Now moving on. The \"standard\" filesystem for linux/unix (excluding OSX) is ext2. However, reading it on other platforms is a little problematic (requires extra drivers for OSX and windows). Ext3 and Ext4 support is even worse. Typically, drives that are required to be shared between different systems are formated in FAT32, the \"defacto\" universal filesystem. Disk Utility should be able to format Fat32 (make sure that is the filesystem you pick when prompted), but if the above steps fail to fix Disk Utility there are plenty of ways around it.\nPersonally I prefer to use gparted which is a fairly powerful partitioning utility (actually a GUI wrapper around parted). Install gparted by running sudo apt-get install gparted or by using ubuntu software center. Run gparted either through the terminal (sudo gparted - sudo because we need root privileges to modify filesystems) or a shortcut is typically under System->Administration->Gparted in the Ubuntu (non-unity) task bar. \n\nWith Gparted open, in the top right select the drive that corresponds to your USB drive.  If there are any filesystems on the drive (for me /dev/sda is the only drive and it has 5 partitions they will be listed in the area below. Delete all the partitions on the USB drive (right click on each one and select delete). What will be remaining is a \"unallocated\" partition the size of your drive, right click on it and select new.\n\nIn the popup box make the partition the full size of the drive and make sure to select FAT32 under filesystem. After closing the dialog, click the checkmark in the top right to write the changes to disk (NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU ARE MODIFYING THE RIGHT DRIVE, CHANGING THE PARTITION TABLE AND FORMATING OF YOUR MAIN DRIVE BY ACCIDENT COULD BE DISASTROUS)\nEDIT: If fat32 is not an available option for gparted/DiskUtility make sure that that the package dosfstools is installed.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu remember forever the password after the first time Is it possible to make Ubuntu remember the password for any program after the first time it asks. I get asked for the password for Synaptic, for making a usb bootable, for connecting to the wifi network, for opening gparted and even to go to the bathroom.\nIs there a way to just tell it to ask once forever or just tell it to not ask (Without going to root account. I want to keep using my own account)\n\nA: There is also the sudo configuration file, where you can allow applications to be started without password-query. How to use it, is described here: http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/man/1.8.0/sudoers.man.html\nWarning: Though very unlikely, messing with sudoers configuration could lock you out of your system or open doors for others. Always double check and be sure of what you're doing.\nAs a safety precaution you can open a root shell and keep it open until you have tested your changes. Open a shell and type sudo su, you will be asked for your password. Your shell is now a root shell. Also you can make a backup of your /etc/sudoers file to be able revert changes.\nThe basic use is you edit it by invoking visudo in shell:\nsudo select-editor # this is optional. it will allow you to select your default editor in shell\nsudo visudo\n\nThe latter of wich will open your shell default editor with the file. Normal syntax is:\nusername machine=(usernameToRunCommandAs) command1,command2,...\n\nas in:\nconfus confusion=(root) NOPASSWD:/sbin/halt,/sbin/reboot/usr/sbin/synaptic   #allows user confus to run \"sudo synaptic\" as root on confusion without password querry\nconfus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/sbin/halt,/sbin/reboot #allows confus to shutdown and reboot as all users on all machines without pw\n\nAs the $PATH variable is user dependent and sudo is not, the full path to the command is needed in sodoers list (note it says '/sbin/halt' not just 'halt'). You can find out the full path using the whereis command - as in whereis halt which will most likely return '/sbin/halt'.\nGenerelly speaking that's bad practise. You are asked for a reason. Installing software with synaptic ist potentially harmfull. As is tempering with partitions which can lead to an unbootable system and massive data loss. It also makes a hackers job much easier. But you're free to do it on your own risk.\n", "Q: Is blu-ray writing support reliable yet? Blu-ray writers have reduced in price a lot recently, but there are few success stories on the web about writing blu-ray disks using Ubuntu (and the same goes for GNU/Linux in general).\nAre any of the new low-cost blu-ray writers supported?  Can anybody confirm that they've personally used them with success?  What software did you use (I'm most interested in tools that operate at the hardware/protocol level, such as growisofs, rather than the GUI tools that wrap them)?\n\nA: I've so far found blu-ray writing using growisofs to Verbatim BD-R disks using an LG BH10LS30 blu-ray writer to be reliable.  I've only burned a small handful of disks so far, though.\n\nA: A new software seems to have a GUI for Bluray disc. It's Silicon Empire. You can install it in Ubuntu by downloading the package in the Downloads section, on the website.\n\nA: According to the cdrkit homepage, cdrecord has had Blu-Ray support since 2007. The homepages also states that all SCSI-3/mmc compliant drives and all ATAPI/mmc compliant drives are supported. I don't think there is a software issue. You should just look for a burner with good reviews.\n\nA: It is supported. Just needs some set up. See here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CdDvd/Burning#Blu-Ray_Burning\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu Wiki, it is possible, however, I have not tried myself. \nIt says \"The only available GUI in NeroLINUX. See Burning a DVD or Blu-Ray Disc below for command line instructions.\"\nFor playback, there is a post for that as well on the Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nA: My blu-ray writer works just fine on ubuntu with neroLinux. I have only written one disk but that is limited only by my lack of need for another blu-ray disk , it's not like i tried more that failed. (to be honest , i didn't even need to write the first one either - I just wanted to test my new notebook's blu-ray writer )\nSince i use a notebook though (Lifebook NH570 by Fujitsu) I can't give you an idea for a blu-ray writer so that you can buy one - unless you care about the model of the writer included in my notebook.\n", "Q: Internet extremely slow on a Ralink 2501USB Well everyone, after a long and through investigation into this it looks like I'm going to have to call it quits on this one. I've done just about everything suggested both from this site, and Google, but I seem to have no luck on this issue. I think Ubuntu just does not like the card that I have. Oh well, being a penny pincher has it's downsides.

Mass Storage Device (Multicard Reader)\n\n\nA: I've been having this strange problem a while ago on 10.10 as well: downloading files went as fast as on Windows, but browsing web pages went slower than on Windows. After a while, I found the solution myself: I had to turn off the 'share internet connection' option. I hope doing this will resolve your problem as well.\nPlease notice that the actual button names may differ, for I am using a Dutch version of Ubuntu. I'm not sure about the buttons' names in English.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the network icon on the upper bar of the screen\n\n*Click 'Edit Connections'\n\n*Select the internet connection that you're using, then click 'Edit...'\n\n*Untick the box 'Available for all users'\n\n*Click 'Save'\n\n\nYour browsing speed should now be as fast as in Windows XP.\nGood luck.\n\nA: The SpeedTest.net results seem equally terrible, so I suspect it might not be actually Internet connection speed issue. \nSpeedTest app is Flash. Linux version of Flash is much slower than Windows version. It's also very probable that the Flash version you have on Ubuntu is not the latest, which would make it even slower. That might be one of possible explications why the test take so long to start up, yet produce similar results. \n\nA: You could ping a common site like google.com to get an IP address. Then ping that ip without any name resolution at all.  Look at the round trip time for equally sized packets in both windows and ubuntu. If there is a significant difference then I would run traceroute(linux) and tracert(windows) and inspect the roundtrip times for each network hop. This will at least allow you to rule out anything your ISP is doing. If the bulk of the time is spent local to your network you at least have a next step.\n\nA: I solved a similar issue by signing up for a free OpenDNS account and then using their DNS nameservers (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220). You can specify DNS servers when you edit your connection under network manager. It significantly decreased the time it took to load webpages.\n\nA: I had almost similar experience. I noticed that whenever I am downloading something with Ubuntu, the browser crawls like snails just to open a page. Same thing occurs when I am updating thru the update manager. \nHowever when both of the tasks done, the browsing speed goes back to normal. I suspect that the Ubuntu is not 'dividing' the bandwidth equally (not sure what is the better terms for this lol).\nJust dont browse while you are downloading. That is what I did.\n\nA: Bufferbloat could be to blame here. Run this command in a terminal, then try the speed test again.\nsudo ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 0\n(Change to wlan0 txqueuelen 50 if you have wireless.)\nThis causes the Linux's transmit buffer for this interface to be really small. This seems counter-intuitive, but TCP/IP has built-in load adjustment and the network card has its own buffer. Some (bad) wireless cards...do not like having a buffer of 0. This causes your internet to more quickly handle latency and load changes, because it doesn't wait for the buffer to fill up before slowing itself down.\nThis most greatly affects latency under load which you will have while gaming.\nThis will NOT persist past a reboot - you can just set the queue length back to 1000 if you want the old behavior.\n", "Q: Switching to Chrome in 11.10? I just read an article that said Ubuntu is switching to Chrome for 11.10. Is this true and if so, is it going to be Chrome or Chromium???\n\nA: Firefox will still be the default Web Browser in 11.10. While it was proposed that Chrome or Chromium would replace it, the end decision was that Firefox would remain as default in 11.10 when it was discussed (or rather set to discuss, but then the discussion was canceled, automatically keeping things the same) at the Ubuntu Developer Summit.\nAlso it was set to be Chromium since it is fully open source and Google Chrome has some proprietary code in it.\n", "Q: Accessing my Windows 7 files from my Ubuntu account I have just installed Ubuntu on my computer and I have windows 7 as my other operating system. is there a way that I can access my windows 7 files from my Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: Absolutely! Just open up Nautilus the file manager by clicking the Home Icon. On the left hand side of Nautilus you should see a drive symbol that will have a name relating to \"windows\" or the size of the partition such as \"125GB filesystem\" (where 125GB is the size of your windows partition). Click that to mount your windows partition and access all your files. A visual guide is located here.\n", "Q: What is the application of JRE in LibreOffice? Initially when I installed Natty, JRE was not installed for libreoffice. Later I came to know installing JRE i.e., libreoffice-java-common will lead to performance improvements. So installed it and in LO options selected enable java runtime. But I noticed a heavy degradation in the performance. LO was taking more time to load, scrolling through pages became very slow and what not!\nSo now I wonder what purpose does JRE in LO serve?\n\nA: From the OpenOffice wiki:\n\nJava is required for complete OpenOffice.org functionality. Java is mainly required to use the new embedded Java technology based HSQLDB database engine, or to make use of accessibility and assistive technologies. If you do not require database tables or accessibility integration or some wizards, then you do not need to download and install Java. Base (the database component) for example completely relies on Java technologies to run, but other programs (like Writer, Calc, and Impress) only need Java for special functionality.\n\n\nA: For details, see the Ask LibreOffice question What features absolutely require Java ? which hopefully will track the current status.\nThere are some projects to replace the current Java dependencies, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice Wizards: Java to Python conversion : Blueprints : Ubuntu\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-libreoffice-python-wizards\n\n*Bug 38811 – [EasyHack] default to SQLite not HSQLDB in Base\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38811\n", "Q: How can I disable Caps Lock on text-mode (tty) terminals? I have disabled caps lock in Ubuntu via the System Settings -> Keyboard panel (see How to programmatically swap the caps lock and esc keys? on how to find this option), however when I switch to a text-mode tty terminals (through Ctrl + Alt + F1) caps lock is no longer disabled.\nI use these text-based terminals a fair amount - is there a way to completely disable Caps Lock, even on these terminals?\n\nA: I had success using the instructions posted on this blog in a virtual console:\necho -e \"$(dumpkeys | grep ^keymaps)\\nkeycode 58 = Escape\" | sudo loadkeys\n\nI'm not sure how to apply this automatically after every reboot, though.\n\nWhile researching your question, I also ran across this alternative solution:\n\n\nA: Adding the following line to .profile or .bash_profile should disable caps lock:\nxmodmap -e \"remove lock = Caps_Lock\"\n\n", "Q: Asogiate won't work on 11.04. How do I fix that? Asogiate is a filetype editor (MIME), and on 11.04 if gives an error about the database being malformed, then won't work.

I just did a clean installation of Natty on my laptop, and I must say it is fantastic! I was apprehensive about Unity at first, but I have very quickly changed my mind. \nNow with that said, my laptop is my testing machine, and my desktop is my super-stable-don't-change-anything machine. I'm impressed with the usability and stability of Unity on my laptop, but my desktop uses Dual monitors and I'm not sure how well that is supported at the moment. \nDoes anyone have any comments on using 11.04 with Dual monitors and how well it will work? First hand experiences or very recent links? All the research I have done on my own has only led to old (October) posts, and bug reports that appear to have been fixed so I would like to know from people who are actively running the final release of 11.04.\nMy graphics card is an nVidia GTX 460, which has been well supported on 10.04 and 10.10. Also my primary (slightly larger) monitor is to the right, but I'm not picky about which one I stare at.\n\nA: Have been running Ubuntu 11.04 on a brand new Lenovo Edge laptop for a few days now, and I am totally satisfied with everything except for dual monitor support.  \nIt worked great yesterday when I first hooked up my second monitor, but today, after booting with the same monitor still connected, I ran into problems after opening both pidgin and Thunderbird.  The program panes would disappear when I tried to drag or re-size them and eventually I couldn't get them back even with the workspace switcher.  I played with dual monitor settings a bit, and then had both screens go left even when they had Normal selected.  This was easy enough to fix, but I actually had to unplug the second monitor on order to regain control of my program panes.  \nAfter arranging my panes to my liking, I plugged the second monitor back in and this time it was black except for the top status bar.  Back into the settings and things got worse.  I rebooted with the second monitor unplugged, and when I plugged it back in things were wonky again.  I'd really like to just reset the factory dual monitor configuration so I can get it working again like it was yesterday.  I think that if I boot with the factory configuration and then plug in the second monitor I should be fine, although that would be a slightly annoying workaround, and I can't see how to restore the factory dual monitor config.\n\nA: My only problem with dual monitors is that Unity wants them to both be the same size - and they're not. That screws up the top panel on the 2nd monitor, but other than that it seems to work pretty well. I'm hoping they fix it one day, but until then I'm still using it.\nedit: Note: Using nvidia gear/drivers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu - any good method to know which package contains the specified app? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I find the package that provides a file? \n\nMy mount utility doesn't support ext4, so I plan to update it.\nHow to determine which package contain an app, such as mount?\nsudo apt-get install \n\nA: sudo apt-get install apt-file\nsudo apt-file search <filename>\n\nWhat version of ubuntu are you using?

Hey all, I Dual-boot using a NTFS partition to house shared docs and some program files between Windows and Ubuntu. When this extra media partition isn't mounted automatically at startup it causes usability problems. In the past I have installed and used \"NTFS Configuration Tool\" to achieve this. Since I just cleanly installed ubuntu 11.04, I thought it would be fitting to ask if anyone has found a better method?\n\nA: From what i can gleen from the question, you should add the device to the fstab for auto mounting at boot time.

This has to be done in a format understood by the strftime function. You can look it up here. \nFor example, if you want the date/time to look like this: Fri, 20. May 08:25, the format string for it would be %a, %d. %h  %H:%M. Now let's set it:\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.datetime custom-time-format \"'%a, %d. %h  %H:%M'\"\n\nGUI method\nYou can also set those keys using a GUI called dconf-editor. It's part of the package dconf-tools, which you'd need to install first by running sudo apt-get install dconf-tools. Then open dconf-editor, navigate to com.canonical.indicator.datetime, and set the two keys.\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04. I don't want to install dconf-editor.\nI just tried the following in a terminal:\n$ gsettings set com.canonical.indicator.datetime custom-time-format \"'%a %Y%m%d-%H%M%S'\"\n$ \n\nAs you can see, there are no error messages or anything.\nI then log out and log back in, but there has been no change to my clock display, which is currently %a %b %e %Y %T.\n", "Q: How can I view a live volume meter?

I have tried searching around, and it looks like VMWare ESX-i does, but I'm not too certain about VirtualBox.\nThank you!\n\nA: The issue is really about whether the drivers for your specific 10 GE NIC are included in the desktop kernel.

Then while using the terminal I noticed that once I quit a terminal session its history is gone, although history exists for applications in terminal like-ROOT(CERN) history. \nIn giving the command\necho $HISTFILESIZE \n\nit shows 2000. I changed that to 10000 when I quit the session and opened a new terminal; it again shows history as 2000 and no command can be accessed through up/down arrow key.\nPlease help. I am getting frustrated with soooo....  lot of typing in the terrminal.\n\nA: If no commands can be run using ↑ or ↓ that indicates that your history file is empty or you have no read-permissions. Check that.\nMaybe you run the commands as another user. If so do:\nsu otheruser\nhistory 10\n\nand look at the output.\nIf you change $HISTFILESIZE the changes will be overwritten, whenever you invoke an other shell. To prevent that you should change that variable in your .bashrc. Also you should set the variable $HISTSIZE  to a larger value.\nGenerally usefull tips using histories:\nCtrl+R does a reverse search of your history for you. Alt+. pastes the last argument of the last command into your prompt at cursor position.\nAlso the bang (!) operator will repeat commands for you in terminal (if it's just about saving you some typing. Example:\nconfus@confusion:~$ echo \"bang + letters will repeat the last command starting with these letters.\"\nbang + letters will repeat the last command starting with these letters.\n\nconfus@confusion:~$ clear\n\nconfus@confusion:~$ !ech\nbang + letters will repeat the last command starting with these letters.\n\nAll those histroy related things are stored in the home directory of any user in a file called .bash_history. You can look them up by using the history-command. Her is a small tutorial on howto use history.\nconfus@confus:~$ history 4 #will print last 4 commands\n 1848  ls\n 1849  clear\n 1850  vi /home/confus/.local/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop\n 1851  history 4\n\nAnother very usefull thing is to create a .inputrc file in your home directory with the following content:\n\"\\e\\e[C\": forward-word\n\"\\e\\e[D\": backward-word\n\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward\n\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward\n\nThis way you can use the ↑ or ↓ to complete commands you started to type from history. E.g. when you type a rather lenghty command such as rsync -a -v --human-readable --prune-empty-dirs -e 'ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa' --include=\"*/\" --exclude=\"snapshot_*\" --exclude=\"restart.*\" /scratch/ x@cluster1:/home/x/runs/ and want to run it a second time you can just type rsy and then ↑ an it will complete to the last command that started with rsy. Another press of the uparrow will complete to the second-last and so on. I don't know why this isn't the default.\n\nA: You can press Control+R and search through your bash history if you remember a part of the command you entered. \nThere is also a file called .bash_history in your home folder that you can open or grep to find your previously entered commands.\n", "Q: How do I install the experimental 3d Nvidia drivers? they used to show up as available for download in Jockey/additional-drivers but now the option is no longer there.\n\nA: For installing and running the latest experimental and thus possibly unstable video drivers you could add the xorg-edgers ppa to your sources and install from there.\nPlease find the time to read the release notes including notes on how to remove this ppa in case your video output becomes unstable\n", "Q: Apt-get ignoring a repo even if I clear the cache I'm trying to get the ubuntugis repo to install on a server and I keep getting the line:\nIgn http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu/ lucid/main Translation-en_GB\n\nwhen I do an apt-get update.\nThis is not correct behaviour.

At the point where Gparted should allow me to select partitions I could not see my Windows partitions with Vista and XP installed on them. It was written that the disk has no operating systems installed. \nAfter googling I found out that this behavior may be caused by SATA drive with suggestions to change settings in BIOS. My BIOS does not provide means to change such settings. Has anyone here encountered the similar problem? Any suggestions how to install ubuntu? I have two partitions on my HDD and about 35GB of unallocated space.\n\nA: Before you begin I recommend understanding what a partition is and the tools available under linux. http://www.ibiblio.org/ is a very good resource.. I expect the problem is related to a partition type being marked as type hidden.  \nYou could use to gdisk(gpt-fdisk) get information on your paritions. I would get the latest version, I think that is 0.7. The creator of the tool has excellent documentation on how disk partion structures and information is set up and can be changed. I recently changed a disk structure I had created as gpt to mbr to fix a problem with windows not wanting to install on a disk. gdisk could probably fix your problem by recreating the mbr in a format that would make it accessible to your Linux system. \nTestdisk should be installed as well. Testdisk is one of the best tools for fixing partition problems and I have used it numerous times.  This might be simpler to use, but it is not as informative as to what is going on with your actual disk structures. I would use gdisk to find out what is going on and then use testdisk to see if you can make the changes that allow you to resize your partitions. \nYou can change your disk partition labels with fdisk and parted as well. The first step is to get the actual structure of your disk and make a back up. So that you can fix problems, and later go back if you need to. Use dd or diskdump command explained here at the bottom of the page. \nMicrosoft has this documentation that might help\nI have found this problem with windows 7 and vista pre-installed on certain computers. My solution was to format the drives under Linux and reinstall MSwin afterwards. In one case I removed the hard drive put it into an external casing because Linux could not even see the drive to format it. I believe the bios was protecting the hard drive. Some thing the manufactures set up to prevent people making changes. \nI expect your are not afraid to read. There is no short answer to your problem with out more specific information. I hope this will get you up to a point where you understand the problem and what tools you have to solve it. If you need help with a specific problem / tool post back and update your question. \n\nA: Often the cause of this is rooted in windows. Boot to XP - go to my computer - right click C Drive - go to properties - find check drive for errors (I am working on memory as I only have Ubuntu on my system) - there will be two boxes to tick - tick the top box only - tell the computer to fix errors - It cannot, so it will ask you to do it on next boot - agree and reboot. You should get a dos environment and it will perform three checks (Five if you ticked both boxes AND take a long time). After this use your live CD and go to gparted. You should see your drives now. You MAY need to repeat this on all your drives.\nGood luck - Mal\n\nA: I'm going with an unsupported HD controller.  Install with wubi or in a VM.

If it is local you will not be able to connect to it except rerouting from the Internet IP assign to that network.\nClass C IP are for example: 192.168.0.1 (Common one used in cafes) 192.168.1.10 and tipically any 192.168.X.X\nIn your question the ip 192.168.1.46 is Class C which is not accessible by normal means except rerouting connections.\nThe other ip 122.XXX.XXX.XXX is an Internet IP which will work\nWhat i recommend is telling the router that connects to the Internet (The one that has the 122.XXX.XXX.XXX) to redirect all connections to that port to the 192.168.1.46 IP in the network.\n\nA: You need to NAT the servers internal IP address to a public Internet address. Not sure what type of router/gateway you are using, but for most home users this is a matter of enabling a specific IP to act as the DMZ host and then use some form of dynamic DNS to make the name public. For businesses you would want to work with your IP on getting a static IP address that is public and providing your firewall rules are setup to accept TCP/22.  \n\nA: Will elaborate later. Just a list of key points for now:\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh port forwarding (in router or internet gateway; usually port 22)\n\n*Iptables\n\n\nA: You probably need to go to your router's web interface and forward port 22 to 192.168.1.46. Looking at the addresses you mentioned, you should go to http://192.1681.1.1/ in a web browser and look for a Port forwarding page. You might look at http://portforward.com/ and see if your router is on there. If so, there should be directions on how to forward ports for your specific router.\nI would also like to point out that once you get port forwarding set up, you will still have to use the internal address, 192.168.1.46, to ssh in from the local network (behind the 192.168.1.1 router) and use the external address, 122.XXX.XXX.XXX, to login from everywhere else. This is because NAT is just really an ugly kludge to save IPv4 addresses (and therefore doesn't do very well with the model of having a server behind it). A 'hairpin' NAT would fix this, but most NAT implementations aren't hairpin. (I wish we could just use IPv6 and get rid of NAT already so we wouldn't have little confusing problems like this!)\n\nA: I think the problem is with the firewall, try something like:\niptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n", "Q: FN keys not working on an HP G62 laptop.

It currently does all of your dot points except for \"felt temperature\" and \"warn of rain\" (unless you consider notifications as sufficent warning of weather changes).  You can install indicator-weather from the Ubuntu repositories, but I would strongly recommend getting the latest version from our PPA ppa:weather-indicator-team/ppa - it has lots of bug fixes.  The devs are currently working on a new version (foggy) that will be very pretty, and bring back \"felt temperature\" - with 4 different types!\nMy-Weather-Indicator currently does have \"felt temperature\" and moon phases (and dew point etc), but in my very biased opinion it is not as polished as indicator-weather.\n", "Q: Why do I need to republish a file when I update it? I am coding a program and at the same time, I want to share it with my group members using ubuntu. They don't have an Ubuntu One account and what I do is to publish the file and my friends just get the link and the file.\nBut, strangely or not, every time I upload a new version of this file (I add more code and save it), the used link seems to be \"outdated\" and I need to publish the same file again and to get a new link every time I modify the same file.\nCouldn't it be possible to save a new version of your file and the same link just \"points\" to the newer version?\n\nA: From Chipaca's (Ubuntu One dev) answer to a similar question:\n\nHowever, if you edit it with an editor that renames the file, creates a new one, copies the content in and then deletes the original (as most editors do), and syncdaemon is running, it will see the rename and the delete and your public URL will refer first to the renamed file, and then will disappear.\nThis is an unfortunate side-effect of the way we're doing public files, and something we need to change, but right now this is what it is.\n\nBasically, when you save a file with most editors, you are actually replacing the original file with the modified version. You can see for yourself using the stat command:\nhello@world:~$ stat -c %i hello.txt\n4971\n\nThe command stat -c %i returns the inode number of a file.\nRunning that same command again after I have edited hello.txt in gedit\nreturns a different inode number:\nhello@world:~$ stat -c %i hello.txt\n3794\n\nIf I simply append a line of text to the end of the file using >> the file is simply modified in place, not overwritten:\nhello@world:~$ echo \"The End.\" >> hello.txt\nhello@world:~$ stat -c %i hello.txt\n3794\n\nI have found a slightly awkward way to get around this limitation in Ubuntu One:\n\n*\n\n*Create a copy of the published file:\n cp hello.txt hello-copy.txt\n\n\n\n*Do all of your work on the copy instead of the published file:\n gedit hello-copy.txt\n\n\n\n*When you want to update the published file, run the following command:\n cat hello-copy.txt > hello.txt\n\n", "Q: How do I load iptable kernel modules onto a VPS? I have two servers, using one for prod and one for dev.  They are with different providers, and one is running Xen and the other OpenVZ (both running Ubuntu but 8.04 and 10.10 respectively).  I've been having an issue with the OpenVZ server setting up my iptables because apparently its missing some kernel modules.  When I run lsmod | grep ip I get these results:\nXen-\n$ lsmod | grep ip\nipt_LOG                 8192  1 \nnf_conntrack_ipv4      21904  2 \nnf_conntrack           79344  2 nf_conntrack_ipv4,xt_state\nipt_REJECT              6528  3 \niptable_filter          4608  1 \nip_tables              24232  1 iptable_filter\nx_tables               23432  6 ipt_LOG,xt_limit,xt_tcpudp,xt_state,ipt_REJECT,ip_tables\nipv6                  313384  18 \nmultipath              11008  0 \nmd_mod                 89500  6 raid10,raid456,raid1,raid0,multipath,linear\n\nOpenVZ-\nBLANK, there is nothing returned...\nSo my questions are, 1) Why am I getting nothing returned for the OpenVZ server, and 2) How do I load the necessary modules?\n\nUPDATE:\nThis is the result of trying modprobe\n$ modprobe nf_conntrack\nWARNING: Deprecated config file /etc/modprobe.conf, all config files belong into /etc/modprobe.d/.\nFATAL: Module nf_conntrack not found.\n\n\nA: It turns out that I am unable to load kernel modules to a container, since all containers on OpenVZ platforms use the same kernel (unlike Xen).  What I needed to do was get in touch with my provider and have them enable iptables for me.  After that all rules worked.\nFunny thing is I still don't have any output by typing lsmod | grep ip and there still doesn't seem to be any kernel folder in my /lib/modules/$(uname -r) folder.  I guess this is not accessible from within a container.\n", "Q: Can't ping Ubuntu laptop from my LAN My laptop has Ubuntu 10.10 and is connected to my router with full internet access, yet I can't ping it from other computers on my LAN. I tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can successfully ping those other computers from my Ubuntu laptop, so I didn't accidentally connect to someone else's network.\n\n*I can successfully ping my Ubuntu laptop from itself, though I don't know if that means anything.\n\n*I haven't messed with iptables at all, so it currently doesn't have any rules set that would cause it to reject anything.\n\n*I made a DHCP reservation for my laptop's MAC address in my router to make sure I was always using the correct IP address.\n\n\nPlease note that I am using a \"command line only\" install of Ubuntu, so I can't use any GUI network config tools. The reason I want to ping it is because I am trying to run an NFS server on the laptop, yet despite correctly setting it up I cannot access the NFS volume on another computer because it isn't even visible on the network right now.\n\nA: You don't mention whether or not you attempted to ping via hostname or ip address.  If by hostname, WINS is not a standard part of Linux (esp a basic install), so most consumer routers and Windows boxes won't be able to connect via hostname.  Your router may have a method of manually setting hostnames to a specific MAC or IP address, which could solve the problem.  If you have all Linux boxes and are having the problem, try defining the names in /etc/hosts.  Finally, try installing WINS if that's the route you like (part of SAMBA): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaServerGuide \n\nA: Not a solution, but a diagnostic tool: try to reach your computer via TCP to rule out the case that something funky is going on with ICMP packets. On the receiving host run\nnc -l 8090\n\nwhile on the other, run\necho hi | nc ip.of.computer 8090\n\nOf course you need to replace of.of.computer with the computer's ip address such as 192.168.0.101. If all goes well, you should see \"hi\" in the output of the computer you're trying to reach. If not, there is something wrong with your routing or a firewall is blocking incoming packets.\n", "Q: What is a \"viewport\"? What about a \"workspace\"? Is a viewport different from a workspace? What's the distinction? It seems like the terms get used interchangeably. \nI'm trying to accomplish something that other people have been stabbing at for a while -- I have a script that launches a bunch of programs at once and I'd like to launch them in a specific workspace. The question's been asked:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/35678/how-can-i-start-a-program-in-a-different-workspace\nHow to run a custom set of programs in a specific workspace?\nBut the answers hop between talking about \"viewports\" and \"workspaces\" -- how are they different?\n\nA: Window Managers (like metacity) assume that each workspace is a discrete entity. Windows are either on one or another workspace. Think of this as several physical desks.\nCompiz works differently. It uses something called a viewport, into one workspace. This is what allows you to have windows overlapping the edge of the cube. Think of this as one big physical desk, but where you can only see one part of it at a time.\nAnd regarding getting programs to launch on another workspace or viewport (depending on what window manager you use): there is a programm called wmctrl that allows you to switch from command line.\nIf you want something fancy with compiz/viewports have a look at this script. It uses wmctrl and accepts you telling it things like 'goto ViewportNumber 1'.\n", "Q: What SSD support changes are there in 11.04?

I see that my 'lamp' directive is failing, but that's because the machine is currently down.\n\nA: If it doesn't at boot and works fine after boot, it's entirely possible that the network isn't available at the time the mount is done. Networking comes up at login these days so this seems likely.\nTwo solutions to fix this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should be able to add _netdev to your list of mount options. This forces the mount to wait for a network interface to come up. Win.\n\n*Usurp the boot stack and configure your own network card. If it's a simple ethernet connection whacking something like this in /etc/network/interfaces might work:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nIt's a little messier but this is what Ubuntu used to do. And it works for me.\nIf in doubt try both.

For me it seems impossible that a CPU that is idling should produce a heat of 72 degree celcius. Do you mean by idling on the os is running or did you check the load of the CPU?\nInstall powertop from synaptics and start the programm in the terminal by \"sudo powertop\" the programm will tell what the CPU is really doing. It tells you also which activities keeps the CPU busy. \n\nA: Have you checked your CPU Frequency?\nUsually my laptop only heats up when the frequency is higher than normal for extended periods.\nYou can control the frequency by adding the \"cpu frequency applet\" to the panel (if you are using gnome).\n\nA: Install jupiter, either jupiter or acpi=off, it completely stopped my  power hogging problem. \nacpi= off  stopped most of it  but with jupiter installed it has never come back. The freq scaling applets  don't always  stay on the panel for me.\n\nA: I see two possibilities.  One is that your board's ACPI stuff doesn't work properly(the fan doesn't spool any faster under load).  Try acpi=off on the kernel line.  Another possibility is that the kernel is tuned to a higher than normal polling frequency(as some users suggest in youtube videos to make the desktop more responsive...imho a fail).  If you aren't using a stock kernel, use one.  If you are, try with acpi disabled.  If your fans are louder but your temp stays lower file a bug or accept it.  \nJust my 2 cents.\n\nA: Had the same issue in my Dell inspiron with dual boot. \nI tried jupiter which brought down the temperatures a little and i tried acpi=off which by the way caused one of my processor cores not show up in ubuntu. The problem was eventually tracked down to faulty display drivers with the radeon GPU. Ater failed attempts of installing the amd catalyst display driver the only remedy i found was to turn\n off the radeon GPU, which  brings the temperature down to values comparable to windows 7 in idle.\nDetailed steps of turning off the GPU can be found here:\nHow do I turn off the Radeon GPU on my HP Pavilion DM4?\n", "Q: Not able to connect to internet using my wired network connection on my Dell inspiron N1401 laptop I bought my new Dell N1401 inspiron laptop, installed Ubuntu 11.04.

'error in Version string 'svn3799ppa1~maverick1' version number does not start with digit'\nthis message is shown each time during the package installation in gnome3 upgrade. Why this message is coming and will this cause a errors in other programs??\n\nA: I did a google search for the version number and the only reference I came up with was for a PPA for a program called Handbrake.  Did the part of the error message you didn't include in the question mention that package?\nAssuming this is the case, it looks like the packages in this PPA had a weird naming convention.  The owner of the PPA has since changed them slightly such that it shouldn't trigger this error, but it isn't clear that the new packages would be considered newer than the old broken ones.\nIf that is so, I would suggest removing the handbrake package and seeing if that allows you to install the other updates:\nsudo apt-get remove handbrake\n\nIf everything upgrades correctly after doing that, you could try installing the package again (which should hopefully give you a version without a broken version number).\n", "Q: Mouse dead zone that makes it impossible to click?

This may not work for all applications, since the libraries are not exactly the same.\nTo do this in a 32-bit system enter:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.5 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.3\n\nIn a 64-bit system it would be:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.5 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.3\n\nIf unsure, you can find the library on your system like this:\nlocate -b libtiff\n\nThen you will be able to get the path correct (if you just installed libtiff5, you have to first do sudo updatedb for locate to find it)\n\nA: If Maya was not built on your machine (i.e. installed from a binary) then you need libtiff3, libtiff4 will not fix your issue as it includes \"libtiff.so.4\", not \"libtiff.so.3\".

I've just tried playing a DVD on the same computer running Windows 7 and there was no issue. So now I'm just confused. I assumed the error message at boot indicated a hardware issue, but Windows doesn't seem to care. So I guess it's just Ubuntu that has an issue.\n\nA: To make your drive region free you need to flash new firmware onto it so that the drive itself will not check the region.  This is knows as RPC1, search for  rpc1.org.  New drives won't read \"out of region\" DVDs.\n\nA: I'm going to guess it's a quirk with the SATA chipset on your motherboard and this drive that Windows has sorted but Linux has not yet.\nPlease respond with some more information about your hardware, and perhaps update your BIOS. It might be initializing the hardware incorrectly.\nAlso, start with CDs that you know aren't non-standard or drm-ified. DVDs have region lock; non-standard CDs introduce errors or do things to freak out DVD drives (certain drives don't read DVD-RW's in certain modes as some sort of rudimentary anti-copying measure) but a standard Audio CD is usually a lowest common denominator.\n\nA: After booting into Windows and playing a disc there, the drive started to work in Ubuntu. Someone suggested that this is because Windows set the drive's region code.

I managed to find:\ncatch(Exception e)\n{\nByteArrayOutputStream file = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nPrintStream stream = new PrintStream(file);\ne.printStackTrace(stream);\nSystem.out.println(\"The result is :\"+file.toString().trim());\n}\n\nwhich helped me to find this:\nError:\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:205)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:321)\n        at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:294)\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:266)\n        at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\n        at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:186)\n        at prog_users.main(prog_users.java:24)\n\nSo the main error is that the classpath for crontab cannot find the jdbc driver!\nNow... how do I change the CLASSPATH for a process that has no home directory or .rcbash...?\n\nA: Cron will mail you the output of all jobs it runs, so make sure that on failure your program outputs enough information so that you can diagnose the problem.\nWhen your your Java program fails, print at least the exception stack trace to the standard error stream and exit with a non-zero exit code:\ntry {\n    // your code here\n    // ...\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n    System.exit(1);\n}\n\nAlso, check that your mail delivery is set up correctly, so that you will receive the mails that cron sends you.\n\nA: Solution:\nJukka's hint about the StackTrace tipped me off on the solution, so a good majority of the credit goes to him for helping me find the solution.\n\nSo basically, I was working on this problem with a windows frame of mind. I figured that since I set the CLASSPATH in Root (which crontab was running from), that the CLASSPATH would be defined. However, for Linux this is not the case - crontab needs to have the CLASSPATH set.\nwhich led me to:\nIn the java program, I replaced the \n}catch(Exception e){\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nwith\n}catch(Exception e){\n    ByteArrayOutputStream file = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    PrintStream stream = new PrintStream(file);\n    e.printStackTrace(stream);\n    System.out.println(\"The result is :\"+file.toString().trim());\n}\n\nso that my log file would actually SHOW the error output in the logfile when run from crontab.\n\nSo, on to the solution:\nCreate a script in /home/user/java called script1\nscript1:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-5.1.10.jar\njava -cp $CLASSPATH:/home/user/java myprogram > /home/user/java/user_logfile.txt\n\nThen used sudo chmod 0755 /home/user/java/script1 to make it executable.\n--   --    --    --    --\nThen replace the crontab line:\n  30 14 *  *  * java -cp $CLASSPATH:/home/user/java myprogram > /home/user/java/user_logfile.txt\n\nwith:\n  30 14 *  *  * /home/user/java/script1\n\n", "Q: UPS Compatibility with Ubuntu Server I'm looking into getting battery backup unit to protect my Ubuntu server. How can I find out if it is compatible with Ubuntu (11.04)?\nIdeally I'd like to be able to tell the server when there is a power outage so the server can shutdown. I know most of them come with software that works with Windows, but haven't seen any that mention Linux or Ubuntu. \nAre there any good resources for setting up UPS's with Ubuntu? Any recommendations?\n\nA: One of the most popular UPS companies is APC.\nTo monitor and powerdown my server I have been using apcupsd which has lots of options and a comprehensive userguide for setting it up. It has worked well with my APC Smart-UPS 700VA for many years.\nYou may find that you need to spend a bit more to get a UPS unit that has a serial/usb cable to communicate power status with the server.\n\nA: I recommend using Network UPS Tools (NUT) - an open-source library of software and drivers which support a vast variety of UPS devices.\nWhile much of the support in this project relies on unofficial / reverse-engineered compatibility, it seems to be much simpler to install and configure rather than using the proprietary software and drivers provided by the OEM.\nThe biggest benefit to NUT is that many OEM's force you to purchase a very expensive UPS just to get a device having compatibility with their management software on Linux. Because of this, most entry-level devices will only communicate with the watered-down Windows software they provide. NUT provides this capability to Linux users without needing the official software.\nAPC and CyberPower are two of the most popular hardware OEMs for UPS. If you browse NUT's website, you'll see a list of all compatible OEMs and models. From what I've seen, many people have reported success with NUT even on models not listed on the website.\nOne last important thing: Make sure the UPS supports USB (communication, not just charging) or Ethernet. Many entry-level devices may have no means of communication, others will use connections less common (RS-232) in consumer products, and some will require you to purchase a network card to add Ethernet.\n", "Q: Is there a way to move/remove \"system settings\" from the shut-down menu? In 11.04 \"System settings\" is at the bottom of window and when I try to shut down the computer I always click that instead of the shut down button.\nSo is there a way to remove this system settings button?!\n\n\nA: Yes, you can easily disable it by running the following from a gnome-terminal:\nsudo rm /usr/share/indicators/session/applications/gnomecc.desktop\n\nThis will simply delete the link to the GNOME Control Center. Then logout/login or restart. Should be away after that ;-)\nHowever, it will be in a different way in Oneiric as replied here by Mr. Shuttleworth himself. ;-)\n", "Q: What programs/distro are being run in these screenshots? Stumbling across (literally, via stumbleupon) I found some very cool linux desktop screenshots, and one was a screenshot of terminator from a question asked on this website. The bottom-left corner features a task manager/system monitor of sorts running in a terminal, what is the command to open this?\n\nIn this other picture, (from linuxkungfu.org) someone has a screenshot of a -very- sexy looking, nerdy tech desktop with what I'm guessing are transparent? terminals running various programs, and what looks like an IRC program front + center....can anyone tell me what distro this individual is using? \n\n\nA: The command you want that is shown in the bottom left of this screenshot is top\n\n\nA: Yeah, look at the star at the left-bottom. It's mandrake. Mutt is used for Mail, and Irssi for IRC. If you see some of the e-mails they discuss topics for the year 2004. It wasn't until 2005 when Mandrake joined Conectiva to become Mandriva.\nSo it's an old Mandrake distro ;-) I guess it's Mandrake 10\n\nA: 1st image:\nTop left and the right hand side are normal command line images;\nAt the bottom right it shows top. It should be installed on your system. Otherwise sudo apt-get install top to install it. There is an alternative version of top called htop (sudo apt-get install htop) that has some nice extras. Comparison of the 2:\ntop and htop:\n\nThe 2nd image is from Mandrake. mutt is a command line email program that also let's you use attachments. You can also use mutt in Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install mutt. If you have mail set up on your system mutt will use that otherwise you will also need to set mail up yourself.\n", "Q: How to make Update-Manager working  I bought my wife a Laptop and installed ubuntu 10.04 as I was tired to answer all her questions about the stupid windows messages \"want to do this and that ...\" Of course I advertised Ubuntu as a super stable system and so on.\nThe amount of questions dropped significantly, however unfortunately the update manager doesn't work. It shows the updates, you tell the machine to install, password, it updates and shows you the same updates you should install. Of course she is teasing me. Upgrade via terminal works. I deinstalled and reinstalled the updatemanager, no change.\n\nA: To further reduce messages from Update Manager we have the option to install security updates silently in the background. This is done by choosing System Administration -> Update Manager -> Settings -> Updates:\n\nBy selecting Install security updates without confirmation all security updates will be downloaded and installed without user interaction.\nIn case you need to install non-security application's updates tick the appropriate options for Recommended Updates or Unsupported Updates and let Update Manager Download all updates in the background. Then you can manually install these updates at a convenient time. \nThough not recommended further reducing on update frequency may be acchieved by increasing the Check for Updates from Daily to Weekly or more.\n", "Q: Why are my fonts bold? Sorry for the large screenshot, but I wanted to include everything that's here:\n\nWhy are my fonts bold in both Chromium and Firefox?\n(I have not modified any font settings in Chromium or Firefox; this is a fresh install.)\n\nA: This is likely a problem with manual installation of fonts. Install MS fonts from ttf-mscorefonts-installer package to ensure all font files are installed, and if you installed these fonts manually, remove them from your personal fonts folder (~/.fonts).\n\nA: On Chrome go to Preferences>Advanced>Web Content , you will be presented with the respective options to change them.\n\nI don't know 'bout Firefox though.\n\nA: I see this thread is almost two years old but I'm posting my workaround for others to use:\nI had the same exact problem with Chrome on Ubuntu 12.10. I installed the Roboto font in ~/.fonts (all 16 fonts). Even though I set everything to \"Roboto Light\" under gnome-tweak-tool, Chrome was still using Black (or Bold).\nTo fix it: I deleted all Roboto fonts except for the Light variant and it started to work properly. Perhaps you should try this, removing the other variants of \nStill unsure why Chrome did this, but perhaps it just sees \"Roboto\" has the font and picks the first file in the folder?\n\nA: For me the solution for bold fonts in Google Chrome was\nrm -rf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/roboto\n\nI've installed the Roboto fonts myself a long time ago. The location should be the same if you haven't copied it manually. I'm using Mint 17.\n", "Q: Is using Ubuntu Minimal any different from Server? I am wondering if there is any difference between the installation methods of Ubuntu minimal and server. \n\nA: *\n\n*Minimal CD installation:\n\n\nThe Minimal CD will download packages from online archives at installation time instead of providing them on the install CD itself. Downloading packages at install time reduces the size of the install CD to approximately 5 to 20MB depending on architecture, as well as providing only the packages needed for installation. The download time savings achieved by using a Minimal CD can be significant, as only current packages are downloaded, so there is no need to upgrade packages immediately after installation. The Minimal CD uses a text-based installer like the Alternate CD, making the CD image as compact as possible.\nBasically you get whatever is needed to get you to command line and you will need to install anything else yourself: so next you install a window manager if you want.\nYou can use tasksel on the command line to install servers (where you end up with a server install)\n\n\n*\n\n*Server installation:\n\n\nThe Server Edition provides a common base for all sorts of server applications. It is a minimalist design providing a platform for the desired services, such as file/print services, networking, DNS, web hosting, email hosting, wiki server, version control server. \nBasically you get to choose at installation what server applications you want. \nRegarding the kernel these should be the basic differences between a server and other installs: \n\n\n*\n\n*Preemption is turned off in the Server Edition.\n\n*The timer interrupt is 100 Hz in the Server Edition and 250 Hz in the Desktop Edition.\n\n*The Server Edition is optimized for i686 processors while the Desktop Edition is optimized for both the i586 and i686.\n\n*Virtualization is better supported in the Server Edition through the enabling of IPC namespaces, and the Xen hypervisor.\n\n*Multiple routing tables for the IPv6 protocol are also supported in the Server Edition.\n\n*For 32-bit systems the Server Edition is configured to use PAE which allows addressing up to 64GB of memory while the Desktop Edition is configured for 4GB.\n\n\nNote: Since 12.10 the Deadline I/O scheduler is the default for both Desktop and Server Editions (previously CFQ was the default for the Desktop Edition).\nA minimal install where you install a desktop afterwards will get you an Ubuntu Desktop Edition.\nA minimal install where you install servers afterwards will get you an Ubuntu Server Edition but you will need to optimize the kernel yourself.\nYou would be better off starting with the Desktop or Server Edition instead of a minimal install if you intend to end up with a normal version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: This page says, \"While the minimal iso image is handy, it isn't useful for installing on UEFI-based systems that you want to run in UEFI mode. The mini iso lacks the proper files for booting the computer in UEFI mode. Thus, the computer will boot in BIOS compatibility mode, and the installation will be in BIOS mode.\" It then suggests a server install as an alternative.\n\nA: Ubuntu server gives you the choice (at install time) to install packages like apache2 (or LAMP), or openssh-server.\nOn Minimal, you are on your own and you have to install everything you need manually (with the aid of apt-get or aptitude.\n\nA: Besides using different kernels, I don't believe there is. If your going to install a Desktop stick with minimal.\n", "Q: Problems with multi-monitor with Unity I've installed Ubuntu 11.04 recently, and almost everythings works fine.

I've already installed Ubuntu Server 11.04 about 3 times.  I followed the software raid instructions here to the best of my abilities, even though the screens are different. I did not use a RAID 1 for my boot partition on each drive...is that a must?\nAnyway, I've had errors in past installations, but I was able to get through the entire install with 3 drives, a small bootable partition on each (sda/b/c1?), a swap partition on each (sda/b/c3), and then a large partition mounted to / for my RAID 5 (sda/b/c2).  The final install step looks like everything works correctly because Ubuntu says it is installing GRUB to /dev/sda1 through /dev/sdc1, but then when I try to boot for the first time, it immediately says \"error: no such disk  GRUB recovery>\".\nI was able to login using LiveCD and try to get Grub loaded, but I haven't had any luck there as well.  If I apt-get grub and run it and issue find /boot/grub/stage1, it says nothing is found.  What am I doing wrong, how do I get to a working Raid5?\n\nA: I did not use a RAID 1 for my boot partition on each drive...is that a must?\nIn the instructions immediately under the installation section's first image, there is a warning in bold that states:\nWarning: the /boot filesystem cannot use any softRAID level other than 1\nI assume this is where things may be going wrong.\nThis is one reason why I stick to hardware RAID controllers as opposed to software - less chance of user errors, less chance of corruption, etc. :)\n\nA: Software RAID is great once you get it going.  It also means you can move your disks to another server which does not have the same hardware RAID card in it.\nWhy don't you set up your disks as follows.\nEach disk gets 3 partitions, a small 10GB \"scratch\" partition that never gets used, a 30 GB Partition for Ubuntu RAID1, and for the 3rd partition use about 99% of the rest of the disk,leaving a small amount of free space. The 3rd partition will be used to set up RAID5 once you've installed Ubuntu.\nMake ALL your disks have the same partition setup (use sfdisk to copy the partition layout by booting into Ubuntu Rescue Remix CD or other live CD image- you may want to disable RAID when you are doing this copy otherwise the live CD finds the RAID and makes it active- it can be a pain to unmount and then disable the mdX RAID array).\nHere is the logic to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st \"scratch\" partition is there in case you are doing recovery and need a temporary FS for recovery (e.f. ddrescue recovery log). Or you can install a new OS onto it if you want.\n\n*2nd partition is RAID 1 for Ubuntu. Set up /=2GB, /usr=6GB, /var=3GB, /home=3GB, /tmp=10GB (/tmp can be smaller but 10GB allows 1 full 8GB DVD image + some spare)\n\n*The various filesystems act as \"firewalls\" in case something fills up a FS, it is easier to recover and may not crash the system.\n\n*You can install LVM onto this RAID partition as well for added flexibility. Grub2 will boot from LVM on RAID1.  I am using this. With LVM you set up LVs (logical volumes) for each filesystem.\n\n*No need for a separate /boot filesystem.  This just complicates matters!\n\n*LVM provides flexibility as you can extend a filesystem easily or even migrate it to a new drive while the system keeps running.\n\n*Once Ubuntu is installed on RAID1 set up RAID 5 on the other disks.\n\n*You can boot into Ubuntu Rescue Remix CD and use \"sfdisk\" to nicely copy disk partitions from one to another.

The \"-0\" argument to xargs tells it to expect this sort of input, so filenames with spaces get piped to the ls command correctly.\nThe xargs construction is in some ways better than find etc -exec ls {} + because all the filenames get sent to ls at once, so if you want to sort them all by timestamp (using ls), something like this works:\nfind . -iname *pdf -print0 | xargs -0 ls -ltr\n\nOn a NetBSD system, \"-printx\" is also an option (this seems a useful argument to me, but whatever, we have xargs -0 and it's okay):\nfind . -name *foo* -printx | xargs ls -lah` # not for Ubuntu\n\n\nA: You can use -exec with find command.\nfind . -name '*foo*' -exec ls -lah {} \\;\n\n\nA: find . -name *foo* | xargs -r ls -lah\n\nThat should work.\n", "Q: How to get Wireless working with Ubuntu 11 Server?

Perhaps with LVM I can have 1 Logical Volume span multiple disks?\nAlso the default LVM Setup in Ubuntu is abit confusing ... \n\nWhats the 255MB ext2 parition for? Shouldn't ext4 be better? Looks awefully similar to those OEM partitions on Windows ...\n\nWhy is there 4MB wasted ... How do I determine how much space I should allocate to swap. I read previously for Windows that if I have enough RAM, I should have low/no swap space to force OS to use faster RAM? True?\nWhy does Ubuntu split the same HDD into 2 different Views?\n\nWhy do I get such a different picture in GParted? No swap here? Then now, if I want to add a partition, I should shrink sda5 then add one? Since its the OS partition I cant do that when booted I guess?\n\nA: I don't know why the default LVM setup was chosen, but I can offer some background on how LVM works.\nWithout LVM, you divide a disk in partitions, and each partition contains a filesystem (/, /home, etc.) or something else such as swap space.\nLVM introduces a layer of insulation between the disk structures and the content-bearing structures. I'll refer you to the Wikipedia article for a more in-depth presentation, but in a nutshell, each disk partition is an LVM physical volume, while each filesystem or swap area is an LVM logical volume. There's no relationship between the extent of logical and physical volumes: the space in a physical volume can be divided between several logical volumes, and a logical volume can be stored across multiple physical volumes.\nThis explains why you're seeing two views. At the disk partitioning level, you have a disk with two partitions, one of which happens to be an LVM physical volume. At the content level, you have several filesystems, some of which happen to be on LVM logical volumes.\nParted isn't showing the LVM logical volumes. Either this version of Parted doesn't support LVM (hmm, I thought it did), or you need to tell it to switch to a different view, or you have already created partitions but not logical volumes yet.\nI don't know where you're seeing 4MB wasted. I see 17MB unallocated, and I don't know why. Up to 4MB unused could happen with LVM: the size of each logical volume is a multiple of 4MB.\nI don't know for sure what the 255MB ext2 partition is for, but I guess it's meant to be /boot. It used to be that Grub, the default Ubuntu bootloader, couldn't boot from LVM. But Grub 2, the default bootloader for new installation since Ubuntu 9.10, supports an all-LVM installation, so you probably don't need that boot partition. (There are rare cases where an ext2 boot partition is still useful, for example if you're dual-booting with another operating system that doesn't support loading a kernel from LVM or ext4.)\n\nI think I've addressed everything except the amount of swap. (Aside: you shouldn't ask unrelated questions in one question. The amount of swap has nothing to do with your interrogations about LVM. But the topic has already been done to death, so don't ask it separately, just search the site.) Since disk space is cheap, don't hesitate to have ample swap. The machine I'm posting this from has 4GB of RAM and 16GB of swap. Having low or not swap space will absolutely not “force the OS to use faster RAM”, this is completely wrong and I advise treating any source that says this with deep suspicion. (As far as I know this applies to Windows as well.) The OS will use RAM whenever it can. Swap is only used as a last resort, when there isn't enough RAM. Note that on a normal system, you should expect to see some swap in use. That's because RAM isn't just for storing the memory of running processes, it's also for caching disk contents. In fact, it's quite common to have about half the RAM used by the disk cache, and to have some process memory swapped out. If your system didn't do this, it would be running slower, because it would waste more time reloading the same files from disk again and again.\n\nA: While I think the core of your answer is answered above, I would like to also point out that managing LVM is easiest via the graphical interface of Ubuntu.  \nHowever if you're building a server that will be command-line (particularly a headless one), you may find LVM a bit painful to manage - especially if you're new to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Files are read-only after copying over samba I used to copy files from one system to another system via samba.

What is the correct/best way of dual booting another Linux distribution (say, Fedora 14) along with Ubuntu 11.04? Is sharing the /home partition with both distros is a good idea? What are the pitfalls I have to be aware of?\n\nA: Using the same home can cause problems, especially with the configuration files that are in your home directory. All of your personal settings and configurations for numerous applications are contained in your home folder. In addition to the UID (user ID) issue, it is possible that Fedora and Ubuntu use different versions of some applications, which may have conflicting/incompatible config file format(s) and/or locations within your HOME. \nBut I have a better idea for you: make both Fedora and Ubuntu their own home on a minimum partition and use a shared data partition where you store your own files. When you are done installing both systems remove on both system ~/Desktop and make a symbolic link to a directory on the data partition with ln -s /datapartition/Desktop ~/Desktop. You can do that with all directories and have 1 desktop, 1 downloads, 1 pictures folder all with the same files.\nThis not only prevents you overwriting files in your home directory that are different for another OS but when you add a 3rd,4th, 5th OS or when you need to reinstall you can have all the important files back by recreating the symlinks.\nedit: here is an example of what can go wrong: Why are my two ubuntu installs on separate partitions sharing the same apt-get data?\nThis user has 2 Ubuntu's installed: one with classic and one with Unity both using the same /home/.\n~/.config/software-center\n~/.cache/software-center\nare being used by both systems since these are in /home/ so updates and software installed affect both installations.\n\nA: Just install one distro after the other. However, I would strongly recommend against using the same /home location for both as application settings of the two distros would overwrite one another. You can still use the same /home/Documents/ or /home/Pictures etc for both though - this will make sharing files super-easy. \nUbuntu Tweak lets you easily switch the default folder locations:\n\nA: I use Ubuntu as my base distro and then install any others I use as virtual machines using Virtualbox OSE (available in Synaptic and the Software Centre). It just feels cleaner doing it this way instead of dual-booting. You also have the confidence to add/delete operating systems at will without the fear of messing up your whole box.\nSharing /home folders between systems is a bad idea due to the amount of hidden config files. It's much better to have a centralised file server for your documents. You can set one up cheaply with an external HDD.\n", "Q: Mouse/gesture control with kinect?

As a matter of fact I reinstalled it too, but it did not solve the problem.\n\nA: Looks like you had an update on virtualbox and because of that, its kernel module wasn't recompiled (that's why it wants you to install the dkms package). \nI don't know if you're running the open source version of virtualbox, but usually running this command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\nsolves the problems.\n\nA: Because of useful and regular updates it is recommended to install and run Virtual Box from the repository maintained by Oracle. For avoiding to manually update the kernel driver on every update DKMS  is useful.\nSee also this answer for details on the installation of Virtual Box.\n\nA: I had precisely the same error. Running virtualbox from the command-line gave the following error:\nWARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.\n     Please install the virtualbox-ose-dkms package and the appropriate\n     headers, most likely linux-headers-generic.\n\n     You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.\n\nConsequently, I did the following and it solved the bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the latest open-source version of VirtualBox as explained here.

I would like to know if there is anyone that successfully installed  a production Launchpad instance, one that it actively used - other than the launchpad.net one.\nRelated to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5420774/does-anyone-have-experience-with-a-private-launchpad-instance\n\nA: I know of one instance of Launchpad other than launchpad.net. It lives at: https://quickbuild.pearsoncomputing.net/. I believe it was setup mostly to take advantage of the build system in Launchpad.\nThere have been a few attempts to get LP running and people often ask questions on IRC about how to run a Launchpad themselves.  However, as far as I know, the URL for QuickBuild above is the only person to have some success at this.\n\nA: According to the FAQ:\n\n\"Launchpad's production configuration information and some configuration-specific admin scripts are not part of the Launchpad code base...\"\n\n...so you would need to create these files yourself or remove the functionality that depends on these scripts. Based on the contents of that paragraph, I get the impression that these files are not trivial and contribute some pretty major functionality to Launchpad.\nAnd it doesn't end there. Since Launchpad is an extremely active project, updates to the codebase are very frequent and could break your private instance very easily. The FAQ states:\n\n\"Essentially, there's a risk of a private instance becoming an unintentional fork, where its code cannot be safely updated due to the data in the local instance being incompatible with the latest database schema or code assumptions.\"\n\nSo you would have to stay up to date on all of the latest patches and changes and also make sure that they integrate with your instance without any problems.\nAccording to the FAQ, the purpose of releasing the source code for Launchpad was not so that others could run \"Launchpad-clones,\" but so that anyone can help contribute patches / bugfixes for the original instance of Launchpad.\n\nAll of this is to explain why there are no other instances of Launchpad anywhere. It's simply too much work and for very little gain.\n", "Q: Printers compatible with Ubuntu also compatible with Crunchbang?

The other advantage is that all your browser, mail client messages and accounts, chat settings, add-ons, and passwords are all in one directory.

Why is it that when I provide a username during the installation process for Ubuntu, that a new group is created with that name too?\nIs there a reason we're not just plain Administrators?\n\n\nA: Being an administrator just opens up a bunch of other options to you as a user (they are mostly unimportant), but it won't really change anything.\nBy default, the first user (the one you create from the installer) is an administrator (essentially) with some options disabled for safety. The reason everyone gets a separate group is simply because it makes it easier to manage permissions (on a Unix) system in this way.\n\nA: This is necessary because of Linux file system rights. Linux (and other Unix variants) have a right setting for 3 types of users: a owner, a owning group and \"others\" (i.e. someone who's not the owner and not in the owning group). All files (on linux filesystems) are obliged to have a owner and owning group.\nSince usually files that are created by a user are meant for that user only the owner is set to the user and the owning group is set to a special group the user belongs to: the group with the user its name. Thats why such a group is created whenever a new user is created.\n\nA: There is you, root (admin), and everyone else. You're automatically added to sudoers and can perform as root(admin) via sudo because of your group status. Root and Administrator are pretty synonymous. \nUbuntu wants to make it easy for users to get up and running without having to install and configure all that stuff.\nEDIT: Read RootSudo\n", "Q: Is there a flavour of libreoffice that is better looking I have set up ubuntu at my office and one thing I hear no end is how ugly libreoffice is.

It is based on openoffice - the suite libreoffice is based on as well.

This would be a great feature.\n\nA: You could do a Paper Cut or a Feature request for Ubuntu Software Center\nIt's a good idea.\n", "Q: How does updating running application binaries during an upgrade work? I just upgraded my ubuntu lucid to natty , during the upgrade it replaced most of the \nrunning applications with a newer version. \n\nHow does this work? (Won't the applications crash?)\n  What will happen to the application if a lib file got upgraded and a running application which is looking for a older lib tries to load it?\n\n\nA: Unlike Windows, you can delete or replace an open file; to give a simplified explanation, new requests for the files open the new file, existing handles use the file that existed when they were created. In other words, in Linux you can have files/file versions that still exist, although there's no longer a pointer to them in the directory structure; those cease existing there is no pointer to them at all (closed and all).\nUsually a running app loads the needed libraries up front, so the problem you describe would only happen in very specific timing situations while the package is being installed: the running apps are still using the old version of the library, newly started apps use the new one.\nThis is used not only in distro upgrades, but happens on every package upgrade (the dist-upgrade just adds a couple more automagic steps to that process).\n\nA: Linux (and other UNIXes) draws a distinction between the name of a file (the link), the file itself (often identified with the inode), and open handles to the file. When you go to delete a file, you call the unlink() call - this erases the link to the file (you could also use rename() to overwrite it with a different inode). However, if open handles to the file (or other links - files can have multiple hardlinks) remain, the inode remains, and so does the file content, until all links and handles go away.\nSo running programs using the library or whatever keep a handle to the old version (often implicitly through a memory mapping), so it stays on disk. It just doesn't have a filename anymore, and will be cleaned up when all programs using it shut down (or on the next reboot, during the filesystem check or journal replay).\nFurther, note that programs expecting the 'old library' will do just fine with newer versions of the library. Linux libraries are assigned a filename ('soname') that reflects the version of the ABI (Application Binary Interface) offered by the library. For example, the C library on my system is libc.so.6. Any program compiled against an older version of libc, but still a version of libc implementing the version 6 ABI, will work fine with it. Really old programs will look for a libc.so.5 or libc.so.4 or something instead; in this case, you'd need to keep the old version around as well - but since the filename is different, this isn't a problem.\n\nA: Many Linux processes continue to work after the packages they come from have been upgraded - but some don't. In my experience, KDE never works properly if you upgrade it while it's running. You are likely to experience crashes and/or failures to log out.\n", "Q: Broadcom BCM4321 wireless doesn't work on battery \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to Install Broadcom / STA Wireless card (BCM43XX) \n\nUpgraded Ubuntu to 11.04, now wireless card does not work when I unplug the laptop\nlspci -vvnn | grep 14e4\n10:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5787M Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express [14e4:1693] (rev 02)\n30:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4321 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4328] (rev 03)\n\n\nA: You could try finding out what driver your wireless card uses by running\nlsmod | egrep \"b43|wl|brcm80211\"\n\nand then running\nsudo rmmod yourdriver\nsudo modprobe yourdriver\n\nSince your wireless card is the BCM4321, you're likely running the wl driver (a.k.a.

I have a simple usability problem that I would love to fix.\nI work quite a bit with gedit as my LaTeX editor (with the excellent LaTeX plugin). I constantly need to work with several files. So, a very common situation for me is to be working on some file (hence gedit is running) when the need to edit another file arises.

How do I mount Shares from an Iomega ix4-200d?\nPlug-and-play from Windows with the included installation CD, but not a word about Linux.\nIt looks like there are several ways to do it; I have put my current solution below.\n\nA: Not knowing anything about such endeavors, this took me about 4 hours to figure out.  It turns out the procedure is very simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your ix4 from the web\nbrowser (you should see the IP\naddress on the drive screen). \n\n*Click the \"Network\" icon then the\n\"Protocol\" icon.\n\n*See the little penguin next to \"NFS\"?  That's your\nLinux documentation (nice of them).\n\n*Turn NFS on.  Yes, it was off by\ndefault.  Again, that was nice of\nthem. \n\n*sudo mount -t nfs\n192.168.1.113:/nfs/SHARENAME /mnt/yourdir\n\n*SHARENAME above is just the name of your Share on the ix4 without embellishment.  Keep the /nfs.  Obviously, change the IP address to whatever your's is.\n\n*/mnt/yourdir is a directory you've created with mkdir.  Actually, it can be anywhere.  /mnt is the canonical place.\n\n*If your Ubuntu installation was like mine, the above command will fail because you do not have a file called mount.nfs in your /sbin directory.  Quite an oversight on your part.  Install it with apt-get install nfs-common.\n\n\nOnce you get it working you can put a similar line in /etc/fstab, so your Shares are automatically mounted.  Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the Sourceforge nfs resource explain how to do it.\nKudos to Eric Crossley's Blog which has the idea of mounting as NFS and the basic mount command.  He has a few more useful ix4 setups there as well.\n\nA: I just installed it, thanks for your help but I needed a few different settings.\nsudo mount //192.168.1.89/public ~/Iomega -o uid=1000, gid=1000,rw,username='admin',password=#########\n\nI just want to point out the differences (and might be stating the obvious? but I am new to Linux):\n\n*\n\n*addressing the network works only with //a.b.c.d. and very mean,\n\n*the (German) settings on the ix2 tells you to mount to //a.b.c.d/nfs/.... and this should be /public.\n\n\nA: I've got access with a little distinct syntax:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o username=administrador,password=XXXXXX //10.20.12.21/NASIII /home/rsouza/NAS\n\nDon't forget to enable NFS on the NAS (Network-Protocols)\n\nA: I couldn't abide the fact that on Windows I could access the shares with out  credentials but on my Linuxes it kept asking for password and/or giving 'Access denied'.\nThis finally worked for me.\nIn the Iomega Control Panel (web GUI), go to Network>Protocols.\nEnable NFS.\nThen go to Storage>Shares.\nYou should see the share folders all listed (Documents, Pictures, etc).\nExpand each one and you should see options like 'Information', 'NFS', etc.\nExpand 'NFS' and it will reveal the NFS share name.\nIn my case the shares had these names:\nDocuments = /nfs/Documents\nMovies = /nfs/Movies\ni.e.\n{ShareName} = /nfs/{ShareName}\n\netc\nSo, on my Ununtu server i first installed the NFS (and CIFS for good measure):\napt install nfs-utils\napt install cifs-utils\n\nThen I wrote this script to handle the mounting:\nfor D in Documents Pictures Backups Music Movies\ndo\n   banner $D\n   umount /mnt/ts1/$D\n   mkdir /mnt/ts1/$D\n   mount.nfs 10.0.0.101:/nfs/$D /mnt/ts1/$D\ndone\n\nNo need to provide username and password - access just as you would via Windows Explorer.\n", "Q: Broke Evince / Missing libevdocument library After a botched Gnome 3 install I managed to revert back to classic and everything seems to be working fine. Everything, that is, aside from Evince. I was trying to open a PDF file and Evince just refused to open; I clicked on it, it would load, then stop loading and would no longer appear in the system monitor. I then tried opening it from the terminal, and this error came up:\n\nevince: error while loading shared\n  libraries: libevdocument.so.3: cannot\n  open shared object file: No such file\n  or directory\n\nSo I went to synaptic and searched for \"libevdocument\" and found libevdocument3 installed (version 3.0.0-0ubuntu1~build1) which I attempted to mark for reinstallation, but that option was greyed out, so I tried to completely remove but then it warned gnome-core, libevview3, evince and ubuntu-desktop would be removed. And that sounded bad so I didn't do that. The same happened for uninstall. So now I'm stuck unable to view PDF files. I'm about to install Adobe Reader, but I'd really rather stick with Evince. Any suggestions?\n\nA: can you try\nsudo aptitude reinstall libevdocument\n\nDoes that install the gnome2 version of libevdocument?\n\nA: gnome-core and ubuntu-desktop are meta-packages that don't contain files themselves, but depend on other packages.  So uninstalling them won't cause any issues, especially since you can reinstall them when you reinstall libevdocument3.  \nOr you could do it the other way and uninstall the packages you mentioned and then reinstall ubuntu-desktop and gnome-core and due to their dependence on evince, it and libevdocument3 would be reinstalled.\n", "Q: Boot partition changes every time it's mounted. How to stop this? I'm setting up a Linux system with full disk encryption.

Basically some screenshots with further information on bootloader can be found here. If you have some filesystem errors you may check your filesystem from live-usb or gparted/Disk-Utility from live-usb.\nP.S. If you don't mind resetting the configurations, I think using new install is less tedious than recovering. Having said that if you have different home partition, your old settings can be used as well after you install the application for the settings that is. You should recover/backup your important data as @Philippe recommends.\n\nA: First thing to do is make a backup of your files (if you don't have that already!).\nProbably the best is to boot from a LiveCD\nBut if I understand you correctly, the system won't access them. To solve that you could try to access them as root.\n sudo cp /mountpoint/oldfiles /media/usb_or_whatever\n\nEventually chroot into your old drive is that would not work directly.\nThen I would recommend a complete re-install.

By default it is locked in Ubuntu but you can enable the root account.\nThis is normally not a good idea however and you should consider very carefully before enabling the root login.\nThere are several good reasons not to login as root but use sudo instead including\n\n\n*\n\n*Users don't have to remember an extra password (i.e. the root password), which they are likely to forget (or write down so anyone can crack into their account easily).\n\n*It avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by default (e.g. the tendency by users to login as an \"Administrator\" user in Microsoft Windows systems), you will be prompted for a password before major changes can happen, which should make you think about the consequences of what you are doing.\n\n*sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If you mess up, you can always go back and see what commands were run. It is also nice for auditing.\n\n*Every cracker trying to brute-force their way into your box will know it has an account named Root and will try that first. What they don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the Root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first place.\n\n*Allows easy transfer for admin rights, in a short term or long term period, by adding and removing users from groups, while not compromising the Root account.\nsudo can be setup with a much more fine-grained security policy.\nThis is discussed in more detail in the RootSudo Comunity Documentation\nIf you have a number of commands which would normally require sudo you can type sudo -i before the first command then exit after the last to avoid repeatedly typing sudo.  To run a GUI application with root priviledges press ALT+F2 and enter gksu or gksudo followed by the name of your program (unless you are using the KDE desktop in which case the command is kdesu.\nFor example gksu nautilus runs the file manager with root privileges.\nAs you can see it is almost never necessary to enable the root login.\nThat said to enable the root login all that is required is to set a root password\nsudo passwd root\n\nand set a password.  You will then be able to login as root but for all the reasons I have given above and more I would not recommend you do it. \n", "Q: Black screen when playing a movie in VLC player, just the sound is enabled When I move the VLC player window, I can see the video but when I stop moving it, then it gets back to black.\nThis happens not only in VLC but with my webcam too, when I use camorama webcam.\n\nA: go to Tools → Preferences → Video and set the output to X11 video output and save it\nnow close and open VLC, and open your video\nEdit:\nIf it still doesn't work try setting the output to OpenGL video output as suggested by @Asaf\n\nA: Switching off  dpms is the Problem.

Is it possible to apply any themes to improve the appearance of Evolution?\nIf so, how? I think the progress of Unity makes Evolution look a bit dull, and would like to spark it up.\n\nA: Evolution uses the same theme as your other desktop applications but it will probably look as dull as it is now. So you are out of luck there.\nTo make this worthy answering I can advise on some cool themes made for Ubuntu 11.04 that also adjust evolution.

I'm running 10.04 which uses libfreetype6 version 2.3 and which is not able to do proper hinting of certain fonts. However, if I understand correctly, later versions are capable of hinting fonts properly. So why does Natty still have slight-hinting by default?\n\nA: It's a matter of taste. Full hinting can be very aggressive, as it changes the original shapes of the glyphs to fit the grid. Some people like this XP-like crisp look, but others prefer slightly fuzzier Mac-like style. There has to be some default in Ubuntu, and slight hinting sounds like a good compromise.\n\nA: Because the patent for font hinting expired just recently and the old version of libfreetype simply isn't compiled with font hinting.\nPlus because Ubuntu doesn't provide major software upgrades within one version, you can expect font hinting only in the upcoming Ubuntu releases (talking about the official packages of course).\n", "Q: Unity side bar sticking?

What's the simplest and quickest way to display the dimensions of a folder containing images? There doesn't appear to be an option to do this in Nautilus. There's only so many right-click file > Properties > Image operations I can perform, before losing the will to live.\n\nA: There is a package called nautilus-columns. I currently find it only in a PPA, which is documented here. With this little script its easy to add columns for various meta data for PDF, images, sound files etc. To sum all things up:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-columns\nnautilus -q\n\nFinally go to Edit > Preferences > List Columns and enable all you need. Please note, its only working for the List-View.\nCurrent versions of nautilus-columns can also be found here.\n\nA: Use a script! For things not in Nautilus by default you can add scripts yourself.\nMore information on ubuntuforums. The topic starts out adding music information but from reply #32 it also involves images. Scripts (use at own risk) and instructions in the link.\nLook at the screenshot for how this will look (it's for an older Ubuntu but this still works): \n\n\nA: Run this from a terminal (works for PNG and GIF images):\nfile *.{png,gif}\n\nThat works because the file command  shows the dimensions for PNG and GIF images, as well as some other information. Your shell expands *.{png,gif} to a list of filenames, and the file command accepts multiple filename arguments. It looks like this:\nbtvs-cordelia-probable-syntax-error.png: PNG image data, 1920 x 1080, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\ncross.png:                               PNG image data, 1039 x 611, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\n\nNotice that the columns are lined up, so extra space is used if some names are much longer than others. If you don't want that, use the -N option:\nfile -N *.{png,gif}\n\nThat gives you lines like this, which no longer take up extra space, but are no longer aligned:\nbtvs-cordelia-probable-syntax-error.png: PNG image data, 1920 x 1080, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\ncross.png: PNG image data, 1039 x 611, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced\n\nIn the rare case where you have many thousands of image files, their names might exceed the maximum combined argument length, and the shell would give you an error message. In that case, you could use a loop like this:\nfor f in *.{png,gif}; do file \"$f\"; done\n\nThat produces the same results as file -N because, since file only knows about one file per run, so it doesn't know how long the other filenames are and it cannot align the columns.\nFor other image types, see ypnos's answer to Fast way to get image dimensions (not filesize).\n", "Q: How to show unread IMAP mail count in Byobu Byobu supports `mail notification':\nmail - system mail for the current user; the letter '[M]' is displayed\nin the lower bar toward the left in black text on a grey background\n\nHow could system mail be set to regard IMAP accounts?\n\nA: You need to configure your system mail client included in the mailutils package to receive mails from you online account (e.g. gmail).

As far as I know you can only select a folder from several options to mount in a certain partition.\nThanks.\n\nA: That is not possible. You can add both directories to the / partition or you can put /var and /tmp each on a seperate partition. \nAlternative/workaround:\nYou can use a symlink and have /tmp store its files on a new directory like /var/temp/. That would require the following commands:\nsudo mkdir /var/temp/\nsudo rm -rf /tmp/\nsudo ln -s /var/temp/ /tmp/\nThis also requires you to recreate the permissions to /tmp/.\nsudo chmod 777 /tmp\nsudo chmod +t /tmp/\nsudo chown root:root /tmp/\nUntested.

When I need to edit a file (e.g. the httpd.conf file or the php.ini file) I start a terminal and open it with:\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nMost of the times, in order to be able to edit the files that I need without having to sudo all the time, I do a:\nsudo bash\n\nand stop worrying about sudo. However, in some cases, I prefer to edit files with gEdit or some other text editors. Most of the times though, the user that I'm logged in as, does not have the necessary permissions to edit the specific file. So my question is the following:\nBesides opening gedit through Terminal with sudo, is there any easier way to edit a text file as Super User so that I don't get access denied errors? The same question applies to running applications as Super User (e.g. WireShark requires Super User permissions and I have to launch it from the terminal every time with sudo). \nMaybe I'm missing something obvious here, but please enlighten me.\n\nA: You don't need to drop into root everytime you want to run a few applications. You can add new menu items to your system which will launch applications as the root user (via sudo and gksudo) Adding new menu items is outlined in How can I add and change items in my Applications Menu? Just look up the software's command in alacarte, copy it for the new entry and prior to it's command add gksudo IE: gksudo gedit\nTypically I make a new folder called \"System Tools\" and place those under there.\nOnce you create the entry in alacarte you can then Right Click the file, Open With another Application, and choose the new entry you've create in alacarte as the software to open with. \n", "Q: Excel Cell Comments Are White When Opened in Calc?

I recently reinstalled Ubuntu 11.04 Natty after a massive hard drive failure.\nNow, for some reason, compiz and Xorg decide it's a fun idea to start eating up my RAM and CPU - GB by GB.

Note, that I had only switched to ALT + F1, I had not logged in yet.\n\nThe messages were reporting that my usb tv-tuner card was not properly initialised. These messages kept scrolling on and on as if the system was stuck in an infinite loop trying continuously to initialise the tv card (and of course failing every time).\nAs expected, as soon as I disconnected the usb tv-card, the messages stopped, but to my amazement Xorg stopped inflating too. Just to make sure, I reconnected the usb tv tuner and the error messages came up, and again Xorg started gorging memory like an SUV filling up at a gas station.\n\nBut, right before the villagers (a.k.a ubuntu users) are about to smash their dysfunctional usb equipment and stone the dysfunctional usb equipment vendor, there is a sudden turn in the scenario. It is NOT actually the usb tv-card that caused all this trouble. The tv-card was only the symptom and not the source of the problem. The plot thickens...\n\nHaving used this tv-card before without an incident, I took a better look at the error message complaining about the tv-card. There was another line complaining about the usb port of the usb-hub, where I plugged in my tv-card. Hmmm, I had just bought this hub. So then I tried plugging the tv-card in a usb port directly on the motherboard. And everything worked fine! No error messages, and no Xorg bloating.\nSo at the end the actual problem was this:\n\nXorg was consuming memory because of initialisation errors of a usb device (and in my book this is a serious bug). Since a lot of people report problems with Xorg in ubuntu 12.04, I suggest that you also take a look at your usb devices. My tv-card could not be initialised when plugged in my new usb-hub, and that caused the problem. Putting it in a separate usb port on the motherboard fixed the problem.\n\nP.S. The usb-hub is most likely either linux-incompatible, or should be replaced by one that has its own power adapter instead of being powered by the computer's usb bus (see USB hub not working properly Ubuntu 12.04). My web-cam also does not work when I plug it in the hub. It does work if plugged in a usb port on the motherboard. However note that, when I plug it in the usb-hub, dmesg reports that the web cam is properly recognised and initialised (although cheese gives me just a black image), and since there are no error messages, Xorg does not fill up the computer's memory.\n\nP.P.S. I invite the distraught villagers to gather outside one-eyed Tim's barn, to throw their dysfunctional usb-hubs in a big festive bonfire. When the fire has built up, we will throw in the usb-hub vendor too. Free beer for everyone! Mua ha ha ha ha (deep voice laughter)\n:-)\n\nA: I had a similar issue with Kubunutu 11.10. I resolved the issue by disabling fancy effects. I also added a ppa for xorg updates (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates) but that for me didn't make a difference.\nMy issue is probably due to the Matrox driver not being supported by 11.10, well kernel version 3.\n\nA: I have the same problem but when i satt system monitor to show all proses it showed up that xorg was using half of the cpu. I have been irritated by this bug.\nBut in comment 8 he made it stoop with:\nsudo rmmod ums_realtek\n\nthis worked for me to and it made xorg use only around 5-10% cpu though it didnt help on mystic cpu usage.\n\nA: There is a memory leak in your xorg, it's hard to tell exactly what the issue is without you posting your xorg logs from /var/log/ and your user xorg errors in your home folder (use show hidden files to find it).\nThe best suggestion I can offer you is to reinstall a version of Ubuntu that works. Try first with a USB stick or CD rom and leave it running for a while. Try to find the sweet spot and stick with that.\n\nA: I had Xorg going up to 60% while watching YouTube, made my desktop very hot. What happened, I had enabled desktop \"compositing\" (for drop shadows etc.) All I had to do was run top, then found \"xcompmgr\" was running, then I sent the kill signal and now Xorg is down to 3% while watching YouTube. \nMaybe some compositing apps are more efficient than others, or the one I have is badly configured. \nPS: I'm using Debian 9 but I think some of my configuration is outdated--this machine was originally running Crunchbang and that's how the compositing was setup. \n\nA: I have found a temporary solution to this problem. I checked the system monitor for which program was taking too much CPU other than the Xorg. For me it was prettier. I killed the program by choosing end task. Immediately the CPU usage of Xorg decreased to normal.\nKilling any other programs by accident is not a problem unless you have an update or upgrade command in background. Just keep killing the programs using high CPU till you find your guy. If you kill some important program by accident, just reboot Ubuntu and everything is back to normal again.\n\nA: Try a different DE.\nI have both xfce and lxqt installed. I used to use xfce a lot, until I realized with current version of xfce, I have to logout and login much more frequently than in lxqt to avoid OOM error in which case XOrg consumes way more memory than it should.\n", "Q: Program to remove image from mp3 files Am looking for a program in Ubuntu that can remove the logo/image of an mp3 file. For example when i open Banshee (Or any other player that can show the image of a mp3 file) it shows this guy from Ecuador, Peru or some country that freaks people out. I want to remove his image from all mp3 files i have.\nJust to add, this is not one of those hidden files that comes with the mp3 files folder. This is an embedded image INSIDE the mp3. Just to clarify that part and i want to strip clean the image.\nWould be great a terminal command (Since for me is better) but a gui one will work as well.\n\nA: Command line: Eyed3 (Install eyed3)\nEyeD3 is a Python program and module that provides the ability \nto read and write ID3 tags (v1.x and v2.3/v2.4). It also decodes MP3 \nheaders (bit rate, sample frequency, play time, etc.).\nIt has a command line option --remove-images or you can use --add image=\"\".\nAnd it is inside USC.\nIf you want a GUI option: Easytag (Install easytagaac)\n\nA: You can use ffmpeg command line tool for this:\nffmpeg -y -i audio_file_with_artwork.mp3 -vn -c copy audio_without_artwork.mp3\n\nExplanation of options:\n-y        Overwrite output files without asking\n-i        [input] Defines input file\n-vn       Blocks all video streams (also embedded images) from being selected\n-c copy   Do not re-encode the stream\n\nYou can learn more about the tool and options using man ffmpeg.\n\nA: I have opened the file with audacity and exported it. It worked.\nBut to keep the audio quality you show save it in raw format. To do that click on Export->Export as Audio. Then the quality of the output file won't change, but it will increase the file a lot.\nAn other solution, which is not increasing the file, but keeps the quality is from the most voted answer here. My answer just adds the commands which are missing in the other answer. Also my answer improves the other answer because the command is with remove-all-images in newer versions of the eyed3 program. First go inside the folder where your mp3 files are and run:\nsudo apt-get install -y eyed3\neyeD3 --remove-all-images ./*.mp3\n\nThis will remove the images from the .mp3 and won't change the quality.\nIt can work for many files with one line, without adding more lines to the command above or writing scripts about it.\n", "Q: How to run just one application over ethernet while others on wifi I normally connect my laptop via wifi. However, I would like to use synergy to share my workplace desktop machine with my laptop. But the problem is that my desktop machine doesn't have wireless support. So, I have no other options except using ethernet to connect them.   \nMy first question is - Is it possible to use ethernet for synergy and keep using wifi for all other application. If the answer is yes, can somebody please guide me how to achieve this.  \nThanks,\n\nA: This method will create a wired network segment with only two hosts. Synergy will talk over the wire, while all the computers' other network traffic will use their default interfaces. It requires that your desktop have two ethernet interfaces.\nSuppose you have a desktop, Ferris, with ethernet interfaces eth0 and eth1. It uses eth0 to connect to your workplace's wired network. Ferris will run Synergy Server.\nYou have laptop, Cameron, with ethernet interface eth0 and wireless interface wlan0. Cameron will run Synergy client.\nConnect Ferris's eth1 to Cameron's eth0 with a network cable. Assign both interfaces static IP addresses in the same subnet. Don't specify DNS servers or default gateways.\nFor example, Ferris's eth1 gets IP address 192.168.100.1 and Cameron's eth0 gets 192.168.100.2. On both, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nConfigure Synergy according to your needs.\nOn Ferris, start Synergy Server with a command like this: synergys -c <path to your synergy config file> -a 192.168.100.1\nOn Cameron, start Synergy like this: synergyc 192.168.100.1\nThis ensures that Synergy only communicates on the little wired network that Ferris shares with Cameron.\n\nA: I've never heard of this being done before. I believe Ubuntu can only handle one connection at a time. Even if you could, the application would have to have it's own ability to connect to the internet, through ethernet or wifi, so I would doubt it would work.

So I think you could just do:\nchown www-data:www-data /my/folder\nchmod 2755 /my/folder\n\nThis sets the setgid special file permission, which would cause all files created in /my/folder to be owned by the www-data group, which has then has rx (5) permission because of the parent directory.\nThe special permission is defined in the first digit using octal notation.

If you need to prevent others from reading files in a directory, revoke the corresponding permissions bits.\nFor example, if you've a directory /home/user/directory with some files and directories which can get permissions like 777 from a process, set the permission bits of /home/user/directory to something like 700. That will make it impossible for other users (excluding the superuser root) to descend in /home/user/directory.\nI'm paranoid and set the permissions on /home/user to 750, so only I can read, write and descend in my home directory. This has as consequence that folders like /home/user/Public cannot be accessed by others, but I can live with that.\n\nPer update of your question: still, you cannot control that in the filesystem (other than using a different filesystem type like FAT which is strongly discougared), you need to do that in your webapp. If your webapp is coded in PHP, you can change the umask on the fly using the umask function:\n<?php\numask(0022);\n// other code\n?>\n\nYou could put this in a configuration file, like the file containing the database connection password (thinking in apps like Wordpress).\nRemember that it's a process value, some webservers allow you to set it in their configuration files, otherwise you could modify the startup scripts to set the desired umask. Remember that permissions like 755 and 644 are quite dangerous for webapps, if the code is sensitive, everyone can read it.\n\nA: To change permissions for a folder use chmod. umask is for files.\nSet umask to what you need by \numask xxx\n\nand change back when your done \numask 022\n\n\nA: Related, but maybe not applicable in this case, the following clip is from .zshrc:\n# Change the umask automatically for some directories; use 0022 as the default\nchpwd () {\n    case $PWD in\n        $HOME/[Dd]ocuments*)\n            if [[ $(umask) -ne 077 ]]; then\n                umask 0077\n                echo -e \"\\033[01;32mumask: private \\033[m\"\n            fi;;\n        */[Ww]eb*)\n            if [[ $(umask) -ne 072 ]]; then\n                umask 0072\n                echo -e \"\\033[01;33mumask: other readable \\033[m\"\n            fi;;\n        /vol/nothing)\n            if [[ $(umask) -ne 002 ]]; then\n                umask 0002\n                echo -e \"\\033[01;35mumask: group writable \\033[m\"\n            fi;;\n        *)\n            if [[ $(umask) -ne 022 ]]; then\n                umask 0022\n                echo -e \"\\033[01;31mumask: world readable \\033[m\"\n            fi;;\n    esac\n}\n\nSo for interactive use, something like that would work (but, obviously, not to provide security).\n", "Q: What is \"umask\" and how does it work? I believe that umask is something that controls file permissions, but do not fully understand it.\nAfter running umask 0644 in a terminal, I cannot read the files I create with the command-line text editor nano. I noticed that the permissions of that file are set to 0022 instead of the default 0755.\nHow does umask work? I thought I could just remove the each digit in the umask from 0777, 7 - 6 = 1 and 7 - 4 = 3, so I expect the permissions to be 0133, but apparently, this is not the case.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is umask exactly? Explain it to me like I was a \"Linux noob\"\n\n*How do I calculate with umask?\n\n*What are use cases for umask?\n\n\nA: Others answered have explained really well the concept of umasking and why it's required. Let me add my two cents, and give you a mathematical example on how the permissions are actually calculated.\nFirst of all, “mask” does not mean “subtract”, in the arithmetic sense – there is no borrow or carry involved.\nSecondly, a “mask” should be understood bitwise instead: applying logical operations on each bit column independently. That is, the 4th bit of the permission bit-sequence interacts with only the 4th bit of the mask.\nThird, the mask turns off permission bits. If they are already off, the umask makes no change to the permission,\nFor example, assume that you have to unmask 077 from the system defaults for files which is 666 and directories which is 777.\nThe command you will use is\numask 077\n\n(unmask value in binary, 000 111 111)\nWhat this unmask will do is it will turn off any of the first six LSBs (least significant bits) if they are 1 and will make no change if any of them are already off.\nHere is how the final permission is calculated:\nfile permission   666 = 110 110 110 \nunmask value      077 = 000 111 111\nwill result in    600 = 110 000 000\n\nObserve how both 110 values have changed to 000.\nSimilarly,\ndirectory permission   777 = 111 111 111 \nunmask value           077 = 000 111 111\nwill result in         700 = 111 000 000\n\n\nA: In addition to the good discussion in the accepted answer, it is worth adding some more points about umask, with reference to how it is managed in 12.04 and onwards.\nUmask and pam_umask\nThe default umask is now in /etc/login.defs and not in /etc/profile, as the official note in /etc/profile reads:\n# The default umask is now handled by pam_umask.\n# See pam_umask(8) and /etc/login.defs.\n\nPam_umask is briefly explained below, and it should be said that the default file for the user to place his custom umask setting in is still ~/.profile. \nPam_umask is one of many important PAM modules that are crucial in Ubuntu's operation (run apropos '^pam_' to find the manpages for the other ones). In the manpage for pam_umask it is noted that\n\npam_umask is a PAM module to set the file mode creation mask of the current environment. The umask affects the\n         default permissions assigned to newly created files.\n\nA note on the default umask\nNew folders in $HOME can be created by mkdir with default 775 permissions and files created with touch with default 664 permissions even when the default umask is 022. This seems, at first, contradictory, and is worth explaining.\nWhile the default umask is 022 on Ubuntu, this is not the whole story, as there is a setting in /etc/login.defs that allows the umask to be 002 for non-root users if a condition is met (see excerpt below). On a normal installation, /etc/login.defs contains the setting USERGROUPS_ENAB yes. This is what\n\nEnables setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits\n   (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is\n   the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.  \n\nHence why you see the following with stat when a new folder is created with mkdir on a single user system such as mine (uid and gid are the same):\nAccess: (0775/drwxrwxr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/username)   Gid: ( 1000/username)\n\nFor more information, see man pam_umask and the\nUbuntu manpages online.\n\nA: This is pretty old, but this is worth mentioning. To calculate for the umask, unlike file system permissions. The octal umasks are calculated via the bitwise AND of the unary complement of the argument using bitwise NOT. The octal notations are as follows:\nOctal value : Permission\n0 : read, write and execute\n1 : read and write\n2 : read and execute\n3 : read only\n4 : write and execute\n5 : write only\n6 : execute only\n7 : no permissions\n\nThen you can calculate to set umask proper premissions such:\n$ umask 077\n$ mkdir dir1\n$ touch file\n$ ls -ld dir1 file\n\ndrwx------ 2 amrx amrx 4096 2011-03-04 02:05 dir1\n-rw------- 1 amrx amrx    0 2011-03-04 02:05 file\n\nCalculating The Final Permission For Files\nYou can simply subtract the umask from the base permissions to determine the final permission for file as follows:\n666 – 022 = 644\n\n\n\n*\n\n*File base permissions : 666\n\n*umask value : 022\n\n*subtract to get permissions of new file (666-022) : 644 (rw-r–r–)\nCalculating The Final Permission For Directories\nYou can simply subtract the umask from the base permissions to determine the final permission for directory as follows:\n777 – 022 = 755\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Directory base permissions : 777\n\n*umask value : 022\n\n*Subtract to get permissions of new directory (777-022) : 755 (rwxr-xr-x)\n\nA: Basic concept:\nIf you are like most humans and don't understand what the heck \"octal umasks are calculated via the bitwise AND of the unary complement of the argument using bitwise NOT\" means, here's my simple explanation:\nFirst of all, think about what a \"mask\" is. A mask blocks something. Think of masking tape. In this case, umask is like masking tape to block/disable permissions when creating a new file or dir.\nThe default permissions when creating a new dir is octal 777 (111 111 111), and a new file is octal 666 (110 110 110). We set the umask to block/disable certain permissions.\n\n\n*\n\n*A mask bit of 1 means to block/disable that permission (put masking tape over that bit).\n\n*A mask bit of 0 will allow the permission to pass through (no masking tape over that bit).\n\n\nSo an octal 022 (000 010 010) mask means to disable group write and others write, and allow all other permissions to pass through.\nCalculation:\nHere is an example calculation for a new file (default 666 permission) with a 022 umask:\n  perm mask result\n----------------------------\nu 1    0    1 (pass through)\n  1    0    1 (pass through)\n  0    0    0 (pass through)\n----------------------------\ng 1    0    1 (pass through)\n  1    1    0 (disable)\n  0    0    0 (pass through)\n----------------------------\no 1    0    1 (pass through)\n  1    1    0 (disable)\n  0    0    0 (pass through)\n\nSo that's how you end up with the result of 644 when you create a new file.\nEasier way:\nBut if inverse mask calculations just confuse you, there is an easier way using symbolic umask notation. When you use this method, then you are just specifying the pass-through bits instead of the mask bits.\n\n\n*\n\n*umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx means allow pass through for user rwx, group rx, other rx. Which implies disable group w, others w. If you run this command then check umask, you will get 022.\n\n*umask u=rwx,g=,o= means allow pass through for user rwx. Which implies disable all access for group and others. If you run this command then check umask, you will get 077.\n\n\nBonus calculation:\nIf you actually want to understand what \"octal umasks are calculated via the bitwise AND of the unary complement of the argument using bitwise NOT\" means, here's some logic tables that can help demonstrate. Remember, a mask bit 1 means disable, 0 means pass through.\nperm mask result\n----------------\n0    1    0     (mask 1 always disables)\n1    1    0     (mask 1 always disables)\n0    0    0     (mask 0 passes through)\n1    0    1     (mask 0 passes through)\n\nIf you make the table with NOT(mask), now it's just a simple AND logic table!\nperm NOT(mask) result\n---------------------\n0    0         0     (mask 1 always disables)\n1    0         0     (mask 1 always disables)\n0    1         0     (mask 0 passes through)\n1    1         1     (mask 0 passes through)\n\nSo the formula for it is: result = perm AND (NOT mask)\n\nA: The umask acts as a set of permissions that applications cannot set on files. It's a file mode creation mask for processes and cannot be set for directories itself. Most applications would not create files with execute permissions set, so they would have a default of 666, which is then modified by the umask.\nAs you have set the umask to remove the read/write bits for the owner and the read bits for others, a default such as 777 in applications would result in the file permissions being 133. This would mean that you (and others) could execute the file, and others would be able to write to it.\nIf you want to make files not be read/write/execute by anyone but the owner, you should use a umask like 077 to turn off those permissions for the group & others.\nIn contrast, a umask of 000 will make newly created directories readable, writable and descendible for everyone (the permissions will be 777). Such a umask is highly insecure and you should never set the umask to 000.\nThe default umask on Ubuntu was 022 which means that newly created files are readable by everyone, but only writable by the owner:\nuser@computer:~$ touch new-file-name\nuser@computer:~$ ls -dl new-file-name\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Apr  1 19:15 new-file-name\n\nStarting in Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10) the default umask was relaxed to 002, which expands write-access to the owner's group:\nuser@computer:~$ touch new-file-name\nuser@computer:~$ ls -dl new-file-name\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 Apr  1 19:15 new-file-name\n\nViewing and modifying umask\nTo view your current umask setting, open a terminal and run the command:\numask\n\nTo change the umask setting of the current shell to something else, say 077, run:\numask 077\n\nTo test whether this setting works or not, you can create a new file (file permissions of an existing file won't be affected) and show information about the file, run:\nuser@computer:~$ touch new-file-name\nuser@computer:~$ ls -dl new-file-name\n-rw------- 1 user user 0 Apr  1 19:14 new-file-name\n\nThe umask setting is inherited by processes started from the same shell. For example, start the text editor GEdit by executing gedit in the terminal and save a file using gedit. You'll notice that the newly created file is affected by the same umask setting as in the terminal.\nUse case: multi-user system\nIf you are on a system that's shared by multiple users, it's desired that others cannot read files in your home directory. For that, a umask is very useful. Edit ~/.profile and add a new line with:\numask 007\n\nYou need to re-login for this umask change in ~/.profile to take effect. Next, you need to change existing file permissions of files in your home directory by removing the read, write and execute bit for the world. Open a terminal and execute:\nchmod -R o-rwx ~\n\nIf you want this umask setting be applied to all users on the system, you could edit the system-wide profile file at /etc/profile.\n\nA: Alright, sometimes a question is more than 10 years old but still without an answer to satisfy your taste, so I'm posting my own. Every process that creates files (or directories) gives those files a default set of read/write/execute permissions. Although we have used the word default here, it doesn't mean a fixed default, i.e., it can change, just like how we can change the behavior of a program by altering its configuration values.\nIt is a pandemically wrong belief in the world of noobs to think that there are some fixed default permission values (such as 664 and 775, or sometimes 755 and 644, and so on) for newly created files and directories. While these numbers can be the default permission values but as we said earlier, they are not fixed (octal) numbers. They can be different for each process.\nSo what is the actual formula for calculating the default permissions for each process? It is 0777 & <mask of the process> for directories and 0666 & <mask of the process> for files (in both of which the & operator is the bitwise-AND, i.e., in laymans terms, it can turn off some bits in 0777, but it does NOT turn any bits on. It's neither negation nor subtraction, it's bitwise-AND).\nNotice 1. man umask does not give the second formula (for files), but don't worry, it's correct.\nNotice 2. There is a legitimate security problem with allowing files to have execute permissions by default. For that reason, systems are usually configured to remove the execute permission for files, thus the 0666 in the second formula above. Directories require execute permission to be navigable though. That is, if for example, /home/ has r permission, you can ls it and see its contents, but without x permission, you can't ls /home/$USER).\nNotice 3. To \"set\" the mask for the process use the umask <proper-value> command. To \"get\" the mask of a process use the umask command alone without any arguments, e.g., gives 0022 in my case when I run it in my terminal.\n", "Q: Sharing Guest Account Disabled In Nautilus when trying to share a folder that is owned by me, i can not share it without a password (Guest Access) as seen on the image.

It has two SATA HDDs in it. The motherboard is an Asus A8n-SLI SE.\nThe computer has two drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA 1 (in bios) - 1TB, Windows XP installation.\n\n*SATA 2 (in bios) - 150GB, empty, the plan is to install Ubuntu on this drive.\n\n\nWhen starting the PC with the regular Ubuntu install CD, at the manual partitioning menu only the 1TB harddisk is shown. However, when running \"sudo fdisk -l\", or checking in GParted, the 150GB drive is shown like it should.\nAfter this I tried uncoupling the 1TB disk. This doesn't help: now in the partitioning menu it doesn't show any hard disks at all.\nI thought it maybe was some problem with the regular Ubuntu installer, so I downloaded and burned the Ubuntu 11.04 alternate installer. This however gives exactly the same problem: it doesn't show any hard disks (with only the 150GB disk plugged in). It gives one notice before the partitioning menu however: it says the installer found harddrive(s) with RAID-configuration and it asks if I want to enable those. It doesn't matter whether I choose \"yes\" or \"no\" -  in both cases, no hard disk shows up in the partitioning menu. In the BIOS, any RAID-configuration is disabled, BTW.\nI hope someone can help me with this problem, because I can't think of any next steps.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: It's quite likely that your HDD has leftovers of a RAID configuration, you can do something like this (on terminal)\n\nsudo dmraid -rE\n\nsee some reference here\n\nA: Have a look at your BIOS settings for your SATA drives.  \nDoes it give you an option of setting \"IDE Compatibility Mode\"?

I was able to turn it off and do software RAID from within Linux (the onboard controller is software RAID anyhow) so I did that. Hopefully this won't break your Windows configuration- I recommend disabling the onboard RAID and then trying to boot into Windows to test this before proceeding.\nParenthetically, this is a very flaky motherboard in other respects.

If your computer is a laptop, you might well have one installed and not know it, as they are often built in to the unit. A desktop computer with a wireless interface will either have an antenna sticking out somewhere (probably the back panel) or a USB device plugged in to it.\nIn Ubuntu, many if not most wireless devices will work \"out of the box\". When you left-click on the Network Manager icon in the upper-right corner of the screen (it looks like a series of signal-strength bars or like an ethernet socket) Network Manager should show you a list of networks. At the top will be \"Wired Networks\", then a list of the connected networks, then a list of available networks, then \"Wireless Networks\" and another set of lists. If you don't have a wireless device or it is unavailable for some reason, there will be no \"Wireless Networks\" section.\nIf you are unsure as to whether you have a functioning wireless device attached to your computer, you can use the commands \"lsusb\" and \"lspci\" to show what devices are connected. If you don't understand the output of the commands feel free to post it here and I will interpret it for you. It's pretty straightforward though!\nIf your investigation shows that you have a connected wireless device, but Network Manager does not show any \"Wireless Networks\", then there are further issues.

However, the Artists box (in the middle of the screen) contained old information (as it was before my edit). \nI thought this would get fixed if I select Tools -> Rescan Media Library. I got a brief message with '100% complete' status, however list of artists (which was modified and changed) remains as it was. \nI have no clue what this means and how to really re-scan the library.\n\nA: First, you must erase the file that save the library information, this file is:\n~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db\nAfter that, you can scan media in Banshee and you will have all the new metadata.\n\nA: Tracks in the file system queue aren't technically part of the media library. It's simply a way to enqueue tracks without having to import them. You may need to 'requeue' them after updating the metadata.\n\nA: I've found that a rescan doesn't 'find' anything with Banshee 2.0.  However, if you import your media library once again (under media/import media), it will import only those files that are new.   You won't get duplicates, as it compares the import against the existing files.\n", "Q: Show running windows in launcher quicklist? I love the quicklist for launchers, and that it shows if multiple windows are open via the arrow indicators. However, it doesn't seem to list the running in the quicklist interface. Is there anyway to have the Unity Launcher list the running windows?\n\nA: As of yet there is none. The quicklists don't update that fast (only after unity --replace or similar events). So it's a technical problem.\nBut that is a feature most users eagerly await. Canonical will eventually give in to this demand. It should would have reduced a great lot of disappointment with unity if showing a quicklist of open windows had been the default behaviour on mouseover from the start.\n", "Q: Which firefox.desktop prevails? If there is a firefox.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications, does it override the firefox.desktop in /usr/share/applications? If not, is there a way to make it do so?\n\nA: The one in ~/.local/share/applications takes precedence over the one in /usr/share/applications. \n", "Q: Who loves Unity interface over Gnome? I recently upgraded to unity interface as part of upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04. I liked everything in the new ubuntu version except the unity interface. Even after spending 3-4 full days with Unity what I can say is I did not like it at all. I hate to downgrade/switch to gnome since I feel I am not supporting unity and the philosophy of using always the best.\nThis is what I found about Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*its fancy but not does not add any\nvalue ( at its current state ) \n\n*harder to perform the operations compared to\ngnome \n\n*very less customizable (more\nlike its forced on me, can not change\nmuch) \n\n*global ( shared ) menus are bad\nfor mouse users since mouse has to\ntravel long distances\n\n\nAm I missing anything ? Is the unity in 11.04 is very limited and has great plans in future ?\n\nA: Try it for a week or two. It's different, but there are some real advantages:\n1. Great if you have a widescreen laptop. The launcher on the side frees vertical space.\n2. The top panel integration with apps is efficient and attractive.\n3. I like that it has a unique interface, not so \"Windows\" in appearance.\n\nA: yes\nfrom the very first day of alpha version i loved new unity and still love it. As said above, so much more free space on the screen with it. instead of 4 panels in gnome 2.3 (bottom panel with tasks manager, top one with menu and notification area, windows title and file-edit menu) we have one tiny panel on top. very clever.\n\nA: Except from some annoyance with compiz and some stuffs. I really do like unity and where it is going. Since it is still very early lets hope it will be polished when we get to 12.04. I love how it gives more space to my laptop and looks very slick.  \nI would also like some additional features such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome Shell like chat popup\n\n*appmenu/global-menu on maximized mode option\n\n\nA: Its not perfect, I don't love it. But as with all things change is inevitable and threatening, it takes us out of our comfort zone.\nI reverted to Classic after 2 or 3 days, then I started to feel that I hadn't learnt enough about it AND I read that classic would not be offerred with 11:10.\nSo now I've been with Unity a few weeks. I'm comfortable with it. \nIt needs to resolve some dual screen issues, some accessibility issues and some flexibility issues. Unity is neither complete or polished. Coming from Windows (or Mac) that is a bit of a shock, but it will improve and even now it is completely usable. i look forward to more improvements.\nI won't be going back\n", "Q: Remove password request after screensaver How do i change my security settings?  \nI want to remove, only the password request that shows after the screen saver turns on. \nI'm new with Ubuntu and have not yet figured out were to find the security menu.\n\nA: Go into 'Preferences -> Screensaver' and make certain that 'Lock screen when screensaver is active' is unchecked.\n\n", "Q: \"Destination Host Unreachable\" on ping After network-manager could not connect to my router which has IP 192.168.1.1.\nI set static ip for my interface.

Please Help \nEDIT:\nifconfig\n\nip route\n\nethtool\n\ntraceroute\n\nThe mii-tool one said unsupported.\n\nA: *\n\n*I assume that when you say 'connects' you mean link-up on the interface ports of your PC and router.\nHowever, I don't understand why that should happen only after you use static-IP -- maybe your interface was configured down initially. \n\n*If your router IP is 192.168.1.1 it is very likely to be a Class-B subnet configuration.\nThis means the netmask would be 255.255.0.0.\nBy using a Class-C netmask and a network number of 192.168.1.0,\nyou have placed your PC in a different subnet from your router.\nThat would explain the ping unreachable case. \nSo, I think you should try with, \n\niface eth0 inet static  \n    address 192.168.1.2  \n    netmask 255.255.0.0  \n    network 192.168.0.0  \n    broadcast 192.168.255.255  \n    gateway 192.168.1.1  \n\nYou can check the physical connectivity with mii-tool.\nIt is part of the net-tools package.  \n", "Q: Desktop edition to Server edition and support \n*\n\n*Ubuntu Desktop will receive 3 years of support, while Ubuntu Server will be supported for 5 years.\n\n\nWell this is what ubuntu server faq says. So my question is can I change a desktop edition \nto server edition and change the support from 3 to 5 years? I hope the support here means the packages update that ubuntu provides. Correct me if I am wrong. If I can How do I do it ? Its the support for LTS release by the way.\n\nA: There are no different repositories for desktop and server packages (hence you can install all available server components in a desktop installation). The difference between desktop and server support with an LTS is just, that server-related packages get updated two years longer. So you won't get five years support for e.g. GNOME applications just because you installed the server version.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One message appearing: You do not have permission? i am trying to sign in to ubuntuone on my droid 2.  i keep getting a message that says the following:\nYou do not have permission to open this page. x-ubuntuone-contacts://syncml.one.ubuntu.com/?p=94768352&u=48325096\nany ideas why, and how to fix?\n\nA: Fixed by the user, who used the default Android browser to sign up for Ubuntu One.\n", "Q: No sound out of MacBook speakers & red LED in headphone jack I have recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Macbook and after a few days I am now getting very low sound from the speakers as well a red LED is glowing in the Headphone jack.\nThe sound is perfect if I connect my headphones but if I use the speakers there is no output.

Since you do not have this light when booting in other OS and the speakers work fine there, the only interpretation left is -- when booted in Ubuntu something is causing your system to think the TOSLink path is active.\nI'd expect your speakers to be quite in Ubuntu while the red light is on. \nHave you tried booting your system from a 11.04 LiveCD -- probably the one you installed from?\nCheck the LED state and the speaker output with that.  \n\nA: I had too low sound and rec light too. Try this.\nNow the sound is better, and click on some IEC958 flags - you should shut the red light down.\n\nA: I just installed the Gnome Alsamixer GUI from the Software Center. \nFirst, I turned the red light (mini-TOSLINK) off by un-checking the box for IEC958.

But after upgrading to 11.04, I got this weird system-colored background behind the Music Note banshee uses as the Notification Area Icon. \n\nIs there anyway to get rid of it? Thanks :)\n\nA: The non-transparent panel background bug was an unfortunate side effect of a workaround to fix a different bug that was causing Banshee to crash.  Luckily, the workaround is no longer needed, so it was removed on May 7 (which should fix the icon issue).  There hasn't been a stable release of Banshee since the 7th, but the problem will go away with the next release.\nIf you want, you can manually remove the workaround that caused this problem.  To quote the bug report, \n\nAs a temporary fix for you, you can\n  edit /usr/bin/banshee and remove the\n  following lines :\n# Work around NowPlaying/webkit crash (bgo#641515) export\n  XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1\n\nNote that this problem only happens with the standard Notification Area icon.

Just modify runlevel 3 or 4 to achieve your needs. In GRUB, add a new line to it with your newly created runlevel.\nIn /etc directory, there are rcX.d directories, which controls services on different runlevels. As I see, rc3.d contains the same links as rc2.d to services in /etc/init.d, so create a new GRUB entry and put \"3\" at the and of the line without quotes (this will start your system on runlevel 3). Start this, set up a different graphical environment. After restart, this entry should meet your needs, I think.\n", "Q: Hide Artha Dictionary Icon from Notification Area in Classic Interface? I'm using Artha Dictionary, and all I want to do is hide its icon from the notification area without loosing its functionality (i.e. Ctrl+W to bring up the meaning of selected word and show the same using NotifyOSD.). The only reason why I want to do it is, Artha's icon is not monochrome and hence doesn't integrate well with rest of the icons showing in the panel.\n\nWhile using Unity, the icon is not shown and I still get proper notifications of word meanings I look up, the icon appears on panel in the classic mode. Removing Notification Area from the panel also removes Artha's functionality. If icon cannot be hidden, I'll prefer to have a monochrome icon for Artha that looks perfect on panel.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open usr/share/pixmaps/artha.png in an image editor.\n\n*a) To make it dissapear:  Resize the icon to 1 pixel in width and paint it transparent.\nb) To change the icon:  Paste any image you want over the top of the existing image.\n\n*Save the image to the Desktop.\n\n*Open Accessories;Terminal and enter the following command replacing zach with your own home folders name:\n\n\nsudo mv '/home/zach/Desktop/artha.png' '/usr/share/pixmaps'\nThe changes should take effect upon restarting your computer.\n\nA: \nWhile using Unity, the icon is not\n  shown and I still get proper\n  notifications of word meanings I look\n  up, the icon appears on panel in the\n  classic mode.\n\nTo enable this, I suggest that you do the following:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nType Alt-F2 and enter \"dconf-editor\"\nNavigate to:\n(Ubuntu 11.04) desktop -> unity -> panel\n(Ubuntu 12.10) com -> canonical -> unity -> panel\nAdd 'artha' to the systray-whitelist, thus:\n['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'scp-dbus-service', 'artha']\n\n...and save it.\nThe artha icon should now appear on the \"panel\" or \"notification area\" (completely close Artha and re-open it).\n\nA: Here is what I did.\nGo to /usr/share/pixmaps.\nRename 'artha.png' to 'artha1.png'\nNow you get this on start:\nWARNING : Error loading icon file!\n/usr/share/pixmaps/artha.png not found!\n\nIf you lose the icon in the menu after doing this:\nGo to /usr/share/applications  and change the icon manually for Artha to /usr/share/pixmaps/artha1.png (usually with right click- Properties).\nI hope in the next update a feature to hide tray icon is included.

I need to extract a bunch of images from a PDF file. pdfimages should do the job. When trying to install, I got two alternatives poppler-utils and xpdf-utils so i wonder, whicht to choose.\nWhere are the differences, what are pros/cons of each alternative?\n\nA: They are forks: used to be the same but someone decided to go another direction. Poppler-utils is the favored one. Debian already removed xpdf-utils from the code base. From Ubuntu bug #697119 and debian bug #622343 they also are in conflict with each other due to sharing the same file names.\nxpdf-utils seems to be better at some things but from the 2nd link: \"These minor regression bugs should be submitted against poppler (preferably upstream poppler) where they can actually get fixed.\"\nPoppler is used in Gimp and Evince so that seems to be your best bet. \n\nA: The poppler library was originally based on xpdf, but improved to better work as a library and to use more modern rendering techniques.\nSo the difference would be that one version is based on the original xpdf code base, while the other comes from the poppler fork.\nSince you are probably already using the poppler library as a PDF viewer, you may as well use the version from poppler-utils.\n", "Q: persistent notification for Unity launcher icons I was delighted to learn about the demands_attention flag as explained here:\nIs there any way to initiate \"urgent animation\" of an icon on the Unity launcher from command line?\nHowever, that notification is very brief - meaning I won't notice when I step away from the keyboard for a minute.\nIs there a way to make that notification persistent so the icon is animated until the respective window is focused again?\n\nA: Turns out this isn't required; setting the demands_attention flag already adds a subtle indicator (blue triangle) to the very top left, which disappears when the respective window is focused again.\n", "Q: Can't find how to change Xbmc mouse speed How can I change in Xbmc mouse speed?\nIn Ubuntu is fine but when I start Xbmc it gets really much too fast...\n\nA: There is no setting in xbmc to change the mouse speed.

That will change the color. You can play around and reduce the saturation, but I'm not sure how you will get a transparent effect.

However, upon upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04 (did not do a fresh install), I began using the 'nvidia-current' package.  In the past I had blacklisted 'nouveau' and I had to reinstall 'nvidia-current' before things would function correctly.\nI apologize for the disjointed response.  I guess I am asking if you are using the 'nvidia-current' package to deliver your video driver.  If this is the case, have you tried reinstalling the package?\n\nA: Relative to installing from the downloaded RUN file, I generally will switch into a TTY with:\nCTRL-ALT-F1\n\nThen you need to kill the X instance.  For this I look for the 'gdm-binary', for example:\nps ax | grep gdm\n\nOnce I have the PID, I use:\nkill -9 XXXXX\n\nThe 'XXXXX' is the PID I identified.  Once X has been terminated, I execute the RUN file.\nsudo sh ./NIVIDIA-whatever-the-rest-of-the-file-name-is\n\nFrom here it is a matter of reading the screens and responding to them.  Generally speaking, I do not let the installer monkey around with Xorg.conf.\n\nA: Happened to me with series 8 integrated NVIDIA hardware after a fresh install of 11.04.  Only thing I could do to make things work is use the expermental 3D open source diver which seems to work very well for compiz gears and games.

If you are on a different version of Ubuntu then we may be able to recover your files if they were in your Ubuntu One folder. Please contact support at https://one.ubuntu.com/support/contact\nUbuntu One should never delete your files without being told to do so. One scenario where files are deleted is when there is a new install of Ubuntu and the ~/.local/share/ubuntuone folder from an old backup is copied to the computer. There is an FAQ about this. Other times when files are being synced between multiple computers, there is confusion about what happens when you delete all the synced files from one computer.

I an experienced Windows user and my intuitions didn't help to achieve this.\n\nA: To quickly add a link (shortcut, alias, whatever) to an application on the desktop, I just use the \"Applications\" menu (top, left hand menu), navigate to the application you want to launch, and then, instead of launching the application, right-click on the menu entry, and select \"Add this launcher to desktop\". \n(If running the old ubuntu classic \"gnome-panel\" (shortcuts & notifications at the top of the screen), you can also \"add this launcher to panel\", which was the equivalent of windows taskbar, I guess.) \nNote / personal preference: Some of the classic tricks & tips no longer apply to the \"unity\" desktop; however, if you should so desire, you can login to ubuntu with the \"ubuntu classic\" option and still do things the old-fashioned way. After installing \"gnome-do\" and \"docky\", I'm a happier camper than with the new Unity desktop...  But, if you're new to ubuntu and have 11.04, you may be perfectly satisfied with the new look & feel.\n\nA: In the file manager Nautilus, right-click on the file or folder you want to create a shortcut to, select Make Link:\n\nThis will create a new link file (called Link to ) in the same directory:\n\nYou then move it to the desktop by right-clicking the link file and choosing Move to → Desktop:\n\n\nYou can rename the link to whatever you like.

I fixed the remote gui client by locating the URL in the settings and appending a / to the end of /transmission/rpc, so that I had /transmission/rpc/ \nthis made it work normally except for the occasional timeout issues which i think has less to do with a setting and more to do with the sheer load (although it's only pushing 10mb/sec on gigabit down and 5mb/sec up (though that's just my portion if this is a shared box)\n", "Q: How to fix install of Python 2.5.4? I tried to install python 2.5.4 on Ubuntu 11.04. I need to be able to remove my original installation of this older python, and then get instructions on installing. Further, will I have to tell the system which python to use or will it figure it out?\n\nA: You need to tell scripts which version of python they should be using, otherwise the system will choose for you and it will always be the same one. There is an environment variable that also controls the python version executed when the script uses the envvar bang line (instead of #!/usr/bin/python).\nIf you need an older version of python, you should try to install it via a debian package. If you can't find one, then you should not install it and simply use a binary package in /opt and redirect all your scripts to use that python. I presume you might not know how to use chroot or anything similar.\n", "Q: Keyboard command/shortcut to resize window The bottom of my (Chromium) window is off the bottom of the screen.  If I move the window up, Unity maximises the window (which I do not want).\nWhat key combination can I press to make the active window shorter (smaller)?\n\nA: I find Alt + right-click + drag to be the most convenient way to do this.\n\nA: Right-click the title bar, select Resize and then control the window size with the mouse.  \n\nA: As there is no mention of the shortcut using super key I will add it.\nThis is complete keyboard shortcut, which has a super key(key with windows symbol).\nJust press super key + ctrl and then use arrow keys to resize the window. Arrow Up and Down keys maximize and minimize current window respectively.\nBonus Tip: Hold the super key and a short cut menu pops up with all possible short cuts.Tested on ubuntu 14.04 and works on 16.04 also.\n\nA: Hold down Alt and press space. \nThen press R on your keyboard. You can now use the arrows to resize the window.\n\nA: You can press Alt + F8 and your mouse pointer will automatically switch to a resizing pointer, which you can use to resize your window either with the mouse or using the arrow keys.\nYou can then click or press esc to stop and turn your normal pointer back on.\n\nA: I tend to use alt + middle-drag to resize windows.\nIt's not pure keyboard but it is useful in awkward situations (like this)\n\nA: The combo is different in Ubuntu (Unity) and Kubuntu (KDE).\nUbuntu 16.04 defaults to Alt + middle mouse button and then drag with mouse.\nKubuntu with KDE 5.8 defaults to Alt + right mouse button and then drag with mouse.\nPlace mouse on one of the nine edges, and then drag in the direction you want to upsize or downsize.\n\nA: The resize window key combination for LXDE is:\nHold down Alt and press space. \nThen press Z on your keyboard. You can now use the arrows to resize the window. (If you have not pressed Alt-space this session, there might be a short delay of about half a second.)\n(Pressing R will Roll Up/Down [minimise] the window.)\nClick the mouse or press Esc to regain normal control of your keyboard.\n\nA: Resize a window by dragging the edges or corner of the window.

Past experience has taught me never to test out unfamiliar media players on my existing media library, lest nosy \"convenience\" functions automatically rearrange, re-tag, sloppily import into, or otherwise alter my carefully-curated data.\nHow can I expose my music to such a player in a read-only fashion?\n\nA: I will show two methods that do not require to alter the files in the media library.\nAccessing data from another user\nCreate a new (non administrative) user otheruser, add it to your group:\nsudo gpasswd -a otheruser $USER\n\nModify your home to grant read and execute permissions for the group members (this is required if you have an encrypted home partition):\nchmod g+rx $HOME\n\nThen switch to otheruser, that should have now read access to all your data.\nI should point out that, if you have an encrypted home partition, the other user could access your data as long as you are logged in. So you should login then switch user without loggin out from the first user.\nPretend to modify permissions\nThe package bindfs allow to mount a given directory with altered permissions, so the steps could be:\nInstall the package\nsudo apt-get install bindfs\n\nCreate a mount point and assign it to your user\nsudo mkdir /media/home-altered\nsudo chown $USER:$USER /media/home-altered\n\nMount the real home to the mount point without write permissions:\nsudo bindfs -p a-w $HOME /media/home-altered\n\nNow, in /media/home-altered you will see your home directory with altered permissions, and accessing data through that path prevent to modify the data.\nEDIT\nAlmost the same effect of the second method can be obtained with a bind mount and a read-only remount:\nsudo mkdir /media/$USER\nsudo mount --bind /home/$USER /media/$USER\nsudo mount -o remount,ro /media/$USER\n\n\nA: Ok this is far-fetched but I sometimes do this when I really want to preserve/protect a file as it is. \nSo would you bother setting all of your music files to immutable even temporarily? Even root can't edit when the immutable bit is enabled.\nchattr +i FILENAME \nOh but sadly it's only limited to EXT file systems. And I totally relate to your predicament.

When printing from Firefox, the font size of headers/footers (Title, URL, Page, Date) is noticeably larger in Ubuntu when compared to Windows. The larger font means less of the Title and URL headers show on the page. And it also takes away space from the page's main content.\nIs there a way to make the font smaller? Changing the \"Content\" preferences in Firefox to a smaller font size has no effect on the headers and footers. But regardless, I only want to reduce the font size of the headers/footers, not the page's main content.\n\nA: It's not configurable right now, though it would be possible to improve Firefox to make it configurable.\nIt looks like this is where that font is configured, in the Mozilla source code.

Now I need a simple way of calculating (with bash) how many hours have passed since that date (default is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm). \nThe only way I can think of doing this is by using several ifs, but I was hoping there might be a quick one-line method. Perhaps using the date command? \nJust an example for clarity:\nRight now it is 2011-05-23 12:16.\nThe first command outputs 2011-05-22 08:34.\nI need a command (or a few piped commands) that output 27, as in: \"27 hours (rounded down) have passed since the specified date\".\nIs there a quick'n simple way to achieve that? Or am I bound to use conditionals (not that it'd be overly complex).\n\nA: Generally speaking for times in Unix it's simplest to convert both datetimes into Unix Timestamps (that are seconds since 1970-1-1 00:00), subtract one from other and, in your case, divide by 3600 to get the hours.\nSECONDS=`expr $(date -d \"20110523\" +%s) - $(date -d \"20110522\" +%s)`\nexpr $SECONDS / 3600\n\n#Return is 24\n\n", "Q: How can I install haskell-platform?

I am not sure if this is the proper place for this question, so my apologies if it is not.\nI want to switch from Windows to Ubuntu, or at least have an additional operating system next to windows. I have tried Ubuntu before but never really liked the text editors and R console I found. The main things I need to do is programming in R, compiling packages, compiling C++ (with Rcpp + inline) and writing LaTeX documents (with Sweave).\nSo I was wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Ubuntu a good Linux distribution for statistical programming?\n\n*What is a good text editor for Ubuntu?\n\n*What is a good R console / IDE for Ubuntu?\n\n*What is a good LaTeX editor / distribution for Ubuntu\n\n\nA: Here are my two cents:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes. I'm a statistician and have been professionally using Linux-based Operating systems for almost a decade. There are GNU/Linux versions of all major statistical software such as SAS, SPSS, Stata and, of course, R, which feels right at home on Unix systems. Moreover, Linux distros tend to be less resource-hungry than their competitors, so you might even notice your programs run faster on GNU/Linux than on Windows or Mac.\n\n*Emacs is really popular among power users, but for simple text editing I prefer LibreOffice Writer (especially when I'm working with Microsoft Word users).\n\n*My favorite R IDE is RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/), by a mile! It hasn't gone stable yet, and has a few annoying bugs, but nothing that would compromise the quality of your work. I find it very intuitive, and the fact that it's multi-platform really helps my workflow, since I also work on Microsoft and Apple machines.\n\n*If you're using LaTeX with R, RStudio's got you covered! It allows you to write and compile pure LaTeX as well as LaTeX + Sweave or knitr. RStudio's LaTeX editor is decent, but if you're writing more complex texts and want something with more features (it's pretty easy to get lost inside long documents), I'd recommend Texmaker (http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/); it probably has all the features you're asking for... and then some!\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, though some people I know found switching from WinEdt a bit hard.\n\n*I like gedit, the default text editor in Ubuntu, though there are a lot of other text editors that are also good. A matter of personal preference.\n\n*Try RKWard in the Ubuntu Software centre.\n\n*By searching in the Ubuntu software centre for \"LaTeX\" you will get some good results. I would try Texmaker.\n\n\nA: For Latex I like Texmaker. You can download it from the Software Center but it's outdated, so I recommend grabbing the lastest version from their website. Alternatively you could also take a look at Kile.\nRegardless of the editor you choose, you need a Latex compiler like TexLive, it's also in the software center.\n\nA: Kile might be my favourite LaTeX editor, although it has the downside of depending on about 40% of the KDE desktop.  (This isn't really a big deal, but it does integrate better with Kubuntu than with Ubuntu.)  Another downside is that you have to install TeXLive separately for some reason.  A plus is that Kile integrates with JabRef, which makes BibTex management a snap. \nMy next choice is TexMaker.  One of the nice things about TexMaker is that it has all the main LaTeX components as dependencies, so installing TexMaker also installs everything you're likely to need to compile your documents.  (The only thing I've found missing in 3+ years was a font needed to use an Elsevier document class for a manuscript I was submitting - this was in an additional package.)  No JabRef integration though.\nIf you're used to installing LaTeX + WinEdt on Windows (or TeXShop on a Mac) the install with TeXMaker is a pleasant surprise: Search for it in the Software Centre, click install, go grab a coffee, and you'll be ready to go when you get back.  (or sudo apt-get install texmaker if you don't mind the command line.)\nBoth Kile and TexMaker handle larger projects with many input files well; Kile has a nice Quick Build in that it automatically runs (for example) PDFLaTeX + BibTeX + PDFLaTeX (x2) so that all the references are updated.\n\nA: In order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, as the R packages are well maintained, and you get the CRAN builds of R so you are not even lagging behind.\n\n*I like Emacs. (Also see dozens of posts at StackOverflow and other StackExchange sites  on editor choice.)\n\n*I like Emacs with ESS. (Dito for R editor choices.)\n\n*I like Emacs with AucTex.\n\n\nAll snickering aside, many R Core members use the same combination of Emacs + ESS + AucTex.\nAlso, while learning Emacs is surely a good thing in the long run, there are many decent editors in Ubuntu that can be used for R, LaTeX and C++.  Some folks seem to like Geany; I am sure you can find something suitable too.  \n", "Q: Can I set a default syntax highlighting in Gedit? Until you save a document in gedit, syntax highlighting is turned off. There are obviously good reasons for this -- people might get confused if certain words were randomly showing up in different colors.  But for my purposes, I use gedit almost exclusively for HTML editing.\nA lot of times I paste snippets of code into a new gedit document for quick editing, and I have to manually set the syntax coloring to HTML.  Other times, I open ColdFusion (.cfm) documents, which gedit apparently doesn't recognize, and again I have to manually set the color to HTML.  Both of these inconveniences would be fixed if I could find a way to tell gedit to automatically use HTML syntax highlighting for new documents and documents without a recognized file extension.  Is this possible?\n\nA: This is not possible without modifying the source code of Gedit or writing a plugin to override the default. The default syntax highlighting scheme is hard-coded.\n\nA: You can at least add file extensions in the html syntax coloring scheme by editing html.lang in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ as a super user. So say you want to add HTML syntax highlighting to cfm files, you'd change this\n<property name=\"globs\">*.html;*.htm</property>\n(default html.lang) into this \n<property name=\"globs\">*.html;*.htm;*.cfm</property>\n\nA: You can create your own language definition files in your $HOME directory. Editing the gtk language specs is not recommended as it will be overriden by every gtksourceview update.\nCopy your language specs file to your home directory:\n$ cp /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/html.lang ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/\n\nThen, add  your custom file formats like .cfm to the list of extensions:\n<property name=\"globs\">*.html;*.htm;*.cfm</property>\n\nThat way gedit will use auto syntax highlighting on your custom file formats and gtk updates wont override your custom changes.\n\nA: There is a conflict in the files\n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/sml.lang\nand /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/xml.lang\nBoth have the .sml extension associated with it.\nTo get Standard ML syntax highlighting automatically you need to erase .sml from /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/xml.lang.\n", "Q: How are flags used in linux for file protection? I am unsure about the term flags used in Linux as I have recently heard of them, whilst doing educational research. And from what I am aware of 'flags' is they are used within directory's to show the access permissions for a particular file. So my real question is, how are they used? where can I see them myself? and tell me if im missing something obvious then tell me, as I thinking this maybe the case. \nThank you for your time :) \n\nA: The only time i've come across the word 'flag' in a context even remotely related to file protection was was 'read flag' and 'write flag'. That was just a fancy way of saying 'permissions'. As in 'clipboard.sh has no 'read flag' and 'PERswitch.pl' has an 'excute flag':\nconfus@confus:~/bin$ ll\n-rw-------  1 root   root    1863 2011-05-13 00:23 clipboard.pl\n-rwxr--r--  1 confus confus  3331 2011-05-06 01:46 PERswitch.pl*\n\nSo could be, that you missing something that obvious. But I don't think thats it. That would be just babytown frolics.\n", "Q: How to bulk rename files numerically, in order of modification date? I've got some photos with quite random names, but the dates (not exif, but when they were last edited) are correct. I'd like to rename them in that order, preferably so that the first photo is named 1.jpg and so on, but anything goes.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: In the directory containing the pictures, run:\nmkdir renamed; num=0; for f in $(ls -t); do cp -p \"$f\" renamed/IMG_$(printf \"%03d\" $num).jpg; num=$((num+1)); done\n\nThis will copy the files to a new directory renamed, keeping timestamps untouched. The format will be IMG_###.jpg with three-digit numbers, using leading zeros. You can change the number of digits by changing the %03d part.\n\nA: Try PyRenamer. I have just installed it and it seems very powerful. It allows you to rename your images based on their metadata.\n", "Q: How can I create a hidden ad-hoc network?

The problem now is that I would like to hide the SSID but can't find any where to do so in network manager or iwconfig. Anyone know if this is possible?\n\nA: I've done some searching online and it appears to me that it is not possible to hide the SSID, at least not if it's an ad-hoc network.\nI think this might help explain it: http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/2008-August/018305.html\n", "Q: Show visualization instead of album art in Totem? How can I set Totem to show the visualization instead of the album art when I am playing a sound track?\n\nA: As far as I can tell, when embedded cover art is available, Totem will always use it.

Then when I rebooted into 2.6.35-28 I got the same /dev/mapper/isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 error that I got with 2.6.38-9.\n\nA: Look at this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1719850.html\nDo you have a promise Raid? If it's so, looks like it fits your problem. There's another entry here about that:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1719850.html\nSo it's a bug from Ubuntu installation and the dmraid package. \nTo sum everything, looks like there's a ppa with the update in it:\nppa: psusi/ppa\n\n\nA: The solution patch to my problem should have been painfully obvious:\nALERT!  /dev/mapper/isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 does not exist \n\nisw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 is part of the boot options in grub:\nkernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-28-generic root=/dev/mapper/isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 ro splash quiet\n\nFor whatever reason upon upgrading isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 is now called isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume0p1 (ultimately pointing to /dev/dm-1). So by changing isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume01 to isw_jhdfjbgej_Volume0p1 in the boot configuration, my system booted up properly.\nWhy the volume's name under /dev/mapper changed, I have no idea.\n\nA: It might be worth trying to use the live cd upgrade method if not for the first time then again. I know I had trouble after being messing with Gnome 3 and could only get it working again by inserting a live cd in and selecting install, then upgrade from 10.10 which is one of the options? That way as you are upgrading not reinstalling your data is safer.\nDo you have much data already on your system and can you back it up. Again if you are unsure, boot up using a live cd/pen drive and navigate into your old home folder and back up what you can first. Then at least if you get stuck you can be sure you have some data backed up. Apologies if you know this already or have already done so.\nLet us know how you get on.\n", "Q: How should I read a file of type \"text/calendar\"?

Now you should be able to quickly add torrent files to Deluge 1.2+ WebUI in Chrome!\nTested on 11.10. For other OS'es you must try out yourself, but I expect it'll work fine on them too.\n\nA: The answer is in fact a bug in deluge packaging (or, perhaps deluge is the same & everything else changed around it... depends on your perspective, I guess.)  See the forum topic here for the details.\nBasically, setting up xdg-open's config via gconf-editor didn't do anything to resolve the issue, since as of Natty the file-open functionality is handled by gvfs-open, which doesn't use gconf settings. Rather, gvfs-open looks at the \".desktop\" files bundled with each application to determine what file types can be handled (if not installed, run sudo apt-get install gvfs-bin).\nFrom the forum posting, the /usr/share/applications/deluge.desktop file has a couple issues; it should say Exec=deluge-gtk %U (rather than just \"Exec=deluge-gtk\") so that the argument is passed to the application. Second, rather than just MimeType=application/x-bittorrent; it should say MimeType=application/x-bittorrent;x-scheme-handler/magnet;.  \nThe update should be coming through soon...

You can go to Edit -> Preferences -> Other -> and associate default magnet links with Deluge.\n\nA: It looks like now the latest releases (ppa) of Deluge did address the points of the selected answer. However that didn't solve my problem with Google Chrome not launching Torrents in my Ubuntu Precise 12.04.\nRather it looked like the xdg-mime used by xdg-open was not set properly. I found here a working solution. i.e.\n$ xdg-mime default deluge.desktop x-scheme-handler/magnet\n$ xdg-mime default deluge.desktop application/x-bittorrent\n\nThen a quick check\n$ xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/magnet\ndeluge.desktop\n$ xdg-mime query default application/x-bittorrent\ndeluge.desktop\n\nAnd now it's at last working fine.\n\nA: for me what worked is i went to mimeapps.list file and added tixati as the default magnet handler - its very easy and works fast . \nCreate desktop shortcut link of the bittorrent client then . \nGo to this file --** ( press Ctrl+H ) to show/hide files from view..\n/home/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\nOpen the file -mimeapps.list - type this text \n *  x-scheme-handler/magnet=tixati.desktop\nclick save to the application.\nI use tixati for torrent . if u use another bittorrent client -- just replace tixati with other - eg vuze , deluge, .

I wanted to use qBittorrent. On Ubuntu 14.04 I removed Transmission using: \nsudo apt-get purge transmission-gtk\n\nThen I 'manually' started qBittorrent and closed it again. The next time I clicked a magnet link I was prompted by Chrome to allow it to call an external application. I allowed this and chrome then fired up qBitorrent. \nSo it seems that if you don't need to have more than one torrent client on your PC, by removing the others and leaving the one you want, you can force Chrome to use the desired client. A bit of a Chuck Norris solution, but it worked for me.\n", "Q: Possible to format/create partitions with Clonezilla? I am wondering if its possible to create/format/resize partitions with clonezilla? \n\nA: You can partition and format a drive if you have booted a system with a Clonezilla Live CD/DVD by obtaining a command line prompt, which is one of the menu options you will see after booting from the CD or DVD. Then use fdisk to partition the drive and mkfs.ext3 to format the drive. E.g., if the drive you wish to partition and format is identified by /dev/sdb you could obtain a command prompt and issue the fdisk command below to create a new partition on the drive.\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb\n\nYou could then partition the drive within fdisk. After partitioning the drive you could format partition 1 on the drive with the ext3 file system with the command below:\nsudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1\n\nOr you could substitute another file system type for ext3, e.g., ext2, ext4, msdos, ntfs, vfat.\nE.g., see Partitioning and formatting a disk drive with Clonezilla.\nIf you wish to resize a drive formatted with the NTFS file system, you can use the ntfsresize command.\nWhen you have finished with the drive changes, you can get back to the Clonezilla menus with sudo clonezilla\n\nA: It's not possible with just Clonezilla, but you could use Parted Magic, a live cd that includes, among others, both Clonezilla and the Gparted partition manager.\n\n\n", "Q: Download Source to Build Application Myself Many Open Source projects provide their source code in different version, for the various systems such as Windows, Debian, Fedora etc. Since Ubuntu is Debian based, should downloading the project for Debian suffice and I won't have to do any modification to it?\nOne example I would like to give is Code::Blocks, they have a project source file for Debian and none for Ubuntu.

So you do not need to replace it under Linux.\nIf you like to install it on Ubuntu or other distros go to:\nhttps://snapcraft.io/irfanview\n\nA: The closest thing on Linux is XnView. Qua interface, you won't have problems. I use GwenView for viewing/rotating and XnView for what GwenView can't do.\n\nA: The good replacement is gthumb. You can easily install it through Ubuntu Software Center. It has all functions that you require.\n\nA: Nomacs is the best replacement for me. To install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nomacs/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nomacs\n\n\nA: I suggest you the XnViewMP.

Before I go change my partition type from EXT3 to NTFS in my Ubuntu machine, I wanted to confirm will it affect or corrupt the files present in the disk.\nIt would help if you know a problem or share any problem that you might have experienced doing this kind of stuffs.\n\nHOW:\n  I saw in Ubuntu you have a package called Disk Utility which will help you change the partition, but if you think there is a better way to get this done, please don't mind sharing it. Thanks.\n\nI tried Google to find the answer but you can't get an answer for everything, so decided to ask the experts here. Please help.\nI know this is not useful, but for those who have a dual OS with WINDOWS it could be useful to share files between Windows and Linux.\n\nA: Changing EXT3 to NTFS will DESTROY ALL YOUR FILES.\nIn order to do so without loosing files, you would need to copy all your files somewhere, change partition type (reformat) and then copy files back.\nNote that NTFS is not suitable for Ubuntu. However Ubuntu may read and write NTFS partitions. Therefore the best 2 options for you would probably be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have one big partition for Windows (NTFS) and smaller one for Ubuntu (ext3/4). Store the common files (e.g. documents, mp3, movies) on your Windows partition. Then you are able to read and write them from both operating systems.\n\n*Create a 3rd partition - either NTFS or FAT32 and store all common files there. It would be visible as disk \"D:\" in Windows and you may read and write it from Ubuntu too.\n\nA: The essential part of any UNIX , is file ownership .When you considering to change file system it's not best option,file ownership will be lost. \nThere are several ways:\n - Run Linux in http://www.virtualbox.org/  virtual Linux\n - Another option to have  shared partition between windows and Linux ..\nIn my case i have SVN in which i put source code i share it between several pc and several OS'es.\nFor common data like movie,music i keep them on external USB HDD\n\nA: If you need to change the partition type from EXT* to NTFS, the best way to do it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all files to any backup drive (physical, network, etc.)\n\n*Format the partition with NTFS filesystem\n\n*Copy the files back\n\n\nNote that you should NOT do this if you want to continue running Linux from this partition (e.g. it's your / or /home or any other important directory). Because current NTFS drivers (e.g. NTFS-3G) do not support any file mode flags except rwxrwxrwx. \n\nA: There are many softwares that allow you to correctly detect and mount an ext2-3 linux partition in a windows box. \n\n\n*\n\n*FS-Driver for ext2/3 (freeware)\n\n*DiskInternals for ext2/3/4, ReiserFS (free trial) \n\n*Ext2Fsd (freeware)\n\nA: This is not exactly an answer to your question but if the goal is to simply share files between linux and windows, I would recommend shrinking your existing partitions and creating a new FAT32 partition which can be used to share files between the two OS. I dont have good experience of using NTFS in Linux and a really bad one of trying to access EXT3 partition in Windows.\nMany of the security related benefits in Linux come from file permissions and if you change your file system to NTFS you will lose these benefits. Also there are some programs which expect certain file permissions on their config files and wont run without them. So moving to NTFS may break those programs as well.\n", "Q: How to burn ISOs with LXDE + Ubuntu? I am trying to burn ISOs with Ubuntu installed with LXDE. In the right click menu, I think Archive Mounter is what I am supposed to use? But when I click that, nothing happens. What can I use to burn ISOs, then?\n\n\nA: Install brasero  and use that to burn your isos.\n\nA: Another suggestion you can try for lightweight CD burner from XFCE desktop environment package: xfburn\n\nA: Might as well chime in with a recommendation of K3b for burning ISO's onto optical disks :) \nhttps://userbase.kde.org/K3b\nIf xfburn (as suggested by Lye Heng Foo) or Brasero (as suggested by RolandiXor) don't get good results for you then definitely give it a try.\nI suspect xfburn will be the lightest, so might suit your Lubuntu/LXDE setup better. \nKDE applications (like K3b) do tend to have quite a lot of dependencies due to utilising the KDE Frameworks, so if you don't already have a lot of those libraries already installed by other programs then it can look quite daunting at first, but I don't think it's a particularly 'heavy' application in itself.\nIt was a long time ago, so Brasero has very likely improved a lot since then, but I had an optical drive that was past it's best and was using cheap 'write once' optical discs and when Brasero failed to complete the job, the disc was useless.\nInstead of getting a less terrible optical drive burner, I wasted a bunch of disks and then tried my luck with K3b, with much more successful results.\nEntirely anecdotal as evidence, so don't take my shoddy equipment story as anything other than that, but if you're not getting good results with anything else then it's definitely worth a look.\n", "Q: Git basics, How can I grab files from git? I am new to git so chances are there is a simple answer. \nI have a git command for grabbing a site\ngit clone git@devel.foobar.com:foob.com.git\n\nNow when I run this I am prompted for a password via GUI.(Enter a password to unlock the private key) My local root, and user passwords don't work.\nwhat's going on? Do I need to get a password from the git repository manager?\nEDIT- Sorry, It was for grabbing drupal sites. I thought this may have been a common issue among others here.\n\nA: You answered it yourself in the question.\nThe password is the password/passprase you make locally when you create an ssh key. So if you set your password for the ssh key to foobar , then the password that you would need to enter when it asks you would be foobar - your password probably (and should be!) different, that's just an example.\nIf you forgot your password, then you should create a new one. For instructions on how to do that, take a look here.\n\nA: Answer is - password is the passphrase you make locally when you create an ssh key.\n", "Q: Prevent launcher from showing when Super key is merely held down or when it's combined with another key Context\nI like using the Super key as a modifier key as part of various keyboard shortcut combinations.\nFor example, as part of grid I have two shortcut keys (Super+H and Super+L) that put windows to the left and right respectively.\nHowever, when ever I use these shortcut keys the Unity launcher menu is displayed as well.\nThis does not happen when I press Windows+1,2,3.\nI also like the fact that in general the Unity launcher menu is triggered by the Super key (i.e., when not pressed in combination with another key). So I don't want to disable it completely.\nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way of preventing the Unity launcher menu from displaying when the Super key is combined with another key?\n\n\nA: You probably can't get the functionality you want without making some edits to Unity itself. (Requires programming knowledge)\nThere's no clear way to tell the difference between the two cases. Either Unity can bind to key press/release events on Super (which won't see other keys being pressed while it's held) or it can bind to key combinations, in which case it won't see Super except as a modifier on whatever key that was pressed in combination with it.\nIt should, theoretically, be possible to achieve the functionality you want by having Unity use XGrabKeyboard when you press Super and and XUngrabKeyboard when you release it, but it's not exactly common to go whole-hog on it. \nWhat I usually see in things like IceWM and Windows is for there to be a global keybinding on the Super key and then local keybindings on the window that it calls up for things like Super+R (Windows Run... dialog) and so on.\nMy advice would be to rebind your launcher shortcut to something almost as easy to hit as a bare Super. (I use Super+Space for the copy of gmrun I use in Lubuntu which matches nicely with using Ctrl+Space and Alt+Space for other launchers like SiteLauncher in Firefox)\n\nA: Open CompizConfig Settings manager and into the Ubuntu unity plugin section. click the x next to the \"key to show the launcher\" option to disable it.\n\nA: You could download confity http://sourceforge.net/projects/confity/. After you've un tared it you should click on uiSelcectoinDialog.py (Make shore it's excuteble) press ok, at the bottom you can change the short cuts or remove then. It come's with some extra handy things make to unity a bit more customizable. \n\nA: From what you're asking in the question and from what you're saying in the comments of other answers, this seem to be what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Super should be used in combination with other keys\n\n*You want to show the launcher when you press and hold super\n\n*Pressing super+num (1-9) should open and/or switch to an application\n\n*You do not want to show the launcher when you use it in combination with other keys than 1-9. \n\n\nThis is impossible. The only solution I can think of, is to set a delay for how quickly the launcher shows, but this would be annoying if that's what you want to do. It would also make it much more difficult to get used to that functionality, which would make it less user friendly. \nIf you have any ideas for how this could be done, feel free to write an email to Ayatanas mailinglist. \n", "Q: Will a Virtual Box Installation have low Disk performance I understand that if you install Ubuntu on Windows using Wubi, there are disk performance issues since the entire system is mostly concentrated on a single file.\nWhat about the case of a Virtual Box, will it have improved performance over just installing on Windows with Wubi, or underneath they are the same thing.\n\nA: Ubuntu running inside VirtualBox on Windows will not have a better performance than Ubuntu installed wihtout separate partition (thus using file on Windows file system). Most likely the performance will be worse.\nIn the first case, you have a file on Windows FS + virtual machine; In the second case, you still have a file on Windows FS but no virtual machine.\n", "Q: Window Placement on Unity doesn't open programs on workspaces 3 and 4, how can I fix it? I'm working on an article for my site about using window placement rules.

Can someone help me out with this problem?\n\nA: So i fixed the problem... To place/open programs on workspace 3 and 4 you also need to change the Y Viewport Positions. For opening programs on workspace 1 and 2 you only need to set the X Viewport position and leave Y viewport on 1. To open programs on workspace 3 change X Viewport Position to 1 and Y Viewport Position to 2.

Unfortunately the HP Compaq 6000 Pro only has VGA and DisplayPort - it doesn't have DVI since it is a small form factor. I don't have a DisplayPort>DVI Adapter either, but this shouldn't make a difference, it would appear to be an intel/xorg problem with recognizing the DisplayPort device.\nCould anybody suggest a way to debug this problem? Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: There is a bug with the intel driver that seems to be a similar issue but instead of the DVI port it's the s-video ports and in some cases it has been the VGA out as well.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/763688\nIf you haven't marked it as effecting you, please do so. \nThis particular bug appears to be xserver-xorg-video-intel which also can be seen in Kubuntu and even other distros that use this same driver (I have seen it in Fedora 15 as well).\n\nA: Do you use DisplayPort->DVI adapter?

About a week ago I backed up her /home directory using rsync, and kept it on an external HD.\nNow, she got a new laptop with Ubuntu 11.04.\nI am still pretty new to the Ubuntu file system, so my question is this: Can I just rsync an Ubuntu 10.04 /home backup onto an Ubuntu 11.04 machine? Are there any directories I should not copy from the backup?\n\nA: There are a great many differences between how Gnome is configured in 10.04 and how it's configured in 11.04. While you might loose some settings from the 10.04 desktop I would strongly recommend leaving the .gconf, .gnome, .gnome2, .gnome2_private, .gconf, .gconfd, .config, and .conf folders behind. Moving these over from 10.04 to 11.04 have a high potential for corrupting the desktop. I would also recommend making a tar'd backup of the /home folder prior to any moves.\n\nA: Since you've used rsync you should have an exact copy of your friend's dir on your machine. There should not be any problems with copying between any other machines now.\nThe only to take care of is file owner.\n", "Q: Windows jutter from place to place in classic desktop with ATI driver I just uninstalled Gnome 3 and had to reactivate my ATI driver, it should now be working fine but it isn't. \nI'm using Ubuntu 11.04 with the classic theme and when I drag the windows around they jutter from place to place, this never used to happen.\nHow can I fix the lag?\nCheers,\n\nA: Most likely it's related to the \"Sync to VBlank\"\nFirst - make sure you have CCSM installed.

I heard that sticking with ext3 is wiser. Is that true?\nEDIT: One thing I want to note is that I am a dual OS user (Windows & Ubuntu), so not being able to mount a drive (ext4) from Windows is a big negative for me. But, ext3 has this privilege.\n\nA: A few years ago I'd say stick with ext3 but nowadays ext4 is better. A recent (May 16, 2011) round up from thegeekstuff.com sums it up rather nicely:\n\n*\n\n*Supports huge individual file size and overall file system size.\n\n*Maximum individual file size can be from 16 GB to 16 TB\n\n*Overall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte). 1 EB = 1024 PB (petabyte). 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte).\n\n*A directory can contain a maximum of 64,000 subdirectories (as opposed to 32,000 in ext3)\n\n*You can also mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it).\n\n*Several other new features are introduced in ext4: multiblock allocation, delayed allocation, journal checksum, fast fsck, etc. All you need to know is that these new features have improved the performance and reliability of the filesystem when compared to ext3.\n\n*In ext4, you also have the option of turning the journaling feature off.\n\nA very good comparison from 2009 on linuxologist.com has a graph about write performance with 4 GB:\n\nand also has some other information on ext4.\nI myself have had zero problems with ext4.\nIf you need to share a partition with Windows you will need ext3.\nI myself have given up on Windows so I have everything set to ext4 and use a USB stick to transfer data to a Windows machine (mainly at work).\nWhat you can do for a setup is the following:\n/ ext4\nswap\n/home  ext4\n/datapartiton_with_windows ext3\n\nThen you can make the last one a shared partition for both OS's.\n\nA: The only reasons I can think of at the current time not to use ext4 are compatibility with older systems, and, last time I tried it, ext4 had problems with losing data when used on flash media (ie. Thumb drives et cetra.)  That second one I haven't tested in about six months, so it may have been fixed.  Otherwise, the performance and reliability are large improvements over ext3.\nEdit:  Ten years later, the data corruption on cheap USB flash devices has most certainly been fixed and some distros aren't bothering to enable ext3 drivers by default.\n", "Q: Can udev be used (udev rules) to whitelist certain usb devices? Can udev be used (udev rules) to whitelist certain usb devices?\nWhat I mean is that only devices in a list I create (containing device IDs that I can obtain with lsusb) will be passed on / processed by udev. Those not in my list should be ignored by udev as soon as possible (without even notifying the driver for the device).\nI've heard about \"udev rules\". If you know something about how udev rules work, do you think it is possible to use them for my purposes?\nYou may be wondering why I want this. This is for security purposes. See more details here about such vulnerabilities: http://www.charlescurley.com/blog/archives/2011/03/13/linux_usb_vulnerability/index.html\n\nA: A key to writing the proper rules is understanding that udev rules are applied in a certain order.  The default, package-supplied rules are in /lib/udev/rules.d/.  Leave those files alone.  Local rules should be placed in /etc/udev/rules.d/ which takes precedence over /lib/udev/rules.d.\nYour file (if you choose to create a new one) must end in .rules and it can be named as you like, however the numbered files will be processed first.  If you want to override a numbered rules file, choose a higher number for your file name, or choose a file name without a number, it will run after all the numbered rules files.  So the idea is: make your total blacklist rule run first and then the whilelist rules afterwards to allow the specific devices you want to allow.\nIt has already been pointed out however, that this attack requires physical access and such vulnerabilities are usually fixed quickly.  However, what's even more interesting is the fact that if you were using Ubuntu 9.10 and above, you were never really vulnerable to this attack anyway.  Since 9.10 evince's AppArmor profile would have contained the rogue process and limited it to pwning your thumbnails.  See: USN-1035-1: Evince vulnerabilities\n\nA: You need to add rules to /lib/udev/rules.d/ that will whitelist only the given devices, and blacklist all the rest. \nYou can read /lib/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules for examples.\nIt shows how to filter devices and select whether to activate or not the devices.\n\nA: I would not be afraid of this. From the link: \"The vulnerability requires a USB key, so physical access\". Anyone that has physical access can change your root account password, format discs, copy and move files around, leave rootkits, reboot and use a live cd or access a USB stick from RAM during a live cd session. And this type of problem gets fixed rather quickly (the person that found this also made the fix).\nEven so...\nI found a topic on ubuntuforums for doing special udev rules for specifically for usb:  In short (more inside the link):\nCreate the file /etc/udev/rules.d/91-local.rules and copy this into it SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", KERNEL==\"sd??\", ACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/USB %k\" \n%k is the device  the kernel will parse into a script USB that gets executed (sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/USB). \nAnd now you can create a script called USB that can do things based on your conditions, like not mounting it (in the link is a setup for making backups).\n", "Q: What to check before I allow upgrade from my system? I am using Ubuntu 10.10 from last two months, I faced many problems while installing and stabilizing the OS [first tried to normal dual boot, but had to install through wubi]. It cost me three re-installations and loss of some data to stabilize my OS.\nCurrently the upgrade manager constantly shows that an upgrade to 11.04 is available for my system. \nWhat should I check before I go ahead for upgrade? \n\nA: Here are some ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live system: I think the easiest way to check the stability of a new version of Ubuntu is to run it from a live CD or a USB stick. Personally, I would recommend creating a persistent Ubuntu system on a USB stick using Startup Disk Creator. Boot the system, install any drivers, and test any applications you rely on.\n\n*No PPAs: If you want a smooth upgrade, I would recommend against PPAs. If you have enabled some PPAs, uninstall its packages before upgrading your system.\n\n*Backups: Another safe precaution is to make a backup.

For whatever reason I have a bunch of packages listed there.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot, the packages are Open Office packages. I doubt that Open Office became obsolete, or local (whatever that means).\nI am using ubuntu 10.04.\nWhat does \"local or obsolete\" mean in Synaptic, and why do packages become \"local or obsolete\"?\n\nA: These packages were either installed manually (local) or the repository from which it was installed doesn't exist now/doesn't contain the packages anymore (obsolete).\n\nA: From the synaptic help page:\n\nObsolete or locally installed -\n  Display only packages that are not\n  (for longer) included in one of the\n  specified repositories.\n\n\nA: A package is listed under \"local or obsolete\" if synaptic is not able to determine a repository from which the package was (most likely) installed from.\nExplanation: the ubuntu package manager (apt/dpkg) does not keep track of the repository from which a packages was downloaded when it is installed. That means once a package is installed there is no way to tell from where it was downloaded. The package manager can only guess the source repository. It does that by matching the installed package against all available packages in all repositories.\nIf a package with the same name is found in a repository the version number is compared. If the version number in the repository is the same or newer then it is assumed that the package was most likely installed from that repository. If no matching package is found in any repository then synaptic declares the installed package as \"local or obsolete\".\nThere are three situation which can cause an installed package to be not found in any repository:\n\n\n*\n\n*You downloaded and installed the package yourself (dpkg -i foo.deb).\n\n*You installed the package from a repository and later removed that repository (for example a PPA).\n\n*You installed the package from a repository and later the package got removed from that repository (likely to happen in the proposed repository).\n\n\nAbout the term \"local or obsolete\": the first item would be the \"local\" part, while the other two would be the \"obsolete\" part.\n\nSelf answerer reflections:\nIn my case, it seems that the third reason was the cause for the open office packages to be listed under \"local or obsolete\". I had the proposed repository enabled. The open office packages were upgraded in proposed, and later removed from proposed. I wrote more details in the answer to this question: Why are some Open Office packages marked as \"local or obsolete\" in Synaptic.\n\nA: I would add to @nickguletskii nice answer that it is difficult (but not impossible, of course) to obtain the same information on command line using apt-cache and dpkg.\nConversely it is extremely simple with aptitude\naptitude search ~o\n\nIt is a pity that aptitude is not installed by default anymore.\n", "Q: How do I search for a file or directory in Ubuntu Server? It's often that I need to locate the path to files and directories in Ubuntu Server. Are there any good way to search for files or directories in the filesystem by name?\n\nA: The command find / -name \"name-to-search-for\" seem to work fine. A good thing was to add a * in the end or at the beginning of the name.\nE.g. find / -name \"postgresql*\" list files and directories that starts with \"postgresql\".\n\nA: You name it: locate!\nlocate is a program installed by default that let you search for files/dirs by name, into its database updated with a cron job.\nGo through the man page to see other interesting options, like regex search.\nMoreover, you can use find to search on the current content of the filesystem (not on a database), with a full set of complicated options, that let you refine your search also based on metadata (permissions, modification time, etc.).\n\nA: If you are installing and want to know what files you install... you can do that immediately following an install by doing the following:\ntouch marker\nfind <directorypath> -newer marker\n\nThere are some situations in which you will get results other than the newly installed applications(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*if Firefox or another browser is running there may be updated files\n\n*if Virtualbox or other virtualization guest is running its virtual disk file may have been altered.\n\n\nThis method should work with installs from .deb files or scripted installs.\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not use this from the 'root' directory as there are many system files that are updated frequently.\n\nA: According to your comments, you are not looking for specific filenames but for files that belong to a package.\nTo see which files are associated with your installed package just type:\ndpkg -L postgresql-contrib-8.4\n", "Q: Ubuntu One sync seems frozen?

I doubt that Open Office has been dropped from the repositories. So why are Open Office packages marked as \"local or obsolete\" in Synaptic?\n\nI am using Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nUpdate\nI highly doubt that the switch to LibreOffice is the cause for the Open Office packages being marked \"local or obsolete\".\nSeveral reasons:\n\n*\n\n*There are more than just the Open Office packages which are marked \"local or obsolete\". For example: python-uno, scim, and xserver-xorg-input-wacom.\n\n*The ubuntu wiki pages explicitly says that ubuntu 10.04 still uses Open Office. (Link now redirects to another page. Link was: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OfficeApplications/DefaultPackages)\n\n*There are no LibreOffice packages in the Ubuntu 10.04 repositories. As the link above says, one has to use a PPA to get LibreOffice. I am pretty sure Ubuntu will not drop Open Office packages without having replacements in the official repositories.\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 is a LTS (Long Term Support) version. Canonical is very conservative with upgrades on LTS versions. Ubuntu 10.04 even still uses Firefox 3.6.\n\n*Usually, when they do such updates, there is a transitional package which conflicts with the old packages so they get uninstalled. So happened with the old adobe flash plugin package.\n\n\nA: The most likely explanation is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the proposed repository enabled.\n\n*Upgrades for the open office packages were uploaded to the proposed repository.\n\n*You upgraded the open office packages from the proposed repository.\n\n*The proposed upgrades were rejected and subsequently removed from the proposed repository.\n\n*Synaptic can no longer find the open office packages with the same or newer version in any repository and declares the installed packages as \"local or obsolete\".\n\n\nThere is a more detailed explanation about the meaning of \"local or obsolete\" in this question: What does \"local or obsolete\" mean in Synaptic.\nThe proposed repository is a repository for, as the name says, proposed updates. If they are approved then the packages are transfered to another \"stable\" repository and all is good. If they are not approved then they are simply removed from the proposed repository. The transfer and the removal happens silently. There is no notification mechanism (that I know of) which notifies the user of these changes. That means if you have the proposed repository enabled you might get \"local or obsolete\" packages at any time without warning.\nNote that it is not recommended to have the proposed repository enabled on a production system. The Proposed repository is meant for package testers only. I did not know this before and had the proposed repository enabled. I have now disabled the proposed repository after learning about it's purpose and the consequences.\nThere are two methods to \"fix\" the situation. With \"fix\" I mean doing something so the packages are no longer listed under \"local or obsolete\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for the packages to be upgraded again. Hopefully, this time the proposed upgrade will stick.\n\n*Remove the proposed repository and force each package to downgrade to the latest version available in a \"stable\" repository.\n\n\nThe first method is easy. Just wait. But possibly wait forever if the packages are never upgraded again.\nThe second method is not as easy and can be quite troublesome, especially if the package has other packages depending on it. An explanation how to downgrade from proposed is provided in the answers to this question: How can I revert back from an upgrade to the Proposed repository?.\n\nA: You have some local or PPA build of openoffice.org-* installed.  Looking at your screenshot, the version seems to start \"1:3.2.1-6ubuntu1~10.\".  The remainder is not visible.  Did you perhaps enable backports at one point, update openoffice.org, and then disable backports?  Perhaps the same for some PPA that may have contained openoffice.org at some point?\nRegardless of the cause, in order to make this not be marked as \"local or obsolete\", you need to have a current repository configured containing the version of the software you have installed.  The least invasive method is to enable repositories containing the version of the software you are using (although I would expect that you would be upgraded to something based on 1:3.2.1-7ubuntu1 or 1:3.3.0-7ubuntu1 if you are using current backports (whether official or from a PPA)).\nThe more invasive method would be to run commands of the form apt-get install openoffice.org-gtk=1:3.2.0-7ubuntu4.2 for each of the packages (check the current available version to determine which version number to use in the command).  This will probably result in all sorts of error messages until you have performed the operation for each and every package listed, due to the complexity of the dependencies chains in openoffice.org packages.  Note that packages are not guaranteed to downgrade safely: while it is exceedingly likely that the packages will perform as expected after downgrade, in the case that there are problems, please update this question with any error messages that appear specifically related to downgrade, the specific versions you have installed, and the versions you see as available in the hopes that those answering can find out what operations cannot be completed.\n\nA: Ubuntu now ships with LibreOffice as of Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwahl) instead of OpenOffice.\n\nA: Premises:\nUbuntu has switched to LibreOffice suite starting from Natty (11.10).\nAt now LibreOffice is default office application in Ubuntu (OfficeApplications/DefaultPackages).\nYou can find some backgrounds here.\nIf you want to keep support from Ubuntu, you should switch to LibreOffice, even because at now it is compatible with OpenOffice file formats (LibreOffice is a derivative of OpenOffice).\nProposal:\nSince the link you provided proves OpenOffice is maintained in 10.04, I think you should check:\n\n\n*\n\n*That repositories are properly set;\n\n*That openoffice* packages are not from a ppa deactivated/deleted after package installation.\n\n\nIn fact, looking to your screen-shot, it seems newer versions compared to the ones currently in Canonical are installed in your system.\n", "Q: Using Maverick how to upgrade certain packages to newer versions? I tried Natty and was just terrible, even Gnome Classic was buggy. So I switched back to 10.10 and all is well.\nHowever, I miss the newer versions of Rhythmbox, Empathy, Gwibber, etc that are in Natty's repo... is there any way to upgrade only those packages?  I don't want to add the natty repos because I fear it will constantly bug me about upgrading everything else...\nthanks!\n\nA: The only recommended way to upgrade default applications provided with Ubuntu is through backports. To enable the backports repository, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open 'Ubuntu Software Centre'\n\n*Click on the 'Edit' menu item, then 'Software Sources'.\n\n*Enter your password if prompted.\n\n*In the dialog that has just opened, click on the tab labelled 'Updates'.\n\n*Tick the item labelled 'Unsupported updates (maverick-backports)', and click 'Close'.\n\n\nOnce you've done this, new unsupported major updates will be provided along with the usual security and recommended updates in Update Manager.\nIf the backports repository doesn't provide the new versions of software you want, you can search online for PPAs. Bear in mind that PPAs are usually intended for testing purposes only.\nSupporting new applications with new system requirements and package dependencies is very difficult without upgrading the system itself. This is why Ubuntu has chosen to only release new major versions of software when the underlying system has been tested and upgraded.\nFor more details about PPAs, see this question:\nWhat are PPAs and how do I use them?\n", "Q: Why does Banshee recognize my Android on Ubuntu, but not on Mythbuntu?

I am using KPackageKit to maintain my system, and I am trying to keep all pack up to date (but I didn't enable any experimental or beta repositories).\nIn my opinion such setup should not break anything, but that doesn't seams to be the case. Two weeks ago after an update, the flash player stopped working. After another update, something else.\nSo, the question : how to know when to update the packages, but not to break anything?\nEven if something broken gets in, is there a way to revert changes?\n\nA: You should install the updates as soon as it appears. Updated are tested before released to the public. These unreleased updates are called proposed updates. Sometimes an update breaks something, this is called a regression. These regressions are rare due to the testing before, but that does not lower the chance of breaking a package completely.\nIn the case of Flash, the installer does sometimes not work. I noticed that an upgrade of flashplugin-installer using KPackageKit sometimes removes Flash without installing the  new version. The solution was re-installing it, for which I prefer the terminal so I can see any error messages:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-installer\n\nNote that this installer is special, due to licensing, the Flash libraries cannot be distributed in the package and therefore the package downloads Flash from archive.canonical.com.\nAs with other packages, it's likely a bug of the regression type as mentioned before. Most packages have a bug tracker on Launchpad.net, a solution could be available as well. Regressions are often quickly fixed.\nTo \"revert\" an update, you need to know what version the previously installed package was. /var/log/apt/history.log contains changes to packages including their versions.\nI hacked a bash command together, you have to execute it and enter package name. Then a list of previous versions is displayed. It could be done cleaner with awk, but I've yet to learn that :D\noIFS=\"$IFS\";IFS=$',\\n';read -p 'Package name: ' package;for w in $(grep \"^Upgrade: \" /var/log/apt/history.log | cut -c9-);do [[ ${w/:*/} == \\ $package ]] && echo \"$w\" | cut -d\"(\" -f2; done;IFS=\"$oIFS\"\n\nAfter you've determined the old version, you must run the next command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install packagename=version\n\nTo downgrade firefox to version 4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1, you have to run:\nsudo apt-get install firefox=4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1\n\n", "Q: Any plans to add a Win7-Style \"Preview Pane\" for previewing files in Nautilus? One feature I enjoy in Windows 7 is the Windows Explorer's Preview Pane. Will something similar be added to Nautilus for Ubuntu at some point in the future?\n\nA: It is possible to combine the Gloobus Preview interface with Nautilus i.e. so that you retain any new bug fixes for Nautilus through the repositories but also have the ability to preview files.\nIn summary, pressing the spacebar on a supported file (e.g. text, pdf, mp3 etc) in Nautilus will present a preview like this for a PDF:\n\nand like this for a MP3:\n\nIf you want to try this suggest use the following packages:\nDownload and install Gloobus Preview from the PPA here\nThen download the Nautilus extension script from here\nInstall a small addition for nautilus\nsudo apt-get install python-nautilus\n\nThen extract the Nautilus extension script you have downloaded.\nInstall the script using\ncd <folder containing the extracted extension script>\nsudo python setup.py install --install-layout=deb\n\nLogout and log back in.\n\nA: Gloobus preview\nGloobus preview might be the tool you are looking for. I think it is the thing which is included in nautilus elementary, but it can be installed separatly too. For instructions on installation, look here.\n\nA: Nautilus elementary does a preview of images like this:\n\nThe Gloobus project intends to have preview for all sorts of files but they are still developing I think. \n\nA: Try nautilus-elementary, now available on Natty:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/03/phew-nautilus-elementary-revived-in-time-for-ubuntu-natty/\n", "Q: Window borders disappear I have a new install of Ubuntu 11.04 and sometimes the window borders will disappear. How do I prevent this or at least get them back without logging out and logging back in (which means close all my programs)?\nI have installed WINE but it is not running, but seems to make it happen more often I think when it is running, probably just cause of the exe I am running.\nI probably have an out of date Ubuntu because I have no internet and I think Ubuntu comes out of date when you get the ISO, but if there was a patch I needed, I can install it.\n\nA: From a command line, run :\ncompiz-decorator --replace\n\n\nA: I had something similar where compiz and metacity where not working well together.\ntry compiz --replace & \nI had to stop doing it after updating though.\n\nA: ubuntu 11.04 used new kernel and has some bugs.

I am having a weird problem with Eclipse documentation tooltips. When I startup Eclipse the tooltip works as expected:\n\nBut after I press the down button the tooltip turns black:\n\nand stays like that for the rest of the session.\nI am using Eclipse Galileo and Ubuntu 11.04 with the classic desktop.\nEDIT:  I am only experiencing this problem in PHP Development Tools.

I had to restart eclipse.\n\nA: The answer listed here finally worked for me after trying several other solutions, none of which worked (Eclipse Mars 4.5.2, Ubuntu 14.04.3). I did have to edit one additional file though (gtk-main.css).\nIf you run the \"Ambiance\" theme (default theme, dark), open these files and change all \"bg\" tooltip colors to #ffffff (white) and all \"fg\" tooltip colors to #000000 (black):\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nSo e.g. run:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nIf you run the \"Radiance\" theme (the light theme), you need to edit these files:\n/usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini\n/usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css\n/usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css\n/usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\nSo e.g. run:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini /usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/gtk.css /usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-3.0/gtk-main.css /usr/share/themes/Radiance/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\n\n\nA: I found a way to fix Eclipse tooltip color without falling back to GTK2 and without affecting any other application.\nThe fix is captured in a script and it can be accessed here.\nhttps://github.com/KiranMohan/eclipse-gtk3-ubuntu\nThe script makes a copy of the Ambiance theme, modifies the tooltip color and then writes a launcher for eclipse with this new Theme.\n\nA: I managed to solve this in Oxygen by going to windows->preferences->general->appearance->Colors and Fonts then in the window provided find Javadoc background (overrides default) - changing the color to anything that is not black.\n", "Q: I keep getting a syntax error when trying to install Bumblebee I'm getting a syntax error when trying to install Bumblebee (Hardware graphics switcher).

Compiz calls it the Super key. freedesktop.org uses Win and Super interchangeably. GNOME ambiguously calls it Meta, Super, or an OS-logo shift key.\nWhat should I call it when teaching others about Ubuntu?\n\nA: For most users that's the Windows key since the popularity given by Microsoft after Windows 95 became a mainspread OS (look at this Wikipedia article).\nFor beginners keep calling it the Windows key but explain them that there are also another widespread name in Ubuntu for that key and it's the Super key, with this they become familiar with the terms.\nIn the other hand, for advanced users just use the terminology of Super key since they might already know that key with that name.\nIn that way all the new people getting into the Ubuntu world will became familiar with the terms of the shortcuts used in Unity and in other software and also it's easy for them to understand.\n\nA: I would just call it the logo key. That way, people with a (possibly former) Windows computer look for a Windows logo. And the people with a laptop from something like Zareason or System76 that have an Ubuntu logo can still use that name, and when Ubuntu takes over the world we won't have to change the name.\n", "Q: Converting panasonic .MTS video into high quality mpeg videos? I have been using WinFF tool to convert panasonic default .MTS videos into mpeg videos. However, I am not happy with the quality of the mpeg video output. Could some one tell me if there are any other tool for Ubuntu or the options that should I use in WinFF for getting high quality mpeg output. \n\nA: This site has a great tutorial on how to do it, and includes a helpful bash script that joins the MTS files before starting, as apparently not doing so can cause problems.\nIf you want to experiment before jumping into his instructions, you can try the following command.

So I went into the compiz settings and thinking that turning off unity might restore the old look I did that and now I have no panels or dock.  This cut me off from any way I could think of to fix the problem(I can't quite remember but I must have closed the compiz window for some reason).\nSo I rebooted and logged back in with Ubuntu Classic, this was closer to what I wanted but I wanted my spinning cube back, so again I played with the compiz settings.  This time I just checked the rotating cube, let the extra needed changes happen, and the frames around all my windows disappeared!  Playing with the settings didn't bring them back so I did some googling but the only solution I found was to type \"metacity --replace\" into a terminal, but this only works as long as I keep the terminal open.\nSo I logged out and logged back in with Ubuntu Classic No Effects and came here.  Basically, I want to turn compiz back on in regular Ubuntu and/or get my frames back in Classic Ubuntu, or just reset everything.\n\nA: To get your window titles and frames back, open your terminal and type this:\ncompiz-decorator --replace\n\n\nA: Run compizconfig, and under effects check windows decoration. This will essentially run compiz-decorator. When disabling unity this settings also gets disabled. When you enable unity this setting does not get enabled.\n\nA: I have same problems.  I installed Compiz Fusion Icon from software centre.  It installs on the panel, and there you can change the window manager permanetly to metaticity.\n", "Q: Disable sudo permission to user from command line I have activated root user in ubuntu and want to use ubuntu as server with no DE. For this I want to disable sudo privilege given to first user. How can I do this from command line ? I know I can use a GUI but how to do it from command line ? \n\nA: Whatever wisdom may be found in the above answers, I've solved the issue of enabling the root account and disabling sudo for a specified user as follows.\nFirst enable the root account:\n$ sudo passwd root\n\nMore information in the Ubuntu Documentation.\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*become root\n\n*backup and then edit /etc/group\n\n*become user again to test the changes\n\n\nThat is:\n$ su\n# cp /etc/group /etc/group.bak\n# nano /etc/group               # find a line like 'sudo:x:27:guest', remove the\n                                # user name (i.c. 'guest') and save the file\n# exit,\n$ [try any sudo command]\n\nThe user 'guest' is now removed from the sudoers file. If all went well any sudo command should return a message the like of this:\nguest is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nA guest logging in on this computer can no longer accidentally or willingly mess with the system, since you need to be root to do so. Of course, if you add a new user, you will need to repeat the editing of /etc/group.\nCheers!\n-- \nlinuxrev\n(Ubuntu 12.04)\n\nA: The user in question has sudo privileges because it is in the admin group.  As wojox commented, you could use visudo and remove sudo privileges from the admin group, but that would remove sudo capabilities from all members of the admin group not just the one user.\nAlternatively, you can remove the user from the admin group.  If screen oriented vi is considered command line enough, run vigr and delete the username from the appropriate line.  \nFor a \"pure\" command line solution, try gpasswd, as it administers /etc/group and can add and delete users from groups.\nroot@toki:~# id -Gn username\nusername adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare\n                                         # ^- the group to remove\nroot@toki:~# gpasswd -d username admin\nRemoving user username from group admin\n\nroot@toki:~# id -Gn username\nusername adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n                                        # ^- username not a member\nroot@toki:~# gpasswd -a username admin\nAdding user username to group admin\nroot@toki:~# id -Gn username\nusername adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare\n\nBelow is my first answer before I realized there was a less dumb way to do it.\nIf you'd like a more complicated way to do this, you can use usermod.\nHere's a quote from the usermod man page:\n-G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]\n    A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.\n    Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening\n    whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the\n    group given with the -g option.\n\n    If the user is currently a member of a group which is not listed, the\n    user will be removed from the group. This behaviour can be changed via\n    the -a option, which appends the user to the current supplementary group\n    list.\n\nSo you have to specify all the groups for the user except for admin.\nroot@toki:~# id username\nuid=1000(username) gid=1000(username) groups=1000(username),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),46(plugdev),111(lpadmin),119(admin),122(sambashare)\n\nroot@toki:~# usermod -G 4,20,24,46,111,122 username\n\nroot@toki:~# id username\nuid=1000(username) gid=1000(username) groups=1000(username),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),46(plugdev),111(lpadmin),122(sambashare)\n\nFinally, it violates the spirit of the question, but one could type users-admin from the command line to modify users and groups.\n\nA: Warning\nCarefull, you can lock yourself out of our system this way! Always make sure, that the root-user retains his rights and you can access it. Keep a root terminal open beforehand so you can undo changes. Test settings in another terminal before closing your root-terminal!\nsoduers\nAs described in another answer. Edit /etc/sudoers by invoking visudo in shell:\nsudo select-editor # this is optional. it will allow you to select your default editor in shell\nsudo visudo\n\nThen change the line that says something similar to this:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nto this:\n# root may gain root privileges\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nOr delete the line, if you're sure, your root user account is enabled.\ngroup\nThe default user is member of the 'admin' group. If you preferre it, you could just as well revoke the users membership to that group. Do that by following my last link or remove his name from the line admin:x:120:defaultuser in /etc/group file:\ncp -n /etc/group /etc/group.bak && \\\nsed -i 's/\\(admin:x.*\\)defaultuser\\(.*\\)/\\1\\2/g' /etc/group\n\n", "Q: Desktop installation never gets to the graphical stage with a GMA500 I am trying to install ubuntu desktop on a hardware-set, which on a similar one, I have successfully installed ubuntu server with no issues.\nWhen booting from Ubuntu Desktop CD it ends up at the ubuntu@ubuntu $ after failing to display the graphical installation interface.\nThe graphic card is Intel SCG GMA500 Video Controller\nThe display is *5\" screen 800*480 LCD*\nI am seeing the line Not using built-in mode \"640x480\" (no mode of this name) and wonder where can I define my own custom screen resolution in order to move forward.\nAnd wonder whether this is the only thing I will have to do\nBelow is the output of the Xorg.0.log file\n[   333.311] \nX.Org X Server 1.10.1\nRelease Date: 2011-04-15\n[   333.311] X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\n[   333.311] Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.24-29-server i686 Ubuntu\n[   333.311] Current Operating System: Linux ubuntu 2.6.38-8-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11 03:31:50 UTC 2011 i686\n[   333.312] Kernel command line: file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash -- maybe-ubiquity\n[   333.312] Build Date: 19 April 2011  03:33:17PM\n[   333.312] xorg-server 2:1.10.1-1ubuntu1 (For technical support please see http://www.ubuntu.com/support) \n[   333.312] Current version of pixman: 0.20.2\n[   333.312]    Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n    to make sure that you have the latest version.\n[   333.312] Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[   333.313] (==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Wed May 25 03:48:00 2011\n[   333.315] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n[   333.316] (==) No Layout section.

You can see if you've got it right by typing X from the terminal, and if you end up with a screen with black and white lines you've got it sorted.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Googling over this, there seemed to be many issues with Linux/Ubuntu and this chipset (Intel SCG GMA500).\nThe only solution which worked for by far me was to install JoliOS\nWhich comes with drivers for GMA and then, from a terminal, install Ubuntu desktop, and remove the Joli's redundant components\nUPDATE: Older Ubuntu, 9.04 works fine as well out of the box\n", "Q: Dual Boot Ubuntu 11.04 / Vista 32 with a RAID 0 I tried to install Ubuntu 11.04 several time using all the informations I could gather on the web.

When I try to select another destination (the one that seems to correspond to the Ubuntu partition according to gParted) is does nothing, and if I try to continue without Grub (I could install it later) a box with the following message appears:\n\nWe're sorry; the installer crashed...\n\nI tried to install it on the RAID0 40Go partition, and later onto the HD3 40Go partition but both of them return the Grub error, and in the both cases I can't finalize the Ubuntu installation even without Grub.\n\nSome informations\n\n\n*\n\n*I use a USB key to boot and install Ubuntu (and it boots without problem).\n\n*The live session of Ubuntu start without any problem on the same computer.\n\n*I was able to install and run the same ISO on virtual box on the same computer.\n\n*The error occurs at almost 80-85% of the installation.\n\n\nAnd finally, here are the informations returned by the Boot Info Script after cleaning the both 40Go partitions.\n              Boot Info Script 0.60    from 17 May 2011\n\n\n    ============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n     => Syslinux MBR (3.61-4.03) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb.\n     => Windows is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdd.\n     => HP/Gateway is installed in the MBR of /dev/mapper/nvidia_dffbicaa.\n\n    sdb1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n        File system:       vfat\n        Boot sector type:  SYSLINUX 4.03 2010-10-22 ........>..sr>..........:...0...~.....~...f...M.f.f....f..0~....>E}.u......\n        Boot sector info:   Syslinux looks at sector 32144 of /dev/sdb1 for its \n                   second stage.

The only choice available from the menu is Advanced Options / Rescue Broken System. Neither Run Ubuntu from this USB (probably normal) nor Install Ubuntu on a Hard Disk (is this normal ??) are available.\nSo I tried Rescue Broken System, and everything seems ok until the \"Detect disks\" step.\nIt is asked the device to use as root file system and the choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/dm-1\n\n*/dev/dm-2\n\n*/dev/dm-3\n\n*/dev/dm-4\n\n*/dev/dm-5\n\n*/dev/sdc1\n\n*Assemble RAID array\n\n*Do not use a root file system\n\n\nI tried with dm-4 and I was able to install GRUB and to finish the installation.\nUnfortunately, after rebooting, I went to Vista without any menu to book on Ubuntu.\nSince that when I retry the Rescue Broken System, and when I select dm-4 as root file system, it offers me to Reinstall GRUB boot loader (which produce an error) and to execute shells, but I'm unable to continue to next step (Partition disks)\nDoes anything seems strange in this ?\n\nEdit 2:\nI finally managed to make GRUB work by reinstalling it on the /dev/mapper/nvidia_dffbicaa (known with the command # sudo dmraid -s).\nWhen I boot on Vista it does work without any problem (pfuuu) but when I try to book the Ubuntu ou the Recovery Ubuntu, it fails.\nShould I try to reinstall using the normal Ubuntu ISO (non Alternate) over this working Grub ?   \n\nEdit 3:\nOk the problem is solved. Here is how a achieved to do it.\n1 - Cleaning of the 40Go partition\n2 - Boot on Ubuntu Alternate Recovery Mode, and use of the main menu (ESC) to create the partitions (swap and ext4) and assemble the raid, then setup Grub using the RAID name (/dev/mapper/theRaidName) instead of /dev/sda.\n3 - Boot on Ubuntu Normal, then proceeding to install normally until the Grub error...\n4 - Reboot and all is there.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that you need to use the Alternate CD if you are going to install Ubuntu into a RAID condition.  The installer is text based, but has more capabilities than the one found on the live CD image, or USB key image.\nPlease read the documentation here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\nbertmanphx\n", "Q: Force full-screen game to one monitor? I have two monitors, one 1920x1200 and the other 1920x1080, and in 10.10 they were \"separate\". As in when I opened the display preferences they were shown as separate screens. Since installing (from scratch) 11.04 I instead have one giant 3840x1200 screen spread over the two monitors. Not a problem per se, except when I want to play full-screen games! When playing games I want them to be on the primary (1920x1200) monitor, but since the game only detects one screen I cant do that, even if I lower the resolution in-game.\nI have a nVidia GTS 250 card, using nvidia-current driver (version 270.41.06), even though \"Additional Drivers\" reports the driver is \"activated  but not currently in use\".\nIs there a way to force the game to use only one of the monitors? Or make the game detect both monitors?\n\nA: Yes there is. You need to wirte a second metamode into your /etc/X11/xorg.config. For me it looks like this:\n # excerpt from /etc/X11/xorg.config\n Section \"Screen\"\n     Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n     Device         \"Device0\"\n     Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n     DefaultDepth    24\n     Option         \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n     Option         \"TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n     Option         \"metamodes\" \"CRT: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0;1024x786,NULL;NULL,1680x1050\"\n     SubSection     \"Display\"\n         Depth       24\n     EndSubSection\n EndSection\n\nI have an old LCD-monitor connected to my laptop. The LCD is called 'CRT' in xorg.config has a resolution of 1024x768. The laptop screen called 'DFP' in the file with resolution 1680x1050.\nIn my xorg.config you will find three metamodes (line Option \"metamodes\" \"CRT: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0; 1024x786, NULL; NULL, 1680x1050\") devided by semicolons: \n\n\n*\n\n*CRT: nvidia-auto-select +1680+0, DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0; uses both monitors in auto select mode. \n\n*When a resolution of 1680x1050 (i.e. of my laptop screen is requested) the metamode NULL,1680x1050; deactivates the old CRT and sets the laptop screen resolution to that value.\n\n*Vice versa, when 1024x786 is needed 1024x786,NULL; deactivates the laptop screen and sets CRT to that resolution.\n\n\nNow you just have to add similar entries. Finding out which display is called what will help. Then you have to set your game to use the resolution specified in the additional metamode. That should do the trick.\n", "Q: Kate switches to RTL input and I can't get back to LTR This has happened a couple of times (also to my boss) - but once in a long while, Kate will just switch over to right-to-left input.\nWe've searched for the menu command or keyboard combination that triggers this so that we can return to left-to-right input, but we've pretty much had to resort to restarting Kate.\nWhat is the command for this switchover?\n\nA: I think you are getting bitten by this bug.\nSome observations from the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems to be not triggered by a shortcut.\n\n*It might not be a bug in Kate, but a bug in some Qt component.\n\n*It seems to not switch from LTR to RTL, instead it messes up the cursor position.\n\n*A workaround seems to be saving, then reloading the document (keyboard shortcut: F5).\n\n", "Q: External monitors don't go into standby if laptop lid is closed I use a docking station with 2 external monitors and keep my laptop lid closed when docked. \nIn Gnome's power settings, I have set \"Do nothing\" when laptop lid is closed and this works fine (after adding the option manually through gconf-editor). However, when the screens are set to go to standby, they actually just blank, rather than changing their DPMS mode. This wastes electricity. \nIf the laptop lid is open, the monitors go to standby as expected. Things also work correctly when not logged in (in GDM) so I think it must have something to do with Gnome. \nAny pointers? \n\nA: Same problem here, VGA output to external monitor.

Now i love the plasma-netbook aka the \"search and launch\" interface but i would want to be able to have it appear on demand and not sit as the desktop default in the back of my windows.\nSo what i imagine is having a application launcher be created which on activation brings up the \"search and launch\" feature allowing for easy access of your favorites or have that slick interface to find what your looking for. I'm aware that krunner solves a similar use-case but search and launch would be more of an Unity Dash type of search, whereas krunner is more useful when u exactly know what your looking for.\nAnd to summarize my question, since I'm clueless as to how this would be done, I'm lookinf for someone who could tell me how hard it would be to do it.\n\nA: I think i may have found the best possible alternative to my search. Its this new plasmoid called \"Takeoff\". It's not really the netbook interface but i must say I'm pretty pleased with its 1st release.\n\nA: You may create a new activity and set its desktop layout as \"search and launch\".\nYou can quickly switch between activities using a keyboard shortcut(default Meta+Tab) or using the \"Activity Bar\" widget. \nIf you want to read more about Plasma Activities, visit http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=93183 .\n", "Q: Evolution has lost all email data after upgrade to 11.04, is there a way to recover the data?

With KMS enabled on Xubuntu 11.04, my virtual terminals are running at 60hz, the default for my monitor, while my X desktop is running at 75, the refresh rate I specified in my xorg.conf. How do I set the refresh rate/mode used by KMS so that it is something different from the default mode provided by my monitor?\n\nA: You can specify the resolution/refresh rate that the VT framebuffers will use on the kernel command line¹.  \nTo do so, you want to add\nvideo=<xres>x<yres>@<refresh>\n\nto your kernel command line.  So, for example\nvideo=1024x768@75\n\nwould give you a 1024x768 framebuffer at 75Hz.  The @<refresh> bit is optional.\nYou can edit your kernel command line on a one-time basis by hitting e from the grub menu, or to set it permanently you can edit /etc/default/grub, adding it to the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nlike so:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash video=1024x768@75\"\n\nAfter editing /etc/default/grub you'll need to run sudo update-grub to propagate the configuration to your boot settings.\nDocumentation/fb/modedb.txt has the full specification of what options you can pass in to video= - if you have unusual requirements (interlaced, reduced-blanking, etc) see this documentation.\n¹: This is due in part to the fact that there's no good way to notify VT users of resolution changes.\n", "Q: How to control internet access for each program? I would like to use a software to control which program may connect to the internet. I know that this behaviour is associated with the word \"firewall\", but some Linux users are very upset if somebody demands a Personal Firewall. I don't want to upset you by demand such a program.\nI don't want to \"secure ports\" or other stuff a Personal Firewall promises on Windows. I looked into iptables but it does not fit my requirements.\nI saw an excellent answer here (\"How to block internet access for wine applications\") but it's very uncomfortable to set this up.\nIs there a software that asks for each program if it may access the internet?\n\nA: There is a Perl script in the German Ubuntu forum (Google-translated to English) that seems to do that. I never tried it and I didn't take a closer look at the script, but maybe it works for you. The description is in German only so you may need a translation service (like Google Translate; see above).  \n\nA: Running a program under another user will use the config files for that user and not yours.\nHere is a solution that does not require modifying the firewall rules, and runs under the same user (via sudo) with a modified environment, where your user is my_user and the app you want to run is my_app:\n# run app without access to internet\nsudo unshare -n sudo -u my_user my_app\n\nFor more details see man unshare and this answer.\nLinux GUI firewall\nIf you are looking for a GUI firewall I've had good results with OpenSnitch — it's not yet in ubuntu repos and I wouldn't call it production-level, but following the build steps from the github page worked for me.\n\nA: There is already a firewall in Ubuntu, ufw, but it is disabled by default. You can enable and use it by the command line or its frontend, gufw, that is installable directly from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\nIf you need to block the internet access to a specific application, you can try LeopardFlower, which is still in beta version and it is not available in the Ubuntu Software Centre:\n\nA: I found a convenient solution that solves the problem. You create a group that is never allowed to use the internet and start the program as a member of this group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a group no-internet.

It involves creating a user-group for which internet access is allowed, and setting up firewall rules to allow access only for this group.  The only way for an application to access the internet is if it is run by a member of this group.  You can run programs under this group by opening a shell with sudo -g internet -s.\nTo recap what's in the post I linked above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the \"internet\" group by typing the following into a shell: sudo groupadd internet\n\n*Ensure that the user who will run the script below is added to the sudo group in /etc/group.  If you end up modifying this file, then you will need to log out and back in before the script below will work.\n\n*Create a script containing the following, and run it:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Firewall apps - only allow apps run from \"internet\" group to run\n\n# clear previous rules\nsudo iptables -F\n\n# accept packets for internet group\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --gid-owner internet -j ACCEPT\n\n# also allow local connections\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 192.168.0.1/24 -j ACCEPT\n\n# reject packets for other users\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REJECT\n\n# open a shell with internet access\nsudo -g internet -s\n\n\n*By running the above script, you will have a shell in which you can run applications with internet access.\nNote that this script doesn't do anything to save and restore your firewall rules.  You may wish to modify the script to use the iptables-save and iptables-restore shell commands.\n\nA: Another option is firejail. It runs the application inside sandbox where you control if the application could see the network:\nfirejail --net=none firefox\n\nThis command will start Firefox browser without internet access.\nNote that the firejail distribution in the Ubuntu repo is outdated - better download its latest LTS version from the firejail home page.\n\nA: Try Leopard Flower. It has a GUI and per-application restrictions.\n\nA: For better or worse, Linux uses a different approach. There is no simple graphical interface to offer this functionality. There are many discussions on this topic on the internet and you can find interesting discussions if you google search. While debate is interesting, to date there has not been a dedicated group of programmers wanting to write and maintain this functionality.\nThe tools that offer this functionality in Linux are Apparmor, Selinux, and Tomoyo.\nNone of these tools are overly easy to learn and all have advantages and disadvantages. Personally I prefer SELinux, although SELinux has a steeper learning curve.\nSee:\nhttp://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/12/06/3-application-level-firewalls-for-linux-distributions/\nThere was (is) an application that has been referenced already, leopardflower. I am not sure of the status / maintance.\n\nA: It was in iptables up to kernel version 2.6.24\nIf you are running a 2.x - 2.6.24 machine and your kernel has it complied in you can do it. \nfor some reason they took it out, so no its not microsoft. \nhttp://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER.html\n\nA: No, it isn't possible.  It also isn't part of the traditional definition of a firewall.  It is something that Microsoft came up with fairly recently in an attempt to paper around their fundamentally broken OS security problems.  It is considered foolhardy and unworkable in the Linux community because one program that isn't allowed can simply run another program that is and gain access that way.\nIf you don't like what a program is doing on the network when you run it, then don't run that program.\n", "Q: How do I route my internet through a SSH tunnel? Old Q How do I setup an OpenVPN server without root privileges?\nIs there a way to setup an OpenVPN server without root privileges? E.g. with configuration files in my home directory? If yes, how do I set it up?\nI'm trying to SSH into a system and set up an OpenVPN server over there for personal use.\nEDIT\nSince it's apparent that OpenVPN needs root privileges, I am changing the question to routing my internet using SSH which I can easily set up.\n\nA: sshuttle is a transparent proxy server that forwards over a SSH connection and sets up a proxy by running Python scripts on the remote server. sshuttle can be run under the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*client machine or router is Linux-based, FreeBSD or Mac OS\n\n*administrative privileges on client\n\n*access to remote network via SSH\n\n*no administrator privileges on remote network\n\n*availability of Python on remote server\n\n\nInstall sshuttle  from the Software Center or the Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install sshuttle\n\nThe basic command for running sshuttle with routing all traffic is:\nsshuttle -r username@sshserver:port 0/0\n\nUpon the execution of the command, a sudo password prompt will appear and subsequently the password to SSH account. No other details will appear except for a short message and return to shell upon failure. For more status messages, run sshuttle in verbose mode with the -v flag.\nIn this example all internet traffic except DNS is routed through the VPN. -r flag denotes the remote hostname and optional username and port that follows in the above example. 0/0 is short for 0.0.0.0/0 that represents the subnets to route over the VPN. The usage of 0/0 routes all the traffic except DNS requests to the remote server. DNS tunelling is possible with the usage of -H flag.\nPlease read the man page (man sshuttle) for the details of options and modes under which sshuttle can run. For information about the concept and more examples, refer to the project page.\n\nA: You cannot setup OpenVPN without root privileges because certain operations requires it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prerequisites: you need to enable packet forwarding in your (iptables?) firewall\n\n*Adding devices in operation: a special virtual device has to be added using ifconfig. Otherwise, no communication is possible between the server and client\n\n\nDepending on your needs, other solutions are available. For browsing through your server, you may set up a SOCKS server.\nSOCKS proxy\nSetting up a SOCKS proxy is not difficult: it's built-in in OpenSSH. To enable the SOCKS server, run the next command in a terminal:\nssh user@host -D1234\n\nReplace 1234 by your preferred port. In your browser, you can enter localhost as host and 1234 as port at SOCKS4/5 server.\nBelow is an example in the Firefox browser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit -> Preferences\n\n*Open the Advanced section\n\n*Go to the Network tab\n\n*Press Settings\n\n*Select Manual proxy configuration\n\n*Enter localhost as SOCKS Host\n\n*Enter 1234 as port (the same port as specified in the SSH command)\n\n*Press OK and Close to close the preferences dialogs.\n\n\n\n\nA: If you only want to tunnel your systems TCP traffic i recommend to use a programm called tun2socks.\nIf you also want to tunnel UDP traffic you have to install udpgw on your server.\nHere is an tutorial how to install and use this programms: http://board.nwrk.biz/viewtopic.php?id=3\n", "Q: \"Disk driver for / is not ready yet or not present\" error after upgrade I tried to upgrade my Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04.

First enter a name for the launcher and type: gnome-panel in the Command field (You can add a comment if you want). When done cllick on the OK button and the launcher will be shown on your desktop.\nOr you can add the command line to the startup list press Alt+F2 and type:\ngnome-session-properties\n\nYour Startup Applications Preferences manager will open now click on the Add button, enter a name and type: gnome-panel in the Command field. Add a comment if you want and click on the OK button. Now the gnome panel will enabled automatically at startup. When using this option the top gnome panel will NOT be shown because the Unity top panel overlaps it. \n\nA: It is not currently possible to have more than one Unity launcher.\nHowever, you can use a dock, which is similar to the launcher.

Remember, a virtual guest does not have to rely on the underlying host hardware.  Therefore, to the virtual Ubuntu, it thinks it is seeing a fixed ethernet cable connection.\nThe default for VirtualBox is to provide a virtual network capability, which connects the networking traffic from one device to another.  \nN.B. this shouldnt be confused with the Windows Bridging Network Adapter which is another thing entirely.\nBy default, the active Host network (your windows wireless in your case) is linked to the virtual hardware device through what is termed Network Addressed Translation (NAT).  This is just a capability to allow two devices (in this case Windows and the Virtual Ubuntu) to share the same IP address.\nThus, assuming that your windows networking is correctly setup and you've haven't fiddled too much with the virtual box ubuntu guest settings, your virtual Ubuntu guest will use your Windows wireless network without any further tweaks. \n", "Q: Unable to mount audio disk (DBus error) I'm not able to play audio CDs on my Lenovo x301.

The TrueCrypt Boot Loader appears,asks for password and redirects me to GRUB. I also tried booting from the TrueCrypt Rescue CD, but with no luck.\n\nA: I fixed the above issue and now I have what I want. The issue was caused because I gave my /boot partition the \"boot\" flag. After giving the \"boot\" flag back to the encrypted Win7 partition, everything worked as intended by the developers.\nHere are my exact steps, if anyone wants to create a similar setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 4 partitions with GParted (500GB Hard Drive)\n\n*\n\n*100GB NTFS - Windows - Must have the \"boot\" flag\n\n*1GB   ext4 - /boot\n\n*50GB  empty - Kubuntu, LVM inside encrypted partition\n\n*349GB NTFS - SHARED\n\n\n*Install Windows 7 to the first partition\n\n*Encrypt the system partition with TrueCrypt, burn the Recovery Disk(not needed,but good for recovery)\n\n*Install Kubuntu 11.04 from ALTERNATE CD/ or Desktop DVD(Text Mode)\n\n*\n\n*Make an encrypted volume in the 50GB partition.\n\n*Setup a LVM in the encrypted volume.\n\n*Make 2 logical volumes inside a logical group - 2/4GB swap, and remaining for /\n\n*Set the 1GB partition as /boot, DO NOT GIVE IT the \"boot\" flag\n\n*Install GRUB to /boot partition (/dev/sda2 in this case) DO NOT OVERWRITE the MBR.\n\n\n*When installation is done, restart the computer\n\n*On boot, TrueCrypt bootloader will load, enter password to boot into Windows.\n\n*Press Esc and the GRUB menu will be shown, passphrase will be required to unlock the Kubuntu partition.\n\n\nTo mount the SHARED partition:\nIn Windows: Open TrueCrypt as Administrator and add the SHARED partition as a \"System Favorite\" - the partition must use the same password as the Windows partition.\nThis will auto-mount the partition on Windows start-up FOR ALL USERS!!!\nIn Kubuntu: Open TrueCrypt and mount the SHARED partition. It will appear under /media/truecrypt* where * is the slot number in TrueCrypt. I am using NTFS for my SHARED partition and it works just fine under Kubuntu.\nI hope this is helpful to someone...\n", "Q: Where are these Unity close, minimize and maximize icons located?

I would like to learn how to determine the file name of the .png file used for a launcher, but have been unable to find a way to do it.\nThanks-\ntom\n\nA: Hit super and start typing main menu until it shows up. Click it and you will see your menu. I will take deluge as an example. This is the icon it shows in the launcher:\n\nOne way of finding it is:\n\nChoose properties and you will see:\n\nClick the icon and it will show the directory of the icon at the top:\n\nSo it is in /usr/share/icons/Faenza-dark/apps/48. In there are several directories with sizes and in there are the icons for said size. Your should be able to find the exact name of any icon in the menu. \nThe launcher for deluge sits in /usr/share/applications/ and is called deluge.desktop. When I open it with gedit (gedit /usr/share/applications/deluge.desktop) you will see 1 of the lines stating what the name of the icon is: Icon=deluge. I assume all of these icons are png(?) \nSo now we know the name but not the location on the disc but we can use locate on command line for that. This is a list of all deluge.png files on my system (basically all the themes and all the sizes):\n\nIf you want to find all icons in any of the launchers you can do that command line too:\ncd /usr/share/applications\ngrep -R Icon= *desktop | more\nand you will get this:\n\nPages and pages of icon names! \n\nA: The best way is going to /usr/share/applications on Nautilus (or your favourite file browser). Then open gedit as root.\nSelect any .desktop file and drag it to gedit (obviously you can open it in several different ways, but I this is specially quick for me). You will see the .desktop file content, the interesting thing it that:\nIcon=someapp\n\nIf the icon name is only «someapp» and it doesn't specify any special location, it will use your selected icon theme; this is great, because it will use all sizes.\nYou can type add an extension format so that it will only use this format, but in all sizes. \nIf you specify the path, it will only use that specific icon and only its size, e.g, Icon=/home/user/niceicons/cuteicon.png: if the icon is 16x16 px, it will be aweful when showing it in the Unity panel, for instance, which doesn't happen when you use a .svg (Scalable Vectorial Grpahic, wich addapts to any kind of size).\nI prefer this way instead of the GUI way, because it's clearer what are you putting on the .desktop file.\nHope it helps you ;)\n", "Q: How to increase the partition size of Ubuntu installed under Windows? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I give Ubuntu 10.10 more space (when installed inside Windows 7 (via wubi))? \n\nI installed Ubuntu 11.04 under Windows (using Wubi) and the default size for the \"partition\" was chosen as 10GB. Now it shows frequent issues due to low disk space. How can I increase the size of partition without reinstalling?\n\nA: As Marky suggested in the comments, you can resize the disk image of a Wubi installation using any of these methods (written by bcbc).\nAlternatively, you can free up space in your Wubi image by moving some of your documents or other files like music, ebooks, or videos (just not programs or system files) to the host Windows system's partition (accessed as /host in your Wubi system).\n\nA: I don't think you can if it is a Wubi install.\nHowever a remarkably easy and very effective fix (other than starting from scratch, making a new partition and installing Ubuntu there) is to follow the instructions and use the script in HOWTO: migrate wubi install to partition in Ubuntu forums.\nI am a relative non-expert but I had this done in less than an hour (more like 30 mins) and it was perfect. It has the additional advantage that the Wubi (Windows) install remains intact just in case you have a problem with the migration and, of course, you will be able to change the new partition size if you need to later.\n", "Q: Can't run desktop python applications when switching out the default Python version I work on Google Appengine which requires Python 2.5.

I currently don't have internet access in the house which means I have to go the cafe after a fresh 11.04 install, can anyone provide a link where I can get a .deb package (amd64)  of ubuntu-restricted-extras for 11.04?\n\nA: Downloading the ubuntu-restricted-extras package itself wont help you much. It is actually a \"meta-package\", ie, a package with no \"real\" content, but with a list of dependencies. Thats why its size is so small.\nWhen you try to install it, it checks the dependencies and downloads and installs them. And those are a few tens of megabytes.\nSo, if you want a complete offline install, i suggest this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to any computer with internet, and use a Live CD/USB Ubuntu session. (so you have a clean OS with no extra package installed)\n\n*Open Synaptics (Administration -> Package Manager), use the Quick Search for ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n*In the list, double-click it. On the dialog window, click Mark.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Apply. \n\n*It will show a window of all the packages that must be installed. Those are the ones you need to download and install in your offline machine. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Either download them manually, or check the \"Download Package Files Only\" checkbox. The DEBs will be downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives\n\n*You can also use File -> Generate Package download script option. Create a folder for the script, save it, then run it. All DEBs will be downloaded to that folder. Copy the whole folder to a USB/DVD, then use File -> Add downloaded packages option in the offline computer.\nAnd, VERY important: both the offline and online computers must have the SAME architecture. (meaning 32/64 bits, OS, etc). So the package downloaded in one will be the correct one for the other.\n\nA: haha,, in indonesia which have slow connection, that's first thing that we do.Just download from \nhere\nand also ,if you want to install some apps from repository ,and you don't have connection but your friend or someone does, just go here type what you want to download, and the link appears with all dependencies\n\nA: If you have an internet connection on another computer (or you could always try a library), you could always download the required gstreamer .deb packages and put them on a flash drive.

I am looking for either a desktop recorder/screencast application that can output in WebM format, or a program that can convert the .ogv format generated by gtk-recordmydesktop into WebM.\nI have selected WebM as the format I need because it seems to be the only free codec supported by YouTube, where my recordings will end up. I've tried uploading an .ogv in the past and got solid green video, so that won't work for me.\nI live in the USA and I am conscious about trying to stay away from anything that might have software patent issues, like gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly or gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad. It was for this reason I was originally interested in Tibesti (for example), but that needed the installation of packages like the aforementioned.\nI've done some searching online for a free (as in both money and freedom) solution, but so far couldn't find anything. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can make WebM recordings in Ubuntu 11.10 + GNOME Shell by pressing the Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R key combination. \nThe first time you press the combo, a red circle appears in the notification area, indicating that recording started. The 2nd time you press it, the red circle disappears and you will have your recording in the ${HOME}/Videos directory.\nMore info here: Gnome Shell Cheat Sheet: Screencast recording\n\nA: 12.04 LTS\nIt appears that ffmpeg no longer works properly in this release for converting recordmydesktop's .ogv recordings to WebM. As it is no longer maintained, it's recommended to use its replacement avconv instead, provided in the libav-tools package (which seems to be automatically installed if ffmpeg was installed).\nThe command needed to use avconv for conversions is not too much different than from ffmpeg:\navconv -i input.ogv output.webm\n\nThus, if anybody's facing the same issue of trying to use only free packages to convert from .ogv to .webm in 12.04 (or presumably later), this is how I resolved it. This should be helpful if you're making recordings to show new features or document issues using video.\n\nA: I'm using things like that:\navconv -f x11grab -s 1024x768 -r 24 -i 0:0 -deadline realtime -b 5000000 -minrate 200000 -maxrate 40000000 recording-filename-000.webm\n\nWhere: \n-f x11grab - enforces screen capture \"format\" of input. \n-s 1024x768 is the resolution of input file (aka capture area). For example equals to desktop resolution. If smaller than that, recording area would be at left and top. I used 1024x768 recording area in this example. \n-r 24 - framerate. Basically, 23 to 30 FPS used by real movies to give a smooth recording picture. However for screencast it could be okay to reduce this to get better picture at lower bitrates. I used 24 to do game screen capture.\n-i 0:0 is a hint to use display 0:0 as source (device is in xorg notation). If you have only 1 monitor and default Xorg setup, 0:0 will be ok most of times.\n-deadline realtime - is a hint to libvpx. We want live capture. We want realtime performance. So libvpx will do it best to encode VP8 in REALTIME. To do so it somewhat trades quality for speed. At given bitrate quality will be a bit worse than it would be in non-realtime way. But encoding speed would skyrocket. So on my hardware it can crunch 1024x768@24FPS, intense scenes, without dropping any frames (powerful CPU recommended though). In this example I wanted a decent-quality live capture at good FPS and quite large capture area. So CPU usage by codec could be an issue. That's why this hint really needed for good results.\n-b 5000000 - target bitrate in bits/second. I used 5Mbits to get more-or-less good picture of quite intense scenes. Codec will try to keep average bitrate speed of video close to this value. The lower this value, the worse the quality and smaller the file. You can experiment a bit to get idea what bitrate is good for particular uses. Video sharing services would downconvert video if you overshoot. If you about to use own server, it's up to you to take care of traffic. If you undershoot, picture quality will be bad. Feel free to change value to get idea what's best for you. 5Mbits were intended for more or less eye-pleasant live capture of intense scenes at games where you can't easily see that picture is overcompressed. For capturing still applications you will basically need far less than that. \n-minrate 200000 - is a minimum allowed bitrate for codec. Depending on a nature of thing you want to capture, sometimes you may want to force minimum bitrate to keep a reasonably looking pictire at no matter what. Sometimes codec heuristic could reduce bitrate far below values you may want, giving bad picture at some scenes. This option allows to force codec to keep minimum bitrate even if codec thinks that scene is simple and bitrate could be dropped. High value of this parameter may increase file size by preventing codec from using lower bitrates. \n-maxrate 40000000 - This value controls maximum burst bitrate at intense scenes. I used really high value to allow codec to go far higher than desired average if it considers higher speed is mandatory to keep decent quality at some scene. To get a good-looking picture in all conditions it's desirable to set this high enough (40Mbits is BlueRay-like speed and will do the trick). On other hand, if you're about to stream it using your own server, you have to reduce this value at cost of some picture quality at intense scenes. Else server could fail to cope with desired burst bitrate, being unable to deliver it in realtime way to users. Then player would face buffer underrun (which is annoying). Video-sharing services will take care on their own and usually downconvert video to lower parameters at the cost of picture quality.\nrecording-filename-000.webm - is a file name of output. If you use .webm extension, ffmpeg/avconv are smart enough to understand you want WEBM. It is THAT simple - avconv guesses desired format from filename. So .WEBM files are WEBM inside. \nThat is it - this command does direct screen recording to webm file. No extra conversions needed and libvpx is hinted to be as fast as it can. There is no sound since there is no specification for sound input. It may or may not be what you want. For sound, you have to specify input source for sound stream as well.\nP.S. this may look a little overcomplicated but at the end of day you can figure out that one size can't fit all. So to get a good-looking picture in all situations you may really want to have some handles for codec used and want to adjust them. Ffmpeg gives you all the handles you may ever need and far more than that. It's a heavy weaponry of video conversion and encoding. So this example is a good point to start for those who want to do more or less advanced encodings and is ready to experiment a bit to get a really decent-looking results.\n\nA: Use transmageddon App to do that. its Gstreamer based app\nsudo apt-get install transmageddon or click here install transmageddon\n\nA: Use Kazam to record.\nOutput is mkv, and works well with Youtube.

It's a shared machine that needs no screen-locking, passwords, or anything else. (Perhaps it should have those features, but nobody would use it then.)\nAnyway, after the screensaver is activated, and subsequently deactivated, the interface often (though not always) freezes. By \"freeze,\" I mean that while the mouse pointer moves on the screen, the system (Unity, perhaps?) doesn't respond to clicks or normal keyboard input (Ctrl+Alt+F1 does work, however). Additionally, the clock in the panel stops updating and continues to display the time at which the freeze occurred (which appears to be during the time the screensaver was active). The only way I've found to recover is to issue sudo service gdm restart.\nAfter discovering this problem, I disabled the screensaver. That seemed to cure the problem for a while, but now it's back, showing up after the monitor has gone to sleep.

But if you install virtualbox from software center then any crash that produces bug report can be uploaded to Launchpad \n\nA: @Munna, There may be bug-reporting capability at the source from where you downloaded the package. Check for that.. You may be able to report your bug there. Opensource projects usually have a location for bug reporting. So even though your package is third-party(or unofficial), the bugs can be reported elsewhere.\n", "Q: How to delete a second swap partition safely? First of all I've tried to install Ubuntu , but something went wrong and the installation was interrupted. \nThen I tried to install again , and it was installed successfully.\nAnd there was another partition about 600 Mb , but I removed it using Disk Utility .And I had to restore grub from a live CD. \nbut Why is /dev/sda4  now extended and contains 2 linux swap ?And how can I remove the other linux swap? and how to make it one Linux partition with one swap ? \n\n\n\nWhen I try to remove /dev/sda5\nPlease unmount any logical partitions having a number higher than 5 . \n\n\nA: I'm not sure why your system ended up with 2 swap partitions, but it's easy to fix.\n\n\n*\n\n*I recommend using gparted instead of fdisk or Disk Utility. You can delete the \"extra\" swap partition and resize the others to claim the freed disk space. It will also tell you if either swap partitions are being actually used or not. Very helpful. gparted is not installed by default, but it is available for install in the repositories. It is also pre-installed in Live sessions from the Ubuntu install CD/USB.\n\n*About the extended partition: using a traditional partition table, you can only have 4 primary (\"non-extended\") partitions. Since you already have 3 NTFS/Windows, and you need 2 more for Ubuntu (OS and Swap), this only can be done using an extended partition. So your 4 primary partitions are the 3 NTFS ones + Extended (the extended partition itself takes up 1 \"slot\"), and the other partitions are within the extended.\n\n*Using gparted, check the status of your swap partitions. If they are locked, it's being currently used by the system. Take note of their status, and decide which one you want to keep and which to delete. Also, right-click them both, go to information, and take note of their UUID (sudo blkid also works). \nThe possible scenarios are:\n1 - The one you want to delete is NOT being used by the system: nice, just delete the partition.\n2 - Both swaps are being used by the system: right-click it the one you want to delete, select Swapoff. To make that permanent, remove its entries from /etc/fstab and /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume (deleting the lines that match its UUID). Now you can safely delete the partition.\n3 - Just the one you want to delete is being used, the one you want to keep is not: right-click the one you want to delete, select Swapoff. Right-click the other, select Swapon. Edit /etc/fstab and /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume, and replace the UUID from one to the other. Delete the unwanted partition. \nIf any changes are made to /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume, use the following command to apply the changes: \nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nIf you have any question about the answer, feel free to ask!\n\nA: Identify your partition using \nsudo blkid\n\nand look at /etc/fstab to see which swap partition is use\ngrep swap /etc/fstab\n\nThen delete the old swap partition, graphically with gparted or from the command line with fdisk.\nIf you wish to resize partitions, I suggest you do so with gparted from a live CD.\n\nA: What you get from the screenshots is that there are indeed two partitions that have been designated as swap partitions. Whether they are both used can be determined by running\nfree. \nFor example, the output of free has the lines\nSwap:      4200000          0    4200000\n\nThis means that there is one or more swap partitions totaling to about 4.2GB of swap space.\nYou can use free to establish whether both partitions are used as swap, or just one of them.\nThen, you can select which one to deactivate, by running (for the second swap)\nsudo swapoff /dev/sda7\n\nOnce deactivated, you can use the Disk Utility to erase the partition.\nWhen your computer boots up, it runs the command sudo swapon -a which activates all available swap partitions. Therefore, simply the removal of one of the swap partitions is enough to complete the work. No further action/configuration is required.\n", "Q: Why isn't Document Viewer 2.32.0 using subpixel rendering? Adobe Reader:\n\nDocument Viewer:\n\n\nA: It is a known issue that the Evince Document Viewer does not support subpixel rendering.\nDo a Google search for evince subpixel rendering. \nThe explanation\nWell, actually the problem is not that patches are not good enough,\nthe problem is that it's not possible to enable subpixel-hinted\nrendering without breaking transparencies. For subpixel-hinted\nrendering to work we would need to first fill the surface in white and\nthen call poppler_page_render to render the page, but PDF blend modes\nneed an initially transparent surface to work. We consider blend modes\nmore important than subpixel-hinted rendering of fonts. \n\nSource: http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evince-list/2010-October/msg00022.html\nThere are patches to use to enable subpixel rendering.

Is it possible to have 2 unity launchers? One on the Left and one on the Right. In my thoughts, the Left one (The Default) would have the normal stuff that i use everyday. The Right side would have additional stuff that i might use like wine programs or to show the recent documents. Just some ideas to my reason to having 2 panels. Is it possible/optional?\n\nA: Unfortunately it's not possible to have more than one launcher in Unity.\n\nA: You only get the one launcher in Unity, but you can simulate a second one if you use a combination of AWN and DockbarX with the appropriate theming. This is how I got a Unity-like interface on my 10.04 LTS desktop before 11.04 came out. The advantage of this is that the second panel that you created is then fully customizable, so you can create the setup you have just described.\nDockbarX is not available to install from the default Ubuntu repositories, so I'll show you a way to simulate a second launcher using only AWN, which is available right from the Ubuntu Software Center. I did the steps below on my Precise Pangolin install, but you should be able to follow them on 11.10 as well and most likely older releases.\nSimulating a second launcher with AWN\nOur goal is to get a second launcher on the right, as pictured below:\n\nFirst, we need AWN (Avant Window Navigator) installed. Click here to install it, or run in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator\n\nThis should also install awn-settings, which will let you manage the settings for AWN.\nNow start AWN Settings by searching for it in the dash, and let's start setting up the second launcher.\nYou'll get a window like that below:\n\nChange all settings to those shown above.\nNext, go to the Applets screen. We'll be using the below configuration (but feel free to modify as you please):\n\nThe applets, from left to right (the ordering matters), are:\n\n*\n\n*Cairo Main Menu\n\n*Launcher/Taskmanager\n\n*Related applet\n\n*Shiny Switcher\n\n*Expander (Needed to keep the previous applets near the top and the trash at the bottom)\n\n*Garbage\nNext, go to Themes and select the Dark Theme. We'll use this as a base for the exact look we want.\nClick the Customize button near the bottom of the window to enter this view:\n\nThere's a lot of tweaking to do in here. Here are the following changes you need to make (note: I listed colors as a hexadecimal value, or \"Color name\", and Opacity):\nPanel Colors\n\n*\n\n*First Gradient Color: #000000, 170\n\n*Second Gradient Color: #000000, 170\n\n*First Highlight Color: #000000, 0\n\n*Second Highlight Color: #000000, 0\n\n*Outer Border Color: #808080, 100\n\n*Inner Border Color: #000000, 0\n\nTooltips\n\n*\n\n*Font: Ubuntu 11\n\n*Fill Color: #000000, 170\n\n*Outline Color: #FFFFFF, 100\n\nExtras\n\n*\n\n*Arrow type: Triangle\n\nIn case you're wondering: nope, still not quite done yet! There's some extra settings we need to take care of to position the launcher correctly; otherwise, it'll run over the menu bar at the top of the screen.\nNow go into the Advanced screen:\n\nMake sure Force monitor mode? is checked.\nNow, make sure you set the following settings to what I've described below. If you don't know what your display resolution is, you can easily look it up by searching for \"Displays\" in the dash or System Settings.\n\n*\n\n*Monitor width: Your actual monitor width in pixels\n\n*Monitor height: Your actual monitor height in pixels, minus 24\n\n*Monitor X-offset: 0\n\n*Monitor Y-offset: 24\n\nFor good measure, we should also set Reflection alpha multiplier to 0 while we're in here.\nAlmost done! We have a couple applet tweaks to make, if you decided to keep the Shiny Switcher and Garbage applets I suggested above so they're more like regular Unity. To enter the preferences for either applet, right-click it and select Applet Preferences from the pop-up menu.\nShiny Switcher Preferences\nCheck that the settings are the same as those pictured (the colors selected are #000000, 255):\n\n\nGarbage Preferences\nKeep Confirm when emptying the trash checked, but uncheck Show the item count on the icon.\n\nOne more note! To test out your settings and make sure everything looks right, or if you did not set AWN to start automatically, search\nfor \"Avant Window Navigator\" in the dash. I personally found that\ncertain settings changes may require quitting AWN (via right-click on\nthe dock itself) and restarting it in order for them to display\nproperly.\n\n", "Q: Show Desktop Ctrl-Alt-D stopped working for Firefox only.

I have been a Dropbox subscriber for two years, and I want badly to change to Ubuntu One mainly because I want to support Canonical.\nAfter some tests, yesterday (May 26th, 2011), I subscribed Dropbox for another year. The performance is way way better (at least for my files, mainly pictures and code). And I badly need the Android support (now not next year), like you I started to travel only with my phone and I don't want to carry my laptop again (I changed my netbook for a 12\" laptop last year).\nI'm going to stay with Dropbox another year and check again Ubuntu One next year. If it fits my needs I'll change in a breeze.\nNote that this is just my experience, maybe other people with different files (like maybe music), or who uses a lot some of the extra syncing features from Ubuntu One (like contacts, bookmarks or favorites) will find Ubuntu One better for them.\n\nA: To directly answer your question:\nFOR NOW\nUse the free version of Dropbox for now and use their android app, keeping in mind that the android app does NOT do an automatic sync, it syncs your Dropbox listings, you must choose what you want downloaded to your phone. Also you must choose from android what you wish to \"share\" back to the cloud, but you can do that with anyfile anywhere on your phone or card.

I thought tar archive.tar /users/mylocation would work, but it doesn't. How can I do that? \n\nA: Combining the previous answers and comments:\nTo simply extract the contents and create target directory if it is missing:\nmkdir -p /target/directory && tar xf archive.tar -C /target/directory\n\nTo extract and also remove the root(first level) directory in the zip\nmkdir -p /target/directory && tar xf archive.tar -C /target/directory --strip-components=1\n\n\nA: Another option is to use --one-top-level. This will automatically create a directory based on the filename of the original.\ntar zxvf filename.tgz --one-top-level\n\nAdditionally if you want, you can specify your own and tar will create it automatically.\ntar zxvf filename.tgz --one-top-level=new_directory\n\n\nA: Note that if your tarball already contains a directory name you want to change, add the --strip-components=1 option:\ntar xf archive.tar -C /target/directory --strip-components=1\n\n\nA: What I found interesting in relation to extraction is, that it depends how you created the archive, see this example\ncd /tmp\nmkdir folder\ntouch folder/file.txt\n\nwhen you do tar -zcvf folder.tar.gz folder everything is as expected = when you untar it now it will be untarred (folder will be create, if you removed it) as /tmp/folder/.\nBut, when you will create tar as tar -zcvf tmp-folder.tar.gz /tmp/folder and you untar it in /tmp folder, the result will be /tmp/tmp/folder directory ! In such case you have to untar it to / - tar -xf tmp-folder.tar.gz -C /\n\nA: To extract an archive to a directory different from the current, use the -C, or --directory, tar option, as in\ntar -xf archive.tar -C /target/directory\n\nNote that the target directory has to exist before running that command (it can be created by mkdir /target/directory).\nRead the manual page (command: man tar) for other options.\n", "Q: How to scan for analog cable channels on a DVB-T USB tuner?

I'm using ubuntu 11.04.  Disk utility is reporting I have a bad sector on my hard drive.

Run sudo badblocks -b 512 /dev/sda to scan the disk and find where the bad sector is.  It will show the number of the bad sector.  You can then verify it with:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null iflag=direct bs=512 skip=sector_number count=1\n\nMake sure you type the command exactly as stated, using the correct sector_number from badblocks.  This should fail with an IO error ( since the sector is bad ).  If it doesn't, then you got something wrong.  If it does, then you can proceed with trying to repair the bad sector:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda oflag=direct bs=512 seek=sector_number count=1\n\nAfter that, check the SMART status again and the pending_count should have gone down.  If the reallocated_count is still zero, then the disk is fine.\n\nA: I find that the disks utility is fairly accurate.\nwhen it reports bad sectors though, it includes pending sectors. \nas in you could have 2 pending sectors (sectors with poor performance)\nand it would tell you there are a few bad sectors. \nThe statement \"a few\" isn't exactly explicit either, and is relative to the disk size. \nAs in, a 4GB disk with 53 \"failed sectors\" is in critical condition. (IMHO) where a larger disk with more sectors may also have more sectors available for failure. disks does no such analysis of those conditions, it simply reports back on the sensor data. \nfailed or pending MBR sectors can cause boot problems when the disk just doesn't respond in time to boot. \n", "Q: Stop Terminal to auto-put forward slash in front of $HOME I am running 11.04.\nEvery time i tried to a command such as \nmv flieA $HOME/<somedir>/\n\nTerminal automatically put \"\\\" in front of $HOME when I hit the 'Tab' key for autocomplete\nmv flieA \\$HOME/<somedir>/\n\nit's incredibly annoying, how can i fix this.\n\nA: Use ~ instead of $HOME.

The reason for that is its internet-based application dependencies solving and community support.\nTo get Ubuntu for free, you will have to download the image of the disk yourself. If you would like a pre-burned copy shipped, you can buy whichever you need here: http://shop.canonical.com/index.php?cPath=17 , though that only allows you to get many copies at a time.\nOh, and also, a piece of advise: don't use wubi (the Ubuntu installer that installs Ubuntu from Windows) for anything important.

But don't worry, that's already a very nice resolution for 13 inch laptops.\nThe listed 8192 x 8192 is the maximum amount of pixels your video card can handle, or the maximum \"virtual resolution\". This gives you room to plug in external monitors. Horizontally and vertically, you can support up to 8192 pixels, so you can plug in a 1920x1080 monitor, which will make your total virtual resolution (1440+1920)x1080 or 3360x1080.\n", "Q: Is there a list of wireless adapters that work on Ubuntu with no hassle?

I've never supported Apple in any way, but I like their hardware. As I've just purchased and got working a nice Apple wireless keyboard (bought second-hand!), I'm curious about the possibility of buying a second-hand MacBook and installing Ubuntu on it. \nWhat, of what's important, isn't working? Notably, I do Flash Player development from time to time, so I do at the very least need to get a 32-bit debug player installed. (I usually run 64-bit, so I'm familiar with having to tweak things to get it all working properly) I'd also need to be able to play DVDs with CSS, run Google Chrome, etc. Is it fairly similar in capabilities as a non-Apple computer as far as what I can use? It seems that there's a different architecture used, namely PowerPC, and I don't know what this means to me as an end-user. \nCan anyone recommend me for or against installing Ubuntu on MacBookPro?\n\nA: It can be done. I'd take a look at the Apple Users sub-forum on ubuntuforums.org for in-depth details.\nThese are also two good starting points for info: 1, 2.\nAlso check out which model MacBook it would be. For example I have a crappy plastic one that's a couple of years old. Runs like a trooper. It's designated '5,2'. The model type will be important in determining what needs to be done to get things working.\nPRO\n\n\n*\n\n*Lovely hardware.\n\n*Flexibility of GNU/Linux.\n\n\nCON\n\n\n*\n\n*Things like special function keys won't work out-of-the-box.\n\n*Battery life will be significantly lower [citation needed].\n\n*A generally less integrated experience (e.g. I notice that Thunderbolt and WLAN aren't working yet with Natty and the latest offering of MacBook Pros).\n\n*Hibernate and suspend tend to be a bit iffy.\n\n*You're getting rid of what is, in my opinion, a pretty good OS. If you need the *nix aspect of Linux it's all there. If you want something like the repository system you have options available too.\n\n\nMy idea would be to set-up a dual-boot environment.\nUnless you're considering buying a very old Mac notebook, you needn't worry about the PowerPC architecture.\nPlaying DVDs is easily done. I've never had much fun with 64-bit Flash. Google Chrome arguably works better in Ubuntu.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: All current MacBookPros are Intel-based, and 64 bit. Have a look at the compatibility table for the indiviual MacBookPro models, as there can be a lot of variability in hardware support. I use a 6,2 model (15\" from 2010 series), and I believe it to be the best option (along with with the other 2010 models: 6,1 and 7,1 models).\nThe wireless and nvidia drivers work automatically (which is new in Natty). The backlight control has just been fixed (manual install), saving a lot of battery (not as quite as efficient as MacOS, but better than an average PC). Hibernate does not work, but suspend works fine. DVDs are fine, but regionless/ripped DVDs are blocked at the hardware level (Matshita drive). See the remaining details at (and related pages for other models):\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro6-2/Natty\nOlder models generally have more problems (firmware and wifi issues in the 5,x and older series). The latest 8,x series (2011, with Sandy Bridge), had some issues booting. In the long run, the 8,x will probably be better (potential to boot from USB), but at the moment, the 2010 series (6,1 6,2 and 7,1) probably has the best hardware support. If you wait until the fall for Ubuntu 11.10, you might consider the 8,x, but if you're looking for a used one, you're more likely to find 6,x and 7,1 now. \n", "Q: Broadcom STA Wireless Driver Fails to install I'm setting up a Dell M4400 Precision, and on previous installations I've merely installed the Broadcom STA Wireless Driver from the \"Additional Drivers\" app.  However with 11.04, I get this error: Sorry, installation of this driver failed.\nPlease have a look at the log file for details: /var/log/jockey.log.\nWhich contains: \n2011-05-26 19:18:33,726 WARNING: /sys/module/wl/drivers does not exist, cannot rebind wl driver\n2011-05-26 19:18:33,743 DEBUG: BroadcomWLHandler enabled(): kmod disabled, bcm43xx: blacklisted, b43: blacklisted, b43legacy: blacklisted\n\nWifi works fine on Windows, and had worked fine in Ubuntu 8.10-10.10.

But very few focus on some of the issues that concerns me the most. So, given we now have a new Ubuntu 11.04 and new Linux Mint 11 recently released, its time for some upgrades! :D\nI have Mint 10 installed, and would like to upgrade it to 11, and also install Ubuntu 11.01 Natty side-by-side in a separate partition.\nHere is my current setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*10 GB NTFS Win XP (gaming performance)\n\n*30 GB NTFS Win 7 (rarely used, im considering changing to Virtual Box instead)\n\n*30 GB EXT4 / Linux Mint 10 (my main OS)\n\n*5 GB swap (i have 4GB RAM)\n\n\nAnd on sdb:\n\n\n*\n\n*a bazilion GB NTFS /dados (docs, music, videos, pics, ISOs, and all OS-neutral data)\n\n\nThat means /home currently holds basically only config files in the ~/.hidden folders.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If my data is already in a separate partition, would a separate /home partition be any useful? Why and how?\n\n*How would different (but similar) distros (Mint 10, 11, and Ubuntu Natty) behave when sharing the same /home partition? What about config files? Would, for instance, FireFox 3.6 (from Mint 10/Ubuntu Maverick) play nice with FireFox 4 if they both use the same ~/.firefox config folder? What about \"system\" setings like ~/.gconf, ~/.gnome2, ~/.config, etc? Wouldnt it be a nasty mess if a separate, shared /home is used? How that should be dealed with?\n\n*Same goes for /boot: If each OS mounts it, wont they also change/upgrade them? Since each uses a different grub version, wont that mess it up? Any chances of version mismatch between the bootsector image and the /boot contents due to different Oses mounting / updating it?\n\n*What about username / user ID / stored passwords? Would all distros behave correctly? I know the first user created in Ubuntu have some unique tweaks (ID=1000, tweaked permisions, etc). How would it be if Ubuntu is presented with a separate (and already existing) /home with a user at install? Would vault, for instance, works?\nIm the only user of my computer, so multi-user flexibilty is not an great issue (but it would be nice if possible)\nGiven that, I would like some opinions, warnings, or any input that might help me to set up a good partition scheme. This is not an objective question, im looking for subjective suggestions and things to consider. Moderators feel free to change to community. Words on how ~/.config files work for different software versions in a shared and/or upgraded enviroment are greatly apreciated.\nThanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Seperate homes for any linux is advisable. Even between the same Ubuntu I would advice that. For instance: Ubuntu 11.04 classic and Ubuntu 11.04 Natty use the same files for ubuntu software center. See this: Why are my two ubuntu installs on separate partitions sharing the same apt-get data?\n\n*The potential for messing it up is not worth the risk (to me).\n\n*Yes, it can mess it up. \n\n*AFAIK yes it would work. If it doesn't all you need to do is change the UID of that user to the same UID and all should be normal.\nAsk yourself what you need inside your home folder.

I have just installed Ubuntu Server 10.04 with a LAMP setup.  I want to host a website there but I'm not sure which is the best way to get/edit my files on the server.  Googling provides many options but I'm not sure which is best?\nUnless there's a better option, I'd like to be create the pages on another PC (Windows or Linux) and use SFTP to sync the changes to the server - but do I do this to a symlinked folder in ~/ or by changing rights on the /var/www/ folder?\n\nA: Every setup is different. For me I have a lot of users on a server that each hosts websites, for you, you likely won't need to create more than just one user on the system. However, if you manage multiple websites on this server this setup will help you to manage, configure, and debug each domain in a fashion easier than a standard LAMP setup. In order for that to happen I utilize several devices by Apache to get around permission errors.\nFirst, this is the document structure I use:\n/home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]/html\n/home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]/logs\n\nEach user has their own account with a domains folder (which I added to /etc/skel so it gets created every time. Each domain has it's own folder in the domains folder with an html folder (I have my reasons for this, primarily so domains can have web files outside of the public realm). Feel free to modify this structure as you see fit, just remember to carry those changes throughout this post.\nSecondly, I host a lot of PHP sites so I use suPHP in my configuration. By default the standard archive package doesn't have the proper compile flag enabled resulting in a less secure version of suPHP. I've made my own suPHP package which I use on my servers, installation instructions below. suPHP allows you to define what user PHP scripts should be executed as (among other things including: custom php.ini for each site, etc). I also enable suExec for Apache - further removing the need to have any ownership to www-data user (a user which I despise).\nFirst ensure you have Apache, and all other services installed on your server. Make sure they are at least working. After that I recommend installing suphp-common and the required libapache2-mod-suphp module (More information: What are PPAs and how do I use them?). Then, after those install, activate suPHP and suexec using a2enmod\nsudo a2enmod suphp\nsudo a2enmod suexec\nsudo a2dismod php5\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache restart\n\nNext will come the configuration file. I've made various tools that automatically generate the configuration files everytime I add a new site; however, here is the basic template I use:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin [EMAIL]\n    ServerName [DOMAIN]\n    ServerAlias www.[DOMAIN] [DOMAIN]\n    DocumentRoot /home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]/html\n\n    <Directory /home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]>\n            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n            AllowOverride all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ErrorLog /home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]/logs/error.log\n\n    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,\n    # alert, emerg.\n    LogLevel warn\n\n    CustomLog /home/[USER]/domains/[DOMAIN]/logs/access.log combined\n\n    SuexecUserGroup [USER] [USER]\n\n    suPHP_UserGroup [USER] [USER]\n    suPHP_ConfigPath /home/[USER]/etc\n</VirtualHost>\n\nThis sets up logging for that domain, the document root, and all other basic necessities for the domain to operate. I place these files in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ typically named [USER]-[DOMAIN] and enable/disable them with a2ensite like so:\nsudo a2ensite [USER]-[DOMAIN]\nsudo a2dissite [USER]-[DOMAIN]\n\nAfter each modification to configuration files Apache will need to be reloaded with\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache reload\n\nWhile it may seem like a lot to setup the amount of flexibility gained, in my opinion, far outweighs the setup time. Though you only need a single user webserver, in the future if you ever wanted anything other than a single user webserver, you would need to perform further actions (or just drop security all together) in order to do so.\n\nA: Sftp is very easy to install. Just install the package openssh-server and you will have sftp. Make sure your user has a good password if you can get to it from the internet. (8+ characters, not a dictionary word, has symbols and numbers).\nFor permissions, I usually do this \nsudo adduser <username> www-data\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www\nsudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www\nYou should then be able to post pages by connecting with sftp (using your username and password) and then going to the /var/www folder and placing your files there.\n\nA: I use webdav. It's very easy to install on Ubuntu Server. If you have apache installed you're almost done. Just sudo a2enmod dav; service apache2 restart. You'll need to do a little configuration of your virtual site. Here's an example that I'm using in production:\n<VirtualHost *>\n    ServerName webdav.mysite.com\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@mysite.com\n\n    DocumentRoot /srv/mysite\n    DAVLockDB /var/lock/apache2/DAVLock\n    <Directory /srv/mysite>\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    Dav On\n    DAVMinTimeout 600\n    DAVDepthInfinity On\nAuthName \"mysite login\"\nAuthType Basic\nAuthUserFile /srv/mysite/.htpassword\nRequire valid-user\n\n    </Directory>\nphp_admin_value engine off\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *>\n\n    ServerName mysite.com\n    ServerAlias *.mysite.com\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@mysite.com\n\n    DocumentRoot /srv/mysite/www\n    <Directory /srv/mysite/www>\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /srv/mysite/cgi-bin/\n</VirtualHost>\n\nYou can put this in /srv/etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite and then do sudo a2ensite mysite; sudo service apache2 reload.\nWhat is happening here is you've created two virtual sites. One is www.mysite.com and the other is webdav.mysite.com. PHP has been disabled on webdav.mysite.com which is important.\nNow you can access your site over http on Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS. All three have built in webdav support. Here are instructions on adding a webdav network location in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would give write permissions to /var/www to the www-data and add your user to that group. That way it would be easy to control which users can write to that directory.\nsudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www\nsudo chmod g+w -R /var/www \nusermod -a -G www-data your-user\n\n\nA: Are you after something like this\nrsync -az --rsh \"ssh\" --rsync-path \"sudo rsync\" ~/website ubuntu@REMOTE-IP:/var/www\n\n\nA: Are you using any framework for your site? Drupal, Wordpress, etc? Drupal for example has tools to upload via browser interaction.\nHave you looked into Samba? You can setup a Samba share (and there are tons of resources on the web for them) and simply use Windows Explorer to open/edit/save/delete. Setup /var/www to be shared and then map the \"network drive\" to windows.\nIs this a work or a home environment? It sounds like home, but if you are in a work environment... you can pair Samba with Active Directory with tools like Likewise-Open. I have a server/website setup such that those in the IT shop can log in to either side of the server (linux or website) via their AD credentials.\nI'd also suggest looking into something like Mercurial. Create a repository on the server, and sync with windows via something like TortiseHG.

In our office everyone is using Windows, and our workgroup is simply WORKGROUP. I've installed samba, and its conf is:\n   workgroup = WORKGROUP\n   #   security = user\n\n   [share]\n   path = /media/Repo/share  // this is another partition\n   browsable = yes\n   guest ok = yes\n   read only = no\n   create mask = 0755\n\nbut still nobody can access my share folder and the machine cannot even be seen on the network. But I can access others shared folders.\nIs there anything I needed to do that I left out?\n\nA: Did you add yourself to samba users?\nYou can try this GUI to configure it: system-config-samba \nI did this to configure mine:\nPreferences > Server settings > Basic: input your Workgroup  \nPreferences > Server settings > Security: Authentication Mode=User, Guest Account=No Guest Account  \nPreferences > Samba Users > Add user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a Linux account (the one Samba will use when accessing the shared files. Usually, you want to choose yourself.)\n\n*Type in a user name and a password (does not have to be a real windows account or password, its just the input that Ubuntu will ask when someone tries to access the share. It can be \"aaa\" / \"bbb\")\nSo, basically, sharing folders involves two different authentications: first, the one that SAMBA, via SMB protocol, asks for from anyone that tries to access a share. That's step 2 above. Then, after Samba grants that person rights to access the share, Samba itself will need OS authorization to access to the filesystem and its files (the Linux owner-group-world security model). For that, Samba uses the user selected in step 1 above. So any folder (and files) you share must be accessible, inside Linux, by the user selected.\nIn the Windows world it works the same: there's the share authentication and the NTFS one.\nLast but not least: whatever user you select (usually yourself), make sure that it has the Share Files with the Network privilege in Administration > Users and Groups > Advanced Settings button > Privileges tab. I think Ubuntu already grants this privilege to the first user it creates, but it doesn't hurt to check it out.\nAlso, to share folders, I don't use this GUI, I use Nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the folder you want to share\n\n*Select \"Sharing Options\"\n\n*Give the share a name, and select read/write or anonymous access\n\n\nHope that works for you too!\n\nA: You can simply run a simpleHTTP server in the Linux machine and access the same on the other machine.\nSteps :  \n\n\n*\n\n*first start the terminal from the folder to be shared.\n\n*run in terminal python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\n*check your IP using ifconfig\n\n*enter into the browser of the other machine the ip address:8000\neg: if your IP is 127.3.4.123\nThen in browser you type 127.3.4.123:8000\nyou get the required files in the folder to download.\n\n", "Q: How to keep an external hard drive spinning?

Maybe Alberto can experiment with this.\n\nA: How is Chrome being opened?  Specifically, I am curious about the command issued by the launcher.

Is there a way to get the Unity window maximization behavior with Ubuntu \"Classic\"?\n\nA: From a quick scout about it appears that unity isn't modular at present, so you can't have the globalmenu without unity.\nBut you can effectively remove the unity dock from your desktop.\nInstall CCSM apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nUnder the Ubuntu Unity Plugin section make the following changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reveal Mode: Change this so that none of the edges are selected\n\n*Set Hide Launcher to 'Auto-hide'\n\n*Clear the short-cut keys\n\n\nThat will make the unity dock disappear immediately after launching.\nYou can then get your gnome-panels back by adding 'gnome-panel' to your start-up applications using the control centre. \n\nA: You can always install just the globalmenu from here. It works in almost the same way as unity's - with the only difference being that it doesn't hide the menus when the mouse is far from the bar. \nThis way you can use the features classic has (more panels if you want to, applets on the panels etc) and have more space as well.\nedit : i also found this which seems even easier than my first idea - simple 3-4 clicks at maximum\n", "Q: How do I clean up my dconf database? Dconf is pretty young, yet my database is already a mess with lots of \"schema-less\" keys. Is there a way to do some cleaning up, or would I need to start from scratch (by removing ~/.config/dconf/user I guess)?\n\nA: If you want to clean the dconf database, you first have to dump the whole dconf configuration via:\nmorfik:~$ cd ~/.config/dconf/\nmorfik:~/.config/dconf$ dconf dump / > user-backup\nmorfik:~/.config/dconf$ ls -al ./user-backup\n-rw-r--r-- 1 morfik morfik 30.0K 2015-02-07 08:18:04 ./user-backup\nmorfik:~/.config/dconf$ rm user\n\nAfter those steps you have to reopen your graphical session (log out/in). This will create the ~/.config/dconf/user file anew with almost 0 content -- default settings.\nAs for the user-backup file you had created earlier, it's just a plain text file:\n...\n[apps/light-locker]\nlate-locking=false\nlock-after-screensaver=uint32 1\nlock-on-suspend=true\n...\n\nSo you can edit it and remove the desired entries/blocks from that file.

Unfortunately, Unity keeps focus on the right window while raising the new one.

Is there a way to prevent raise without focus?\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it by going into CCSM > General Options > Focus & Raise Behaviour. There, all I did was change the Focus Prevention Level to Low. Now, when I open an application via the Dash, it open up on top and has focus.\n\nA: In CCSM, under General Options, you can play around with the auto-raise and its delay.\nI would guess that having auto-raise on, and the delay set to 0, would keep the window in focus on top, regardless.\nI must admit I'm struggling a little to understand exactly the behavior you want, or how to duplicate it; so this might be a little bit off the mark.\n\nA: I never did get this to work right in 11.10, in spite of tweaking CCSM and other antics.

Either you create and restore with tar or you create with sbackup and restore with srestore.\nThere is a GUI for restoring your files that you made with sbackup. If you need command line (due to removing /home)\nsudo srestore.py {backupfile} /home/$USER\n(this will restore from {backupfile} the files from /home/$USER to /home/$USER; if you want it somewhere else you can add a 2nd directory as adestination).\nThis might also solve your date problem: srestore probably uses tar but another (older) version of tar that you have installed.\n", "Q: Disabling Zeitgeist I have zeitgeist daemon always in processes. I don't see the point of this zeitgeist, it logs my activity. i removed it from startup programs, but it is still there.\nCan I uninstall this package? Why do I need it at all?\n\nA: I found hints about renaming of /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop, but it isn't enough. It prevents Zeitgeist from running at startup, but in my case (Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS) it started later somehow (perhaps as a result of some DBus activity).\nIf you'd like to keep Zeitgeist installed, but prevent it from running, try renaming its executables:\nzeitgeist-daemon --quit\ncd /usr/bin/\nsudo mv zeitgeist-daemon zeitgeist-daemon.bak\nsudo mv zeitgeist-datahub zeitgeist-datahub.bak\n\nNow Zeitgeist daemon won't start. You can check this later with ps aux | grep [z]eitgeist.  You can also purge the database which was collected by Zeitgeist by deleting ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/ folder with its contents, if you like to save some space.\nTo secure these files from updating you can also lock packages zeitgeist-core and zeitgeist-datahub in Synaptic or Aptitude.\nTo revert the changes simply rename these executables back:\ncd /usr/bin/\nsudo mv zeitgeist-daemon.bak zeitgeist-daemon\nsudo mv zeitgeist-datahub.bak zeitgeist-datahub\n\nIf you altered .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart/, you should also return it back.\n\nA: Here's an editorial on the topic of zeitgeist, including an interview with the creator:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/is-zeitgeist-spying-on-you\nAnd some instructions on disabling (not removal)\nhttp://linuxaria.com/howto/how-to-remove-zeitgeist-in-ubuntu-and-why\nAn easy way to reduce the logging (but not the heavy resource and disk use) is via the control panel:\n\nUnfortunately little about Zeitgeist is well disclosed or clear.  Zeitgeist is not easy to disable, nor is it easy to see what it's doing.  You can't \"stop\" it like other background system services.\n\nA: Run sudo apt-get remove zeitgeist* in a terminal. It might remove a few related packages, but so long as you don't see anything suggested for removal that you don't want, you should be fine.\nAs per comments: you will lose unity functionality (I was not sure how much when I first wrote the answer) if you remove zeitgeist. So, I suggest you just disable logging.\nYou can also turn off logging altogether from system settings.\n\nA: There is an easy way described here -- which does not include deleting any package, but simply de-activating the corresponding services. I didn't try it myself, but this way side-effects should be minimal (and probably even wanted, as e.g. no \"recent items\" being available etc. Moreover, it is easily revertable in case of \"unwanted\" side effects.\nThe author of that article explicitly states:\nHere is a way to disable this logging without breaking Unity or any other part of the system, execute these commands in a terminal:\nsudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop-inactive\nrm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nmkdir ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist\n\nReverting this (if one wants to enable Zeitgeist again) thus should be done like this:\nmkdir ~/.local/share/zeitgeist\nrmdir ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n# no action for the .xbel file, as it will be re-created automatically\nsudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop-inactive /etc/xdg/autostart/zeitgeist-datahub.desktop\n\nwhich is simply \"reversing\" the steps of the de-activation.\nRemark: The ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel has nothing to do with Zeitgeist itself, it just falls into the same category somehow. The article mentioned is about \"disabling activity logging\", and thus included this. If you just want to disable Zeitgeist, you can skip the two middle steps.\n\nA: If you remove Zeitgeist then the  menu in Unity wont work properly, it stops you searching for programs by typing into the box.\n\nA: My problem with zeitgeist are distracting error messages in journalctl:\n$ journalctl -xe | grep zeitgeist.SimpleIndexer\nOct 20 05:30:06 alien org.gnome.zeitgeist.SimpleIndexer[2098]: ** (zeitgeist-fts:4341): WARNING **: Unable to get info on application://nautilus-autostart.desktop\nOct 20 05:30:06 alien org.gnome.zeitgeist.SimpleIndexer[2098]: ** (zeitgeist-fts:4341): WARNING **: Unable to get info on application://eyesome-cfg.desktop\n\n$ journalctl -b-1 | grep zeitgeist\nOct 16 04:47:02 alien org.gnome.zeitgeist.Engine[2134]: Performing VACUUM operation...

The videos might have different frame rate and resolution, as they came from different cameras.\nWhat's the easiest way to concatenate these videos? Is there an straightforward way to make simple edits (rotating, cropping etc.?)\nI've tried mencoder:\nmencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o output.avi 1.avi 2.avi 3.avi\n\nBut it fails for different fps.\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Concatenate: openShot (Thanks, fossfreedom!)\n\n*FPS change: this answer from Ubuntu Forums\n\n*Rotate: Avidemux to rotate.\n\n\nA: I'm not clear if you want a command line type answer, but given that you said that there are different videos and framerates and you want to do simple edits, then I would use a good video editor such as OpenShot or KdenLive to amalgamate all the videos on one track and export as one video format.\n\n\nA: May be this question deserves more an answer for a procedure other than a single shot command or single gui process.\nTranscoding the videos may be a solution for you\nFirst of all you should make all your videos to be the same frame rate, then your own command will result in what you wish.\nThere are several suggestions for transcoding tools in this site but I am going to point you to my answer, if you don't mind of course, then, take a look at this: How can I maximum compress video files?\nThe interesting of this tool (The Mobile Media Converter) is that if you wish to have the command line for the transcodification and modify it for making a batch command line process, you can enter the \"Advanced\" section which will offer you different parameters to be set up manually and there will also be the FFMPEG command that you can drop in a terminal in order to transcode.\nAfter that, using your command line will result in concatenating video files if it is proved by you to work that way with same frame rate video files.\nThis way, my procedure for this answer would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*First Transcode the video files\nusing gui or command line.\n\n*Then drop your command line\n(mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o\noutput.avi 1.avi 2.avi 3.avi)\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: Have you given mjpegtools a shot?  It has been a while since I have messed around with video editing/conversion, but when I last used mjpegtools it was a CLI utility.  Still, very powerful and easy to use.  Mjpegtools can be found at sourceforge.net.\n\nA: Have a look at PiTiVi (in 11.04 it's installed by default)\n", "Q: Is it possible to change Unity Panel fonts or font size?

I searched here and didn't see this question already posted, but my apologies if I already missed it.\nI've noticed lately that my Weather Indicator applet is no longer showing weather icons.

Any ideas?\nEDIT: Changing the icon theme does not seem to make any difference.\n\nA: Google changed the icons without advertisement. New version of My-Weather-Indicator was released to fix this problem.\n\nA: After having switched icon themes, I too noticed that I would not get the icons to display for the forecast.  Without experimentation, (I am guessing somewhat here) I suspect it is my choice of icon theme that is preventing the icon display.  Let me take a look and determine if this is the case.\nAlright, I took a look and it would appear that my initial inclination was incorrect.  That is, I tried changing the icon theme, refreshed the weather indicator and came up with the same results.  I know that it was working at some point.  Perhaps something has gone awry on Yahoo's end.\n\nA: I'm a developer for indicator-weather, which is what it looks like you're using.  As @atareao mentioned, Google changed its icons. Yahoo should still work for current weather, but all forecasts are from Google and so will also be broken.\nIf you want to keep using indicator-weather, I recommend installing our PPA: ppa:weather-indicator-team/ppa .  The version in the ubuntu repositories does not get updated frequently, and our PPA version has many new bug fixes.  There's more information on our Wiki.\nOnce you've updated to the new version, don't forget to quit and reopen indicator-weather to get the new version.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but after switching from Google to Yahoo icons came back. But If I switch back to Google the problem appears again. With yahoo it already been working for  more than 10 minutes, hope it will stay the same way :-)  \n", "Q: Where is VirtualBox shared folders mounted in a virtual guest?

I am wondering how can I auto-mount a partition (internal) on boot automatically. Currently I do something like \nmount /dev/sda3 /media/works\n\nBut I want it to be permanent. Also I have GParted, but the Partition > UnMount is greyed out (yes, unmount, even though I haven't mounted it)\n\nA: Unmount is greyed out because the partition isn't there to be unmounted. You haven't mounted it yet.\nTo make the partition auto-mount, first find out the UUID of /dev/sda3 by doing:\nsudo blkid\n\nI'll assume you're using ext4 on /dev/sda3. Open up gedit like so:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/fstab\n\n(Or, in the command line, sudo vim or sudo nano instead of gksudo gedit.)\nNow you want to add a line to the bottom of that file. It should look something like this (UUID will be different):\nUUID=03ec5dd3-45c0-4f95-a363-61ff321a09ff /media/works ext4 defaults  0      2\n\nFor more info on fstab, this is a good resource.\n\nA: Use Disks utility. Select the disk, then click Additional partition options icon. Choose Edit Mount Options from drop-down menu.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu Server and I made the permanent mount as follows with a disk already formatted in ext4.\nI have listed my disks and partitions with\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nAfter that, I listed the UUID of the partition I would like to mount permanently with the following command:\nsudo blkid /dev/sda2\n\nTo mount the partition I created a target location with\nsudo mkdir -p /home/files\n\nthen I rode with\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /home/files\n\nWe need to put the mounted partition in the /etc/fstab file\nDon't forget to make a backup first. run\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bkp\n\nTo avoid breaking the file system you need to look at the structure that is already in /etc/fstab for the disks that are already automounted. In my case it is like this\nsudo cat /etc/fstab\n\n# / was on /dev/sdb3 during curtin installation\n# device                                               dir type options  dump fsck\n/dev/disk/by-uuid/866f0e5d-e590-450c-beff-507620a4afbd /   ext4 defaults 0     1\n\nOn the site  Arch Linux Wiki it is presented what this structure means. Below is an excerpt:\n\n*\n\n*<device> describes the block special device or remote file system to be mounted; see #Identifying file systems.\n\n*<dir> describes the mount directory.\n\n*<type> the file system type.\n\n*<options> the associated mount options; see mount(8) §FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT_MOUNT_OPTIONS and ext4(5) §MOUNT_OPTIONS.\n\n*<dump> is checked by the dump(8) utility. This field is usually set to 0, which disables the check.\n\n*<fsck> sets the order for file system checks at boot time; see fsck(8). For the root device it should be 1. For other partitions it should be 2, or 0 to disable checking.\n\nEdit the /fstab file with\nsudo vim /etc/fstab\n\nor\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nIn the file I added the following line\n/dev/disk/by-uuid/6d81205-fc60-44ce-9da2-3565aa /home/files ext4 defaults 0 2\n\nSave the file at the end\nYou can test by restarting the machine\n\nA: For Booting time mount. you have to provide only auto option.

I'm assuming as its flash, its closed and nothing can be done, but there must be a fix somewhere down the line!\n\nA: What process is taking all of the CPU? Sounds like the browsers aren't the root of the problem.\nYou can find out using the 'System Monitor' utility (System->Administration menu). Select the 'Processes' tab, and sort descending by CPU.

It turned out to having nothing to do with the browser at all, only that it was using up all my ram and I only had a tiny (64MB) of swap space. Once it hit that threshold it started making my computer chug.\nNot sure if this is your issue, but if you suspect it is you might try creating and adding a swap partition if the one you have is small.\nSome information on that: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nThe specs of your computer are pretty low though, so it could be a number of issues (and browsers these days go hog wild on memory and processing).\n", "Q: How to resume the upgrade of package downloads (10.04 -> 10.10) I was trying to upgrade my 10.04 machine to 10.10 via the Update Manager.\nIt was downloading the packages (was not installing it).\nSince I had to leave my place, I cancelled it in order to be able to resume it today.\nBut somehow, I don't find the upgrade option in the update manager anymore.\nAny command line alternative to this?\nI tried :\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBut it said:\nReading package lists...

The proprietary driver works fine.\n\nA: I am not sure which graphics card you have but, on the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470/1 GB DDR3 and fglrx enabled, Unity 3D works like a charm.\n\nA: With my Radeon HD5850, I had very poor performance on Unity with the proprietary drivers. However, using the new and open radeon drivers, it's lightning fast. I get a few white ... spots on the dash from time to time. They're not too annoying, and except for that, everything is perfect.\nIn other words; if you have similar card (A HD5xxx) I would strongly suggest that you do NOT install the proprietary drivers.

Everytime I start Clementine, my Unity launcher will stop hiding and will always remain on the foreground. I have tried setting \"Hide Launcher\" to \"Dodge Windows\", \"Dodge Active Window\", and to \"Autohide\", but it still doesn't hide. Now I am forced to use the \"Never\" setting, because otherwise I can't use a part of my screen.\nCan anyone tell me how I can run clementine and hide the Launcher at the same time? I really like clementine!\n\nA: Here's a workaround: select a track in the library pane in Clementine, then drag it towards the left side of the screen, 'pushing' the launcher away. The launcher should disappear, and might behave ok for a little while longer. The problem sometimes is that after this trick, it is difficult to get the launcher to appear long enough when you really want it. So the workaround for the workaround is: play around with the launcher until it works. (For instance, get into another app like Firefox, select and drag text to the Ubuntu logo in the top left corner.)\nI think the bug in Clementine happens when you drag a track to the playlist, so try double-clicking the track instead. (In fact, I get the same bug in several other apps when I try to drag and drop files or text).\n\nA: I got the same problem too. And then I did this: press Super+S to open desktop switching view, choose one of the empty desktop (not the current). Then your launcher would hide right away. Go back to your previous desktop, the same way by pressing Super+S.\nIt worked to me.\n\nA: It's some kind of bug the launcher has with many programs. When you drag-and-drop something is Clementine or Kdenlive, the launcher won't hide anymore until you close the program. Best solution I can think of is just avoid using drag-and-drop :p So just double-click in stead of drag-and-dropping.\n", "Q: Any file executed once when system starts up Is there any config file that is evaluated once, everytime operating system starts up. bashrc does not qualifies since it gets evaluated everytime a gnome terminal starts..\n\nA: cron can be of help here.\nBesides starting something on a minute,hour,day of week, month etc it also has some special operations:\n\n@reboot Run once, at startup.\n@yearly Run once a year, \"0 0 1 1 *\".\n@annually (same as @yearly)\n@monthly Run once a month, \"0 0 1 * *\".\n@weekly Run once a week, \"0 0 * * 0\".\n@daily Run once a day, \"0 0 * * *\".\n@midnight (same as @daily)\n@hourly Run once an hour, \"0 * * * *\".\n\nEditing is done from command line with the following command:\nsudo crontab -e \nat the bottom of the file (below the # m h  dom mon dow   command) you can add a line that executes what you want like so @reboot /directory/to/file will execute /directory/to/file during boot. \nJust one warning: you need to make sure that there is no output from that script or that the output is redirected to a file (or /dev/null) since there is no display for cron to send the output (and it will end the operation).\nExample\nsudo crontab -e\n\n# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)\n# \nPATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n@reboot /usr/bin/testscript\n\nand...\n\ncd /usr/bin/\nsudo vi testscript \necho \"works\" >/tmp/testing\nchmod 775 testscript\n\nNow for a reboot...\nAnd here is a working example:\nls -l /tmp/testing\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6 2011-05-29 08:34 /tmp/testing\nrinzwind@discworld:/tmp$ more /tmp/testing\nworks\n\n\nA: Beside other answers, you can put your startup (superuser) commands in /etc/rc.local.\n\nA: There are 2 places I use when I need to add \"run-once\" commands:\nOnce at every user login (be it Graphical/GDM or text/console login): ~/.profile\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*It works even if no GDM/X11/Graphical server is used.

So its not a \"true\" system start up only. But it may suit your need.\n\n*Since this is executed even in text-mode logins, its advisable NOT to place any command that requires a GDM/X11 server (like synergy daemon)\n\n*Bash is only used with text-mode logins.

So personal scripts and path to them must be world-readable and executable\n\n*Cannot be used if no GDM server is used (duh).

It seems empathy calls this service \"People Nearby\" and Windows \"People Near Me\".\nAfter some research I discovered more information: it seems the \"protocol\" is called Avahi (or Bonjour/Salut(?) by Apple) and permits a user to connect to users, printers and files on the network.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bonjour, Avahi, people nearby, people nearby... are these things different names for the same thing, i.e. to connect to \"things\" (users/printers/files) on the same network? Are these different implementations of Zeroconf?\n\n*Which IM support this kind of protocol? AIM, Trillian and Empathy support it, am I right? Which of them are usable on a smartphone (Android)? I think Trillian does and WiChat too but only for iOS.\n\n*Is there an Android app that implements a Bonjour's or Avahi's service for Instant Messaging?\n\n\nA: Bonjour is Apple's trade marked name for the Zeroconf protocols.  These protocols consist of:\n\n\n*\n\n*A method of automatically assigning IP addresses to machines on the local network when no DHCP server is available.\n\n*A method of advertising services on the local network (service discovery over multicast DNS).\n\n\nAvahi is the implementation of these protocols used by Ubuntu.\nThe People Nearby service in Empathy uses the XMPP Serverless Messaging extension, which entails advertising your presence over the local network via the standard Zeroconf service discovery protocols, and clients sending messages to each other directly instead of via a server.\nSalut is the name of the Empathy backend that implements this protocol.\nTo my knowledge, there isn't a standard multicast DNS implementation on Android, so I don't know whether many clients would implement this serverless messaging extension.\n", "Q: Users and Groups Administration tool - What do the options in User Privileges tab of Advanced Settings do? How does the \"User Privileges\" tab in the Advanced Settings of Users and Groups GUI work? I mean this window:\n\nDoes it simply add or remove the user from certain groups, or is there something else? If so, why only a few groups are represented there? I mean, how does Ubuntu/Gnome/Whatever decide which groups appear in that list? And where does the \"description\" for each \"privilege\" comes from? \nAs a side-note, Ive always been amazed of how incredibly terrible this GUI is: documentation is laughable, to say the least (click Help and see: only 3 pages, very outdated screenshots, obsolete and incomplete instructions, and not a single word on the Advanced Settings at all), also the design is completely counter-intuitive: theres no list at all of the groups a user belongs to. One must click \"Manage Groups\" and click properties for each and every group to see its users. Come on! How come such a major and ancient thing like Users and Groups Management still have no decent GUI?\n\nA: After some research, I answered my own question... Ill post here for reference, may help people with a similar question in the future:\nIve downloaded and studied the source code from gnome-system-utils package. The app itself is users-admin. And the short answer is:\nYes, this tab is only about adding and removing the user from certain groups. \nLong answer:\nThere are some checks, for example, when removing the user from the admin group, that triggers a warning about if the user is the only administrator in the system, and prevents from revoking this privilege. But, basicaly, each \"privilege\" in the list is just an alias for a group. It makes sense, since security and privileges in Linux are closely tied to a user belonging (or not) to certain groups.\nBut not every group is represented in the Privileges list, only a few. And, believe it or not, the list is hard-coded! Groups and description strings! \nBelow is a list from all the groups represented in the privileges list, as of Linux Mint 10 (= Ubuntu Maverick 10.10 in that sense). The groups names and the descriptions shown in the list are taken directly from source code, file src/users/privileges_list.c. The explanation about some of them (when descrition is not self-explanatory) are taken from this blog (a bit outdated) and  /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/users-and-groups.html (definately obsolete)\n\n\n*\n\n*adm - Monitor system logs. Group adm is used for system monitoring tasks. Members of this group can read many log files in /var/log, and can use xconsole. Historically, /var/log was /usr/adm (and later /var/adm), thus the name of the group. HELP: Perhaps policy should state the purpose of this group so users may be safely added to it, in certainty that all they'll be able to do is read logs. Wouldn't hurt to rename it 'log' either ... \n\n*admin - Administer the system. Allows members to control administrative functions on the system, such as adding programs and new user accounts (in other words, its the group that allows a user to use sudo command). UPDATE: from Ubuntu 12.04 onwards, the corresponding group is named sudo\n\n*audio - Use audio devices\n\n*cdrom - Use CD-ROM drives\n\n*cdwrite - Burn CDs / DVDs\n\n*dialout - Use modems. Full and direct access to serial ports. Members of this group can reconfigure the modem, dial anywhere, etc. \n\n*dip - Connect to Internet using a modem. The group's name stands for \"Dialup IP\". Being in group dip allows you to use tools such as pppd, pon, and poff to make dialup connections to other systems using predefined configuration file(s) in the /etc/ppp/peers directory.\n\n*fax - Send and receive faxes\n\n*floppy - Use floppy drives\n\n*fuse - Mount user-space filesystems (FUSE). Allows members to use the FUSE filesystem to mount removable media in their home folder without administrative privileges\n\n*lpadmin - Configure printers. Allows a user to add, modify, and remove printers from foomatic, cups, and possibly other printer databases.\n\n*netdev - Connect to wireless and ethernet networks. Special group used by internal communications services\n\n*plugdev - Access external storage devices automatically. Members of this group can access removable devices in limited ways without explicit configuration in /etc/fstab. This is useful for local users who expect to be able to insert and use CDs, USB drives, and so on. Since pmount (the original implementor of group plugdev) always mounts with the nodev and nosuid options and applies other checks, this group is not intended to be root-equivalent in the ways that the ability to mount filesystems might ordinarily allow. Implementors of semantics involving this group should be careful not to allow root-equivalence.\n\n*powerdev - Suspend and hibernate the computer\n\n*proc - Access /proc filesystem\n\n*scanner - Use scanners\n\n*tape - Use tape drives\n\n*usb - Use USB devices\n\n*vboxusers - Use VirtualBox virtualization solution\n\n*video - Use video devices\n\n*wheel - Be able to get administrator privileges\n\n*sambashare - Share files with the local network\n\n\nA privilege is only listed if its correspondent group exists in the system. So the following does not show here since Ubuntu do not create them by default: cdwrite, powerdev , proc, scanner, usb, video and wheel.\nGroups vboxusers (and perhaps sambashare) are only created when you install that software, giving a false impression that this list is configurable and not hard coded.\nThats kinda weird, since I can use my CD/DVD Writer, USB ports, Hibernate, Audio and Video just fine. Maybe these are obsolete groups from Debian not used by Ubuntu? Well, then what is tape doing there?\nUpdate: Video groups seems related to using the framebuffer driver for direct video access and graphic modes. As it turns out, non-root users are not allowed to use video graphics, the Xorg X server is, and the Desktop Environment, such as Gnome/Unity/KDE, use the X server. As such, /usr/bin/X is setuid as root.\nI guess this is similar with usb, cdrom and other block devices: a regular user can only indirectly access those devices configured via udev.\n", "Q: How do i back up my PGP key \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to share one pgp-key on multiple machines? \n\nI am about to upgrade my computer to 11.04.

Or to toggle hide/unhide with a keyboard shortcut? I would like to manually control when the launcher is shown or hidden. Is it possible? There is no option to \"never show launcher\", nor have I found a way to force the launcher to hide.\n\nA: If the launcher is set to auto-hide, with Super + e (mostly Windows + e) you can make the launcher show again. Havent found a way to hide the launcher through a shortcut though.\n\nA: I use unity2d and i made this script to toogle the launcher :\n#!/bin/sh\nvar=$(gsettings get com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher hide-mode)\nif [ \"$var\" = 0 ]\nthen\n    exec gsettings set com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher hide-mode 2\nelse\n    exec gsettings set com.canonical.Unity2d.Launcher hide-mode 0\nfi\n\nafter you can set a shortcut who launch this script \n\nA: You can configure it to hide automatically when not used. Launch the CompizConfig Settings Manager (package compizconfig-settings-manager), find the Ubuntu Unity Plugin there, and change the Hide Launcher setting to \"Autohide\".\n\nA: I use Cairo-Dock (not without its own set of problems) as it is far superior to the Unity launcher. What I have done for the moment is use compizconfig settings manager to enable auto-hide, in combination with the reveal mode set to 'None'. Now instead of popping up when I navigate to the edge of the screen it only pops up (annoyingly) when using 'find'. \nOf course, I really would really rather just disable the launcher altogether. And compiz too, but gnome unfortunately does not support transparencies without compiz.

I then added a new drive with Win7.  Which works fine and serves most of my needs, but I cannot now get to Linux.  I'd like  to get to Linux without messing with my Win7 MBR (e.g. installing grub on the linux drive and changing the BIOS boot order or using the Windows boot loader to get to grub).  \nI installed using 11.04 (over the existing 10.04 which may have been a mistake).  I can still get into Win7 (so no change in behaviour) but still cannot get into grub / ubuntu.\nThis may be the wrong place to ask as its a messy problem to unpick and not a simple Question with Answer, but thought I'd try my luck.\nFor more details, read on...\nBackground.\nOriginally 2 - harddisks:\n\n\n*\n\n*320GB - Vista (installed first)\n\n*160GB - Linux (10.04 upgraded over time from 8.04)- including a small swap partition\n\n\nWhich used to boot to Grub to select Windows or Linux.\nI added a new drive (SSD) and installed Windows 7 on it.  I had some trouble getting the BIOS to recognise the drive to boot from, so swapped some of the SATA cables around, which may have contributed to my later problems.\nI could now boot into Windows 7 fine, but Linux was now inaccessible.  I first installed EasyBCD to Windows and tried to auto-recognise Linux, this didn't seems to work (can't remember details unfortunately).  \nThen I used an 11.04 LiveCD and attempted to upgrade the 10.04 installation (which was an option).  Towards the end of this I encountered many errors, which seem to relate to the change from grub to grub 2 (as my 10.04 had been upgraded from originally 7 or 8).  \nI've tried formatting the Linux drive during the install and installing 11.04 in its place, which seems now to succeed, but then still cannot boot into Linux successfully.  I have also performed the steps from the Copy GRUB 2 Files from the LiveCD instructions to the point where a reboot is required.  However I then arrived at a grub prompt and couldn't see how to perform the \"Refresh the GRUB 2 menu with sudo update-grub\" step.  typing sudo update-grub at this point was not recognised.\nCurrent Situation.\nI can choose from BIOS to boot into any of the 3 drives, or from a LiveCD.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from new 120GB drive.  Windows BCP displayed.\n\n*\n\n*1a. Choose Windows 7 - boot to Windows successfully\n\n*1b. Choose Grub 2 (based on EasyBCD autodetect) - gives EXT2 error  (see pic)\n\n*1c. Choose Grub (configured on EasyBCD based on original Grub settings) - goes to Grub rescue prompt (see pic)\n\n\n*Boot from original 320GB Windows - no boot menu, loads directly into Vista\n\n*Boot from Linux 160GB drive.  Ends up at Grub rescue prompt (see pic)\nI'd rather not change the Windows 7 MBR from the Linux install given that it is my main working environment right now.  Instead I'd rather install Grub on the Linux drive and then give it priority in the BIOS boot order.  Once I can boot into Linux successfully, then I'd be open to making other changes.  Any help to get Grub working on the linux drive (pretending that the new Windows 7 disk does not exist) would be greatly appreciated\nDetails\nOutput of fdisk -l\nDisk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x2889808c\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1       18662   149902483+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda2           18663       19457     6385807    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5           18663       19457     6385806   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xfeffeeaa\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *           1       38914   312568832    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x13944bce\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *           1          13      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS\nPartition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.\n/dev/sdc2              13       14594   117115904    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\n\nA: Ok I have had progress and am a fair amount of the way there.\nI've followed the steps at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nSpecifically finding my UUID using mount and then executing the following: \nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/media/<my UUID>/boot /dev/sda\n\nI thought I had already done this, but perhaps not.\nNow setting my boot drive in BIOS as the Linux drive displays the boot loader and allows me to boot into Ubuntu 11.04.

There should be an notification looking for your attention, but I'm not sure where it appears in Kubuntu. In lieu of that you can use:\nsudo jockey-text\n\nThis should get you up to speed with your drivers, if you aren't already.\nFor the dual monitor you may be able to use 'Monitors' in the 'Control Center' to make it dual screen (rather than cloned.) It is possible, like nvidia, that you'll have to use ATI's software, however.

Is there a way I can share my lan internet connection through my wifi when I has an mesh connection from my android through the Open Garden Wifi Tethering App(A WiFi Tether AP Mesh Client)?\nLink to: Open Garden Wifi Tethering App\n\nA: yes you can open network manger from the right side in the panel then click edit connection you will see all connection choose wireless and click add new set everything like ssd and password then go to ipv4 setting make the method \"share to other computer\"\n\nA: Although software solutions exist, by far the simplest way is to buy a WiFi router which can be be had for less than $20 if you shop around. The only configuration required may be to clone the MAC address of your PC's Ethernet port in the router to allow the router to connect via your broadband connection. Many routers have an option to clone the MAC address for you. Just plug the modem into the WAN port of the router and your PC into one of the 4 available LAN ports.

I think creating a .desktop-file for python2.6 would not really help if I want to use different icons for each window. \nAny idea? \nPymol: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/pymol \n(Python games only showing python icon, but not game icon: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/777417 )\n\nA: As of  2011-07-06, this has been fixed. \n\nA: I tried today to create a proper Pymol launcher in Unity (under Oneiric) and modified the pymol.desktop file in (/usr/share/applications) as followed :\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=PyMOL Molecular Graphics System\nGenericName=Molecular Modeller\nComment=Model molecular structures and produce high-quality images of them\nType=Application\nExec=pymol\nIcon=pymol\nMimeType=chemical/x-pdb\nCategories=Education;Science;Chemistry;\nStartupNotify=false\nStartupWMClass=Tk\n\nThe most important part is the  \"StartupWMClass=Tk\". While doing so, the Tk control panel of Pymol is always linked to the Pymol icon in the Unity launcher.\nBasically, this \"StartupWMClass\" explains to Unity what should be the name of the windows that would appear after clicking on the launcher.\n(I figured out what was the name of the Tk control panel while running xprop|grep X11_WM_CLASS in a terminal)\nBut this only solves half of the problem because the main graphical window is still linked to an icon referred by a question mark which appears after invoking the program and I couldn't guess under which name refers to this main window.\n", "Q: How to prevent an application from showing up in the Unity panel?

It doesn't seem to be working, sadly. I think the issue is that whichever user is running doesn't have the right permission to create files. I've been going round in circles with this, though - I thought I had set the permissions for the /var/www (it's testing only so I'm not worried about security) to 777.

If that works, paste <?php file_put_contents('test','test'); ?> into a file and run it, see if it does the same thing.\nIf it outputs the file too, then it must be a problem with your script.\n", "Q: Why can't I run a program I manually installed in /opt/?

You need to make the file executable by you. It's not exactly much trouble. It's one command: \nsudo chmod +x filename. \n\nHowever, teeworlds is in the repositories. Is there a very good reason why you want to install it manually? You should always install software from the repositories whenever possible. It's much easier, faster, more reliable and secure. \nsudo apt-get install teeworlds\n\nOr click here: teeworlds .\n\nA: what you done is right every thing owned by root can't accessible from other user you have always to change the owner of files or give permissions to read and write the folder for other user opt folder is owned by root so you can't create new folder to it without permissions ...\n\nA: runable files should have 755 permissions with root owner (see ls -l output in /usr/bin).

This prompts them to make sites which can be accessed only in IE. Though I have dual-boot system I boot into Windows only once in several days. I don't want to boot into Windows just to check my internet usage(yes, it is my ISP's site - http://selfcare.sdc.bsnl.co.in/). The site does not allow me to enter my username and password in Firefox/Chrome in Ubuntu. When I take my mouse pointer over it, it just keeps circling! And now it has started showing Bad Gateway. The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. Ironically it seems to use Apache/2.0.52 (Red Hat) Server.  So there they need Linux! Is there any way out for such issues other than installing Windows on a Virtual PC?\n\nA: Well you have several ways:\nFIREFOX Addon - \n\n\n*\n\n*User-Agent Switcher \n\n*User Agent Overrider\n\n*User Agent Switcher\nCHROME Addons - \n\n\n*\n\n*User-Agent Switcher for Chrome\n\n*User-Agent Switcher for Google Chrome\n\n*User-Agent Switcher\nMANUALLY\n\n\n*\n\n*CHROME - Chrome has an about page to CHECK if you have changed your User Agent about: and other options like about:labs, about:memory, about:hang, about:plugins and many others that depending on your version they could be available or not. But for the question at hand this option is not yet in any of the about pages i have found. To have it manually in chrome you need to start chrome with the option user-agent. For example google-chrome --user-agent=\"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)\" which will open Chrome like it were IE6. The IE User Agents are from the Firefox option above.\n\n\nThe list for most (Maybe all) User Agents can be found in this page \n (There are other pages actually but this is the best i found) \nYou can also make sure the site works with IE or any other browser that you want to compare with by testing it on web pages like http://browsershots.org and http://www.webpagetest.org that can test out the compatibility with the site with each browser and show a small screenshot of how they look.\n\nA: Install Opera.It allows logging into BSNL portal.\nRegards.\n\nA: I am not aware of any way to actually emulate another browser, but you can install extensions for your browser that will pretend like as if it's the other browser (even though the browser's internals do not change).\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/\n\n\n*Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon\n\n\n*Konqueror has one builtin:\n\nMost websites check the browser by what is known as a \"User Agent String\". This string (or text) provides many details about the browser, renderer (the thing that displays the website), OS, and the versions of them. For example, here are a few user agent strings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox 16, 32-bit build running under a 64-bit processor, on windows 8:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:16.0.1) Gecko/20121011 Firefox/16.0.1\n\n\n*Internet Explorer 10, on windows 7:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)\n\nMost websites either \"parse\" the strings (i.e. convert the strings into code) or just use pre-parsed versions of the strings given by the browser.\nSo if  the User Agent String is edited (like the extensions I mentioned above do), the browser can trick the website to pretend like as if it's actually another browser, or running on another OS.\n\nA: You can try to install the user-agent-switcher extension for firefox.  \n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/\n\nThen, you can try to change the user-agent to Internet Explorer.\nThe author states that it's not guaranteed to work at all sites as there are many different methods of detecting the browser type.\nI've used it in a few sites myself where i was facing this kind of problem and it helped me.\nAs for the second part of the problem, the message:\n\nBad Gateway.

Its the weirdest thing or so I thought until I found that it has happened before.\nI tried to use testdisk to rebuild the MBR but instead it deleted the partition, but not the data which its currently in a 100GB or so portion of unallocated disk space.\nTestdisk says it can't restore the partition, no problem I dont care about windows but I need to get those files back.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: I disagree with the comment that a lost partition is lost data. Partitions will lose you your filenames but your files should be safe if they're in a protected, unallocated space on your disk.\nI suggest you run something like PhotoRec (part of testdisk) over the unpartitioned space. You can do this from within Ubuntu fairly safely because there's no chance (that I can see) that you're going to accidentally overwrite your old data.\nFailing that there are other tools. I had a very positive experience with Ontrack EasyRecovery Professional about a decade ago. Saved my bacon but it wasn't cheap.\n\nA: Not much, if you're confident in the size of the partitions you can recreate them and get your data back, though I wouldn't do that without backing up the entire image first. This really isn't an Ubuntu question.

The problem was simply that the devices would get bogged down by the heavy transfer, some sort of buffer overflow would occur, and the device would panic or reboot. Not to say that this is explicitly a 3rd party firmware problem, but checking that your router is actually capable of handling that kind of throughput may be where to start.\n\nI personally changed routers a few months ago from a similar issue (while not specifically for media streaming I chose the WHR-G301N, running 3rd party firmware on it) and currently have no issues. Routers are cheap, perhaps purchasing a better router and replacing your two-router setup with one good router would be worth the price if it saves you time and future headaches. Since you have Tomato on the other routers already you could use them as mini-servers or something, so they wouldn't \"go to waste\".\n\nA: You might try reducing the transmission queue length on the interfaces in the middle of the \"chain\"- that is, the Tomato router's ethernet and wifi interfaces. \nThe relevant command is similar to:\nip link set eth0 txqueuelen 64\n\nwhere you replace 'eth0' with the interface name and '64' with the desired queue length in packets. \nThis is to prevent bufferbloat, which can impact network performance similarly to the problems you are encountering. You may or may not be experiencing bufferbloat, but reducing your TX queue length will not hurt anything and it can be easily set back to the original value (default is 1000).\n\nA: Run wireshark and see what the traffic actually is.\n", "Q: Select specific Twitter in Gwibber without seeing the rest i follow How can i configure Gwibber to show me only 1 Twitter of the group i follow.

Please guide my on how to set up a LAN between these two machines.\nIs there any GUI  program to do this instead of Terminal? I have the ethernet cable connected to a router which in turn is connected to my DSL modem to provide internet access to both my PC's.\n\nA: If both are directly connected to the router and can access internet, then they already are in LAN. Maybe you want to share files and folders, right?\nIf so, its easy: right-click any folder you want to share, go to \"Sharing Options\", check the \"Share this folder\" box, choose a share name, and youre basically done.\nIf Samba support is not already installed by default, Ubuntu will offer you to install it on-the-fly. Just accept it. Oh, by the way: \"Samba\" is what enables Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) to share folders and files in a LAN, using the same protocol used by Windows. Meaning any folders you share will also be accessible by Windows machines in your LAN (if there is any)\n\nA: I'm a little unsure how far you want the guide to go. But if you simply want Internet connection / local file sharing:\nWith the computer you are connecting to your router:\nClick on your network indicator (top right of your screen...) and select 'Edit Connections'. In the wired tab hit the button 'Add'. Give the connection a helpful name, and under the 'IPv4 Settings' tab choose \"Shared to other computers\" in the drop down 'Method' box. Save the chances and close the connection editor. Connected this computer to the Internet.\nConnected up the second machine. On the first 'internet'ed' machine just make sure (using the network indicator) that the Wired Connection you've just created is chosen.\nThis GUI method should be able to cope with most more-complex setups too.\n\nA: Test this:\nOpen a terminal\nRun\nsudo su \napt-get update\napt-get install samba samba-common samba-common-bin smbclient system-config-samba\napt-get clean\nsystem-config-samba\n\nSystem-config-samba is a graphical user interface for creating, modifying, and deleting samba shares and users.\n", "Q: Ubuntu account suddenly keeps quitting on 11.04 I have been running Ubuntu on my Dell Vostro 1520 for a few months, and the latest 11.04 version of Ubuntu since it was released.\nAs of a few hours ago, my account keeps quitting every couple of minutes. The OS is still running, but I am returned to the login screen, and when I log in, no applications or documents are open.\nIs there a standard procedure I should follow to troubleshoot this?\nWhen it quits I typically have Gedit, Google Chrome and the Terminal open, with a few tabs in Terminal running rails server, rails console, etc.\nMany thanks.\n\nA: \nIs there a standard procedure I should follow to troubleshoot this?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You start by looking at log files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit super and start typing log file viewer. Logs ending on a dot and a digit are older logs. Most of these logs are specific to certain events (like boot.log only is useful when dealing with starting and stopping your system). syslog is a log file that shows system errors so is always a good start. \n\n*Then there is .xsession-errors in you home directory. Messages related to your GDM sessions are stored in this file. grep error ~/.xsession-errors will show lines that contain an error. There might be something useful in here. If you find anything useful/related to your problem search for it on askubuntu.com or google (most of the errors you find will have happend to others).\n\n\n*If it is random it might be related to your graphics card crashing your X server. Check that you have installed the recommended driver version and not the newest or an experimental driver.

Just make sure you do this by de-selecting the 'static application switcher' first, or else you'll get binding conflicts.\n\nA: I found a good, simple solution. Now the windows key + tab rotates fast between all open windows, also those by the same application. Alt + tab rotates between all windows as before. The windows key still opens the launcher, however windows key + tab does not rotate down the launcher.\nWhat I did: Installed and started CCSM as mentioned above. In the Windows part I selected \"Ring Switcher\" og \"Application Switcher\" and did not deselect any. I chose to reslove conflicts in the popup window and selected the leftmost option in all questions. This worked both on my stationary PC and laptop. \n", "Q: Whenever I use ALT-TAB, Firefox display freezes I installed Ubuntu 2011.04 from scratch a few hours ago. At first Firefox was working perfectly. Then I selected \"Static application switcher\" in the Compiz configuration.\nFrom that time, whenever I press ALT-TAB, Firefox's display is frozen. As hinted by the changing mouse cursor, I can click on link and select text, but I can not see it.\nIf I restart Firefox or simply unmaximize/remaximize it, the problem is gone, until the next ALT-TAB.\nWhat's going wrong? How to go back to the deafult (non Compiz?) application switcher?\nNote: I am using the proprietary ATI driver Ubuntu proposed me to install.\n\nA: I would have liked to really solve the problem, but meanwhile here is how to avoid the problematic consequence: Select the Compiz \"Static application switcher\".\n\nA: This is an answer if you didn't check your settings correctly. Static application switcher is a watered down version of application switcher. It is generally more stable than the latter as well. When I switched from static application switcher to the more powerful application switcher I started observing the problems you mentioned: windows became locked until I resized them. The problem went away as soon as I disabled application switcher (which is a shame because it is so cooler). \nWord of caution: re-enabling static application switcher made my system totally unresponsive to the point where I had to hold down the power button. Afterwards, however, everything returned to normal, after reboot\n", "Q: Is it possible to read/write software reviews in different languages? Does anyone know if it possible to write/display a review in a different language than your own primary one in the Software Center?\n\nA: You can logout, choose your own user again, but on the bottom of the screen set another language to use, it will change the prefered language when the Software Center look for revisions, but you may notice that the whole system will use that dictionary and to get back to your default language you will need to logout again and change that language.\nSummarising, it's still a lacking feature and logging out and in isn't the most convenient way to read revisions in other languages. Hope they'll include this feature in Oneiric's Software Center!\n\nA: Maybe you can launch it from a terminal with\nLC_ALL=lang software-center\n\nThat way, everything should be set to a different locale.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to write review in other language as long as you can type them. Software Center can also display reviews in other languages, at least I saw come Chinese reviews in some software infos.\n\nBut until now, you cannot choose to \"only\" view reviews written by a certain language.\n\nA: Actually this is not possible from inside software-center. The only way right now is to create a seperate user and pick the language you want at the GDM-Login.\n\nA: If you go to system settings?keyboard>layouts, you can add another language keyboard layout. An icon will appear in the panel which you can use to change layouts. If you change the layout when you are ready to type the review that language will be used for what you write. This is what happens when I change the layout to Greek when writing this answer:\nαβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω\nYou will continue typing in that language until you change back to GBr (English)\nRegards.\n", "Q: Ati cards need mesa 7.11. Where can i find it Ati radeon cards Require Natty/11.04 and Modesetting Only\nThese cards should work with Ubuntu Natty/11.04, however you will need a more recent version of Mesa (7.11.x) than Natty's default (7.10.x) to get 3D acceleration.

The radeon drive is still not working as he is working in Windows, but i think there is hope.\n\nA: Mesa 7.11 is extremely new - you should read that as unstable.\nThe ubuntu X developers have a PPA to allow for testing of the latest software which includes mesa 7.11.\nYou should read their upfront notice first.\n\"Packages for those who think development versions, experimental and unstable are for old ladies. We want our crack straight from upstream git! Well, straight, we want it built and packaged so we don't need to know what we're doing, except that we will break our X and put our computers on fire.\"\n\nA: I've checked and do not see anything greater than 7.10 in the current Ubuntu repositories.  Additionally, when I look to see if there is a PPA for 7.11, I note that it is for testing and very new.

I'm getting sick and tired of VLC. The issues are too many to mention in detail, but generally: bugs (ballooning out of memory on fake/exotic movies, leftover windows, many others) and the ergonomics that would be more appropriate for a 1995 application.\nAre there any good alternatives? Things that are important to me: resources usage footprint, formats supported, ergonomics.\n\nA: GNOME Media Player \nGNOME media player is a fairly simple media player that fits well into the GNOME desktop.\n\nIt runs on multiple backends (vlc, gstreamer and xine) which means it can play almost every media format. By default it tries to pick the backend that works best for what you are playing. It doesn't have as many features as some other players but it has a simple interface and from my experience plays well.\n\nA: If you are fine with Movie Player/Totem (Ubuntu's default media player) or Banshee, you can simply install the codec packages (and their dependencies) to play all the formats:\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3 gstreamer0.10-pitfdll gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse\n\nPS I use this instead of the ubuntu-restricted-extras because I want only the codec packages. The restricted meta-package contains some fonts, OpenJDK and codecs.\nEDIT I checked just now, ASS/SSA issue I mentioned before is no longer applicable.\n\nA: smplayer (based on mplayer) plays all formats known to mankind and is easy to use. It also has unique features such as remembering the position in a movie when you close it.\n\nA: mplayer is at least as good as vlc. There is a terminal option \"mplayer\" equal to \"cvlc\" and different GUIs on top of it.\n\nA: Xine is very good player, I prefer mplayer though \n\nA: I've recently switched to miro version 4 ( http://www.getmiro.com/download/for-ubuntu/ ) from VLC, for aesthetic reasons, and I'm liking it.

Here is my sketch on how to do it. The other code stays the same as in my earlier answer. One just has to replace the randomizeLabel subroutine and insert this code instead:\nuse bigint;\n\n# Kinda large primes\n$p = 338047573;   # Any pair of large primes will suffice here...\n$q = 4182249941;  #+...as long as they fullfill the congruence check below\n$rand = 7;    # Seed for the random number generator (x_0 in the wiki)\n\nsub errMsg {\n    $dialog = Gtk2::MessageDialog->new($window, 'destroy-with-parent', 'error', 'ok', $_[0]);\n    $dialog->signal_connect (response => sub { exit 1; });\n    $dialog->run;\n}\n\n# Check congruence 3 mod 4 (for quadratic residue)\nif( ($p-3)%4 == 0 ) { errMsg('Error: Variable p is ill choosen.'); }\nif( ($q-3)%4 == 0 ) { errMsg('Error: Variable q is ill choosen.'); }\n# Note: For large cycle lengths gcd(φ(p-1), φ(q-1)) should also be small,...\n#+...where φ is Euler's totient function but this is not checked here\n\n# Compute Modulus in Blum Blum Shub\n$M = $p*$q;\n\nsub randomizeLabel { # This does the actual randomization\n    $min = int($entry1->get_text); $max = int($entry2->get_text); # Boundaries for the desired random range from the input filed of the GUI (included for convenience when modifying the script - not used here)\n\n    # Blum Blum Shub pseudo random number generator\n    $rand = ($rand*$rand) % $M;\n\n    # Here you have to extract the bits and shift them in range\n    $randout = $rand & (2**6-1); # Change this line.

Right now the input for minimum and maximum is unused.\n\nA: I don't know any software. Google didn't come up with something either. Guess this is too simple a problem.

It's in the middle of my primary monitor. When I press Esc it disappears. \nIt started to show up the other day for no apparent reason. It has kept showing up after every login since then.\nWhat does it do and how do I get ridd of it?\n\nA: This looks like Gnome-Do (or Synapse with a Gnome-Do theme).\nIf it's Gnome-Do, you can prevent it from opening on startup by pressing the down arrow in the top-right corner and going to preferences.  Under the \"General\" tab, you can choose \"Hide window on first launch\" to prevent this box from opening on startup.\n\nOr, if you don't use Gnome Do, you can safely uninstall it from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: That would look to be Gnome-Do.  If not needed, ensure that it is not set to start upon startup.\n", "Q: Which should I recommend, 10.04 vs 11.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release? \n\nI've been running 10.04 for a while now.  I use it for development purposes and recreation, and I love it.  My friend recently had to reformat his computer because he got a virus.  Naturally, he is looking to try out Ubuntu (instead of his Windows 7).My friend would only use this for recreation/writing papers/etc., and he is not that tech savy.  \nI am torn because I know 10.04 would be more stable for him, but the 11.04 desktop looks interesting.\nFrom your experience, are new features in 11.04 worth the instability?  For you users of 11.04, how stable is it?  Does it have noticeable problems? \nI know it's a matter of preference, so I'm searching for opinions.\nShould I recommend 10.04 or 11.04?  \nThanks for your responses!\n\nA: I was on 10.04 for a year not transitioning to 10.10 even to try it out. Stability in 10.04 is rock solid as you say. But if a guy was coming from Win7 he'd probably like the Unity Shell in 11.04. It's awesome! I just moved to 11.04 three days back and I find it pretty much stable. If your friend does run into trouble with the Unity Interface, he can always fall back to the regular Gnome DE\n\nA: If it's a \"legacy\"(older) system I would try the 10.04 LTS version! For some reason 11.04 seems to be very \"finicky\" about what system it's installed on! I've noticed that the releases become more stable as the developers have time to fix the issues that crop up with the release.\n\nA: i have had nothing but trouble since upgrading from 10.04 to 11.04. it caused (or coincided with) massive hard drive failures -- multiple OS and DATA drives on separate machines, and i lost my NVIDIA graphics card in the mess (hardware failure).\none of my systems does not even allow me to \"Save As ...\" in any program, nor does it allow me the ability to upload to various key websites.\nagain -- it could be my hardware, or it could be the software, or it could be a combination. either way, it all started happening when i tried to run the Upgrade function.\n\nA: I personally found 10.04 to be much more stable as compared to 11.04. The latter strangely seems to hang every few days (forcing me to press Ctrl-Alt-F1 and do some command line-fu) and sometimes even logs me out automatically. So I'd definitely recommed 10.04 to a new, not-so-tech-savvy user.\n", "Q: Bluetooth doesn't start up properly when I start up Basically, Bluetooth via my USB dongle doesn't work until after I manually /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart a few times.

Can someone give me hand on fixing this?\nI am using Ubuntu Classic for my session\n\nA: I just checked mine, after having seen your posted pic, and found that mine are the same.  I did not notice this in Unity, but started experimenting with the Classic interface today.\n\nA: Sounds like I'll need to file a bug report.

Some other command to run?  It was using 100% of the CPU, and I need to finish my dissertation, so I just forcibly turned off the computer, but if it happens again, I'd like to be prepared.  Note:  I also renice'd the process to 19 and it 'took' -- i.e. it responded that the process was now at nice 19 and was at nice 0.  However, it was still using 100% of the cpu.\nBackground: A friend was using the computer, so I haven't yet cycled through the history to see if there was anything malicious, but it crashed when he started firefox and it returned to ESPN's fantasy baseball website -- not a place I would expect flash malware to grow...

Also, even if you do, you should note that the YouTube API is fairly restrictive in what those apps would be allowed to do anyway, and you will likely only be able to get the low-quality versions of any videos, even those which may have 1080p video and 5.1 audio in the original upload.\n\nA: I don't know if it'll meet your precise requirements, but have you given Minitube a shot? It's a very nice application that should go a long way towards helping you. Here is a link to the PPA's page: https://launchpad.net/~neversfelde/+archive/minitube\n\nA: Actually the default Movie Player (aka Totem) is capable of doing that:\n\nBut I have to admit, that it is not very advanced and does not meet all your needs. But there might be a lot of plugins out there, since it is a quite popular default player.\n\nA: vlc  \nThe stable VLC in *ubuntu 14.04 is version 2.1. To get the latest stable version: \n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media&&sudo apt-get update&&sudo apt-get install vlc\n\n\ncan do this via a specific addon.  \nLook up the page for instructions - among others:\nInstallation:\n\n\n*\n\n*put the file in the vlc /lua/playlist folder, by default:\n\n*Linux (all users): /usr/lib/vlc/lua/playlist/\n\n*Linux (current user): ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/playlist/\n\n\nHow to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the URL of the youtube video or playlist (must contain \"list=PL...\")\n\n*Start VLC, press Ctrl+N, paste the url then click on \"Play\" (or Alt+P then Enter), the video /playlist should start\n\n\n\n(In 'Media', 'Save Playlist to File' and may open it later in VLC.)\n\nNow I see that this answer was already given here, although with a different link.\n\nAlso, I find interesting an application that runs in the terminal, Youtube Viewer (youtube-viewer) and uses mplayer or mpv to play the youtube video.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install youtube-viewer\n\nMore here.\nBy default it uses mplayer. To make it use mpv instead, run youtube-viewer --video-player=mpv. So, a desktop file with this content may be useful:\n[Desktop Entry]\nExec=bash -c 'youtube-viewer --video-player=mpv'\nIcon=youtube-viewer\nName[en_US]=Youtube Viewer\nName=Youtube Viewer\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\n\nWhen running the program, a terminal window opens, saying:\n=>> Search for YouTube videos (:h for help)\n> ^J> \n\nRunning :h for help, you get a lot of options, amongst which\n[playlist-url]    : display videos from a playlistURL\n:playlist=ID      : display videos from a playlistID\n\nThis means that just pasting a playlist's URL will show the playlist in the terminal as a list. (Alternatively, instead of the whole URL, :playlist=ID, where ID is the last part of the URL (after list=). Then, to play it in the video player, type the numbers of the playlist items: for a whole playlist of 10 items, 1-10, etc.\n\nIf you really don't care about the video and want mainly the audio, you can take a look at this question on how to play only audio of youtube videos.\nThe idea is to use mps-youtube, similar to Youtube Viewer, but audio only. To see a playlist there, just type pl <url or id>. Then similarly, something like 1-10, and the sound will be played.\nYoutube Viewer can be also used with audio only by adding a corresponding argument for mpv player: youtube-viewer --video-player=mplayer -novideo.\nTo use VLC without video, the arguments are: \ncvlc --vout none <URL>\ncvlc --no-video <URL> \n\n\nNOTE that for some reason not all youtube playlists can be accessed in this way. \n\nA: TOMAHAWK Player\nhttp://www.tomahawk-player.org\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tomahawk/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tomahawk \n\n\n*\n\n*Take a look at the screencast:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Qb-gVIPWWcc \n\n*For more detailed direction see:\nHow to build Tomahawk on Ubuntu 12.04 (wiki.tomahawk-player.org/mediawiki/index.php/Building_Ubuntu_Binary_on_Precise_(12.04)).\nNote:\nPhonon-VLC is the recommended audio backend for Ubuntu as there are known issues with others. So please make sure the package phonon-backend-vlc is installed rather than phonon-backend-gstreamer.\n\nA: There is a video and music player called MiniTube. It can play Youtube videos and playlists and is very lightweight. Just search for it in the Software Center.\nIf this doesn't work, you could also try the XBMC Media Center. XBMC plays almost every music/video file and it supports YouTube videos/playlists. \nNote: XBMC is a full Media Center. It is a very big and powerful application. I think that you are searching for a more lightweight player.\n\nA: If your only care about the listening to music, you can do it right on the video's page by using this Firefox add-on. That'll give you all the power of the actual youtube player(with caching etc.) and enjoy the music.\nIt works for playlists as well :)\nFirefox Add-on: Youtube Audio\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-uS/firefox/addon/youtube-audio/\nIt disables the video on the player window with a simple add-on toggle. Video can be enabled by toggling again and refreshing. Simple enough.\n\nA: http://www.youqueue.co.uk Music Queuer is a website which will allow you to play lists of you tube videos non stop, you can create a playlist of youtube videos or soundcloud songs and play them all as if they are in one player. The website indexes music via categories so that it is more music orientated in an album artist fashion.\n\nA: One to look out for is Miro if you haven't already tried. The reason why I am not saying install it is the youtube and other features that require flash are presently not working in Ubuntu 11.10 but I expect there to be a future update that fixes it soon. \nJake\n\nA: If it really is music videos you are only interested in, musictube might be the right application for you.

Rebooting seems to be the only option in this situations. Therefore, I needed to go to console (through CTRL+ALT F1) and need to reboot the machine. \nPlease let me know a solution for this problem.  \n\nA: That's possibly an issue with Adobe Flash. I've especially had problems when switching between fullscreen and normal view and OSD (On Screen Display). Even debugging with strace locked up the GUI with the cursor being the only moving thing on the screen.\nIf you've running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, consider installing the 64-bit version of Flash. Although it's still in the \"testing\" stage, I find it more stable than the 32-bit version of Flash on a 64-bit system. See the question Flash player for 11.04 64bit for an how-to on installing Flash 64-bit.\nInstead of rebooting the machine, you can kill the GUI too (to be precise: killing all programs in the current virtual console): Alt + SysRq + R.

Why is there no Unity support for Lucid Lynx?\nThe newer versions of Ubuntu are too buggy  - the LTS version is well supported.\nWhy does Canonical not work on any new features as Unity for this current LTS release?\n\nA: Updates for old distributions are generally limited to security fixes rather than new features.  The long term support releases are really intended for people who value stability over features, and replacing core components of the desktop runs counter to that.\nAs Unity-2D did not exist at the time Ubuntu 10.04 was released, you shouldn't expect to see it pushed as an update.

I recently set up a new computer with Ubuntu 11.04 amd64, set up as a desktop. I hadn't got around to setting up an email client to read system mail, and I was curious what unread mail might have built up. I was surprised to find that /var/spool/mail was empty, that /etc/aliases did not exist, and that neither exim4 nor any other mail transfer agent (MTA) was installed.\nMy previous computer had exim4-light installed, and I had reconfigured it a few times, but I don't remember installing it. I had started with Ubuntu 8.04, and upgraded it in place with each release as they were released, until 11.04. I'm wondering if exim4-light was installed by default with some earlier release of Ubuntu, or if it was installed as a dependency of something else I installed.\n(I'm also wondering whether to bother installing an MTA, as perhaps checking routine system mail was a waste of time better spent playing Minecraft, but that's probably a subjective question.)\n\nA: Default MTA for Ubuntu is Postfix. You still to install it. Exim is still in the repo's. It sounds like you probably installed a package which pulled Exim in as a dependency.\n", "Q: \"Caps Lock on\" message is shown for too long. How can I make it disappear sooner? The \"Caps Lock on\" warning message is shown for too much time on Ubuntu 11.04. \nCould anyone tell me how can I reduce the time this message is displayed for, please? \n\nA: You probably use Pinguy OS, right? Pinguy OS comes with some Compiz settings which display NotifyOSD notifications for caps lock, num lock, etc.\nAnyway, even if that's not the case, you can get NotifyOSD to be displayed for a shorter period of time by installing the patched NotifyOSD by Leolik (by default, NotifyOSD doesn't support setting the amount of time the notification is displayed) using the commands below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:leolik/leolik \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\npkill notify-osd\n\nAs far as I know, the script to display NotifyOSD notifications for caps lock has a NotifyOSD timeout value set so there shouldn't be anything else to do. However, if you use some other way to display NotifyOSD notifications for caps lock, make sure the script uses \"--expire-time=VALUE\" so the time they are displayed is less then 10 seconds (that's default).\nFor more info about the patched NotifyOSD, see: Configurable NotifyOSD Bubbles For Ubuntu 11.04: Move, Close On Click, Change Colors And More\n", "Q: Splash screen doesn't show on boot Actually, that's slightly misleading, but titles ought to be simple.

What you might have an issue with is partitioning on this device. Consider using parted to partition this device, and see if the size of the device changes. If this LUN is going to be deployed with LVM+DM-Multipath, consider splitting this one LUN into smaller LUNs, which will allow for a normal MSDOS partition table, instead of (GPT) GUID partition table, and then simply adding all LUNs to the same volume group under LVM. This is a more sane approach, and makes life easier in the long run. On larger servers with several hundred LUNs we routinely take this approach to simplify administration, and allow for traditional partitioning, instead of using GPT.\n", "Q: How do I remove Dolphin and all of its dependencies? i'm running ubuntu 11.04 with unity.

I did not change any font settings.\nI happen to also read Japanese, it mostly displays fine but the 社 character (meaning \"company\", a widely-used character) is sometimes displayed using its archaic form, which can not be seen anymore except in temples and old places.\nSo why use it in Ubuntu? I guess it is a bug with this font? How to fix it?\nSee below, green-circled is good, red-circled is bad:\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only Firefox and Libre Office seem to display the character properly.\n\n*This character used to show fine on older Ubuntus, but on the contrary the \"直\" had the same problem at that time, and it is solved now.\n\n\nA: It just looks like your window title font uses an older font.  All you need to do is goto System -> Appearance -> Fonts and change your Window Title Font to the same ones as your actual application font.\nYou may also associate your prettier kanji font as a family of your current windows title font alias in fonts.conf under /etc/fonts/fonts.conf\neg. \n<alias>\n        <family>sans-serif</family>\n        <prefer>\n                <family>Ubuntu</family>\n                <family>Your Japanese Font</family>\n                  .....\n                <the rest of previous defined family fonts>\n        </prefer>\n</alias>\n\nThis way font system will default to your preferred Kanji font when the code page is missing in your original font.\nBy the way, that's not century old character, it's just a font type.  It's like saying using Times New Roman is wrong because it's used in Roman times and centuries old.  The 社 character can be written with both 示 or ⺭ on the side.  All you need to change it is use another font, and that's the way it is in the rest of CJK languages as well.\nSame page on my computer, which uses English US as default locale (even though I am Taiwanese).

To correctly display Unicode text using these code points, it is necessary to know what language is being used.\nThis usually either comes from the locale or through explicit tagging of the text, or guessing from the context.  I assume you're using an English locale, so only the other two options can be relied on.  Presumably the tagging exists in one part of the web page you were viewing and not in the other, leading to the two different glyph choices.\nI can't embed HTML demonstrating language tagging on this site, but if you create a web page with the following content and view it in Firefox, you should see the effect:\n<p>&#x793e; (no language tagging)</p>\n<p lang=\"ja\">&#x793e; (Japanese)</p>\n<p lang=\"zh-CN\">&#x793e; (Simplified Chineese)</p>\n<p lang=\"zh-TW\">&#x793e; (Traditional Chinese)</p>\n\nIn Firefox, you should see both glyphs despite the same code point being used in each paragraph.\n\nA: [sorry, I‘ve no rights to comment yet.]\n1) The “archaic” version, the one with 示 on the left is NOT a modern Chinese variant of that character. Neither in simplified, nor in traditional Chinese. – So, the problem is/was not like the title indicates, that Natty showed a Chinese font/variant/character.\nI’m 100% sure for simplified Chinese, but only 98% for traditional (but I checked my dictionaries...).\n2) Unicode does NOT use the same codepoints for all “means-the-same” CJK characters. Especially traditional and simplified Chinese use different codepoints, where the characters differ (otherwise not, of course). – This regularly goes so far that Unicode includes additional variants of characters that are half-way between traditional and simplified, but not used anywhere, except under confusion... ;-) (example: 說 说 説).\nIt is true, that Japanese and Chinese use different variants of some characters, which do not have different codepoints in Unicode.\n3) the html-test-snippet from James’ answer is online here. I corrected the Japanese language tag, which should be “ja”, not “jp”. – It shows the same glyph on my computer.\n4) I would like to know the name of the offending font.

It seems that the logrotate script for denyhosts tries to execute /etc/denyhosts.conf as a shell script to access the configuration variables.\nWhile your configuration file is fine for denyhosts itself, it causes the logrotate script to fail.  It looks like the problem has been fixed for the 11.10 release but the fix has not yet been released as an update for 11.04.\nYou should be able to work around the problem by removing the spaces before and after the equals sign on each line of your /etc/denyhosts.conf file.\n\nA: The popularity contest mail is a known bug in 10.10, still not fixed in 11.10 - run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest\nto fix it.\nRegards\nJohn\n", "Q: How can I do these things in Unity? there are a few things that I used to do regularly with the \"Ubuntu Classic\" interface and I can't figure out how to do them with the Unity interface (provided it is possible to do them at all):\n\n\n*\n\n*open a file at a specific location: I used to type Alt+F2 then type the complete path to the file (with tab completion) and then hitting Enter would just open the file. It seems to me that there is no way to do the same thing in Unity. Searching for the filename is not really an option as there may be multiple files with the same name in different locations.\n\n*single click window selection: thanks to the windows list applet in the panel, I could switch from one window to the other (within a workspace) with a single click. Can I do this in Unity? it seems to me that this is not possible.\n\n*single click workspace switch: thanks to the workspace applet in the panel I could switch to a different workspace with a single click or move a window to another workspace very easily by dragging it in the workspace applet. In Unity I have to move the cursor on the left border, wait that the lancher pops up, click on the workspace switcher, wait that the workspaces pop up and the I have to double-click on the ws I want. This is waaaay to slow. Any other option?\nThanks\nalfredo\n\nA: The easiest way to achieve all of these in Unity is to run gnome-panel. You can add the panel in your startup applications to make it run in each session.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This is achieved automatically by running gnome-panel.\n\n*This can be achieved by adding the 'Workspace Switcher' applet to your panel.\n\n*This can be achieved by adding the 'Window List' applet to your panel.\nYou can decide how many panels you want and where to have them to suit your workflow best.\n\nA: If you install compizconfig-settings-manager you can fiddle with the settings to get certain things to work.  For example, I like being able to switch workspaces using the mouse's scroll wheel (with the cursor over the desktop); this can be enabled in the Viewport Switcher module.  On my netbook (no mouse) I prefer to stick to keyboard shortcuts; these work quite well in Unity.\nAs for opening files, that seems like a bug - I've just noticed that if you hit Alt+F2 and start entering the path to a file, it appears to be working (once you've typed /home/ it shows all the folders in /home/; once you get to /home/user/ it shows the files and subdirectories in your home folder, etc, but if you enter a full path and hit enter - or even click on a file once it shows up below the search box - nothing happens).  My guess is that the intended behaviour is what you're used to, but it's not working right.  I'll take a look on Launchpad, and if there isn't already a bug filed on this, I'll add one.\n**Update: After doing a search on Launchpad and asking the developers on one of the bug reports, they suggested the following answer for (1): Use the Files/Folders Lens, but it's not quite there yet.\nIf you're keyboard-oriented, you can just replace Alt+F2 with Super+F.  (Simply tapping the Super key gets you a search ball also, but that will search both files and applications.)  Unfortunately, at the moment it only finds 'recent files' but they're hard at work getting full functionality in place for 11.10.\n\nA: 3) You could use the Workspace indicator, although you would need two clicks. One to open the indicator, and another to select the workspace.\n\nA: As for 2.) no you can't. The fastest way is Super+W and then click on the window. That gets even faster if you combine it with mouse gestures or magic edges.\n\nA: You could use Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Keys to switch between workspaces. Not as comfortable as a click but still fast switching. Plus you could also map custom Keyboard Shortcuts at \"Keyboard Shortcuts\"\n", "Q: How can I know if nvidia vdpau is working for mplayer/vlc/totem?

If vdpau offloading is in effect, the cpu usage should be low. On the other hand, decoding on the cpu will result in high cpu load.\n\nA: To address your question & a bit on enabling gpu decoding with mplayer or vlc.\nMplayer\nThe easiest way to see if you are getting gpu decoding thru vdpau is to do what you've done - run mplayer from a terminal. Atm what you've shown indicates you're not getting it.\nThe requisites for mplayer are:\nmplayer or mplayer 2\nnvidia-current or the nvidia drivers directly from nvidia, the nvidia-current package will do.\nlibvdpau\nMake sure you've meet the above, then run the command you did before, though make sure the video is h.264\nEx. of terminal output, removed irrelevant lines\n$ mplayer  -vo vdpau -vc ffh264vdpau /home/doug/Videos/sintel.mp4 \nMPlayer2 UNKNOWN (C) 2000-2011 MPlayer Team\nPlaying /home/doug/Videos/sintel.mp4.\nDetected file format: QuickTime/MPEG-4/Motion JPEG 2000 format (libavformat)\n[lavf] stream 0: video (h264), -vid 0\n[lavf] stream 1: audio (aac), -aid 0, -alang und\nVIDEO:  [H264]  1280x546  24bpp  24.000 fps  1597.2 kbps (195.0 kbyte/s)\n==========================================================================\nForced video codec: ffh264vdpau\nOpening video decoder: [ffmpeg] FFmpeg's libavcodec codec family\nSelected video codec: [ffh264vdpau] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg H.264 (VDPAU))\nVO: [vdpau] 1280x546 => 1280x546 H.264 VDPAU acceleration \n[vdpau] Got display refresh rate 59.991 Hz.\n\nIf you do support/get vdpau thru mplayer you can set a vc= line in ~/.mplayer/config to auto check & use the appropriate ffvdpau* decoder for supported codecs\nAnother way to check is to use vdpauinfo. The package is only available in 12.04 but can be installed in 11.10.

Additionally the performance of vaapi on nvidia is very much hardware dependent. I've enabled here but don't use, ffmpeg multi-thread is better with my hardware in vlc.\nThis is just the basics of getting vaapi & enabling in vlc.

Open The System monitor and go to the \"Processes\" tab and find VLC on the list.\nStart the trailer or movie you have and look at how high the VLC process is using CPU.\nNow stop the movie on VLC and go to Tools->Preferences->Video->Accelerated Video Output(Overlay) then \"Enable\" the Hardware acceleration and Save your settings. It may be necessary to close then restart VLC for the changes to take effect. I would restart it to be safe.\nOnce VLC is restarted with the hardware overlay enabled. Play the same movie/trailer as before and see if the CPU Resources are lower on the System Monitor panel.\nIf they are significantly lower that means it is working.\nin my case VLC went from using 60-70% CPU to only 20-30%.\nI noticed that MPlayer used even less. it went from 60-70% to under 5% with Hardware acceleration.\nYour results will vary but if Hardware acceleration is working properly you should see a pretty significant decease on CPU usage on that specific process under the System Monitor.\nFrom what I understand Video Hardware acceleration is not compatible with all video formats and it depends on your GPU as far as which formats it can decode.\n", "Q: HP probook 4520s .. drivers problem SA,\nI have HP probook 4520s Core i5 it comes with SUSE enterprise 11 and everything working but when I removed it and installed Ubuntu I got I problems with drivers nothing working\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphic is ATI Radeon HD 6370.. ubuntu hardware found driver for 6300M and I installed it but I still have problem it is wrong driver\n\n*synaptic toucpad right click isn't working also turn on/off key isn't working .

Is it possible to disable a CPU, not a core? I want to do a test to verify if the performance could make a big difference or not. \nI'm using Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: You can dynamically disable CPUs via /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online, for example to disable CPU 1, use:\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\n\nand to re-enable, use:\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\n\n\nA: Besides doing this in your BIOS grub has an option called maxcpus. \nYou can edit this option in when selecting your grub boot option by adding maxcpus=1 to the parameters. Random grub picture:\n\nChoose 'e' and you get to a command line where you can add options.\nYou can also create permanent boot option in grub by making a copy of your current boot option and add maxcpus=1 to the boot parameters. You can name this 'Ubuntu, kernel 2.5.12-9-386 (1 cpu)' and have it amongst the other boot options like the picture shows.\nYou can verify running on 1 cpu by issuing:\ncat /proc/cpuinfo   | grep processor this should show something like this:\n\nprocessor    : 0\nprocessor    : 1\n\nAnd the 2nd line should disappear after booting with 1 CPU.\n\nA: You can always unplug the CPU from its socket.  It's brute force, but you're guaranteed to get the test you want, and you don't have to worry if the kernel/BIOS/whatever switch is really doing what you hope it's doing.\nMy company has large installations of server farms in various locations around the world.  In our lab we'll sometimes remove CPUs from sockets for just such a test.  \nThere's an interesting variation on this test that you can do with multi-CPU NUMA systems. On those types of motherboards you can remove all of the memory DIMMs that are controlled by one physical CPU.  The system will still boot just fine, and you can then run tests with your application pinned to various cores which will allow you to measure the affects of \"local\" or \"remote\" memory.\n\nA: Would like to see the performance of a multithreaded application along with number of cores? If that is the case, you can use taskset utility. I guess that you have a NUMA machine. You can install numactl utility and by using it you can find which cores corresponding to which CPU. For example, your machine has two quad-core CPUS (chips). By using taskset utility you can make cores of one CPU as a set and allocate these to your application. Then your application uses only one CPU/Chip (four cores).

This uses manual instructions to edit in this text \ngksudo gedit /etc/mime.types\nand to edit it something like \ntext/extension                   extension\nThis editing of /etc/mime.types can also be accomplished with the command line stream line editor sed but I would suggest using xdg-mime.\n", "Q: Connected to WPA-secured network, but no internet My Ubuntu machine can connect to my WPA network, but there's not a trickle of internet to be found.

Check in the working computers if a proxy is set and you can add it in Ubuntu with in System -> Preferences -> \"Network Proxy\".\nTo validate if this is your problem, you should be able to ping a website in the terminal using for instance > ping www.google.com but the browser will not be able to access to the website.\nIf the ping fails, then the proxy is probably not your problem. You could then check if you have a DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf and set one if not. I usually test with OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 or 208.67.220.220) when something is not working because it is available most of the time and from anywhere. Set these two addresses in /etc/resolv.conf like this:\nnameserver 208.67.222.222\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\n\nand then try to ping a website again. If ping works but there is still no internet in the browser, then check proxy as described above and add it if necessary.\nHopefully the Internet connection will work after trying this...\n\nA: A very recent thread on Ubuntu Forums reported a suggested fix involving three changes to your Natty install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the latest madwifi drivers\n\n*Blacklisting the existing Ath5k kernel module\n\n*Using WiCD instead of Network Manager\n\n\nFollow the step-by-step guide here - post #4.\n", "Q: Boot time over 20 minutes on a virtual server I have a virtual server hosted by professionals with Ubuntu 10.04 installed.

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and I find it annoying that by default the copy/paste functionality also pastes the text format. Most of the time when I copy/paste text I only want to paste the ascii text without any formatting. Is there a way to configure that behavior?\n\nA: In fairly recent Ubuntus you can use Ctrl-Shift-v to paste plain text.\n\nA: I use parcellite . It keeps a history of the clipboard.\n\nA: I've found a way to achieve this after some searching online and experimenting with my environment.\nYou can create a custom shell script which you can then bind to a key shortcut in your desktop environment. I'm using Xfce on Linux Mint (which is based on Ubuntu). Xfce allows me to override Ctrl-C by simply defining that as the shortcut in Settings -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts, but I prefer using a different shortcut, Ctrl-Alt-C, so that I'm still able to copy with formatting in the rare cases I need to.\nHere's how I did it.\nInstall xclip:\napt-get -y install xclip\nI don't know about other desktop environments, but Xfce didn't like me using a pipe in the custom keyboard command, so I had to make a script with the xclip-line, which is then bound to my keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-C).\nMy personal habit is putting custom commands in ~/.bin and then adding that directory to the PATH variable.\nHere's how you do that, if so inclined:\nmkdir ~/.bin\necho 'export PATH=~/.bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\n(Note that you will need to re-initialize your session for that change to take effect, meaning you'll have to log out of your desktop environment and back in again. See if it worked by typing echo $PATH in a terminal after having logged in again.)\nI've then created the script ~/.bin/copy-without-formatting with the following content:\n#!/bin/bash\nxclip -o | xclip -selection clipboard\n\nRemember to make it executable with the following line:\nchmod +x ~/.bin/copy-without-formatting\nThen, since I'm using Xfce, I've gone to Settings -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts and added a shortcut with the full path to the script, without variables or a tilde. So if my username were mrgaga, the string would be /home/mrgaga/.bin/copy-without-formatting. Then I've configured the shortcut.\nXfce activates the changes immediately when I've closed the window so you should be able to check if it works right away, without logging out and in again, at least if your environment is similar enough to mine.\nI hope it helps.\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do it automatically. A workaround of course is to paste it into gedit  and copy it from there.\n\nA: In my Ubuntu 20.04 focal (x86-64) Cinnamon 4.8.6 you can use Shift-Insert to paste text without formatting.\n", "Q: Meaning of \"netinet\" in socket programming What are the meanings of \"netinet\" and \"in\" in \"#include <netinet/in.h>\" ?\n\nA: \"#include <netinet/in.h>\nThe header file in.h contains constants and structures needed for internet domain addresses.\"\nAs quoted at http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm\n\nA: It means \"Internet\"... obvious really.\n", "Q: System monitor (panel) shows the wrong amount of used ram My system monitor in the upper panel show the wrong amount of ram. as shown in my screenshot.\nis this a bug or can I fix this in any way? my laptop freezes once a day, it's starting to be a real problem. \nThe red rectangle in my right upper panel is full when it should be half full. \n\n\nA: The memory usage in Linux is often very high because unused memory is used as a cache (I'm not too sure a cache for what, probably for disk access). So make sure that the red bar in the upper panel is not related to cache memory. You can configure the upper bar monitor by right clicking on it and selecting Preferences. There you can select the colors for the different types of memory, set a different color for cache and User.\nIn the graphical memory usage the cache memory is considered as free memory (And it is technically the case as cache can be used at any moment for new programs) so this is why you see different values.\n", "Q: Compiz config won't start a month ago I asked a question regarding the CCSM and workspaces settings.\nHow do I set the number of workspaces?\nA few days ago I realized that CCSM wasn't even on when I'm logging into Ubuntu, and now, each time I log out and back in, I have to use  compiz --replace &  just to run it manually, which is quite a pain to do each time.\nSince I upgraded to Natty Narwhal I got this problem.\nI was wondering what do I need to do in order to fix that problem (needless to say that reinstalling CCSM doesn't really work).\nThnx\nRoyi\n\nA: I had the same problem, with Compiz not starting on Ubuntu 11.04 Classic.

In the dialog that just should have appeared, click the add button. In the command field, paste the compiz --replace & command, type something like Compiz in the name field, this is just to identify it for yourself. Click the Add (or OK) button, and close the dialog.\n\nA: The proper way to do this is to tell Gnome to use compiz as your default window manager and not use metacity at all. Simply put this in your ~/.gnomerc \n(create that file if it does not exist yet):\nexport WINDOW_MANAGER=/usr/bin/compiz \nSpread the word!\nas for the fusion icon , its only purpose is to switch windows managers and if you're committed to compiz and have added this file, then the icon is pretty much renundent unless you really need to game that bad (or your system es...)\n", "Q: Firefox 4.0.1 crash intermittently and log out Intermittently Firefox 4.0.1 is crashing on Ubuntu 11.04 and logging out.

I think this is a standard principle of mouse movement in human-computer interaction.\nBelow is a screenshot of what I see, when my mouse goes slightly too far up and activates the launcher and hides the back and close buttons, which I was intending to press:\n\nQuestion\nThus, is there a way of making the Unity Launcher only show in response to a button click?\nUpdate:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is some other recognition of this issue here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1767743\n\n*I note that when I start \"Launcher and Menus\" there are only two choices. \"pushes the left edge of the screen and touches the top left corner of the screen\".

I've used Gpick and was recently introduced to this website but I'm really after a desktop application (for when I'm not connected to the Internet) that can generate color schemes.\nAre there any applications that can do that?\n\nA: Compiz has a colour filter plugin. It allows you to transform any colour into another and it sounds like it might be perfect for highlighting colour blindness. What is instantly better than a browser plugin is that you can apply this to any window or even the entire screen.\nYou'll want to install compizconfig-settings-manager before you do anything else. And one note before you enable it, you'll probably need to change the keys because they'll conflict with other plugins. The combination in the screenshot below worked for me.\n\nIf you can't find it, make sure compiz-plugins-main is installed.\nIt seems like deuteranopia and protanopia are the filters you want.

Of course, even if you have the newest equipment out, you could still use Xubuntu.\nIf your system has less than 192MB of system memory, use the Alternate Installation CD.\nNote: If you have a low-specification computer, certain features may be automatically turned off to conserve system resources. For example, if you have a graphics card with only a small amount of video memory (VRAM), the boot-up screen may not be shown.\nFollow this link for detailed instructions: Installation/LowMemorySystems.\nMinimum system requirements for Xubuntu would fall roughly between Ubuntu Server and Desktop:\n256MB of system memory (RAM)\n2GB of disk space\nGraphics card and monitor capable of 800x600 resolution \n\nRegarding processors, a recent thread on the Ubuntu Forums describes a 500 MHz Xubuntu machine as being \"too slow\" and discusses alternatives: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1267443\nAlternatives but not getting closer to your pre-requisites so it would require manual labour from your part: \n\n\n*\n\n*server install. 1 Gb required but no GUI and no GUI browser.\n\n*minimal CD install: 20 Mb required.\n\n\nYou can download the i386 here: Ubuntu 11.04 \"Natty Narwhal\" Minimal CD (others you can find at the minimal CD install link above. \nTo install, boot your computer from the the Minimal CD and type \"cli\" (command line\ninstall) at the prompt.

Its memory is usually shared with the main RAM of the system and it is dynamic, which means it increases and decreases on demand. In my system, I later discovered that it can grow up to 1.7 GB, and this value seems to be standard if you have a system with 4.0 GB of RAM (my case).\nIf you use a graphics card like this, the above output won't be of much help.\n\nA: nvidia-settings does this for cards using the proprietary nvidia driver. It may be inaccurate but it is correct for my particular card. I don't know of any other userspace tool that specifically queries the video driver.\nYou can also try sudo lshw -class display but I can't guarantee that it will be any more accurate than lspci. Also it reports memory ranges, not amounts, so you'd have to do some math.\nI find that grep -i memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log correctly reports the VRAM on my system's card. It does not work for my laptop using driver radeon with integrated Radeon Mobility device.\n\nA: There is a program called hardinfo, available in the Software Center, which will list out each video card (under the Devices drop-down, in the PCI Devices category) and the specs for each card, including the memory and vendor/model.\n", "Q: Help me install guest additions on Ubuntu 11.04 I'm having problems installing guest additions on a Ubuntu 11.04 guest os.

I just checked with uname -a to get the correct version, then check using aptitude and noticed that the correct version is already installed.\nI am using VirtualBox 4.0.8.\n\nA: You will need to install the kernel modules (headers) package that match the kernel version you are running the Ubuntu virtual machine with.\nType the following command in the terminal:\nuname -a\n\nThis will give you line like this:\nLinux dirk-Studio-1558 2.6.38-9-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 28 15:23:06 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nThe first word is the type of system, the second is the name of your machine and the third one is the one you are looking for.

HI Guys!\nI am working on Ubuntu 10.04 version.\nI accidentally deleted my code from find -delete command.\nIs there any way to recover the data?\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nA: Restore from backup.  If you don't make regular backups, then sooner or later something like this will happen and you will lose data.\n\nA: If you do a google for undelete linux, you will find a method of finding deleted file entries, however, while the system runs, there is every chance the space is overwritten.  Having done something similar, in the end, I ended up using strings, and grep to extract the source from the disk, and then replacing a lot of the brackets and punctuation.\nUndelete usually occurs on systems where they dont delete the file, they move it and hide it aka windows, unix was not designed to be that kind of system. \nThis works on ext2 (and is the method I mentioned to start with http://e2undel.sourceforge.net/recovery-howto.html) however, do be aware, it may not work.\nBest way to get deleted files back on unix is to restore from a backup.\n\nA: While it is possible (at least some parts) as already @BugFinder told. But for the future:\nThe first thing what you should do - remember it:\nImmediately turn off your computer.\nIf you don't run mission critical database, the best is turning off from a power and not  by regular shutdown or soo, because your shutdown maybe will write some data into (already freed blocks from the deleted files). And here is a chance, than your file-delete is not synced from the memory buffers into the hdd.\nOfc, you will get corrupted filesystem, but usually can repair it without problems (fsck) and you will do some voo-doo filesystem hacking with fsdb anyway... ;)\nBackup frequently is a good idea, or use more intelligent OS/Filesystem combination. For example FreeBSD/ZFS. (I don't want start any flamewar, so please don't comment my last line). :)\n", "Q: Can I limit the size of ~/.xsession-errors? Is there some way to limit size of .xsession-errors.?  \nI'm getting huge numbers of one particular debug information messages and it has blown the file size up to 2.8 GB (over many months). The message accounts for 95% of all the lines in .xsession-errors.  \nI think I know which app it is, and I'll have to look into that separately, but for now I'd like to know if there is a setting to prevent open-ended growth of the log..  \nThe log is currently split over 2 files.. (0.8 GB and 2.0 GB)  \nUPDATE:\nAfter applying RobinJ's suggestion of logrotate (which does keep the file size down), I noticed that after I manually deleted the 2.0 GB file .xsession-errors.old, it has re-appeared (size = 0) ...   \nThis means that something other than logrotate is managing this log file, in which case it seems that this other app may be able to manage the log's size limit, etc. and would be more appropriate..   \nWhat is this program? \n===========\nPost answer edit: My update actually changed the tone of the original question and Mark Russell has answered this second point very well....  RobinJ has answered my original question as per the title.. thanks to both..\n\nA: logrotate should be able to do that.\n\nA: fred.  .xsession-errors is cleared on every restart of your X session.  Actually, it's renamed to .xsession-errors.old and a new .xsession-errors is created upon X login.  So if you have a massive .xsession-errors log, two logout/logins would clear it out.  So will manually deleting it, my point is that given the regularity of kernel security updates, it's not expected that sessions will last for months.\nYour description (the file growing so large over the course of months) suggests that you haven't rebooted during this period. If this is not the case, i.e., you have restarted the system and yet the file was never rotated, please post more information, starting with: what release of Ubuntu are you using?  Are you running GNOME or KDE or another desktop environment?\nAs for the file re-appearing automatically, there is no separate application managing the log file.  The reason the file is recreated is because of how redirection works.  E.g. the command echo stuff >> /var/log/stuff.log will work whether or not /var/log/stuff.log exists.\n\nA: I found the command that shows you wich program is accesing wich file.\nIt's lsof.\nTo find out wich program is using .xsession-errors, you can use lsof | grep .xsession-errors.\nAdditionaly, there's also fuser. It's a bit easier to use in my opinion.You can just use fuser .xsession-errors. It will give you the file and the PID of the process wich is using the file. Adding -v makes it also show you the name of the program itself. Adding -k will just kill the processes wich are using the file.\n\nA: My fix is the following:\ndaily cron job: tail ~/.xsession-errors > ~/.xsession-errors\nI'm not really in the mood to figure out which Ubuntu package is broken. This doesn't happen on my non Ubuntu systems.\nPlease note that this will effectively be the same as just >~/.xsession-errors, i.e. truncating the file. \nThere's also a way to permanently redirect .xsession-errors to /dev/null, see here.\n", "Q: Converting DJVU to PDF I want to convert a DJVU document into a PDF document, separating and preserving the text layer and the images while also keeping the structure from the DJVU. How can I do this in Ubuntu?\n(I will then be using Calibre to convert to ePub/Mobi, so if there were a Calibre plug-in for this entire process that would be perfect for me!)\nNote1: Printing from Evince, exporting from DJview, or anything using the package ddjvu, are not adequate solutions as they discard the text layer, saving only images.\nNote2: Using DJVULibre seems to only extract the text layer and pictures are not extracted. Similarly, copying the text \"manually\" loses the both document structure and the pictures.\n\nA: There is djvu2pdf but it relies on ghostscript so it might be another printing option. I still suggest you give it a look, just in case it's more clever than I'm giving it credit.\nIt's not in the repos but you can download a deb from the makers' site: http://0x2a.at/s/projects/djvu2pdf\n** Insert mandatory notice about downloading/installing things from outside the repos here **\n\nA: Method 1\nSimply use DJView and export as PDF\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*Install DJview4  \n\n*Run DJview (Applications - Graphics - DJView4)  \n\n*Open your .djvu document  \n\n*: Menu - Export As: PDF    \n\n\nMethod 2\nOpen the djvu file in evince\nSelect print ----> print to file\nchange .ps to .pdf and click print\nMethod 3\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*Install \ndjvulibre-bin libdjvulibre21 okular-extra-backends evince libevdocument3 libevview3\n\n*Goto terminal and write\n sudo apt-get install libtiff-tools\n\n\n*Goto the directory where the djvu file is present.

If DjVu document has color images, then they'll be usually placed on background layer; in this case user can take advantage of tools like ddjvu (extract only background layer) and imagemagick (auto-crop) to output just images instead whole canvas, but it can't be automated for creating PDF output  \nAnother saner, but slower approach is use of regular OCR GUI tools. gscan2pdf (> 1.0) is suggested as possible candidate for Linux PC\n\nA: I made a script of @zetah's answer.\nIt is available here: https://gist.github.com/matthieuheitz/7287e214b1aeda7948f6c27fbfb5288b\n\nA: http://www.djvu-pdf.com/ - Using this website you can convert djvu to pdf.\n\nA: The easiest way: use gscan2pdf to import the djvu, then OCR it with tesseract, and finally save it as a pdf. The OCR'd text in the pdf might be slightly different from the original djvu, and the conversion may take a while, but this method is a no-brainer and it works.\n", "Q: Unable to resume if suspended for more than 20 minutes on a Dell Inspiron N5010 I am using 11.04 64bit on Dell Inspiron N5010.

I've been casually working on this for a few months but I'm finally getting frustrated enough to post about it.\nI was wondering if it was possible to share the tethered internet connection that comes stock on Android phones with 2.2 with an additional laptop? To be clear, I want to have a laptop receiving a tethered internet connection from a 2.2 Android phone and I want to share that with another laptop connected through Ethernet. Specifically, I'm trying to do this on Ubuntu Linux 10.10.\nI have gotten this to work on Windows 7 using EasyTether and the Windows ICS but unfortunately I need this to work on Ubuntu Linux. Note, this really doesn't help me because  I would really like this to work as a legitimate network, when I use EasyTether to share the connection, I cannot ping the other laptop, which makes me think they are connected in a different manner besides routes. Also note, The EasyTether and Ubuntu's ICS through Network Manager does not work. \nThe latest thing I have tried is to set up a bridge between the phone's network interface and the 2nd laptop's interface. This allows me to ping to the phone from the second laptop. However, this disables the internet the laptop the phone is connected to and I certainly can't get on the internet on the second laptop.\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is: is this sort of thing even possible? If anyone has any suggestions, advice, or links, I would be glad to listen.\n\nA: This sort of thing should definitely be possible, android will not be your limiting factor.\nAs for your computer, you may want to look into configuring iptables and/or setting up the machine receiving the tether as a gateway. The specifics of those topics are probably best discussed on https://askubuntu.com/\n", "Q: Generate IP address to bypass shared IP My ISP forces a shared IP on their users, is there a way to generate an IP address to bypass it?\nEven if bypassing shared IP is not possible, what are the methods to set/change a unique IP address?\n\nA: You might look into setting up an IPv6 tunnel, particularly if you need addresses strictly for private use (or for the use of people outside the US.)\nYou can tunnel an HTTP server with PageKite.\nChunkHost is currently running a free beta, if you need a VPS temporarily or will be willing to pay for it in the future.\nUnfortunately, unless you are in charge of the network you don't get to control allocation of IP addresses.\nWhen / if network providers finally switch over to IPv6 there will be plenty of addresses for everyone; hopefully we all will be able to get static IPs then. \nBecause NAT is bad.\n\nA: By saying 'shared IP address', do you really mean a 'dynamic' IP address that is one out of a pool of IP addresses that your ISP uses so it does not necessarily stay the same.  If this is what you have, then you need to set up a dynamic address with an organisation like DynDNS.  They will give you a domain name that will always point back to you because they track any changes your ISP makes to the IP address assigned to you.\n\nA: No I don't think generating an IP address to bypass it is possible at least to my knowledge. You might wanna try to use a VPN if any is available to you...\nBut anyways, why do you want to change the IP anyhow? If you wanna set up a server, you should tell the ISP to give you unique IP address, or look for somewhere else to host your server.........\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The method to get a unique static ip address is to rent one from your isp. Most isp's doesn't force you to use a dynamic ip from their pool, they sell static ip's as an additional service.

(Mine require 10 norwegian kroner, about 2$ a month for a static ip).\n", "Q: Syncing a C++ app with Ubuntu One I'm currently developing an app, in C++, that will sync it's data with Ubuntu One, but I can't find any documentation online that explains how to do this. I found Ryan Paul's Ars Technica article that provides an excellent introduction to doing this in Python while mentioning that there exists a library that will facilitate this in C, but it doesn't provide an hint as to where this C-based solution can be found. I've Googled around for a bit, but no-one seems to be talking about developing apps that take advantage of Ubuntu One sync.\nDoes anyone know where I can information on this C-based interface? \n\nA: Ubuntu One provides data synchronisation through desktopcouch, which is a local version of CouchDB which is automatically synced with Ubuntu One and all your machines. Some documentation for the cloud and Python APIs is available at Ubuntu One here, which may be useful if you want to build web apps or mobile apps which work with the same data as your Ubuntu C++ app. \nThe C/C++ API isn't yet on the developer site (it will be soon!), so here's a summary which should be enough to get started.\nFor C/C++, you have couchdb-glib and desktopcouch-glib. couchdb-glib provides the generic CouchDB API, and desktopcouch-glib just provides one object, which creates a Session object with all that is needed for connecting to Ubuntu One's desktopcouch.\nSo:\nDesktopcouchSession *dc = desktopcouch_session_new ();\n\nDesktopcouchSession is a subclass of CouchdbSession, so once you get one instance of it, you can use the methods in CouchdbSession to access the underlying CouchDB instance:\nGSList              *couchdb_session_list_databases (CouchdbSession *session, \n                                                     GError **error);\nCouchdbDatabase     *couchdb_session_get_database (CouchdbSession *session, \n                                                   const char *dbname, \n                                                   GError **error);\ngboolean             couchdb_session_create_database (CouchdbSession *session, \n                                                      const char *dbname, \n                                                      GError **error);\ngboolean             couchdb_session_delete_database (CouchdbSession *session, \n                                                      const char *dbname, \n                                                      GError **error);\n\nWith those methods you manage databases, and with get_database and create_database you get an instance of a CouchdbDatabase object, which allows you to manage the documents in the databases:\nGSList       *couchdb_database_get_all_documents (CouchdbDatabase *database, \n                                                  GError **error);\ngboolean      couchdb_database_put_document (CouchdbDatabase *database,\n                                             CouchdbDocument *document,\n                                             GError **error);\ngboolean      couchdb_database_delete_document (CouchdbDatabase *database, \n                                                CouchdbDocument *document, \n                                                GError **error);\n\nAs you can see, for managing the documents themselves, there's another object, CouchdbDocument. Also, there are subclasses of this one for managing specific types of documents, like CouchdbDocumentContact (for contacts).\nYou can get the complete API reference by installing the #libcouchdb-glib-doc  package. Installing #libdesktopcouch-glib-dev  should pull in all the libraries you need.\nThe API gives you access to CouchDB, so of course you'll need to know how CouchDB itself works, and how you store data in it. The short answer is: data is stored in JSON documents, and extracted by document ID or with pre-computed views. http://guide.couchdb.org/ is the CouchDB book which explains Couch's method of data storage in more detail.\nIf you have questions, do please ping me (aquarius) or rodrigo on #ubuntuone on freenode. I'd be more than happy to talk with you about what you're planning to do and good ways to model that data in the Ubuntu One data storage system.\n", "Q: Why does my computer say that there is an 11.10 upgrade?

It should contain text similar to the following:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom glob import glob\n\nsetup(name = \"WebPad\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    author=\"znetor\",\n    packages=[\"jspad\"],\n    data_files=[('share/webpad/pixmaps', glob(\"pixmaps/*\"), ('share/webpad/templates', ['templates/webpad.tpl'])],\n    scripts=['run.py'])\n\nAnd you should also create a MANIFEST.in file:\nrecursive-include pixmaps *\nrecursive-include templates *\n\nOne you've done that, you can run various commands on the terminal to distribute your project:\nchmod +x setup.py\nsudo ./setup.py install # installs your project to /usr/local\n./setup.py sdist # creates a source distribution in dist/\n\nThe last command is the one we're interested in. Once you've got a source distribution with a distutils setup.py script, you can then follow the Python packaging guide for Ubuntu. Basically, it involves creating a debian/ directory in the root of your project with various bits of information and running debuild.\nI wrote a tutorial on how to do this a while ago, some of it is not best practise, but it will help you understand a few concepts.\n\nA: I always liked \"learn by example\" methods, so here it goes:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/all/software-center/download\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the package from one of the\nmirrors.\n\n*Open it with the archive manager.\n\n*You will see some directories. They are structured like you are in the absolute root of the file system.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe runner will have to go in the /usr/bin/ directory. Rename it into \"web-pad\" or \"webpad\" and  make sure it starts with \"#!/usr/bin/python\". That way you can easily launch it from command line, without having to write \"python web-pad\". Instead, \"web-pad\" will be enough.\nThe other files will have to go into /usr/share/web-pad/ or /usr/share/webpad/\nFor the launcher to work, you will need to make a /usr/share/pyshared-data/web-pad or /usr/share/pyshared-data/webpad file. I think it adds your source files to the include path, so the launcher can launch them. Again, as an example of one, use the /usr/share/pyshared-data/software-center file inside the package.\nYou should also have a look at other files in the software center package. They can provide some very useful information.\nAnd yeah, look at the files in the DEBIAN directory. Especially the control file, as it is where you set the dependencies, description, version, conflicts, etc...\nThe triggers file allows you to set triggers to your application.

Any ideas?\n\nA: A couple of things may be wrong here:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to make absolutely sure you've selected the 3G provider (and plan if applicable) for what you're using for your mobile broadband.\n\n*You need to make sure that the device (your 3G-dongle (or 4G if that's what you're using)) is mounted and receiving signal. On the common Huawei 3G modems, this is indicated by the green light on the top of the modem switching to a blinking blue when receiving signal and a solid blue when connected.\n\n*On some Huawei modems (there may be other brands I don't know of that have this problem as well) the hardware is not natively supported, and since its driver relies on authentication through a windows only program, the way I have solved this is by connecting my modem to a windows machine for the first run, from which I disabled PIN-authentication on the modem. That solved my issues with connecting via Network Manager.\nIf none of the above seems to be the issue, another explanation could be that your modem has not been properly removed and that something is corrupted.\n\nA: I have a mobile broadband connection with USB modem. When I set it up, it worked right away, but when I loose connection, in order to reconnect I must put USB modem out and plug it in again, then unmount it, and reconnect.\nI know this is not an answer, but that's all I can say about my expirience with mobile broadband connection.\n", "Q: How to avoid using sudo when working in /var/www? I want to stop having to use sudo everytime I work in /var/www. How can I do that? I simply want to put all of my sites into this directory and work with them without too much pain.\n\nA: It's this simple. You neither need to enable apache 'UserDir' (not recommended) nor messing up with 'www-data' groups (apache group in case on Fedora)\nJust create your project directory inside /var/www/html\ncd /var/www/html\nsudo mkdir my_project\n\nThen just chown the project directory to your user.\nsudo chown your_username my_project\n\nNow you can start working on your project folder as a regular user with any editor, IDE of your choice. No more sudos : )\n\nA: Don'ts\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't set file permissions to 777 (world-writable)\nThis is a significant security flaw, especially if you enable server-side scripting such as PHP.  Unprivileged processes should not be able to write to files that would affect the website or, in the case of server-side scripting being used, execute arbitrary code.\n\n*Don't add yourself as a member of the www-data group and give it write permissions\nThe purpose of that group is that it is an unprivileged group that the server processes run as.  They should only have read access to the website files where possible, for the same reasons as above.\n\n*Don't change the permissions of the Apache processes\nThe Apache child processes run as the www-data user and group by default, and this should not be altered.  This is just a way of giving them no write permission to the filesystem.\nIn certain circumstances you want your server-side scripts to be able to write to files, in which case only those files should be made writable by www-data and care needs to be taken to ensure security.\nDos\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the files to be owned by yourself\nIf you are the only one, or the usual one, to modify certain files on the website, then it makes total sense just to take ownership of those files.  Set their owner to <your username>.\nYou don't have to modify the server permissions for this, as the server will continue to get read-only access even when the files are owned by you.\n\n*Choose a sensible place to house the files (using DocumentRoot)\nIf /var/www doesn't make sense, you are welcome to place them elsewhere.  If they are specific to your own development or testing, you could place them in your home directory.  Or you can set up some directories in /srv.\n\n*If you want to give group write access, create a new group for the purpose\nDon't re-use a system group, because these are typically designed to have the access they currently have, and no more, for security reasons.\n\nA: If you make /var/www writeable by its group and add yourself to the group, you will not have to use sudo while still being fairly secure. Try this:\nsudo adduser <username> www-data\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www\nsudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www\n\nYou should then be able to edit /var/www/ files without hassle.\nThe first line adds you to the www-data group, the second line clears up any files with messed up ownership, and the third makes it so that all users who are members of the www-data group can read and write all files in /var/www.\n\nA: Most answers here are not written with security in mind. It's good to get a feeling that running sudo each time is not very wise. If you make a typo (for example a single space in a wrong place, such as recursively deleting / var/www/dir, which means / and var/www/dir, instead of /var/www/dir—please do not attempt), you might trash your system.\nNote: Starting with Apache 2.4.7 / Ubuntu 14.04, /var/www has been moved to /var/www/html Adjust the commands in this answer accordingly.\nSee:\n\n*\n\n*Where to place my local website starting with the 2.4.7 version of apache2?\n\n\n*Why has the apache2 www dir been moved to /var/www/html?\n\n\n*Changing the default document root for HTTP server\nBad ideas:\n\n*\n\n*chmod 777 (sagarchalise) - this allows anyone with access to your system write into the directories and files and thereby allowing the intruder to execute any code under the www-data user\n\n*chgrp -R www-data $HOME (cob) - this allows www-data to read or write any files in the home directory. This is not keeping the Least Privilege rule in mind\n\n*chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www (kv1dr) - unless the world has read permissions on /var/www, the webserver running under www-data will not be able to read (serve) the files. If the file is a public-accessible plain HTML document, it might not be an issue if the world can read the file. But if the file is a PHP file containing passwords, it is.\n\nNOTE: in the below solutions, I've granted www-data write privileges. However, /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/users-and-groups.txt.gz states:\n\nwww-data\nSome web servers run as www-data. Web content should not be owned by this\nuser, or a compromised web server would be able to rewrite a web site. Data\nwritten out by web servers will be owned by www-data.\n\nWhere possible, do not grant write permissions to the www-data group. www-data only needs to be able to read the files so the webserver can serve it. The only case where www-data needs write permissions is for directories storing uploads and other locations which needs to be written.\nSolution 1\nAdd yourself to the www-data group and set the setgid bit on the /var/www directory such that all newly created files inherit this group as well.\nsudo gpasswd -a \"$USER\" www-data\n\nCorrect previously created files (assuming you to be the only user of /var/www):\nsudo chown -R \"$USER\":www-data /var/www\nfind /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0660 {} \\;\nsudo find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2770 {} \\;\n\n(even safer: use 640 or 2750 and manually chmod g+w file-or-dir that needs to be writable by the webserver)\nSolution 2\nCreate a symlink for each project to your home directory. Say your project is located at ~/projects/foo and you want to have it located at /var/www/foo, run:\nsudo ln -sT ~/projects/foo /var/www/foo\n\nIf your home directory has no execute bit (descend) set for other (for security reasons), change the group of it to www-data, but set the execute bit only (no read/write). Do the same for the ~/projects folder as it may contain other projects than www. (You don't need sudo if you have previously added your user to the www-data group.)\nsudo chgrp www-data ~ ~/projects\nchmod 710 ~ ~/projects\n\nSet the group to www-data on ~/projects/foo and allow the webserver to read and write to files and files+directories and descend into directories:\nsudo chgrp www-data ~/projects/foo\nfind ~/projects/foo -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \\;\nfind ~/projects/foo -type d -exec chmod 2770 {} \\;\n\nEven safer: use 640 and 2750 by default and manually chmod files and directories that need to be writable by the webserver user. The setgid bit should be added only if you want every newly created file in ~/projects/foo to be accessible by the group.\nFrom now on, you can access your site at http://localhost/foo and edit your project files in ~/projects/foo.\nSee also\n\n*\n\n*Permissions issue: how can Apache access files in my Home directory?\n\n*Reasons why /var/www should not have chmod 777\n\nA: chmod in /var on www to allow the owner access, and chown to make sure you own it. Probably a stupid idea, but it would definitely work.\n\nA: Rather than storing my web sites in /var/www I place links there to the sites which are located in my home folder. I can freely edit, or add pages to my sites. When I happy with changes I then FTP to a hosting company where my domain name links.\n\nA: You could start a www-session in a terminal by\nsudo su www-data\n\nCombined with a differently colored prompt*, to make it more obvious that it is the shell of a different user, and a policy always to put the corresponding xterm (and editor and such) on - for example - the virtual desktop 4, so that you get used to it, to avoid confusion.\n*) For a differently colored prompt with a differnt character, create a file /etc/prompt like this:\n# PROMPTING\n#       When  executing  interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command, and the sec-\n#       ondary prompt PS2 when it needs more input to complete a command.

I have a computer running Mythbuntu 11.04, and it has Banshee 2.0 installed on it. I also have an Android phone that I use as a music player.\nI want to get Banshee and Android talking to each other so that I can synchronize my playlists and all that good stuff.\nHere's the thing... my Mythbuntu machine is hidden away under a desk, where it acts as a sort of file and media server. It has a screen and remote control attached for watching videos, but no keyboard or mouse.\nWhen I want to use Banshee, I access it from one of my other two machines via this SSH command:\nssh -X mythbuntu@192.168.0.64 banshee\nSo far, so good.\nNow, I plug in my Android device to a USB port on the Mythbuntu machine, then open up Banshee via SSH on one of my other computers. The Android device does not appear in the Banshee interface.\nFor a long time I thought I was missing some driver or something, but after some experimentation, I discovered that if I open up Banshee on the computer itself (in other words, I plug in a keyboard and mouse and test out accessing it directly), then the Android device is automagically detected and everything works as expected.\nSo... the problem seems to be that for some reason, when I am running Banshee from an SSH connection, it can not see the Android device.\nBut that confuses me... why should the SSH connection matter? Is it that the SSH user is a different user from the one when I log into the machine directly (I use the same user name and password)?\nMore importantly, is there a way I can convince Banshee that when I open it via SSH and plug in the Android device that it should talk to the Android the same way it talks to Android when I am sitting at the computer itself?\nI hope I've explained the situation clearly.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Why you don't see it\nMounting file systems is a privileged operation on Unix systems.  The udisks daemon is used to provide a way for non-privileged users to mount volumes (such as the USB Mass Storage service offered by your phone), but will only allow active sessions to perform the operation.\nWhen you are logged on at the console and haven't locked the screen, you are considered to have an active session.  When you ssh into the system, this is not the case.  The idea is to only let someone with physical access to the system mount removable devices.\nIf you mount the phone manually, your music player should be able to access the files on it.\nHow to find it\n\n\n*\n\n*Run dmesg and look for your device. It should show up as something like /dev/sdb2. \"sd\" for scsi disk (scsi instructions are standard for disks now), a letter for the disk (a, b, c, etc), and a number for the partition.\n\n*Or run sudo fdisk -l to get a list of your disks and partitions. You'll see it here somewhere.\nMount it manually\nOnce you find the device path (eg, /dev/sdb2), mount it with this command:\nmount /dev/sdb2 /mnt\n\nIf you want, make a folder and mount it there instead:\nmkdir ~/android\nmount /dev/sdb2 ~/android\n\n", "Q: How could I tune the linux kernel parameters so that socket could be recycled frequently?

I try Install Ubuntu 10.10 and it's worked. But when I Install Ubuntu 10.10 netbook edition, I can't load my ubuntu (after choose a ubuntu from GRUB loader). Maybe the problem is unity system or something like that.\n\nA: Update: I've posted a short solution as a separate answer. Following in this answer is what I suggested before I came to it.\nThe problem is with Wi-Fi definitely!\nAfter a day of testing every possible way (64 and 32 bit, standard and alternative versions of 10.04, 10.10, 11.04) to install Ubuntu on my Aspire One 522 (same chipset and same C-50 Fusion processor) I finally found a solution on how to install and run it, thanks to your assumptions on the wi-fi adapter.\nThe problems I had with all versions of Ubuntu were that they all hung in some starting phase of installation when the wi-fi led began to blink. So assuming that was the problem I started looking for a way to turn this damn thing off, but there was no physical switch for that on this model and the Fn+F3 seemed to work only when the driver was up and running on Windows. The solution I found was to simply plug the laptop to LAN with a cable. Thus I successfully installed 11.04 32 bit and was able to boot into 11.04 64 bit setup but just didn't have time to install it.\nSo now I'm able to run Ubuntu okay but only with the LAN cable plugged in - as soon as I detach it after a couple of seconds when Ubuntu starts to scan wi-fi networks it hangs. So now I'm looking for a solution on the Wi-Fi driver.\nP.S. Also I'd like to inform you guys that I was able to install Fedora 15 32-bit edition with absolutely no problems: both bluetooth and wi-fi worked with no problems. The 64-bit Fedora I could not, though I didn't try as hard as with Ubuntu ). So if nothing works out we can always swithc to Fedora. Guess we can also find out which driver Fedora uses for this piece of ...wi-fi.\nUpdate. Now that I've tried reinstalling the 32 bit Fedora, which previously worked just fine, the same thing happened in it. I've also been able to install Fedora 64bit and Ubuntu 64 bit with a described method. I tried upgrading to latest 3.0 kernel, but every single distribution I've installed suffers from exactly the same problem with the wireless module. Btw, in my case it wasn't a Broadcom, but Atheros AR9285. If you have the same one this could probably be a solution for you: System freeze caused by ath9k driver \nAs for me I say fork this sheet I go back to Window monster! At least I can watch videos there. Btw wtf is wrong with AMD and their ATI drivers support?! Are they lazy or just stupid? Man, I'm really disappointed with all this story.\n\nA: I read this somewhere else that I can't remember so I can't take credit for it.

(That port has a strange symbol indicating that it is no ordinary USB port, but I'm not sure what it means)\n\nA: I am having the same problem : my Vostro 3550 will not boot Ubuntu 11.04 neither in amd64 nor in ia32 versions, and not install Ubuntu 11.04 (I tried both architectures) from my EMTEC 4GB - which works perfectly everywhere else.\nThe reason why the CD/DVD does not boot might be by design, for security reasons (you cannot boot ophcrack from it, for instance). However this seems contradictory with both the BIOS and the F12 key choice allowing you to select your boot device. And anyway the administrator should have the last word about whether (s)he wants to allow it or not.\nAny feedback, somebody ?

I have the domain thanks to dyndns.com which points to the computer and the router is port-forwarded to the server computer. But am I supposed to forward to the server or the virtual machine's IP? Now when I try to connect I get an error: failed to connect.\nAnd how does these authentication methods work: null, external, guest?\n\nA: To connect to the services, you'll have to have a address on the local area network and not on a private \"bridged\" interface for the virtual machine. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Virtual Box\n\n*shutdown the Windows virtual machine if it's running\n\n*right-click on the virtual machine and select settings\n\n*Select Network and for Attached to: select Bridged Adaptor\n\n\nYour virtual host should now have an address from the main network. Forward the ports to this address. And probably configure an appropriate static address in Windows.\n\nA: If the virtual machine has an IP from the local network, you can connect via Samba, WWW, or rdesktop\nIf the virtual machine has an IP of the host's internal \"Default\" network, e.g., 192.168.122.x, you'll only be able to connect via VNC.  \nTo connect via VNC, add new graphics hardware to the VM in Virtual Machine Manager, telling it to listen on all public interfaces.  You can then forward a port from your router to the host's IP address, with the port listed in virt-manager, usually something like 5901.\n-Eric\n\nA: It is not clear what connect means here. But if you are trying to connect to your VM using Remote Desktop then you have to forward the 3389 port on you router to the host ip (where host is the computer running the virtual machine, not the one running on the VM).\nYou will also need to have installed the Oracle Extension Pack and have enabled RDP in the Virtual Machine settings.\n\nSorry for the spanish screenshot, I hope that you find the place in your own language.\nAbout the authentication: \n\n\n*\n\n*None means that there is no authentication, the system will let you connect the same way that a local screen, i.e. it will only ask for a password if you are not logged or you had blocked the screen.\n\n*Extrenal uses some external method to authenticate. In a linux host that means that you will need to use a PAM server. Not really useful for personal use. One note: you can use this to hook into your own authentication lib, which is really geeky.\n\n*Guest uses your guest authentication system. If you are running a windows guest, that means that it will always ask you for your windows user and password to let you log in. This is the easiest way, but you will need to have the Guest Additions running on your guest to be able to use it.\nYou can find much more info in the user manual.\n\nA: Right click on your virtual machine and click settings then go to networks tab and then change the Attached to: setting to Bridged Adapter default is NAT.\nThen start your virtual machine and you have an ip reference to the virtual machine from your network so just install vnc server on the vm like ultravnc and you're good. \n", "Q: plus or dash at perm bits? When I need to find all files with SUID recursively starting from root directory I can do it in two not so different ways:\n\nfind / -perm -4000 \n\nand the second one:\n\nfind / -perm +4000 \n\nWhich variant is preferable and why?\n\nA: Those are 2 different ways of searching. perm allows for 3 methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*-perm mode: permission bits set for the file are exactly that to match the search\n\n*-perm -mode: all of the permission bits are set for the file to match the search\n\n*-perm +mode: any of the permission bits are set for the file to match the search\nSo using - or + depends on what you want to find.\nExamples:\nfind / -type f -perm 0777 will find all files set as rwxrwxrwx (owner, group AND other)\nfind / -type f +perm 0777 will find all files set as rwx for owner rwx for group OR rwx for other\nBtw... it looks like the + is a the same as a '/`.\n", "Q: How do I use GPL and MIT licenses correctly? Since our own Alaukik asked me to put a few scripts under GPL-License I wondered if I am doing it correctly. The points that concern me are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to include the whole license with my project or is a comment like # Copyright by John Doe, 2011 Licensed under the MIT license: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php legally sufficient?\n\n*Do I have to include my real name or is an e-Mail or other alias legally waterproof?\n\n*Is the year important? I would guess 'yes' as copyrights expire in most countries after a certain period. What happens if I don't?\n\n*Should I use GPL over MIT? I tend towards MIT as it is more permissive and I don't care whether my scripts are used in closed source software.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\nThere is a very good page on 'How to use GNU licenses for your own software'. The gnu website also makes suggestons on how to aply the licenses to your project (™Flimm). That covers a lot for the GPL. \nBottom line - license choice: If you want to support free software, don't use too free a license. Disallowing proprietary use gives free software an edge over proprietary programs. In theory with some licenses re-usage of your code must credit your original. But re-usage is difficult to proof and some corporations might just not credit you. However, if you do want to spread your software as wide as possible, i.e you don't care about proprietary products using your software, then use MIT or LGPL. If in doubt use the more restrictive license and add a line, saying you may consider permitting uses outside of the license terms on a by-case basis. This way commercial users with a project worthy of your work have a chance.\nBottom line - copyright dispute: Include as much information as you dare to make proving it's really your brainchild easier. Have a lawsuit over the ownership in the back of your head. Poor man's copyright is mailing a printed copy of your source to your home address. If the envelope is unbroken, the postmark is valid evidence at court and provides a date and a verified address. An e-mail instead of your full name to identify you should be okay and sufficient proof but: Better safe, than sorry.\n\nA: At the end of the GPLv2 license, there's a guide on how to apply the license terms to your project. The FSF put a lot of effort into writing that document and making it as legally valid as possible, so I'd follow their advice.\nIf you decide to use the GPL license, please make sure that you include the 'version 2 or later' clause. This will save you headaches later, and make GPLv2 projects compatible with GPLv3 and vice-versa.\nLike Oli said, you don't legally need to use your real name or your email in the header of a file to keep your copyright rights, but it's highly recommended to save you and other people from headaches later on.\nDeciding between the GPL license and the MIT license is both an ethical and strategic decision, and there are many arguments in favour of either one.\n\nA: I should prefix this with: I am not a copyright lawyer. If you're really concerned about something, contact one. People at the FSF might be able to help you.\n\nYou should include the full text of the license. Even if you just stick it in a LICENSE file at the root of the project. I don't think anything immediately bad would happen if you didn't but in the long term (which copyright is), not having a solid reference to your license could be a bad thing.\nBeing explicit doesn't cost very much time.\nEdit: actually the WARRANTY section might be worth including for your protection, whichever license you choose. I have no evidence to say that not including it implies a warranty, but again, be safe, not sorry.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE\nAUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,\nOUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN\nTHE SOFTWARE. \n\n\nA copyright notice (© <date> <name>) isn't legally required in most places anymore but not including it doesn't help anyone. You'd have a harder time proving you owned copyright and it would be a lot harder for people who want to license it under different terms. I would definitely put it in there... But I guess this isn't really an issue with BSD/MIT -style licenses.\nAs for using a handle or nick, in other medias people have been using pseudonames for centuries. If it came to a legal suit, you'd need to be able to prove you are that person so obviously this might make it a little harder but it's not insurmountable.\nIf you're going MIT, you have so little legal recourse that these issues will probably never apply to you.\n\nThe year in the copyright notice isn't essential but if you wanted to sue somebody in several decades time, you'd have to prove when it was created. Which might be hard. A fixed notice helps you and costs nothing but a few seconds.\n\nWe should be clear here.\n\n\n*\n\n*GPL allows commercial redistribution but the source code of the whole thing must be available (with changes) to anyone who purchases a copy of it .\n\n*LGPL is good for software libraries. These can be included in proprietary projects without needing to redistribute the whole source. The only time source distribution needs to happen is if they edit your code and even then, they only have to release their changes to it.\n\n*MIT code can be relicensed freely. Somebody could take your code, verbatim, and re-release it under GPL, proprietary licenses, etc.\n\n\n\"GPL vs MIT\" is an eternal battle. Go with whatever you're actually happiest with, not what is most convenient. If you're not happy for potentially evil people to take your code and use it for potentially evil or lucrative purposes, use something where you have some recourse like GPL. If you really don't care and you're not using any GPL'd code yourself, a more liberal license like MIT would be fine.\nRemember virally-open-source licenses aren't just good for you, they ensure that your work, however it's adapted and re-released is free for everybody under the same terms. Even if you're dumping the code with no interest in maintaining it, GPL gives it a better hope of remaining free.\nThere's no need to rush it these decisions either but you have to think of the worst possible cases to really know if you're making the right decision. Once it's released under one of these licenses, that's it, it's done.\n\nA: \nDo I have to include the whole license with my project or is a comment [...] legally sufficient?\n\nNo need to get clever. Just follow the guidelines. You should generally include the GPL license header with each of the scripts you're adding. Add or confirm the full text of the GPL exists in a file called COPYING and is included in the source. If you're trying to include GPL scripts in a broader Expat licensed work you cannot as the compatability does not work in that direction.\n\nDo I have to include my real name or is an e-Mail or other alias legally waterproof?\n\nNothing is water-tight where law is concerned. If your name is Satoshi Nakamoto probably use something else to more uniquely identify yourself. It can be a moniker, pen name or even a Bitcoin address.\n\nIs the year important? I would guess 'yes' as copyrights expire in most countries after a certain period. What happens if I don't?\n\nYes, though without it it may take others longer to reasonably determine the year of copyright expiration.\n\nShould I use GPL over MIT?\n\nYes, since that's what you stated you were asked to do. In a more general sense the permissive nature of Expat may come back to bite you.\n", "Q: Can Totem play from last position only for videos? I have Totem player configured in its options to resume playback from the last position. But it does this for both video and audio files. But, I want it only for the video files so I can resume from where I left off, but not for music files. I want music files to start from the beginning always. Is there any way to force this?\nCurrently I have to use a separate music player, but I don't really want another player just for music.\n\nA: From what I can see, no. You'd need to edit the source code and add the functionality yourself.

The files contain the wlan interface MAC address, and I also had to correct that to make it work.\nThe following procedure worked for me to import the wireless configs from my old 12.04 system to the new 16.04 installation.\n# Stop Network Manager\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\n\n# copy the files from your old system (adapt as needed)\nsudo rsync -va -c \"/media/$YOUR_OLD_SYSTEM/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\" /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\n\n# Get your new MAC address, and verify it is right.\n# For example, this should work if you have only one wireless interface\nexport MAC=$(iw dev | grep addr | awk '{print $2}')\necho \"$MAC\"\n\n# Replace the MAC address in all the system-connections files\nsudo perl -i.bak -pe 's/^(mac-address=)(.*)/$1$ENV{MAC}/' /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*\n\n# Restart NetworkManager, and wait for nm-applet to also start and connect    \nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager start\n\n# Delete the backup files with the old MAC addresses\nsudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.bak\n\nIf for some reason you would like to keep the original timestamps of your system-connections files instead of the timestamp when you changed the MAC address, here is an alternative which assumes that you have 2 separate folders with your old and current connection files:\nold=/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections.old\nnew=/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\nfor f in $old/*; do b=\"$(basename \"$f\")\"; perl -pe 's/^(mac-address=)(.*)/$1$ENV{MAC}/' \"$f\" > \"$new/$b\"; touch -r \"$f\" \"$new/$b\"; done\n\n\nA: Your passwords are stored in ~/.gnome2/keyrings. By default, they are protected with your login password. If you copy that folder to your new system and use the same login password, then you should have all of your passwords, including your wifi connections. \nYour Passwords\nYou can see your passwords in the Passwords and Encryption Keys application. They should be under a keyring called login. You can search for \"Network secret\" to show only wifi passwords.\nmv ~/.gnome2/keyrings ~/old_keyrings\ncp ~/backup/keyrings ~/.gnome2/keyrings\n\nHowever, for network manager to use your password, it needs a gconf setting with a matching id number. You can do this two ways: copy your old gconf settings or create new connections and change their id numbers.\nCopy your old gconf settings\nThis is really simple:\n# network-manager will overwrite your changes if you don't terminate it\nsudo stop network-manager\n# back up old settings\nmv ~/.gconf/system/networking/connections ~/old_connections\ncp /media/old_install/.gconf/system/networking/connections  ~/.gconf/system/networking/connections\nsudo start network-manager\n\nUnfortunately, this method didn't work for me. My test case is abnormal, so hopefully it works for you.\nCreate new connections\nIf the above doesn't work for you, then on your old machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Passwords and Encryption Keys\n\n*right click on your default keychain\n\n*select change password\n\n*set the password to blank\n\n*copy the ~/.gnome2/keyrings/default.keyring to ~/old_passwords.keyring\n\n*Now you can connect to networks and look up passwords in ~/old_passwords.keyring (since you removed the password, it will be a plain-text file).\n\n\n(You could also create connections and modify their uuid to match the existing password, but that's too much work unless you can script it.)\n\nA: On my 12.04 system the WiFi connections and passwords (in the clear) were stored in text files in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\nStopping the network manager, copying these files to the new machine, restoring the permissions and restarting network manager worked for me.\nsudo stop network-manager\nsudo cp /backup/path/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\nsudo chown root.root /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*\nsudo start network-manager\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Shut down NetworkManager\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\npkill nm-applet\n\n\n*Copy ${HOME}/.gconf/system/networking/connections/\n\n*Restart network-manager:\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager start\n\nPress Alt+F2 and enter nm-applet --sm-disable to start the applet.\nMight be a litte out of date.\n\nA: JoliCloud is based on 10.04, so I'd assume that it is using Network Manager to organize wireless passwords. Much of that configuration is stored in .gconf/system/networking/ -- Not sure if the passwords are stored there or elsewhere.\n\nA: Extending the solution from Pablo Bianchi on Ubuntu 20.04, I simply had to remove the MAC-adress after copying:\ncd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\nservice NetworkManager stop\nsed -i -e 's/mac-address=.*$/mac-address=/' -- *\nservice NetworkManager start\n\n", "Q: UK Keyboard Layout doesn't show up I've the latest Ubuntu version working on my desktop.

X just wasn't designed with isolation in mind.\nFor the curious or paranoid, read Secure Linux Desktop and Passive and active attacks via X11. Is Wayland any better?. For the extremely paranoid, check out Qubes, which is based on virtualized Linux instances, each running its own X server.\nIf you're concerned about running untrusted X applications, you must run them on a separate X display, in addition to running them as a different user (or better, in a different (virtual) machine). You can run a separate X server and display it in a nested X window in various ways: through a virtual machine (VirtualBox, VMware, …), with a remote X server such as VNC which you just happen to connect to locally, or with a special-purpose X-in-X program such as Xnest or Xephyr.\nIf you're concerned about social engineering attacks, that's a different problem.

I have an Ubuntu server on Amazon EC2, that I use for development, and today I stupidly cleared everything out of my ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.  Luckily I have an SSH open, so I am still connected, and can fix the file, but when I try to put my key file back, it doesn't work.  I still get permission denied from the server on my local machine.  \nauthorized_keys has the permissions 600. I have tried appending my SSH key with ssh-rsa and leaving the ssh-rsa off.  I also tried making the SSH key all one line, but that didn't work either.\nIs there something else that I have to do like reload the file some how?\n\nA: I thought I can contribute to this since it is about AWS instances specifically and all the answers only treat the problem as a Linux issue, as if it was a piece of hardware. First thing you need to understand is that you should never, ever, don't treat EC2 instances as hardware. That's just going to create more work for you Treat them as volatile. That's the biggest hurdle I see people having with AWS.\nMake an AMI of your instance and inject the key you need into the new instance. cloud-init will take care of it for you.\nIn more detail all you have to do is use the correct public key when creating the new instance out of the AMI of the original.\nIf, like in the comments of the approved answer you want to generate your own key pair of pub and pem files AWS provides you with the option to upload your public keys for use in EC2.\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws\n\nA: Get a shell on the remote machine where you want to put the key and then you can run this one-liner to create the necessary files and directories, set their permissions and append the key to the file. Of course you have to change the KEYGOESHERE part below and the comment after it.\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && echo \"ssh-rsa KEYGOESHERE user@remotehost or note\" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\nA: local> scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub remote.com:\nlocal> ssh remote.com\nremote> cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys\nremote> rm id_rsa.pub\nremote> exit\n\n\nA: After saving public key you should save the private key into a directory and file on your pc. And in the auth section of ssh on putty you should point to the private key file that you saved on your desktop. It will work. It works for me.\n\nA: You should never save the file with its contents starting with -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- on the server, that is your private key. Instead, you must put the public key into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.\nThis public key has the .pub extension when generated using ssh-keygen and its contents begin with ssh-rsa AAAAB3. (The binary format is described in the answers to this question).\nThe permissions of ~/.ssh on the server should be 700. The file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (on the server) is supposed to have a mode of 600. The permissions of the (private) key on the client-side should be 600.\nIf the private key was not protected with a password, and you put it on the server, I recommend you to generate a new one:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nYou can skip this if you're fully sure that nobody can recover the deleted private key from the server.\nIf this does not help, run ssh with options for more verbosity:\nssh -vvv user@example.com\n\nOn the server side, you can review /var/log/auth.log for details.\n\nA: An alternative way to install your public key in the remote machine's authorized_keys:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh USER@HOST \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nSome advantages:\n\n*\n\n*does not require ssh-copy-id to be installed.\n\n\n*guarantees that mkdir works before attempting to append id_rsa.pub to  authorized_keys.\n\nThere is a chance that a newly created authorized_keys file or .ssh folder will not have the correct file permissions. This may result in ssh attempting to fallback to password authentication (if it is still enabled).\nTo fix this, log back in the server and run:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nSee this answer for more details, as well as the other answer to this question.\n\nA: Easiest way is to copy and paste...\nFirst view/copy the contents of your local public key id_rsa.pub including the beginning \"ssh-rsa\" until it ends with your email address:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nThen edit authorized_keys on the server and paste contents of your clipboard below any other keys in that file: \nnano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nAnd save Ctl+O, exit the file Ctl+X, exit the SSH session exit and try logging back in to confirm it worked. If it didn't ask for a password it worked.\n\nA: If you have login based authentication then use ssh-copy-id to append your public keys to remote server.\nssh-copy-id user@host\n\n\nA: Here's a variation whereby you might have a list of public key filenames in a text file and the big batch of public key files are also in the same directory.\nThis variation can be helpful if you were giving a huge list of public key files to import :-)\n$ for i in $(cat ListOfPubKeyFiles.txt) ; do cat $i | ssh User@Hostname \"cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"; done\n\n", "Q: How to permanently change the time in Ubuntu Server I have changed the time in Ubuntu Server 11.04 but when i reboot it resets to the default it has.

The easiest way to fix this is to reconfigure the tzdata package sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\nThere are alternative ways, like symlinking the correct zonefile from /usr/share/zoneinfo to /etc/localtime which will inform the system of the proper time:\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\n\nHowever, it's preferred to use dpkg-reconfigure\n", "Q: Broken sudo: can't open /etc/sudoers: No such file or directory I have a live USB persistent version of Ubuntu 11.04 installed with Unetbootin.\nAfter some time I experienced some bugs while upgrading the kernel and trying to use my second screen on my laptop.

I need to format a drive containing an old install of Ubuntu 10.04, to install Vista (not my idea!) Vista setup apparently refuses to format non-FAT32 or NTFS partitions. However, I can't seem to format it from my live CD (Ubuntu 11.04) at all; I keep getting \"device is busy\" errors. What is the simplest way to format this drive?\n\nA: From a live session start Gparted Partition Editor from System -> Administration:\n\nChoose the drive you need to re-partition or format from the top right. Then select your partition (in this case /dev/sda1). By right click on the partition a menu pops up that lets you choose to Delete or Format this partition.\nPartitions need to be unmounted before changing them\nIn case you install another OS it may be sufficient to just delete all partitions leaving the drive unpartitioned. Partitoning and formatting will then be done by the new OS's installer. \nWe have to keep in mind that private data on that drive will still be recoverable after deleting or reformatting partitions.\n\nA: The simplest way, I would argue, is to put the Windows Vista DVD in the drive and start the installation process.\nThe Windows Vista DVD should be capable of formatting the disk to the Windows native partition(s) (NTFS or FAT32) you require for Windows installation.\nThis will cut out one step in the process.\nIs that an option for you?

In this case, does debian/prg//usr/share/prg exist? I'd wager not.  Conventionally, the files for a package are built up either in debian/tmp (typical for 1:1 source:binary packages) or debian/binary-package-name (better for 1:n source:binary packages), so trying to copy from one convention to another suggests an error.\nCheck your debian/*install file(s). see also the dh_install(1) manpage.

I told the Banshee database to look for my music in the location of the symlink. If I ever want to change the location of my music again, all I have to do is move my files and update the location of the symlink.\n\nA: I have moved my Music from one system to another and I have also moved from one LVM to another LVM.\nOne move I completed was an scp from my laptop (Ubuntu) to my desktop (Windows) and all the information including the metadata of each of my songs were great.\nI then did another copy from LVM volume to another LVM volume using the following command:\nsudo cp -a ./Music/* /mnt/tmpMusic/\n\nI am using that new copied Music folder for Banshee as we speak with no metadata problems.\nBefore you move all your music from one folder to another, just do a small test for one song move to a new directory.

I could keep using AVIDEMUX if I can get it working better, or some other app, preferrably as easy as it. With OpenVideo, besides taking a long time re-encoding the video, I frequently do bad codec selection and mess up output quality, plus it will force the output to some predefined size, which sometimes do not match the input.\nThanks!\n\nA: I recommend openshot which i use to cut parts of several videos and them put the videos together (Very good when you want to make Ubuntu Tutorials)\n\n\n*\n\n*Add openshot ppa: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonoomph/openshot-edge \n\n*Update repository: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install openshot: sudo apt-get install openshot (Or look in the Software Center or Synaptic)\nyou will find openshot in the Sound & Video Menu.

Make sure you know what are you doing while dealing with system files.\n", "Q: Why can other users see the files in my home folder? I just added a new, underprivileged \"desktop user,\" and I was surprised to discover that it can see the files in my home folder.\nWhat is the rational for setting up such lax permissions?\n\nA: You can read the User Management section of the Ubuntu Server Guide which covers the necessary details. The User Profile Security paragraph will probably answer your questions - officially.\n\nA: A Public folder exists in your Home directory (/home/user) for sharing files with other users. If an other user wants to get access to this Public folder, the execute bit for the world should be set on the Home directory.\nIf you do not need to allow others to access your home folder (other humans or users like www-data for a webserver), you'll be fine with chmod o-rwx \"$HOME\" (remove read/write/execute from \"other\", equivalent to chmod 750 \"$HOME\" since the default permission is 750). Otherwise, you should change the umask setting too to prevent newly created files from getting read permissions for the world by default.\nFor a system-wide configuration, edit /etc/profile; per-user settings can be configured in ~/.profile. I prefer the same policy for all users, so I'd edit the /etc/profile file and append the line:\numask 027\n\nYou need to re-login to apply these changes, unless you're in a shell. In that case, you can run umask 027 in the shell.\nNow to fix the existing permissions, you need to remove the read/write/execute permissions from other:\nchmod -R o-rwx ~\n\nNow if you decide to share the ~/Public folder to everyone, run the next commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod o+x ~ - allow everyone to descend in the directory (x), but not get a directory listing (r should not be added)\n\n*find ~/Public -type f -exec chmod o+r {} \\; - allow everyone to read the files in ~/Public\n\n*find ~/Public -type d -exec chmod o+rx {} \\; - allow everyone to descend into directories and list their contents\n\n\nIf you are use GNU coreutils (e.g. on Ubuntu, not on a embedded system having only busybox), then the previous two commands using find and chmod can be replaced by this single command that recursively makes folders and files readable (and additionally adds the execute (descend) bit for directories only):\nchmod -R o+rX ~/Public\n\n\nA: According to an Ubuntuforms.org staff member, it is to make it easier to share files between new users.\nYou can change the permission to either 700 or 750 if you don't want the files readable and executable by others.\nCommand is:\nchmod 750 $HOME\n\nNote: Ubuntu default is 755\n\nA: Ubuntu 21.04 and later releases have a secure default, see this blog article (archived link) linked by stackprotector in the comments section:\n\nfor new installations of Ubuntu 21.04, or for users created on a machine that has been upgraded to Ubuntu 21.04,  home directories will be private by default.\n\nHowever, the article implies that users created on Ubuntu < 21.04 will not be fixed automatically, even after applying security updates or upgrading to Ubuntu 21.04 or later. These users can be corrected by hand, with the following commands taken from the article.\nTo fix all existing users:\nsudo chmod 750 /home/*\n\nTo fix the default for users that will be created in the future:\nsudo sed -i s/DIR_MODE=0755/DIR_MODE=0750/ /etc/adduser.conf\necho \"HOME_MODE 0750\" | sudo tee -a /etc/login.defs\n\n\nFor Ubuntu < 21.04:\nAccording to Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical's founder and CEO,\n\n\"The majority of users of Ubuntu systems either have exclusive use of the\nmachine (personal laptop) or are sharing with friends and relatives. We\nassume that the people who share the machine are either trusted, or in a\nposition to hack the machine (boot from USB!) trivially. As a result,\nthere is little to no benefit\"\n\n... from removing those permissions.\n\nA: I think Lekensteyn's answer can be improved by replacing the last two find commands with chmod using -X option (note the capital X).  The two find commands can be replaced with \nchmod -R o+rX ~/Public\nThis differentiates appropriately between files and directories, but does have the additional effect of allowing others to run executable files.\n\nA: Since it is privacy that interests you (judging from the tags that were applied) it is very possible that setting permissions is insufficient (see ignis's answer). The answer may be something along the lines of an encrypted home directory. This solution is specifically designed against the attack by another user of a computer. It will, of course, be unable to stop another user from damaging your files (by simply removing ~/.Private directory, thus erasing all of your files), but they will be unable to mount the directory and see the files without your password.\nThe easiest way to achieve that is during the installation process, there is a check box, stating \"Encrypt your home directory\" and you need to select that.\nSince it is unlikely that you will want to reinstall just for that (and because it still carries all the risks that are entailed with doing it without reinstall), you can do the following:\nsudo apt-get install encryptfs-utils\nencryptfs-migrate-home\n\n\nA: If you really need a high level of security: please re-install and make sure to choose the option to encrypt your entire disk. This will require a passphrase to even start the machine. You may of course also encrypt your home folder once more on top of this, with some performance degradation; though not noticeable for normal use. \nPlease note, that encrypting your home folder will disable applications like Dropbox. Dropbox is not secure storage that respects privacy anyway, so that may be a trite point. However, if you do need secure and private storage in the cloud, I would personally recommend MEGAsync since only you would have the keys to access the data.  \n", "Q: What video capture boards are \"plug-and-play\" compatible? I'm looking for a video capture board that works in Ubuntu without a lot of painful configuration or hassles.\nI'm looking for an external USB-2.0 based capture board and I would prefer one with an onboard MPEG-encoder.\n\nA: Hauppauge HD-PVR solves your problem if you're dealing with analog video.

I want to set such environ vars that both Eclipse IDE and Maven CLI will see them. I know I can make an eclipse.sh wrapper, so everything can be executed from a shell, but I want to know whether this question is possible.\n\nA: \nSystem-wide environment variables\n\nEnvironment variable settings that affect the system as a whole (rather then just a particular user) should not be placed in any of the many system-level scripts that get executed when the system or the desktop session are loaded, but into\n/etc/environment - This file is specifically meant for system-wide environment variable settings. It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line. Specifically, this file stores the system-wide locale and path settings.\n\n\nNot recommended:\n\n/etc/profile - This file gets executed whenever a bash login shell is entered (e.g. when logging in from the console or over ssh), as well as by the DisplayManager when the desktop session loads. This is probably the file you will get referred to when asking veteran UNIX system administrators about environment variables. In Ubuntu, however, this file does little more then invoke the /etc/bash.bashrc file.\n/etc/bash.bashrc - This is the system-wide version of the ~/.bashrc file.

G'day,\nso 2 days ago, I went to bed with my internet working but when I woke up it wasn't. When I had a closer look last night, it seems syslog suggests that DHCP request times out?! \nThis was not happening just a couple of days ago. I'm not sure if the computer rebooted/updated during the night, but I think it didn't (movie still playing). The ethernet port light does not blink (green is ALWAYS on now, red/orange never blinks). \nWhat could the problem be here? \n[Not at my computer right now, might take a while to print responses from terminal]\nEdit1: my eth0 lists an IPv6 address but not a IPv4 address, and I've set IPv6 to 'ignore', could that be an issue?\n\nA: You can check to see the status of a DCHP update by running this in a terminal:\nsudo dhclient eth0 # assuming eth0 is your network adapter\n\nThat will try and get the network settings up and going and it will tell you what it's trying to do (so if it does make contact and then fails, you should see the result). If it doesn't make contact, you'll see it going on and on and on.\nBefore we get too ahead of ourselves though, you should make sure that this isn't a physical issue. That you think the lights are displaying in a strange way should be an indicator that there could be a problem either with the cable or the ports at either end of it. Some tests for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try turning it off then on again. \n\n*If you have another network adapter on this computer, try it.\n\n*If the router has another port, try it.\n\n*If you have a spare cable, chuck it in.\n\n*If you have (or can borrow, buy or steal) another computer, try that on this network connection.\n\n*Make sure nobody dropped the internet. Okay, that's enough IT Crowd. Sorry, I couldn't resist.\n\n\nGetting back the woes of DHCP, our DHCP server here sometimes goes flying down in a burst of flames. For the computers that are assigned IPs by it (semi-statically, in that they should always have the same IP), I moved them to fully-static configurations without much hassle.\nIf it's running Network Manager (as most Ubuntu desktops do) you want a configuration that looks something like the following screenshot. DNS is optional but I find using Google's DNS server lets me troubleshoot one less thing when the router has a hissy-fit. Gateway is probably the most important thing for routing traffic properly.\n\nIf it's a server or you've ripped out Network Manager, the manual configuration lives in /etc/network/interfaces so you want to run sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces and paste in a configuration like this one. If you're still running Network Manager, as soon as it starts running, it's going to alter this configuration to whatever it wants to. If you're running Network Manager, use the other config.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.0.4\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network 192.168.0.0\n        broadcast 192.168.0.255\n        gateway 192.168.0.1\n\nSame applies to the gateway. Get it right or you can't contact the outside world. As for the IP you pick. In either of these cases, you need to make sure you're picking something that isn't assigned by DHCP. An IP conflict can very quickly knacker any connectivity.\n\nA: Your computer is just a DHCP client, it requests an IP address from a DHCP server (typically your home router). So I suggest you to look in the logs of your router if you've access to it.\nThe IPv6 addrss you're seeing is possibly a link-local address which is always set if you're connected.\n\nA: One of the most useful tools I have found for diagnosing some types of cable faults is mii-tool. mii-tool alows you to reset the cable auto detection setup with out actually pulling the cable in and out. This then triggers all the relevant events on ubuntu and it will re-request you DHCP, and other configuration settings. \nTo get details about your current set up simply \n\nsudo mii-tool -V  #to get details about your current device setup\n\nTo reset the network device  \n\nsudo mii-tool -R  #to reset the device status(check that the cable is in)\n  sudo mii-tool -r  #to restart auto negotiation.(set up the speed used by the cable)  \n\nWith the cable connected mine outputs, and shows every thing is in working correctly.\n  $ sudo mii-tool -v\neth1: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok\n  product info: vendor 00:07:32, model 17 rev 2\n  basic mode:   autonegotiation enabled\n  basic status: autonegotiation complete, link ok\n  capabilities: 1000baseT-HD 1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD\n  advertising:  100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control\n  link partner: 1000baseT-HD 1000baseT-FD 100baseTx-FD 100baseTx-HD 10baseT-FD 10baseT-HD flow-control\n\n", "Q: Installation stops at a black screen on a Dell XPS 15z This is my first time trying to install a Linux distro, and I'm having a bit of a time with it.

I can see the option --pid-owner on the man page of iptables on die.net, but it says it is broken with SMP :(\nIn my own system, a 10.04, there is no such option on the manual :( . So I believe we are out of luck this time ;( . Maybe there will be another incarnation of the --pid-owner option some time in the future. A gui on top of that would not be rocket science.\nThe first step must be taken on Linux itself and iptables.\nAs for more specific types of traffic, such as HTTP. There should be ways to make accommodations using proxies, but it probably needs some hacking because this use-case does not arise often.\n\nA: It's not particularly helpful, but the only way (I know of) to truly limit bandwidth effectively is using packet shaping or queuing technology.

Any help would be awesome! Thanks!\n\nA: Use ipconfig in a dos shell to get the ip address. On Ubuntu use ifconfig in a terminal to get the same.\nNow try to ping your boxen. If they ping then you know that they are 'on the same network'.\nYou can also put the IP address in the explorer window address bar on the Windows PC. If you have your shares etup correctly on Ubuntu machine it will show them.\nA more useful tool from the Ubuntu box is zenmap. You have to run it as root and install nmap dependency. This lets you see everything visible on your network, even if you cannot see it normally as it is a clever network scanning tool.\nEstablish the basic connectivity, make sure your shares are setup, make sure they can be found by IP and then you will be part way there.\nAnother thing is you need DHCP rather than static IPs unless you want lots of 'hosts' files in your boxen.\n\nA: When networking with Vista and Windows 7, you need to disable all of the security within the network settings of all windows machines.  The \"HomeGroup\" function adds a type of authentication that will not function with the Samba client that Ubuntu uses to access Windows shares.  Turning all this off will allow you to browse.

As of now, I used IBM Pro printer II and PPD for Epson dot matrix printers as driver since my printer is not supported out of the box. In both cases, I am unable to do a fast printing using the default fonts in the printer. The printer gets text in bit-map/graphics so the print is time consuming.\nSo I would like to know how I can have the default printing font changed to use the built-in fonts in printer which will print super fast?\nWhere I can do this change - Firefox or CUPS so that the data sent will be in a font either matching with printer default or just raw data so that printer default font used?\nI already played around with printer setup and it does not look like I have an option there and the font I chose there get overridden by font sent by application.\nI believe cups has some setup on choosing this. A command line printout (from terminal doing a lp testfile is also using some font other than default built-in Draft/Roman/San Serif of the printer. Any pointer to right direction is appreciated. A similar question on Stackoverflow: How can I send raw data to a printer in Mozilla Firefox? (Raw Print) did not help me.\nUpdate: With setting up the printer as a raw printer, I could get very fast printing from a terminal (lp mytextfile). With this setting, the OS (Ubuntu 10.10) sent raw text data and printer used its font (built-in one in ROM) to print it.

Is there a way to share my desktop Internet connection with my Android 2.2.1 using the phone data cable?\n\nA: There are some old notes on Reverse USB Tethering with Android 2.2 with a Nexus One.  \nI've been planning to try this without rooting my HTC DHD.\nIt has an Internet Pass-through option which works great on Windows,\nSo, I wonder if this can be used on the same lines through Ubuntu...\nNot tried yet -- would love to know of any first-hand experience. \nRequirements from those notes are, \n\nAndroid 2.2 (or an older version with a root tethering app)\n      ADB from Android SDK, or a rooted Android 2.2 with terminal in root mode\n\n\nA: Well, it can be done with rooted 2.2+ devices. It's not simple.\nBefore I start, you might just find it easier to buy a cheap USB Wifi dongle and share the connection to your phone through that. It's a much more simple procedure and doesn't require root on the phone.\nBut here's how to do it over USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your phone in USB debugging mode (in settings → applications → usb). Plug the phone in.\n\n*Then you need to turn on USB tethering on the phone. On my SGS2, this sits in Settings → Wireless and network → Tethering and portable hotspots.\nAt this point, a new network device will be added to the computer (usb0).\n\n*Fire off the following commands to bridge eth0 and your new USB connection.\nsudo apt-get install bridge-utils\n\nsudo brctl addbr br0\n\nfor i in eth0 usb0; do\n    sudo ifconfig $i 0.0.0.0\n    sudo brctl addif br0 $i\ndone\n\nsudo ifconfig br0 up\nsudo dhclient br0 # might take a few seconds\n\n\n*Then load a terminal on your phone (or use the SDK adb shell) and fire off (as root):\nnetcfg usb0 dhcp\n\nTo reverse it all:\nfor i in eth0 usb0 br0; do sudo ifconfig $i down; done\nsudo brctl delbr br0\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nTo make things slightly easier there are a few Apps out there that do the phone side of things (ASProxy for example) but you still need a rooted 2.2 device. The computer side of things can be scripted. You could even hook into udev to fire these commands off when you plug the phone in (and destroy the bridge when you unplug it).\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu Music to sync my existing collection?

I have several ISO images that I want to install in the USB like Ubuntu, Fedora, System Rescue CD, Windows XP and Windows 7 (The windows versions are optional, mostly am looking for a multi installer for Linux distros, specially Ubuntu version)\nThe default Startup Disk Creator only works with Linux Images and only 1 at a time (At least for the mean time. If it allows more systems and multiple ISOs it would be awesome)\nWhat method exists that I can use step by step to create a bootable USB Drive with multiple images than can be booted from the USB and selected from GRUB. It must support Windows Images and Linux Images.\nAlternatively, is there also a way to have multiple versions of the Ubuntu installation ISO on same USB Drive, such as, when booting from it, I get to choose what Ubuntu version and architecture to install, for example:\n\nBOOT MENU\n  Ubuntu 12.04 32 Bit\n  Ubuntu 12.04 64 Bit\n  Ubuntu 12.10 32 Bit\n  Ubuntu 12.10 64 Bit\n\nUPDATE: Wanted to add that the English version for the post mentioned by daithib8 is here: MultiSystem – Create a MultiBoot USB from Linux | USB Pen Drive Linux\n\nA: You can loop mount isofiles directly with GRUB2 by installing it to the MBR of the USB drive. You can also create UEFI bootable USB drives this way or combine both methods.\nMost of the other solutions are MBR/legacy PC specific and don't work reliably on UEFI machines. \nI recommend reading the documentation on the project site and related manpages (grub-install, grub-mkimage).\n\nEdit 1: I extended my answer to a similar question a while ago. Section 2 is about loop mounting one image, mounting several Ubuntu images like in the question can be done by copying and modifying the menu entry or picking the appropriate template for another distribution from the article in the Arch Wiki. MultiSystem proposed in another answer, should be very similar as it also utilizes GRUB's loop mounting capability.\nEdit 2: Speaking of MultiSystem, the package cannot currently be installed on newer versions of Ubuntu due to the following error in the gtkdialog dependency:\ninstall-info: warning: no info dir entry in `/usr/share/info/gtkdialog.info.gz'\n\nIt seems that the format for these files has changed, here is an excerpt from the gzip info file for comparison:\nINFO-DIR-SECTION Compression\nSTART-INFO-DIR-ENTRY\n* Gzip: (gzip).                 General (de)compression of files (lzw).\nEND-INFO-DIR-ENTRY\n\ngtkdialog is unmaintained and was removed from Debian a long time ago with the advice to application developers to move to alternative solutions. MultiSystem still seems to be under active development, but yet still depends on gtkdialog, someone should approach the developers, I don't speak French though.\n\n\nA: MultiBootUSB is my favorite multiboot drive maker. \nIt will make a USB drive that can boot over 150 distros, it is based on grub2 iso boot and is very easy to use. \nUbuntu versions and derivatives can each have there own persistence file. Persistence is not available in other multiboot drive creators.\nSundar_Ima has done a great job on this utility.\nThere is both Linux and Windows versions.\nMy first MultiBootUSB drive is still in use after seven years.\n\nA: A solution tested from Ubuntu 20.04 and later is to use Ventoy. Directly from the tool description:\n\nVentoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files.\nWith ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the image files to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy many iso files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them.\nBoth Legacy BIOS and UEFI are supported in the same way.\nBoth MBR and GPT partition style are supported in the same way.\n\nI have created a bootable USB where I have copied my ISO files simply with a copy/paste procedure, so that they are shown in a menu when the USB stick is used as a bootable drive. At the same time, I can use this USB also to store my personal data (they do not appear in the Ventoy Menu).\nThis means that when I use this USB stick as a bootable drive I have a menu like this (screenshot taken from the official website):\n\nWhen I open it via Nautilus, it is like a normal USB stick where you can put your files (screenshot taken from my Ubuntu 20.04):\n\nVentoy does not come in a deb format or with an installation script, so you need to download Ventoy from the release page. If you download the .tar.gz version (I'll refer to version 1.0.61 in the following examples), you can extract it by issuing in the terminal:\nsudo tar xzf ventoy-1.0.61-linux.tar.gz -C /opt\nConsidering the meaning of /opt folder, I think that /opt is the best choice in terms of destination folder.\nNow, you need to give permissions to at least Ventoy2Disk.sh and VentoyGUI.x86_64:\nsudo chmod +x /opt/ventoy-1.0.61/Ventoy2Disk.sh /opt/ventoy-1.0.61/VentoyGUI.x86_64\nNow you are ready to use it. To create a bootable USB mapped as /dev/usb (always use lsblk to identify correctly your USB disk!) with a GPT partitioning, you can run\nsudo bash /opt/ventoy-1.0.61/Ventoy2Disk.sh -I -g /dev/sdb\nFollowing, the list of parameters provided by Ventoy2Disk.sh:\nVentoy2Disk.sh CMD [ OPTION ] /dev/sdX\n  CMD:\n    -i   install ventoy to sdX (fail if disk already installed with ventoy)\n    -I   force install ventoy to sdX (no matter installed or not)\n    -u   update ventoy in sdX\n    \n  OPTION: (optional)\n   -r SIZE_MB  preserve some space at the bottom of the disk (only for install)\n   -s          enable secure boot support (default is disabled)\n   -g          use GPT partition style, default is MBR style (only for install)\n\nOtherwise, you can run Ventoy with a graphical interface using:\nsudo /opt/ventoy-1.0.61/VentoyGUI.x86_64\nFurther details are available in Ventoy Installation.\nAnother interesting source is this article from RedHat.com: Creating a multi-boot Linux desktop system\n\nA: Creating and installing Multiple Distros in to USB / Pendrive involves two parts:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating Multiple Live distro Using Multicd.sh. From the link:\n\n\n\"After googling around for few days i found this useful script from www.multicd.tuxfamily.org.

While executing, this script will download few packages from Internet and make a new iso image called multicd.iso for you inside multicd folder. Check the size of multicd.iso image file. If it exceeds more than 700 mb then you must insert DVD to write it. Choose burn image option from your favorite image burning software to write multicd.iso file. Upon reboot, with the CD/DVD present inside CD/DVD drive, new GRUB will display list of live distros available in the disc. Choose your favorite one to login...\nNote: When you download any Linux iso image from internet it will look like this \"ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386\" but this has to be renamed as ubuntu.iso (inside multicd folder). Presently this script supports 20 live distros. List of Live Linux distros supported in this script are given below (and the names accepted by this script are on the right side of each distro).\"\nThere's a list of distro's on the blog page.\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Multiple Live distro in to a USB / Pendrive.\nUNetbootin  allows you to create bootable Live USB drives for Ubuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions without burning a CD. It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can either let UNetbootin download one of the many distributions supported out-of-the-box for you, or supply your own Linux .iso file if you've already downloaded one or your preferred distribution isn't on the list.\nSupport amongst others: Ubuntu (and official derivatives) 8.04 LTS 9.10 10.04 LTS 10.10 11.04 Daily CD Images, Fedora 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, Rawhide and lots lots more.\nIf you look at them image you can choose distro's or download ISO's yourself and add them or add a custom. And you can set this up on a hard disc or a USB flash drive.\n\nI hope it is enough information but there is a lot more info on this blog.\n\nA: OK, this is what i did to run Xubuntu From a SD card it applies to USB sticks too it's really simple actually , though i used only (x)Ubuntu, i'm prety sure it works for other Distro's, not so sure if it will work using Windows.\nFirst we need 2 USB sticks, one for the liveCD's and the other to install the OS.\nSince you want multiple OS's in it, you should use a 16 or 32 GB USB stick, if possible use a USB 3.0 because transfer rates from a 2.0 device are quite slow, eg. i used a 8GB class 2 SD card to install Xubuntu, and it while it wasn't crawling, it didn't fly, though SD cards are slower than USB, for the livecd you can use a 1 or 2 GB drive.\nOk, now make a liveUSB bootable drive, i recommend you to use UNetbootiN, to do this, pick the iso and create the liveUSB.\nNow, that you have the bootable USB, reboot your PC and start the liveUSB, once you're in there start the live session.\nOnce you're in connect the second USB to the PC and format it to EXT4, then simply point the installer to the USB drive and that's it ( i went a little on the extreme side, and disconnected all of my Hard drives to avoid grub being insalled on them or messing the existing installations).\nAdding more distro's is just a matter of creating more partitions, though i don't know if USB's just as Regular Hard Drives , can only hold up to a certain number of Extended partitions, though you can share the /home, swap, i don't really know if /boot can be shared too or if it's safe to do so.\nAs to adding Windows to the USB device, maybe JUST maybe, if you create an NTFS partition and install Windows in it, and then restore GRUB to add Windows to it, it may work.\n\nA: YUMI (2018)\nYUMI now has a version for BIOS boot and a beta version for UEFI boot.\nYUMI meets the OP's criteria for multi booting ISO images.\nIt is straight forward and easy to understand and use.\nThe boot menu is actually syslinux, but is similar to grub2.\nOne advantage of YUMI is that with a NTFS install, the individual casper-rw persistence files can be over 4GB each.\nDownload - https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\nYUMI is a Windows application and is said to run in Wine, but I did not have much luck with that.\n\nA: MULTI FULL INSTALL\nThings have changed since 2011, flash drives today are much larger and faster.\nIt is now reasonable to fully install multiple OS's to a flash drive, (or make a hybrid drive with Live, Persistent and Full installs mixed).\nFull installs are more stable and secure than persistent installs, but not as quick to make. They are better at utilizing disk space as no fixed size casper-rw file or partition is required.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create Live installer drive on small flash drive using UNetbootin, Rufus, etc.\n\n*Create GPT partition table on large Target flash drive.\n\n*Make as many ext4 partitions as you have OS. Size should be about 8GB each or larger.\n\n*Boot Live drive, (in UEFI mode), and then insert larger Target drive.\n\n*Click Install Ubuntu icon, (Ubiquity).\n\n*At partitioning selected \"Something else\".\n\n*Choose sdx1 for /. (sdx being the Target drive).\n\n*Install bootloader to root of the Target drive.\n\n*Leave all other partition's format boxes unchecked.\n\n*If you install using Full disk encryption, make sure to remove or disable any internal drives.\n\n*Repeat this with sdx2, sdx3, etc, and the OS's you choose to install.\n\n*After the last install boot the flash drive and do an update-grub. This will add all the OS to grub.cfg\nYou can leave a partition for any ISO's you wish to Live boot or persistent boot, loop mount these using grub.cfg.\nIt looks like this answer may in part duplicate Uri Herrera's answer. his was here first, I will leave this here for whatever additional info it contains.\n\nA:  Knowing what software to get.\nFirst you will need a partition editor like GParted, or KDE Partition Manager.  See this list of partition editors for Linux.  I recommand if you use a GTK base desktop sush as Gnome, Unity, or LXDE. Use Gparted.  If you use a QT base desktop like KDE or LXQT than use the KDE Partition Manager.  \nSecond thing you need is a installer for them like Unetbootin,or you can use the terminal.\nInstalling the software.\nGparted\nClick this link to install Gparted  , find it in the Ubuntu Software Center, or type sudo apt-get install gparted in a terminal. There are more instructions here\nAfter clicking on the link to install Gparted, it should open up the Ubuntu Software center, and all that you need to do is just press the install button.\n\nUnetbootin\nClick this link to install Unetbootin  , find it in the Ubuntu Software Center, or type sudo apt-get install unetbootin in a terminal. There are more instructions here\nAfter clicking on the link to install Unetbootin, it should open up the Ubuntu Software center, and all that you need to do is just press the install button.\nPartitioning the Flashdrive\n\nSee this tutorial for GUI.  See this tutorial for the terminal, NOT RECOMMANDED.\nInstalling the ISO files to each partition.\n\nFor Unetbootin see this tutorial.  For the terminal see the tutorial.\n\nA: UNetbootin - Multi Boot\nThere is some interest in this thread about using UNetbootin as a multibooter, UNetbootin does not boot ISO images or install Windows OS.\nUNetbootin can install to multiple partitions, however the syslinux bootloader must be dealt with.\n\nDivide flash drive into one partition for each OS, Label partitions for clarity.\n\nUse UNetbootin 655 to install OS's to available partitions. using 655 or later should allow drive to boot both BIOS and UEFI\n\nInstall to first partition last, or set boot flag for first partition manually.\n\nCopy Chain.c32 from Syslinux-4.07 package to root of first partition. \nSyslinux-4.03 chain.c32 does not work.\n\nCopy syslinux.cfg as syslinux2.cfg.\n\nReplace the contents of the original syslinux.cfg as shown, adding a chainload entry for each OS.\n\nsudo parted -ls /dev/sdb\n\nsudo lsblk -f /dev/sdb\nConfig does not seem to be working in the Linux version of UNetbootin 655, if you do not want to use the Windows version here is a workaround.\n\nForget syslinux2.cfg and just edit original syslinux.cfg to include chain loading command for other OS.\nWill update post if/when I figure out how to get chain loading working with UEFI, which may not be easy with syslinux.\n\nA: mkusb MULTIBOOT HACK\nMkusb makes a great base for custom boot drive projects because of it's abilities with both BIOS and UEFI. \nThis hack boots multiple ISO files including the Windows installer, and has a grub2 menu.\nGrub2 menuentries for most OS are available using Google Search and are beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nUse mkusb defaults when creating the Persistent USB drive.\n\nUse mkusb persistence defaults if in doubt, partition size can be adjusted later but takes time.\n\nThe DUS Console after install.\n\nGParted before partition modification.\n\nGparted after modification - Overwrite sdb4, the ISO9660 OS partition and sdb5, the ext2 casper-rw partition, with a FAT32 partition for persistence files.\n\nPersistence partition - Create an uniquely name folder for each OS, (that requires persistence)\n\nPersistence folder - Add a casper-rw file and optional home-rw file to each persistence folder. A home-rw file can be made by renaming a casper-rw file. A home-rw file is like a seperate home partition on a Full install, it can be reused after version upgrades.\n\nCreate a folder for the ISO files on the NTFS usbdata partition.\n\nAdd some ISO's to the ISO folder.\n\ngrub.cfg location\n\nEdit grub.cfg to loopmount the ISO files. Include: persistent persistent-path=/<persistent-folder-name>/ if you want persistence.\n\nsudo parted -ls  /dev/sdb\n\nsudo lsblk -f  /dev/sdb\nIf a Windows installer is required it is possibly easiest to start with the mkusb \"extracting Windows installer\" function, (I had to extract the Windows ISO to TAR manually),\n\nAfter installation create a folder for ISO's and if required, folders for persistence, (similar to above procedure).\n\nEdit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to loopmount any ISO's and specify any persistence folders.\n(have not found a way to loopmount a Windows ISO file).\n\nA: The only system I found for a multi-boot boot-stick, without using Windows, is Multisystem. While the documentation is only in French, you can easily install it on Ubuntu using the project's official repo: \nsudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://liveusb.info/multisystem/depot all main' \nwget -q -O - http://liveusb.info/multisystem/depot/multisystem.asc | sudo apt-key add - \n\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install multisystem\n\nIt can do burg, syslinux, grub4dos, plop, Virtualbox, qemu etc., but a basic multiboot stick can be made in 5 minutes by drag and drop for many distros. For Slitaz cooking I had to add a few lines to /boot/grub/menu.lst. From what I read Grub 1 is usually used for a multiboot environment, but this one uses Grub 2. It can be run from the Windows boot menu by using EasyBCD or the Plop boot-manager. \n\nA: I came to know 2 more tools. Named MultiSystem and YUMI.\nMultiSystem installation is very simple, and you can easily install it on Ubuntu using the project's official repo:\nsudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://liveusb.info/multisystem/depot all main' \nwget -q -O - http://liveusb.info/multisystem/depot/multisystem.asc | sudo apt-key add - \n\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install multisystem\n\nThen all you have to is select your USB device and simply drag n drop your ISO's into MultiSystem tool. If DnD doesn't work, you can also click on the Add button. \n\n\n\nYUMI is also simple similar tool. They are providing a .deb file which you can install like this: \nsudo dpkg -i <filename.deb>\n\n\nA: Here is another script/utility which uses less dependency and supports many (multi)distros \nmultibootusb -  Browse Files at SourceForge.net\n\nA: SARDU Multiboot USB and  DVD  supports multiple Linux OS as well as Win7 and Win8 installers, and is discussed at SARDU – Multiboot USB Creator (Windows) | USB Pen Drive Linux.\n\nA: Try Ventoy https://www.ventoy.net/\nRuns in Linux and Windows, and accepts ISOs of both. Couldn't be more simple to use! After installing and running, just drag and drop the ISOs you want to the USB drive.\n\nA: new answer for an old thread\nAfter trying many solutions, among with\n\n\n*\n\n*Multisystem an incredibly complex setup to reach a botched, flawed and mildly working interface\n\n*Yumi more professional approach but doesn't handle UEFI\n\n\nI came to try successfully Easy2boot which has a simple and efficient Linux script to format, build and setup a preformatted USB drive (partition FAT32)\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncompress the downloaded file from the site to a directory, say easy2boot\n\n*Copy your image files (ISO ...) to easy2boot/_ISO/AUTO (the simplest)\n\n*cd easy2boot/_ISO/docs/linux_utils\n\n*run fmt.sh : bash fmt.sh\n\n*easy2boot will show which device it will work on, and ask you if it is correct ... be sure to check this part twice!\nThat's it.\nTry the formatted drive from Ubuntu!

I have three scripts I need to run when I start up my Ubuntu machine, they start services I use in my development environment.\nTo do that, I manually open three terminals and type in the commands.\nIs there any way to create a script that will open three terminals and execute one command in each of these? (Each command should be in a separate terminal window so I can see their output).\n\nA: Instead of hard-coding gnome-terminal, konsole, et cetera, use the Alternatives system. The program that executes the default terminal emulator is:\nx-terminal-emulator\n\nOn my system, it opens a new instance of Konsole every time I execute this command.\nLuckily, the terminals seems to support the -e option for executing a command (I verified it for konsole and gnome-terminal). Arguments after the command are passed to the invoked command. Bash refuses to stay open in my terminal, an additional script is needed to get a terminal:\n#!/bin/sh\n\"$@\"\nexec \"$SHELL\"\n\nIf you've saved the previous script as /home/user/hacky and made it executable, you would run your scripts with:\nx-terminal-emulator -e /home/user/hacky your-script optional arguments here\n\nThe full path is required and /home/user/hacky has to be executable.\nMy previous attempt to run a script in a new terminal window can be found in revision #2, it was before I realised arguments can be passed to x-terminal-emulator.\n\nA: gnome-terminal -- command\nor\nxterm -e command\nor\nkonsole -e command\nPretty much\nterminal -e command\nTo make the terminal stay when the command exits:\nIn konsole there is a --noclose flag.\nIn xterm, there is a -hold flag.\nIn gnome-terminal, go to Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title. Click the Command tab. Select Hold the terminal from the drop-down menu labelled When command exits. You should create a new profile for that and execute with\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=NAMEOFTHEPROFILE -e command\n\nA: UPDATE 17 FEB 2020: this answer is now perhaps obsolete.\nConsider clicking this link and using this other answer of mine instead: Open Terminal with multiple tabs and execute application\n\nAided by @nickguletskii's answer, and my own comment under his answer, and inspired by @grabantot's upvote of my comment, here's my preferred way to do it, especially when I want the terminal to stay open so I can then manually use it.\nEx. usage: this is really useful to add to your startup programs so this script will run, open a terminal, create and name a tab in the terminal, and run a command for you. Or, you can just add a symlink to this script to your desktop. I use this type of approach so I can double-click a single icon on my desktop and have it open up a bunch of terminals (with various tabs named according to what work I'm going to do in them) and programs to set up my programming environment, for instance, for daily work.\nHere's a contrived example, which opens up a single tab, titles it \"test\", then runs the simple command cd /etc; ls inside it. The $SHELL part at the end forces the shell to stay open so you can then see its output and continue using it (I learned this somewhere else on Stack Overflow):\ngnome-terminal --tab --title=\"test\" --command=\"bash -c 'cd /etc; ls; $SHELL'\"\n\nHere's a more complicated example which opens up 3 separate tabs in the same gnome-terminal. This is exactly the type of thing my desktop shortcut does so I can open up a bunch of programming windows at once:\ngnome-terminal --tab --title=\"tab 1\" --command=\"bash -c 'cd /etc; ls; $SHELL'\" --tab --title=\"tab 2\" --command=\"bash -c 'cd ~; ls; $SHELL'\" --tab --title=\"tab 3\" --command=\"bash -c 'cd ~/temp3; ls; $SHELL'\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of that command above:\n\n*\n\n*gnome-terminal = open up a gnome-terminal\n\n*--tab = open up a unique tab for what comes next\n\n*--title=\"tab 1\" = title this tab \"tab 1\"\n\n*--command=\"bash -c 'cd /etc; ls; $SHELL'\" = run the bash -c 'cd /etc; ls; $SHELL' command, which is a command I just made up as an example; here's what it does:\n\n*bash -c says it is a bash 'c'ommand\n\n*cd /etc = 'c'hange 'd'irectory into the \"/etc\" path\n\n*ls = 'l'i's't contents of this directory\n\n*$SHELL = this cryptic tidbit is required to keep the shell open so you can work with it. If you want the shell to open, run your command, then close, simply remove this part. I, however, want the tab to stay open so I can go make programming magic. :)\n\n*we then start back over at the --tab part to produce tab 2, then again for tab 3. Customize to your heart's content.\n\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: Almost a decade late to the party but, here's my answer using Python.\nIn the .gif below I launched the program from an existing terminal with screen recorder running to show what it would look like at login:\n\nI wrote a python program for this answer.

Does Unity 2d use fewer system resources than Unity 3d? If it requires less in terms of system resources, would switching to Unity 2d increase the battery life of my Laptop?\n\nA: The battery life issue is due to a regression in the linux kernel.  It doesn't have anything to do with unity.\nI'm sure unity 3d's effects have some small negative effect compared to unity2d, but the best thing to do at this point is wait for a kernel version that solves the problem.\nA basic overview of the regression\nAFAIK kernel 3.0 still has this problem, but to a lesser degree.\n\nA: Definitely. Apps that are resource-hungry increase load on the hardware side (processor, bus activities, memory allocation, etcetera) and these lead to increased power consumption. If you want to optimize you battery life, I would suggest these things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a minimal GUI without as many fancy effects. In 11.04 you can select Ubuntu(Classic) during log-on.\n\n*Turn off your wireless adapter and bluetooth adapter. Surprisingly, these adapters can suck out most of your battery life. Only turn them on when you are using them.\n\n*Dim the screen to the lowest level that's practical and comfortable.\n\n*Don't work in such a way that multitasking of processes in necessary, unless you need to do so.\n\n*Turn off sound or use earphones.  Using built-in speakers requires more power.\nTry this out and you will be surprised at how long your laptop battery can last (provided the battery is not dying).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I think this really depends on your hardware, and the way you look at \"less resources\".  If we are just talking about resources such as overall hardware, Memory and CPU utilization, leaving the question of battery aside, then your hardware needs to be considered.\nIf you don't have an external (to CPU) graphics card, then the statement Unity 2D uses less resources makes sense.\nHowever, when you do have a pretty decent external graphics card, why let those resources chill at the side?  Using Compiz (Unity 3D) utilizes resources available to you that otherwise would just sit there and be wasted.  While in one point of view it's using more resources, but on the other hand it moves some burdens to your GPU, so it actually uses less resources on a purely CPU and memory point of view.\nJust look at \nPhoronix's Desktop Manager Analysis\nSame computer running Compiz and Metacity, and they perform about the same.  So why not get the fancy effect?\nin the end, it's how you look at it.  And there's probably no way to know for sure which one is better on your setup until you do a test on it.\n\nA: Actually, I used powertop to measure the number of wakeups, which is an indicator of power usage. Unity 3d, classic with effects, classic without effects are more or less the same as far as wakeups are concerned. Unity 2d seems to be less efficient - may be due to early stage of development. KWORKER, whatever this process is produces the most wakeups and is a process I haven't seen before.\n\nA: You should check out the jupiter power management applet, it had given me a couple extra hours on my battery.\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/02/jupiter-awesome-netbook-powerconfig-applet/\n", "Q: What unique features has Ubuntu brought to the Linux community? Red Hat/Fedora, GNOME, KDE and others have brought things that can be used in the Linux Community, like NetworkManager, Plymouth Boot Splash, a friendlier desktop system, etc. I would like to know what Ubuntu has brought to the Linux Community.\nThings that I know of are Unity Desktop and UTouch (which I find to be an excellent feature). Note that I am not talking about obvious things like look & feel, huge community, etc. I am talking about features that it has added or enhanced in the Linux community.\n\nA: Well, 2 years later and I find this baby: http://www.canonical.com/contributors\nSo some of the great things that Ubuntu has brought to the Linux community or enhanced are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software Center\n\n*Upstart\n\n*Bazaar\n\n*Juju\n\n*Launchpad\n\n*LightDM\n\n*Mir Display Server\n\n*Zeitgeist Library\n\n*DesktopCouchDB\n\n*Apport\n\n\nAnd this are the only ones I have used. The rest are in the list.\n\nA: My personal opinion is that Canonical and Ubuntu biggest contribution to the Linux Community is LaunchPad.net itself.\nThe ease to which developers can rapidly produce testing packages, from a myriad of indicators, to the latest 'cutting-edge' software which can be easily added to Ubuntu and any Debian based distro is simply amazing.  Filing accurate bug reports are so simple - and are often answered by the smaller developers is more than I've encountered on sites such as bugzilla and sourceforge.\nIt wasnt that long ago when you had to get busy with the command line to compile your own software.\nThank-fully those days are now over.\n\nA: I believe these 2 are Ubuntu specific and made a big impact:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Software Center is a utility for installing, removing, and purchasing software in Ubuntu. It replaces several other utilities, which makes the overall experience easier to understand, improves user safety, and frees space on the Ubuntu CD. The next version will be 3.2, allowing ratings and reviews of software. Later versions may include recommendation features, replace Synaptic, APTonCD, and most of the Computer Janitor, and integrate with Update Manager. \n\n\nFrom muktware.com: \"We already agreed that we would like the current Ubuntu Software Center to be improved and used in various distributions.

The issue you had was a broken dependencies (so Google Chrome needed a package it didn't have).\n\nA: One of the comments above has already mentioned this, but I would put this as the answer for your question.\nAll you need to do to install Chromium (read Chrome) in Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\n(it's in the universe repository)\nConsider installing Chromium instead. This is what is maintained by the community. Among their differences is it lacks Google branding, it doesn't have a built-in Flash Player and doesn't have a built-in PDF viewer.

Including ISO images that are bootable like Ubuntu and Windows ISOs. Not only edit but save the edited ISO and can still boot when burned on an USB Drive or CD/DVD.\n\nA: PowerISO just released a free Linux version of their ISO editing software1. Like ISO Master, it retains the state of whether or not the ISO is bootable. However, it allows you to save directly to the original file (by deleting it first), so there is no need to have enough disk space for both files. I also find its interface to be easier and more intuitive to use than ISO Master.\n\n\n1 Unlike their Windows program, the Linux version free to use, without any size limitations or the like.\n\nA: The common answer to this is to unpack the iso file, modify it, and pack it again. It looks like \"ISO Master\", as mentioned in dv3500ea's answer, is a good front-end to do that.\nIf:\n\n\n*\n\n*you don't have enough space for that\n\n*you only want to make a surgical modification instead of rewriting the whole thing\n\n*you want to modify a storage device that contains an isofs filesystem (a.k.a. iso9660) without copying the whole device, or\n\n*if you think this unpacking/repacking thing is just not hacky enough\nThen this answer is for you!\nIn summary, we will replace an existing file in the isofs filesystem with our desired file. Our desired file must be smaller than the existing (target) file, and trailing whitespace (or garbage) must be acceptable. This actually requires only two commands, but be careful: a typo can destroy the target filesystem completely, or even overwrite the source file. Backups are your friend!\nIn my case, I wanted to store a script in a live boot so I don't have to retype it every time. The script is at script.py and my target (a USB stick) is at /dev/sdc. The size of the script is 202 bytes, so our first step is to find a file larger than 202 bytes, so we can overwrite it. After mounting it at /mnt, I found a suitable file at /mnt/info.txt.\nWe can't just overwrite info.txt on the mountpoint, it will complain that it's a read-only filesystem. We are root, though, so let's show 'em what that means! We need to figure out where info.txt is on the filesystem. Find some string that is (probably) unique to info.txt, for example This is the official distribution CD of X., and search for it on the disk:\n$ sudo strings -a -t d /dev/sdc | grep 'CD of X.'\n2573588480 This is the official distribution CD of X. See INSTALL for how to [...]\n\nAlternatively, this can also be done with grep, which is a lot faster, but then you need to specify it from the beginning: $ sudo grep -oba 'This is ...' /dev/sdc.\nNow that we know where it is, we just need to replace those bytes with our file:\n$ sudo dd if=script.py of=/dev/sdc conv=notrunc bs=1 seek=2573588480 count=202\n\nThis line:\n\n\n*\n\n*copies bytes from the input file (if) to the output file (of), and it does not care that the output file is actually a device, because \"everything is a file\".\n\n*conv=notrunc tells it not to truncate the output file, because we only want to overwrite a few bytes, not overwrite the file from a certain point onward.\n\n*bs=1 sets the block size to 1. You usually want a block size of 4k or higher, but this both avoids having to do (inline) math and lets us specify the location exact to the byte.\n\n*seek=N seeks to a certain point in the output file (note that seek=N is different from skip=N because skip skips bytes from the input file!). We set it, of course, to where the target text is.\n\n*count=N copy only this many bytes. I think this can be omitted because it will notice the end of the input file, but I left it in just to be sure.\n\n\nAnd voila, the file is overwritten!\nBut wait, the target file was larger than our script, so on the USB stick, the file is now something like: \"while do if run() blah; blah(); yright 2007 X Inc.\". There is trailing garbage. Two ways to fix this: make our input file longer (add spaces), or add a comment symbol at the end. Note that many editors add a newline at the end, so you might want to set count= to N-1 bytes (if your file is now 203 bytes, and you notice that the last byte is a newline, set count to 202). You can check a file for newlines by using xxd script.py | tail and checking if the last byte is 0a (or, in weird cases, 0d).\nThe process is identical for an .iso file, just mentally replace /dev/sdc with your.iso.\nNote that when you check the target in your mountpoint to see whether it worked, you might need to use strings again (this time searching for your script) since the file is probably still in read cache.\n\nA: Try with xorriso.\nExample from here:\nxorriso -indev INPUT.ISO -outdev OUTPUT.ISO -add FILE_TO_ADD.EXT\n\n\nA: ISO Master \nI have used ISO Master to add files to ISOs before. It is suitable for what you require because it retains the state of whether or not the ISO is bootable. I have used it in the past to add other content (like music) to a live disk. Note, however, that after making changes to an ISO file, you can only \"Save As\", i.e. another ISO file will be created, so make sure you have enough disk space for both.\n\n", "Q: How to remove weather indicator for one user?

However, Mac and Windows won't differentiate file or folder names by case. Therefore, if Dropbox comes across linux directories named \"Sample folder\" and \"sample folder\" (lowercase \"s\"), it will still sync both folders to Mac and Windows computers, but one will appear as a copy of the original file and appended with case conflict.\n\n", "Q: Unable get my wireless network connection under awesome window manager? Unable get my wireless network connection when I switched to awesome window manager. However, automatically I get wireless connection under Ubuntu 11.04 classic.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Thinkpad X300 which is having 64 GB solid state drive. When I used the df command to learn about the free space, I noticed that there is a mount point /var/lock which is having around 2 GB space as shown below. Is it really needed? I would like to use that space also. How to use that? Please let me know.\n$ df -k \nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1             57485580  21128280  33437160  39% /\nnone                   2012364       704   2011660   1% /dev\nnone                   2021604       296   2021308   1% /dev/shm\nnone                   2021604        96   2021508   1% /var/run\nnone                   2021604         0   2021604   0% /var/lock\n\n\nA: /var/lock (and others such as /var/run and /dev/shm) are filesystems that are actually stored in system RAM. There's no need to \"recover\" the space, and it's rather ineffective to use it for yourself. It's used so that system locks and other tasks can run and be used efficiently.\nDon't worry about how much space it claims is available, just look at the Used column for information on how it's actually being used. In your case, none of /var/lock is being used at all, but there's a little bit used for /dev/shm and /var/run. Nothing to worry about, just the system operating normally.\n", "Q: How to get window decorations back?

Or it depends? On what, then?\n\nA: If you installed files using make install, the only way to know where they went later on if you want to uninstall them is to inspect the source files. You may want to archive a copy of the source for this purpose.\nA better alternative is to use checkinstall instead of make install. This allows Ubuntu's package manager to track each of the installed files in the same way it tracks software from the repositories. When using this method of installation, you don't have to keep any extra files around.\n\nA: Generally once you got your binaries installed you can remove the directory containing source code, unless you want to compile them again, possibly with other compilation options.\nSometimes you could find particularly useful to keep the source directory, for example when upgrading Apache.\nYou can decide what's your best, in my opinion keep the source directory is a good thing. Obviously if you don't have disk space issues.\n\nA: You don't need anything except the binaries. Those should already be copied to another location by make install. The rest can be removed. If you're unsure make a backup before removal. Remove, test if still working, if still working remove the backup.\nNote:\n As ændrük pointed out: Using checkinstall  over make install has the virtue of enabling Ubuntu to track the installation. Later you can revert any changes made using the regular Ubuntu package management.\n", "Q: How do I switch the keyboard layout so that the Apple key is CTRL and the ~ works correctly?

Can I upgrade to 11.04 using ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso file without burning on CD  or installing on USB drives. I don't have internet connection, so I cannot download alternate version too. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU UPGRADE DIRECT TO 11.04 FROM 10.04\nDespite the appearances, you should never upgrade to 11.04 without missing out 10.10, even with the desktop or alternate CDs.\nSee this AU answer for more details - \nIn summary, it is not supported, you will likely cause major issues with your install, or even break it so that it will not boot.\nIf you want to use the desktop CD, backup your non-hidden /home folder files and do a fresh install.  After that, copy back your /home folder files.\n\nA: I should point out now that I have no experience with upgrading in this manner, and that the following is what I would do if I were going to do it myself for the first time.\nYou can do this by adding the ISO to APT's list of repositories, documentation for which can be found here.\nFirst you need to mount the ISO so APT can find it. Open a terminal and move into the directory in which the ISO is currently sitting. Let's say it's currently in your Downloads folder, you would type\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nOnce you're there, you need to create a directory into which to mount it. Type\nmkdir upgrade\n\nto create a directory called 'upgrade' in the current directory. Now you can mount the ISO into your upgrade directory by typing\nmount -o loop -t iso9660 ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso ~/Downloads/upgrade\n\nYou may need to precede the above command with sudo - I'm not sure how permissions will work if you try mounting it in a user-owned directory. Now you just need to add this upgrade directory, and with it your upgrade ISO, to APT's sources list.\nsudo apt-cdrom add \nsudo apt-cdrom ident \nsudo apt-cdrom -d \"upgrade\" -r\n\nFrom here, it's just a simple case of running\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand APT will pull the new packages out of the mounted ISO. Once the upgrade is complete, you can delete the upgrade directory as it is no longer needed.\n\nA: Mount the iso file\nNote: You cannot skip versions when upgrading AU-answer \nBut to install ubuntu from ISO file follow this:\nCreat a mount directory called cd-image on your home directory.\nThen\nsudo mount ~/Desktop/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso ~/cd-image -o loop \nAfter that the upgrade dialog should pop up.\n", "Q: What is wrong when the X display does not cover 100% of the framebuffer on a HP2540p laptop Whenever I have a dual monitor setup on my Laptop, one screen is the laptop display and the other the external monitor, I get into trouble with the X server framebuffers.\nOften the larger of the two displays, which is the external monitor, is not fully covered. Even when I disable the laptop display the height of the external display is till limited to the same height as the laptop display.

How can I restrict user from deleting files? \nThe user should have read and write rights, but the delete rights should be denied. In Windows the same task can be done easily, but I don't know the way to do this in Ubuntu. \n\nA: You need an access control list to do this. Package is called acl \nFrom the article:\nAn access control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. For instance, if a file has an ACL that contains (Alice, delete), this would give Alice permission to delete the file.\nThere are 2 packages in Ubuntu to maintain the rules for ACL:\n\n\n*\n\n*sadms  \n\n*eiciel \nThe problem you will run into with chmod is that delete and write are considered the same: if you can write to a file you can empty it (and thus you can delete the contents).\nBtw: the 1st package can also manage your samba settings ;)\n\nA: This can be accomplished by giving user write permission on files only but not on directory. User will not be able to delete a file from directory if he doesnt have 'write' permissions on the directory its self.\nNote that this will also apply on file creation. So without write permission on directory, user will be able to read/write files already existing in the directory but will not be able to create or delete any file.\nUPDATE:\nThe following screenshot shows what I am trying to say:\n\n\nA: set read and write permissions to a group, so all members of that group can read and write.\nmake owner some other user, because the folder is owned by that user \nset this other user's permission of the folder to sticky, only the owner can delete files in the folder\n", "Q: Why do I get an error when I try to postmap sasl password file with postfix?

I've checked to see if the file is used on start up, and indeed if I add some invalid configuration the X server does not start. So the file is read, but it looks like X ignores the settings in it.\nI haven't found anything regarding this online, and I believe that the settings in xorg.conf are correct.\nAny ideas as to why the X server doesn't seem to be picking up the settings from xorg.conf?\nHere is the contents of my xorg.conf file: http://pastebin.com/spt1LDpz\n\nA: It turned out that the screen section in  xorg.conf was overridden by another file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/. \nI removed that file, Now TwinView starts on boot and works as intended.\n", "Q: Case-sensitivity of account usernames When installing Ubuntu, we're restricted to lower-case usernames. But recently I registered for a shell based on Ubuntu and logging in is done by the username registered to sign in to that site. The username starts with upper-case letter, and when logging using SSH, I need the letter in uppercase to log in - it refuses me if I use lowercase.\nWhat's the deal? I want to use uppercase letters on the account of my regular install if possible.\n\nA: The reason why isn't clear - though it appears that some programs don't distinguish between CAPITAL and lowercase usernames. As such there lies a potential for conflict if you have a Marco and a marco account.\nThere currently doesn't appear to be any way to have this done via the users-admin or Ubiquity - likely that these rules are hard-coded instead of pulled from the adduser.conf file.\nYou add the user via the command-line if you force a \"bad username\":\nroot@mine:~# adduser --force-badname Marco\nAllowing use of questionable username.\nAdding user `Marco' ...\nAdding new group `Marco' (1002) ...\nAdding new user `Marco' (1002) with group `Marco' ...\nCreating home directory `/home/Marco' ...\nCopying files from `/etc/skel' ...\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\nChanging the user information for Marco\nEnter the new value, or press ENTER for the default\n        Full Name []: Marco Ceppi\n        Room Number []: \n        Work Phone []: \n        Home Phone []: \n        Other []: \nIs the information correct?

I'm getting serous with a project of my own and need a good documentation on the appindicator module for python. What I've found so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*API documentation on dev.ubuntu.com\n\n*Community wiki entry\n\n*API documentation on the C code\n\n*Nice blog post\nwhat's wrong with them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just a list with no explanations on the arguments, returns and on what the methods do\n\n*Only design considerations and backgrounds - little that would help with actual programming\n\n*Stuff missing the python module has (e.g. create_menu_from_desktop)\n\n*Much useful information compressed but not complete\n\n\nSo basically I need something as detailed as 3. but for the python module.\nExample on my problem:\n\nvoid       build_menu_from_desktop          (desktop_file, desktop_profile)\n\nWhat's are the arguments supposed to be and what does the method do? My guess is, the method creates menu entries from a '*.desktop' file. But if so, why does it need more arguments than just that file? Which entries in the file does it take the menu items from? It's questions like this I'm having a bit of a hard time finding an answer for.\n\nA: Yes, we realize that we need Python documentation with the appropriate level of detail.  That is the goal of the Giraffe project.  It will work with the GObject Introspection bindings which is the way that new Python applications should be written to use the application indicators.\nUntil then, the best bet is the API documentation that you've noted.  It should be roughly the same though \"python-ified\".\nThe build_menu_from_desktop is a convenience function use load the entries that would otherwise be in something like a quicklist in Unity.  So to get those entries you'd use build_menu_from_desktop(\"/my/path/myfile.desktop\", \"Unity\") to specify the TargetEnvironment.  \nThis allows you to have different entries in the desktop file and have some overlap and others not.\n", "Q: Automatic login on Headless, console-only computer I am working with a Gumstix computer running a console-only version of Ubuntu (courtesy of the Linaro project, which is quite fantastic), and when I boot the computer while connected to it over a serial console (ttyUSB) it automatically launches as root.  I think this is a terrible idea.  I'd rather it login as the user I've set up.  How can I set this up?\n\nA: I guess you haven't created a basic user yet :P\nCreate a user for yourself...

Also easiest way to configure Grub2?\n\nA: grub will figure things out for you so no real need to do anything with it if you want each OS to be included in grub. If you want multiple Ubuntu's on the same machine one method could be to just partition your hard disc for the amount of version your are going to install. Ubuntu 8.04 to 11.04 makes 7 operating systems so divide your harddisc up into 7 partitions and a data partition (you can use that to use the same files (audio,video etc). With the 1st one you format this datapartition. With the other 6 you just mount the datapartition.\nIt is time consuming to set this all up and during install you basically can not use your system. And it is not flexible.\nThere is another option that I would prefer:\nDepending on what you want to achieve with this you can also use virtualbox-ose-qt  for every operating system. This would require you to create 1 Ubuntu on the whole disc, install virtualbox and inside virtual box you create space to install the other 6 operating systems. If you do not want to test for speed this could be a more flexible option: adding more or deleting existing systems is possible without needing to reformat your disc or create more space to install it. \nAnd when you are done you can simply remove all the operating systems and still have your base system up and running without the need to add the other partitions to this system.\nHere is an example from kUbuntu with Ubuntu:\n\nIt is slower than normal and you need a bit of RAM in your machine but you can also run all the OS's at the same time if need be ;)\n\nA: You should simply create a separate boot partition ;-).\nThen, when you install a new version of Ubuntu, at the partitioning stage, select to use this new common boot partition for /boot.\nDo this for all versions of Ubuntu that you install, and you should be able to boot into all of them.\n\nA: Do not format home partition while installing,just select a another partition for root(/) file system.Use the same home folder for every version of ubuntu but different root partition \n", "Q: How can I change labels created with build_menu_from_desktop() in pythons appindicator module? Suppose I created an indicator with appindicator for python. Suppose I used the line build_menu_from_desktop(\"/my/path/myfile.desktop\", \"Unity\") for that. How would I go about changing the created menu-items? Their labels for example?\n\nA: This question is partially answered in \nIs there a detailed API documentation on the python binding for appindicator?\nThe answer is: loading the gtk desktop file produces a GtkMenus object somewhere which you should be able to get the gtk menu object out of by looking at it's children.\nI can't find good documentation for what the build_menu_from_desktop returns, if you can't investigate the code manually to find the answer then hunt down Ted Gould who will be able to answer it. Finding the Gtk objects is the answer though.\nOtherwise follow the advice for Ted in the question above, you shouldn't be using the convenience function, instead you should be building the menus manually or loading a glade file if you want the menu entries to be separated into another file. (don't forget to tie methods to their click events in that case)\n", "Q: CATALINA_HOME vs. CATALINA_BASE I can't find a definitive answer to why Ubuntu would set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable, making it different from CATALINA_HOME. I found this document which suggests that not setting CATALINA_BASE would make it equivalent to CATALINA_HOME. That document also suggests that setting CATALINA_BASE would be done to make multiple instances available.\nHowever, I don't seem to be able to find anything that explains this. Presumably, running with a single CATALINA_HOME has been good for a long time, but Ubuntu switched.\nI found this question with an illuminating answer on AskUbuntu but there isn't much specifically on CATALINA_HOME vs. CATALINA_BASE. That question does allude to the \"appBase\" parameter, which is documented in the Tomcat6 documentation for the Host container in the configuration file.\nHere's the questions: Why are these two variables separated? When should they be separated? What does this allow the administrator to do? What do you then place into each directory? When should these two variables be the same? What does ASF recommend for standard practice?\n\nA: CATALINA_HOME vs CATALINA_BASE\nIf you're running multiple instances, then you need both variables, otherwise only CATALINA_HOME.\nIn other words: CATALINA_HOME is required and CATALINA_BASE is optional.\nCATALINA_HOME represents the root of your Tomcat installation.\n\nOptionally, Tomcat may be configured for multiple instances by defining $CATALINA_BASE for each instance. If multiple instances are not configured, $CATALINA_BASE is the same as $CATALINA_HOME.\n\nSee: Apache Tomcat 7 - Introduction\nRunning with separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE is  documented in RUNNING.txt which say:\n\nThe CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE environment variables are used to\n  specify the location of Apache Tomcat and the location of its active\n  configuration, respectively.\nYou cannot configure CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE variables in the\n  setenv script, because they are used to find that file.\n\nFor example:\n\n(4.1) Tomcat can be started by executing one of the following\n  commands:\n  %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\startup.bat         (Windows)\n\n  $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh           (Unix)\n\nor\n  %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\catalina.bat start  (Windows)\n\n  $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh start    (Unix)\n\n\nMultiple Tomcat Instances\n\nIn many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a\n  Tomcat binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same\n  server.  To make this possible, you can set the CATALINA_BASE\n  environment variable to the directory that contains the files for your\n  'personal' Tomcat instance.\nWhen running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the\n  files and directories are split as following:\nIn CATALINA_BASE:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*bin - Only: setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar\n  \n*conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)\n  \n*lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below\n  \n*logs - Log and output files\n  \n*webapps - Automatically loaded web applications\n  \n*work - Temporary working directories for web applications\n  \n*temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files> \n  \n  \n  In CATALINA_HOME:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts\n  \n*lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below\n  \n*endorsed - Libraries that override standard \"Endorsed Standards\". By default it's absent.\n  \n\nHow to check\nThe easiest way to check what's your CATALINA_BASE and CATALINA_HOME is by running startup.sh, for example:\n$ /usr/share/tomcat7/bin/startup.sh\nUsing CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/share/tomcat7\nUsing CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/tomcat7\n\nYou may also check where the Tomcat files are installed, by dpkg tool as below (Debian/Ubuntu):\ndpkg -L tomcat7-common\n\n\nA: Besides being the best way to run two tomcat instances, it makes easier to update.\nI'm using this setup.\n<!-- language: bash -->\n\n/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0-32\n/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.39\n/opt/apache-tomcat-7       (simbolic link to apache-tomcat-7.0.32)\n\nCATALINA_HOME=/opt/apache-tomcat-7\n/srv/user_deploys/tomcat_product_a\n/srv/user_deploys/tomcat_product_b\n\nCATALINA_BASE points to one or another deploy directory.\nBasic binaries and libraries are on /opt/ Just copy server.xml, web.xml (and some other files, read the docs, please) and create directories bin,logs,webapps,temp,work (RTLM, L as lovelly, please)\nYou can update tomcat binaries, by modifying CATALINA_HOME on $CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh file for each instance or you can just modify the symbolic link, updating binaries \"globally\"\nIt's easier to update even if you have just one instance.\n\nA: \nWhy are these two variables separated?\n\ncatalina.home points to the location of the common information.\ncatalina.base points to the directory where all the instance specific information are held.\nSo you have 1 home and can have more than 1 base.\n\nWhen should they be separated? When should these two variables be the same? \n\nIf you have 1 tomcat you can set them to the same value but good practice would suggest you plan ahead and keep them separate: you never know if you need more than one tomcat. \nUbuntu started following this way of thinking due to it being more logical: it makes it easier to run 2+ tomcats but does not disable running 1 tomcat where setting them both to the same value would require everyone to edit the base value. Makes more sense to keep them different.\n\nWhat does this allow the administrator to do?\n\nAllow for more than 1 tomcat to run at the same time where each tomcat instance can have their own apps.\n\nWhat do you then place into each directory?\n\nHome contains the binairy.\nBase contains conf, logs, webapps, work and temp. 1 for every tomcat instance.\n", "Q: How do I get the names in my icon theme for use with pythons appindicator module?

Wrong incomplete answer. For instance \"indicator-messages\" is not included in that list.\nUpdate:\nIn the folder /usr/share/icons/MYTHEME where MYTHEME denotes the name of the theme in use should be the icons. Will test that now.\nUpdate2:\nYes all icons in the aforementioned folder work! And the themes have fallbacks for items not found. The ones in gtk-stock mentioned in the link earlier are from the fallbacks. Would be nice to have some python code that puts out all available icons. One fare good using standard-items of the gtk-stock and the default-theme only, as the others' presence depends on the theme the user employs on runtime.\n\nA: It follows regular icon naming, which will, as far as I know, start at your theme and then keep falling back till it matches something with the name.\nTaking for example the Faenza icon theme I currently use.\nIn /usr/share/icons/Faenza/index.theme it says (clipped)\n[Icon Theme]\nName=Faenza\nInherits=gnome,hicolor\nComment=Icon theme project with tilish style, by Tiheum\nDirectories=actions/16,animations/16,apps/16,categories/16,devices/16,emblems/16,mimetypes/16,places/16,status/16,stock/16,actions/22,animations/22,apps/22,categories/22,devices/22,emblems/22,mimetypes/22,places/22,status/22,stock/22,actions/24,animations/24,apps/24,categories/24,devices/24,emblems/24,mimetypes/24,places/24,status/24,stock/24,actions/32,animations/32,apps/32,categories/32,devices/32,emblems/32,mimetypes/32,places/32,status/32,stock/32,actions/48,animations/48,apps/48,categories/48,devices/48,emblems/48,mimetypes/48,places/48,status/48,stock/48,actions/scalable,apps/scalable,categories/scalable,devices/scalable,emblems/scalable,mimetypes/scalable,places/scalable,status/scalable,stock/scalable\n\nNotice the Inherits=... line? Those are Faenza's \"fallbacks\" in case it doesn't have the icon itself.\nThis is relevant to your question, because you can enter a name for an icon and then the icon will first be searched for in /usr/share/icons/YOURICONTHEME/. In the odd case that it doesn't find it, it will check the fallbacks (in this case /usr/share/icons/gnome/ and /usr/share/icons/hicolor/). You'll find that most (Ubuntu) icon themes inherit from gnome and/or hicolor so if you use the name of an icon in these folders, you can most likely rest assured that every theme will show an icon.\n", "Q: Empathy doesn't obey system/theme/gnome-appearence font settings I actually had this problem since at least 10.04.\nEmpathy ignores gnome-appearance-properties, and settings in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf\nIt's not just a matter of font size, but also it renders Unicode incorrectly due to none configurable font settings that also doesn't obey system settings.\nIs there a work around for this? because the empathy guys haven't even confirmed these bugs yet.\n\nA: The reason why Empathy doesn't have same fonts as the rest of your desktop UI is because in the \"client area\", it uses UI settings as specified by the chat theme (Since version 2.27.3, Empathy uses Adium Message Styles which define how fonts and overall UI should look like for your chat conversations, visit this page for more details), so until something's wrong with the chat theme you're using, it shouldn't look ugly.\nAs far as you've used default chat theme (\"Ubuntu\" in any case since 9.10), there shouldn't be any trouble what you've mentioned as long as the font the theme uses are still installed in the system. But as you've mentioned that you're facing it since 10.04, I wonder if you're using default settings or have customized the system so dramatically that the problem has surfaced in every version of Ubuntu since 10.04.\nAs a quick work-around I recommend you to download chat theme for Empathy called Renkoo (It is the theme from which the Ubuntu chat theme is created, so you'll hardly notice any difference). Once you download it, the theme folder has .AdiumMessageStyle extension, keep the folder in your home directory in .local/share/adium/message-styles/ (if directory doesn't exist, create it). Once you put the folder in there, it should show up in Edit->Preferences->Themes[Tab]. Change the theme and see if fonts now look properly (You'll need to reopen the chat window for changes to take effect).\n", "Q: How do I go \"back\" in Shotwell?

If anyone could provide some assistance in getting an internal, Winbond networking card working with Linux I would be most appreciative. \n\nA: As of Ubuntu Lucid Lynx it seems it should work with ndiswrapper.

There is a caveat with some of the Broadcom wireless cards that many not work well. In this case, the driver will be loaded but not work. And if you try to install ndiswrapper on top of this, there will be a driver mess.\nFor previous versions of Ubuntu, it's OK to use ndiswrapper with the closed-source driver, as it is the only option (no open-source driver possible).\nSo, which version of Ubuntu do you use?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu has an excellent step-by-step wifi trouble shooting guide.Follow it carefully.

I can't figure out how to invoke this application from the shell, but can do so from the gui.\nIf the PC looses power, Ubuntu must wake up, log in, start the application in it's last know state, and connect back to the internet. Since the application is REMOTE, I need the PC to reestablish the wireless connection whenever it drops said connection, and keep trying until it does.  \nI have set the ppp0 as the default connection in network manager.

What i want to acheive it i just want to play a sound file in  ubuntu using the windows speaker. It means the sound should be heard in windows speaker. Possible?\n\nA: The answer is yes. However the windows computer will have to initiate the playback. \nWhat you want to do is set up your linux box as a streaming server. There are multiple packages that accomplish this, Gnump3D is the GNU - free and open source software that will accomplish this.\nThere are various GUI wrappers that help you configure and use gnump3D, in essence though anything that gnump3d plays will be streamed from your computer. Any computer on the local network will be able to play audio files stored on the ubuntu computer.\nEDIT\nAs Takkat pointed out (and I wasn't aware so +1 to him), Gnump3D is not in the repos for recent Ubuntu releases. You can go at it yourself (and if you do please make a post on the ubuntu forums and link in a comment here), or try other equivalent packages (Icecast, mentioned in Takkat's answer works well).\n\nA: By running an Icecast streaming server you are able to stream the audio output from Ubuntu to any client capable of playing internet radio streams.\n", "Q: \"Create Launcher...\" on desktop did not work \"Create Folder\" and \"Create Document\" worked well.

How do I delete one item from the list of 10 \"recent documents\" in LibreOffice Writer?\n\nA: It seems that there should be an easy, built-in way of doing this, but there's not (yet?). LibreOffice is now storing user settings and Recent Documents history in one file. On my system it is:\n$HOME/.libreoffice/3/user/registrymodifications.xcu\n\nIt is an XML document, and extracting the history of just one document is not straight forward.\nThere was a history plug-in (forgot the name) that used to work, but it no longer works for me. I created a script/one-liner to delete the entire recent documents history. It searches for and removes tags of the form: <item ...HistoryInfo> ... </item>\nperl -i -pe 's#<item[^>]+?HistoryInfo.+?</item>##g' $HOME/.libreoffice/3/user/registrymodifications.xcu\n\nThe usual disclaimers apply:\n\n*\n\n*always back up the file first\n\n*understand a script before you execute it\n\n*use at your own risk\n\n\nA: It turns out that the Start Center can do this out of the box.\nYou can see the Start Center when only one of the applications is running and no file is open. You may also launch it by running libreoffice in a terminal instead of one particular application (such as LibreOffice Calc or LibreOffice Writer).\nHovering over the thumbnails presents an \"X\" in the top right corner that can be used to delete the item.\n\nA: This is the one for LibreOffice 4.0x in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\nperl -i -pe 's#<item[^>]+?HistoryInfo.+?</item>##g' $HOME/.config/libreoffice/4/user/registrymodifications.xcu  \n\nIt works for me, but as stated before: use at your own risk.\n", "Q: How to install LibreOffice 3.4 Final In Ubuntu 11.04 or 10.10 How do I install the final version of LibreOffice 3.4 in Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04 and the latest version of 11.10\n\nA: Note Remove the previous version of OpenOffice or LibreOffice with this command\nFor OpenOffice\nsudo apt-get remove openoffice*.*\n\nFor LibreOffice\nsudo apt-get remove libreoffice*.*\n\n1 - Go to; LibreOffice 3.4 Download\n2 - Select Linux x86 deb or x64 deb depending on your computer\n3 - Save & extract the file to ~/Desktop\n4 - Rename the file as libreoffice\n5 - Enter the following command into terminal and wait for the process to finish.\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/libreoffice/DEBS/*.deb\n\n6 - Run the following command to finish the installation:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/libreoffice/DEBS/desktop-integration/libreoffice3.4-debian-menus_3.4-12_all.deb\n\nYou now have Libreoffice 3.4 installed.\n\nA: Here: http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-to-install-libreoffice-34-in-ubuntu.html\nI installed manually as:\n(for 11.04 but i think it would be appropriate for 10.10 or 10.04)\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get purge libreoffice libreoffice-core (purge 3.2 version if you have 11.04)\n\n*download 3.4 debs from here: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/\n\n*unarchive all debs to one folder (fore example ~/debs/libreoffice)\n\n*sudo dpkg -iR ~/debs/libreoffice/*.deb\n\n*libreoffice3.4\n", "Q: Difference between Ubuntu and Linux Mint Just did a live usb of Linux Mint 11 (DVD edition) and couldn't find major differences bar unity in 11.04. Are there any major differences?\n\nA: Well apart from the Unity and that both are very customizable, the most notable differences are:\nMENU\nThe Administration and Preferences menus contain several options not found by default in Ubuntu like:\nMintAssistant – Allows the user to set a root password.\nMintBackup – Backs up the home directory to a single file.\nMintDesktop – Allows the user to select desktop icons, specify the Nautilus mode and determine whether or not to show splash screens for major applications.\nMintNanny – Child protection.\nTHEME\nIt is \"More Green\" than Ubuntu ;) Like more \"hulkier\" Me like Green kind of green.\nPACKAGE MANAGER / UPDATE MANAGER\nIn Ubuntu you have the Software Center we have seen so far when using Ubuntu since 10.10. In Linux Mint they have their Software Center which is similar but includes the option to run .mint files.\nSCHEDULE RELEASE\nIn Ubuntu if they say Ubuntu XX.XX will be release on the 10 of October at 10am with 15 minutes and 20 seconds, you can be sure it will be 30 seconds after what they said but it will still be that day ;)\nLinux Mint does not yet have a so perfect schedule release. They have a \"When Ready Release\" or the famous \"Soon\".\nDRIVERS\nWhile Debian does not have a easy option to install proprietary drivers and Ubuntu gives you the option to install it, Linux Mint installs them automatically, as well as additional proprietary softwares like Flash and others. In Ubuntu 11.04 for example you have the option while installing it to include those drivers (And also the video ones like Nvidia).\nThis is just in the top of my head but there are MANY MANY more like the amount of devs in Ubuntu and the amount in Linux Mint. Where the code is based in Linux Mint (Github for example) and the one in Ubuntu and so on...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: First, if you use the default settings of Mint Update to update your system, certain packages (kernel, firmware, X) will be excluded. Hence even if Mint Update says your system is updated, you may find that running sudo apt-get update followed by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade may yield yet more packages to be updated.\nSecond, while Ubuntu release upgrades are well-tested, Mint encourages its users to do fresh installs. Doing upgrades from within the system is not the prescribed method and is not available via the update manager like in Ubuntu.\nAs can be seen, Mint takes a more conservative approach overall when it comes to updates and release upgrades.\nAs a side note, two differences that have disappeared somewhat with the release of Ubuntu 11.04 and Mint 11 are between the Ubuntu Software Centre and the Mint counterpart. Mint had user reviews and ratings and now Ubuntu does too. Ubuntu showed the amount needed to be downloaded and size when installed and now Mint does too.\nMint 12 uses a layer on top of GNOME 3 called Mint GNOME Shell extensions (MGSE), and Mint 13 comes in 2 editions: MATE and Cinnamon. MATE continues where GNOME 2 left off and introduces its own incremental improvements, while Cinnamon is a development of extra features on top of GNOME 3. All these help increase resemblance to the traditional GNOME 2 desktop.\n", "Q: Internet is often very slow in Natty I recently upgraded from Maverick to Natty on a dual boot with Windows XP. My Internet worked great at first, but more and more frequently I have been experiencing slow connection, not just on the browser, but with any application that connects to the Internet. The connection works fine on Windows, which is what I'm using right now. \nI looked up my problem on Google. Based on my search results, it seems like a common problem. I found something about disabling IPv6. I did so, but the connection did not seem to get any faster. \nI'd greatly appreciate any thoughts on what to do. I've tried a couple of other methods, but was unsatisfied with the results; the connection did not become any faster.\nUPDATE\nI tried the method shown here, hoping this might work for me, but now I can't connect to the Internet at all. The \"Network Connections\" button in \"System Settings\" is also gone, so I can't edit my connections anymore. Did anyone also have the same thing happen? I'm considering re-installing Maverick.\n\nA: To fix your Network Connections problem, I think you need to do this:\ngksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces\nand delete the \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.254\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nsection, which will give control of the connection back to network manager.\nRegarding the original problem:\nWhat happens when you run ping -n 74.125.127.106? Are the times between pings similar to ping google.com or is ping google.com significantly slower between pings even though the times for the ping is the nearly the same as ping -n 74.125.127.106? If there is a difference, then it's most likely a DNS problem. If it is a DNS problem, you could edit your connection in network manager. Go to the IPv4 tab and pick \"Automatic (DHCP) Addresses Only\". Now, add \"4.2.2.2 4.2.2.3\" in the DNS server field and click Save. Reconnect and see if that fixes it.\n", "Q: Audio stopped working in 11.04 Today, maybe after some automatic updates, my audio stopped to work...

Has anyone lost his/her data or OS while installing Ubuntu (not accidentally by clicking \"erase the whole driv\ne\") (and how many peopwle)? I have 110 GB of data and I do not want to back up my data on a hard drive (I do not have one anyway) as it will take too long. I also do not want to spend money to get a dropbox/sugarsync account to back up my data. So my second question is whether it is safe to not back up my data.\n\nA: It is not the installation of Ubuntu that puts your data at risk but the changes on your hard disk partition that may lead to corrupted data if something fails.\nThe major bug when performing hard disk actions still is the human being pressing the wrong button or typing the wrong commands at the wrong time. It is very rare that you loose your data when installing Ubuntu - but it does occur (e.g. in case of a power failure).\nYou may find it time consuming or too expensive or whatever to backup your data but this may only be because you value your data less.\nThe only secure way to make sure your private data persist is performing regular backups - this not only before installing an OS but at least then\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu I personally tend to create 2 partitions, a 20gb '/' partition and the other '/home' and this way my data is always safe on the home partition no matter how many times I install Ubuntu on the root '/' one...\n\nA: I have done one reinstillation of ubuntu without backing up my data.

Hello can someone give me short tutorial how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Windows 7 from my dual boot system (Ubuntu/Windows7)\n\n*Let me use free space as new partition for data (so I don't need to extend Ubuntu itself here)\n\n*Remove windows 7 option from boot screen\n\n\nUpdate:\nThanks to Lekensteyn answer I successfully deleted windows. Now I created new partition (formatted to ext4), but I can not use it. I cannot copy files there, only as root.\nAlso when booting, Ubuntu complains it didn't find /windows partition (of course it didn't, I removed it). I feel like I should update some tables or what, any ideas?\n\nA: These instructions are only valid if you're not using a Wubi installation\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a disk manager (GParted or Gnome Partition Manager will be fine)\n\n*Select the Windows partition (be sure to select the right one!, if you're selecting a partition with the ext* filesystem, you're wrong. A partition with the NTFS filesystem is more likely to be your windows partition)\n\n*Remove the windows partition\n\n*Windows 7 installs its bootloader to a 100MB partition, the first one. If this partition exists, remove it.\n\n*Create a new partition for your data and format it with the ext4 filesystem\n\n*If you're using Gnome Partition Manager, you will be offered to take the ownership of the partition. Otherwise, close the partition manager, mount the partition, open a terminal and run:\nsudo chown \"$USER\": /media/name-of-your-partition\n\n\n*Since the windows partition is missing, GRUB's OS prober won't find it when detecting OSes. To remove the windows boot entry, open a terminal and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis assumes that GRUB is your bootloader which is always the case if you installed Ubuntu after windows 7.\nIf you've previously configured Ubuntu to auto-mount your Windows partition, you need to remove that. Edit the /etc/fstab file as root and remove the line regarding windows. Beware that you do not remove other lines as it may render your system unbootable which can be recovered with a Live CD only! Such a line may look like:\n/dev/sda2 /media/windows fuseblk rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096 0 0\n\n\nA: Just adding to what Lekensteyn said:\nEdit /etc/fstab as follows-\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the line about your old Windows partition.\n\n*Copy the line about your / partition to a new line.\n\n*Edit this new line to have the UUID of your new ext4 partition (type 'sudo blkid' in the terminal to find out the UUID of the new ext4 partition). Also, edit the mount point to something like /media/DATA.\n\n\nAgain, the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*gksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Remove the line about your old Windows partition.\n\n*Add a line similar to this one:\nUUID=uuid  /media/DATA  ext4  errors=remount-ro 0  2\nHere, substitute uuid with the UUID of your ext4 partition. You can find this from 'sudo blkid' or from GParted, Gnome Partition Manager etc.\n4.

Because I wanted to experiment with Ubuntu without loosing my Windows 7 configuration I installed the Wubi Version of Ubuntu inside of Windows 7. Since things seam to work out well with Ubuntu and my harddisk space is very limited, I want to make Ubuntu my only operating system on this machine. So my question is:\nIs it possible, to install Ubuntu 11.04 additionally to my actual configuration (Wubi and Windows 7)? And if things turned out well with the native installation of Ubuntu, too, to delete Wubi and Windows 7 from my system afterwards?\nWhy I am asking this is simply, that I am afraid, that if I just format my machine and made the whole harddisk available for the fresh Ubuntu installation, it could be possible, that it turns out, that one thing or an other would not work properly, like it did in Wubi. (Possible Network, VPN, and Firewall@work issues) In this case I'd like the possibility to switch back.\n\nA: What you ask is possible when you install ubuntu on a seperate partition.  You can also make a seperate partition and move your wubi to that partition  - so you will keep all your installations (look for script for moving wubi to its own partition). I did it even, but afterwards I did a complete installation. 20 GB partition for ubuntu is enough.\nEven better, you can make the partitions before you start.  In wubi: install gparted, and make two partitons extra.  First you have to unallocate space from your C drive (take 20 GB if you can). Then make a D partition of 20 GB in ext4  (not nfts like windows) and a linux swap partition of 2 GB.  Be careful - take a backup before splitting you C partition.  Here is a link with very good explanation:\n https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition\nGood luck.\n\nA: This HOWTO describes how to migrate a Wubi install to partition. The partition(s) must be created already - this is not covered in this guide.\nThe migration supports Wubi installs from 8.04 to 11.04, with Grub2 or grub-legacy. \n\nA: I would use Windows 7's Disk management to shrink the C: partition, rather than gparted. Once you've done that you can use gparted from Wubi to create a new extended partition in that space, with two logical partitions for Ubuntu. Otherwise you have to use a live CD/USB to partition as Gparted won't work on a mounted partition; plus using Windows 7 to partition is safer for Windows.\nThen the migration linked to already will move the Wubi install to the new partitions.\nAfter that you can leave Windows 7 or remove it.\nPS. When you use Windows 7 to partition, make sure you don't allow it to convert to \"dynamic\" partitions. This can happen if you already have 4 primary partitions, but won't be usable by Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Apps run as root appearing like win 98 style after installation of gnome 3 I installed Gnome 3 using Ricotz's PPA.

I've got a laptop with 2 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0 ports and I would like to know how many USB hard drives I could plug into it. Is there a hard limit in the Linux kernel? \nOn the performance side, what is the speed shared across the drives plugged into the port?\n\nA: So, you will find out that with USB3 chipsets, you will actually hit a limit at 30 devices or so, due to a hard 32 device limit (really 96 endpoint limit) on USB3 chipsets.\nI dealt with this problem too and it took me a while to find the real problem and solutions. I wrote a blog post about it.\nBasically, it boils down to these things\n\n*\n\n*There is a 96 endpoint limit with USB3 (which translates to 32 devices only)\n\n*You lose further endpoints due to hubs, using a USB2 cable to a USB3 hub gives you a few slots back\n\n*More generally you should disable USB3 if you can do without it (remove the USB3 kernel driver, or easier if you can, disable USB3 in your bios). Using a USB3 chip in USB2 mode does not help, you have to disable the USB3 so that your motherboard reroutes the port to a USB2 controller that doesn't have that endpoint limit\n\n*if you cannot disable USB3, get a USB2 only PCIe card and that one will truly give you 120 devices or so.\n\nFurther resources:\n\n*\n\n*getting around \"Max number of devices this xHCI host supports is 32\" limit\n\n*Hardware limitations on USB endpoints (XHCI)\n\nA: Theoretically you can have up to 127 devices connected to one host PC but there are practical power and data bandwidth limitations that would prevent that. These 127 devices can be arranged in a tiered network of hubs up to seven levels, counting the PC host as level 1 and the farthest device as level 7. The PC supplies 5 units of power to a hub. Each unit is 100 mA and each port requires a minimum of 1 unit. The hub itself consumes one, leaving 4 units for up to 4 ports. So you will never find a bus-powered hub with more than four ports.\nBus-powered hubs have a further limitation. Since each port has only a single unit of power, they can only connect downstream to a single device. You cannot connect them to another hub for expansion because that hub requires an additional 5 units. And not all devices can run off a single unit. A low-power device like a mouse will work, but a high power device can claim up to 5 units. High power USB devices will only work when plugged directly into a PC host or a self-powered hub that can supply 5 units to the port. \nWhen you connect a device, the PC queries the device for its capabilities and requirements. So, for example, the PC knows that it is connected to a 4-port bus-powered hub which means that each port can only drive one unit. If you try to plug a high power device into that hub, the OS will throw up an error message and refuse to enable the device.\nBus-powered hubs are generally a bad idea because of these limitations and are intended mainly for mobile, not desktop use.\nOn the other hand, if the devices that are plugged into the port are themselves self-powered, then they may not need more then one unit from the hub. For example external disk drives have their own power so should work okay on a bus-powered hub.\nA self-powered hub will be able to supply 5 units to each port, allowing high-power devices and further levels of hubs. So you could plug in one 7-port self-powered hub and then seven more 7-port hubs into that, giving you 49 available ports at just the fourth tier.\nSome self-powered hubs will allow you to use them also in bus-powered mode, but if you try to plug in too many devices, the OS will give you an error message.\nMost hub controller chips have 4 ports so you commonly see 4-port hubs. When they want to build a bigger hub, they just use two 4-port chips. But they have to daisy chain them with the first chip connected to the host and the second connected to one of the downstream ports on the first chip. This leaves only seven ports left for the user, three on the first chip and four on the second -- hence the common 7-port hub.\nUSB is plug-and-play in the sense you don't have to know any of this stuff when you connect things up. The OS keeps track of the power budget of each hub and device, will tell you if the connection will not work, and that you need to use a self-powered port.\nedit: USB packets look like this:\nToken:\nPacket ID: 8 bits\nAddress: 7 bits\nEndpoint: 4 bits\nCRC: 5 bits\n\nStart of frame:\nPacket ID: 8 bits\nFrame Number: 11 bits\nCRC: 5 bits\n\nData Packet:\nPacket ID: 8 bits\nData: 0-1023 bytes\nCRC: 16 bits\n\nHandshake:\nPacket ID: 8 bits\n\nSince the address is only 7 bits, you can only have 128 devices on the entire bus (with 7 bits that can each be on and off, there are only 128 total different combinations of bits possible). This includes your computer, so that leaves 127 other things you can attach to it.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable USB stick to flash a BIOS I want to upgrade the BIOS on an Intel motherboard using a program called iflash2.exe, provided by Intel, which runs only on MS-DOS.\nI do not have Windows operating system, and I am trying to create a bootable USB stick that will contain MS-DOS, iflash2.exe, and related files.\nI tried a program called UNetbootin, which created a bootable USB with FreeDOS, but I do not know how and where to add iflash2.exe and related files.\nCan you tell me how I can do that?\n\nA: I spent all morning struggling to find a way to flash the BIOS on my\nZotac motherboard. Unetbootin creates MS-DOS images that will boot, but\nthey cannot find the flash files (awdflash and N0422_ZA.bin in my case) on my\nUSB thumb drive.\nWhat finally worked was creating an Ultimate Boot CD\nand booting FREEDOS (not MS-DOS) from that CD. Then the USB thumb drive\nwith my flashing files was visible, and the updating of the BIOS worked just fine.\n\nA: I have used the following technique to flash the BIOS on a HP N54L ProLiant MicroServer. I think it should work for other systems too that just need to run a command from MS-DOS after booting from a USB stick.\nI accept no responsibility if this goes wrong. If you don't understand what these instructions do then you probably shouldn't be attempting it.\nThe following assumes that you have a set of files, or an archive file, that contains the new ROM and a script or executable that applies it. The BIOS might have come with an executable to create a USB from scratch; if you've got this far, you've probably tried running that already and failed. What you need to find are the ROM file and script or executable. In my case, the ROM file was called O41072911.ROM and the script was called FLASH.BAT.\nCreate a bootable USB stick\nFirstly, you need a USB stick formatted in the most basic way possible. This will erase all data on your USB stick, so back up anything important first!\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your USB stick.\n\n*Select the Format... option from the launcher menu:\n\n\n*Select Compatible with all systems (FAT) as the type, give it a sensible name, and click Format:\n\nThen you need to use UNetbootin to make the USB stick boot to an DOS prompt:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install UNetbootin either using the Software Centre or from the command line using sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\n\n*Run UNetbootin. Select FreeDOS as the distribution and make sure the type is USB Drive and the correct drive is selected. Then click OK:\n\n\n*When UNetbootin has finished, click Exit.\nNow you have a USB stick that will boot to DOS.\nAdd your BIOS files\nNow you need to put your BIOS files onto the USB stick. As a general principle, you simply need to copy and paste the files onto the volume.\nIf they came in a self-extracting .exe file, you need to run it in order to extract the files. To do this, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Wine either using the Software Centre or from the command line using sudo apt-get install wine.\n\n*Find the .exe file that contains the BIOS files, right click it and run with Wine:\n\n\n*The exact details of what happens next will depend on your BIOS file, but extract the files to a directory somewhere you can remember.\nOnce you have your files extracted, copy them onto the USB stick. They can go in the root directory of the volume.\nTake a look at the files; there is probably a file that contains the new ROM itself, and a .bat or .exe file that is used to apply it. If there's an AUTOEXEC.BAT file, take a look at it and note what command it runs to update the ROM.\nFlash\nNow you're ready to flash your BIOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Eject your USB stick from the computer you created it on.\n\n*Insert it into the computer you want to flash and reboot.\n\n*Boot from the USB stick. You might need to adjust your boot order in the BIOS to achieve this.\n\n*You should see the blue FreeDOS boot loader appear with Default highlighted. Either wait 10 seconds or press Enter.\n\n*At the FreeDOS menu, select the second option FreeDOS Safe Mode (don't load any drivers):\n\n\n\n*You will end up at an A:/> prompt. Type C: then Enter to switch to the C drive.\n\n*Type dir then Enter and you should see all your files that you copied onto the USB stick.\n\n*Run the script or executable that you identified previously as the one to apply the BIOS update.

Congrats to Yorba and his team.  \nI have a small issue with Shotwell 0.9.3.  When selecting specific \"Events\" or \"Tags\" (in the left bar), the photo's appearing in the main window do correspond with the selection but are no longer ordered in accordance with the order selected in \"View\", \"Sort Photos\".  This can be confusing.  \nFor obtaining the visualisation of the photo's in the desired order, I need to change (\"View\", \"Sort Photos\", ...) the order (into an undesired order) and then immediately reselect the original (desired) order.  I suppose that after selecting a \"Tag\", the Shotwell code may have to automatically launch an ordering instance.\n\nA: There's sort of two answers here.\n\n\n*\n\n*There was a bug that was in fixed in\n0.10 regarding ordering not working as expected.

If I type 5 commands, the number changes to 1114 but history -c only resets it to 1110.\n\nA: From bash man page:\n\nOn startup, the history is initialized\n  from the file named by the variable\n  HISTFILE (default ~/.bash_history)...\nWhen an interactive shell exits, the\n  last $HISTSIZE lines are copied from\n  the history list to $HISTFILE.

I have a bat file that I want to be able to call from everywhere, by simply calling it's name. In windows I simply had to add the folder where the .bat file is located, to the windows PATH. I have no idea how to do this in Ubuntu though. I'm guessing there's something similar..\nCan someone explain how to do this.\n\nA: if you want to shortcut the program, and leave it where it is you can either use sym. links or the alias command.\n(note this assumes you've made it executable, chmod +x [script file])\nsym links allow you to create a shortcut that behaves like the file in question.\nsudo ln -s [script start-up file] /usr/bin/[name]\n\ndespite being in /usr/bin it will start in the directory you call it from.\nalias allows you to give an name to a command, or series of piped commans, that you use regually, for example its fairly common to have the update/upgrade commands combined into a single, alias'd, one.\nalias [name]=\"sh /path/to/script/[file name]\"\n\nassuming that your script runs with sh, (this could also be bash, for more complex tasks there is a difference).\n\nA: First of all, there are no bat files for ubuntu, maybe you mean script files.\nIf you create a bin directory under your home, this will be automatically added to your PATH. Remember to give execution permissions to your scripts.\n\nA: I use a folder in my home directory for this: ~/.local/bin\nThat way, it's out of sight and all binary files that aren't system-wide I put in there, like small personal scripts that only I will be interested in running.\nThis method is also helpful for users who do not have system administrator permissions.\nThe PATH environment variable works in much the same way as it does on Windows, except paths are separated using colon (:) instead of semi-colon (;).\nSo, in short, run the following in a terminal (where \"$\" is the prompt):\n$ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin\n$ mv /path/to/executable/file ~/.local/bin/\n\nthen add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file (if you are running Bash as your shell):\nexport PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n\nIf you are running a different shell, this final step may vary for you.\n\nA: Executables should be in /usr/bin so that solves your problem since this is inside your environment.\nYou can set a file to executable with the chmod command (sudo chmod 775 {filename}).\nMore info on the permissions wiki page.\nThe Ubuntu wiki on Environment variables will explain a lot about how settins can be set but there is no need for using this with just 1 script (Linux already got that covered).\n", "Q: MDADM Array help I was running ubuntu 11.04 and my boot drive has become corrupt.  This has stopped me from accessing my raid5 array.\nThe array was set up in MDADM and called MD0 i think. Can I install ubuntu 11.04 on a new os drive and pull back my array? If so what would I need to do?\nAre there any important config files on the old drive?  I think part of the VAR directory is unreadable.\n\nA: I'm a little shaky on doing this, and I can't guarantee that it won't destroy anything. I did go through the same situation and managed to get mine back. I don't remember exactly what I did as it was quite some ago. I think once I had my .conf file restored, I could use 'mdadm --assemble --scan', and it this doesn't work, you can re-assemble the drive (assuming you know the partitions) using something similar to 'mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1' where md0 is your raid partition and sdb1 and sdb2 are the component partitions.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of Alt-F4? I used to close a running application by pressing ALT+F4. But, I realised that the application is still running and the correct way to close (quit) it is the combination of Ctrl+Q keys.\nSo, what is the purpose of ALT+F4 and how is it different from Ctrl+Q?\n\nA: The shortcut Alt-F4 send a close message to the window, as when you press the little x button on the title bar. It is a windows manager configuration.\nIt depends upon the application whether to respond to this event closing all together the application, or iconize (i.e. like xchat can be configured) or other.\nThe Ctrl-Q shortcut you mention is not universal, every application can have its own. For example evince use Ctrl-W, some other use Ctrl-Q to close, Ctrl-W to close a single tab and Shift-Ctrl-W to close all tabs (but not all windows).\n\nA: This entirely depends on the application.\nBy default, applications bind Alt+F4 such that it does the same as closing the window. For some applications that means quitting (like the Calculator), for others it might mean putting them in the background (like Empathy).\nThe job of Ctrl+Q is the developers' free choice, but convention dictates that it quits the application.\nIn short: Alt+F4 will normally do the same thing as clicking . If that only hides the windows, Ctrl+Q will normally quit the application.\n", "Q: Problem with Ubuntu One (syncing) I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed on my computer. The other day I learned about Ubuntu One and signed up for the service. I placed a couple of files into my Ubuntu One folder and they were loaded to the web (which I logged into and saw). I then created a folder, placed a couple of files into it and marked the folder to sychronize with Ubuntu One. This worked as well.\nHowever, as of last night the syncing has stopped working.  I have placed a couple of new files into the folder and I periodically get a small window at the top right of my screen saying that the file x is being uploaded to my personal cloud. The message eventually goes away, but the file is never actually uploaded. So, it did initially seem to work but isn't now. Last night I thought I saw a message on the Ubuntu One website saying that the system was down for maintenance - I can't find that message again today.\nThe only other thing that happened last night was that at one point I received a popup window asking me to supply login information for Amazon S3.

I just wondered if there is any way of changing the letter of this shortcut because it's something that's mildly annoying to me.  I'd rather have Super+t open a terminal like I had in 10.10.\n\nA: I am currently unable to help with rename the shortcut Super+t to trash in the launcher, but I am working on it.  However, I can point you in the direction of where to change the shortcut for the terminal.\nTo change the default shortcut CTRL+ALT+T, you will need to ensure you have the 'Compizconfig Settings Manager' (CCSM) installed.  To install, issue the following command from a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nOnce installed, or if it is already installed, start CCSM.  In CCSM, select 'Gnome Compatibility', and select the 'Commands' tab.

Windows by defaults disables the NIC at Windows shutdown time in order to disable Wake-On-Lan, and this NIC will remain disabled until the next time Windows turns it on. The r8169 driver in the kernel does not know how to turn the NIC on from this disabled state; therefore, the device will not respond, even if the driver loads and reports that the device is up.

In addition, you can perform maintenance on one machine at a time, while leaving the cluster and the services unaffected.\n\n\n*\n\n*run a network time daemon and add it to the time server pool\n\n*run a GPG keyserver and add it to the keyservers pools\n\n*run a Tor bridge or relay, and mirror the Tor Project website\n\n*run a Mixmaster email mix server\n\n*run a Convergence or Perspectives notary to keep track of SSL irregularities\n\n*run a full instance of the SSL Observatory\n\n*run a Tahoe-LAFS node to participate in a secure, distributed filesystem\n\n*run an I2P or GNUnet node\n\n\nThe great thing is that most of these services aren't very processor-intensive, so they run really well even on older hardware. For these sorts of services, it's less important how much total processing-power you can contribute, and more important that there's a diverse set of machines involved.

I see no reason why the kernel would not support two video drivers simultaneously; however i doubt you'll get them to play nice.\nI suspect you'll end up with each screen gaining its own x-server. Essentially this means you'll be running two full desktops off the same computer, i.e. you won't be able to interact between the two monitors.\nInvestigate xinaramma, which is X's (not the more device dependent ati/nvidia) way of handling these situations. Its possible that with this you can unify your desktops.\nIn short, there shouldn't be any issues if you just plug in your card and see (although connecting the hardware might be a challenge depending on the ammount of power/motherboard connectors you have spare,) but I expect you'll have to do some manual configuration to come to the solution you want.\n", "Q: ATI Catalyst Control Center gives error (Radeon HD 6470M) IMPORTANT NOTE: Radeon HD 6xxx cards are not currently supported.

I just started using Ubuntu instead of Windows, my initial reaction was \"omg this is awful\", but after a while it grew on me, and I don't plan on going back to Windows. However I have an Apple Mighty Mouse which I was given today, and the buttons on it don't quite work. \nLeft and right click work, so does scrolling right and down, also the back button works. However the forward button goes back, and the scroll up button sometimes scrolls down, scrolling left just doesn't work.\nIs there a way to fix this? Like remap the buttons? I'm not entirely sure how the driver thing works in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The side buttons are just one physical button, meant to be squeezed from both sides.  It does indeed show up as button 8.\n\nA: If I was in your place, I'd probably buy another mouse (costs something like $10).\nHowever if you insist, you might try to map the keys manually.\nYou can use xev to find the keycodes. Open a terminal, type xev and press enter and a small window will appear. Put the cursor there and do the special keystrokes. You will find the keycodes in the terminal. Then use these codes in the keymapper of your Ubuntu.\nBTW, what Ubuntu do you use?\n\nA: This is a persistent Kernel bug reported since Ubuntu 7:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/319053\nThere seems to be some versions of Kernel that work well with the Apple Mighty Mouse while others do not.\nFor me the Ubuntu 13.04 Kernel: vmlinuz-3.8.0-31-generic supported the Mighty Mouse with proper button functions while;\nUbuntu 13.10 Kernel: vmlinuz-3.11.0-12-generic did not. This bug is still seen in 13.10\n\nA: A couple choices:\nThe package piper is a GUI for working with ratbagd, which allows for more advanced mapping of mouse buttons and functions. Ubuntu 20.04 includes it in the focal, inside universe repository. Debian includes it in Bullseye and later.\nOr, more simply for a device like the Mighty Mouse, use xmodmap. Enter xmodmap -pp to get a current map of the mouse buttons. Button 1 is left click; 2 is middle; 3 is right click; 4 and 5 are up/down scrolling; and so on. Type xmodmap -help or man xmodmap for more info. When you've got your new button mapping figured out, run xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\", but rearrange the numbers to match your new mapping.\nFor example, if your Mighty Mouse has twitchy squeeze buttons and you want to disable them, you might enter xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 8 9\" and remap button 8 (fourth button) function to button 10, which usually doesn't have a default function.

I was hoping to utilize Ubuntu One and in particular, the syncing feature within Ubuntu One to provide offsite backup for some of my files.  My intention was to mark any of my folders that have important files as 'folders to synchronize' to Ubuntu One.  It works great in that whenever an important file is placed in the folder, the file is copied up to Ubuntu One (hence creating a backup).  However, if any of these important files are lost or accidently deleted from my computer then due to the synchronization it is also immediately deleted from Ubuntu One.  This approach does not work very well to provide backup.  On one hand I really like the automatic way in which the synch feature will upload any of my important files to Ubuntu One but on the other hand if I lose the file on my computer it will likely be taken off of the cloud as well (via synchronization).\nWhat approach are others taking to backup their important files to Ubuntu One?  I didn't want to have to manually upload my important files to Ubuntu One and remember to upload other important files as they are created on my computer.\nYour thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Déjà Dup Backup Tool with Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*Start Déjà Dup and go to Edit -> Preferences.\n\n*At Backup location choose Local Folder option.\n\n*Add an Ubuntu One Synced folder.\n\n*Do regular backups with Déjà Dup.\nThis is not a perfect solution because if you delete your Déjà Dup backup files then you loose your backups. However it is still better than just syncing a folder because Déjà Dup makes incremental backups which means that you can always go back to any previously backuped version of the file. Even if you delete the original file, you can restore it as long as you have your Déjà Dup backup files. Déjà Dup has many great features, such as scheduled regular backups, and it supports many locations such as Amazon S3, SSH, FTP, WebDav, etc.\n\nA: That is true, because you are syncing (making a redundant copy), not backing up. There is a fundamental difference that you have found that other people need to realize. Many will protect themselves using this form of 'backup' to protect against catastrophic hard drive failure, but as you have found file corruption/deletion will be considered by the as normal activity and be synced across. \nIf you want to have some sort of backup, I would rather suggest using something like rsync or some backup utility that can do snapshots in time. That way you are able to restore back even if the file you want was deleted or corrupted and that change was synchronized across to the other computer. You could keep the snapshot on Ubuntu One as well in case the hard drive fails.\nUnfortunately this comes at the cost of extra hard drive space used, as does all true forms of backup.\n", "Q: How to kill unity panel & unity launcher? I'd like to find out which process is responsible for Unity panel and launcher.. In case I'd like to close one of them, which process to I have to kill?\nThanks!\n\nA: Both Unity and the Launcher are part of the Unity Compiz plug-in, so to kill Unity , terminate compiz from the System Monitor.\n\nHowever you can't Kill compiz and have the Launcher or Unity running.\n\nA: If you have compiz config manager installed, you can disable unity plugin, witch also results in killing unity.\n\nA: Why not just stop logging into the unity desktop and start using the \"Ubuntu:Classic\" option which gives you the old Ubuntu 10.10 style panel and menu configuration?  Than you can easily remove unity and/or any associated plugins from Synaptic Manager without risking crashing your system due to Unity still running in the background.\nLog Out and choose \"Ubuntu:Classic\" at the bottom of the screen as the desktop you want to login to.\nLogin Manager in System Settings: and choose \"Ubuntu:Classic\" from a drop down menu for your all future logins if that's what you want.\n", "Q: How to setup samba as a domain controller? I would like to setup samba as a domain controller. Can anyone help me with clear installation procedure and steps? Thanks in advance..\n\nA: This is the official document from samba: Chapter 4. Domain Control. It's long and winding but might be a good reference.\nThe Ubuntu wiki will be very useful in setting it up. From the link:\nSamba as a Domain Controller\nAlthough it cannot act as an Active Directory Primary Domain Controller (PDC), a Samba server can be configured to appear as a Windows NT4-style domain controller. A major advantage of this configuration is the ability to centralize user and machine credentials. Samba can also use multiple backends to store the user information.\nIt's for 10.04 but all the commands and settings in the link are still working for 11.04.\n", "Q: Clicking twice on a launcher icon: why different behaviours? The usual behaviour when clicking twice on an icon in the unity launcher is to trigger the scale mode: all windows of that app are tiled. \nNow, a third click triggers different kinds of behaviour: most of the time it does nothing, sometimes it exits scale mode, and sometimes (not easily reproducible) it shuffles windows around, so for instance if I have Evolution open, and I am editing a message, clicking twice will show the message on the right and Evolution on the left, and a third click will shift the message to the left, and Evolution to the right. \nI was wondering what would cause these different behaviours, and is it possible to control them (the second option is most useful, it would be nice for this to be consistent). \nBonus question: is there any purpose to shifting windows around as in the third behaviour, except to impress colleagues?\n\nA: I'm not sure there's an answer to this question. It's an ongoing process to find the best behavior, and you'll find a couple of long discussions about it on the Ayatana mailing list. The way it is in 11.04 is just the way it is, and it definitely has its flaws.\n", "Q: Is MySQL server installed by default? I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 11.04. Since I want to work with a MySQL server on this machine I see, that if I enter mys in the terminal and hit TAB it completes to mysql.

So it raises the question: Is MySQL pre-installed on Ubuntu 11.04 or do I have to install it manually? And if it is already installed, how do I configure/start the server, since the way I know how to start a MySQL server on Ubuntu /etc/init.d/mysql doesn't seem to work?\nI got the feeling that I miss something and I'll be glad if someone could give me a hint.\nThanks!!\n\nA: The package that needs to be installed for the MySQL server is named mysql-server. If /etc/init.d/mysql does not exist, the MySQL server is not installed. After installing it using sudo apt-get install mysql-server, it will be started automatically (after the installation and on startup).\nUbuntu has migrated from traditional initscripts to Upstart.

I have problem with standard gnome3 theme \"Adwaita\". How to fix it?\n\n\nA: Quote from Ubuntu Forums:\n\nProblem with pink borders occurs, when you have too new version of Adwaita installed on your system. In order to have always up to date version of Adwaita, I made symlinks from /usr/share/themes/Adwaita contents (without gtk-2.0 directory) to ~/.themes/Advaivium.\n\nSo, go to /usr/share/themes/Adwaita directory and make symlinks (right click, Make Link) of all content except gtk-2.0 directory and copy all symlinks to /home/yourusername/.themes/Advaivium (yourusername is your username on computer).\n", "Q: How do I export a chart in an image format from LibreOffice Calc?

It explains what some of the more common logs are used for. There is one more log named .xsession-errors in your home dir (and this records your login and has amongst others errors on loading indicators and laucher items), and often grows VERY large, especially if you never log out. \nIn general there is no need to check logs weekly. Security might be an exception but if that's the case your system probably is hosting a server (Apache for instance) and then it is more for seeing irregular access instead of errors. \nI tend to not look at them unless something is really broken. \nSpecifically targeting your questions:\n\nuse this tool to simplify your life\n\nlog file viewer is a good place to start:\n\n\nset up log notification this way and when somethings wired happened, start here\n\nIt is a bit hard to answer this but I always start with dmesg or with the log related to the problem (no need to look in .xsession-errors when you get an error during booting ;) )\n\ncommon command line usages and common uses of grep searching the logs\n\nCommands that are rather useful:\ncat will list the whole file.\ngrep will filter commands. \ntail -f will keep a file active and you will see new notices show up in it when they happen. Rather helpful when tracking down what action you do results in a problem.\n(tail -100 will show the last 100 lines)\nwc -l to count how many times some search happend.\nmore and less show the file too.\nOne example of this:\nHow many times did someone try to login on 'our' apacher server using IP address 111.111.111.111: grep \"GET /login.js\" /var/log/httpd/access.log | grep  111.111.111.111 | wc -l\n\nA: Just after an \"event\" that you need to investigate, do a ls -rlt /var/log to get a reversed, time-ordered (by modification time) list of log files (most recently modified file last) to look at. \n", "Q: How to make sure all internet traffic only goes througth VPN?

I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my MacBook and am trying to get the Apple Remote to work with it. Does anyone have a set of instructions that will help me get it to work. \n\nA: Infrared Remotes are handled by LIRC.\nInstall it via\n sudo aptitude install lirc\n\nA: I have Googled this information for you, and hopefully this should be what you need.\nSetting Up The Apple Remote Control On Ubuntu\n\nA: set up the infrared remote control on a MacBook with Ubuntu.\nIn order to recognize and active the infrared commands and execute the actions for each key, we will use the package LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control). In Ubuntu, it can be installed, along with utilities, from the command as super user:\n# aptitude -y install lirc lirc-x xautomation\n# mkdir /etc/lirc/lirc\n\nAfter the installation, simply create the configuration file to start using the remote control. The configuration file is located in /etc/lirc/lirc/lircrc and contains the mapping of commands to be executed for each action of the control. My file can be downloaded here. Below are shown two blocks of this configuration file.\nbegin\nprog = irexec\nbutton = PLAY\nconfig = xte 'key XF86AudioPlay'\nend\nbegin\nprog = irxevent\nbutton = PLAY\nconfig = Key F5 CurrentWindow\nrepeat = 0\nend\n\nThe first block is activated when the daemon irexec is running, while the second is activated when the irxevent is running. Both represent actions that must be performed when PLAY button is used. Being the first block responsible for simulating the play key on the keyboard, and the second the F5 key.\nIn my case, I always active the irexec for multimedia and and irxevent for presentations. However, the switching of daemon was not a practical task, then I decided to create a GNOME Applet specific to work with LIRC, the ir-switcher (other projects). To install it, just run the commands as super user:\n# wget -O ir_switcher.deb http://ir-switcher.googlecode.com/files/ir_switcher_0.1_all.deb\n# dpkg -i ir_switcher.deb\n# rm ir_switcher.deb\n\nThen you must add it to a notification panel of your environment.\nClicking the right mouse button on the icon you can choose which daemon will run: irexec, irxevent or both. To start the daemon selected, click the left mouse button over the icon and it will change, indicating activation.\n", "Q: Terminal command to show OpenGL version?

If you've got this bug, when you boot from USB, press F6 then edit the boot options:\nAdd these:\nlive-media-path=/casper/\nignore_uuid\n\n\nA: I've had the same problem the entire night. It's due to the installer not recognizing the USB drive after it's booted to BusyBox. \nTo fix this, you need to press F6 and modify the boot options. First, remove \"quiet splash\" from the options and add \"break debug\" in it's place. Continue installation as normal from this point. Eventually, it will break and you'll be presented with the BusyBox shell, and see plenty of the errors relating to this.\nAre you ready for the next step? I promise you, it's an advanced manuver that even Han Solo himself would struggle to attempt.\nStep 1: Unplug your USB drive\nStep 2: Plug your USB drive back in\nStep 3: Type exit and press <Enter>\nStep 4: Wait 5-30 seconds and you'll be booted into your Ubuntu graphical installer.\nNote: I've verified this works for Ubuntu and Linux Mint. I've been working on this problem for about 4 hours tonight and this is what worked for me, after trying every imaginable method of configuration flags for both the installer and BIOS. I am using a Toshiba Satellite C655D and using a 32GB USB 3.0 flash drive as the installation media.\nI hope this helps someone, as I was about to go back to Windows after this nightmare.\n\nA: This may be bug #492301\nTry disabling Floppy in BIOS to find out.\n\nA: Befort the installation it should tell you that there are still some devices mounted. It will ask you to unmount them. Don't tell it to unmount them as it will also try to unmount your USB drive, which is the installation medium.\n\nA: I got the same issue trying to boot Ubuntu 21.04 live CD on my Acer Swift 5 laptop, and none of the proposed solutions seemed to work.\nReading ITAdminNC's answer I realized I was also using a relatively large USB drive (32 GB).\nTrying with a smaller drive (16 GB) did the trick for me.\n\nA: We literally solved the problem by unplugging the USB drive WHILE the installation process was running, and replugging it back in another USB port on the PC.\n\nA: Choosing to install with option Safe Graphics solves this\n\nA: I ran into the same problem today, while trying out the solution of ITAdminNC I spotted an error message that pointed me to my solution.\nIt appears that the USB bus cant power the USB Stick sufficiently for some reason. So I disconnected my USB SSD Harddrive and plugged the USB into a different port.\nThis fixed the issue instantaneously.\n(this is the first contribution from a Linux newbie, so please forgive me any errors here)\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nSolved by moving the usb thumbdrive to a usb port connected directly to the motherboard (back panel) instead of a port on the case and on a hub wich gave me this error.\n\nA: I found that this was an issue with Legacy boot. I was installing pop os 21.04, and I was using CSM mode. The priority was set to legacy first, and since it is technically bootable in legacy, it booted. That seemed to break the installer, so I changed to UEFI first, and it worked just fine.\n\nA: I don't seem to understand what happened in my case, buh literally pressing the f6 button continually did the trick for me\nRunning pop os 21.04 Nvidia installer on a 4gb 2.0 flash drive\n", "Q: What is the advantage to build unity from source Can somebody explain me what is the advantage to build something like unity from source?\n\nA: Usually when you build software from source, it will be for one of several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want to help with the development of the software.  Obviously if you're going to develop the software, you need a copy of the source, and a way to test your changes.\n\n*You absolutely can't tolerate a certain problem with the latest stable version of the software.  In this case, there may be a patch available, so you hope to build from source, with that patch applied.  Or, a fix to the problem may be available in the latest source, but no release has been made since the fix was committed.\n\n*Often times when packagers compile software, some decisions are made at compile time.  If you require different configurations, or wish to optimize for your specific system, compiling the software yourself will allow you to do this.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to ICQ?

I currently did a clean install of Ubuntu LTS 10.04 on my new laptop. After the installation, I attempted to do an update of the system only to find out that the 2 most important interfaces (eth0 and wlan0) I can use to connect to the internet is non-existent.\nI then recalled that when I installed Arch on this same laptop a few months back, I got the same obstacle. Basically, it was because the kernel version doesn't support the 2 interfaces yet. The Atheros card AR8152 (eth0) needs at least kernel version 2.6.37 and the Broadcom Device 4727 (wlan0) also needs a higher kernel version. If I am not mistaken, the install CD I have for 10.04 has kernel version 2.6.32-xx.\nSo I cannot connect to the internet on my laptop. I need to know what the best approach is to update the linux kernel to the current version if I have no internet connection on the laptop.\nI can connect to the internet using a Win7 machine. Also note that I want to use the  10.04 release so upgrading to a newer Ubuntu release isn't an option.\n\nA: You can donwload the package linux-generic or linux-server from http://packages.ubuntu.com, copy it on your traget system and install it via SoftwareCenter or in shell using dpkg -i PACKAGENAME.deb. That should do it for the most part. Unless you need additional\nDependencies\nAs for dependencies: Software Center / dpkg will tell you if any dependencies are not met. Worst case is, you'll have to download them all manually and install them. If we're talking about just one or two packages, I'd do so.\nI have not much experience about auto-installing dependencies. You can try one of the following and see if it works:\nWarning: Stuff gets increasingly riskier further down the list!\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg -i PACKAGENAME.deb then apt-get -f install. The former installs the package no matter what, the latter fixes broken dependencies.\n\n*Try to install it with gdebi \n\n*See if this howto helps\n\n*You could try the daly build kerne-ppa:\napt-add repository ppa:kernel-ppa/ppa\napt-get update\napt-get install PACKAGENAME\n\n\n*Enable natty repositories in synaptic for a short while (do not run update-manager, while enabled).\n\n\nSorry, I can't be of more help.

Seeing as there are many questions regarding Alpha, Beta or Release Candidates for Ubuntu I wanted to know what are the several reasons for a new user (or even an old user) NOT to use this stages from Ubuntu until its finished and the reasons to use them until they are finished.\nThis includes 32-bit, 64-bit, desktop and server.\n\nA: To put it simple: The Alpha, Beta, RC, ... -releases of Ubuntu are very unstable. They're made available for testing purposes. Also, the slightest uncompatible update would be able to kill your system.\n\nA: The reason why people should test Alpha, Beta & Release Candidates of Ubuntu is to bugfix, admittedly not everyone should immediately download the latest version and start doing it on their production machine, but if you are in a position where you have a spare PC or you can use it via virtualbox then you could give it a try and help the release.\nI have done this with versions 10.04 and 11.04, both at the alpha stage and I have found it to be helpful and I gain a better perspective having never done testing before.\n\nA: These versions are not considered stable. So, using them is risky. The probability of getting into trouble is bigger, and this is the reason Not to use them.\nThe reasons to use them are: \n\n\n*\n\n*You start using more recent software earlier. So, in most cases you will enjoy a more modern software ecosystem.  \n\n*You get the possibility of helping the project better, since you are then able to report problems with the Alpha, Beta and RC versions.\n\n\nAs for me, given that I am a programmer and that I am highly dependent of my computer to work, I always use the Stable Release. Though, in my private computer I enable the proposed and backports repositories, so I am able use the most recent (and unstable) software (for which I can report problems too). At my job's workstation I only use the regular repositories.\nWhile I was a student I always used the beta release, and it was once problematic when trying to upgrade it.\nedit: There is a third option: You can also stick to the LTS releases and just update LTS releases. This is the least-maintenance-requiring option.\n\nA: The reason it is not recommended is that the smallest update can kill your machine. Until officialy released as stable any of the versions could crash beyond repair forcing you to a re-install. Heck...it is not even guaranteed a re-install is even an option if there is a problem with the installer.\nAnd not a lot of people can help you when it does: since it is cutting edge software the actual creator of this software is one of few that will understand why it went wrong and is the only one that can fix it.\nSo unless you are able to diagnose the problem yourself and get the solution to the problem or a very detailed description of the problem to the maintainer it is rather useless to begin with an alpha or beta (those are also the reasons to install an alpha or beta: if you want to help getting it better).\nIn general all the Release Candidates up to and including 10.10 have been good for me though. 11.04 I had to wait until the official release to get it working as intended\n\nA: One of the biggest reasons an inexperienced user might not want to use a development release is that it's usually a one-way trip, it is non-trivial to move back to a previous version:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version?\n\nA: Ubuntu has its pre-releases (alpha, beta, release candidate) setup for testing (that means lots of crash reports). I installed Ubuntu in release candidate once or twice back when and I found it to be completely fine, mind you there's no release candidate for Ubuntu 12.04, so I don't know whether Canonical will ever use the RC's again as official pre-releases. As a general guideline, wait until the release if you can. If you just need the latest version of a web browser, office suite, media player, etc. it's much easier just to add the PPA, then do a fresh install on release day of the new version. If you hope to install Ubuntu for a friend, try to plan the install around release dates (tell your friend it's most convenient for you on a date after the release).\nReasons to jump the gun and install a pre-release:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're using new hardware, and you've tried the live session of a pre-release and now that peripheral works out of the box\n\n*You have the patience to troubleshoot dependency issues and possibly live without a few apps properly working, you don't mind the frequent bug report messages\n\n*You're using relatively unstable software anyway (early versions of a desktop shell, etc.) and you've tried the live session and found it to already be much more stable in the future version\n\n*You get to use features that won't be available for Windows for another five years\n\n\nOpportunity cost:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the latest build is still in alpha, features haven't been finalized yet, so expect an insanely unstable system. Don't rely on an alpha build for productivity.\n\n*If it's in beta, use it if you're cool with the points mentioned earlier.\n\n*If you must install Ubuntu for a friend, and you can't postpone it until after the release, if there is no release candidate, get a daily/nightly build if you're just a week or two away from the release date. Almost everything would have been finalized by then.\n\n*If it's for your own computer and you're only a week or so away from release, wait for it to release...You'll benefit from extra features being made available for that version (repositories, scripts, other tips and tricks on popular weblogs) immediately if you install after the release date. If you install prior to the release date, you'll have to put up with doing without those features, or it's going to be much more Do-It-Yourself.\n\n", "Q: Mouse wheel scrolling too fast I have done a clean Natty install having bought a new SSD and find that in applications (ahem) such as Minecraft, and in the default web browser Firefox, the mouse scrolls too far .\nSo for example in Minecraft the mouse wheel jumps multiple items rather than one with each mouse wheel roll.

You'll get a package which has already been compiled, and you can extract it to '/opt/firefox' and make a link to the executable.\nFirefox can be a little funny with its dependencies, however, and you may find yourself needing extra libraries outside of the 7.10 repositories. In short, this could end up becoming quite involved; and I wouldn't attempt it if you're not too sure about the more detailed workings of Ubuntu.\nNote that it will now be up to you to keep your browser updated, as you're outside the reach of aptitude, etc. and with something like a web browser, i recommend you keep an eye out for new versions.\n\nA: From the requirements for Firefox 4:\nFirefox will not run at all without the following libraries or packages:\n\n    GTK+ 2.10 or higher\n    GLib 2.12 or higher\n    Pango 1.14 or higher\n    X.Org 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended)\n    libstdc++ 4.3 or higher\n\nLet's check these dependencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*GTK+ 2.10? Yes gtk+2.0 2.12.0-1ubuntu3\n\n*GLib 2.12? Yes 2.14.1-1ubuntu1.1\n\n*Pango 1.14? Yes 1.18.3-0ubuntu1\n\n*X.org 1.0? Yes 1:7.2-5ubuntu13\n\n*libstdc++ 4.3? Yes libstdc++6, gcc-4.1 4.1.2-16ubuntu2\nI'm surprised that it even works with such an old version. So, technically, you should be able to use Firefox 4.

I'm fine with the newer being default, but also want to keep the older version.\n\nA: If you know your way around the command line, you should be able to compile from source and set the configuration to install in /opt.\nSomething along the lines of ./configure --prefix=/opt.\n\nA: I don't think that there is any way to do this via dpkg or the apt package management system. Thus, your option of resort is to compile from source, making this less of an Ubuntu question, and more of a gcc question. I am sure that\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling gcc from source is a fairly involved process, especially with special requirements such as yours.\n\n*There are plenty of tutorials on the matter.\n\n\nA good lead is to research setting up a \"cross compiler\", which in your case would use the same hardware architecture as your normal gcc.\n", "Q: GIMP Windows Placement when Opened in Unity I have just installed Natty Narwhal replacing my Lucid Lynx system.\nI use GIMP so much, and found that in Unity, when opening GIMP (and actually any applications, I think), the windows placements are kind of less consistent compared to Ubuntu Classic.\nI used to place the Toolbox window in the left side of desktop, the Layers, Channels, Paths, Undo - Brushes, Patterns, Gradients window in the right side, and resize the main window till it filled the gap between the both windows, and the windows will open in that position when I open GIMP.\nHowever, things seem to work differently under Unity. When opening GIMP, the windows are always pushed to the right (looks like it is because of the launcher), even after I set them to fully occupy the desktop (over or alongside the launcher) and close it to 'save the configuration' before reopen it.\nAre there any workarounds or solutions on this?\nI want GIMP to be ready to be used without having to move the three windows to the desired place right after it is opened.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: As a result of this discussion, I was thinking a little about GIMP window placement under Unity.

However, after taking a slightly deeper look, this is what I found:\n\nIn light of the above pic, I am now curious to know how Workspaces are managed under Unity.

Lately I had a problem with this. Although I got connected to my WLAN I couldn't reach any other PC or the internet. With some help of the guys in my local IRC channel we figured out that Intel cards have problems with 802.11n in Linux. So I forced my router to use b/g instead and then it worked.  \nThis may differ from your problem but who knows which kind of problems occur with this buggy Intel driver.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem and solved it using a different connection manager called \"wicd\".

I already organized/tagged them with Musicbrainz Picard. But Picard made an excess of folders and subfolders inside each other because of the tags. \nWhat I need now is a script to read each subfolder and move all the mp3 files inside the subfolder's folders to the main subfolder. For example:\n Music -  \n   Offspring -\n      Album 1 - 20 songs\n      Album 2 - 30 songs\n      Album 3 - 5 Songs\n         Folder 1 - 2 Songs\n         Folder 2 - 3 Songs\n   Journey -\n      Song Pack 1 - 2 Songs\n           Packy 1 - 15 Songs\n           Packy 2 - 20 Songs\n           Packy 3 - 7 Songs\n      Album 2 - 20 songs\n      Whatever 3 - 10 Songs\n\nAfter running the script they would be like this:\nMusic -    \n   Offspring - All Songs inside THIS folder. Not inside subfolders of Offspring.  \n   Journey - All Songs inside THIS folder. Not inside subfolders of Journey.   \n\nAnd so on..\nSo all the music for each subfolder of each music group should not have any more subfolders and all songs inside their respective sub-subfolders should be moved to the main sub-folder of the music group.\nSo when I check Music and I see the Bee Gees then I KNOW that all the songs are right there and not inside some subfolder of Bee Gees.\nNOTE - In some cases there are more than 20 recursive sub-folders. An example is: Music/Lady Gaga/1/Album/Lady Gaga/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/3/3Album 2/Lady Gaga/1/1/1/SONG.mp3.

I tested it, but it comes with no warranty--if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces.\nI did this under the assumption (borne from your description) that you have a main folder subdivided by artist, further subdivided by album.

I do that wireless because i do not always want to plugin the cable to sync some files. Is there a way banshee can recognize my android device over ssh? \nOr do you have any other solution to make that work?\n\nA: Seems like while gnomevfs supports accessing files on ssh servers like local ones the c# bindings banshee is using don't.\nMy guess (it is only a guess right now) would be that if you used fusefs to make the android device appear in /mount like an ordinary device would banshee would see this device. And if this device contained the .is_media_device file identifying it as an MP3 player it would actually use the device.\nLet's give it a try (I have set up password-less authentification with my device using ssh keys, my local username is gunter, my username on my android device is root, and since this device isn't rooted ssh is running there on the non-standard port 2222)\nsudo mkdir /media/Sulla.home\n\nsudo chown gunter:gunter /media/Sulla.home/\n\nsudo chmod a+r /etc/fuse.conf\n\n...add the following line to /etc/fstab:\nsshfs#root@192.168.182.33:/mnt/sdcard /media/Sulla.home fuse user,allow_other,port=2222\n\nA final command at the command-line:\nmount /media/Sulla.home\n\nNow the device looks like an ordinary mounted device. Let's hope banshee will be convinced by this.\nIf this does not work, a possible workaround is to use the FolderSync extension with what we just mounted.\n\nA: There are Android apps to run an ssh server on your phone. You could install such an app, use sftp to connect to it from your computer, or mount your phone's filesystem on your computer with sshfs, and copy files to it that way.\nThere are alternatives that may be easier. I believe you can copy files using Bluetooth. You can install Dropbox on your phone, and link some or all of your music library to your Dropbox folder on the computer side -- the Android Dropbox client doesn't sync automatically, but only downloads when you actively choose to open a file, which is good for this application.\n", "Q: App that enables hotkeys to half-screen a window?

Or will I have to reinstall the operating system, etc?\nI'm thinking of upgrading a core 2 quad to either an i7 or a phenom, which also involve changing motherboards.\nWhat considerations with regards to the installed ubuntu distribution are there? Would it magically recognize the new hardware and just work as is, or will a new installation need to be done?\n\nA: As long as the processor is capable of handling the same arch, and you didn't compile a custom kernel that is missing anything, then yes it should all work perfectly. Just to clarify, if you are running a x86_64 system and the new processor isn't capable of 64-bit then yes it will break. Does not apply for working in the other direction, all 64-bit capable processors can handle x86 kernel and apps. Having said so, if you are downgrading and are running a custom kernel with the processor type set to i686, but the downgraded processor can only handle i386... unbootable system. However you are upgrading so you shouldn't have to worry about that.\nHaving said so, if you are just using a kernel from the repos then you are alright. Ubuntu compiles all of their kernels with compatibility for i386 processors, and with the majority of all distributed kernel modules included. This is to ensure maximum compatibility. In other words, yes it will magically figure it out, lol. Mainly because a basic ubuntu system has compatibility with most hardware on the market, you just only use what the kernel detects at boot or while running. \n\nA: Most new hardware will Just Work with your new motherboard, but there are some things you probably want to do or check before (or after) you change to the new motherboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you had on-board graphics that used a proprietary graphics driver, then remove the driver using the hardware drivers tool.  If you use the same graphics card (not on-board) in both, don't remove the driver of course.\n\n*If you had on-board graphics with an open source driver but manually changed xorg.conf to set a special option, maybe remove that option too (unless you know it will work for the new motherboard's IGP too).\n\n*If you are using an onboard ethernet adapter (which is probably the case), the new adapter will become eth1 instead of eth0.  If you want the on-board ethernet of the new motherboard to be eth0 again, you can run sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules to remove the file that stores adapter->name pairs (this is stored to make sure that the same adapter always gets the same name, which is often important in computers used as servers, gateways, firewalls or routers, but probably not so useful when you switch motherboards).  This file will be rewritten on the next boot, so either do it the last thing before changing the motherboard, or the first thing after changing it.\n\n*If your old motherboard had an on-board RAID adapter (\"fakeraid\") and you were actually using it for RAID, you might need a new motherboard that has a compatible RAID adapter.  If you don't use RAID, or you are using linux software RAID, it doesn't matter.\n\n*If you were booting with a special kernel parameter because of some compatibility issue (e.g. noapic), you probably want to remove it.\n\n\nMaybe other people can add other gotchas they encountered?\n\nA: Problems after upgrading harware may arise mainly from graphic cards or onboard graphics. These may not work the same as they used to and may need a different driver. \nHaving said that it is good advice to remove all proprietary drivers on your system before changing hardware.\nMake sure your backups are up to date\n", "Q: How can I force the Unity launcher to start programs in a window which is not maximised Bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/704187/ means Wine programs can not be run maximised because there is a mouse displacement.

But how do I do the same with MySQL? I see some cron scripts, but that will keep backups forever. I thought the feature of deja-dup that allows backups to be kept up to a month or while there is space. Is there something similar with MySQL?\n\nA: *\n\n*Export your MySQL database to a text file and put it somewhere Deja-Dup picks it up. \n\n\nmysqldump -u {your_DB_username} -p {your_database} > {/home/{user}/textfile.sql} will, after asking for your MySQL user password create a file textfile.sql. Assuming you backup your home directory placing this will back it up.\nBefore backing up you could also compress it to save some space with gzip /home/{user}/textfile.sql\n\nA: I would recommend automysqlbackup .  This is a script run from cron that makes daily, weekly & monthly backups of your MySQL databases using mysqldump.\nOf course that means it has the same disadvantage as mysqldump: it has to lock the database during the \"dump\", but for small databases (when a dump finishes quickly) or when it only happens while nobody wants to use the database (e.g. a desktop that you back up at night) that shouldn't be a problem.  If you use mysqldump manually, you should get an idea of how long it blocks in your case (of course your database will probably grow over time).\nAlso, daily backups are rotated weekly, and weekly backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle (only monthly backups are kept forever) and the SQL dumps are automatically compressed, so in most cases the total diskspace usage isn't too big.\n", "Q: Adding apt-get packages to a usb boot drive (and storing them on the drive)?

If there are libraries that it is looking for, and is not on the usb drive, and hang with me for this one I know it sounds crazy, but I create a replica of the directory structure for the install, and move the libraries into it. IE: /usr/local/{bin,include,lib,sbin,share} Depending on what you set the prefix of the application to be (./configure --prefix=$usbMountPoint/usr/local )or if your past that point, you can do the good old DESTDIR reference. (make install DESTDIR=$usbMountPoint )\n", "Q: Unity is slow and laggy on my PC I love Unity but its performance is slow and it always lags when I multi task. I have 512 MB of RAM.

On a relatively new installation, Thunar has become the default file browser simply by using it. \nWhile I can open Nautilus easily enough, I'd rather it remained as the default file browser(especially when I choose to view files in dual pane).\nHow can I change my default file manager?\n\nA: I have a simple solution.\nRun this command: exo-preferred-applications\nI am using Opensuse 11.4 + Gnome 2.32.1\nThunar became default file browser after playing with XFCE, now I back on Gnome. ;-)\nEdit: This method has been tested on Ubuntu by Park Jun-Hong and found to work.\n\nA: Although convoluted, I believe this link will help you from help.ubuntu.com:\nDefault File Manager\nCheck for the secion titled “Changing Your Default File Manager”\n\nA: I assume this happens in the same way that it can with Dolphin. The fix (at least for 10.10) is to run a few gconf commands to get things back to normal. I suggest you run the following in a terminal:\ngconftool-2 --set --type=string /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/command 'nautilus \"%s\"'\ngconftool-2 --set --type=bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/enabled true\ngconftool-2 --set --type=bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/file/need-terminal false\n\n\nA: Go to \"Preferred Applications.\" I couldn't find this item on the GNOME menu but was able to find it via Gnome-Do just by writing in preferred applications. Once there go to Utilities tab and select Nautilus from there.\nHope this helps someone later on -- I realise this is an old question.\n\nA: Another method to set nautilus as default using GUI :-\n\n*\n\n*Click on the top-left Xubuntu logo, it will display a menu\n\n\n*Select Settings ➞ Settings manager\n\n\n\n*The Settings window will open, Click on the Preferred Applications icon.\n\n\n\n*Then click on the Utilities tab and select nautilus from File Manager section\n\nThat's it. Now nautilus becomes your default File manager.\n\nA: The best way to stop that problem (because it's an issue that even solved can resurface anytime) is to get rid of Thunar if you use Gnome/Unity and not Xfce. \nFrom my experience I can say that Nautilus and Thunar are not tuned up to be used one beside the other, both trying to take over each-other's business, changing the desktop and behaving like they were in their \"normal\" desktop environments (as if Thunar is asking for Xfce and Nautilus for Gnome/Unity). Their parallel use might make sense only for testing purposes. I think most combinations of file browsers are ok, but not that one.\n", "Q: How do I copy an existing hard disc to a new one so I can boot off the new disc? I currently have a failing hard drive which is the only hard drive in the machine. I have just bought a new hard drive to replace it, and my plan is to copy the contents of the old drive onto the new one, and then replace the old drive in the machine with the new one.\nI presumably can't just copy the whole directory structure (or can I)? What do I need to do to manage this, assuming it is possible? Is there a utility to do this for me? (The old drive is hopefully good for a few more hours.)\n(I hope by this means to keep all the software and configuration files as they are, to avoid having to re-install everything. Can that be done?)\n\nA: Yes, a 100% exact copy of your HDD is possible, and it would preserve all your files, data and system configurations intact. And, as you've already correctly guessed, simply copying files over won't work. (it can be done, but not worth the trouble of doing it right)\nA HD cloner tool is your best bet. There are dozens available.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the new hard drive larger than the old one?\n\n*Do you have any Ubuntu bootable CD / USB key?\n\n\nIf so, I recommend the good old dd. Its a one-liner, rudimentary, ancient solution for cloning a HDD. But it works, and its amazingly easy. dd is also pre-installed in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using your Live CD or USB stick\n\n*Using System > Administration > gparted (Disk Utility also works), take note which is your old and which is your new hard drive (sda, sdb, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked? Great!\n\n*Now check them again:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ready?\n\n*Now Triple check it. I mean it! dd will have no mercy if you use the wrong letters. dd is commonly known as \"d isk  d estroyer\" for a reason!\n\n\nFrom now on, Ill assume the old is /dev/sdX and the new is /dev/sdY. Check your actual values! (did I say that already?)\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Terminal, issue the granddaddy of all HDD cloners:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=1M\n\n\n*bs=1M is optional, only to improve performance. The best value depends on your drives/cache/cpu/ram. Commonly used values are 4K, 64K, 1M, 16M. Try for yourself in a 1GB test (add count=256K, 16K, 1K, 64 respectively). For my machine, anything from 4K to 32M leads to very similar results.\n\n*If you want to monitor the copy, you may try this fancy version:\nsudo su - # neccessary to get correct pid\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=1M & pid=$!\nwhile kill -USR1 $pid 2>/dev/null; do sleep 10; done\n\nIt will output dd's progress every 10 seconds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now go grab a lunch. Or better, go to sleep. It will take long ;)\n\n\nPost-copy procedures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the old drive\n\n*Install the new one in the same connector as the old (so you dont need to reconfigure BIOS)\n\n*Boot and check that everything is fine\n\n*Since dd makes an exact copy, partitions will be the same size. If new hdd is much larger than the old one, use gparted to expand partitions to claim the unused space.\n\n\nA: I have used \"clonezilla\" in the past,i had the same problem as you but my system had xp and ubuntu 9.04 on it,it will clone the drive to a new drive just as long if the new drive is bigger or the same size. this is a few vids on youtube on how to use it. its free and saved my butt a few times.\nhttp://clonezilla.org/\n\nA: It might be useful to use the System Rescue CD (which can be run from an USB stick too).  E.g. when you get read errors you'll want to use the included ddrescue.  Note that the applications are not always easy to use (they often only work from the commandline), but they can be very powerful!\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot S-Video + audio jack output not working?

I'm using Ubuntu Maverick (Gnome), a month ago I updated like usual whenever Update Manager informed me of new updates. The thing that happened is that a program called kdewallet  got installed on my machine, and every time I try to do something that requires password like svn, it pops up and starts getting really annoying. How can I get rid of it? It's not even in the Synaptic Package Manager.\n\nA: KDE Wallet is a core part of KDE, it's in the package kdebase-runtime.\nTo disable it run kcmshell4 kwalletconfig and continue at step 3 or start from the beginning:\n\n*\n\n*Start System setings\n\n*Open Account Details\n\n*Go to the \"KDE Wallet\" tab\n\n*Uncheck Enable the KDE Wallet subsystem\n\n*Click Apply to apply the changes and close the settings window.\n\nTo get a list of the programs that depends on the kdebase-runtime package, run:\n apt-cache --no-enhances --no-suggests --no-recommends --installed rdepends kdebase-runtime\n\nOn Ubuntu, the output shows just \"kdebase-runtime [newline] Reverse Depends:\". On Kubuntu, a whole list follows.\n\nA: I use Ubuntu 16.04.LTS and found the 'kdwalletrc' file in this path\n~/.kde/share/config/kdwalletrc\n\nSwitch the option 'Enable' from 'true' to 'false' to disable kdeWallet\n[Wallet]\nClose When Idle=false\nEnabled=false\n\n\nA: I got rid of the \"KDE Wallet System\" dialog (whenever I started Chrome) as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit ~/.config/kwalletrc (see note below), and add\n[Wallet]\nEnabled=false\n\n\n*Kill the kdewallet daemon:\npkill kdewallet5 (or killall kdewallet5)\nI found this option when I looked through the source code (on kde.org or at the Github mirror).\nIf putting kwalletrc in ~/.config does not work, then your system probably uses a different directory for storing configuration files. The config file is created in a directory identified by QStandardPaths::GenericConfigLocation, so I used qtpaths to look up the path (~/.config = /home/rob/.config in my case):\n$ qtpaths --paths GenericConfigLocation\n/home/rob/.config:/etc/xdg\n\nNote: if you don't want to completely disable kwallet, but only for Chrome, you can use the --password-store=basic flag as I explained at Disable kwallet popups from chrome. If you start Chrome via a wrapper script or shortcut, I recommend using --password-store=basic in case you need kwallet for something else. I disabled kwalletd instead of using this flag because I develop Chrome, and it's inconvenient to add this flag all the time when I run ./chrome.\n(Tested on ArchLinux, but it should also work on Ubuntu. Use sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools if you want to use qtpaths to find the configuration directory).\n\nA: I executed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start System settings. \n\n*Go to the Advanced tab.\n\n*Press KDE Wallet icon. \n\n*Uncheck Enable the KDE Wallet subsystem.\n\n\nOS: Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS.\n\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty), step (2) is now \"Go to Account Details\"\n\nA: Disable password required notification Kwallet\nRESUME\nKDE menu => system preferences => notifications => wallet (dropdown) => password required option => show popup (uncheck) => reboot.\nDESCRIPTION\nI'm spanish and maybe the options could have another translation.\nI use KDE Plasma 5.12. Open the KDE menu and search \"system preferences\" and click on it. Now search for \"notifications\". At top right of the window you could see a dropdown, in my case, I had already choosen \"accesibility\" option, then change it and choose \"wallet\". The last step, click on \"password required\" option and uncheck show pop up or something similar (at bottom).

I use Gnome Do as a launcher for most things. I have it set to run on login and for most of the time it sits in the background waiting for me to mash a keyboard shortcut. About once a week, it falls over. I mash my shortcut and nothing happens. I have to re-launch it.\nIt's not amazingly annoying but I would like to know if there are any good ways to make sure desktop applications keep running forever. If they die, they get re-launched (perhaps with a crash timeout so if it crashes on load, it doesn't keep trying to run it over and over and over again).\nI know some applications do this. On Gnome2, if gnome-panel isn't running, the system forces it to load. Is there a simple way of tapping into this logic (of course, without breaking Gnome).\nI don't want this question to be too specific to Gnome Do or even Gnome because I have more than one application for a solution (I run Boxee on an OpenBox desktop on our media centre) and I'm sure other people all have their own issues they'd like to fix through something like this.\n\nA: Another not so elegant solution:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nthreshold=2\nprogram=\"$1\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    start=$(date +%s)\n    \"$program\"\n    ret_val=$?\n    stop=$(date +%s)\n    if [[ ret_val -eq 0 ]]; then\n        # normal exit, quit\n        exit 0\n    else\n        # abnormal exit, check runtime. if < threshold quit\n        runtime=$((stop - start))\n        if [[ runtime -lt $threshold ]]; then\n            echo \"crash on start\"\n            exit 1       \n        fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nThis will restart, if the program (first argument) exits with a return code != 0 and ran at least threshold seconds.\nI tried to create an Upstart job using the respawn and respawn limit options, but that somehow failed.\n\nA: A simple, if not particularly elegant, solution would be to launch the application from a script on loop, such that\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile true\n do\n    gnome-do # or application of choice\n    sleep 10 # prevent super-spawn rates\ndone\n\nAlthough this may have to be checked per application, as bash does not halt for all programs...\nYou could also adapt it to check for errorcodes, so it only respawns if the application crashes, rather than closed.\n", "Q: Forcibly underclocking at night My desktop stays on all the time. It acts as a server and also performs other semi-essential household tasks. During the day it uses the OnDemand CPU setting. This essentially just scales the CPU frequency as it needs it and this works really well for me.\nAt night time, it flits around. Of course most of the time it's idling along at a low power but occasionally, it'll ramp up to do something. I would rather it stayed on PowerSave and tasks were just forced to take a little longer to complete.\nAdditionally, I have a Nvidia card (GTX 580) which can consume about the same amount of power as a small African village uses in a year when it wants to (glares at Minecraft). For unknown reasons (undoubtedly something happening on the desktop), this ramps up, the fans sound like they're charging up to fire lasers into space. At night time, I'd like to underclock the card as far as it'll go.\nI've considered a simple root-run cron script to push these through but my working hours are variable. Last week I had a near-70 hour working week so I was up very early and still up very late, every day. If the system was honking along at super-underclock mode, I would have been furious. Is there something I could do to say, \"Underclock if:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's between 10pm and 9am\n\n*There hasn't been any mouse/keyboard activity for 10 minutes\n\n*There isn't a movie playing\n\n\nIf one of those conditions isn't true, the underclock needs to revert instantly. I don't want to wait for a cron-script to come along to wake the computer up from its slumber. Similarly, as soon as all of those do become true, it should go back to sleep.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: You can force your cpu scaling using:\ncpufreq-selector -f [frequency]\n\nThere are a few more options (i.e. specific cpu, or selecting a governance rather than a speed) This does assume that your motherboard/cpu allows Ubuntu to manually control the scaling (apparently this is not always the case.)\nThe rest can be applied using a script, however you're being quite demanding of it ^_^.  If you need an instant response that I think you have to have something periodically polling your system. From my, some what limited, knowledge there is nothing that announces the conditions you've specified.\nA place to start investigating, however, is a screensaver. This turns on after a set period of inactivity (which would also be true at 10pm-9am) and can be inhibited by movie players. If you made a screensaver that scaled down the CPU when initializing, and restored it on wake, then you'd have what you want.\nUnfortunately that's as far as I can take you, knowing nothing about screensavers and how they work.\nGood luck. \n\nA: You may not actually save more power by using the powersave governor.\nDepending on your workload, finishing a work item quickly by expending a little more power and then returning to a deep sleep state rather than working for extended times with reduced power consumption may give better results.\nDepending on your application, it may also be worthwhile to install a dedicated server with lower power requirements and a properly dimensioned power supply for that load, and simply turn off the desktop at night.\n\nA: powernap is a handy tool for things like this, the nice thing is it looks at your process table to see if your system is busy, not your idle time at the keyboard. \nHave you measured the powersaving for each governor? Like Simon I am skeptic that that would add up to a significant amount vs. getting the work done faster or trying to tune something like the monster video card.\npowernap can be configured to just execute the governor switch or perhaps if your hardware supports it use the Wake On Lan (WOL) feature to take real naps in the middle of the night until it's needed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Blog post from the author.\n\n\nA: Here's a program that does what you want:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# coding: utf8\n\nimport time\nimport sys\nimport commands\n\n\nUSER = commands.getoutput(\"cat /var/log/auth.log | grep \" +\n    sys.argv[0]).split(\"sudo:\")[1].split()[0].strip()\n\n\ndef is_idle():\n    return int(commands.getoutput(\"xprintidle\")) >= 10 * 60 * 1000\n\ndef is_night():\n    return time.localtime().tm_hour in (22, 23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n\ndef is_stumm():\n    return \"RUNNING\" not in commands.getoutput((\"sudo -u %s pacmd \" +\n        \"list-sinks | grep RUNNING\") % USER)\n\n\ndef main():\n    powersave = False\n    while 1:\n        if is_idle() and is_night() and is_stumm():\n            if not powersave:\n                print \"going into powersave mode\"\n                commands.getoutput(\"echo powersave > \" +\n                    \"/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\")\n                powersave = True\n        else:\n            if powersave:\n                print \"going into ondemand mode\"\n                commands.getoutput(\"echo ondemand > \" +\n                    \"/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor\")\n                powersave = False\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    assert commands.getstatusoutput(\"xprintidle\")[0] == 0, (\n        \"you need to `sudo apt-get install xprintidle`\")\n    assert commands.getoutput(\"whoami\") == \"root\", (\n        \"you need to be root to run this program\")\n    main()\n\nNote your preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*... >= 10 * 60 * 1000\n\n*... tm_hour in (22, 23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\nand\n\n*\"RUNNING\" not in ...\nI'm using pulseaudio to find out if a movie is playing.

You can probably fix it by following the instructions from the bottom of the Banshee FAQ page. Run the following in terminal:\ncd ~/.config/banshee-1\nsqlite3 banshee.db \".dump\" > dump\nmv banshee.db banshee.db.backup\ncat dump | sqlite3 banshee.db\n\nUsually this kind of database corruption happens as a result of a Banshee crash, or a system crash or power loss while Banshee is running.\nWhy is this so common with Banshee?\nThis type of error is more common in Banshee than other applications that use SQLite databases because of the way Banshee's database is set up.  By setting PRAGMA synchronous to OFF, Banshee's SQLite database has increased performance, but unfortunately Banshee runs a higher risk of database corruption (but not data loss) as a result.  Once Bug 621057 is fixed, users won't even notice this error anymore because Banshee will automatically recover from it.\n", "Q: Add NTFS partition to live USB If I add an NTFS partition to my USB, will it be accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu?\n\nA: Only the first partition on a USB stick will be accessible by Windows, and it must be either FAT or NTFS.\nIf you want to create a Linux Live USB stick with an NTFS \"shared\" partition, do the following (using gparted):\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all partitions from it\n\n*Create the shared NTFS partition (must be the first in the drive)\n\n*Create the 700MB~1GB FAT partition (for the Live Session)\n\n*Make it bootable (right-click the partition > Manage Flags > boot)\n\n*Use the Startup Disk Creator to create an install in the second partition\n\n\nThis way you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the stick to boot the PC and either use a Live Session or Install Ubuntu\n\n*The Live partition will be invisible and un-accesible from Windows\n\n*The NTFS partition will be visible and accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu\n\n\nA: Yes it will.

Why is that? \nAlso, its named like\n/media/7013bc1d-b3a2-4df6-8c85-828ced85ef0e\n\nHow can I get something more meaningful?\n\nA: It depends on which method you use to mount your internal volume.\nRemark: The cryptic numbers are the UUID of your volume. Every partition in the world has its own unique UUID to identify it. Using it as mount-point basically a makeshift. Developers are talking about a better algorithm to find more appropriate, human-readable mount-points involving the disk-label, size, vendor etc. We'll see, what the future brings.\nMounting is done by shell\nIf you're mounting partitions in a shell and you do not want to enter your password each time, you can configure sudo to run the mount and umount (for unmounting) commands without a password. This will introduce a security risk as a special crafted command can grant the user root privileges.\nIf you want to sacrifice security for ease of use and enable this rule, you need to edit your sudoers file. Do not edit /etc/sudoers directly, but run sudo visudo. Replace yourUser by your usernameL\nyourUser ALL=(yourUser) NOPASSWD:/bin/mount,/bin/umount  # insecure!\n\nTo avoid having to type sudo, put the next line in the ~/.bashrc file:\nalias mount='sudo mount'\n\nAs for the naming: Simply use another mountpoint. That can be any empty folder of your choice you have write permissions to. man mount in shell will tell you how to do that.\nMounting is done by nautilus (in gnome)\nIn case you are having nautilus (ubuntu's default file manager - similar to windows explorer) auto-mount the system, it's a bit trickier. You need to add the volume to your fstab. As in the shell based method you can specify a mount point there as well to get rid of the cryptic numbers. It goes like in my answer to automounting a ntfs volume with the exception, that you need to replace 'ntfs' by the actual filesystem of your volume.\nSo you basically just have to add a line similar to tat one to the fstab:\nUUID=7258CB9858CB598D /media/win ntfs rw,auto,users,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=46,uid=1000    0   2\n\nThe users option is important to be able to mount and unmount the volume without a password query. Also gid and uid should be set right for that purpose. Note the \"Don't reboot with errors\" part in my link.\n\nA: FS outside of your home directory does not take effect from your normal user privileges until you perform on the behalf of super user by giving password. it is only possible if you use sudo prefix.\n\nA: I can give you a easy solution.\nFirst why did it ask for password? because your account is not root and for security reason (and also to keep your information secure and prevent loss of data) ubuntu does not auto mount other drives excluding root drive (file-system /)\nIf you want to auto mount all the drives then just install ntfs-config application\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\ncheck all drives for mount and write permissions.\nif your are in ubuntu 11.04 then just create '/etc/hal/fdi/policy'  directory first then run this application.\n", "Q: What's the best TCP congestion avoidance algorithm to an ADSL2+ connection?

Reading posts, forums, and issue tracker complaints, I gather than this is because decision-makers of some kind decreed that desktop icons are an antipattern and they would prefer not to support them at all.\nBut, there's a fork of their desktop-icons extension called \"Desktop Icons NG (DING)\" that solves the drag-and-drop, but development seems to be slow, s.t. newer version of it are not compatible with newer versions of Gnome Shell (what?), so their v18 addition of the arrangement feature is not available in the v17 that gets installed on my Ubuntu. (Why anyone would develop against the upstream version of Gnome, that gets used by approximately 1% of of the 1% of the world computer population who use Linux; is beyond me.)\nSO! tl;dr, I installed a fork of DING \"desktop-icons-neo\", and it has all the features you'd expect Ubuntu to have out of the box.

This is the example: I want to install elementary-desktop (from PPA), but it requires to remove esound in order to install pulseaudio (which I removed because it was causing problems with many apps). I already pinned both esound and pulseaudio and held them through sudo aptitude hold esound and sudo aptitude hold pulseaudio but, in Synaptic, the prompt still states that esound must be removed. Thanks in advance for your help!\n\nA: Elementary I believe only recommends pulseaudio. What you could do is install via the command line using sudo apt-get install --no-recommends elementary-desktop, or use Synaptic and simply unmark esound/pulseaudio when elementary-desktop is selected for installation.\nIf it is not a recommendation, then you could simply install the packages you want (that the metapackage depends on), giving you at least the majority of the Elementary experience, minus pulseaudio.\n", "Q: How do I disable my system from going to sleep? I am getting a web server setup at home on an older AMD 2400+ desktop. I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed and running however, after a time, I can no longer browse to the server. When I go to the keyboard and press a key, everything magically works again. \nI have looked through the BIOS and I am not seeing any power saving features enabled. Is there anything like that in Ubuntu? Can it be disabled?\nI don't have any GUI installed. This is console only.\n\nA: In addition to the systemctl mask/unmask options, I also use the following to turn suspend on/off for the Gnome desktop.\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'suspend'\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'suspend'\n\nor\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'nothing'\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type 'nothing'\n\nI found these by exploring the settings revealed by the commands listed in How to dump ALL dconf/gsettings so that I can compare them between two different machines?\n\nA: Please try looking into these links - cyberciti.biz and Arch forums\nThis is an excerpt from the cyberciti.biz link:\n\nBy default, the Linux kernel will use\n  screen-save option to disable it you\n  need to type this command (it\n  turns off monitor VESA powersaving\n  features):\n$ setterm -powersave off -blank 0\n\nIf it dumps back you with an error that read as follows: cannot (un)set\n  powersave mode\nYou need to shutdown X window system\n  and rerun the above command.

This\n           will link these unit files to /dev/null, making it impossible to\n           start them. This is a stronger version of disable, since it\n           prohibits all kinds of activation of the unit, including\n           enablement and manual activation. Use this option with care. This\n           honors the --runtime option to only mask temporarily until the\n           next reboot of the system. The --now option may be used to ensure\n           that the units are also stopped.

I can ALT+TAB them but that is about it. Where do I visually see them or at least a small icon that tells me where they are and how many windows of that type are opened (Like 4 windows of Firefox I have).\n\nA: They should be in the launcher, which you can reveal by moving your mouse to the top-left corner or by pressing and holding the Super (Windows) key:\n\nNote, that you can scroll down by moving the cursor to the bottom edge or use the mouse wheel.\nIf you don't like that behavior, you can install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (package compizconfig-settings-manager) and change the hide mode of the launcher (see this question: How can I configure Unity's launcher auto-hide behavior?).\nThe focused application will show an arrow on the right side of its icon, while the left side arrows show how many windows are opened: one arrow for one window, two arrows for two windows, and three arrows for more than two windows.\n\nA: Some apps appear as a separate icon in the launcher on the left. Some icons (usually those pinned to the launcher) can just be clicked on. In this example, I have the main browser window and the downloads window minimized.

I have two monitors attached to my Ubuntu desktop system.  One is mounted above the second one (i.e. one up, one down). Unity draws the system panel across the top of each monitor - so the bottom monitor's panel is actually across the centre of my total display, with the other monitor above it.\nThe problem is that I can't drag a window from the top monitor to the bottom - it goes most of the way across, but I can't slide the the title-bar down across the central panel.\nStrangely, it works fine dragging from bottom to top monitor - the title-bar crosses the panel with no problems.\nI have a partial workaround by enabling Put in Compiz and setting mouse and keyboard shortcuts to switch windows to the other monitor, but it makes the system non-intuitive.\nThe ideal solution would be to move the lower monitor's panel to the bottom of the screen, but I don't think Unity works this way.\n\nA: Hold your move-window modifier (it is alt by default) and drag the window from within the window's chrome (body) as opposed to the title bar (using your mouse).\n", "Q: English grammar checkers for gedit or LibreOffice Writer? Please let me know if there are any efficient English grammar checkers available for gedit or LibreOffice on Ubuntu 11.04. \n\nA: LanguageTool: An Open Source style and grammar checker for English, French, German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, and other languages. You can think of LanguageTool as a software to detect errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell checking.\nLanguageTool will only find errors for which a rule is defined in its XML configuration files. Rules for more complicated errors can be written in Java.\nLanguageTool requires an external link to Java 5.0 or later. The current version only works with OpenOffice.org 3.0.1 or later and LibreOffice and you need to restart OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice after installation of this extension.\nInstallation and Usage\nIn OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice: Double click LanguageTool-1.3.1.oxt to install it. If that doesn't work, call Tools -> Extension Manager -> Add... to install it. Close OpenOffice.org and re-start it. Type some text with an error (e.g. \"This is an test.\" – make sure the text language is set to English) and you should see a blue underline.\nAlso see Usage for using LanguageTool outside of OpenOffice.org.\n\nA: The LibreOffice grammar checker Lightproof is already packaged in the repositories, and is easy to install. Install the package libreoffice-lightproof-en (or -hu for Hungarian or -ru-ru for Russian), and restart Libreoffice if it’s running.\nNote that the available grammar checks are more limited than in MS Office, so if it seems to not be working, that might be the reason.

I am unable to copy and paste these in Ubuntu, but may search and replace in gedit each character individually (replacing for what I think is it's best match), obviously this is only feasible if there are only a few types of square.\n\nI'm lead to believe that these squares are displayed because I am missing certain fonts... My aim is to convert this into an ePub or PDF file.\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*What type of coding is this? And why does this happen?\n\n*If it is missing fonts, can I install them and will this solve the problem (allow me to convert symbols to PDF e.g. using Calibre)?\n\n*Is there an application to convert my text file to a text file without these squares, instead replacing them with a similar character? For example, the symbol  is pretty much a y, so I would like this function to replace each instance of  with a y.\n\n\nAn example txt file is here and it originally looked like this (note inaccuracies followed OCR).\nNote: I couldn't get either uni2ascii or iconv to work (though I may not have been using the correct [options]), so please check with the given file before posting a solution!\n\nA: The boxes mean \"glyph not found\"; the characters in the box are hexidecimal representations of the codepoint, in unicode. \nThere are two possibilities: the character encoding is garbled, or the font you are using doesn't have a glyph for that character. This is a great overview character encoding if you really want to understand it: http://trochee.net/2011/05/character-encoding-tutorial/\nCuriously, U+001F and U+001D are really just glorified line breaks. It seems odd that OCR would return those. \n\nA: The squares (as far as I can tell) always occur in places where special typesetting characters have been used. For example, typesetting ty as the letter t followed by the letter y in some fonts leaves extra, unwanted space between the two letters. For that reason, many fonts used for more advanced typesetting have extra characters for this, like the ty character that should read \"...ancient beauty a temperate...\". Since you don't have these extra characters (it's possible you can't even decode them, since they might not have an ascii/utf-8 code) you get squares.\nI have no real idea on how to copy the actual text (and in this case get a t and a y as separate characters), but the people at TeX, LaTeX and friends might be able to help - they're not necessarily font experts, but they're all into typesetting...\n\nA: That's not any encoding I recognize. My guess is that the missing symbols do not represent written characters, but rather indicate extra information about the OCR process.\nUsing a flexible interpretation of ASCII control codes, 0C might represent a page break and 0B could be a tab or other whitespace. 1D and 1F are supposed to be \"delimiters to mark fields of data structures\", but at a glance 1F could conceivably have been co-opted to mean unidentified:\n$ hexdump -C -s 0xa0 myfile.txt | grep -C 1 \" 1f \"\n00000250  6c 64 20 6f 66 20 61 6e  63 69 65 6e 74 20 62 65  |ld of ancient be|\n00000260  61 75 1f 20 61 20 74 65  6d 70 65 72 61 74 65 2c  |au. a temperate,|\n00000270  20 68 75 6d 69 64 20 72  65 67 69 6f 6e 20 77 68  | humid region wh|\n00000280  6f 73 65 20 0a 6d 69 73  1f 20 75 6e 64 75 6c 61  |ose .mis. undula|\n00000290  74 69 6e 67 20 68 69 6c  6c 73 20 68 61 64 20 62  |ting hills had b|\n--\n00000350  20 33 30 30 20 0a 73 70  65 63 69 65 73 20 6f 66  | 300 .species of|\n00000360  20 74 72 65 65 73 20 67  72 65 1f 20 69 6e 63 6c  | trees gre. incl|\n00000370  75 64 69 6e 67 20 6d 61  70 6c 65 73 2c 20 63 61  |uding maples, ca|\n--\n000006a0  65 20 61 62 6f 75 74 20  31 30 20 6b 69 6c 6f 6d  |e about 10 kilom|\n000006b0  65 74 72 65 73 20 61 77  61 1f 20 62 65 79 6f 6e  |etres awa. beyon|\n000006c0  64 20 61 20 70 61 73 73  20 0a 63 61 6c 6c 65 64  |d a pass .called|\n\nIn this sample, the byte 1F is being used degenerately in place of ty,, w,, and y,.\nAnother possibility is that the file was damaged during some past encoding conversion.

In your case start by running:\nsudo mkdir -v /media/cdrom0 ; sudo mkdir -v /media/cdrom1\n\nThis will create the future mount points for your cdrom drives. Then run this command which will edit in the proper lines in your fstab file:\n echo \"# cdrom 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab  \n echo \"/dev/sr0 /media/cdrom/  auto ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab  \n echo \"# cdrom 1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab \n echo \"/dev/sr0 /media/cdrom/ auto ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n\nThen you will want to remount the file systems listed in fstab with this command:\nsudo mount -a\n\nPop in a cd or dvd to see it this corrected the issue. If it did solve the issue there is some problem with automount. This is only a workaround for a bigger problem.\n\nA: Is it one specific DVD or all DVDs?\nIf it's all DVDs: You should also check the regionset in terminal type, sudo apt-get install regionset\n and then sudo regionset. And make sure the region code of the drive matches your region code. (This happened to me a couple of times randomly...)\nIf it's one specific DVD: Have you remembered to install libdvdread4 (if it's an encrypted DVD)?\n\nA: I had this problem, though the difference is that I got an error message that said :\nmount point /media/cdrom/ does not exist\n\nSo instead of directly applying what dginsd says, you might want to try making a directory according to what error message you get, if you do get one. Since mine showed the above, this is what I put in the command line and it solved the problem for me:\nsudo mkdir -v /media/cdrom\n\nAnd you're done. This did it for me. Make sure to do it according to your error message.\n\nA: I know this post is almost 10 years old now, however I found a solution for those here by Google. This solution does not use the terminal, just the \"Drives\" and \"Files\" applications. First open \"Disks\", then find your DVD or CD drive, then note the \"Device\" data (the /dev location) in my case it's \"/dev/sr0\". Now, if you open the file manager, then go the \"+ Other Locations\" tab, then open your computer root directory (\"Computer\"). You can go to the \"dev\" folder, open it, then find your drive file, again, in my case \"sr0\", right click, then \"Open With Other Application\", then \"View All Applications\", then find \"Disk Image Mounter\", click select. Now your drive should be mounted. I know this is not a long-term effective solution and that you can't write to the disk, however, it should work if you just need to read (at least on 20.04 LTS).\n\nA: According to this post -- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1950008\nUbuntu 11.10 can not read the drive is set to 'Slave'.

There's no particular configuration involved beyond installing the packages themselves. You could skip tasksel and just install the packages you intend to use, or you could use tasksel and then purge mysql, or you could just keep mysql, which shouldn't interfere with your existing database installation.\n", "Q: Illustrator alternative I have just migrated to Ubuntu a few months ago, and find myself wanting Illustrator again. What is the best alternative for vector based drawing? Can Gimp do vector as well, or is it mainly pixel based like Photoshop?\n\nA: Inkscape is a very, very good choice for that. It is built for vector graphics, which in many cases is exactly what you want.\nFor pixel graphics (photos, etc..) the GIMP is nicely powerful and fully-featured.\nFor Desktop publishing and Layouts, I like using scribusNG\n\nA: XaraExtreme http://www.xaraxtreme.org/\n\nA: You can try Inkscape .\nsudo apt install inkscape\n\n\nIt is built for vector graphics. If you need an animation tool, you can use Synfig-studio .\nsudo apt install synfig\n\nGIMP can do vector graphics, but it is designed for (and should be used for) raster.\n\nA: There is also a helpful guide on using Inkscape for Illustrator users.\n\nA: OpenOffice.org Draw is another alternative.\n\nA: Inkscape is a good alternative, and if you want more complicated vector graphic, you could try Torapp guilloche designer, it is free and runs in Chrome 20 and above. No installation and plugin is needed.\n", "Q: Error updating Cardapio During my last run of the update manager, I got an error about a broken package.

It is of course:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install cardapio*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/*cardap*.deb\n\n*It should install all related packages from there and ignore the attempt to overwrite.\n\n\nIf this does not work, note the offending file, and delete it:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /path/to/file/be/careful/with/it\nAnd then run the command to install the package that gives you the error:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i --force-all /var/cache/apt/archives/nameofpackage.deb\nNB: In this case, you have to be specific, since the wild card I used in the first method would cause the offending package to just try to write the same file again.\nIf it still refuses to install, then you could manually extract the .deb files to perform the update, until of course cardapio's ppa gets updated :).\n\nP.S.

However this change isn't actually reflected on the screen. The brightness remains unchanged from what I left it at when I was logged into Windows. This problem has only manifested itself after I update to Natty, the brightness adjustment worked perfectly in 10.10 for me.\nIt seems I have the same issue as in this: Changing brightness on a Sony Vaio laptop question, however on a Toshiba Portege R705-P35.

If I publish several U1 files, delete some, add some, update their file content - will the public URLs of every file stay the same in the end, or do they change depending on the order files are published in and etc?\n\nA: It depends.\nOnce you've published a file, if you unpublish it and then re-publish it, it will get the same URL the second time as you did the first.\nYou can move it within a Ubuntu One \"volume\" (that is, the Ubuntu One folder or any other cloud-synced folders), and it will retain its public URL. You can modify the file and that, also, will keep the URL. However, if you edit it with an editor that renames the file, creates a new one, copies the content in and then deletes the original (as most editors do), and syncdaemon is running, it will see the rename and the delete and your public URL will refer first to the renamed file, and then will disappear.\nThis is an unfortunate side-effect of the way we're doing public files, and something we need to change, but right now this is what it is.\n", "Q: Using the Apple Wireless Keyboard I borrowed my flatmate's Apple Wireless Keyboard and I want to connect it to my Dell running Ubuntu 11.04 (Unity UI).\nI tried various solutions, but I can't even get it to work like a numpad.\nCould somebody please write down or at least point to the steps needed to make it run properly?\n\nA: The Apple Wireless Keyboard (AWK) works with BlueTooth, and you need to make Linux able to talk with it this way. I got one with a cheap adapter from RadioShack. First thing is that you must make sure that Linux recognizes the adapter itself. If it is an internal one, search and check for its chipset.\nAs I was using BlueTooth for the first time on a computer, I found that under Linux, any device that is attached by BT must have a name.

It has all the features of other software suggested in this thread, but fares much better at detecting movie titles and finding quality subtitles.\nYou might need to run several passes on a given folder to find all subtitles, recursively.\nIt also detects embedded subs (mkv..), skips files which already have subs in your language of choice, and automatically renames the subs files to match video file names.\nAlso, I made a gist and an action, for the Nemo File Manager (can be converted to use Nautilus), that adds a context menu option to automatically download English movie subtitles.\n\nIt's available here on GitHub\n\nA: Before mentioning a few tools beside the ones mentioned in the other answers, I want to clarify  why there is a difference between the different tools.\nI have noticed that the most up-voted tools under this question that I also wanted to use failed in finding any subtitles for certain videos, while VLC/VLSub, for example, was finding a lot o subtitles for the same videos at the same moment. - After testing a bit more (with videos of various origin, period, celebrity, country and extension) I have found that the cause is rather simple:  \nSome tools (namely SubDownloader, SMPlayer (default setting - see update below), Subliminal) search based on hash which is theoretically error free, while VLSub and OpenSubtitlesDownload.py can also search by name - with possible error but much more findings, of which at least one is the good one 90% of the time. - VLC/VLSub has also a separate option to search only by hash. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC can do it with the addon VLSub: it comes integrated in the player after version 2.2; sometimes the integrated version may be outdated I think and you have to use the latest version of the addon from HERE or HERE, where it is actively updated, by putting the lua file in ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/ .  See this answer on how to install.\nIt can be accessed under 'View':\n\n\nVLSub can find and save subtitles in the video folder by instantly renaming the subtitle to match the video name. That can be configured.\nThe only downside is that you have to start the player and run VLsub from there, as lua files cannot be run from command line, but even that brings the advantage that while the video is open you can quickly test the subtitles. The window of the VLSub tool with the list of found subtitles stays open and you can easily select a new one to download and load if the previous was not good. (That is a big advantage when you search only by name, and not by hash, and face the risk of getting first the wrong subtitles.)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenSubtitlesDownload.py\n\"It can be used as a nautilus script, or as a regular application working under GNOME or KDE desktop environments.\" \nFor Nautilus:\ngit clone https://github.com/emericg/OpenSubtitlesDownload.git\nmkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/\ncp OpenSubtitlesDownload/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py\nchmod u+x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py\n\n\n\nBut the OpenSubtitlesDownload.py script can be used in other File managers  (Thunar custom actions, Nemo actions, Pantheon-Files contract files) by adding the command\nsh -c \"/path/to/OpenSubtitlesDownload.py %f\"\n\nA downside that I've noticed is that (while it is said to search by both hash and name) in the list it shows it's not clear which subtitle is to be preferred; after selecting a subtitle the zenity window closes; after selecting a bad subtitle, and in order to select a new one, one must run the script again; also, it seems to be less effective in finding subtitles for series than for feature movies. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*FileBot\n\"tool for organizing and renaming your movies, tv shows or anime, and music well as downloading subtitles and artwork.\"\n\nOr search by typing the name\n\nDownloading subtitles is only one of its options, and it is mainly centered on renaming. It needs Java to work (and the GUI version seems to specifically ask for Oracle Java to work as intended). \nThe GUI interface is especially useful to download subtitles for multiple videos (e.g. for series, which none of the above can do), and then the program can be used to match the names of videos and subtitles with the 'Rename' tool. It searches both by name and hash.\n\n\n*\n\n*FileBot command-line version is my favorite.\n\n\nThe general command is filebot -get-subtitles /path/to/video/.\nTo search also by name (beside hash) the -non-strict option should be used.\nTo download English subtitles no language option is needed, but for other languages there is the option --lang with the 2 or 3 letter language code, but only one language can be specified per command, so you have to use separate commands for each language.\nTo rename the media files (using TMDb) and match their names, a useful option is -rename.\nThe command can be added to context menu in Thunar's custom actions (or Nautilus actions, etc) by running it in a terminal; for French it should be:\ngnome-terminal -e \"filebot -get-subtitles  --lang fr -rename -non-strict %F\"\n\n\n\nI especially like about it the ability to download subtitles for multiple videos at once when the %F argument is used (tested in Thunar).\nAlso, for already existing videos and/or subtitles, it can get the proper names by using the -rename  argument and by omitting the -get-subtitles one; example of a Thunar custom action in Xfce for English titles:\nxfce4-terminal -e \"filebot -rename -non-strict %F\" -H\n\nThe downside of the CLI version is that when it gets the bad subtitles (which rarely happens, even if hash-checked subs are not available, only ones searched by name, but it may happen) there seems to be no way to list and select new subtitles as in other tools.\n\nUPDATE on SMPlayer:\nIt searches by hash by default, but that can be changed in Subtitles-Find subtitles at...-Options.\n\n\nA: You can use subdownloader  or to install in shell sudo apt-get install subdownloader which is very good to download subtitles for any type of movie/series.\nAfter downloading/installing it the program should be in the Sound & Video section in the applications panel. If you are using Unity by default just press SUPER and type subdownloader and press enter.  \nWhen you open the program it will automatically log in to opensubtitles and just search for the movie you want to find the subtitles for or the folder where the video or videos that you want to search the subtitles for. Then select the language for them and download. It will automatically put it in the folder where the video is, renaming it to the video name and enjoy. Open the video with VLC and you should be able to watch the movie with the subtitles.\n\nA: You can also try to install smplayer which provides subtitle downloading natively.  \n\nYou can go to 'Subtitles' --> 'Find subtitles on OpenSubtitles.org'\n\nand get a list of all the available sub files.\n\nThe files are downloaded and saved instantly along with your movie file ;-)\n\nA: Features of Subdownloader are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No spyware, no adware\n\n*Fast hashing algorithm (27 GB movies/7 seconds)\n\n*Recursive folder search\n\n*Autodetect language of the subtitles\n\n*Upload entire series subtitles in less than 1 minute\n\n*Many more…\n\n\nSubDownloader : Ubuntu subtitle Downloader\n\nA: There is a other alternative to download with terminal.\nhttp://subliminal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n~$ subliminal -l pt -- movie_name.avi\n", "Q: What about Internet problem in Ubuntu 11.04? I have a problem in Ubuntu 11.04 that Internet cannot work when i run my PC , i have dsl in my computer and when Internet cannot run i pull Cable and put it again these problem every time when i run pc , and many users Complain from this problem . what is the solution?\n\nA: It is very difficult to be helpful when you provide so very little information. You should always try to provide as much as you can. \nBut you say that many users complain about this and since it is very uncommon for people to have problems with cabled network in Ubuntu, it is possible that your internet service provider uses something called PPPoE. In that case, you would normally have to enter a username and password in order to connect to the service.\nIn that case, click the network icon in your upper panel and select \"Edit connections\". You'll get a new dialog and the right-most tab is called DSL. Click Add and another dialog will appear. In the DSL page of that page, you can enter username, service and password. Your internet service provider can give you that information. You can choose a name for the connection and decide if it should be connected automatically. \nI think that should be it. If it doesn't work, but you do need a username and password, then that is the right place to enter all the details, but you'll need to get some support from your internet service provider. \nPlease confirm if it does work. \n\nA: Have you tried in terminal running sudo dhclient just in case or in the Unity gui clicking AGAIN on the connection made (Tipically auto eth0, eth1, etc...)\n\nA: You can actually look into trying to renew ip command:\n$ sudo dhclient -r\n\n-r flag explicitly releases the current lease, then..\n$ sudo dhclient \n\nObtains fresh/new IP\nHope it may help you\n", "Q: Where I can download video codecs? I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm having difficulty watching videos.  How can I install the video codecs needed for most video formats? \n\nA: Besides, though on Windows platform software called VLC ( VideoLAN Player ) is \"codec-less\", in Ubuntu world it also removes you from many small glitches inside gnome offered pre-installed players like Rhythmbox and Totem. I might be mistaking, but some of them rely on GStreamer problems.\nConsider downloading and using it also, especially if you prefer DVDs and torrents...\nI think upstream version was in ubuntu-univerese repozitory, that should be enabled by default in freshly installed Ubuntu OS, so you only have to open Terminal and write this:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nBest wishes.\n\nA: Normally when you install Ubuntu in the installer it asks you to install 3rd party stuff which includes this codecs for video/audio.\nClick here: ubuntu-restricted-extras \nIt will ask for some additional dependencies, just say yes.

I'd consider updating Ubuntu or rolling Pidgin and Docky back to the stock install.

I just had a hard lock-up crash not even a Alt + Shift + SysRq + R + S + E + I + U + B could solve. I've now rebooted and would like to report the bug with the saved logs.\nWhat's the best way to report it?\n\nA: If something you did triggered the freeze use Apport and trigger the freeze again. Apport will detect it automatically and you should be able to file a bug-report.\nThis is an excerpt from Debugging System Crashes\n\n\n*\n\n*If your system crashes at random\nintervals, perform a MemoryTest first\nbefore filing any bug reports or\nsupport requests\n\n*If your system crashes when a\nparticular action occurs, and this is\nrepeatable every time, try the\nfollowing steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to reproduce the crash on a text\nconsole (Control+Alt+F1) if\npossible. If the crash occurs during\nstartup, select the recovery mode\noption to disable the splash screen\n\n*When the crash occurs, press\nAlt+SysRq+1 (one, not L) followed by\nAlt+SysRq+t. If using a text\nconsole, you should see a trace\ndumped to the screen. If the system\nis sufficiently alive, it will also\nbe logged to /var/log/kern.log and\nvisible in the output from dmesg.\nThis information shows where the\ncrash occurred, and should be\nincluded in any problem reports. If\nthe output is not saved in any file,\nor the system is so bad off that you\ncannot retrieve it, you can either\ntake a digital photo, or hand write\nthe results. Almost all of the\noutput is important (so please don't\ncopy the one line you think is\nimportant, because context means\neverything).\n\n\n\nA: It's not even certain that there is any data to report. If there was, it would probably be in the old dmesg logs in /var/log. But since the kernel might not sync the filesystems if it crashes, the data could be lost.

Before everything worked fine, but when booting today the following happened:\n\n*\n\n*Window focus does not leave the first-opened program. This means that if I keep Firefox open, and open a terminal, window focus will never be transferred to the terminal.\n(EDIT: if I open a terminal first, and then open Firefox, Firefox steals focus)\n\n\n*Window menus have disappeared. The maximize, minimize, etc., buttons and menu are gone.\n\n\n*In Xfce Settings Manager, the \"Window Manager\" settings window is empty.

Here is a new link (also from 2011) containing a good write-up: How are Linux drives named beyond drive 26?.\nTo summarize the main point in the link (slightly revised and reformatted):\nDrive # - Name\n1       - sda\n26      - sdz\n27      - sdaa\n28      - sdab\n52      - sdaz\n53      - sdba\n54      - sdbb\n702     - sdzz\n703     - sdaaa\n704     - sdaab\n18278   - sdzzz\n\nNeedless to say Linux is well positioned for expansion of drives.\n\nA: Yes. The kernel will continue to assign names in the form of sdaa, sdab and so on. There may be a bug preventing it from going beyond sdzzz, but in theory, it's going to continue forever (that is up to 18278 due to data type limitations).\nmy thanks to Rinzwind for providing the links\n", "Q: USB stick not avaliable after rebooting from Live session Ive noticed a really annoying behaviour in Ubuntu: whenever I restart or shutdown the PC from a Live session, the USB stick becomes unavaliable when it reboots/turns on (as if the \"safe removal\" feature from windows was used)\nIve noticed this in 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, and even Linux Mint 10 and 11. Also happens with all USB sticks Ive tried (like 4 different models), in all machines (tested in like 5). So I think this is rather a feature than a bug/hardware issue.\nBut its really annoying. After playing in a Live Session, i must physically unplug-and-replug the USB stick so it works again. \nIs there any way to disable this behaviour? So I can reboot my PC and use the Live Session again without unplugging and replugging the USB stick?\n\nA: For those who might be interested, I've found the culprit: When you shutdown a live session, Ubuntu ejects its media. for an USB stick, this means powering down the USB port.\nA workaround is to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and change the line:\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash --\n\nto add the parameter noeject (noprompt is also useful, so it does not ask for ENTER to eject CD when shutting down)\nLike this:\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash noeject noprompt --\n\nPresto :D\n", "Q: Ubuntu on 256MB RAM \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to configure ubuntu for lightweight low-memory usage?\nHow can I reduce Ubuntu install size to the minimum, with GUI?\n\nI was wondering if I can use Ubuntu (scale down version?) or a close derivative like xubuntu or kubuntu on an old machine? Its a P4 with 256MB RAM.\nWhat distro would you suggest?\nForgot to mention that its only used for basic document and internet work.\n\nA: I would recommend Lubuntu on that machine. Lubuntu uses the lightweight LXDE desktop environment. According to the official release notes the minimum memory requirement for running Lubuntu 11.04 is 128 MB of memory. To use the graphical installer from the Live CD, you need at least 256 MB of memory.\nOfficial Lubuntu website: http://lubuntu.net/\nRelease Notes for Lubuntu 11.04: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReleaseNotes/NattyNarwhal\n\nA: You can give Lubuntu, a Ubuntu-based-LXDE desktop a go. \nIt's designed to be very very lightweight, so it'd work better on your computer than say KDE/Kubuntu, or most other Ubuntu derivatives.\nAccording to the Lubuntu wiki: \n\nA Pentium II or Celeron system with\n  128 MiB of RAM is probably a\n  bottom-line configuration that may\n  yield slow yet usable system with\n  Lubuntu. It should be possible to\n  install and run Lubuntu with less\n  memory, but the result will likely not\n  be suitable for practical use.\n\n\nA: I'd recommend a dedicated lightweight Linux distribution like Puppy Linux.

After installing Gnome 3 the Compiz plugins are not working on the gnome-shell. \nIs there a way to enable the Compiz on Gnome3 shell??\n\nA: GNOME Shell uses its own compoziting window manager called Mutter. According to Owen Taylor's mail it is not possible to use an alternative window manager.\n\nTo try and make GNOME Shell integrate\n  with multiple window managers would\n  either greatly constrain the user\n  interface vision or greatly increase\n  the amount of work involved.

I set it up for WebDAV with no problems. It wasn't until I tried to host multiple projects that I ran into trouble. \nAt first, I had all of the project folders in one repository. But then I saw the error in my ways and switched to multiple repositories.

Your repository is possibly located at a location like /some/dir/repos with /some being svn not being able to access /some because svn does not own /some and:\n\n\n*\n\n*svn is in the group of /some, but the permissions are set like 700\n\n*svn is not in the group of /some and the permissions are set like 750\n\n\nIn both cases, svn cannot descend in /some because the execute-bit is missing on /some.\nTwo solutions are possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the other execute bit to /some so the permissions look like 751\n\n*add the group execute bit to /some and make sure the user svn is a member of the group\n\n\nYou need to check all directories above your repo.

So I've changed and uncommented one line in /etc/default/grub to this:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1440x900\nThen to change purple background of grub I created the image, in my case just black image with 1440X900 resolution and put it in /boot/grub.

Examples: special network share or flash drive,so I can easily identify them.\nUbuntu 11.04 Gnome Classic.  \nUPDATE: By \"special network share\" i mean network shares which are \"permanently\" mounted using the fstab e.g. in my case samba shares on my home server. I have one for music and one for other stuff.\nIt would be totally fine for me if the icon is on the share or drive and some (hidden) auto-loaded configuration file knows where it is.\n\nA: There is a little trick that I learned from cleaning Windows viruses off people's flash drives that might just work for you.\nIf you create an autorun inf file with an icon linked inside, it will use that custom icon for the drive. Now, the one thing I can't help with (immediately) is the syntax (but I will update my answer later with an example).\nI also am not sure if it will work on networks, but it will definitely work for removable media.\n\nEdit (by George Edison): you can do this by creating a file named 'autorun.inf' in the root directory of the medium with the following contents:\n[autorun]\nicon=autorun.ico\n\n...where 'autorun.ico' is the filename of an icon file relative to the 'autorun.inf' file.\n\nA: I think you can just right click the icon, go to Properties> When properties window comes up, click on the icon in that window> Navigate to the new icon you want to use, choose it and click Open. That will now be the icon for that device.\nEven for removable flash drives/external drives.\nAs long as you keep the icon in the same place (i just use my home folder)..\nIt will always appear for that device when it's mounted. \nHope that helps. \n\nA: I have used the \"autorun.inf\" route on my windows machines but for some reason it does not work with Ubuntu 14.10.  Also, if you actually name the chosen icon \"autorun.ico\" it lets you readily identify that it is in use by autorun so you do not delete it.\nOn superuser a similar question was answered with:\n\nAnother way to accomplish this is to use desktop.ini. (Actually, on USB drives, \n  I use both autorun.inf and desktop.ini). This technique has the virtue that it \n  also works for individual folders. Simply create your desktop.ini file with\n  contents similar to:\n[.ShellClassInfo]\nInfoTip=Some descriptive text here\nIconFile=.\\icons\\DriveUSB.ico\nIconIndex=0\n\nWhere I have a folder called \"icons\" which contains an assortment of icon \n  files. I can then customize this (and autorun.inf if needed) as the need arises\n  to display an appropriate icon. Also, when you mouse over the folder icon, your\n  descriptive text will be displayed.\nYou'll also want to set the \"system\" and \"hidden\" attributes on the file \n  (desktop.ini) to make sure that Windows gives it the special treatment that it \n  deserves. You can do this in the GUI or with the command:\nattrib +s +h +r desktop.ini\n\nFor more information on desktop.ini, see this MSDN article.\n\n", "Q: How can I specify the graph scale in the System Load Indicator?

Most likely you will get short/difficult or cookie cutter answers because that's all the time someone else could spare. It's not that you're doing anything wrong  - it's that what you are trying to do is only easy for experts. Hopefully someone with more time will help you piece things together...\nAs a technical user I really would like to help but it is clear that this is going to take up quite a bit of time but perhaps I'm just slow :-) My advice to you is set a time limit - say \"I'm going to spend 45 minutes on this problem in total\" and if you find yourself taking even a minute more than that please stop! I hate it when I see new Linux users chew up hours of their life on nasty issues :( Good luck!\n\nA: try this\nit is written for ethernet eduroam but it might work with wireless too. You should change few things (dont have time right now to tell you what) but you will be able to see that on your own. if You cant post it here! \n\nA: The best source is probably your system's very own online reference. From a terminal, type:\nman wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nUse Page Up and Page Down to navigate it, and press q to quit.\n\nA: It is not necessary to uninstall network manager. If you ever look at a Fedora setup and do\n    ps axww | grep [w]pa_supplicant \nyou will see that wpa supplicant makes use of a configuration file because it is launched with a command line option setting one. Since it is launched via dbus the file you will need to edit\n    /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/fi.epitest.hostap.WPASupplicant.service\nand add a -c option to the config file. As mentioned in an earlier comment you will need to add fast_reauth=0 to the .conf file. For the change to be picked up you will need to relaunch wpa_supplicant (the \"easiest\" thing to do is reboot) then run the ps command to see that the option has been picked up. Note that for me fast_reauth=0 did not fix my problems on eduroam...\n", "Q: How can I add a custom compose key sequence? How can I add a custom compose key sequence?\nFor example, I would like Compose, |, > to type the ▸ symbol.\nI have tried adding the following to ~/.XCompose:\n# Import default rules from the system Compose file\ninclude \"%L\"\n\n# Custom definitions\n<Multi_key> <bar> <greater> : \"▸\" U25B8 # Black right-pointing small triangle\n\nbut the new sequence is not usable anywhere except for xterm.\nInstalling ibus-table-compose and then enabling the Compose input method in IBus did not solve the problem; IBus imitated many compose key sequences, but not the one I had created.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a file named .XCompose in your home directory (~/.XCompose), which contains:\n# import the default Compose file for your locale\ninclude \"%L\"\n\n<Multi_key> <bar> <greater>  : \"▸\"\n\nSee man 5 Compose for more info about the format of this file.\n\n*Add the following to ~/.profile:\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=\"xim\"\n\nOn Ubuntu 18.04 (maybe others), you may need to use the following instead:\nexport GTK_IM_MODULE=\"gtk-im-context-simple\"\n\n\n*Log off and back on.

I'd like to avoid snapshotting unnecessary files, so I always run apt-get clean beforehand.\nWhat else might I be interested in cleaning up before taking the snapshot?\n\nA: Not sure what cruft there should be on a fresh installation apart from  the apt cache. I'd rather concentrate on uninstalling unneeded packages.

I've just installed Ubuntu and I need either video, wireless, or some sort of other manufacturer (non-opensource) driver. How can I run the tool that will fetch all of these for me? I'd like graphical instructions.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I install extra drivers via the command prompt?\n\nA: Drivers\nUnlike Windows, most hardware is natively supported in Ubuntu and does not require separate drivers to work.  Generally speaking, if it works don't worry about a driver not being installed. Please note: there is a bug so that your graphics card will be displayed as Unknown in System Settings even if the driver is correctly installed and working--you can safely ignore this (or see this Q&A for the workaround).\nIf however something isn't working:\nUbuntu uses a graphical user interface called jockey or \"Additional Drivers\" to manage and install hardware drivers that are not natively supported by Ubuntu.\nTo open it hit Alt+F2 and type jockey-gtk.\nA window will then open that will allow you to select additional drivers for sound, video, wireless etc.  Here's a screenshot of this window, I already have several drivers enabled.\n\nIf something still doesn't work and you don't see a relevant driver in Jockey, please post a specific question including as much information about your hardware and what you have tried!\nApplications\nNew applications on the other hand--as opposed to drivers--will have to be installed manually.  However, unlike Windows, Ubuntu manages software centrally using repositories--in short, you don't have to go find/download software yourself.  Ubuntu Software Center is one option for installing software (see this question) but you can also install from the command line usingsudo apt-get install software-name (see this question for more information on finding/installing software from the command line).  You can also download Debian packages (.deb) from the internet and manually install them (or compile software yourself from source code if you are feeling ambitious)--but it's much safer and more convenient to install from the repositories.  Welcome to Ubuntu!\n\nA: Unity (12.04)\nEnsure that you are connected to the internet, if you are installing wireless drivers then usually you need to be plugged in via an ethernet cable. Click on the Ubuntu logo in the launcher and type drivers and click on the icon that appears.\n\nIf you have hardware for which there are supporting drivers to download, they'll show up in this window and allow you to install them.

(Well, you could patch the kernel of course...).\nRemember that the load average is not a \"regular average\" of a set of numbers like you learned to compute in high school.  Keeping around samples for 15 minutes and computing 3 averages over that array several times a second would require way too much memory & CPU power.\nThe \"load average\" (on linux) is an exponentially damped/weighted moving average, meaning it indicates a trend over time.  See my answer to this related question for a couple of links to sites with more info.\nIf you know a bit of programming, it's actually easy to understand from the kernel sources too--that's how somebody teached me this.  See page 2 of the link to the Linux Journal article for that.\n\nA: What JanC explained is correct. However, you can compute this by measuring the run-queue length (number of active threads waiting for the CPU) of your system. Unfortunately there is no utility/tool available for Linux. If you want to play around this, you can do this on OpenSolris even with microseconds resolution using DTrace scripts. It is pretty much easy. You can easily find such a script on the WEB. \n", "Q: Any way to search for text within nano?

For more info see the LXDE wiki\n\nA: solved here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11108807&postcount=8\n\nIn order to get Dropbox to autostart at logon, I did this: made a new\n  file in my autostart folder here:\n/home/GUS/.config/autostart\n\n(you should change GUS to whatever your own username is) Call the file\n  Dropbox.desktop Open it in your text editor and paste these lines,\n  again changing GUS to your username in the line that starts with\n  \"Exec\":\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Dropbox\nComment=RunDropbox\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/elementary/panel/22/dropboxstatus-logo.svg\nExec=bash /home/GUS/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nSave it.

At some point, the filesystem on my digital audio player has become read-only. I cannot copy files into it or remove files on it.\nAre there some possible reasons for the player's file system to change permissions in this way?\nI tried using chmod:\n$ sudo chmod a+rw SGTL\\ MSCN/ \nchmod: changing permissions of `SGTL MSCN/': Read-only file system\n\nSGTL MSCN is the mount point of the digital audio player.\nWhat else can I try to make it writeable?\n\nA: I had this problem occur on several USB sticks.  Each time I searched for an answer and tried various suggestions, including using Terminal to run commands, reformatting on both Linux and Windows machines, etc. All to no avail.\nIt happened to me again today so again I went looking to see if I could find a solution.  I tried the things here, but they didn't work.\nOut of desperation I again went to Disk Utility.  I unmounted the drive and then hit \"Format\" on the partition portion, not the drive portion - USB only had the single partition.  This time it WORKED!!!!. Then I went to the drive portion and again reformatted the single partition as a master boot drive and monkeyed a bit more with it.  \nThe upshot is, I'm now able to read and write to the drive again.  \nI don't know if I just got lucky this time or not.  But it is working again.\n\nA: If the USB stick is mounted as read-only. Go to Disk Utility and unmount the disk. Then click on Check Filesystem if there are no problems remount the disk. After mounting the disk it should work correctly, at least that is how I solved this problem.\n\nA: For NTFS file systems this problem may occur when it is not properly unmounted (probably by unexpected shutdown of windows). In such cases the file systems are marked as locked.\nYou can mount them properly using the following ntfsfix command, for example:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda3\n\nPlease replace /dev/sda3 with your own device name.\n\nA: I couldn't easily take my problematic NTFS-formatted external drive back to the Windows system that had apparently failed to dismount it safely (causing Mint to insist on mounting it \"read-only\").\nBut the easy answer for me was to run the Mint \"Disks\" utility and select \"Repair filesystem\"...\n\n\nA: If a filesystem has been mounted read-only, chmod will not work since it's a write operation too.\nTry remounting it read-write:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw '/media/SGTL MSCN'\n\nIf the device has a write lock on it (like SD memory cards), you need to turn it off. Hardware locks cannot be disabled by software. Note that the write lock on SD memory cards is located from the sight you see the letters near the up left corner and it looks like a very small switch.\nSome filesystem drivers may also not support write operations, this is the case with the older NTFS module supported by Linux. For NTFS filesystems, be sure to use the ntfs-3g driver which should be picked automatically nowadays. If not, you can force the driver with something like:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o uid=$(id -u) /dev/sdb1 /mnt/\n\n(where /dev/sdb1 has to be substituted for your block device and /mnt/ for your destination)\n\nA: In case it is a fixed drive and not a removable drive, you can add the entry permanently.\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n\nAdd an entry in the following format:\n<file-system> <mount-point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>\n\nAnd then do:\nmount -a\n\n\nA: In Case of Dual Booting Operating System (for me Windows 10 and Linux Mint 19.1),\nwhen windows10 was not properly shutdown, this problem will occur to my disk partition on the Linux,\nThe Solution is to start up the Windows 10 then shut it down properly.\nNow you can write file to the partition on Linux again. \nHope this will help   \n", "Q: What programs can a user use to make the desktop more pleasant/enhance/better At this moment I know of Unity which looks much better than the default Gnome desktop that comes in 11.04.

What I see in my home directory are a number of hidden subdirectories.  These hidden subdirectories are often associated with personal configurations for various applications and/or applications that I have installed on an individual, instead of system, level.  \nOver the years I have been seeing the use of these hidden sub-directories increase.  A quick look at what is in my home directory leads me to believe that some commonality between Linux distributions does not necessarily exist.  It really depends on the application of choice.  That is, if I use Banshee in both Fedora and Ubuntu, I would expect that I would have similar configuration files.\nI am not certain this this response has actually answered your question.  Perhaps a better answer might be: \"It depends\".\n\nA: Some common hidden folders in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*.cache - The folder where user\nspecific non-essential data files\nshould be stored. Usually cached\ndata, like album covers for Banshee,\navatars for Empathy, etc.\n\n*.compiz - used by Compiz Window\nManager.\n\n*.config - The folder where user\nspecific configuration files should\nbe stored.\n\n*.dbus - used by the D-BUS message bus\nsystem.\n\n*.gconf - GConf settings.\n\n*.gnome2 - used by some GNOME 2\napplications like the GNOME keyring.\n\n*.gvfs - data folder for the GNOME\nvirtual filesystem.\n\n*.local/share - The folder where user\nspecific data files should be stored.\n\n*.mozilla - settings for the Mozilla\nFirefox web browser.\n\n*.pulse - used by the PulseAudio audio\nsystem.\n\n*.thumbnails - Thumbnails for\npictures, videos, etc. (used by Nautilus)\n\n\nYou can find more information in the XDG Base Directory Specification.\nMany applications have their own hidden folders like Shotwell (.shotwell), LibreOffice (.libreoffice) to store application-specific data.\n", "Q: How do I install Adobe AIR? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install Adobe AIR? \n\nI found some links, but they all seem a bit unsure, so I'm wondering if it is possible, and looking for simple (if possible) instructions.\n\nA: Check out this link.

Additionally, I ran the logwatch script inside /etc/cron.daily/ so I know the script is working. So I'm hoping that tomorrow around 6:30 AM that cron runs my daily logwatch script.\n\n*And ... Success! I'm going to summarize what I did and accept it as a best answer. \n\n\nA: The issue for me ended up being that cron had stopped working and thus even though logwatch was still running it was not emailing me a daily report.

Looking closer, I noticed that you've just removed some partitions from the middle of the disk and created new ones: the extended partition holding the swap, the root partition and another swap (in that order). You do not need two swaps, I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove one swap (sdb7)\n\n*expand the root partition (sdb5) with the space from the removed swap\n\n*shrink the root partition on the right\n\n*expand the swap (sdb6)\nTo do this, boot into a LiveCD and start the Disk Utility.\n\n\nThe output is OK, there is nothing wrong with it except for a strange partitioning order which is caused by removing / creating partitions. The sdb4 partition is a special one, the extended partition. All partitions with a number greater than 4 are logical partitions inside the extended partition. Partitions 1-3 are primary partitions.\nTh next time, do not mess that much with the system configuration files without making a backup of those.\nRegarding your fstab file, you don't have an encrypted root system, let alone a swap.

So you'd better replace the last two lines with:\n/dev/sdb7 none swap sw 0 0\n/dev/sdb6 none swap sw 0 0\n\nThe floppy one looks suspicious too, why would you automatically mount a floppy?

I think all the programs you critically need to recover your system only use libraries from /usr/lib.\nBoot to a text login prompt. If the normal boot doesn't give you a login: prompt in text mode, boot with only minimum services. Press and hold Shift when your computer starts to show the Grub prompt; you need to press the key after the BIOS has initialized the keyboard but before Grub is loaded, which on some machines leaves only a small time window and may require several attemps. At the Grub prompt, press Down to highlight the single-user mode boot entry and boot that.\nOnce you have a command line, run apt-get --reinstall install PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 … to reinstall the packages that have files in /usr/lib. You can run this shell snippet to get the list of names of packages to reinstall:\negrep -l '/usr/lib/[^/]*\\.so\\.' /var/lib/dpkg/info/a*.list |\nsed -e 's!^/var/lib/dpkg/info/!!' -e 's!\\.list$!!'\n\nSome package installation scripts may require libraries from other packages to be present, so you may need to run the reinstallations in a particular order. If you find that a package's installation scripts are trying to use a particular program, you can find out which libraries this program needs with ldd. For example, this indicates that python is missing three libraries that you need to reinstall:\n$ ldd /usr/bin/python | grep 'not found'\n    libssl.so.0.9.8 => not found\n    libcrypto.so.0.9.8 => not found\n    libz.so.1 => not found\n\ndpkg -S /usr/lib/libz.so.1 reveals that this file comes from zlib1g, and so on.\nIf you find that apt-get is unable to download packages, first download a few key packages from a live CD. zlib1g and libssl0.9.8 are two packages you're very likely to need early on.\n\nA: /usr/lib contained the shared libraries of, frankly, everything except startup-critical software (that's what goes into /lib/ and stuff you didn't install via the package manager (usually /usr/local/lib ).\nShort version, you just hosed your system.\nNow, if you still have /var/cache/apt/archives full of stuff, with a little judicious magickery  you might be able to salvage the situation.\nCheck if it still contains archives of for the following packages:\nlibxapian\nlibsigc++\napt\nlibcwidget\nlibsqlite\nlibboost-iostreams \n\nThose packages contain libraries in /usr/lib that aptitude requires to work If you can find the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives you can reinstall them manually with dpkg -i <packagename, and once they're all installed, aptitude should be able to run.\nThen by running the command aptitude reinstall ~i you'll force a reinstall of every package that was already installed, which hopefully should restore your system. I can't make absolute guarantees because the damage you did is really quite spectacular in this case...\n\nA: You can spend a week finding everything that's missing or you can spend an hour just doing a reinstall from CD and then getting all your old packages back.\nI'd suggest you boot into a LiveCD environment first to get backups of things first (copy them to an external USB drive, or another partition) and then start again.\n\nA: I'd be tempted to boot from a Ubuntu 11.04 live-CD and attempt to copy the missing files back.\nBefore doing anything, check you have good backups of any user-generated data files. If not, I'd boot a live-CD mount the HDD read-only and make backups ASAP.\n\nA: When I did something similar, I was lucky enough to realise before attempting a reboot. At this point, your system will be still mostly working. My approach was to create a virtualbox with the same version of the OS and copy the missing files from that. if you allow ssh access into your virtualbox guest you can use rsync from a terminal on your main system to suck in only the files and links that are missing. In my case there were few enough files missing that it was easiest/safest to copy manually using scp, so the following is untested(!)\nsudo rsync -avu user@guestVB:/usr/lib /usr/lib\n\n-a is archive mode (recursive, copies symlinks, and attributes including timestamps, permissions etc)\n-u skips if destination copy is newer\n-v is verbose\n", "Q: How to have my PHP Send mail? I installed Ubuntu 11.04, LAMP using tasksel.\nI find that PHP mail() does not work.\nI suppose I need to enable it or something? How do I do that?\n\nA: As already noted, postfix would be an overkill if you just need to send emails from php while developing applications on your home computer.\nI personally use very simple and lightweight package ssmtp. It will use any smtp server to send outbound emails.\nInstall it by running:\nsudo apt-get install ssmtp\n\nThen edit /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf file, comment out existing mailhub line and add the following lines (this example is for gmail smtp server):\nmailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587\nUseSTARTTLS=YES\nAuthUser=<YOUR-EMAIL>@gmail.com\nAuthPass=<YOUR-PASSWORD>\n\n(Provide your gmail username & password. Of course you can use any other SMTP server).\nNow make sure that your php.ini has correct sendmail_path. It should read as:\nsendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t\n\n(From comments of @dima-l and @omar-sabic: You do not have to specify ssmtp here because the installation should have created a symlink for /usr/sbin/sendmail, which correctly points to ssmtp. Otherwise you have to specify sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/ssmtp -t)\nReload apache and your php should be able to send outgoing emails now.\n\nA: From the mail manual of php:\n\nRequirements\nFor the mail functions to be\n  available, PHP requires an installed\n  and working email system. The program\n  to be used is defined by the\n  configuration settings in the php.ini\n  file.\n\nThis means you have to install some sort of mailserver and configure php to use it. Usually this mailserver is postfix in Ubuntu. However - if the php side you are coding will eventually be stored on a hosting service's side (e.g. xmission), a mail server will most likely already be installed there. In that case just test your site online instead of locally.\nIf you need to test it on your own system or mean to host it on your own home-server than proceed with:\nPostfix Installation\nInstallation: postfix  / sudo apt-get install postfix\nDuring the process you will be asked in which mode you want postfix installed. There are four possible modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internet: Your own mail-server.\n\n*Satellite: An extern mail provider (e.g. Google) will be used for sending and receiving mail. The server will not receive any mail.\n\n*Smarthost: Mixture between the two. Mail is stored locally but sent through an external mail provider.\n\n*Local only: Will not concern you. That's a system intern mailserver. You can only send mail from user to user on the system.\n\n\nThe rest of the install options depend on your choice of this general configuration.\nMost likely you will choose a satellite install. That means mail will be sent using an extern provider. As smtp-server (outgoing mail server) you will then have to specify your providers smtp. The rest of the options is self explanatory.\nPost Installation Configuration\nMost smtp-servers require a password authentication to send mail. So postfix will need to know that password. Also there are things like encryption to consider (which you'll have to google). This is how you configure postfix using password authentication (sasl):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install \nlibsasl2-modules  and \nsasl2-bin \nby clicking the Software Center icons or from terminal using:\nsudo apt-get install libsasl2-2 libsasl2-modules sasl2-bin\n\n\n*Enable sasl-auth by adding these lines to /etc/postfix/main.cf\n # add to /etc/postfix/main.cf\n smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\n smtp_sasl_security_options = noplaintext noanonymous\n smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_password\n\n\n*Create a file /etc/postfix/sasl_password with a line like:\n smtp.gmail.com USERNAME@gmail.com:USERPASSWORD\n\nSubstitute the actual password, username and smtp-address.\n\n*Update postfix:\n sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_password # for safety of your smtp password\n sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_password \n sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sender_canonical\n sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart   \n\nYou might have to circumvent the 'permission denied' bug by chown postfix:postfix /etc/postfix beforehand.\nThis should do it in most of the cases. Yet some smtp providers require a specific address as the sender or encryption.\nRelated: PEAR::Mail interface might also be of interest to you.\nGmail (and perhaps other services) may not like it that you are attempting to send mail this way as it could be deemed insecure by their standards, and would block your attempt i.e. nothing will happen on the screen or someplace of the whole process would block your authentication. Also your POP3 must be enabled.\nTo counter that see here. (If you want to be on the safe side, then create a dummy Gmail account)\n\nA: Should be a simple fix. You just need to install Postfix which does the actual emailing.\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\nYou want to run that from a terminal (and not the software centre) because it needs to ask you a few setup questions. You should be find to just accept all the defaults (local-only, etc).\n\nA: PHP requires an SMTP client to send mail.  You could install a full-featured mail transfer agent (MTA) like Postfix to serve this function, but it's overkill if you only need to send mail through PHP.  Instead, install msmtp.  It's lightweight and much simpler to configure.\nInstall msmtp\nsudo apt-get install msmtp-mta ca-certificates\n\nConfigure it\nCreate a new configuration file:\nsudo vi /etc/msmtprc\n\n...with the following configuration information:\n# Set defaults.\ndefaults\n\n# Enable or disable TLS/SSL encryption.\ntls on\ntls_starttls on\ntls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n\n# Set up a default account's settings.\naccount default\nhost <smtp.example.net>\nport 587\nauth on\nuser <username@example.net>\npassword <password>\nfrom <address-to-receive-bounces@example.net>\nsyslog LOG_MAIL\n\nYou need to replace the configuration data represented by everything within \"<\" and \">\" (inclusive, remove these). For host/username/password, use your normal credentials for sending mail through your mail provider.\nTell PHP to use it\nsudo vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nAdd this single line:\nsendmail_path = /usr/bin/msmtp -t\n\n\nA: This is an old question and there are worthy answers above, but I needed exim for my environment. Also, confirm you have sendmail installed in the first place ($ which sendmail -- should return something like /usr/sbin/sendmail). I found a good guide at linode.com, but the gist is:\napt-get install exim4-daemon-light mailutils\n\nfollowed by:\ndpkg-reconfigure exim4-config\n\nwhich will get you to an interactive editor.\n\nA: Great answer, con-f-use. \nI have one thing to add about the \"dummy gmail account\": \nThis is highly recommended because you have to configure your gmail account to allow less secure applications: https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/security/lesssecureapps\nOtherwise you will get a \"please log in using your web browser and then try again\" error in your /var/log/mail.log file.\nalso I found that I get a timeout error unless I send the gmail smtp sever my root certificate. To do this:\nsudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf\n\nadd the following to the bottom of the file\nsmtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem\n\nThen copy the thawte root cert to the cacert.pem file:\ncat /etc/ssl/certs/thawte_Primary_Root_CA.pem | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/cacert.pem\n\nHere is the link I used : Configure Postfix to Use Gmail SMTP on Ubuntu | EasyEngine\nHopefully this saves someone a few hair follicles...\n\nA: I found the solutions provided by Dima L. is the most easiest way & lightweight to system.\nJust some addition for more clarity on setting. You should comment hostname in /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf file. The sample ssmtp.conf file is as below:\n#\n# Config file for sSMTP sendmail\n#\n# The person who gets all mail for userids < 1000\n# Make this empty to disable rewriting.\nroot=postmaster\n\n# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required no \n# MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com\nmailhub=smtp.yourdomain.com\nUseSTARTTLS=YES\nAuthUser=mail@yourdomain.com\nAuthPass=YOUREMAILPASSWORD\n\n# Where will the mail seem to come from?\n#rewriteDomain=\n\n# The full hostname\n#hostname=\n\n# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?\n# YES - Allow the user to specify their own From: address\n# NO - Use the system generated From: address\nFromLineOverride=YES\n\n", "Q: Audio backend for 11.04? Often the audio quality is very bad so I've to restart the audio backend. \nWhen I'm using ALSA I can't since the command to restart it seems not to find the file (strange as ALSA works..) when I'm use pulseaudio, I can restart with pulseaudio -k in a terminal. \nOSS  never worked to me. When Ubuntu used ESD, the audio always worked (Ubuntu 10.04 or maybe earlier).\nSomeone encountered similiar problem? Which backend do you use? \nI've an integrated nvidia soundboard (MCP77/78 HDMI).\n\nA: Ubuntu has been using a very similar stack to the current one (PulseAudio on ALSA) by default since 8.04. If 10.04 worked for you, I'd take off the rose-tinted glasses because they're lying to you. Each sound system has its pros and cons. PulseAudio is just the best of a imperfect mix for most people.\nThe command to restart ALSA (on 11.04) is:\nsudo /etc/init.d/alsasound restart\n\nYou might need to install the alsa-utils package. That just does a load of things with alsactl.\nAs for poor sound quality, I find that sometimes funny balance/fade settings can cause major distortion. A tool like padevchooser's mixer might help you straighten things out.\n\nA: To configure audio settings that affect sound quality we have a configuration file /etc/pulse/daemon.conf where we can fine tune a lot of settings, depending on your indivdual system or problem. This file can be edited as root with any editor.\nFor my system the following settings turned out to be fine (leaving all other parameters commented out):\nresample-method = speex-float-1\ndefault-fragments = 8\ndefault-fragment-size-msec = 10\n\nAlways make a backup of this file before editing in case you made changes that break your audio.\n", "Q: How to attach new EBS volume to Ubuntu machine on AWS? Disclaimer: I'm probably missing something obvious, sorry in advance.\nI need more EBS disk space for my Ubuntu 11.04 server running on Amazon EC2, and decided to create new volume in addition to the root volume. (It's an EBS-backed instance, created from official Ubuntu AMIs.)\nSo, I opened AWS management console, created a volume, and attached it to the instance:\n\nI chose /dev/sdb as suggested by the dialog. AWS console shows the volume as correctly attached to the instance.\nProblem is, the device /dev/sdb is not available on the instance, not immediately nor after reboot: \n$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb\nmke2fs 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010)\nCould not stat /dev/sdb --- No such file or directory\n\nDid I miss some necessary step, or is the volume available under some other device name? \n(Also tried /dev/sdc with same result; /dev/xvda3 wasn't accepted as \"valid EBS device name\".)\n\nA: The devices are named /dev/xvdX rather than sdX in 11.04. This was a kernel change.  The kernel name for xen block devices is 'xvd'.  Previously Ubuntu carried a patch to rename those devices as sdX.  That patch became problematic.\nYou could, if you really wanted, run your own kernel with a patch applied.\nbug 684875 has more information on why this was changed.\nSo, to answer your question, attach it /dev/sdb, it will appear as /dev/xvdb.\n", "Q: Good Download Manager for Ubuntu \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan someone recommend a download manager? \n\nCan you recommand any download manager for Ubuntu?\nFeatures I'm looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Works in Unity env.\n\n*Can download from rapidshare.\n\n*Supports sceduled downloads.\n\n\nThere is Transmission BitTorrent Client installed by default, but it supports only torrent downloads and have no scheduling support.\n\nA: uGet is great.\n\nUget (formerly urlgfe) is a Free and Open Source download manager written in GTK+ , it has many of features like easy-to-use , cross-platform (Windows & GNU/Linux) , support pause and resume , classify download , every category has an independent configuration , and...\n\nSome new features in new version as uGet homepage says:\n\nWhat’s new since 1.6:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*support for Torrent and Metalink file (with aria2 plug-in).\n  \n*support for application indicator.\n  \n*It can do speed limit control per download.\n  \n*It can sort downloads by column in “All” category.\n  \n*add scheduler.\n  \n*add new plug-in that support aria2 version >= 1.10.\n  \n*add new timestamp columns – “Added On” and “Completed On”.\n  \n*add configure option “–with-gtk3″ to enable GTK+3 support.\n  \n*add Belarusian translation file (Mihas Varantsou)\n  \n*move web site from http://urlget.sourceforge.net/ to http://uget.visuex.com/\n\n\nInstall it using these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:plushuang-tw/uget-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install uget\n\n\nA: Steadyflow 0.1.7\n\nSteadyflow is an easy to use download manager for Ubuntu.

You just need to run export DISPLAY=:0 (or whatever the remote display is numbered as) in your ssh session and programs run will run on the remote display. A quick example:\noli@bert:~$ ssh tim\noli@tim:~$ export DISPLAY=:0\noli@tim:~$ firefox\n\nFirefox is now running on tim's display.\nHowever when you close your ssh session, most of the time the remote application will close. If you want to disconnect from ssh but leave the application running you need to launch it in a special way using something like screen (keeps the ssh session running in the background) or nohup, or another method. For more information on this there was recently another question on it.\nYou can shorten this all down into one command that will connect, export the display in-line and start the application in a way that won't close it after the ssh session dies:\nssh tim \"DISPLAY=:0 nohup firefox\"\n\n\nA: Depends on where you want to see the application displayed\nTo display the application on your local PC\nYou first ssh to the remote computer with the additional -Y option and the run the application (e.g. firefox):\nssh -Y ...\nfirefox\n\nIf -Y doesn't work check you sshd config on the remote PC (see Denis Lukinykh's answer). Another similar option is -X.

Afterwards you can ssh with the same user A and start the application (e.g. firefox) like this:\nssh A@...\nDISPLAY=:0 nohup firefox\n\nTo display the application nowhere\nYou need to install & start xvfb. xvfb will create an invisible X session at DISPLAY 10.

So after entering sudo gedit index.theme change all the old theme names to the new one:\n\nString, search and replace Equinox Evolution Midnight -> Rinzwind\nIconTheme and CursorTheme I will keep for now but editing these 2 is almost the same as for this theme.\nAnd now we have a new name for an old theme:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a new theme\n\n\nInside our new directory are 2 sets of images:\n\n\nWith an image editor (Gimp) you can change the colors or do various things on the images.\nMake sure to keep the same size of the image and of course use sane colors (stick to one color and 1 or 2 shades of this color to make a theme and not something that gives people instant headaches).\nRecreate these 2 directories in your Pictures folder by copying the theme to your Pictures. I copied the 2 directories inside the theme and removed all directories that are not images with this as a result:\n\nOpen all the images inside gimp and start editing them and when you are satisfied copy them over with to your theme's directory and check if it works.\nRemark: since the theme is owned by root you need to use sudo to copy it over.\n\n*\n\n*What GIMP tutorials are available?\n\nA: 11.10 and above\nCreating a theme for 11.10 and above (GTK+3) is fortunately very similar to 11.04 and previous versions of Ubuntu that used GTK+2.  This answer is based on the already excellent answer from Rinzwind.\nIts easier to amend an existing theme rather than to tackle a theme from scratch.  In addition - its easier to edit a theme in your own local home folder - this avoids permissions issues etc.\nLets create a new theme that called foss based upon the Ambiance theme. Obviously - if you have any other GTK+3 themes installed, use those (see linked Q&A for where to get themes)\nInstall themes are stored in /usr/share/themes/ - local themes are stored in your home folder under the folder-name .themes\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Create a local foss theme folder  mkdir -p ~/.themes/foss\n\n*cp -R /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/* ~/.themes/foss\nInside the new folder is a file named index.theme that needs to be changed to the new theme name.\ngedit ~/.themes/foss/index.theme change all the old theme names to the new one.\n\nAnd now we have a new name called foss:\n\nEditing the new theme\n\nInside our new directory are two key folders - Unity and gtk-3.0:\n\nWith an image editor such as Pinta or Gimp you can change the colours or do various things on the images within those folders.\n\nMake sure to keep the same size of the image and of course use sane colors (stick to one color and 1 or 2 shades of this color to make a theme).\nOpen all the images inside Pinta/Gimp and start editing them and when you are satisfied copy them over with to your theme's directory.\nHowever - the main part of theme editing is changing the various .css files in those folders (and the subfolder Apps).\n\nCascading-Style-Sheets is a well-defined stylesheet language that changes the look and feel of associated objects - in our case a theme - but equally applies to HTML web pages and documents.\nIt isn't for the uninitiated to edit these - fortunately there are some very good tools to allow you to edit & preview CSS changes - see the linked Q&A below.\nOnce you are happy with your theme - set your theme via Ubuntu-Tweak\n\nUnfortunately you cannot change themes via the standard Appearance screen - the themes there are hard-coded in 11.10 & 12.04.\n\nLinked Questions:\n\n*\n\n*CSS editor with real-time preview and selector localization\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu-Tweak?\n\n*What GIMP tutorials are available?\n\n*Is there a program like Microsoft Paint?\n\n*Where to find great themes?\n", "Q: How to disable all GUI elements and boot to command prompt Cross post from Serverfault\nI have a laptop I'm running as a file server, which is running Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop. Now that summer heat is here, and because I love the environment, I'm look for all sorts of ways to reduce the laptop's power/memory/heat footprint.\nOne part I never touch any more is the GUI as the lids always closed.\nI thought perhaps simply removing GDM from all run-levels my achieve this, so I did so using sysv-rc-conf. However this didn't make any difference and upon reboot the lovely Ubuntu boot screen and graphical login prompt appeared.\nPlease help!\nAdditionally, perhaps this is a silly question, I want to make sure that the monitor is off at all times the lid is closed, which it is already set to do when the GUI is running, can/do I need to configure this separately for non-GUI environments? (Seems to be doing this fine)\nThanks :D\nEDIT: Ok maybe I'm using sysv-rc-conf wrong and it needed 2 reboots to apply the settings or something? As rebooting it a second time since removing GDM from all run levels I got a command prompt.\nHowever I didn't watch it reboot and was a little confused by this, so I rebooted what I believe to be a 3rd time, and now it's booted to a black screen with a solitary white underline in the top-left, no other text. No amount of keyboard mashing in order to change run levels is having any effect, however I am able to access it via SSH and the SMB shares, so I suppose it's doing almost what I want. The lack of a CLI on the screen itself is still concerning however.\n\nA: Re-purpose using tasksel\nInstall sudo apt-get install tasksel \nrun sudo tasksel\nUncheck ubuntu-desktop\nCheck basic server \n\nA: Be careful, currently, the documentation says you should only use tasksel to install tasks, never to remove any (see bug details)\n", "Q: Does Upstart emit hooks for SysV jobs? I want to make an Upstart job start immediately before a System V job (/etc/rc0.d/S40umountfs). I've tried specifying:\nstart on starting umountfs\n\nbut Upstart doesn't recognize the name of the script:\n$ initctl check-config \ncollapsefs\n  start on: unknown job umountfs\n\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: SysV init scripts are run by the rc job (/etc/init/rc.conf) which just runs /etc/init.d/rc $RUNLEVEL.\nSo there's only an upstart event for the whole runlevel, but not for single init scripts.\nYou can create an event using initctl emit umountfs.\nSee Upstart Intro, Cookbook and Best Practices for some tips on using Upstart.\n", "Q: Commandline tool for viewing xls files Is there a commandline tool for viewing/opening excel (.xls) files?\nSo the answer works great unless the worksheets don't have a custom name.  \nWhen I try to open the file, I get:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/py_xls2csv\", line 17, in <module>\n    for sheet_name, values in parse_xls(arg, 'cp1251'): # parse_xls(arg) -- default encoding\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pyExcelerator/ImportXLS.py\", line 334, in parse_xls\n    raise Exception, 'No workbook stream in file.'\nException: No workbook stream in file.\n\nHowever, if I open up the file and rename the sheet to 'test' or something it works fine.  What do I need to tweak so that it can handle the default names?  (Sheet1, etc)\nThe file I'm trying to open at present has only 1 sheet, named Sheet1.\n\nA: Yeah it's a little bit hacky though. Let's start by installing two packages:\nsudo apt-get install python-excelerator w3m\n\nFrom there, we use a script that comes bundled with python-excelerator to convert the document into a HTML file. We then pipe that into a command line browser (w3m) and display it.\npy_xls2html spreadsheet.xls 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\"//g' | w3m -dump -T 'text/html'\n\nYou can create a bash function or alias with that if you don't want to keep typing it.

I'm not particularly bothered by them at this point.\nIf you don't need it to be as tabular you could simply have something like this:\npy_xls2csv spreadsheet.xls 2>&1 | less\n\nYou can go one further than that and display it in a slightly nicer way:\npy_xls2csv spreadsheet.xls 2>&1 | grep '^\"' | sed 's/\"//g' | column -s, -t | less -#2 -N -S\n\nThat gives you the following:\n  1 this   is    a       spreadsheet\n  2 it     is    very    nice\n  3 this   has   three   rows\n\n\nA: Here is a method which maintains the Unicode characters.\nie. it displays आ , rather than dislaying the Unicode Codepoint value \\U0906 \nThe script uses OpenOffice.org and PyODConverter.py to convert one OOo document format into other OOo format.

I setup an instance of Ubuntu on Amazon EC2 using an AMI that I had found.  When I login to the server through SSH it says \nA newer build of the Ubuntu lucid server image is available.\nIt is names 'release' and has a build serial '20110201.1'.\n\nWhat I found online was that I should run do-release-upgrade -d to upgrade the distribution.  When I ran it though it seems to try to upgrade to Maverick Meerkat.  I want to upgrade to the LTS release.\nIs there a way that I can upgrade my server without rebuilding it?\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) is currently the most recent LTS.  Based on the message you've given above, it seems that you're already running 10.04, and thus, there is no newer LTS.\nNow, some other points:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've written documentation on how to upgrade kernels in 10.04 in a blog post.\n\n*If you are able to upgrade your instance's kernel (as described above), then the message is a bug, and it can be ignored (bug 653220)\n\n\nThe fact that \"Ubuntu on EC2\" is different than \"Plain Ubuntu Server\" is mostly historic at this point.  If you launch new instances based on the most recent Ubuntu images for any currently supported release other than 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron), then you can simply sudo do-release-upgrade or \"dist-upgrade\" and ignore that message.\n", "Q: When installing .deb files, does its PPA install too? When installing .deb files to install software, does its PPA also get installed into software sources?\nI ask because if I find some software online which has a .deb download, I tend to look for its PPA, add it to my sources, then go through Synaptic to install the software. I do this because I want future updates for it.\nBut this is a longer process than installing .deb files with gdebi.\n\nA: Not unless the author of the .deb has specifically added this, like Google does for their chrome .deb, it installs their repository and adds their GPG key \nOther than Google Chrome I can't think of another third party .deb that does this kind of thing, PPA or otherwise, so the general answer appears to be \"no\".\n\nA: No, the ppa is usually not installed per default when you install a DEB file using Gdebi or the Software Center.\nNevertheless your approach with looking for a ppa if there is one is a good idea as you have\n\n\n*\n\n*regular updates\n\n*a known source in case you trust the ppa you use\n\n\nSome packages however are not available through a ppa, some don't even come with a DEB file.\n", "Q: How do I migrate to a newer Python version and still use packages in the old version? On Ubuntu 10.04 I recently installed Python 2.7.1 (ActivePython from ActiveState).

Is it possible to import the packages from 2.6.5 into 2.7.1 or do I risk running into compatibility issues?\n\nA: This is a better way of installing Python 2.7 into Ubuntu 10.04. What's the best way to get Python 2.5 and 2.7\n\nA: You'll run into compatibility issues with packages with binary modules, including pygtk.\nAs far as I understand, the ActiveState distribution is okay on windows where there's no native python, but external binary packages look less attractive on ubuntu. Your other options are upgrading to ubuntu 10.10, which I'd recommend, compiling your own python for your home, staying python2.6 compatible, or backporting the python2.7 package from 10.10.\n", "Q: Weird Characters On gzip Package I'm trying to gzip my js files which in js folder.\ngzip -cr js\n\nI'm using this command on Terminal but this is result:\n8�H�Q�YUG�`]{_��a\"G9xj�C�!��Y �c�S�ؙ�SY�}���-mU�����w��@f�x��\n                                                                         Q)���k������;�Nߪ�7�x�z�[�Y1E ��\n�b�ŹV���ز�7�W���k���!�Z���奩�Vi�HC��r�R��Nj�Q�k�SV[XnL=(v٧p'Ҽ�o�E�P)���vkﱮX|-�t�ii��b!�vF�~F��� �|X���*b\n3��y�#�s��8k(��L�o�4�7y�NeNָ��а��(�R��+e^�g�5$��.$tD�{ʔ�YcQ�Z+\ncx�\n   Ӧc�5�-0Um���Qݫ�B���B�.5 ��U0��?N��1�TOC����-�����#�[j�Je9���J�nv��J���r�us����ϸ����~����Ğ�c_'��q�=��J���^    >���d���F������KRV綶�yꮖ�8��O�׶=Qz@���NqI{Ḧ������7yM=\ny�N�e��.'K�|�ZJ��1�ᬇL�  ��s\n                        H��ش�6y*(k�{|�ఱ�    \n.�KyDi���࿒���k�G�LZ��rsR�ϫ�)e�Nj����Id�64����_�R8U�2�'���^��;�  �<Y����ͨm�+���K�]R��ǝ'��p[_I ��t��E���-Z�ٙAQ3��@넁�-�m'�+�b����G���~���\n                                                               [u�Pps�Q<�㖈x̓a�m�ܪ�������쒁����**z�*K]L�Nf8A�L��d���5�ݗ����O����_Y��P:��\n����o��\n        ����q]��V��<�!Kd݅��e� ��*|%���\n                                      jJc�'p�w�J��Q,��D��a�e�*#Ɖ��1�4|��+3D�}t��Hh(��^Ϭ�j��$��#��P��\\>J5����A��J��jO�¿\n\nWhat do you think, what's the problem ?

Some videos have stereo audio, but audio only plays out of one channel (only plays out of left speaker or only out of right speaker).  Unfortunately, remixing these to mono with something like ffmpeg is not an option.  Is there any way to make Ubuntu play the left stereo channel through both speakers (and vice versa, when necessary)?\n\nA: It will depend very much on what video playback application you are using. This is very easy to accomplish using mplayer, for example:\n$ mplayer some_file.avi -af channels=1\n\n\nA: If you use VLC, when watching a video, right click the screen and you can select from pure stereo, of just a single channel, to be treated as the audio for the track.\n", "Q: Understanding this shell statement I admit it is a homework but I am lost in explaining the following command line:\nWARNING: This is a so called FORK BOMB!
