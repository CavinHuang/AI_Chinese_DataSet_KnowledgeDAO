I installed Ubuntu on my laptop with dual boot alongside Windows 8. Now I would like to replace windows 8 fully with Ubuntu. Should I go through the installation process all over again? Will doing this erase all of the programs I have already installed? I apologize if this is a duplicate question. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you. \n\nA: No, you dont need to install ubuntu again. You can simply format the partition in which your windows reside and it will remove it. Use gparted for that. After formatting the windows partition do this to remove it from grub(os selection menu) too,\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: When I Plug In the HDMI Cable From My TV To Watch Content From My Laptop To The TV I get Two Different Screens OK guys heres the dilemma. I want to watch NCIS from my laptop on my big screen tv but when I plug the HDMI cable from the TV to the laptop, the screen thats on my laptop is different from the one that is displayed on the TV. Its the same wallpaper but without anything thats on the desktop and I don't know how to switch them or put on the right screen.\n\nA: That's a feature, not a bug. Some people use more than one monitor. You should be able to drag a window from your laptop to your TV just like you drag a window from place to place on one screen. Alternatively, you could set the TV to mirror the laptop, but you'd then get the lowest resolution of the two on both. You could also turn off the laptop monitor and have the TV be the only active monitor.\nGo to \"system settings\" via the Dash menu and select \"Monitors\". You can plat with the settings until you find what you want for your particular viewing needs.\n", "Q: Cannot get \"alias\" command to work at al Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nI open a terminal, and type a simple alias command, but then it doesn't work:\n~> alias ge='gedit &'\n~> ge\nge: command not found\n\nI've also tried adding aliases to .bashrc, .profile, .bash_aliases, all to no avail.

That involves editing your /etc/fstab.\nFirst make sure your present home folder is empty. Then find out what is the partition name of your home drive, use sudo fdisk -l for that. I am going to assume its /dev/sdaX for this post, replace it with yours.\nThen find out its uuid\nsudo blkid | grep /dev/sdaX\n\nTake note of UUID and TYPE. Now open your fstab file for editing\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nFill in a new entry like this,\nUUID=xxxxx  /home  ext4  rw,relatime,data=ordered   0 2\n\nReplace xxxxx with your uuid and ext4 with your TYPE. You could change spaces between columns as you see fit. Reboot your linux and you're done!!\nIMPORTANT NOTE!\nIf you have a separate partition for /home already , you will have to remove its entry from /etc/fstab as you can't mount two drives to same folder.\n", "Q: How to host a website from my local machine?

If I do a tar -ztvf z, it says that it is not gzipped.\nI finally found that changing the command to tar -zcvpf works perfectly. Somehow, putting the z parameter first works correctly, however putting it last (i.e. tar -cvpfz ...) does not!\nman tar seems to indicate that the - is optional, and one would think the tar command should work identically with or without the -.\nHopefully this will help someone else who, like me, added the -, thinking it was just a stylistic difference that wouldn't change the command.\nSince I am curious, and would love to learn more about this, can anyone shed light on why this happens?\n\nA: The -f option should be followed by a file or device name. When using tar cvpfz target.tar.gz dir1 you are actually using the so-called \"Old Option Style\" where\n\nWhen options that need arguments are given together with the command, all the associated arguments follow, in the same order as the options. (tar info page)\n\n\nA: Muru really answered the question with the links he posted, but due to his encouragement, I will re-copy one of his links and recap my comments here to hopefully make it easier to see the answer.\nAccording to this StackExchange link, the f parameter for the tar command is somewhat special, as it requires an argument (an archive filename) that immediately follows the f parameter, if you are preceding your parameters with a - (e.g. tar -cf).  However, as the answer in the link mentions, it may be safer to just forgo the -, so the f parameter doesn't risk treating any parameters you may put after the f as a filename.\nThis was the problem I ran into as stated in my question, since I tried to put the z parameter right after the f (e.g. tar -cvpfz) which caused the tar command to greedily 'consume' the z and treat it as the archive filename argument to the f parameter, rather than treating the z as simply the tar command's gzip parameter.\nIn brief, by omitting the - (e.g. using tar cvpfz ... rather than tar -cvpfz ..) the problem that I encountered can be avoided.  Now I know why.

In effect, it's similar to running wc by itself, typing in words, then pressing CtrlD\nIn bash these are implemented via temp files, usually in the form /tmp/sh-thd.<random string>, while in dash they are implemented as anonymous pipes. This can be observed via tracing system calls with strace command. Replace bash with sh to see how /bin/sh performs this redirection.\n$ strace -e open,dup2,pipe,write -f bash -c 'cat <<EOF\n> test\n> EOF'\n\nHere string\n<<< is known as here-string. Instead of typing in text, you give a pre-made string of text to a program. For example, with such program as bc we can do bc <<< 5*4 to just get output for that specific case, no need to run bc interactively. Think of it as the equivalent of echo '5*4' | bc.\nHere-strings in bash are implemented via temporary files, usually  in the format /tmp/sh-thd.<random string>, which are later unlinked, thus making them occupy some memory space temporarily but not show up in the list of /tmp directory entries, and effectively exist as anonymous files, which may still be referenced via file descriptor by the shell itself, and that file descriptor being inherited by the command and later duplicated onto file descriptor 0 (stdin) via dup2() function. This can be observed via\n$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/ <<< \"TEST\"\ntotal 0\nlr-x------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 13:43 0 -> /tmp/sh-thd.761Lj9 (deleted)\nlrwx------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 13:43 1 -> /dev/pts/4\nlrwx------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 13:43 2 -> /dev/pts/4\nlr-x------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 13:43 3 -> /proc/10068/fd\n\nAnd via tracing syscalls (output shortened for readability; notice how temp file is opened as fd 3, data written to it, then it is re-opened with O_RDONLY flag as fd 4 and later unlinked, then dup2() onto fd 0, which is inherited by cat later ):\n$ strace -f -e open,read,write,dup2,unlink,execve bash -c 'cat <<< \"TEST\"'\nexecve(\"/bin/bash\", [\"bash\", \"-c\", \"cat <<< \\\"TEST\\\"\"], [/* 47 vars */]) = 0\n...\nstrace: Process 10229 attached\n[pid 10229] open(\"/tmp/sh-thd.uhpSrD\", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600) = 3\n[pid 10229] write(3, \"TEST\", 4)         = 4\n[pid 10229] write(3, \"\\n\", 1)           = 1\n[pid 10229] open(\"/tmp/sh-thd.uhpSrD\", O_RDONLY) = 4\n[pid 10229] unlink(\"/tmp/sh-thd.uhpSrD\") = 0\n[pid 10229] dup2(4, 0)                  = 0\n[pid 10229] execve(\"/bin/cat\", [\"cat\"], [/* 47 vars */]) = 0\n...\n[pid 10229] read(0, \"TEST\\n\", 131072)   = 5\n[pid 10229] write(1, \"TEST\\n\", 5TEST\n)       = 5\n[pid 10229] read(0, \"\", 131072)         = 0\n[pid 10229] +++ exited with 0 +++\n--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=10229, si_uid=1000, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---\n+++ exited with 0 +++\n\nOpinion: potentially because here strings make use of temporary text files, it is the possible reason why here-strings always insert a trailing newline, since text file by POSIX definition has to have lines that end in newline character.\nProcess Substitution\nAs tldp.org explains,\n\nProcess substitution feeds the output of a process (or processes) into\nthe stdin of another process.\n\nSo in effect this is similar to piping stdout of one command to the other , e.g. echo foobar barfoo | wc . But notice: in the bash manpage you will see that it is denoted as <(list). So basically you can redirect output of multiple (!) commands.\nNote: technically when you say < < you aren't referring to one thing, but two redirection with single  < and process redirection of output from <( . . .).\nNow what happens if we do just process substitution?\n$ echo <(echo bar)\n/dev/fd/63\n\nAs you can see, the shell creates temporary file descriptor /dev/fd/63 where the output goes (which according to Gilles's answer, is an anonymous pipe). That means  < redirects that file descriptor as input into a command.\nSo very simple example would be to make process substitution of output from two echo commands into wc:\n$ wc < <(echo bar;echo foo)\n      2       2       8\n\nSo here we make shell create a file descriptor for all the output that happens in the parenthesis and redirect that as input to wc .As expected, wc receives that stream from two echo commands, which by itself would output two lines, each having a word, and appropriately we have 2 words, 2 lines, and 6 characters plus two newlines counted.\nHow is process substitution implemented ?

Then all these subprocesses communicate back via their stdout , but that is duplicated (that is copied) onto the stack of next available file descriptors starting at 63 downwards. Why start at 63 ? That may be a good question for the developers. It is known for a fact that bash can use fd 255 for saving file descriptors for the \"main\" command/pipeline  when its streams are redirected.\nSide Note: Process substitution may be referred to as a bashism (a command or structure usable in advanced shells like bash, but not specified by POSIX), but it was implemented in ksh before bash's existence as ksh man page and this answer suggest.\nShells like tcsh and mksh however do not have process substitution. So how could we go around redirecting output of multiple commands into another command without process substitution? Grouping plus piping!\n$ (echo foo;echo bar) | wc\n      2       2       8\n\nEffectively this is the same as above example, However, this is different under the hood from  process substitution, since we make stdout of the whole subshell and stdin of wc linked with the pipe. On the other hand, process substitution makes a command read a temporary file descriptor.\nSo if we can do grouping with piping, why do we need process substitution? Because sometimes we cannot use piping. Consider the example below - comparing outputs of two commands with diff (which needs two files, and in this case we are giving it two file descriptors)\ndiff <(ls /bin) <(ls /usr/bin)\n\n\nA: < < is a syntax error, you probably mean command1 < <( command2 ) which is a simple input redirection followed by a process substitution and is very similar but not equivalent to :\ncommand2 | command1\n\nThe difference assuming you are running bash is command1 is run in a subshell in the second case while it is run in the current shell in the first one. That means variables set in command1 would not be lost with the process substitution variant. \n\nA: < < will give an syntax error. Proper use is as follows:\nExplaining with the help of examples:\nExample for < <():\nwhile read line;do\n   echo $line\ndone< <(ls)\n\nIn the above example, the input to the while loop will come from the ls command which can be read line by line and echoed in the loop.\n<() is used for process substitution. More information and example for <() can be found at this link:\nProcess substitution and pipe\n", "Q: How do I change the default name for a new folder?

I use Samba to share the folders and set up a cron job with rsync to pull data from W7 to Ubuntu later that night: rsync -avhP /media/w7photo/ /media/storage/photos\nWhen I got the email output from cron, I found there had been a few issues:\nrsync: failed to set times on \"/media/storage/photos/2014\": Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: failed to set times on \"/media/storage/photos/2014/2014-01-12\": Operation not permitted (1)\nrsync: failed to set permissions on \"/media/storage/photos/2014/2014-01-12/20140112-0001.nef\": Operation not permitted (1)`\n\nand about 1000 more files with the same error in various subfolders in the 2014 folder, all from the same time of the year.\nThe cron output ended like this:\nsent 4.88M bytes  received 189.17K bytes  41.42K bytes/sec\ntotal size is 900.38G  speedup is 177,466.40\nrsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1183) [sender=3.1.0]\n\nWhen listing the contents of the photos folder, the 2014 folder and its contents have a different owner and different rights: \ndrwxr-xr-x 24 zarkov users   4096 jan 12  2014 2013/\ndrwxrwxrwx 23   1001   1001  4096 aug  3 19:43 2014/\ndrwxr-xr-x 16 zarkov zarkov  4096 jul 28 12:36 2015/\nzarkov@server:/media/storage/photos/2014$ ll\ntotal 108\ndrwxrwxrwx 23   1001   1001  4096 aug  3 19:43 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 18 zarkov  users  4096 jul  7 20:14 ../\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 sep 26 15:29 2014-01-12/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-12/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-13/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-14/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001 12288 maj  3  2014 2014-04-15/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-16/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 sep 26 00:23 2014-04-17/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 sep 26 00:24 2014-04-18/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-19/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-20/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 sep 26 00:25 2014-04-21/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-22/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-23/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-26/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-28/\ndrwxrwxrwx  2   1001   1001  4096 maj  3  2014 2014-04-29/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 zarkov zarkov  4096 sep 18  2014 2014-08-27/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 zarkov zarkov  4096 sep 18  2014 2014-09-18/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 zarkov zarkov  4096 okt 26  2014 2014-10-24/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 zarkov zarkov 12288 okt 26  2014 2014-10-25/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 zarkov zarkov  4096 okt 26  2014 2014-10-26/\n\nMy /etc/fstab looks like this:\n# windows share\n//windows/photos  /media/w7photo   cifs    guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8   0       0\n\nDo I need to add anything to the fstab or rsync options to make things run more smoothly next time?

I am currently running Ubuntu Unity 14.04.x and Zorin OS 9 (14.04.x based distro).  Both OSs are running Nautilus 3.10.1.  Recently, Nautilus 3.18.1 was released.  This new version is not in the Software Center for upgrading.  And, it appears that Nautilus is not being supported for updates/upgrades when new releases are made.

So, how do I manually upgrading Nautilus?  And, will Nautilus updates/upgrades every be supported?  \n\nA: You can't. Nautilus 3.18 isn't available for Ubuntu 14.04. Ubuntu 14.04 is too old, or the required libraries are too old. You could try it for yourself to compile. But you will not succeed. To use Nautilus 3.18 you need at least Ubuntu 15.10 with some additionally PPAs or wait for Ubuntu 16.04.\n", "Q: MATE system settings I have Ubuntu 15.04 and using MATE.\nI am unable to find the tool for settings system preferences.\nAnybody know what to do about this?\n\nA: Answer in Progress..\nkeep mouse pointer at top left,\n\n", "Q: How to create an desktop application that appear in the top menu bar?

When I start my editor of choice (sublime text, but this is true for any program) from the command line everything works fine. When I start it from the desktop (gnome 3 in this case), the variables are missing.\nSo my question is: What is the correct way to define variables that are honored by the desktop and the terminal alike? \n\nA: The variables in your .bashrc are only set up by a bash shell, which, if the variables are exported, stores the vars and their values in its environment, and passes a copy this environment to any process it starts. Starting sublime text from the desktop does not invoke bash to read .bashrc. You could set the variables globally by defining (and exporting) them in a user.sh file in /etc/profile.d (you will have to create /etc/profile.d/user.sh). If you are on a multi-user system, you could surround the definitions with if [[ \"$USER\" = \"me\" ]] ; then ... fi, so that everybody else (if that's a non-empty set) doesn't suffer with your definitions. Look at the other scripts in /etc/profile.d for hints.   \nTo see process relationships, and environment inheritance, one could  \npstree -a -c -l -p -u 1\n\nand, of course, man pstree.\n", "Q: Wireless card not detected on Dell XPS 13 Just got a dell XPS 13 which was preinstalled window 10.

Thank you, Richard Volta\n\nA: As Zachree1 also said there is no run in linux. What you need is ./.  In linux, if you want to execute a file you make it have executable permission and put ./ before it to run. In your case you will have to do \nFirst make it executable\nsudo chmod a+x /opt/COMODO/post+setup.sh\n\nThen run it\ncd /opt/COMODO/\n./post+setup.sh\n\nPut a sudo  in front of command if it says Operation not permitted or Permission Denied.\nAfter that, since cmdavd is inside /etc you will require sudo permissions, so command would be,\nsudo /etc/init.d/cmdavd restart\n\nHope that clears it up\n\nA: To run something in the terminal you just type it in. In your case: /opt/COMODO/post-setup.sh and then /etc/init.d/cmdavd restart.

The remote machine has no monitor attached. I have Teamviewer10 on both machines.\nThe problem is that with no monitor attached, the remote desktop has only 1024x768 resolution. xrandr shows LVDS1 to be connected, although it isn't, and it only allows 1024x768 resolution. \nThe solution appears to entail using xrandr to test resolution, and then inserting the xrandr commands somewhere to execute the commands on startup/login, and make the change permanent.  It is also possible that I need to create  /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and set up a dummy monitor.  I really do not understand the steps entailed in that, and many Googlees say it does not work anyway. Some say I need a hardware dongle (I really cannot believe that you need hardware to do something like this - it must be a common requirement to use a machine without a monitor).\nI would be very grateful if somebody could tell me if I am on the right track and make these ideas more concrete.  I do not really want to hear about solutions using other remote viewing software (vnc etc).

What I'm trying to do\nI'm trying to use GParted on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS to clone a partition from one device to a newer device (three devices are in play total if you include the one I'm working from). I'm fine using the terminal but haven't gotten the commands correct. The newer device has more space than this one partition I'm going to clone over, and I created an msdos partition table, so all I need to do is create a new partition as ntfs.\nThe Issue\nGParted (the version in the repo: 0.18.0) isn't recognizing the ssd as a block device.\n\nI attempted sudo mkntfs -Q -v -L -F \"win7\" /dev/sdb1 which is what uis said plus -F for force, but it spit back Cannot understand the number of sectors '/dev/sdb1'. I'm not very comfortable doing disk partitioning commands in the CLI without expert help, and I wasn't sure forcing it was right anyway.\nInfo / Research\nOther questions\nThis question talks about all major methods of formatting a drive. That seems like a lead, but after reading through the documentation, the main thing I came upon was that I might be able to use -F to force the writing to the non-block device, but I'm not sure that would go as expected because from what I understand, the new SSD is actually a block device.\ndisk layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda: This is of little importance for the question except that it's my mainstay SSD drive where I'm doing all this from.\n\n*/dev/sdb: New SSD; empty with msdos partition table. This is where I want the new ntfs partition spanning the whole drive so that I can later use sudo ntfsclone -f --rescue --overwrite /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 to clone my old ntfs partition to this new one. Of potential note, this is temporarily plugged into the SATA cable that my DVD drive used. I'm pretty sure that just means it's a slower speed but is the same thing, but I could be mistaken. When I'm done, I'm switching SATA ports, but I'm comfortable with that part, with BIOs, and with GRUB refreshing, so I don't anticipate further issues at that point. Also, the other partitions aren't being backed up, so they don't need to be considered.\n\n*/dev/sdc: This is my older disc-based hard drive. It isn't very fast, and the ntfs partition is pretty full. I need to make a bigger one on a faster drive and then decommission this.\n\n\nfdisk output:\ndan@dan-box:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 256.1 GB, 256060514304 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 31130 cylinders, total 500118192 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0007d2fd\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   483571711   241784832   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       483573758   500117503     8271873    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       483573760   500117503     8271872   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders, total 234441648 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000d9497\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000b8aef\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *        2048   184322047    92160000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdc2       184322048   245762047    30720000   83  Linux\n/dev/sdc3       245764094  1953523711   853879809    5  Extended\n/dev/sdc5       245764096   261386239     7811072   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sdc6       261388288  1953523711   846067712   83  Linux\n\nls -l /dev/sdb? \nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 17 Sep 28 07:15 /dev/sdb1\n\napt-cache policy ntfs-3g\ndan@dan-box:~$ sudo apt-cache policy ntfs-3g\n[sudo] password for dan: \nntfs-3g:\n  Installed: 1:2013.1.13AR.1-2ubuntu2\n  Candidate: 1:2013.1.13AR.1-2ubuntu2\n  Version table:\n *** 1:2013.1.13AR.1-2ubuntu2 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nSolution\nThe accepted answer below was my solution: I formatted as EXT4.

I removed everything on my MacBook Pro, partitioned it into several small partitions, and installed Ubuntu, Windows and OS X. Grub2 sees my Windows and Ubuntu installs, but OS X doesn't show up in the Grub2 menu.\nI tried os-prober and it doesn't find anything. I tried the various edits to 40_custom I've seen here and here and elsewhere, but I keep getting \"hd0,[blank]\" does not exist.\nHow can I make OS X show up on the Grub2 menu at boot?\n\nA: An EFI-mode GRUB should be able to chainload the OS X boot loader, but the GRUB prober might not know where to find it. It's traditionally stored as /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi on the OS X root partition; but since Yosemite, it's typically stored on the emergency-boot disk instead, since the root filesystem now uses an LVM setup by default, which the firmware can't read. In any event, you may need to write a custom GRUB entry to get this to boot. See here for some basic information, although that doesn't give complete instructions for what you want.\nIf your Ubuntu installation is in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, it may be harder, since GRUB can't redirect to an EFI-mode boot. GRUB has the ability to boot the OS X kernel directly, but that can be tricky to set up and may lose you some features in OS X. This is definitely fringe/bleeding-edge stuff, so I don't recommend you try it. If you care to do so, you can probably find instructions somewhere on the Internet, but I don't have any URLs handy.\nMany Mac users prefer to use something other than GRUB as the default boot loader, relegating GRUB to secondary status or not using it at all. The traditional tool for doing this is rEFIt, but it's been abandoned for five years now. It still works, but if you use Yosemite or some other relatively recent options, you may have to jump through some extra hoops. I created a fork of rEFIt called rEFInd. It's actively maintained and will boot any of your OSes. You can try it out on a CD-R or USB flash drive before installing it to your hard disk, if you like. (The downloads page includes links to images for both types of media. rEFInd can boot Linux kernels directly, thus bypassing GRUB; or it can chainload to either an EFI-mode or a BIOS-mode GRUB. It can also chainload to the OS X boot loader and to both EFI-mode and BIOS-mode Windows boot loaders.\n\nA: I have installed Debian without rEFInd. I had difficulty booting OSX from GRUB. I had to press the Alt button to boot into MacOs.\nI tried several entries into the 40_custom file but no avail.

Sometimes it helps to restart the app but not always. Does someone know what is causing this? Any Ideas for fixes?\nThank you!\n\nA: It's related to this bug with critical status, should be fixed by OTA 7: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-app-launch/+bug/1478853\n", "Q: how to set IP Address manual with command line(not GUI) but the network connection through WLAN (WiFi) I have configured the interfaces file in the directory /etc/network\n # DHCP not needed\n # iface wlan2 inet dhcp\n      auto wlan2\n      iface wlan2 inet static\n      address 192.168.23.11\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      gateway 192.168.23.1\n      dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nthe resolv.conf file in the directory /etc/ i add its dns-server\n   # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n   # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\n     nameserver 8.8.8.8\n     search mynetwork.local\n\nthe hosts file in the directory /etc/ i add ip manuals\n   192.168.23.11     Yudi\n\nafter I configure it all, I tried to restart the IP configuration with the command\n$ sudo ifdown lo && sudo ifup lo\n\nbut the configuration is not successful, I also have to restart the laptop but also to no avail..\nwhat's the solution?\n\nA: With your command you did only restart the loopback interface, not the interface you edited.\nUsually you stop the network interface you want to edit (wlan2 in your case) with ifdown, before you edit the /etc/network/interfaces file and bring it up with ifup afterwards.\nTry executing ifup wlan2. Make sure there is no network manager installed trying to configure the wifi itself and make sure wlan2 is the correct interface.\n\nA: Setting up static IP address can be done through /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file by adding this at the end of the file:\ninterface \"wlan2\" {\n    send dhcp-requested-address 192.168.23.11;\n}\n\nThis is a compromise between using a static IP yet using DHCP.  Your dhcp client will send request to the dhcp server for that specific address whenever you connect to a router. The other parts, such as dns-nameserver can be configured in the middle of the file, by adding line supersede domain-name-serves xxx.xxx.xxx.xx. For example, here is part of my file:\n#send host-name \"andare.fugue.com\";\nsend host-name = gethostname();\n#send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;\n#send dhcp-lease-time 3600;\n#supersede domain-name \"fugue.com home.vix.com\";\nsupersede domain-name-servers 208.67.220.220; # THIS LINE HERE\n#prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\nrequest subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n    domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n    dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,\n    netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n    rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers,\n    dhcp6.fqdn, dhcp6.sntp-servers;\n\nThe netmask and gateway can be left to be configured automatically. All editing can be done with command line text editors such as nano and vi or even batch editors like sed or awk\n", "Q: Deleting duplicate lines in text file.....? How can I delete duplicate lines in a text file via command prompt?\nFor Example:\nI have a 10MB text file and I want to keep only one line of My line, but somewhere in the text file there are 2 My lines.\n\nA: There are multiple ways to do this. If ordering is not important then, sort and uniq are easiest to remember. \nHowever if you want to maintain ordering of the text file yet delete duplicates then awk does the trick. You can also use sed I believe. \nHere is an example \n/tmp/debugSys>cat fileWithDupText.txt \nline2\nline21\nline2\nline1\nline2\n/tmp/debugSys>\n\n/tmp/debugSys>cat fileWithDupText.txt | awk '!a[$0]++' \nline2\nline21\nline1\n/tmp/debugSys>sort fileWithDupText.txt | uniq\nline1\nline2\nline21\n/tmp/debugSys>sort -u fileWithDupText.txt \nline1\nline2\nline21\n/tmp/debugSys>\n\n\nA: Found a nice Perl one-liner for that, using md5 hashes ;), but this is slow and only worth it if you have very long lines and a huge file where it will greatly reduce memory use:\nperl -MDigest::MD5 -ne '$seen{Digest::MD5::md5($_)}++ or print' foo\n\nTherefore simply use\nperl -ne '$seen{$_}++ or print' foo\n\nSource\n\nExample\ncat foo\nfoo\nfii\nfoo bar\nfoobar\nfoobar\nfoo\n\nperl -ne '$seen{$_}++ or print' foo\nfoo\nfii\nfoo bar\nfoobar\n\n\nA: Using awk\nawk '!x[$0]++' infile.txt > outfile.txt\n\nthe way it works is that it keeps count of the lines in an array, and if the current count is zero, ie the first occurance, it prints the line, otherwise it continues to the next one.\n", "Q: “You are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run: libc.so.6” Standard fixes not working Recently set myself up with 14.04 LTS and when I install steam and try to run it, I get this message in terminal.\nSteam needs to install these additional packages:\nlibgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, libc6:i386\n\nWhen I enter my password for this, I get this series of events in terminal:\nReading package lists...

Searching on the dash, I can see the program listed as \"Personal File Sharing\". How can I find the executable name of this program such that it can be launched in a terminal?\n\nA: Open terminal and use grep to search for \"personal file sharing\" in /usr/share/applications folder.\nIn fact, you will have this output:\n$ grep -R -i \"personal file sharing\" /usr/share/applications\n/usr/share/applications/gnome-user-share-properties.desktop:Name=Personal File Sharing\n\nNow, if we do this:\n$ grep \"Exec\" /usr/share/applications/gnome-user-share-properties.desktop\nExec=gnome-file-share-properties\n\nThat the actual program that runs is `gnome-file-share-properties, which is located at\n$ which gnome-file-share-properties\n/usr/bin/gnome-file-share-properties\n\nTo be more specific, what happens is that in linux there are .desktop files.

The folder \"file\" cannot be copied because you\n  do not have permissions to create it in the destination.\n\nHow can I copy a folder from one directory to another directory ?\nThanks\n\nA: By default Ubuntu file manager doesn't have an option to open folders with elevated permissions; you need nautilus-admin plugin for that.\nOpen Software Center and search for nautilus-admin package. Install it. Once the plug in has been added, stop file manager (the command for that is nautilus -q) and restart it. \nNow, you can copy and paste files in file manager with Admin permissions , if you right-click on body of the folder and select \"Open as Administrator\".\nHowever, if the folder where you try to copy the file has permissions other than root user, for example userA:userA , you will have to use command line to add yourself to userA group (considering that you have sudo privileges). There is no GUI way to do that!\n\nA: Alternatively, open Terminal and type: sudo nautilus & \nThat will open Nautilus as the superuser. You can copy anything anywhere you want, and it doesn't require installing anything.\n\nA: move it with terminal as admin eg\nsudo mv campfund /location/\n", "Q: installing VHDL on ubuntu 15.04 I want to learn VHDL for noc simulation (specifically noc router and buffer micro-architecture).

Add a local copy of the library with my app, or use the system library add dependencies to the final package, etc.?\n\n*Do I have to develop my app with the QML layer? or can I use pure C++?\n\n*For the instance I don't like at all ubuntu-sdk (I don't like IDEs too much) is it possible to develop in my own to therefore upload the app to Ubuntu store?\nThanks, and sorry if some of my questions has no sense, It's first time I try to develop to phones platforms  and I feel a little bit lost.\n\nA: *\n\n*I don't see qxmpp in the what is called 'framework' (it's a ubuntu-sdk-libs package). There are no xmpp packages installed on the phone. So, it's probably a bundled copy.\nThe read-only part of the software on the phone is called 'OS image'. It's updated over the air as a whole. It consists of .deb packages as a desktop Ubuntu. So, direct approach is to chroot into an image and look with dpkg -l what packages are installed. Or do dpkg -l on the phone or the emulator. Doc says that earlier (13.10) the libs available were listed in the dependencies of the virtual package ubuntu-sdk-libs: http://packages.ubuntu.com/vivid/ubuntu-sdk-libs . But now it may be more useful to search in the list of all packages.\n\n*You don't have to use the QML layer. You can even use Qt Widgets. But believe me, QML is great. It doesn't want to harm C++ in any way.\n\n*Yes, you can develop without SDK. Ubuntu-Touch application is just a regular application compiled for ARM (it even runs on desktop if qemu-user-static package is installed). Only the last step wraps it into a Click package.\nIt's built with CMake, so that will be compatible with other editors. I've got an example of build files here. Usual compile and a small boilerplate inside CMakeLists.txt to invoke the Click packager.\nYou'll probably use SDK to generate the chroots. Then the code will be compiled in these chroots and the emulators can be run in them (outside of SDK).\n", "Q: Xubuntu - shortcut for magnifying screen I started using Xubuntu a few weeks ago, and I'm annoyed with a strange behaviour : when I accidentally type a certain keyboard shortcut (yet to be determined), my screen shifts to a \"magnified\" mode (it gets a 10% zoom and starts to move the opposite way of my mouse pointer).\nI'd like to know the shortcut (so I can at least leave this mode without disconnecting my session everytime...) and if possible, how to disable this completely.

The namelist file is needed\n      for a proper WCHAN display, and must match the current Linux\n      kernel exactly for correct output.  Without this option, the\n      default search path for the namelist is:\n\n              $PS_SYSMAP\n              $PS_SYSTEM_MAP\n              /proc/*/wchan\n              /boot/System.map-$(uname -r)\n              /boot/System.map\n              /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/System.map\n              /usr/src/linux/System.map\n              /System.map\n\nYou can inspect /boot/System.map-$(uname -r) on Ubuntu for a list of functions:\n$ sudo head /boot/System.map-$(uname -r)\n0000000000000000 D __per_cpu_start\n0000000000000000 D irq_stack_union\n0000000000000000 A xen_irq_disable_direct_reloc\n0000000000000000 A xen_save_fl_direct_reloc\n00000000000001e0 A kexec_control_code_size\n0000000000004000 d exception_stacks\n0000000000009000 D gdt_page\n000000000000a000 D espfix_waddr\n000000000000a008 D espfix_stack\n000000000000a020 D cpu_info\n\n\nA: Note that this answer is mostly obsolete: you should never need a namelist or System.map anymore. ps in procps-ng reads /proc/${pid}/wchan directly, instead of reading the 30th field (wchan) out of /proc/${pid}/stat and decoding it against a symbol map file.\nIn fact, some kernels may set the wchan field of /proc/${pid}/stat to 1 instead of a real value in order to hide the details of kernel address space layout randomization.\n(I'm hitting some odd issues with wchan on Fedora 32 though, see fedora bug 1879450).\n", "Q: lost my files after mounting a partition as home folder I made a bad mistake .

You will have to delete kernel the 3.16 series kernel for things to fall back to working by default.\nFirst, make sure that you can easily get to grub during boot time, so that you can select which kernel you want the system to boot with. As sudo edit /etc/default/grub, and set a long enough timeout to ensure that you have time to access it during boot. Perhaps save a copy of the original file first. I use these settings:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=20 \n\nAfter the edit do:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow, re-boot. During re-boot access the Advanced Options for Ubuntu line to open the secondary menu. From the list of kernels select the most recent 3.13 numbered kernel.\nOnce booted, proceed to deleting kernel 3.16.0-031600rc4-generic. For the RC kernels, typically this would be 3 packages. To confirm:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-\n\nthen (I think):\nsudo dpkg -r linux-headers-3.16.0-031600rc4-generic\nsudo dpkg -r linux-headers-3.16.0-031600rc4\nsudo dpkg -P linux-image-3.16.0-031600rc4-generic\n\nNote: I always purge the kernel image.\nre-boot, and let the grub timeout expire without doing anything. i.e. do a default boot. Do you know have a 3.13 series kernel? Now, you can go back to whatever grub timeouts, or lack thereof, you prefer.\n\nA: There are for major stable versions for Ubuntu 14.04.\nThey are: 3.13, 3.16, 3.19 and 4.4\nYou can install either of them by running:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nfor 3.13\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic\n\nfor 3.16\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid\n\nfor 3.19\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\nYou can have all these kernels installed, and they will get updates.\nYou need to know that the system always boot with the latest kernel by default. If you install 3.19 kernel, Ubuntu will boot with it no matter which 3.13 and 3.16 kernel images are installed.\nYou can always remove unneeded kernel images and headers using Synaptic.\nUpdate: Now only 3.13 and 4.4 are supported and get updates.\n", "Q: Giving a Hard Drive Executable permissions for Steam I am completely new to Linux, installed it around 10 mins ago any my first order of business is to get my HDD working. I have it set up and plugged in or whatever and there is alot of files on it that I can't lose, so reformatting or whatever isn't an option. I need to give it executable permissions so I can run the steam games off of it. How do I do this? I've browsed around other threads and looked at the stuff but some of it seems really complicated to a complete linux noob like myself. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This error seems to be related to the permissions of the folder your disk is mounted to, for me it was mounted by the user AFTER log in, by changing it to log in at boot (moving the mount point to /mnt from /media), it was mounted as root and the error was gone.\nOpen the dash and find the disks app, open it, click on the hard drive with your games on it and then, on the right the little cogs and mount options and make it look like this\n\nNow just open steam and then, from the drop down menus, go to >> Steam >> Settings, choose downloads on the left then click STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS button.\n\nYou should see a box listing only your steam install directory, click ADD NEW LIBRARY FOLDER and point it to the location of your folder.\nNow your new drive is added and it will look, something like, this\n\nNow your Steam should ask you where you installed games at the time of installation.\n\nA: Reading a bit the comments, you have a disk used by Windows, probably formatted in NTFS, so its partitioning DO NOT ALLOW Unix permissions to be set.\nYou have to emulate them when you mount it.\nFollow the first part of this answer to know how.\nMoreover, if you want to make it always mounted with exec permissions, you have to modify your fstab.\nFor this, I refer you to the official community page.\n\nA: You can grant executable permissions using chmod. However granting executable permission to a whole harddisk is not at all recommended and WILL break your linux installation. What you wan't to do is run games i understand, and believe me you DON'T need to give executable permissions to a whole drive to do just that. Now, lets get to what you need to do to run your games.\nFirst make sure are they windows game(ones which have a setup and are run by .exe file) or linux native games. Running a game native to linux will be very simple. You will most probably just need to extract it and run is main file by double clicking. Running a game you used to play on windows will require wine. You can find how to setup wine and run windows games here. Also not all windows games run smoothly in linux, check your game compatiblity here. Hope that clears it up, goodluck.\n", "Q: Why is `service x11-common stop` timing out?

I cannot figure out how to execute a macro in libreoffice impress.  I went to tools - advanced - enable macros, restarted the program and I still don't have any new options.  I am trying to execute a macro in a .bas file but when I go to run macro I can't find a way to execute the file saved to my home. There is nothing in the libreoffice documentation about executing a .bas file.\n\nA: AFAIK, you can't execute a macro directly from a .bas source file. Instead, you need to create a new library or a new module in an existing library, and copy/paste the Basic code into that new module.\nGenerally, there's a per-user macro repository and a system-wide repository. Additionally, you can put macros directly into LO Impress / Writer / Calc files, but they will only be available if that file is currently loaded.\nSo, the exact solution depends on the scope of your macro - do you use it only together with a certain impress file, or should other users use it, too?\nFor more Information regarding how to organize macros in LO, see the LO Wiki.\nAssuming you need it only combined with a certain impress file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open that impress file in LO; open the .bas file in a text editor;\n\n*In Impress: Menu Tools -> Macros -> Organize Macros -> LibreOffice Basic;\n\n*In the Macro from window, select your impress file; hit New; enter a module name;\n\n*Now, the LO Basic IDE opens, with a Sub Main - End Sub macro stub.\n\n*Copy the basic code from the .bas file, and paste it into the LO Basic IDE.\n\n\nThat's it. Now, you can start editing / debugging the macro code using the LO Basic IDE. Saving your Impress document will save the macro code, too. You can run the macro from Menu Tools -> Macros -> Run Macro -> Select your Impress file, Library (\"Standard\") and Module - select Main -> hit Run.\n", "Q: How can I change Maximum segment lifetime in Ubuntu 14.04 How can I change maximum segment lifetime in Ubuntu 14.04?\nthere is no net.inet.tcp.msl there\nThe problem is that I need my TCPsockets to live more than 240 seconds..\n\nA: The Maximum Segment Lifetime value is used to determine the TIME_WAIT interval (2*MSL)\nTry to check this value with commands below:\nsysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout\ncat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout\n\nedit /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout\nand change default value.

This mask shall affect the initial\n       value of the file permission bits of  subsequently  created  files.\n\nWhat this means, is that when a file is created, it starts off assuming its permission wil be 777, rwxwrxwrx, Read, Write and Execute access for Owner, Group and World. But then, the \"mode bits\" (another name for \"permission  bits\", but shorter) are ANDed with the COMPLIMENT of the umask value. If one sets umask 022 (in ~/.bashrc, or in the current shell, to affect that shell) then the operation is:  \n 777    Original mode bits  0B111111111\n 755    Compliment of 022   0B111101101\n-----   AND     \n 755    The result, rwxr-xr-x (Read, Write, Execute for Owner, Read, Execute for Group and World  \n\nAnother common umask value is 027 (NO access for World).  \nThis is a tricky idea, and deserves understanding.

Once the server was reinstalled, I installed mysql and phpmyadmin. Afterwards, I tried to put my database files back into the new server. All tables came over fine, but when I transferred the user table in the mysql database, I started getting errors, then I couldn't use the \"service mysql reload\" command because the server didn't recognize any password.

I had this VMware ESXi server which included a VM with my issue tracking data (Jira).

For  example,\n       the command\n\n              mount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop\n\n       will  set  up  the  loop  device  /dev/loop3  to correspond to the file\n       /tmp/disk.img, and then mount this device on /mnt.\n\nHowever, in spite of what the man page says, I suggest you mount your disk image someplace other  than /mnt.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on D:\\ drive partition as Dual-boot with windows 7 on a SSD C:\\ drive Im not familiar with Ubuntu or Linux in general but have succesfully installed dual-boot windows7/Ubuntu on a single harddisk on my private PC. I used the \"Install Ubuntu alongside them\"-option. \nOn my work PC I have an existing windows 7 64-bit installation that boots from BIOS firmware on a SSD drive (C:), and have my working data (documents etc) on a partition on a separate disk (D:).\nI now want to install Ubuntu (v 14.04.3) on the remaining unformatted space on D:\\ using with the option of choosing system using GRUB. There are of cause fine descriptions around (e.g. here and here).\nMy question is how to setup the partitions in the \"something else\"- option during the Ubuntu installation. \nIn this tutorial they assume that all partitions on the D-drive can be deleted; however I only obviously want to keep the working data on the existing D-partition, and place Ubuntu on the residual space (or part of it) on the D:-drive.\nA) How is this ensured ?\nB) how many partitions should I make (boot, root, home, swap ?) \nC) and should boot be made primary, and the others logical ?\nD) Should I set Device for boot loader installation as/dev/sdb - will this not erase the existing D-partion ? \n\nA: You can choose \"something else\", then create partitions for Ubuntu on your HDD.\nIf you do not delete any Windows partitions, then all data will be there.\nStandard installation of Ubuntu needs 2 partitions. One for the system / and the other is swap. Swap in most cases is OK to be the RAM size.\nYou can search other answers regarding the optimal swap size.\nMany people recoomend to create a separate /home partition. In this case you create one / partition 15-25 GB and the rest allocate for /home.\nMy opinion is that there is no need for a separare /home nowadays.\nAnd I am sure that it is not good to create a separate /root or /boot for a desktop system if there is no special reason for that.  \n", "Q: Problems with running sqlplus64 == SP2-1502: The HTTP proxy server specified by http_proxy is not accessible Running Ubuntu 14.10\nI installed the Oracle Client version 11_2 but when I try to run sqlplus64I get:\nError 46 initializing SQL*Plus\nHTTP proxy setting has incorrect value\nSP2-1502: The HTTP proxy server specified by http_proxy is not accessible**\n\nORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_2/files\n\nORACLE_SID=$ORACLE_HOME\n\nAnother peculiar thing.

This complicates things.  We can't easily resize a Wubi installation.  A Wubi installation is not a true dual-boot.  It's a single container file installed in Windows that takes up Windows filesystem space.  You then have it 'booting' into that container, and it is not a true dualboot.\nResizing in the way you look to be trying to achieve may not work correctly, if at all.\nI advise you take the data inside your Wubi installation and copy it to an external drive, then do an actual dual boot installation, while removing the Wubi installation.\n\nA: \nWARNING\nPartitioning always holds a risk of data loss. Moving the left borders of partitions may lead to boot failure. Especially as you did a Wubi installation I can't predict how it will react.\nMAKE A BACKUP BEFORE PROCEEDING!\n\n\nFirst, you need to boot from a live system, e.g. your Ubuntu installation medium. From there, start GParted.\nYou can not ⁽*⁾ resize mounted partitions, so right-click on all partitions in GParted's list that show the grey lock symbol behind the first column and unmount them.\nAfter that, enlarge the Extended Partition /dev/sda4 by moving its left border to occupy all unallocated space. If you don't understand why, read my very metaphorical and easy explanation here, please.\nNow there is unallocated space inside the extended partition, which we can now attach to your Ubuntu partition /dev/sda5. Move its left border to the beginning of the extended partition.\nTell GParted to apply the changes by clicking the green tick symbol.\nNow all unpartitioned space should be covered. Task done, reboot and pray that you don't need your backup.\n(*) Some file systems allow enlarging the partition to the right without unmounting, but shrinking or enlarging a partition to the left is never possible while mounted.\n", "Q: Error while installing Oracle JDK 8 in Ubuntu 15.04 These commands both run successfully \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\n\nBut when I run sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer, it downloads the  JDK but then stops showing the following error:\ndpkg: error processing package oracle-java8-installer (--configure):\n  subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1 \nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: Open terminal and run the following commands,\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/info/\\*.\\*` \nsudo apt-get clean`\nsudo apt-get install -f`\nsudo apt-get update` \n\n", "Q: ufw allow port from ip address range and deny others I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nroot@alexus:~# ufw status verbose\nStatus: active\nLogging: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)\nNew profiles: skip\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere\n2376/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere\n22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)\n2376/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)\n\nroot@alexus:~# \n\nI used following rule to allow communication from specific IP to port 9150:\nroot@alexus:~# ufw allow proto tcp from Y.Y.Y.Y to any port 9150\nRule added\nroot@alexus:~#\n\nhowever, from a remote host I'm able to connect to port 9150:\n[alexus@wcmisdlin02 Desktop]$ nmap -v X.X.X.X -p 9150 -P0\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-28 10:45 EDT\nInitiating Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 10:45\nCompleted Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 10:45, 0.10s elapsed\nInitiating Connect Scan at 10:45\nScanning X.X.X.X [1 port]\nDiscovered open port 9150/tcp on X.X.X.X\nCompleted Connect Scan at 10:45, 0.11s elapsed (1 total ports)\nNmap scan report for X.X.X.X\nHost is up (0.11s latency).\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\n9150/tcp open  unknown\n\nRead data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.23 seconds\n[alexus@wcmisdlin02 Desktop]$ \n\nHow do I configure ufw to allow connection to port 9150 from specific IP address/range only and not from others?\n* UPDATE *\nroot@alexus:~# ufw status verbose\nStatus: active\nLogging: on (low)\nDefault: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)\nNew profiles: skip\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\n22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere\n2376/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere\n9150/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Y.Y.Y.Y\n9150/tcp                   DENY IN     Anywhere\n22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)\n2376/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)\n9150/tcp (v6)              DENY IN     Anywhere (v6)\n\nroot@alexus:~# \n\n\nA: after I remove following rule:\n\n22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)\n\nufw starts to netfilter.\n", "Q: How can I find world writable files and folders and set the sticky bit?

In Ubuntu 12.04, I used to changed keyboard layout just by pressing Left Alt. After upgrading to 14.04, it is not possible anymore. \nIt is very annoying, to the extent that I'm tempted to downgrade Ubuntu because I need to switch layout frequently and not comfortable with any combination. So I really appreciate your help.  \n\nA: Open the file /etc/default/keyboard. You should see there a line that starts with XKBOPTIONS word, for reference here's mine:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:rctrl_rshift_toggle,grp_led:scroll,lv3:ralt_switch,compose:rwin\"\n\nInside the quotes is a list of options separated by comma. Layout switching option looks like grp:the_key_you_want, list of options is described in man xkeyboard-config. To make layout switching with the Left Alt just add the option (or change if you have one) grp:lalt_toggle. E.g. with my config:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:lalt_toggle,grp_led:scroll,lv3:ralt_switch,compose:rwin\"\n\nThen just reboot (perhaps log-out would be enough, but I am not sure).\nBut I actually think that somewhere in graphical keyboard configuration you should find a way to change the key. I am using AwesomeWM in Kubuntu, so I can't provide the exact way, but I encourage you to search it.\nUPD: from the discussion with the author it was found that /etc/default/keyboard file doesn't work the way it should.

Now I need to install Ubuntu 15.04 alongside Windows. I have done this before with my other laptops. However, now when i try to install Ubuntu, first during the installation it gives me a warning as; \n\nForce UEFI Installation?     This machines's  firmware has started\n  this installer in UEFI mode but it looks like there maybe existing\n  operating systems already installed using BIOS compatibility mode, If\n  you continue to install Debian in UEFI mode,it might be difficult to\n  reboot into any BIOS-mode operating system.\n\nAlso note that I'm not getting the \"Install alongside Windows\" option. Instead, I see;\n\nThis computer currently has detected no operating systems.\n\nEven though I have Windows 10 installed.\nHow can i install Ubuntu alongside Windows?\n\nA: It's almost always best to boot all your OSes in the same mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI). Most computers with Windows 8 and later pre-installed use EFI mode for this, but a small mom-and-pop computer store might still use BIOS mode. It sounds like this may be what you've got.\nIn this case, the question is how to get the Ubuntu installer to boot in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode. Unfortunately, the answer varies from one system to another. Typically, you can access the computer's built-in boot manager by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key as it starts up. With any luck, you'll be able to find this easily, and you'll see two options for your boot medium, one with the string \"UEFI\" and one without it. Select the option that lacks the \"UEFI\" string and the installer should boot in BIOS mode.\nIf you can find the boot manager but you don't see a non-UEFI boot option, or if that boot option gets you to the same complaint you're seeing, you can try a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the boot medium in some other way. Some tools omit one boot loader or the other, so a BIOS-mode boot might fail and possibly fall back to an EFI-mode boot. Some tools (notably Rufus) offer options about what boot loaders to include. If you see such options, be sure to pick the ones for the most traditional BIOS-mode features, including the BIOS-mode boot loader and MBR partition table.\n\n*Use another USB flash drive. Some drives simply refuse to boot on some computers in BIOS mode. I don't know why this is, but I've seen it on some combinations. Switching from a USB flash drive to a DVD-R is also an option, if your computer has a DVD drive.\n\n\nAs to the lack of the \"install alongside\" option, this might be a consequence of booting in EFI mode -- this option is usually absent when booted in this way. The solution is to use the \"Something Else\" option. Note that if you boot in BIOS mode, you may see this option appear. OTOH, it could be you've got a damaged or flaky partition table, or one with leftover GPT data. Some such problems can be fixed with the fixparts tool, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. See this page of mine and the FixParts documentation for more on this subject. (Note that I'm the author of fixparts.)\nOh, one more thing: Be sure to disable the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature, which turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations. This can cause disk corruption, and could be another reason you're not seeing the \"install alongside\" option.\n\nA: The question you refer to says to answer with either OK or Cancel depending on if you want to proceed with the UEFI install, or switch to BIOS mode.  Choose the one to switch to BIOS Mode ( I believe it was cancel ).\n", "Q: How to get name of local repository (for use with 'apt-get install -t') I've created a local repository as per BigSack's answer in this thread. I'm using the /var/cache/apt/archives of an old installation of Ubuntu on an external HDD (which I've renamed 'oldhd').\nMy entry in /etc/apt/sources.list looks like this:\n## This is a custom-repository for installing packages from my old HDD\n## HP EliteBook 8460p Ubuntu installation. To install a package\n## specifically from there, use: sudo apt install -t oldhd [package]\ndeb file:/media/me/9c4141dd-b628-439d-b464-0ff988fc849d/var/cache/apt/oldhd ./\n\nEverything seems to work alright. I have the Packages.gz and Sources.gz files in the repository directory. sudo apt update completes without issue. The problem is when I try to install a package from this repository, I get an error:\nme@Alcatraz: sudo apt install -t oldhd [package]\nReading package lists... Done\nE: The value 'oldhd' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such a \nrelease is not available in the sources\n\nThis is the same error I get if I type in nonsense:\nme@Alcatraz: sudo apt install -t kldjflakfsj [package]\nReading package lists... Done\nE: The value 'kldjflakfsj' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such \na release is not available in the sources\n\nThis leads me to assume that apt just isn't seeing oldhd as a repository at all. I think my problem might be along the lines of my neglecting to perform some step to name the repository, but I'm not sure. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Apt sees this as a repository just fine. I believe the problem lies in your repository not containing a Release file (an example: the Release file for trusty-security). Without it, you cannot target that repository using a release specification. You could pin your repository using origin information to give it higher priority (see this answer on U&L).\n", "Q: How to make auto login work in Ubuntu?

This morning I had no Ethernet connectivity after I resumed the computer (showing as Disconnected). I have the latest updates installed, but I've tried booting into older builds via the GRUB menu but still had the same issue with the disconnected ethernet. I also very recently installed VMWare Player (VM is also Ubuntu) but was able to resume with no problems afterwards.\nI had a problem with Network Manager's management of the interfaces before, and so I have blacklisted r8169 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. After doing that, the Ethernet interface worked flawlessly until now (about 2 months). \nIn lspci the device is shown as:\nEthernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. \n RTL8111/8186/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 0c). \n\nIn ifconfig -a, eth0 is not shown at all, only lo, vmnet1 and vmnet8. \nI removed the Ethernet interface that was shown in network manager but it didn't re-populate as I'd hoped (in vain) that it would.

I'm pretty sure that it's because I'd blacklisted the r8169 driver but perhaps it didn't have a fallback. I'd downloaded the r8168 drivers (luckily enough) so I extracted them (tar -xvf r8168-8.00.020.00.tar.bz2) and then compiled them with the autorun.sh. \nMy connectivity did not instantly come back. I had re-added \"blacklist r8169\" in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf already. I re-ran \"lsmod | grep r81*\" and then saw that the r8168 driver was loaded. I restarted networking (sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\" but network manager didn't automatically connect. I noticed that ifconfig was now showing eth0, along with the MAC address. I opened the network manager applet and added a new connection and was able to now select the MAC from the list, and everything was working again, even with network manager. \nHope that helps someone. :)\n", "Q: Why does my kernel fail to build?

After creating a USB Live containing this version of Ubuntu, I booted through Legacy mode and tried Ubuntu so that I can access Gparted.\nWhen I reached gparted, I found three ntfs partitions flagged respectively msftdata, msftdata and diag, one unknown partition flagged msftres and a fat32 partition flagged boot.\nMy aim is to remove them all and create an extended partition that will allow me to set up Ubuntu. However, when I removed the partitions in gparted and tried to create an extended partition I couldn't do so; Gparted was only allowing me to create a primary partition (Logical and Extended were grayed out and thus not selectable).\nBy the way, I found a small warning in the \"partition\" column near to Unknown and ntfs partitions.

I changed the install to a solo install of 14.04 Ubuntu. I get to the log in screen and still not able to log in as user or guest. I did ctrl-alt-f1 and logged in on the shell. I can run commands on the shell. I tried the chmod and chown command lines listed on the duplicate. when i shift back to the log in screen still no luck. I tried the install-session and that didn't work.

I am currently overriding the builtin cd command to source an environment file based on the environment currently being built.\nMy main question pertains to how cd runs when I have shopt -s autocd enabled--relying on autocd to get to the specific directories, my source lines do not get executed. Where can I find out more about how autocd runs cd and why this only works while explicitly calling cd?\nMy .bashrc contains this for the \"auto sourcing\":\ncd() {\n  builtin cd \"$@\"\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/staging' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/staging.env!\";\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/staging.env;\n  fi\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/demo' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/demo.env!\"\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/demo.env;\n  fi\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/prod' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/prod.env!\"\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/prod.env;\n  fi\n\n}\n\nI know this is a bit dangerous and could have unintended consequences, but I can live with that for now. If there's a better solution to automatically sourcing an environment var list when cding into a dir, I'm all ears.\n\nA: I can't find where the internals of autocd are documented, I'm afraid you'll have to check the source code. However, as Glenn points out, if this is not executed when using autocd, then autocd is probably not using cd.\nI can think of two workarounds. First, you can use PROMPT_COMMAND as Glenn suggested. Add this to your .bashrc:\nsourcedir() {\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/staging' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/staging.env!\";\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/staging.env;\n  fi\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/demo' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/demo.env!\"\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/demo.env;\n  fi\n\n  if [[ `pwd` == '/home/ubuntu/deploys/prod' ]]; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ~/.appconfig/prod.env!\"\n    source /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/prod.env;\n  fi\n\n}\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"sourcedir\"\n\nNow, each time you move into these directories, irrespective of how you got there, the files will be sourced. A major drawback of this approach is that the files will be sourced each time a prompt is shown, not only when you first move into the directory. You could avoid this by setting a variable in the sourced file and only sourcing if that variable is not set but this is really getting rather complex. \nI would instead suggest you set up aliases for moving into each of the directories and sourcing the relevant files. Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc (source is actually an alias for . but . is more portable):\nalias staging=\"cd /home/ubuntu/deploys/staging && . /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/staging.env\"\nalias demo=\"cd /home/ubuntu/deploys/demo && . /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/demo.env\"\nalias prod=\"cd /home/ubuntu/deploys/prod && . /home/ubuntu/.appconfig/prod.env\"\n\nNow, you can run staging to move into the staging directory and source the relevant file. The same for each of the other two.  \n", "Q: Start processes to run in parallel I am trying to start 16 python scripts in parallel.\nI tried to do\nfor i in {0..15}\n    do\n    python my_script.py \"$i\"\n    done \n\nBut checking my htop this only runs on one processor.

But when I click on the Install button it sent me to Ubuntu Store (for Ubuntu Phone) and the app is not there. Whats wrong? The App was no created for Ubuntu Phone? Just for other devices?\n\nA: The Ubuntu store is the official appstore for Ubuntu touch. You should download apps from there. The uAppExplorer is an unofficial browser for the apps. You can get information and ratings there.\nAs stated in the FAQ of uAppExplorer:\n\nWhat is this site?\nThis site is an unofficial app browser for Ubuntu Touch apps. All data for \n  the apps comes from a publicly accessible api. This site is maintained by \n  Brian Douglass and is not endorsed by or affiliated with Ubuntu or Canonical. \n  Ubuntu and Canonical are registered trademarks of Canonical Ltd.\nHow do I install apps?\nTo install an app, visit this site on your Ubuntu Touch device.

You will then be taken to the official appstore on your device where you can install the app.\nApps are not installed via this site, but via the official appstore.\n\n\nAnd for the second part of your question:\nYou should be able to find the terminal app by searching for \"Terminal\" in the Ubuntu appstore on your phone.\n", "Q: How to create an alias that will open file in Brackets?

I don't have enough reputation to give more than 2 links in this, but the product number is HDDVIMF8IN and can be found on amazon.com. \nI recently completed my first build, designed around my Apple 30\" Cinema Display. This uses a DVI-D dual-channel cable, and has an optimal resolution of 2560x1600. Specs here. PartPicker Build Part list here.\nI am using \"trusty\": \nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nRelease:        14.04\nCodename:       trusty\n\nMy intention was that the build be able to drive the screen at its optimal resolution of 2560x1600.   I was disappointed that I misread the Motherboard specs, and the DVI-I port only drives 1920x1200 @ 60fps.  Indeed, using the computer with the DVI-I port only gives 1280x800 resolution.   \nHowever, the HDMI ports do drive 2560x1600 @ 60fps.  Subseqently, I purchased a Startech.com HDMI to DVI-D video adaptor, with the intention of plugging this into an HDMI port,so that I can get 2560x1600 resolution.  \nMy problem: I can't get the screen, connected now with the HDMI-to-DVI cable, to give me any better (or, even different) than 1280x800 @60fps resolution.  In this hardware configuration, the hardware doesn't recognize any but the 1280x800 default screen resolution.  I've used cvt and xrandr to define 1920x1600 @45 fps resolution (to be safe) and 2560x1600 @ 60fps resolution, and all I get is the screen goes black. \nExample of what I'm inputting: \nrutledge@sekhmet:~$ cvt 1920 1200\n\\# 1920x1200 44.91 Hz (CVT) hsync: 55.42 kHz; pclk: 141.00 MHz\n>Modeline \"1920x1200_45.00\"  141.00  1920 2032 2232 2544  1200 1203 1209 >1234 -hsync +vsync\n\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1200\" 141.00 1920 2032 2232 2544 1200 1203 1209 >1234 -Hsync +Vsync\n\n>xrandr --addmode HDMI3  “1920x1200”\n\nOutput of xrandr is: \nScreen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1280 x 800, maximum 32767 x 32767\n\nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nHDMI3 connected primary 1280x800+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y >axis) 641mm x 401mm\n\n   1280x800       59.9* \n\n   1920x1200      44.9  \n\nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nI can then set display resolution using \"System Settings...Screen Display\",and the screen goes black. Same thing if I do 1920x1200 @ 60fps or 2560x1600 @ 60 fps.  \nFinally, I should mention that I placed a .conf file into /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d which contains: \nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier \"Configured Video Device\"\n        Option \"AllowDualLinkModes\"\nEndSection\n\nSo, does anyone have any insight as to how I can drive this screen at the desired resolution?  \nPossible sources of the problem which I can still identify: \n\n\n*\n\n*xrandr isn't working properly on my computer\n\n*There are some default settings which should have been set, but aren't, and I have no idea what they are. \nThank you for your help!\n\nA: I don't believe it is your Trusty system, I believe it is the cable.\nI bought this same adapter that you specified from startech.com, but for my Windows 10 PC to the 30\" Apple cinema display. I am not able to get over 1280 resolution on this, either. I do suspect the cable, because I am able to use the 30\" cinema display at full resolution when I use a dual DVI to Displayport cable. That cable has the extra USB cable attached needed for power. The Startech adaptor does not have that, so I tried just plugging in the monitor's USB cable, but it doesn't seem to work that way.\nUPDATE 2019: I am now using Ubuntu 19.04 happily with the same setup; 1 connection uses the traditional DVI to miniDP cord from Apple, and the other monitor uses the same Bizlink/Dell dual DVI (plus a DP-to-Thunderbolt C adaptor since my Linux laptop does not have a DisplayPort). Note that I did have to tweak the Bios to get my System76/Clevo laptop to recognize the monitor on the Thunderbolt C though.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem. I wasn't able to get 2560x1600 from HP ZDisplay while connected with VGA, Mini DisplayPort/HDMI or Mini DisplayPort/HDMI + HDMI/HDMI cables. I've solved it by buying a Mini DisplayPort/DisplayPort cable with a declared support for 2560x1600 and using it.\n", "Q: How to block internet access for an application I'd search for a way to run an application prevent it from accessing internet, possibly without install a specific program to do this.

To fix it:\n\nIn PuTTY, go to “Connection → SSH → Kex”. There, select “Diffie-Hellman group exchange” and move it to the bottom of the list, so it is not used. The connection should start working as normal again.\n\n", "Q: 14.04 Lockscreen show all users In 14.04, When I have an active session and lock screen via shortcut super-l, or Gear->\"lock/switch account\", the lock screen only shows my user with password.\nTo login as someone else, (my 5 year old likes to play minecraft while I am away), you have to click on the Gear->(\"Switch Account...\" or a specific user) to be shown a list of users to login as.\nIs there any way to change the default behavior so that when I lock screen, it goes right to the list of users, rather than only my user?\n\nA: You need to enable user list and then you can switch user on the login screen.\nPlease read this carefully and try to reverse the process http://www.webupd8.org/2014/08/lightdm-how-to-disable-user-list-or.html\nSorry, I cant find matched scenario.

I've just installed Crouton KDE on my Chromebook. All went well, however, I downloaded Popcorn Time for Linux64 from their site, it's in my downloads folder, but I have no idea how to install it? I also downloaded Firefox from their website, it did the same.\nBasically, everywhere I've read on the internet people say \"right click on the .tar file and click \"extract\", however I don't even have an extract option when I right click????\nAny help, suggestions or alternate ways to install these file types would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks :)\n\nA: Depending on the file manager you are using you may need additional packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*file-roller  - archive manager that supports tar files etc\n\n*nemo-fileroller - plugin for the Nemo file manager (only) that enables the the Right Click extract button\n\n\nYou can install them via apt-get - e.g sudo apt-get install file-roller. You may also be able to do this from and installed graphical package managers such as the Software Center or Synaptic.\nAlternatively, you may be able to open the archive via Right Click > Open With 'Archive Manager' or similar. You can use command line as well:\ntar xf archive.tar.gz\n\nTar should recognize any extra format (source) and use the appropriate decompress or (e.g gunzip (gz))\nN.B. tar files are files that can contain files and folders in one file (without compression). Gunzip, 7zip, etc can be used to compress tar files to reduce their size, making file names such as archive.tar.gz or archive.tar.7z etc. Sort of similar to .zip files\n", "Q: Why won't DNS resolve?

I have Dell Inspiron 3442 with dual graphics Intel Haswell and Nvidia 820m. I installed Nvidia 352 driver prime along with xorg that came installed by default. At some times after startup it shows running in low graphic mode and i just restart it. How can i solve this problem?\nI also tried downloading wine and it showed dependencies cant be resolved. Also tried these apt-get commands,\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nbut nothing seems to work. Is it also because of graphics driver?\n\nA: First, let me make something clear, the problems you encounter while installing wine and those of graphics card are totally two different problems. Let's sort out your problems with wine installation first.\nFrom what it seems your wine has some problems with dependencies, \nMake sure you didn't add some custom repositories or ppas, if you did remove them from /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d and then do following, \nRemove wine completely\nsudo apt-get purge wine\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nThen, solve existing dependency problems\nsudo apt-get install -f \nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nNow once your dependencies are sorted you should get your graphics drivers sorted out, If you have hybrid graphics you will have to choose which graphics card to use, in your case i would suggest Nvidia rather than intel. Luis Alvarado has already written a very comprehensive guide for installing graphics driver in ubuntu here, Check it out and set up your display drivers.\nAfter that is done, you will want to reinstall wine to play games or install windows softwares, to do that, type in,\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nIt should install without any problems.\n", "Q: How Can I reinstall 64 bit ubuntu over 32 bit I installed 32 bit ubuntu on my vista because it ran 32 bit windows however with 3 gigs of ram I think I can push the 64 bit. My pc is freezing a lot which it never did with vista. \nHow can I wipe and reinstall ubuntu? \n\nA: If your machine is truly 64bit compatible (which is an absolute requirement), you will have to reinstall Ubuntu completely if you are wanting the 64-bit version. \nYou can just re-run the 64bit liveCD and keep the default partitioning settings, or if you wanted more control...\nRun the liveCD like you would normally, and select \"Something else...\" in the partitioning. \"Change\" the ext4 partition on your computer. Check \"format this drive\" and set the mount point to \"/\". You should have a swap already in place, but if you don't, create one with at least 3Gbs in size.\nThere isn't a ton of improvement from 32bit to 64bit, but if your system IS 64bit compatible, you can try it. But again (third time here), you need to make sure your system is 64bit compatible! If it ran 32bit Windows, it sounds like it might be 32bit only! \nThe \"bit\" of the computer is based on the hardware, not just the RAM. It's the CPU and motherboard, so look up your specs on google and see if it's really 64 bit.\n", "Q: When removing Ubuntu for windows should I delete all partitions? I'm about to install Windows 10 from a usb. Currently the only operating system on my computer is Ubuntu. I want to remove Ubuntu for windows 10 and probably create a dual boot at a later time. \nWhen I am in the installer Page for windows 10 regarding portions should I delete all of the partitions for the drive I am installing to? In this case it is the SSD that Ubuntu is currently installed on. \nThere are 3 partitions. One 215gb, one 512mb and one 7.9gb. The drive is meant to be 240gb.\n\nA: You will want to remove all partitions from the install disk, yes. Windows will create its own partition (or two, depending if it wants a D: drive). When installing Ubuntu later, you will recreate 2 more partitions. \nBeware that you will lose ALL data on the Ubuntu partitions. Make sure you've saved your documents, pictures, videos, etc. before doing this.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14 and PXE - Variable to pass to specify install path?

Is it possible to use graphics card only for computation and not for display? I am sure it must be possible to disconnect graphics card from display but I want it to be available for computation. How could I achieve it?\n\nA: NVIDIA has a suggestion for this question.\nTheir recommendation is to use two GPUs: one for X, and one for computation.  They also suggest disabling X, limiting the CUDA kernel to short execution times, and turning off interactive mode in the NVIDIA driver.\nYou don't say that you're using an NVIDIA graphics card, but some of these suggestions may work for any graphics card.\nIf your motherboard has onboard graphics in addition to a discrete graphics card, you may be able to configure the BIOS to use the onboard graphics for your display.\n", "Q: How to recover mysql password?

It flickers to fast to read for sure.\nI do not want windows 8 which was installed, just ubuntu.\nI have tried boot-repair but that didnt work even using advanced options\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12596200/\nI have tried re-installing many times but the result is the same and i am getting very frustrated with it now.\nMartynT\n\nA: You've got a lot of useless NVRAM entries, as revealed by the efibootmgr output in your Boot Repair output. I don't think that's the real problem, but you might try removing them, thus:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 0001 -B\n\nRepeat that for 000E, 000F, 0010, 0011, 0012, 0013, and 0014, in addition to 0001. When you've done this, reboot. I doubt if it will fix anything, but it might.\nNext, enter your firmware setup utility and, if you enabled it, disable your CSM (aka legacy boot mode support). This feature, although sometimes useful, complicates the boot path and can create problems. If your computer is trying to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, it's probably reading the GRUB you've got in your MBR, which is failing because, as Boot Repair says:\n => Grub2 (v1.99-2.00) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda and looks at sector \n    1060428 of the same hard drive for core.img, but core.img can not be found \n    at this location.\n\nIn other words, the BIOS-mode GRUB is only partly installed. Your EFI-mode GRUB seems better, and is configured to launch first if the computer is booting in EFI mode; however, it's possible that there's something wrong with it.\nIf you still can't boot at this point, I recommend you download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Prepare a boot medium from that and boot from it. It should enable you to boot Ubuntu. There will probably be two entries, one of which boots GRUB (which I expect will fail if the preceding procedures don't help) and one of which boots a Linux kernel directly (which I expect should boot). If you can boot via the external rEFInd medium, you can try installing it to your hard disk via the PPA or Debian package; or you can try to manually debug GRUB.\n", "Q: Upstart job not recognized I wrote a simple upstart job:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nexec dnscrypt-proxy -E -R cisco-ipv6\n\nIt starts properly on boot, but is still not recognized by service --status-all and initctl list.

Still it does not expain why some service require root permission to be displayed, while others does not, as all .conf files have exactly the same owner and permission.\n\nA: it seems like your dnscrypt-proxy -E -R cisco-ipv6 need networking and your init script running before network and other needed service so write you script like \nstart on started networking \n\nor \nstart on network-interface-up INTERFACE=eth0 \n\nif your service need file system then you can write \nstart on filesystem and started networking\n\nand \nif this depend on other service also then include \nstart on started other-service\n\nyou can learn from here\n", "Q: How can I copy and combine several .txt lists in alphabetical order?

Firstly, I want to thank you as finally I found IP addresses that were connected to my modem.

I want to find their mac address and remove those devices from my Wi-Fi using Gnome-Terminal. I am able to do this using modem interface but I want to work on Ubuntu and learn Linux, so I want to do this using Terminal. İs it possible? If yes, please tell me how?\n\nA: You can use nmap with any of several options. The machines must be on the same LAN, no router in between.\n\n\n*\n\n*nmap -sP\n\n*nmap -sn\n\n*nmap -sL\n\n*nmap -PU\nSee man nmap and / or: https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html\n\nA: If you are interested in using something other than nmap, there is also a tool called tuxcut that lets you scan and block other devices's MAC address connected to the same LAN as yours.\nFind the tool here.\n\nA: An alternative to nmap would be arp-scan.

How do I turn off the Intel integrated graphics and only use my discrete nvidia 960m card?\nI know I can install bumblebee and then use optirun, but I want to use the nvidia card by default. I always use my laptop with the power cord plugged in so power savings I do not care about. I just want to maximize my computer.\nFor instance, I want unity to run with my nvidia card. I preferable do not want to fiddle around in the boot script and find where unity is launched, and then prepend with optirun.\nIs there any way to do this?\nEdit\nDo I even need bumblebee? I read somewhere that the nvidia-settings have the option to change between the nvidia card and the integrated one. But it shows up empty for me. Is this because bumblebee blocks nvidia? So if I remove bumblebee, then nividia drivers will be launched and then I can change to use the card in nvidia-settings?\nAfter some more investigation (link):\n\nAnyway, basically the official NVIDIA proprietary driver for Linux does now include an option (as long as nvidia-prime and/or Xorg is setup correctly) to switch between the Intel GPU and the NVIDIA GPU in the NVIDIA Control Panel. However, this is not real-time switching. You do have to log out and log back in for the change to take effect, so in the end you can only choose to use one GPU or the other at any one time. There is no dynamic switching. On the other hand if you don't care about battery life or heat or they aren't really a factor for you, you could just choose to use the NVIDIA GPU all the time, which is probably what a lot of heavy gamers would choose to do.\n\nSo I guess I should be able to switch to the nvidia card in the nvidia-settings, but the bumbleebee/nvidia-prime/nouveau is blocking it. Stuff also gets installed automatically when I installed from scratch (both 14.04 and 15.04) so I guess I have to look what it is using, then purging bumbleebee/nvidia-prime/nouveau and installing the nvidia drivers from official repo, should make it come up in the nvidia-settings.\n\nA: Use this command line to purge the integrated graphics driver:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\nWarning: This will remove the Nouveau driver completely, if you only wish to switch between Nouveau and NVidia please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics\n\nA: Forget the bumblebee package if you just want to run the Nvidia hardware full time.  Install the suggested (latest, tested) Nvidia driver from the Software & Updates program under the Additional Drivers tab. If you really need a later version of the driver than the one offered, first try the graphical-drivers ppa, and lastly, the vendor's download.  The drivers offered by Canonical will have the scripting to get updated with every kernel update -- the others, well, you may be on your own (reinstall).  \nOne last thing, which lately became available in Ubuntu 18.04, don't use the wayland login choices.  Formerly, the Wayland choices were not even offered when Nvidia drivers were installed, but now they are, and choosing Wayland will switch to the integrated video (Intel,...).\n", "Q: How is trim enabled in Ubuntu 15.04?

I am trying to create a minimal install of Ubuntu Server 14.04.3. I selected the \"minimal\" option during installation.\nMy system now has two meta packages, ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard. The latter contains many packages which go above and beyond what I would consider a \"minimal\" installation for a server e.g. telnet and ftp clients.\nI would like to remove some of these packages however doing so will also remove the metapackage. The description of ubuntu-standard contains the following warning:\n\nIt is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that it not be removed.\n\nI can find little information on what this actually means. The best I've come up with is this answer, which suggests that the removal of a metapackage will cause problems when upgrading to a new version of Ubuntu.\nOther than when upgrading to new versions of Ubuntu, are there any other consequences of removing a metapackage? Is it possible that a package could be added to or removed from the metapackage for security reasons, that I would miss out on in the absence of the metapackage? E.g. it is decided that Package X should now be part of ubuntu-standard to fix some newly discovered security issue. Will the update process of any remaining packages on my system be unaffected?\n\nA: Of course you could. A metapackage is just a convenient way of bundling packages. Sure, they may come with stuff you don't immediately or ever need, but if at some point you decide that you need a desktop environment after all, you'll be happy about ubuntu-desktop or the like.\nThat said, I don't see any good reason why you should do so. Looking at the dependencies of ubuntu-standard, I find the vast majority of packages it installs are quite essential. Especially for administrating a system from the command line. The fact that you don't need an ftp client today, doesn't mean you won't need one in the future.\nFurthermore, those aren't large packages. ftp takes about 140kB disk space. If the available space is that constraint, I think Ubuntu is not the right distribution for your needs.\nFinally, if in a year or so you decide to upgrade to 16.04 LTS, you'll find yourself reinstalling that metapackage to make the release upgrade work.\nActually, there is one other thing. The packages installed through a metapackage are marked automatically installed. Meaning, if the metapackage is removed, the package system will suggest them for autoremoval unless you mark them as manually installed. Although I believe that is not the case for metapackages installed at system setup, only for those installed later. Take a look yourself and see if e.g ftp is marked auto or not: apt-mark showauto | grep ftp\nIn principle, if the dependencies of a metapackage change, you will miss out on those changes. You will still receive updates for the currently installed packages though, depending on which repositories are enabled.\nIf this happens in practice except with new releases I do not know, but I doubt it. The only prominent counterexample I can think of are the kernel metapackages. They will (on the desktop releases anyway) always point to the latest available kernel. Removing the metapackages will prevent new kernels from being installed. That may be wanted, but the better solution would be to hold the metapackage.\nIn my opinion you likely won't break anything, so I can't advise against it absolutely. But personally I don't think it worthwhile. At least not regarding such small and yet very handy tools.\nAddendum: OP makes a compelling point in the comments below. Security must be taken very seriously especially in a server setting. Minimizing attack vectors includes getting rid of unneeded and unwanted software. If you find a piece of software that poses a potential security risk and is not necessary, by all means get rid of it! \nOn a server running a sensitive service, say Kerberos, I think it's really best practice to strip the system down to the essentials. \nThat said, since the question is about ubuntu-standard, I didn't see any harm with the packages installed. So I stand by my opinion :-)\n", "Q: Unable to load mod_alias in apache Runing the command sudo service apache2 restart output :   \n * Restarting web server apache2                                         [fail] \n\n* The apache2 configtest failed.\n\nOutput of config test was:\napache2: Syntax error on line 140 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/alias.load: Cannot load /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_alias.so into server: /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_alias.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n\nHow to solve it?\n\nA: Working fine.  credits to @A.B.\nFollowing Steps :\n1.If not, backup your configurations and install apache2 again via\nsudo mv /etc/apache2 /etc/apache2.bak\nsudo apt-get purge apache2\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n2.Restart your server and check if the problem is solved\nsudo service apache2 restart\nIf you get a error message like\nThe apache2 configtest failed.

I'm unable to install Ubuntu 14.4.3 into the PC. I have created a flash drive (thumb drive) with Ubuntu on it using the tool in pendrivelinux.com/\nFirst of all, I don't see the welcome screen that should look like this at all:\n\nI see a black and white screen with the logo of Ubuntu and a bunch of options one below the other and I have no idea why. I can try Ubuntu using the flash drive. When I attempt to install it, it simply doesn't let me.\nWhen I reach the step where I must select the installation type, I can't select the 1st option,which is \"Install Ubuntu Inside Windows 7\" it simply restarts the PC and nothing happens. I can't select the 2nd option, that is \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" since I need Windows and it allows me to proceed with the 3rd option, that is 'Something Else'\nAfter I continue, I see a page where I must select the device for boot loader.\nIf I try to make a new partition table ( using /dev/sda ) , it tells me that it will delete all other partitions so I can't do that. And obviously I can't install the Ubuntu loader on the Windows loader or recovery stuff.  And I can't install it on unallocated space that I freed by shrinking Local Disk (C:) because it tells me that it is unusable. I can't install it on /dev/sda itself because it tells me that there is no root file defined.\nCan someone please me kind enough to help me proceed with the installation process.

I still need help from you on how to install Ubuntu using \"Something else\" option. Please note that for me, it is displaying as \"Install In Windows 7\" rather than displaying it as \"Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows 7\"\n\nA: The 1st option didn't work for you, and I think that might be because of the installation media's fault. Anyway, I'll go on to the 3rd option. \nFirst you will need to have free space. So shrink some hard disk and leave about 12 or 15 GB at least.

After you have some free space, click on Free Space And click on the + sign which will be on bottom left corner (if there is no + sign, then there'll probably be Add Button.

If you want to do it then create another partition, use ext3 or ext4 and choose mount point as /home\nAnd that's basically it. You can continue installation.

When the monitor is disconnected that problem doesn't happen. \nSo, can I fix this increasing the BlueTooth priority process, or doing anything else.\n\nA: This could be related to the \"Sync To VBlank\" setting in \"OpenGL\", which you can deactivate via the CompizConfig Settings Manager as reported in Mouse lag after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nNote: I say, \"could be\", because you're mentioning the monitor, hence it may be graphics related.

Either you maker the file accessable and or you run the mail client with different rights. Note: You can do that from the same user account. The rights just need to be granted to the program reading that file, preferable in such a way that the original user account cannot also grant those rights to herself.\n(E.g., you could create a group 'games; and make the file or the folder it is stored in only readable(r,x) by the group games.

To restore a default setting each time we start evince we can just adapt the printer settings to our needs and let evince display a preview to save these settings.\nWe can now copy printer settings in a default file, e.g. \ncp ~/.config/evince/print-settings ~/.config/evince/print-settings-default\n\nto copy back these settings to the defaults for starting evince.\nThis can be done by calling a script like below:\n#! /bin/bash\n\ncp ${HOME}/.config/evince/print-settings-default ${HOME}/.config/evince/print-settings\nevince \"$*\"\n\nfrom a custom evince.desktop file we save in ~/.local/share/applications to override the default evince.desktop file in /usr/share/application (we can use this as a template to only change the Exec line pointing to our script above).\nBy this we could also create script with different printer settings for different tasks which we can then call by a custom .desktop file.\n", "Q: Conditional Formatting for Spreadsheet Cells based on Time Value (HH:MM:SS) I want the highlight the cells in libreoffice which is time filled in the cell is more than 9:00:00. \nI tried format-> conditional formatting->condition.\nI get the cells highlighted based on single value but i didn't get how to highlight the cell with time based.\nI tried TIMEVALUE but cells doesn't highlight, see the pic.. \n\nI did any thing wrong, give comment\n\nA: You'll have to use the TIMEVALUE() function to convert the time string 09:00:00 into a time value that LO can use for comparison (if you're using a different localization than English, you may have to translate the function name accordingly - for the localized name, follow this link and select the appropriate language from the language bar at the top of the help page).

I was checking instructions on the Internet about how to install. Someone said to use the second option i.e erase disk and install. I got idea that it will delete only windows partition but everything is gone now and i have two partitions now. Root n home respectively. I have lost extremely important data. Is there anyway that i can recover it. I really need it. Please help me now.\n\nA: BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, turn off the machine (using the hard power switch, not by shutting it down) containing the hard drive which you want to recover data from, and do not turn it back on again until you know what you are doing. Any OS or software you run from that hard drive has the potential to further corrupt your data while it runs.\nWhether or not any of the data is recoverable will depend on a number of factors. Essentially it boils down to, (a) where on the hard drive the data is stored, and (b) whether or not the Ubuntu installation process (and anything you ran subsequently) overwrote that data with new data.\nThere is plenty of software out there which is designed for recovering lost data. However, because you said that the data is extremely important and because of your lack of experience (which I'm assuming, due to the fact that you thought \"erase disk\" would preserve partitions), I would suggest that you don't attempt any data recovery yourself and instead contact a specialist data recovery company. Get a quote, and decide whether or not the cost is justified by the value to you of your data.\nIf you do decide to attempt data recovery yourself, do not do so using any OS or software running on the drive itself. Ideally you want to mount the drive in read only mode in a OS running from some other medium (e.g. CD, second hard drive, USB drive, etc.).\nClick here for a list of data recovery software, and in particular a list of live distributions that are geared towards data recovery.\n\nA: One of the tools i can recomend you is photorec however i would recommend this tool only if you plan on getting back non common files since if you try to recover files like pictures this tool will retrieve a lot of junk data like thumbnails of websites you visited years ago and will consume your disk space really quick, also please keep in mind not all data can be saved in the case something else was rewritten; i would recomend that if you have an external hard drive to store the files being recovered there, and as i was pointed out on the comments, it is a good idea to use a live cd or a live usb just to avoid the corruption of other files while the recovery takes place. with that in mind lets begin.\nTo install you would need the package testdisk on a terminal type\nsudo apt-get install testdisk \nto run the program you simply type on the terminal\nphotorec\nyou will need to choose in which hard drive you want to recover from select the one you want and the just press enter on proceed,\nafterwards you will be asked to choose from which partition and at the bottom you will have 4 options you can access them by using the arrows left and right and pressing enter as i would recomend to go to [file opt] so you can specify what type of file you want to recover and then go over search so the program can look for it.\nAfterwards you will be asked what kind of partition the files were stored, for windows they usually are NTFS partitions so you will need to choose the second option, then you will be asked if you want to check only the unallocated space this works only with ext3/ext4 so you will need to choose the [whole] option.\nFor last you will be asked where you want to save the information you only need to choose the folder --Tip you can also cd, on to the folder where you want to save, before running photorec so that way at this point will show the current directory and you dont have to navigate. \nI wish you luck. \n", "Q: Netbeans cannot find java I uninstalled Openjdk 7 and installed Oracle Java from webupd8.

Issue is seeming to occur because generic Ubuntu driver for rtl8192cu chip is not fully able to handle WNA3100M.\nHow to solve issue:\nStep 1:\nInstall custom driver for WNA3100M. This will replace generic Ubuntu driver for rtl8192cu chip with a custom driver named 8192cu.\nTo do this, go to this link and follow all steps in Installation section:\nhttps://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes\nRESTART SYSTEM.\nTo check whether installation was successful or not, you can run dkms status in terminal. The output should say installed for driver 8192cu.

Is it returning error? If so, you must solve it and make sure that driver loads.\nIn my case, driver was not loading because of secure boot option in UEFI BIOS setting. I disabled secure boot option in BIOS menu and driver loaded automatically.\nWays to disabling secure boot in UEFI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable secure boot option from UEFI BIOS menu (pressing F2 or DEL when computer starts, going to advanced mode etc. Google with your motherboard's model to find out exact steps)\n\n*Using mokutil ubuntu package (I have not tried this option)\n\n\nIn a nutshell, you have to install custom driver and make sure it loads.\n", "Q: Ads by LaSuperba showing on every browser A few days ago an ad \"Powered by LaSuperba\" is showing on every broser of my Ubuntu 14.04.

I've been fiddling with the configuration files and also found this: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html\nthat website I just pasted there says that it isn't so easy as to defining in some 'apache2's' config file what your site's name is to make users type that name on a web browser and find your site. It would also take (so is suggested on that page) to let the dns in use know what your site's url is and what ip it should match it with, or something of the like I understand.\nNow, I'm working on a LAN, with my linux box giving network ip numbers to client pcs and setting itself as the default gateway.\nWhere should I look for the dns configuration so to setup www.mywonderfulsite.com -> 192.168.1.1 (linux box)\nor so to speak.\nI hope anyone reading this understands what I'm trying to achieve...\n\nA: See man dnsmasq, which says, in part:  \ntrusty (8) dnsmasq.8.gz\nProvided by: dnsmasq-base_2.68-1_i386 bug\n\nNAME\n\n       dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n       dnsmasq [OPTION]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n       dnsmasq  is a lightweight DNS, TFTP, PXE, router advertisement and DHCP\n       server. It is intended to provide coupled DNS and  DHCP  service  to  a\n       LAN.\n\n       Dnsmasq  accepts  DNS  queries  and  either  answers them from a small,\n       local, cache or forwards them to a  real,  recursive,  DNS  server.  It\n       loads  the  contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not\n       appear in the global DNS can be resolved and also answers  DNS  queries\n       for  DHCP  configured  hosts.  It can also act as the authoritative DNS\n       server for one or more domains, allowing local names to appear  in  the\n       global DNS.\n\nSo, it seems to me that you should (on each and every client) add to /etc/hosts \n192.168.1.1 www.mywonderfulsite.com  \n\nAny other asliases for 192.168.1.1 should appear on the same line, not separate lines.

I've read the various packaging guides and I'm still not sure what the best practice is.\nEssentially, how do I build a package from launchpad, handling dependencies and chrooted build environments just like the build bots do? \n\nA: The software used to build Ubuntu source packages in a chroot is called sbuild . Some introduction to setting up and using sbuild is given in the SimpleSbuild wiki article.\nThere are many ways to download a source package and to set up an sbuild chroot, but the ubuntu-dev-tools  package includes a couple of very useful scripts for accomplishing exactly what you want.\nAssuming you are running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you can set up a chroot and build the bash package for example, with\nsudo apt-get install sbuild ubuntu-dev-tools\nmk-sbuild trusty\npull-lp-source -d bash trusty\nsbuild -A -d trusty bash_4.3-7ubuntu1.5.dsc\n\nwhere the filename of the source package given to the sbuild command will of course change with updates and new releases.\nThe mk-sbuild command need only be run one time, the minimal chroot is cached on your system and can be reused for building any number of source packages.\n", "Q: What will formatting linux partitions do?

However, the partition table entry for the partition you format might get changed.\nWindows sometimes has a problem with changing partitions and sometimes doesn't. Your Windows might fail to boot after you formatted or partitioned but you can \"fix\" this with the Windows DVD.

The new table will be used at\nthe next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)\nSyncing disks.\n\n\nHow do I solve this problem? Please help.\n\nA: You are having this problem because /dev/sdb is mounted (type mount | grep /dev/sdb to see), and its meta-information is in the System's RAM, and the system has it \"locked\" to prevent multiple uncontrolled access . If you umount /dev/sdb before you sudo fdisk /dev/sdb, the system will ensure that the \"disk\"'s meta-information is up-to-date on \"disk\", then forget the in-memory copy of the meta-information, and let you adjust/trash the SD card to your heart's content.\n", "Q: pam_tally2 doesn't count fails over ssh I have added line \nauth required pam_tally2.so deny=3 unlock_time=180\n\nto my /etc/pam.d/login file, and that's fine and dandy in tty, after 3 attempts testuser gets suspended. \nHowever, that very same line in /etc/pam.d/sshd produces no effect.\nxieerqi:$ ssh testuser@localhost\nPassword: \nPassword: \nPassword: \nPermission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).\n\nxieerqi:$ ssh testuser@localhost                                                                                           \nPassword: \nPassword: \nPassword: \nPermission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).\n\nAs you can see after 3 unsuccessful attempts, the user still can attempt entering password.\nHow do I make ssh ban a user after 3 strikes?\n\nA: For SSH it might be better to use something different than pam there is a great solution made through iptables and the sshd_config file. This is only one way to get what you want, also based on documentation usually it is recommended to use SSH Keys instead of a password authentification method check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring. \n\n\n*\n\n*You would need to change the /etc/ssh/sshd_config adding the line \nMaxAuthTries 1\n\n\n*You need to create the following firewall rules\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new chain \niptables -N SSHATTACK   \niptables -A SSHATTACK -j LOG --log-prefix \"Possible SSH attack! \" --log-level 7  \niptables -A SSHATACK -j DROP  \n\n\n*Block each IP address for 120 seconds which establishe more than three connections within 120 seconds. In case of the forth connection attempt, the request gets delegated to the SSHATTACK chain, which is responsible for logging the possible ssh attack and finally drops the request.\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --dport 22 --state NEW -m recent --set     \niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --dport 22 --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 120 --hitcount 4 -j SSHATTACK    \n\n\n\n*You can check the attempts made on the file /var/log/syslog.\n\nA: The common practice is to use fail2ban which works on network level instead of pam level and which saves your resources for all that crypto done by sshd.\nAnyway, did you try after that failed authentication to insert correct password? Is it accepted?

The software runs perfectly with Lubuntu, under Wine, of course.\nThe only one problem I have is that the software uses a \"profile\" bank (to read the multimedia database) made under Windows, and all the files and folders references were made to the Windows drive \"D:\".\nHow can I tell to this software (under Wine) that the second partition of the HDD is the Drive \"D:\"? Can I? ???\n\nA: You can, by running winecfg:\n\nGo the Drives tab:\n\nClick Add...:\n\nSelect your drive letter, press Ok, then enter the path where the target drive is mounted in Ubuntu. For example, my common partition is mounted on /home/muru/Downloads:\n\nClick Apply. Done.\n", "Q: Is it possible to symlink file to system folders? Let's say there is a script in my home folder I would like to use in /etc/cron.* folder or in other system folders. Is there any way how to do it without copying the file to the target location?\nWould symlink or hardlink do the job? I tried that out and it seems it's not working. Why not? Permission of symlink and the script seems to be OK.\nThank you for you explanation.\n\nA: Every file has 1 hard link. If it doesn't have one, the space it occupies can be overridden. If you make another hard link, the count goes up to 2 without using double the space on the HDD because both hard links point to the same piece of storage space.\nThat said, there is no original. If you make additional hard links of a file, every one of them is as good as any other one. So make hard links of the files and copy one of each to your destination.\n", "Q: SYnaptics wants to redownload already downloaded deb packages I recently reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop from scratch. Now, after installing system, I wanted to update the system as well as install other applications which I use.\nSo, I did an sudo apt-get update an then installed Synaptic.\nThereafter, I marked all upgrades and made a download script through Synaptic. Next, I searched and marked all the applications I want to install and generated other download script.\nNext, I went to my brother's system having high speed net connectivity and downloaded applications as per both scripts, totaling 1619 deb files of around 900 MBs. Then, I took this whole deb file folder to my laptop and tried to install them through Synaptic [files>add downloaded packages].\nBut, Synaptic, showed it still needs to download ~65 MB of files. So, I proceeded with the install and then canceled as soon as it started downloading files. So, it showed a windows, stating which files it wanted to download. When, I inspected the files, I found that I already have those packages, though I have 64 bit version, and Synaptic wanted 32 bit. I however still copied them in a txt file and downloaded them again via my another PC. Came back, made a consolidated folder and retried to install them through Synaptic.\nNow, it again showed it wants to download around ~66 MB of files. So, I repeated the above stated process to find out which files do it still needs. This time, I noticed that it wants to download files, which are already downloaded and are in that consolidated folder.\nI cleared apt-cache, but still the same result. I moved those 'problematic' deb files to another folder and this time tried to install them only specifically, but synaptic just seems not to see anything in that folder.\nSo, my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening and how to resolve it? Why it want to download those files, when they are already downloaded.\n\n*Why do Ubuntu install some 32 bit versions on a 64 bit machine, even when 64 bit versions' deb are available.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem as you and the only way to resolve it was to use dpkg. Thus, all packages that were already downloaded were installed and Ubuntu did not ask to download them again. I hope it helps you.\nWith regard to the 32-bit libraries, Ubuntu installs to ensure compatibility with other programs or processes that may need them. I also think it's a waste of space, but anyway...\n", "Q: Download manager with browser integration in chrome I just want the closest experience to how Internet Download Manager used to work in Windows.

But how would you do this if you want to pass the contents of a file as arguments through the command line? \nTo elaborate, let's say file.txt is the file i'm interested in, which simply contains two integers on separate lines. \nEDIT:\nI tried the xargs command:\n       xargs program.cc < file.txt > outputresult.txt\n\nBut this ends up printing what I have in cout, e.g.:\n     A program which adds two integers\n     Enter 1st integer: Enter 2nd integer: Sum is 2\n\nI only want what is cout'ed AFTER all my arguments have been passed. How do I do this?\n\nA: The way you have written it, you need to pass the contents of the file to your program, not the file itself (and there's no need for xargs, by the way). One way to do that is using input redirection:\na.out < file\n\nFor example:\n$ cat file\n4 \n7\n$ ./a.out < file\nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: Enter 2nd integer: Sum is 11\n\nAnother way to do the same thing is to print the file's contents and pass the to your program with a pipe:\n$ cat file | ./a.out \nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: Enter 2nd integer: Sum is 11\n\nA much cleaner approach, of course, would be to write your program so that it can take arguments instead of reading standard input:\n./a.out 4 7\n\nOr, write it so that it can open files internally and parse them for its input data:\n./a.out file\n\nAnyway, in order to get only the last line in the output, print the rest to standard error:\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n  int x, y, sum;\n  std::cerr << \"A program which adds two integers\\n\";\n  std::cerr << \"Enter 1st integer: \";\n  std::cin >> x;\n  std::cerr << \"Enter 2nd integer: \";\n  std::cin >> y;\n  std::cerr << \"\\n\";\n  sum = x + y;\n  std::cout << \"Sum is \" << sum << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n\nNow, run:\n$ ./a.out < file > output.txt\nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: Enter 2nd integer: \n$ cat output.txt\nSum is 11\n\nOr, to give the values manually:\n$ ./a.out > output.txt \nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: 4\nEnter 2nd integer: 7\n\n$ cat output.txt \nSum is 11\n\n\nA: As terdon pointed out already, to do this you want to either redirect stdin from a file (and call the program using e.g. program <inputfile.txt) or change your program so that it parses arguments passed from the command line (and call the program using e.g. program 1 2);\nIn the first case you want to suppress the first two couts if stdin is not connected to a terminal, and in the second case you want to suppress the first two couts, e.g., if, say, not enough arguments have been passed from the command line;\nSpeaking of the first method, you can check whether a file descriptor is connected to a terminal using the isatty() function (POSIX function defined in unistd.h):\nint isatty(int fd);\n\nIf fd is an opened file descriptor connected to a terminal, the function will return 1; If fd is not an opened file descriptor or is not connected to a terminal, the function will return 0:\n#include <iostream>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int x, y, sum;\n    std::cout << \"A program which adds two integers\\n\";\n    if(isatty(0)) {\n        std::cout << \"Enter 1st integer: \";\n    }\n    std::cin >> x;\n    if(isatty(0)) {\n        std::cout << \"Enter 2nd integer: \";\n    }\n    std::cin >> y;\n    sum = x + y;\n    std::cout << \"Sum is \" << sum << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis way the user will be prompted to insert the numbers only if stdin has not been redirected:\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % ./a.out               \nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: 1\nEnter 2nd integer: 2\nSum is 3\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % cat inputfile.txt \n3\n4\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % ./a.out <inputfile.txt \nA program which adds two integers\nSum is 7\n\nSpeaking of the second method, here's a very rough example on how to parse arguments passed from the command line (arguments passed from the command line are stored into argv, which is an array of pointers to a character, so you'll have to cast each argument to an integer, but don't use atoi()! Use something that allows you to check if the arguments are numeric or not. I used atoi() just for the sake of simplicity):\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    int x, y, sum;\n    std::cout << \"A program which adds two integers\\n\";\n    if(argc == 3) {\n        x = atoi(argv[1]);\n        y = atoi(argv[2]);\n    }\n    else {\n        std::cout << \"Enter 1st integer: \";\n        std::cin >> x;\n        std::cout << \"Enter 2nd integer: \";\n        std::cin >> y;\n    }\n    sum = x + y;\n    std::cout << \"Sum is \" << sum << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis way the user will be prompted to insert the numbers only if not enough arguments have been passed from the command line:\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % ./a.out\nA program which adds two integers      \nEnter 1st integer: 1\nEnter 2nd integer: 2\nSum is 3\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % ./a.out 3\nA program which adds two integers\nEnter 1st integer: ^C\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % ./a.out 3 4\nA program which adds two integers\nSum is 7\n\n\nA: So there are a few things you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can output to file within C++ using something like this. \n\n*You can remove the cout << \"Enter... lines in your code so the only output of the program is what goes into the file.\n\n*You can work around using the error output stream (cerr instead of cout) and manipulate the outputs accordingly. If you want cout visible and cerr in the file, do xargs program.cc < file.txt 2> outputresult.txt (using 2> instead of >). If you want cerr visible and cout in the file, do it as you had it above with just >.\n\n*Keep the output as it is now, but run 2 more executions that removes the unwanted lines from your code:\n\n\ncat outputresult.txt | grep Sum > tempfile && mv tempfile outputresult.txt\nYou can implement this with your code like this:\n./program.cc < file.txt | grep Sum > outputresult.txt\nThis method requires newlines to be written, however, so you'd have to make sure that the output it each in new lines.\nI would personally suggest using either the file management within C++ or the cout and cerr hack, depending on the use of the program.\n", "Q: ASUS Xonar Essence STX II on Xubuntu 15.04?

This is far simpler, and also allows for creation of other users on this storage medium):\nAssuming that /dev/sdb1 is formatted as ext4:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/f626cefe-8e59-4767-986a-32e282864a6f\nsudo cp -r /home/* /media/f626cefe-8e59-4767-986a-32e282864a6f/\nsudo mv /home /home.old\nsudo mkdir /home\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.old\necho \"/dev/sdb1              /home         ext4      defaults,noatime,user,auto      0      2\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1\n\nThen check to see that everything is as it should be.  If so, then reboot and check again.  If all goes as it should you will have 2TB of /home/ storage!  Once you have verified that everything is working as it should be, then and ONLY THEN can you run this commands:\nsudo rm -rf /home.old /etc/fstab.old\n\nIf all goes well, you will be up and running in no time.  Depending on how large your /home/ is, this could take an hour or more to copy over.\n\nA: You can sudo mv or sudo cp to the /media/f62...a6f directory if you just want the info there in storage (won't be modifying it a ton). \nYou can also modify your /etc/fstab and include a user option for the /dev/sdb1 entry. Then you, as a user, should be able to mount and modify anything in the directory. There are a lot of fstab options you can do that will set the permissions of the items.\nThis is an example of what I did for my backup drive:\n/dev/sdb1 /backup  ext4    defaults,user   0 0\nYou might also try sudo chown -R [yourusername]:[yourusername] /media/f62...a6f and sudo chmod -R 755 /media/f62...a6f if the above options still prevent you from adding files. \n", "Q: GNU Packages: compiling Can someone help me about free software from GNU project.

My team had a show-n-tell recently and I presented my findings on Docker. I explained how you can install Docker with:\ncurl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh\n\nI then explained that, with this installation, you need to prefix all Docker commands with sudo (e.g. sudo docker info), unless you run:\nsudo usermod -aG docker myUser\n\nOnce you do this, you can just run, say, docker info.\nAnother junior engineer asked me how this usermod command worked, and I explained it as I understand Linux users/groups:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the Docker binaries are installed on the system belonging to a group named docker\n\n*Since myUser is not by default a member of docker, it has no rwx permissions to do anything with the Docker binaries\n\n*So the solution is to either use sudo which gives you root permission for the given command, or to give myUser membership to the docker group\n\n\nWhen I explained it this way a senior engineer very abruptly told me I was wrong and that \"it's a little more complicated than that.\"\nSo I ask: am I misunderstanding Linux's security model here, and is the senior engineer correct? If so, what am I missing (and what the heck is \"so complicated\")? Or am I correct, in which case, can someone point me to some solid documentation to prove it?\n\nA: \nAll the Docker binaries are installed on the system belonging to a group named docker\n\nIncorrect. The docker binary is owned by root:root:\n$ stat `which docker`\n  File: ‘/usr/bin/docker’\n  Size: 16296881    Blocks: 31832      IO Block: 4096   regular file\nDevice: fc00h/64512d    Inode: 143202      Links: 1\nAccess: (0755/-rwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\n\n\nSince myUser is not by default a member of docker, it has no rwx permissions to do anything with the Docker binaries\n\nThe binaries are readable and executable by everyone.\n\nSo the solution is to either use sudo which gives you root permission for the given command, or to give myUser membership to the docker group\n\nThe Docker service uses a socket to listen for commands. The socket is typically:\n\n\n*\n\n*located at /var/run/docker.sock\n\n*owned by root:docker\n\n*and group-writable, but not readable or writeable by others:\n\n\nFor example:\n$ stat /var/run/docker.sock\n  File: ‘/var/run/docker.sock’\n  Size: 0           Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   socket\nDevice: 10h/16d Inode: 13619       Links: 1\nAccess: (0660/srw-rw----)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (  997/  docker)\n\nThat is why being a member of the docker group allows you to run docker commands.\nNote that you can specify which group should be used as a parameter to the docker service. From man docker:\n   -G, --group=\"\"\n Group  to assign the unix socket specified by -H when running in dae‐\n   mon mode.\n use '' (the empty string) to disable setting of a group.  Default  is\n   docker.\n\nSo, it doesn't have to be docker, but it is docker by default.\n\nA: If you are talking about how secure Linux is and the Vulnerability it can have yes. If I am understanding what you are asking clearly enough the answer for you is yes and my explanation is that Linux regardless of the distribution to my knowledge can get viruses like any other operating system depending what you install or not.

I working to improve my programming environment and now I need to have output of multiple commands (coffeescript/sass compilation and unit tests) in one console. This can be achieve concatenating commands with &:\nkarma start & coffee -o js/app -cw coffee/ & sass --watch sass/:css/\n\nbut when I would like to finish work and close them and press ctrl+c they will still work in background and I have to kill each of them manually. How can I fix this and have ability to close all those commands at once?\nCurrently I can only think of making a grunt task that will run multiple commands but using grunt seems to be an overkill for such a task. Are there easier/alternative ways?\n\nA: (Note: You can only Display one program/task at once. Also, some programs like apt-get don't work properly this way.)\n\nFirst, add an & symbol to the end of the line, so the line looks like this:\nkarma start & coffee -o js/app -cw coffee/ & sass --watch sass/:css/ &\n\nThat puts the last program in the background too.\n\nThen, type in jobs to list the programs. You'll then have an output that somewhat resembles this:\nkarma start [1]\ncoffee -o js/app -cw coffee/ [2]\nsass --watch sass/:css/ [3]\n\nTo bring a program to the foreground, type fg followed by the number of the program. For example, to bring karma start to the foreground, type fg 1. To put it back in the background, press Ctrl+Z. Repeat as required.\n\nA: Just kill the terminal...  That'll kill all commands it's running, unless you take special precautions like dtach...\n\nA: Use job to list your command, you will have something like this\nkarma start [1]\ncoffee -o js/app -cw coffee/ [2]\n\nUse fg 1 or fg 2 to bring back jobs in foreground.\n\nA: & doesn't concatenate commands.

Also, HWCLOCK did nothing but return an error.\nThe answer for me was:\nsudo timedatectl set-ntp false\nsudo timedatectl set-time \"date-time-string\"\n\nA: You can set the system date with this command:\nsudo date --set=\"2015-09-30 10:05:59.990\"\n\nThen when using date, it should be showed correctly.\nNow you should also the set hardware clock in the BIOS of the system, that the setting persists over a reboot (dureing the startup the system time is set to the value of the hardware clock). Do that with hwclock:\nsudo hwclock --systohc\n\nThis gets the system clocks (sys) value and sets the hardware clock (hc). Check it with the hwclock command. Both hwclock and date should now show the same date and time.\n\nTo set your timezone, you can use this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\n\nBTW: If you use a this machine as a server, I strongly recommend using an NTP-Client to sync the time over network. So you can guarantee that all your servers have the exactly same time set. This will sync the time while the machine runs. If you have applications which are dependent of synced time over server, I recommend the NTP-Daemon.

The same happens if I start Ubunutu from the Install-Disc. \nWhen I connect another monitor everything works fine and after connecting back to the LG monitor I also get an image with the resolution of the other monitor. But as soon as I restart or just logout, the screen becomes black again. \nIs there a way to set fixed resolutions like Full HD for Ubuntu, so that I could at least work with the monitor even if the ultra wide is not supported? \nAt the moment I refreshed my system and I can not do anything because of this problem. I tested Ubuntu 14.03 and 15.04. \nThe graphics card is an NVidia GTX 570 and the monitor is connected with the DVI graphics card output to the HDMI in of the monitor (Adapter is used).

post my solution here in case anyone else suffers from this.\nThe problem is that the delllctservice and delllctservicecontent scripts are missing LSB headers, which tell the system in what order to start them. Somehow during the upgrade this messes up the boot order, which breaks the insserv dependency calculation.\nIn order to fix this, temporarily move the delllctservice and delllctservicecontent scripts out of /etc/init.d/:\nmkdir ~/dell-init.d-backup\nsudo mv /etc/init.d/delllctservice* ~/dell-init.d-backup/\n\nThen try to fix your packages again:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nYou might need to do sudo dpkg --configure -a --force-depends instead depending on how bad things are.\nAfter that, moving the scripts back to /etc/init.d/ caused me no further problems.\nI reported this to Dell here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dell-sputnik/+bug/1605952\n\nA: We have talked a lot in chat and much tried.

I guess this happens because su can't locate /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. Seems like I've screwed up the system completely.\n\nA: Lets do another approach.

May be it will work. su has less dependencies, but requires to know real root password.\n\nA: Your applications can not run because they want to find libraries and those are misplaced too. Try using busybox directly.\nbin/busybox ls\n\nshould work as ls and so on. \n\nA: I just run into this problem exactly like this post. I'm using an Ubuntu server which has a disabled root user and is using sudo to do the root commands. so I can't log in with root user by any chance, the only way for me in the instance is making the sudo works. unfortunately, hours passed, I failed, that's too bad.\nAnd for users who can log in with the root, I suppose you guys forgot to mention another way which may be much easier: busybox sulogin\n", "Q: How to install HElib?

Boot-Repair doesn't help I installed Ubuntu 15.04 from an USB pendrive to my Toshiba Satellite U940.\nNormally this works great, but this time it was a real struggle. I had several issues regarding grub2, installation failed due to grub and so on. Now I finally managed to get it working but my EFI doesn't boot from the SSD. I also tried boot-repair of course. Still no bootable device according to the EFI. I managed to get a few lines of output by my PC via a slow-motion video. It says: \nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found\nFailed to load image \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi - Not Found\n\nand a few lines I can't properly read. \nBoot-repair pastebin url is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12623394/\nI'm booting in UEFI mode, all secure boot measures disabled. No dual boot, all hard drives fully deleted before install. \nHowever I'm installing Ubuntu and grub on /sdb not /sda, as sdb is my SSD and sda my HDD. Can this cause problems? The boot order is set to boot first from the SSD.\n\nA: There are several odd things about your setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your /dev/sda (a Toshiba MQ01ABD075_Y216FCTCS) is present, but doesn't appear to have a partition table or filesystem. This might be expected and harmless, depending on what that device is, but it's unclear what's causing this oddity.\n\n*Your /dev/sdb (a Samsung MZMPC032HBCD) is partitioned using the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table, but EFI-bootable disks normally use the GUID Partition Table (GPT).\n\n*Your EFI System Partition (ESP) is a logical partition on /dev/sdb (it's /dev/sdb6, to be precise). This might work, but only if your firmware isn't too finicky and if the NVRAM contains a pointer to the boot loader or if it's installed as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. At best, this is highly unusual.\n\n*The Boot Repair script turned up no evidence of any EFI boot loaders on /dev/sda or /dev/sdb. (/dev/sdc seems to be your emergency boot USB drive.) This is probably a bug in Boot Repair, but it makes it hard to judge what's actually booting.\n\n\nOverall, I'd say you need to repartition /dev/sdb to use GPT. (You can completely repartition it or use gdisk to convert it from MBR to GPT.) The Ubuntu installer should use GPT when it's fed a blank disk for an EFI-mode installation; however, it might stick with MBR if it's fed a pre-partitioned MBR disk. (I've not studied what the Ubuntu installer does in such a case -- and it might do different things depending on the Ubuntu version.) Alternatively, you need to mount /dev/sdb6, figure out where your boot loaders are, and adjust their paths appropriately; or use efibootmgr to create an entry that points to the boot loader. You might want to read my page on EFI boot loaders, and especially the sub-pages on EFI boot principles and installing EFI boot loaders, for more information. The inline links earlier provide background information, and so are worth reading, too.\n\nA: What helped was to not manually format the disks, rather let Ubuntu do the job. Strangely, no matter what I set as formation order etc., it didn't work. But when Ubuntu did it and formatted it as I did, it worked. Maybe the installer has trouble recognizing the EFI system partition.

I had to switch WiFi off and back on or connect to another network, before it worked again.\nSo I tried various things to get rid of this problem, mainly I tried different drivers and settings ( like this: samsung-series-9-np900x3a-no-wifi-internet ). Unfortunately I can't remember everything I did.\nLong story short: Since this morning, my WiFi adapter isn't found at all. There is no possibility to (de)activate it through UI, there are no wifi networks shown and I can't find wlan0 in terminal.\nHere is a copy of my wireless-info.txt\nI hope someone can help me.\nThanks in advance, \nFitzi.\n\nA: First, it appears that you have loaded the wrong driver. Let's remove it:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nAlso, in the version of iwlwifi that is included in kernel version 3.19-xx, there is a great deal more in the file iwlwifi.conf. Apparently, it has been overwritten. Please do:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Amend the file to read:\n# /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n# iwlwifi will dyamically load either iwldvm or iwlmvm depending on the\n# microcode file installed on the system.  When removing iwlwifi, first\n# remove the iwl?vm module and then iwlwifi.\nremove iwlwifi \\\n(/sbin/lsmod | grep -o -e ^iwlmvm -e ^iwldvm -e ^iwlwifi | xargs     /sbin/rmmod) \\\n&& /sbin/modprobe -r mac80211\noptions iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\n\nI doubt that you need the other options. Proofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nI notice in your paste that there are at least four access points with the same name. I suspect that the dropping may be because your wireless card is roaming from among them. I suggest you ask Network Manager to bind to the strongest one as described here: Ubuntu connect drops. Worked for a while then started dropping again\n", "Q: DirectX vs OpenGL We can run DirectX by using wine and OpenGL natively. So questions is:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the exact version of OpenGL equivalent to DirectX (ex. 11, 12 etc) can we compare like this?\n\n\nA: Well.\n\"We already know Ubuntu support DirectX by using wine and OpenGL natively.\"\nThis statement is so wrong on so many levels. Do you even understand what DirectX is?\nIn simple terms DirectX is a collection of libraries (*.dlls mostly), that serve to allow a developer easy access to Windows's lower level graphics, network and audio systems (maybe others too, never developed much with dx).\nDirectX is basically something that allows a convenience layer so you can do things like \"load and apply texture\" instead of having to read every byte of color value from your jpg/png/whatever and draw them between 3 or more points on the screen based on some \"geometry logic\" because that would significantly harden the task of developing multimedia applications.\nThis means that Ubuntu does not support DirectX in any way. For that matter nothing really supports DirectX beyond Windows (and maybe ReactOS though I've never tested that).\nBut I can run <insert whatever game here> on wine!\nYes. Yes you can but that does not mean that Ubuntu supports your game. It means that wine does.\nWine is a \"compatibility layer\" for Windows stuff. It basically converts and resolves calls recursively so that at the end some other library will do something similar to what the original call would have done. This naturally requires intricate understanding of what the original call would do on the original system (Windows), hence some things get developed only slowly if at all in wine (like DX11 support, or the supposed Pulse driver).\nSo the above should answer your third question, but basically:\n\"Yes we do and it is wine.\"\nFrom this you can see that your first question is kinda nonsensical since DX intends to focus on far more things than OpenGL.\nAs for the second question:\nIf we only consider the graphics part of of DX then I found OpenGL a bit more detailed (maybe even a bit convoluted) but ymmv.\n\nA: Graphics on Linux is almost exclusively implemented using the X windows system. Supporting OpenGL on Linux involves using GLX extensions to the X Server. So it depends on which GPU you are using. \nIt is supported by -\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD/ATI\n\n*Intel\n\n*Nvidia\n\n*S3 Graphics\n\n*Nvidia HOWTO (old).\n\n\nLatest version of OpenGL is OpenGL 4.5. To check your compatibility or for more information you can refer to this link -\nPlatform specifics: Linux\nIf you have OpenGL installed, you can get information about version that you are using by typing this command in terminal -\nglxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\"\n\nCompare both API\nI don't know much about DirectX but I can tell you advantages of using OpenGL-\n\n\n*\n\n*Although Microsoft has worked hard on DirectX 10 and 11 (latest version), and they're now as fast as OpenGL, and support almost as many features as it could yet OpenGL has faster draw calls than DirectX according to this link and it has first access to new GPU features via vendor extensions.\n\n*Since OpenGL is a cross-platform application, it runs efficiently on Mac, Linux and Windows.\n\n", "Q: Package was not found in the pkg-config search path I am trying to install WaoN.

The Ubuntu install is a bit gobbled up and has probably been broken beyond repair. The problem is this machine also probably has data on it that cannot be lost, but ATM, no one is here to figure out what needs to be backed up.\nI thought of simply copying the entire partition to a folder(?) on the bigger partition, but IDK if this will miss something important I should backup as well. I would like to be able to \"browse\" the backup data with the file manager/terminal if need be, but make room for a clean install on the original filesystem partition (if I'm not mistaken, sda3).\nIf anyone has any insight they can share, I would be very grateful.\nEDIT\nThe computer in question is a laptop, and I don't have means of adding other hard drive (no disk bay/external adapter available).\nAlso, there is no network storage or similar system deployed here ATM.\nAt most, I could grab a external USB drive and use it to backup everything, but I would prefer not to, as it is mine (not the company's) and I think it isn't in the best condition either.\n\nA: In your place I'd get a new empty drive (with enough space obviously) and dd over the whole disk (after creating a checksum for it) so that no data gets lost whatsoever and it remains provable.\nOf course the above only works if the drive isn't in use (isn't mounted), so you will need another system (which might be a liveUSB) to proceed with this approach.\nOtherwise just wait for someone in authority over the data and ask him/her how to proceed.\n\nA: I would get a new hard disk with a size just over 110Gb (it should cover the current \"used). Then add this disk to this system, format it and mount it on a directory aptly named. Like \"/backup\". Then move your data over to that disk, verify its content, remove this disk. Then reinstall, after you are satisfied with the system mount this backup disk and copy the data over that you need.\nEasier but a bit more expensive: get a new hard disk to replace this one (so as big as possible). Remove the current disk, install the new one, install OS and then mount the removed hard disk to a directory so you can copy your stuff over. Easier but more expensive. \n", "Q: Can't boot: \"mdadm: CREATE group disk not found\" After running apt-get upgrade yesterday and shutting down, I'm no longer able to boot Ubuntu 15.\nThe last several lines I see during boot are:\nBegin: Running /scripts/init-premount ... done.\nBegin: Mounting root file system ...

However, after a little while, I just get:\nmdadm: CREATE group disk not found\n\nThis message repeats ad infinitum and I'm not able to boot. Same with recovery mode.\nI found a few threads about this error, but no solution yet. What can I do to diagnose and fix this problem?\nThank you!\n\nA: This error is generated by the initramfs script that finds and mounts the root fs.\nI've experienced this message before and it turned out to be caused by updating the initramfs from a live cd.\nThe thing was that I had an encrypted root, and when opening the luks volume from the live cd I didn't use the same name that was in my crypttab.\nSo, I booted the live cd and did:\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md1 md1\nvgchange -ay\nmount /dev/vgmain/lvroot /mnt/custom\n<... mount dev et. al ...>\nchroot /mnt/custom\n<... fix something ...>\nupdate-initramfs -u\nexit\numount /mnt/custom && vgchange -an && cryptsetup luksClose md1\n\nThe update-initramfs -u did warn about cryptsetup: WARNING: invalid line in /etc/crypttab - but at first I didn't deem it important.\nAfter some failed attempts to boot it hit me: my crypttab had md1_crypt for the luks volume, but when I updated the initramfs it saw md1 so it went with that. From within the boot scripts md1 was not available as a luks volume.\nSo I booted my livecd again and corrected it:\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md1 md1_crypt\nvgchange -ay\nmount /dev/vgmain/lvroot /mnt/custom\n<... mount dev et. al ...>\nchroot /mnt/custom\nupdate-initramfs -u\nexit\numount /mnt/custom\nvgchange -an\ncryptsetup luksClose md1_crypt\n\nI've looked through the initramfs-tools scripts, but I couldn't find the exact spot where this went wrong, so I assume it was just some weird interaction between cryptsetup, mdadm and lvm.\nOn another debian host I had a similar issue*, except this time without crypttools or lvm involved, and I was able to work around it by changing my mdadm.conf from /dev/md/n device paths to /dev/mdn. On this ocassion, the issue only presented itself while the array was rebuilding and not when everything was normal. \nPerhaps someone more familiar with the inner workings of initramfs-tools can figure this out.\n* the debian host also showed a message like incrementally starting raid arrays after a few CREATE group disk not found.\n\nA: gnp's answer was pretty good and definitely pointed me in the right direction (my problem was caused by a broken cryptroot setup). However, it wasn't quite sufficient to debug the problem)\n\n\n*\n\n*This can be due to cryptsetup not mapping encrypted volume. This means that initramfs does not have and lvm volume to mount, if you are using and encrypted lvm physical group (the default encrypted ubuntu install)\n\n*For generally debugging this sort of problem, you want to understand initramfs and update-initramfs (google, then I would insert links by stackexchange won't let me)\n\n*To get more debugging output you can edit your boot options in grub (by pressing e over a valid option), you should remove the splash and quiet options. If this is not sufficient you can use break=premount as described here: https://wiki.debian.org/InitramfsDebug, to drop into an interactive shell and see what is going on. The script that was causing problems here was called cryptroot.\n\n*To understand what is going on in the generation of initramfs scripts, you can look at the files in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks and /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts, the former is run on a full working system to generate configuration for the latter. You might try adding set -x flags to these scripts for debugging.\n\n\nIn my particular case, I had problems correcting this from a boot disk with chroot because lvm tools where not returning the correct results inside the jail. I needed to mount in a number of things to work around this. I also had to ensure that the luks volume was mapped with the correct name (It needed to match up with the value in crypttab, and the helpful graphical interface was picking quite a bad name.\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md1 md1_crypt\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/encrypted-root/sys\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/encrypted-root/dev\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/encrypted-root/proc\nchroot /mnt/encrypted-root\nupdate-inintramfs -c -k all\n\n\nA: I believe it has to do with race conditions when mdadm builds disk arrays. You may have to play with delays in the pre-mount scripts to allow all the arrays to be built. I have set up a nested RAID for /boot because grub cannot deal with RAID10 and the second level mirror RAID1 does not get normally built by mdadm. So I have had to put mdadm --assemble /dev/md/boot into a pre-mount script.\nYour situation maybe different but I think my experience gives a clue.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio with locked channels don't work so well with media keys I got pulseaudio set to lock left and right channel together on the output device, but if I change volume with my media keys rapidly, the channels go out of sync, leaving one louder than the other. Is there another way I can force the channels to always be at the same volume?\n\nA: I am not sure if this would work, but maybe you could try assigning a keyboard shortcut to those same keys to change the volume. Below the first command lowers the volume 5%, the second one increases it 5%, and the third one toggles the mute button.  \namixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-\n\namixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+\n\namixer -D pulse sset Master toggle\n\n\nA: Here is a script I wrote to do this :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvol=$( amixer -D pulse get Master | grep \"Front Left:\" | cut -d[ -f2 | cut -d% -f1)\n\n#read argument\nif test $# -ge 1 && let $1\nthen\n    incr=$1\nelse\n    incr=\"3\"\n    echo \"Incrementing sound by $incr% (default).\"\nfi\n\necho \"Current volume : $vol - setting it to $(( $vol + $incr )).\"\n\n#set the sound to a flat value, and unmute it\namixer -D pulse sset Master $(( $vol + $incr ))% unmute > /dev/null\n\nSo instead of amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+ , you need to call that script : paste the text above in a file (eg. /home/yourname/volume ).\nThen you just need to make it executable (chmod 755 /home/yourname/volume) and you can replace your previous command with this one : /home/yourname/volume -5 (or +5, +3, -3...).\nIt should do exactly the same, except it unmutes the volume if it is muted.\n", "Q: Comparing multiple data files I have several files containing text data. I need each individual file to have only unique lines against all the other text files. For example, textfile1 has a line entry called \"foobar\", but so does textfile15. What is the best way to perform a comparison for uniqueness of the individual rows against multiple files?\n\nA: To find if all text files are unique: \ncat *.txt | wc -l ; cat *.txt | sort -u | wc -l\n\nIf the lines match they are unique. \nTo find what duplicates are present: \ncat *.txt | sort | uniq -d \n\nHere is a more complete scenario: \nI have songs downloaded.

I have Windows 10 and I want to install Ubuntu. I want to be able to make GRUB (eventually BURG) my default boot loader for Windows 10 on /dev/sda4 and Ubuntu on /dev/sda7. Should I install GRUB to /dev/sda or /dev/sda7 and just use F12 key on boot? \nFor Windows, I use Windows Bootloader (an EFI on /dev/sda2).\n\nA: You're confusing different things. There is a little bit of code in the MBR. The MBR is right at the beginning of your HDD and also stores other stuff like the partition table. However, the information which can be stored there is not enough to boot a modern computer, and the format of MBR doesn't allow for storing any more data there. The classical generic MBR only provides 446 Byte for this and the modern standard MBR even only 218 Byte. (There are others as well.)\nThis code then loads information from a partition. If you use grub, the information is loaded from a Linux partition, namely from [whatever partition]/boot/grub and takes up 6.9 MB on my machine. The code Windows puts into the MBR also needs to load more information information from a partition. It's a lot more information and Windows gives it its own partition. That's why you have a partition about 100 MB in size when your computer came with Windows.\nSo you need to install the bootloader to /dev/sda. The installation process then will take care of putting the data it can't store in the MBR into [whatever partition]/boot/grub. Don't install the bootloader to a partition.\n", "Q: How to I obtain the iso for Ubuntu for virtual box? I'm having trouble finding the ISO for my Ubuntu download.

fine, then I updated the kernel (and some other things, I guess), unplugged it, rebooted, and it didn't work any more. I tried booting up with the previous kernel, no joy. I've tried in another computer, where it also used to work (but it's been longer since I last tried there), and it's the same.\nNothing lights up in the device, and I'm suspecting there could be something wrong with it and not with the OS. Is there anything else I can do to find out what the problem is?\n\nA: Given that you've tried it on multiple computers and the lights on the adapter do not turn on when plugged in, it is almost definitely a hardware problem.\nFurthermore, the line usb 3-2: USB disconnect, device number 13 suggests the adapter is disconnecting or failing when the OS tries to turn on the radio. Since that message is from the USB driver, it's almost definitely a hardware problem on the adapter.\nIf you want to debug further you could try installing it on a Windows computer, but it sounds like the adapter is dead. Probably time to get a new one.\n", "Q: Which IP to use for localhost in Ubuntu virtual box- installing hadoop I am trying to install hadoop single node on a Ubuntu 14 Virtual machine( on VMWare) on a windows 7 host.\nOne of the steps says :\n\n\n*Get IP address using: \nifconfig   \n\nYou get xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  \n\n*Edit /etc/hosts file: \nsudo gedit /etc/hosts  \n\n\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx localhost\nwhich ip address should I use in localhost here? I have one ip being shown in the Ubuntu VM when I do ifconfig and when I do 'whats is my ip' from the windows host I get a different public IP.\nWhich IP should I use? Please let me know\nRegards\nShuvadeep\n\nA: You should not alter the /etc/hosts file to have localhost point at a different address than the one it already points to.\n\nA: localhost is a magic name, and EVERY computer uses this name, and its IP address of 127.0.0.1 to refer to \"This computer, right here, that I'm running on\". Changing the definition of 127.0.0.1 localhost will lead you so far into the weeds that you will never come back.  \nYour system gets its IP address from /etc/hosts if it has a \"static\" IP address. The IP address comes from a \"DHCP server\" if your system is configured to use DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  \nSince you are running Ubuntu \"inside\" a VM, it's probably using DHCP. In any case, ifconfig will show you the current IP address, and /etc/hosts contains the IP address that will be used at network startup, if a static IP is desired. So, the IP address to use is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, from ifconfig\n", "Q: Accessing a nameless folder via terminal I have a thumbdrive which I use to plug in at print shops to get my printing done. The first time it got infected by a Windows malware \"Gamarue\", I copied out files using Ubuntu and formatted it, no harm done. I head on down to an entirely different print shop, and it gets infected again with the same malware. :(\nAnyway, interesting question the malware hides your content in a \"nameless\" folder and to the unsuspecting user baits you into double clicking a .lnk file which, I assume, allows the malware to copy onto your computer. I couldn't see this nameless folder while in Windows.\nWhile using the file viewer in Ubuntu, I can see that there is a folder there with no name containing all my files. Now just for kicks, I decided to access this folder via terminal. All I need to do is to cd into /media, view the folder and copy out the folders if I desire right? Well nope...\n$ ls -l\ntotal 20\ndrwx------ 1 seelan seelan  4096 Sep 27 10:11 System Volume Information\n-rw------- 2 seelan seelan   817 Sep 27 10:11 Theia (30GB).lnk\ndrwx------ 1 seelan seelan 12288 Sep 27 10:11  \n\nTadaaaa a nameless folder/directory that I cannot access via terminal. How would I go about accessing this folder? Any ideas?\nEdit:\na little more research into it shows that the non-printing character is octal character 302 240. this was done by \"ls -l | od -c\" showing the octal character occupying the space. link states that \"The character-pair \\302\\240 is the \"NO-BREAK SPACE\" from UTF-8 encoding.\". Only issue now is you cannot rename files via terminal and you can't enter octal characters when copying the file or can you?\nAnswer Edit:\nConsidering it was a non-printing character, i looked for a way to change the encoding of the terminal, hopefully i could find a way to view the name of the folder. For some reason while attempting the various tutorials, i tried to cd into the folder using a variable substitution.\ncd $'\\302\\240'\n\nFurther looking things up on this webpage. i found out that this will expand single/multi escape octal characters into its relevant ascii/unicode character. Using the same concept you can make and remove the directory if you'd like.\n\nA: You can't have a file with an empty name. However, the name could be something you can't see. Like a space, a non-breaking space, a tab, a horizontal tab, or even a character which isn't even printable like a end of message character or an escape character.\nTo show this, I've just created a folder having a blank as its name and anther one having a non-braking space as its name.\n$ ls -l\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 christoph christoph 4096 Sep 30 22:02  \ndrwxrwxr-x 2 christoph christoph 4096 Sep 30 22:02  \n\nAs you can see, there is no obvious way of seeing which one is which (though the non-breaking space really is displayed (in your browser: just copy one of the lines, press ctrl + F to search for it, and only 1 result will be shown) but ls -l doesn't display all characters, so it's possible to make different folders with actually the same output line of ls -l).\nIf you're using any version of Ubuntu but 15.04, first execute this command:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\n\nThis will give you the entry Open in Terminal in the context menu of Nautilus. If it doesn't Nautilus has to be restarted, so simply log out and log in again. Ubuntu 15.04 already comes with this entry, so you don't need to install nautilus-open-terminal or you'll have the entry twice.\nThen you can use the opened terminal window to do whatever you want to do at this location.\nEdit: I assumed you wanted to open the location in a terminal. If you want to browse it and only have a terminal available, you can use a terminal file browser like Ranger. Here is a page showing you how to install and use it.\n\nA: The easy way is to just copy all your files without moving into the folder:\nfind /media -mindepth 2 -not -path '/media/System*' -exec cp -rt /new/dir {} +\n\nLet's break that down:\n\n\n*\n\n*find /media : searc in the directory /media\n\n*-mindepth 2 : only look for files or directories that are in a subdirectory of /media. This will ensure you skip things in /media itself. \n\n*-not -path '/media/System*' : exclude any files or directories whose path matches /media/System*. This will make find ignore anything in the /media/System Volume Information directory.\n\n*-exec cp -rt /new/dir {} : copy anything found to /new/dir.\n\n\nThat's it, your files have been copied and you don't need to cd into the weird name. \n\nJust for fun, to actually cd into this, you can try a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the -F option of ls, to annotate the type of item listed.That will add a / after each directory name:\n$ ls -lF media/\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct  1 02:09  /\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct  1 02:09 System Volume Information/\n\nNow, copy the characters you can't see, making sure you leave one space after the time, the rest will be your directory's name. Then, just paste that into the terminal, inside quotes:\ncd /media/\" \"/\n           ^----- this is the pasted character.\n\n\n*Assuming the directory's name is a space, you can do:\ncd /media/\" \"\n\n\n*If the name is another whitespace character(s), you can try matching it and cding that way:\nfor d in media/*; do [[ \"$d\" =~ /[[:blank:]]  ]] && cd \"$d\"; done  \n\n", "Q: Using a Fork Bomb to prevent interactive shell on root This question makes two assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*My root user's interactive shell runs bash\n\n*.bashrc is only called on interactive shells\nIf I append the generally known fork bomb (:(){ :|: & };: - do not run this!) to the end of root's .bashrc file, could this prevent somebody from accessing an interactive root shell when I don't want them to? Obviously not the best solution and something to do more for curiosity. I just want to know what people think of this.\nEdit: I know this is in no way useful. I was just curious.\n\nA: It would not do anything as any modern linux distro, Ubuntu included, has been patched so this fork bomb will not work (unless you change the default security settings).\nGo ahead, run it ;)\nSee:\nFork bomb protection not working : Amount of processes not limited\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/435690/does-linux-have-any-measures-to-protect-against-fork-bombs\nThese limits should already be set by default.\nAt any rate you can also do drastic things such as setting the root shell to /bin/false or what not.\nDoes not prevent people with physical access from having root access and may or may not prevent \nsudo /bin/bash\nsudo /bin/ksh\nsudo /bin/zsh\nsudo /bin/sh\n\n=)\n\nA: At least you'd know when someone did su - or the like: your server's dead.\nThat scheme sounds... extreme? stupid?\nIf you don't want an interactive root shell, add this to the top of root's .bashrc:\n[[ \"$-\" == *i* ]] && exit\n\n$- holds the shell option characters (-v, -x, etc) and it will contain a letter \"i\" if it's an interactive shell.\n\nA: That would be totally unuseful (aside from delaying the obtainment of the interactive root shell);\nProbably the first attempt to spawn an interactive root (bash) shell would fail, but since non-interactive (bash) shells don't source the user's .bashrc, it would take seconds to run sudo nano /root/.bashrc and remove the fork bomb (or, as muru points out, to run sudo nano /root/.profile and directly inhibit /root/.bashrc's sourcing) before the second attempt;\nNontheless, if this would have worked in general, just adding a fork bomb to /root/.bashrc still wouldn't have covered interactive root (sh) sessions (and any non-preinstalled shell's interactive root session): for one, sudo /bin/sh will still spawn a working interactive sh root shell regardless of /root/.bashrc containing a fork bomb.\n", "Q: Installing Lubuntu on Asus EEE I have an old Asus EEE Netbook with 512 MB RAM and 4GB internal harddisk.

You will have to move the flash drive (which is under hard drive) ahead of your internal hard drive.  Then just save and continue with the boot.

When it's at it's worst, even typing causes it to flicker and the screen will go completely black. \nWhat I've tried:\nI have two graphics cards installed, but switching between them (using AMD Catalyst Control Center) does not help. The problem also persists when booting into my Windows 8 partition. Restarting the computer sometimes helps temporarily. The display does not seem to be affected at all by jiggling or tapping.

Same reason the gateway didn't work.\n\nA: You need to configure /etc/network/interfaces:\nThere should be, in that file, the following lines in this order:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.146\n    netmask 255.255.255.10\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nThat way eth0 will gain a static IP instead of the default DHCP address.\n", "Q: Split text file into several ones when pattern appears, with command line in linux I want to split a text file into several ones.\nOne new file every time the pattern appears.\nExample:\nThe pattern will be PAT\nOriginal file content:\nPAT --example html http://askubuntu.com/page01\nABC\nDEF\n\nPAT --example html http://askubuntu.com/page02\nGHI\nJKL\n\nPAT --example html http://askubuntu.com/page03\nMNO\nPQR\n\n(and so on)\nThe original file is called original.txt\nI would like to get files like so:\n$ cat page01.txt\nABC\nDEF\n$ cat page02.txt\nGHI\nJKL\n$ cat page03.txt\nMNO\nPQR\n\n(and so on)\nIdeally with commands like grep, awk...\nThe renaming of the files is secondary, but would be a plus to help classifying them.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You could use awk with some redirection:\nawk -F/ '/^PAT/{close(file);file = $NF; next} /./{print >> file}' foo\n\nThe result:\n$ head page0*\n==> page01 <==\nABC\nDEF    \n\n==> page02 <==\nGHI\nJKL    \n\n==> page03 <==\nMNO\nPQR\n\nEssentially, for each line beginning with PAT, I'm saving the last field (via a field separator of /) the variable file, and then printing every non-empty line (/./ matches lines with at least one character) to the name contained in file.\nNote that it's important to close the previous file at each loop to prevent a \"makes too many open files\" error when there's \"a lot\" of file created.\n\nA: Since @muru beat me to the awk solution, here's a Perl approach (but use @Muru's instead, it is simpler and more efficient):\nperl -00ne 's#PAT.*/(.*)\\n##; open($F,\">\",\"$1.txt\"); s/\\n\\s*(\\n|$)//g; \n            print $F \"$_\\n\"' original.txt \n\nThe -00 makes perl treat paragraphs as lines: a \"line\" (a \"record\") is now a paragraph, defined by an empty line. s#PAT.*/(.*)\\n## will remove the line starting with PAT from the record, and the parentheses capture the last word after the / as $1.Then, we open $1.txt for writing (open($F,\">\",\"$1.txt\")) with the file handle $F. The next step, s/\\n\\s*\\n//g; removes blank lines and, finally, the current record is printed to the filehandle $F with print $F \"$_\\n\".\n\nTo use everything after the // as a name, try:\nperl -00ne 's#PAT.*//(.*)\\n##; $k=$1; $k=~s#[./]##g;open($F,\">\",\"$k.txt\"); \n              s/\\n\\s*(\\n|$)//g; print $F \"$_\\n\"' original.txt \n\nOn your example, that would result in the following files:\naskubuntucompage01.txt\naskubuntucompage02.txt\naskubuntucompage03.txt\n\n\nA: Also have a look at csplit(1):\ncsplit --suppress-matched --prefix page --suffix-format %02d.txt original.txt '/^PAT/' '{*}'\n\nSplits file orginal.txt into separate files when regex pattern found.\npage00.txt\npage01.txt\n...\n\n", "Q: Installing package from 3d-party repository I need to install package from a non-ppa repository.

(US) via E-mail 02/02/2016 04:38 PM\nDear Walt,\nThank you for contacting TomTom Customer Support regarding your TomTom VIA device. My name is XXXXXX and I will be assisting you today.\nThe reference number for your query is ######-######.\nDue to higher than normal email volume, we apologize for the delay in responding to your query. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\nWalt, as I understand from your email you want to know if you can update the device on a LINUX operating system. I’m glad that you emailed us and I will provide you with more information.\nI am sorry to inform you that the application MyDrive Connect is only supported for Windows and Mac operating systems and unfortunately we are unable to provide support for Linux based operating systems. I will pass on this feedback to our concerned team so that TomTom could support even the Linux based operating systems.\n\nAnd, he sent me a link to a \"these are the versions of Windows and MacOS we support\" page, asserting it was \"more information on MyDrive compatibility.\", and expressing the hope that it would be \"helpful\". Since TomTom GPS run embedded Linux, I'm puzzled.\nI guess the only way I can recover from my mistaken purchase is to instantiate a virtual machine, and get Windows to run there. Makes me feel dirty (and stupid). \n\nA: To TS: Your Tomtom VIA 1500 is running navcore version newer then 9.  Navcore is the OS/GUI image that Tomtom uses. Older TomToms (XL, GO, etc) were using older Navcore, which, when connected into a PC, would reboot, and present itself as a USB disk.  \nDevices that run navcore 10+ now run OS all the time, and when connected to PC, present themselves as an Ethernet over USB device (which is clearly what your device does as well).  Update is performed by establishing a TCP/IP session to a device (most likely using SSL encryption, I have not investigated much).  Generally, Tomtom device runs a DHCP server, and has an IP 169.254.255.1, and serves up IP 169.254.255.2/30 to the computer. \nIf you configured networking over USB correctly, you should be able to access the http server on your Tomtom VIA by using the URL http://169.254.255.1/pcmi/?locale=en_gb\nThere is no known (to me) way to downgrade navcore in TomTom VIA devices down to 9.x. \nHTH\n", "Q: sudo: unable to change to root gid \nRunning sudo <command> failed with:\n\nsudo: unable to change to root gid\n\n\nA: Nothing wrong here: a GUEST account does not have \"sudo\" permissions.\nYou need to log out and use the admin account to do what you want to do.\n\nA: Most installations of programs require the sudo command that gives admin permissions.

There maybe  read errors, or other related hardware issues, which Linux will deal with by disabling the device. Windows, will allow you to write the the device until it is totally destroyed.  You can find the device number by using lsusb, while the device is plugged in.  once you have the device ID: see photo:\n \nYou're going to search /var/log/syslog to try and figure out what is causing your hardware to not work. You can do this by doing $cat /var/log/syslog | grep \"ID Number\" \nyou could use the number in dmesg, to get you in the vicinity. Other messages may share that number, 6444 in your first example. You might want to look to see if something is failing just prior to being initialized. \nIt might be helpful to update your question with lsub output. \n", "Q: Downloading Ubuntu 15.04 on an Acer Chromebook C720 and Stuck at this screen I have an Acer Chromebook C720. I was kinda fed up with the Chrome OS so I decided to try downloading a different OS, and my friends told me that Ubuntu could be easily installed. I searched up the instructions, had no problem following them until after I finished the installation process, had it all installed, it opened a loading screen, and popped me to the Ubuntu 15.04 chrubuntu tty1 startup page. There I tried to login. The set of instructions I used told me to use user as my username as well as my password. As soon as I did that, I got a long block of text, but I haven't figured how to actually boot up the operating system and use my computer. It's giving me an option to type in a command, but even after searching the web, I haven't found anything that I can do. I still have the option to go back to the Chrome OS but I'd rather not. Any suggestions as to what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: I've had this same issue as well. One of my colleagues noted that some of the text said there was a read only file that could not be written to, and also said that it might be that whatever user was not allowed to write to the Chrubuntu partition. Did you also happen to get strange questions in the installation process on driver packages that seemed to have been recently patched, or something along those lines? I don't quite remember what it said but I know the default answer was no.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with thinkpad T420 graphic hardware? I am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and I'm trying to upgrade to 14.04 LTS, it tells me \"Your graphics hardware may not be fully supported in Ubuntu 14.04\". My output using lspci | grep VGA gives the following:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF119M [Quadro NVS 4200M] (rev a1)\n\nIs it because that my NVIDIA hardware is really not suitable for 14.04, or is it due to some improper configurations that has made the system ignored my NVIDIA graphic card and could only see my integrated graphics card instead?

IGBE is the network card, so it doesn't seem relevant to your problem. I don't know what EXP3 is but it doesn't matter because it's disabled. This leaves us with XHCI and EHCI. These two are the USB hubs (one is USB 2.0 the other 3.0).\nTo disable wakeup from any USB device, just add the following to /etc/rc.local:\necho \"XHCI\" > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho \"EHC1\" > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nYou can also execute the commands as root and then put the laptop to sleep and see if it stops from waking up by itself.

You won't be giving an application with read/write capabilities control at that level for a simple permissions issue. There are exploits that will take advantage of this\n\nA: In ubuntu (and Linux in general) even though you are the admin of the machine, you do not get the super user permissions. This is a security feature, because that way programs that run do not have permissions to change your system or install other (malicious) programs. You can request these permissions in the terminal by using sudo. If you type sudo and than the command you want to perform this command has super user permissions and if you run a program with sudo it gets these permissions as well. You need to be carefull with running programs with sudo, these programs could misuse these permissions. \nyou can delete the directory without running nautilus as root as suggested by Miphix. Now you use the therminal. first go to the folder that contains the folder you want to remove: cd /[path to folder]. Now if you run ls to see the content of this folder, it should include the folder you want to remove. now run sudo rm -rf [foldername] to remove it. \nrm -rf is not without danger, if you where to run sudo rm -rf / you would delete your whole file system.

And I have no idea how to solve it.\n\nA: This is what can be tried in a situation like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running alsamixer in a terminal and see if there is an output that is muted;\n\n*Checking if the jack is wired correctly to the sound card;\n\n*Fiddling with hda-jack-retask, which can reroute sound pins on some cards. If this ends up the solution, maybe a bug should be reported in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu\n(summarized from my comments above)\n", "Q: What is this in my /var/sys/syslog Oct  1 13:17:01 tilaprimera /USR/SBIN/CRON[5710]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\n\nA: There is a background task scheduler named cron that runs tasks at specific times. \nThe log entry you see in syslog is the cron daemon running its hourly tasks.\nrun-parts is a utility to run executables in a directory.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: One bad sector is not a problem at all. Keep an eye on it, so check regularly.\nWhen it starts increasing dramatically in a short time the disk may fail soon.\nThe system marks bad sectors as unusable - fixing bad sectors is impossible.\nHowever you can continue to using your disk at the current status of health.\n\nA: A single bad sector may be entirely harmless and the drive may happily run with it for years.\nBut especially if you had experienced an issue with that drive it can also be a first sign of a dying drive. As it is an external drive you presumably use for backups I would not take this lightly. You need to find out about the cause of this warning.\nPlease do run a thorough self test on that drive to read out its SMART data. They will give you valuable additional information. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to run a checkdisk?\n\n*How can I check the health of my hard drive?\nThings to be worried about are:\n\n\n*\n\n*too many reallocated sectors indicate that the drive's firmware will no longer be able to reallocate and hide bad sectors to a reserved area of that drive.\n\n*growing numbers of bad sectors over time indicate that your drive has an issue and it will fail in the near future.\n\n\nFrom what we can see there are not too many data on that drive.

Is it due to newer version? since the solution was last tested on version 10.04.\n\nA: General warning in advance: do not manually change the cryptsetup parameters with options like -c (--cipher), -s (--key-size) and -h (--hash). The defaults are generally sane enough and unless you know what you are doing, you might actually select worse parameters.\nThese defaults are shown with cryptsetup --help. For reference, on Ubuntu 16.04 with cryptsetup 1.7.2, the defaults are:\n\nLUKS1: aes-xts-plain64, Key: 256 bits, LUKS header hashing: sha1, RNG: /dev/urandom\n\nOn Arch Linux with cryptsetup 1.7.2, the defaults are:\n\nLUKS1: aes-xts-plain64, Key: 256 bits, LUKS header hashing: sha256, RNG: /dev/urandom\n\n\nThe instructions you linked were written for a Ubuntu version released in 2010. Nowadays (and maybe even back then) you do not have to manually load kernel modules in order to setup full disk encryption. These are automatically loaded when cryptsetup is invoked.\nIn the context of Linux kernel modules, the aes name is a module name and alias for several possible implementations. There is one generic aes module which is built into the kernel image. Then there are alternative, faster implementation which depend on some hardware or CPU capabilities (like padlock-aes and aesni-intel).\nEven if these hardware-accelerated modules cannot be loaded, there is still the fallback to the generic AES implementation which is why cryptsetup can still use it.\nTo confirm that AES256 encryption is indeed in use, you can use the cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb1 command which shows something like:\n...                                        \nCipher name:    aes\nCipher mode:    xts-plain64\nHash spec:      sha256\nPayload offset: 4096\nMK bits:        256\n\nHere you can see that the AES cipher was used using the SHA256 hash function for password derivation. The key size is 256 bits (so you are indeed using AES256).\nFor your last question (why you do not have an /etc/modprobe/aliases file), this file does not exist in recent Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: How to get the list of installed packages without dependencies?

That will not tell exactly what you selected, but that does not depend on your log files (which might have been rotated).\nInstalling packages listed as root packages will install all the packages listed in children packages. So you should end up with almost (see drawbacks below) the same packages list.\nThe children list will shows the packages that are dependencies of other children packages or root packages.\nThere are some drawbacks with this approach:\n\n*\n\n*Some packages might not be listed as root when they are dependencies of some optional, recommended package you selected. For example, on my server apache2 is listed in children packages because I also have libapache2-mod-php, libapache2-mpm-itk and python-letsencrypt-apache installed which have apache2 as a dependency.\n\n*Cyclic dependencies (packages that directly or indirectly depends on each others) will be listed in Children packages (for example: libapache2-mod-php and libapache2-mod-php7.0). There is a section listing the probable cycle (check the package ancestries for 5 generations), you should include it to have the same list of packages (unless I've overlooked something else).\n\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nclass ListRootPackages\n  def run\n    count = manual_marked_packages.count\n    @dependencies ||= {}\n\n    @root_packages ||= begin\n      manual_marked_packages.each_with_index.map do |package, index|\n        STDERR.print \"   #{index + 1} / #{count} \\r\"\n\n        intersection = manual_marked_packages & reverse_dependencies(package)\n\n        if intersection.any?\n          @dependencies[package] = intersection\n          nil\n        else\n          package\n        end\n      end.compact\n    end\n  end\n\n  def potential_cyclic_dependences\n    run\n\n    @potential_cyclic_dependences ||= @dependencies.keys.map do |package|\n      package unless has_root_ancestor?(package, 5)\n    end.compact\n  end\n\n  def has_root_ancestor?(package, level=0)\n    return true if @root_packages.include?(package)\n    return false if level.zero?\n\n    @dependencies[package].any? { |parent| has_root_ancestor?(parent, level - 1) }\n  end\n\n  def root_packages\n    run\n    @root_packages\n  end\n\n  def dependencies\n    run\n    @dependencies\n  end\n\n  def manual_marked_packages\n    @manual_marked_packages ||= parse_cli_list(`apt-mark showmanual`)\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def reverse_dependencies(package)\n    parse_cli_list(`apt-cache rdepends #{package}`)[2..-1]\n  end\n\n  def parse_cli_list(list)\n    list.split(\"\\n\").map(&:strip)\n  end\nend\n\nlist = ListRootPackages.new\nlist.run\n\nputs \"===== Root Packages (#{list.root_packages.count}) =====\"\nputs list.root_packages.join(\"\\n\")\nputs\n\nputs \"===== Children packages (#{list.dependencies.count}) =====\"\nputs list.dependencies.map { |package, parents| \"#{package}: #{parents.join(', ')}\" }.join(\"\\n\")\nputs\n\nputs \"===== Potential cyclic dependencies (#{list.potential_cyclic_dependences.count}) =====\"\nputs list.potential_cyclic_dependences.join(\", \")\n\nif somebody wants to convert that to Bash or Python, that would be nice since Ruby is less commonly installed on servers than Bash or Python.\n\nA: This command will give a list of manually installed packages, as well as those where their \"automatically installed\" reverse dependencies has been removed (for instance, if you remove the ubuntu-server metapackage, its dependencies will no longer be marked automatic, and will now be on this list):\napt list --installed | grep -v automatic\n\nIn other words, the above list will return all packages with either no reverse dependencies, or where they are also marked as manually installed.\n", "Q: sudo: Forcing Primary Group to 'Domain Users' for [username] I have been setting up an ubuntu server and at some point this started to happen:\nEvery time I sudo and am prompted for a password I get this:\nsudo echo \"test\"\n[sudo] password for [username]:\nForcing Primary Group to 'Domain Users' for [username]\nForcing Primary Group to 'Domain Users' for [username]\ntest\n\nI have a feeling it might have to do something with samba, but I am not sure, and googling hasn't showed me anything definite.\n\nA: I saw this exact same problem arise on our Ubuntu server.  You are exactly correct.  The answer lies with Samba.  That particular message seems to be printing out because the Samba debug level is set too high.  Because Samba integrates with pam for authentication, it shows up at sudo and su prompts, as they also use pam to authenticate.\nThe relevant line in smb.conf is:\ndebug level = n\n\nwhere n is a number from 0 to 10.  If you're using Webmin, it's in miscellaneous options. (Edit: it was called log level in my smb.conf).\nWe had our debug set to 3 when we were testing today.  Setting it back to 0 resolved the issue.\nI did some testing, and the highest that the debug can be without seeing the message seems to be 2\n\nAlso, I ran into the same issue with Google.

If -f is not given, and when not running in the background, gzip\n          prompts to verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.\n\n\nA: I think the answer given here by kos is the best way I've seen so far.\nThough as Software Center uses apt, anything that it has installed would be listed too.\nThe command is:\nzcat /var/log/apt/history.log.*.gz | cat - /var/log/apt/history.log | grep -Po '^Commandline: apt-get install (?!.*--reinstall)\\K.*'\n\n\nA: Here is script which prints only the currently installed top level packages, where \"top level packages\" is defined as atp packages upon which no other atp packages depend.  If such top level programs were installed by atp or a package manager such as synaptic, then they were manually chosen by the user.\n#!/bin/sh\nNumDaysAgo=18\nfind /var/lib/dpkg/info -name \"*.list\" -mtime -$NumDaysAgo \\\n    -exec stat -c $'%y\\t%n' {} \\; | \\\nsed -e 's,/var/lib/dpkg/info/,,' -e 's,\\.list,,' | \\\nsort -r | \\\nwhile read Date Time Xxx Pkg\ndo \n    lncnt=$(apt-cache --installed rdepends $Pkg | wc -l)\n    if [ $lncnt -eq \"2\" ]\n        then echo \"$Date $Time $Pkg\"\n    fi\ndone\necho \"JOB COMPLETED: $BASH_SOURCE\"\n\nThe packages are printed in reverse order under the assumption that the user is more likely to want the newer info sooner, and because the program is slow.\nProgram flow:\n\n\n*\n\n*The program first gathers into a list all the installed packages by reading the filenames under /var/lib/dpkg/info/.  The file mod times are the installation times.\n\n*That list is sorted in reverse order. \n\n*For each installed package $Pkg, a call to apt-cache rdepends $Pkg\nrequests the reverse-dependencies of $Pkg.  If there are no dependencies, then it is a top level package and the package info is printed: date time packagename\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*The script depends upon the output format of apt-cache rdepends $Pkg which was intended for human eyes and could change in the future versions of apt.\n\n*The code for the part gathering filenames under /var/lib/dpkg/info/ came from \nthis unix.stackexchange post. As that poster 'mikel' pointed out, the dpgk history logfiles are not reliable because they will be rotated out after reaching a certain volume.\n\n*Man page for \napt-chache\n\n*The call apt-cache rdepends ... is very slow presumably because each call is computed by  iterating through all the dependencies.  Hence the above script starts from the newest installs to offer the user as much instant gratification as possible. \n\n*The --installed flag after apt-cache checks that the dpkg-installed packages are also apt-installed.  If the user or another install software bypassed apt and used dpkg directly, it would be possible.  THIS CASE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, but I think something noticeable would be printed in either the standard or error output\n\n*The output does not include manually chosen packages which later became  depended upon by a higher package.  The output can also include packages which were installed via apt by other third party install software, and hence are not truly manually installed.  However, if the purpose of the output is as a basis for setting up a restored linux from a backup /home directory which included said third party software, then this output would be suitable.\n\n*Some of the package names include version numbers, and some not.

I connect with VPNC and get the message:\nVPN connection was successfully established.\nand a lock in the WiFi icon in the upper-right corner of Ubuntu Desktop appears.\nHow to check that VPNC really works?\n\nMore about this problem:\nI've just got a new laptop and installed Ubuntu 14.04 and all its updates. Before installing/configuring anything else, I tried to ssh to our local server secured with VPNC. I just installed VPNC following these steps: which really installs the package called network-manager-vpnc. Then I establish VPNC connection, and get the message about the success and the lock on the WiFi icon.\nThen I try to ssh to the server. But I get an error, which is the same as if VPNC was not on:\nssh: connect to host “xxx” port 22: Connection timed out\n\nIt seems to me that the lock signals a functioning VPNC, but the VPNC actually does not work.\nNote that: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I try to establish the VPNC connection (by clicking on the WiFi icon,\nthen VPN Connections, and then on 'Some of My VPNC Connection Names') nothing\nhappens. I need to try several times before the WiFi icon starts\nflashing. The flashing is then reliably followed be the appearance of the\nlock, which remains there and does not go. But, again, to get it\nflashing may take several attempts.\n\n*I tried two installations of Ubuntu 14.04 on two different laptops (3\nlaptops in total). The were installed from different USB sticks/CDs\nand downloaded and created at different times. The problem is the\nsame on all laptops: Connection timed out.\n\n*Also I tried another two laptops of my colleague, both running Ubuntu\n14.04. I could ssh via VPNC without any problems using my details. More on that is\nhere.\n\n\nA: I have fixed the problem by only connecting via vpnc and not using network-manager-vpnc. Look at the reply by seedkhan here or my reply here. The fact that vpnc works but not with network-manager-vpnc on a freshly installed ubuntu suggests that there may be a bug in network-manager-vpnc.\n\nA: You can check by running ifconfig and checking for VPN related entries (usually tun0 or pptp0 or something similar). Alternatively, there are a number of websites which will display your IP address as they see it, e.g. google. Switch the VPN connection on & off, and check whether the address changes.\n(See also my related question and a bug which has similar symptoms.

I had Eclipse installed from apt-get, but I needed Mars version so I followed this guide, but I forgot to remove the older version first. If a new version comes out in the repository, will it revert back the version of Eclipse I installed in Unity / desktop. In alternative, if I remove through apt-get, will it delete the links I created? What about dependencies?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: As always, it depends. This is one of the potential problems when installing from source, the names and locations of libraries and binaries can conflict between apt (apt-get) and sudo make install\nThere are 2 general solutions:\nFirst - Installing source code into /usr/local - minimizes conflicts with system files in /usr\nThis is what I generally do \n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nSecond - Probably better, use check install\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n./configure\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nThis makes a .deb from your source code and thus works better with apt. The package can then be installed and removed similar to any other .deb.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo\nYou would then put the package on hold\nsee How to prevent updating of a specific package?\nand then update the package, manually downloading the source code and re-compiling (with checkinstall) or taking it off hold and using the ubuntu repositories (apt).\nNote: IMO installing into /usr/local is LEAST likely to result in problems with system files as it is cleaner (keeps the source files and system files completely separate). checkinstall is very relilable, but, if there is a conflict you can break the system.\n\nA: The Eclipse version in the repositories is old, make a clean cut:\nRemove the package via\nsudo apt-get remove eclipse\n\nand remove your installation in /opt. After that, install Eclipse Mars again. Use the new Eclipse Installer.\n", "Q: How to add a prefix ou suffix to files dowloaded via uGet on Ubuntu 14.04 I've been using uGet to download files from sites for some days.\nMy question is simple :\nIs there a way to add a prefix - suffix to files downloaded.\nI noticed the field where you can specify a filename but this does not fulfill what I want to do.\nHelp would be greatly appreciated.\nLaurent06000\n\nA: You shouldn't need to specify a prefix or suffix.

The database is packed inside a CVD file and distributed\n  through our mirror network. This feature is disabled by default on all\n  installations and should be enabled with extreme care.\nAll signatures provided by Google Safe Browsing Database will be\n  prefixed with the Safebrowsing tag. If ClamAV reports\n  Safebrowsing. FOUND, it means that the advisory was\n  provided by Google and not by ClamAV Virus database.\nPlease note that such reports DO NOT necessarily mean that the data\n  scanned contains some malware.

This\n             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,\n             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a \nconnection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over\n             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port\n             hostport from the remote machine.

Ever since then mysql has been messed up. The issue I'm having is that I cannot login to the root user. I think that I may have accidentally skipped the part where I add the password for that user.\nThings I've Tried\nFrom what I understand, I need to stop mysql and start it in safe mode so I do not need to enter a password.\nI have used set password for root@localhost\nWhen logged in with the root user in mysql safe mode I tried set password with no user specified, thinking this would edit the current user's password.\nAfter I change the password and restart the mysql server it seems that nothing has been changed.\nI have also tried logging into phpmyadmin in safemode and creating another user with all privileges. When safe mode is disabled, these changes are non-existant.\nAll of my attempts have been made from a remote location.\nAt this point in time I'm starting to think that I should just reinstall mysql completely so that it can possibly be reset. Should I just restart from scratch? Or shall I give it another try? I think that if I cannot get it to work I will just wipe the server and start again with an open source control panel.\nThanks!\n\nA: There is some missing information here in order to get you where you need to be. If you restarted MySQL in safe mode, did you change the password for the root user? Is there multiple root users in the user table? For instance you may have root@localhost, root@%, root@.\nOnce you make changes to the user table you need to FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nIf you don't your changes (ie. password being updated) will not be reflected.\nIf your my.cnf (MySQL config file) has the server limited to localhost access only, you will not be allowed to access MySQL from outside the server, so if for instance your PHPMyAdmin is running on another machine, this will not be allowed. Cartain config changes may require you to restart MySQL as well, so try taking a look at what I have mentioned here and see if it helps, otherwise provide some more info so that we can help you further.\n", "Q: How to Migrate Physical 12.04 Machine into LXC Is there a standard way (or standard tools) to migrate physical machines into LXC containers for Ubuntu?

Another idea I had was to create an ubuntu container from a template and then copy over that file system. I bet plenty of /etc would be wrongfully clobbered though.\n\nA: Since I posted this question I have done this process half a dozen times without too much trouble.

Exclude /proc, /dev, /sys and /tmp.\nAfterwards:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make fstab empty in the container\n\n*Ensure a minimal set of device files under /dev. I copy the device files from a sample container that I created using a template.\n\n*If you are going to use lxcbr0 for networking, set the network interface to DHCP in /etc/network/interfaces\n\n*If you are going to bridge to a physical interface, set the interface to\nstatic or manual. If manual, put the IP address in the container's config. Do not set to DHCP.\n\n*be sure you set a hwaddr in your container config. If you don't LXC will randomly generate one when the container loads causing a lot of stale ARP entries on your network.\n\n*read through /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-ubuntu. Pay special attention to the configure_ubuntu() function. You probably want to run most of those commands in your container.\n\n\nAfter the container is up, go through all the processes in pstree, removing those that aren't needed in containers (udevd, ntpdate, mdadm, etc). Feel free to remove all kernel packages.\nHere is a sample container configuration for completeness. This configuration is for a trusty host. The container in this instance is precise.\nlxc.include = /usr/share/lxc/config/ubuntu.common.conf\nlxc.start.auto=1\nlxc.rootfs = /var/lib/lxc/myhost/rootfs\nlxc.mount = /var/lib/lxc/myhost/fstab\nlxc.utsname = myhost\nlxc.arch = amd64\n\n# Network configuration\nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = br0\nlxc.network.ipv4 = 172.27.3.13/24\nlxc.network.ipv4 = 172.27.3.15/24\nlxc.network.ipv4.gateway = 172.27.3.1\nlxc.network.hwaddr = 52:12:a1:a5:d3:23\n\nIf the host OS is precise, you'll want this in your config as well.

I want to make it a file server so that people on my LAN can upload files onto it or download files. Should I use FTP to do so, or should I avoid opening another port by just using SSHFS? Another way to word this is, what are the benefits of FTP over SSHFS?\n\nA: Really, go with SSHFS.  All you need to do is set up a guest account and password that can be SSH'd into.  Then users can upload anything they want into a folder on the server.  FTP is much less secure, and is easier to hack/be hacked.  I would go with SSHFS.

I presume the purpose of this is in the case that I ever want Windows 10 back. The thing is I'm already familiar with Ubuntu (computers at my university have it installed) and I can't think of a scenario in which I'd want Windows back, or a scenario in which I'd want to dual-boot. What is your recommendation? \nIn the case that I decide to do the bootable USB drive, what would be a proposed step-by-step guide for me to accomplish it? Buy USB drive and follow guide on the Windows website?\nIn the case I choose to forego the bootable USB drive, is there anything I should keep in mind?\n\n*I keep hearing the word partition, what does this mean? I'm fairly certain I don't want to share my disk drive with Windows, would a partition apply to my scenario?\n\n*Lastly, I don't know if this is the right place to ask and excuse me (or direct me) if it's not the right place, but prior to the loss of my MacBook (water damage incident), I had all my files backed up on a Seagate external hard drive. How would I go about migrating my files to this laptop? Are there any special considerations since the backups were done by Time Machine on the Mac OS? Noobiest of all, every time I plug the hard drive into my laptop it doesn't seem to detect it?\n\n*Bonus question. In the case of the bootable USB drive, would I be able to perform the backup of Windows on my external hard drive?\nI apologize for my extreme lack of knowledge, I'm feeling rather lost so any answers/clarifications are greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: Is there anything I should keep in mind to ensure the installation runs as smoothly as possible? Will I need to have a Ubuntu on a disk to install it? \n\nA: *\n\n*You can get a bootable USB drive by using software like Pendrivelinux\nIt would basically act like a normal bootable CD, although I don't have much knowledge about bootable USB's since I've never used them.\n\n\n*A partition is essentially a part of your harddrive. For example, you have a 500gb harddrive,and you want to dualboot Windows and another OS, you can create 2 or more partitions both with 250gb, so then Windows would have 250gb (in terms of installing and saving files) and the other OS would also have 250gb. For more info check this link.\n\n\n3.Sorry, but I don't have much knowledge with backing files up either.\n4.I think you can if you make a different partition for that.\n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu sofdelg!\nYour questions seem totally legitimate to me, so I'll answer them.\n1: Having a bootable Windows backup is only useful to be able to rollback to Windows should you decide that you don't like Ubuntu or it won't run for some reason on your machine. (Bleeding edge hardware has a tendency of not working properly with stable releases. Tough based on the specs of the Lenovo ThinkPad e550 I don't think you'll run into this sort of problem.)\nSo basically having a rescue disk can be handy, but honestly I've never used a Windows disk for this purpose as I have a strong dislike (resentment?) towards that OS.\nStill if you wish to use Windows for this purpose then this guide seems to do that.\nA neat thing that some people seem to miss is the fact that you will likely install your Ubuntu from live media, and since that is also a self-contained system that can be booted it can be used for various repair purposes as long as you don't care about other OSes.\n2: You might already be familiar with the concept of a \"C: drive\". This is in fact a misnomer as what people refer as c: is a partition on the disk.\nNow don't get me wrong this isn't just a Windows thing, quite the opposite actually. A partition is basically just a piece of disk that you can mark with a \"file-system type\". For example on one of my disks the partition table looks like this:\nDisk /dev/sda: 465.8 GiB, 500107862016 bytes, 976773168 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0x000db12c\n\nDevice     Boot  Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *      2048    295016    292969 143.1M 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2       393214 976771071 976377858 465.6G  5 Extended\n/dev/sda5       393216 976771071 976377856 465.6G 83 Linux\n\nBasically the whole partition table is just a table at the start of the disk (after the main boot record), that indicates that which partitions starts where, how big they are, what type they have and whether they are bootable or not. If you wish to know more about this topic then this Wikipedia article seems to explain things excellently.\nThe gist of this is that yes, they do apply to you, but you (probably) won't have to worry about them as the installer can auto-create them for you, just pick something like \"Use the whole disk\" when that menu comes up. (Though you can have a lot of !!FUN!! by customizing stuff there.)\n3: While this would be (probably) better suited as a stand-alone question, I'll answer it here as it's related to the previous question.\nSo by now you know that partitions have a type and that this type indicates their intended use. (Eg. the Linux in my above example means that said partition is intended to be mounted somewhere on /and is formatted with a Linux file-system - in this case ext4.)\nSimilar to the above your backups from the Mac reside on a disk that has been partitioned and formatted in a way that Windows (and even Linux) doesn't understand without additional drivers. According this Wikipedia article that file-system would be HFS+.\nThe good news is that Linux does have drivers to access your backups, and the procedure to mount it has even been asked here on AskUbuntu which I recommend you read through.\n4: I believe trying to \"back-up\" Windows will likely format/overwrite/corrupt the drive and as such you will lose the things backed up from your Mac.\nI can't recommend it unless you are entirely sure you don't need that data anymore.\n\nI hope I managed to clear up some doubts you had.\n", "Q: 14.04 Dash Home won't load I just installed 14.04 and when I click on the dash home, nothing displays.

Not all external drive announce themselves as such. If Windows believes, that the external drive is a regular hard drive, it will list all partitions anyhow.\nHere's how I did it on my USB flash drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-partition your external drive (e. g. with GParted):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the first (and only) partition on your external drive or delete it and create a smaller one in its stead. Leave enough space after its end for Ubuntu (1.5 GB should be enough, if you just want a plain live system that doesn't retain changes between boots). You can put whatever you want on this partition, since it's irrelevant for the Ubuntu live system, that you're going to install later on.\n\n*Create a second partition for Ubuntu. If you don't need to access it with Windows, you can format it with ext4 instead of FAT32.\n\n\n*Install UNetbootin and run it. It will ask for a password for super-user privileges.\n\n*Select the correct disk image for the Ubuntu live system installation, set the drive type to “USB drive” and select the 2nd partition on it as the drive (here: /dev/sdg2). Note the 2 at the end of the device name. If you have more partitions on the drive, you can select those too, as long as they're not the first.\n\n\n*Click the OK button and let UNetbootin do its job.\n", "Q: Have I killed my Ubuntu 14.04.3 trying to recover password and get Grub to work? Been happy Ubuntu convert since late 2013 when paid to ditch Win8 and install Ubuntu.

If you select \"Move to Trash\" and don't immediately then empty the Trash folder, chances are that your USB will show up as not being empty at all. Will look like it, but not register as being empty when you start to try to set it up as a bootable USB stick  .\n\n*Reformat the USB to be FAT / FAT32 - can be read by all OS's they say. I used a thing on Mac > Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility for that  \n\n*Then you need the Ubuntu .iso that matches your system.   \n\n*After downloading .iso you can't just put it onto the USB stick - it won't work. It has to be done using Easy CD Creator or UnetBootin or similar. This puts the .iso on the stick in a way that is accessible in a bootable format. The boot stuff is added onto the .iso using the software just named.  \n\n*So you then turn off your computer. Insert the USB, and turn on the system.   \n\n*For it to now work, you must have checked the BIOS for the order in which your computer goes looking for the operating system (Ubuntu, OSX, Win etc)   \n\n*For me pressing ESC key got me into the backend - \"pause startup\" words appeared bottom lhs of my screen then opened up options. F10 is the one you want.  \n\n*Click across to 3rd or 4th tab that gives you the option to enter the BIOS \n\n*Use down arrows to highlight it, then press enter to get into it  \n\n*Find entry that says Boot Order or similar - again down arrows to choose it, then enter to access the options. Choose USB as first device. Use F5 and F6 to move USB up to top spot - booting from USB will happen first then.  \n\n*So you've set USB to be first - you have your FAT / FAT32 formatted stick with a bootable version of Ubuntu or whatever on it.  \n\n*Your computer is off, you have inserted the USB stick - USB2 is good, USB3\n\n*Bootup and it should work  \n\n*On mine it did, I can see two disks on bottom lhs of screen - one is smaller ie your USB and the other is larger ie the hard drive.

Ended up with hundreds of lines of stuff about Grub as I tried to find out about how to access it/set it to work Ended up not being able to close terminal so had to power down.\nGetting desperate now after days, and some nights - booted up again with ESC pressed. Tried a few things in backend - eg a place there to set passwords - so did that at both locations fingers crossed. Just caused me to have a loud sound and had to enter 'admin' the generic word I was trialing with. Then could not disable that.\nAlso tried a few things I had come across in my reading - eg set Legacy Mode to on even tho i warns you things might break. Turned Secure mode off.\nAnd then Voila!\nReleased from my problems because machine is now not working at all! Ohhh mama.\nWhat's your answer? Please. Anyone?  \n\nA: Welcome to AskUbuntu Maia!\nLooks like you messed up your BIOS. The BIOS password is NOT the Ubuntu password. Your first priority should be to reset your BIOS to its defaults. (Pressing Esc after starting the machine you should look for something like \"Reset Settings to default\" or \"Load Default Settings\" in your BIOS.) It will likely request the BIOS password you set. After that Ubuntu should boot again.\nIf you can't provide a password that BIOS will accept then you should get your BIOS flashed. You likely won't have the necessary equipment for external BIOS flashing, so your best bet would be to ask around your local computer shops whether someone can do that (they will need the exact model number for your laptop to tell whether they can flash it). It shouldn't take them long, but I'm not sure on it's pricing nowadays and the equipment might be rare enough that they might need to contact official / semi official HP repair shops which means that this endeavor might take a week or more.\nIf you can get to the point where Ubuntu boots, you should be able to reboot and use your live USB to boot into a system where you can run commands with sudo.\nThere you only need to modify your laptop's /etc/shadow (your HDD will be likely auto-mounted by the file manager, unless it's encrypted). Now you will need to look for your username and just delete the characters between the first and second :, it is important to only delete those characters (failure to comply renders that account unusable until repaired). Eg.:\nYou will have something like\nusername:$6$XXXXXXXX:<lots of other characters>\n\nthe XXXXXXXX will be numbers and letters and you should only delete the $6$XXXXXXXX part so it becomes\nusername::<lots of other characters>\n\nThis will remove the password from your account in Ubuntu and you will be able to log in. So reboot without the live USB and you are done.\nAfter that (if you wish) you can set a new password by issuing passwd from a terminal.\nHope this helps, and you can get your system working again!\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and Windows?

When I try to launch eclipse from the terminal it opens Eclipse 3.8.\nHow I can remove Eclipse 3.8 and have the terminal command open Eclipse 4.5?\n\nA: This is the version of eclipse (3.8.1-7) [universe]eclipse (3.8.1-7) [universe] that ships with 15.04. My guess is that you have installed the 4.5 version independently of the apt packaging system.

I'm writing a program that's intended for use on an embedded CPU. For that, I'm trying to set up a small Ubuntu. Ubuntu Minimal looks like it works, with one problem: I need to do my own graphics display in my program. I can do this fine on a regular Ubuntu's virtual terminals via the framebuffer device, but Minimal seems to not have /dev/fb0.\nI've googled all day yesterday, but still can't find a way to get Ubuntu Minimal to make a framebuffer device. What's the trick to activating the framebuffer device on Ubuntu 15.04 \"Vivid Vervet\" Minimal?\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding my user to the video group.\n\n*Uncommenting the GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 entry in /etc/default/grub and calling update-grub (oh, and hwinfo doesn't seem to be available either)\n\n*There is no /boot/grub/menu.lst where many people seem to suggest I uncomment something\n\n*sudo modprobe vesafb says \"Module vesafb not found\", if I try uvesafb it says it can't run /sbin/v86d\n\n*/etc/modprobe.de/blacklist-framebuffer.conf is empty\n\n*I haven't been able to find an apt-get package that looks like it could contain the framebuffer support\n\n*Some spots mention doing something with \"kernel args\", but I can't find any info on what they are and how to set them, everyone seems to assume I know where they are and how to edit them.\n\n*I also tried adding modeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=640x480 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, but that doesn't change anything either.\n\n\nAny clues for finding the spot where I can turn on fb0, or how I can check whether the Kernel even has framebuffer support compiled in, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Since I'm currently running Ubuntu Minimal on VirtualBox's emulated VESA-compatible graphics card, for this particular case the following 3 steps were sufficient:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncomment the GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 entry in /etc/default/grub and call sudo update-grub.\n\n*Do sudo apt-get install v86d (which the modprobe call mentioned above said was missing).\n\n*Do sudo modprobe uvesafb\nThanks to @psusi for making me aware that the error could mean it's completely missing, not just damaged or insufficient in some other way.\nHowever, I still don't know what I'd have to do on different hardware to find out how to do the equivalent, so if anyone has an explanation that is more general and less specific, I'd be interested in hearing it.

I apologise in advance for the misuse of terminology. Please correct me where necessary.\nFor my work I am going to be running simulations remotely via ssh on several ubuntu machines. These machines are in a network and my account is linked across all of them, ie. $HOME is /home/links/Ogaday and is mirrored across each machine. So I make a directory on one machine in that folder, and it appears in another machine (this is a case where I don't know how to use the correct terms). There is also local memory on each machine, accessible by each user on that machine, called /scratch/. I will make a directory in /scratch/ to do my actual work in, because I don't think I have enough memory on my account to run the simulations in $HOME, and it will be faster because it's all local, I assume. \nNow, there is software installed on those machines that I need to use, and it is installed in directories that I have no write access to (/usr/local/software/). However, that software has a bash script that sets environment variables. I'm supposed to append the bash script (source /usr/local/software/etc/bashrc) to $HOME/.bashrc in order to set the necessary environment variables. Pretty standard so far, this sets everything up for this software to run when I log in, correct? Now, I think that the software on these computers hasn't been configured properly, because the .../etc/bashrc is supposed to set a variable called $SOFTWARE_INST_DIR, the install directory. By default, this is $HOME/software, and it is necessary to change that bashrc file so that it instead sets it to /usr/local/software. Of course, I don't have write access to to .../etc/bashrc. There are other similar issues, this is just the thing that fails first.\nAs a fix, I copied that file into $HOME/software-etc/bashrc and appended source $HOME/software-etc/bashrc to $HOME/.bashrc instead of appending source /usr/local/software/etc/bashrc, so that I can edit the variables it assigns. Is there anything fundamentally wrong with this? I thought another solution would be to, instead of copying the bashrc file from the software install location, appending export $HOME=/scratch/ogaday to .bashrc, which I assume would reassign my home directory to scratch. Am I correct? Is this dangerous? I wouldn't really be using these machines for anything else except running long simulations on them.\nps: The final solution would be to ask the IT guys to look into it I guess! I'd rather do a quick fix though if it's possible.\n\nA: No, there is nothing wrong with copying the rc file somewhere else. That said, while you can indeed change your $HOME by adding HOME=/foo to one of the files read on startup (~/.profile, for example), that is really not a good idea. HOME is used by many things, not just your scripts and there's no reason to change it since that can have unintended consequences. \nFor example, the default configuration files for a variety of programs, including your shell, are stored in $HOME. If you change that, your settings will be lost. \nNow, if I understand correctly, your main objective here is to have $HOME/software point to /usr/local/software. Instead of copying files around, the simplest solution would be to make $HOME/software a link pointing to /usr/local/software. \n\n\n*\n\n*Rename $HOME/software (if it already exists):\nmv $HOME/software $HOME/software.old\n\n\n*Make a link called $HOME/software that points to /usr/local/software:\nln -s /usr/local/software $HOME/software\n\nNow, anything looking for $HOME/software will actually find /usr/local/software instead. \nSimilarly, in order to do your work locally on each machine, create the directory in /scratch and then link it to your $HOME:\nmkdir /scratch/ogaday\nln -s /scratch/ogaday $HOME/work\n\nNow, everything you do in $HOME/work will actually happen in /scratch/ogaday.     \nFinally, bear in mind that there are different types of shell. When you log in via ssh, you are running an interactive login shell and, on many systems, $HOME/.bashrc is ignored by those shells. While Ubuntu specifically does also read $HOME/.bashrc, for such shells, many other distributions don't. Therefore, it is safer to use $HOME/.profile and not $HOME/.bashrc to set environment variables. See here for an explanation of what files are read when. \n", "Q: How to enable TLS Client Certificate Authentication in Evolution? I access my contacts via WebDav on the work LAN in evolution.

Which has been happening a lot because of the new UEFI mobo's and Windows 8+.\nCan't help you with the Raid situation, but the Ubuntu installer will always refuse to install on GPT HDD's.\nTry using the Windows install disk to access repair options.

That is why I put swap, /var, /tmp, and /home on the HDD.\nI also would like to hear your advice on having the swap in RAM (mine is 8GB big) and /home having symbolic links for Pictures, Documents, Videos, Music leading to the Data (NTFS) partition, because some people say it's nice, some that it's bad and should instead use a /media/transferthingies (NTFS) partition to exchange files between the two OS.\nOh and about the /boot/efi partition, do I really need it ?\n\nAbout the installation process, I believe it is something like :\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserve space on SSD and HDD with Ubuntu CD for NTFS and ext4 partitions\n\n*Install Windows 10 with Windows CD\n\n*Install Ubuntu with Ubuntu CD \n\n*Make symbolic links in /home to my Data (NTFS) partition\n\n\n\nAnything I missed ? I hope I didn't, this post is already long...\nThanks for at least reading through this, and thanks in advance for those who will lend a hand :)\n\nA: Well, here's how I would do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and format all partitions to be used by Windows only.\n\n*Install Windows 10 in either BIOS or EFI mode.\n\n*Get a few cups of coffee while this installs.\n\n*Install Ubuntu from the CD/DVD, and select to use your own partitioning (Make sure to boot from the Ubuntu DVD using the same mode you installed Windows in - BIOS or EFI).\n\n*Create the Ubuntu partitions.\n\n*Let it install Ubuntu.\n\n*Get a cup of coffee while it installs.\n\n*Check to see that it boots to the GRUB2 boot manager.\n\n*Boot into each OS and make sure both have Identical network configurations.  e.g. IP address, hostname, etc.  You might want to add an identifier to the end of the hostname to distinguish which OS you're in, like this:  MyAwesomePC-Win10 and MyAwesomePC-Linux.\n\n\nA: This is my solution. I think you shouldn't divide your SSD drive to a lot of partitions like that. It will make your SSD slower.\nI think you have to choose 1 OS to install all of that OS to SSD drive. Because you just have 256GB SSD so I think Linux OS is a good choose. \nSSD:\n/          20GB\n/usr       80->100GB\n/another....(don't need /boot partition as little partitions as possible)\n\nAt this time, Linux supported a lot of program. If you are woking in computer science, I thought you had to install a lot of very heavy program like: \nVisual, CSS, Quartus,.v..v. So 80->100GB is enough for install all of that program, and maybe you play game too.\nYour HHD you will install all of Windows OS, and store films, documents,..v..v\nThat is just my opinion.

Just make sure you don't choose the Hibernate option in Windows, or else you won't be able to access that partition from Ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a great answer to your problem.

It will be fixed in the next release. \nThe solution is to use gparted, or format the device with command-line:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/device \n\n(necessary sudo and device name omitted for obvious reasons). \nAnyway, I strongly advise against using a whole, unpartitioned device. It will probably not automount or misbehave in a lot of cases. Create a partition table, one big partition, and format it --- you'll lose a couple of megabytes but you'll have a much more standard device. \nTo use gparted (short guide because How to format a USB flash drive? has a video --- I hate that...) \nAfter started gparted, remember to (1) choose the right device (triple check, and then again) and (2) unmount it if mounted (you can say it's mounted because then option like partition, format, etc are dimmed): \n \nthen create a partition table if needed: \n\nand create a big partition with Partition->New. Choose (1) a primary partion, the (2) right type, and if you add a label in (3) this will be the name of the device when automounted. \n\n...and then format it: \n\nNotice that gparted will not do all the operation instantly. It will create a list in the bottom window...: \n\n...and to really do it you have to choose Edit->Apply all.. :\n\n... you're done!\nAnd a final note. If you format your filesystem as ext4, you have to change the ownership of its root directory after the formatting --- otherwise it will be owned by root. \nFor vfat and msdos-like filesystems this is not a problem, because the auto-mounter will force the ownership to you anyway. In the case of unix-like filesystem this will not happen. So after you mount your new device, you have to \n sudo chown $USER /media/$USER/newdevice/.\n\n...and then be sure that you have the same UID on all the machines you use. \n", "Q: How did my launcher turn green?

My knowledge of EFI, secure boot and their interaction is fairly limited (going through info pages as I write this).\n\nA: As I do not know whether Microsoft did change the boot loader signature with the update\n(this anyway would be off-topic here) I suggest the following procedure:  \nFirst disable hibernation and Fast Boot in Windows.  \nBoot into Windows - open command prompt as administrator and execute this command:  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nThen disable (uncheck) Fast Boot in Control Panel -> Energy Settings (show hidden settings).\nShutdown the machine (do NOT reboot) completely.  \nThen reinstall GRUB bootloader to your Ubuntu installation  in EFI mode. \nBoot from the Ubuntu install media - then  open a terminal and execute:  \nsudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt/boot/efi\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\nsudo chroot /mnt\ngrub-install /dev/sd*\nupdate-grub  \n\nNote :  \nsd* = disk | sd** = efi partition | sd*** = system partition  \nIf you do not know the partition numbers you can easily identify them with GParted.\nThe (Graphic User Interface) tool is already included in the Ubuntu installation media.  \nIf this solution does not work you unfortunately will have to reinstall ubuntu in insecure mode.\nBoot into BIOS (UEFI) and disable Secure Boot, then reinstall ubuntu in the way you did before.\n\nA: So, after several hours of catching up with the EFI documentation and even trying out rEFInd bootloader (which didn't work; I was getting the same message as for grub), I decided to disable 'secure boot' from the BIOS menu and it worked.\nIt seems that with my forced update I've overwritten the already cryptographically signed bootloader that Ubuntu was using since initial installation (I believe it is called shim).\nStill though, I haven't understood how shim is used instead of grub.\n(My guess is that it has to do with the configuration on the ESP; someone can correct me or answer this for me).\n", "Q: KDE Development on Ubuntu I'm new to Ubuntu (14.04 LTS) and while I understand a bit about Linux I'm still confused about the entire concept because when I read terms like IRC, GTK, Gnome, Qt and so on, I get confused as to what they mean.

A distribution essentially is a collection of software and how they are “glued together”. There are various distributions because there are different needs/taste. As analogy consider McDonalds. There are several types of burgers (distributions), with different number of breads, meat, cheese, etc, such as Big Mac and Chesseburguer. Each person usually prefer a different type of sandwitch (distribution) based on their needs.\nMoving on, GTK+ and Qt are graphic toolkits (think of them as primitives). A graphical software 'module' that talks with the \"screen\" software module of the operating system (ex: X11). Graphic applications, such as Nautilus or Dolphin, respectively GNOME and KDE file managers, are built using these primitives (GTK+ and Qt). For example, they (the applications) say: hey give me and draw a window. Ok, now draw a menu, draw a button, etc.\nFurther, we can generalize and say that KDE essentially is a collection, itself, of softwares that are built on top of the Qt framework (graphical 'module'). Not only KDE provide applications, such as Dolphin, K3B, Amarok, they also provide higher level libraries/modules (usually built on top of Qt or other 'module') for these applications. For example libraries that make it easier to handle and work with files, or send/receive data. \nFurther, they (KDE) also provide their own graphic environment, called Plasma. Plasma is an application (also on top of Qt) that controls the main GUI (the taskbar, tray area, desktop, etc). \nHaving said that, if you want to help KDE with applications all you need is the Qt toolkit (qt, pyQT, etc) and possibly KDE libraries (kio, kparts, etc).\nIf you want to develop KDE libraries, such as an existing library, you will need Qt and preferred an updated KDE collection of software to test the applications that use the library.\nFinally, if you intend to develop plasma itself (“the main GUI”), then you will need the latest Qt and KDE collection of software.\n", "Q: Fresh Ubuntu unable to find internet connections I re-installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my partitioned Mac today after deleting the old Ubuntu partition.

Now I need to remove this software from my Linux machine running Ubuntu 15.04 (64 Bit). I browsed their support section (support.hubstaff.com) but could not find a single article there describing the process.\nI went a little further and tried to find if their installer had some kind of option (--help) that could work for uninstalling the software. Oddly, I didn't find any option in it, I only saw options like \"help screen\", \"changing temporary directory\" etc. Nothing too useful there.\nAnother odd thing is never could find anywhere (by Googling) where is this thing installed in the Linux directory structure.\nNow I'm feeling really suspicious about this software.\nIt'd be really helpful if somebody could show me how to uninstall Hubstaff.\n\nA: I understand your suspicions but I use Hubstaff (for Windows) and don't have anything to worry about.\nYou can remove Hubstaff on Linux by navigating to the Hubstaff folder and dragging the \"uninstall-Hubstaff.sh\" file to a terminal window. A new support article will be published on this soon.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Uninstalling on Linux\nNavigate to the Hubstaff folder (usually inside your home folder) and drag the uninstall-Hubstaff.sh file to a terminal window. Please follow the steps below:\nSTEP 1\nRight click the .sh file and click “Properties”.\nSTEP 2\nThen make sure you allow executing the file as a program.\nSTEP 3\nDrag and drop the .sh file into the terminal window (or simply run the file path from the terminal window) and hit enter.

It is something else entirely.\nConsequently, you can't change the socket into a directory, any more than you can change a mouse into a keyboard.\nHowever, if you just want to remove the socket, you should be able to do so by using rm pipe.  Since the file (socket file) you show is owned by root, you need root privileges to do this.  (On the other hand, since the file you show is owned by root, you probably shouldn't remove it unless you know exactly what you are doing and why.  Otherwise things will get messy.  Root privileges give you total power over your computer, including the power to destroy it if you don't know what you are doing.)\nTo create a directory with the name directory_name, just type mkdir directory_name.\nAnd on a more general note, if you are running into a situation that you think would be solved by turning a socket into a directory, you probably went \"off the rails\" quite a while ago, and you should back up and see where things went wrong, and then post a question about that.  ;)\n", "Q: 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' is required for Ubuntu 14.04 How can I solve this problem?\nuser@user-admin:~$ autoreconf -ifv\nautoreconf: 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' is required\n\n\nA: \nFrom your comments on A.B.'s now-deleted answer, you want to build this software.  This answer addresses this fact.  Next time, tell us what software you're building, what steps you've tried so far, and whether you've read any documentation relating to building the given software, so you get help faster with issues such as these.\n\nFirst, you need all the build dependencies, and the fastest way to install them all is this command, which installs not only the compiler but the additional boost libraries and Flex that you'll need.  sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev cmake flex\nSecondly, create a directory and go into it (you said ~/prefix/sw in your comments).\nThirdly, git clone https://github.com/redpony/cdec.git.\nFourthly, you probably did not read the README page on the GitHub repository which explains what commands to run to make the software build.  It lists these as the build steps, after cd-ing into the newly created cdec folder:\ncmake .\nmake -j4\nmake test\n./tests/run-system-tests.pl\n\nWhy you would run some other commands other than the ones listed in the repository documentation, I do not know.

I have a bare new drive and I plan on resorting back to dual-booting windows. I had re-re-installed Ubuntu and windows several time and it did not work. I would only get windows to boot or a error message saying \"please install a operating software media\"\nSo looking into the installer, i found this \"BIOS boot area\"\nI have no idea what this dose or if i need it (yes I've done research on what it dose, but not in full detail nor do I understand it). So do I need to use \"BIOS boot area\" for dual boot and do I half to install windows on the PC first before Ubuntu??\n\nA: It's unclear precisely what the \"BIOS boot area\" to which you refer is. Two possibilities spring to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Master Boot Record's (MBR's) boot code -- The MBR is simply the first sector of the hard disk. It holds both the first stage of the BIOS boot loader and the MBR partition table. When a BIOS-based computer boots, it reads the MBR and executes whatever code it finds there. The same thing happens with an EFI-based computer with its Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy support\") active and in control of the boot process. If no executable code is in the MBR, the computer is likely to lock up, possibly with a message like the one you've described; but details vary from one computer to another.\n\n*The BIOS Boot Partition -- This is a type of partition that can be present on GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks that holds the second stage of GRUB 2. If it's not present, GRUB 2 will refuse to install to such disks unless you pass it an override option, in which case GRUB's second stage goes in a filesystem. If GRUB is installed but then the BIOS Boot Partition is damaged, the boot will fail. I don't recall offhand if you'll see any error messages in this case.\n\n\nBacking up a bit, Rule Number One when dual-booting is to install both your OSes in the same boot mode -- BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI. If you install one OS in BIOS mode and the other in EFI mode, you'll have to jump through extra hoops to get it to work. The result is usually awkward at best. Sometimes it's impossible; it depends on the firmware and OSes.\nIf you install Windows, the boot mode dictates the partition table type (MBR or GPT) -- Windows insists on having an MBR for a BIOS-mode boot and GPT for an EFI-mode boot. Linux is more flexible, but there are sometimes problems with BIOS/GPT and EFI/MBR combinations, so they're best avoided if at all possible. In sum, your choice of boot mode and partition table are tied together. Depending on your firmware and hardware (disk size), you may want to pick your boot mode and set your partition table type appropriately or pick your partition table type and set your boot mode to match. You've presented no information that would help me give more specific advice; however, as a general rule, EFI-mode booting is best on modern computers, since activating the CSM complicates the boot path, which makes controlling and debugging the boot process harder. See this page of mine for more on this subject. You may also want to read the following pages for more on EFI-mode booting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's page on how EFI works\n\n*My page on installing Linux in EFI mode\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on EFI-mode installations\n", "Q: I would like to run a command as a bash script?

Yes I know how to install Ubuntu LiveCD on a USB stick, but what I want to know how to do is how to install full Ubuntu on the same USB stick that the LiveCD is booted from. So, install Ubuntu LiveCD on USB stick, boot from it, then install a complete installation of Ubuntu on the same USB stick that is running the LiveCD.\n\nA: That depends on how you have created your USB stick. If you used dd to copy the image to the raw device (not a partition) then I don't see how you could add the necessary partitions afterwards.\nIf you have a partition table on the stick then just create the necessary partitions and select the appropriate partitioning scheme you want to use. This will probably overwrite the bootloader or it's configuration for the LiveISO which can be tricky to work around, but if you intend to boot UEFI and loop mount the ISO like in section 2 from How to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media? then it should be possible to install to another partition on the same storage device and use the FAT partition as ESP.\nIt's almost the reverse of putting a LiveISO onto your ESP and configuring it according to the instructions in the link. You can also create a BIOS bootable partition on GPT is you need it, setting up MBR booting could be done in almost the same way (embedding the MBR image is a bit tricky) but I haven't looked into that.\n", "Q: permission denied error while trying to run .sh file I am getting the following permission denied error while trying to run .sh file on lubuntu:\n./file.sh: 11: ./file.sh: ./qemu-system-i386: Permission denied\n\nnote: chmod +x file.sh , command is already given.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: use sudo to execute file.sh\n sudo ./file.sh\n\nany user can execute command qemu-system-i386 but seems like device that you want to use is either owned by root or read-only.\nif you want to use device in read-only mode then you have to add readonly=on attribute. i don't know what you have written in file.sh. so i am giving some reference that may help you. \n\n\n*\n\n*here is long discussion about similar problem\n\n*here is some information that may be helpful\n\n*qemu-system-i386: use documentation  more info about\nqemu-system-i386\n", "Q: Software & Updates defaults Is the default setting for version 14.0403 LTS for all to be selected for the \"Ubuntu Software\" tab and for \"Updates\" everything except \"pre release updates to be selected?\n\nA: Short Answer: Yes\n\n\nThese are default settings.\n", "Q: Problem with connecting Android Phone with Ubuntu 14.04 I have Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 android phone .

Within my un-encrypted home folder, I have a Personal folder which is encrypted using ecryptfs. I followed mainly this tutorial\nI know that if I have LUKS partition (as I have on my external USB), I must not run fsck directly on the disk, It must be run as\n fsck -M /dev/mapper/luks-4c6...\n\nBut what about the ecryptfs folder. Since its a stacked file system, I really don't have control over skipping this folder when checking the hard disk. My doubts are \n\n\n*\n\n*Would fsck ing the hard disk mess up ecryptfs folder(s) \n\n*Assuming answer as no to above, would fsck skip this folder (but then how would fsck really know anything about whats on top of the file\nsystem).  \n\n*On the other hand, how do I ensure that the ecryptfs\nfolders dont get corrupted. (Some times I do forget to unmount while\nshutting down the PC).\n\n*Or unlike LUKS, I do not need to worry about fsck ing individual\ncontainers in ecryptfs. fscking the underlying container is good\nenough and supported.\n\n\nA: fsck checks the underlying, physical, blocks-on-disk filesystem. It Must do this when nobody else is accessing the disk (single-user, Live boot). At that time, your encrypted folder is not mounted, therefore not visible, except as blocks-on-disk of binary data with really silly filenames (do a ls of the .Private/ subdirectory to see what I mean). It's only when you have logged in, and mounted your ecryptfs folder that it is decrypted, and can be said to \"exist\". So in order, the answers to your multiple questions are:  \nNo.  \nThat folder cannot be said to \"exist\" at fsck time.\nSince the encrypted folder is mounted, and appears in /etc/mtab, it will be \"handled\" when you do a polite shutdown (sudo shutdown, or shut down from the Log out menu. If you just kill power, or halt the VM, you will corrupt your encrypted (and non-encrypted) filesystems, eventually, due to updated disk meta information in RAM not being written to \"disk\". fsck may then detect (and offer to \"fix\") problems with the underlying, physical, blocks-on-disk filesystem, which could trash the encrypted filesystem. Do polite shutdowns.\nThe filesystems you are worrying about have not been created at fsck time.  \n", "Q: What are advantages of \"cp\" over \"rsync\"? It seems that rsync can do all the work of cp.\n\nA: cp is a part of coreutils, therefore it is present everywhere. furthermore, it primarily was designed to copy files inside one computer.\nrsync isn't a part of coreutils, it isn't present even on the default environment. It was primarily designed to transfer files over network. Also rsync has more dependencies comparing to coreutils, however this difference doesn't make a big sense.\nThe main advantage of cp over rsync is time and less cpu usage .\n\n\nReference here,here,here,here,here and here\n", "Q: tune2fs mount-count: is it disabled by default (set to -1). This may be in part duplicate . However my installation is 15.04 64 bit desktop. And no one has answered on that question.

Bad disk drives, cables, memory,\n              and kernel bugs could all corrupt a filesystem without marking the filesystem dirty or in error.  If you are using journaling on your\n              filesystem, your filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not normally be checked.  A filesystem error detected by the  ker‐\n              nel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, but it may already be too late to prevent data loss at that point.\"\nAm I missing some thing here? Some thing this important would it not be automatically set during the installation. \nPlease guide as to whether I should panic and force fsck on all my machines/external disks (some of them are couple of years old. \nAnd also should I explicitly set these parameters.\n\nA: You shouldn't panic just yet, instead, let's have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilesystemTroubleshooting:\n\"There are 4 ways the fsck tool usually gets run (listed in order of frequency of occurrence):\n\n\n*\n\n*it runs automatically during computer bootup every X days or Y mounts (whichever comes first). This is determined during the creation of the filesystem and can later be adjusted using tune2fs.\n\n*it runs automatically if a filesystem has not been cleanly unmounted (e.g.: powercut)\n\n*user runs it against an unmounted filesystem\n\n*user makes it run at next bootup \"\n\n\nNote the number 2 in particular:\n\"If a filesystem has not been cleanly unmounted, the system detects a dirty bit on the filesystem during the next bootup and starts a check. It is strongly recommended that one lets it finish. It is almost certain there are errors on the filesystem that fsck will detect and attempt to fix. Nevertheless, one can still interrupt the check and let the system boot up on a possibly corrupted filesystem.\"\nIn the end, it is the matter of convinience vs extra-caution - always a fine balance.\nPS: It's a good idea not to rely on fsck alone, but also keep regular backups of all data you don't want to lose.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 Quick question as I can't seem to find a question regarding installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 10.\nI've followed the instructions in the Ubuntu installation documentation as I'd like to install Ubtunu alongside windows 10, at least until I get the hang of Ubuntu. However, I can't find the UEFI editor in Windows 10 at all.

After that, you are able to use grub to choose which operating system you want to use. I am not sure if it is the best way, but it is the easiest way, and it is what people usually do.\n\nHowever, I can't find the UEFI editor in Windows 10 at all. \n\nIn my opinion, it has to be somewhere it cannot just dissapear. But the question is - do you really need UEFI? \n", "Q: How to determine the `/dev` path to a Flash drive When does a Flash drive inserted end up being /dev/sdb as opposed to /dev/sdb1 or vice versa? What is the command line that will determine the path of a newly inserted Flash drive?\n\nA: /dev/sdb refers to the drive itself—the entire flash drive, not a partition on it.  This is useful if you are going to do something affecting the entire flash drive, such as reformatting it, but not so useful if your flash drive is already formatted and you just want to access files stored on it.  (Note: by \"reformatting the entire drive\", I really meant \"changing the type of partition map\", since reformatting a single partition wouldn't involve /dev/sdb.)\n/dev/sdb1 refers to the first partition on the /dev/sdb drive.  If the flash drive has at least one partition (i.e. it has been formatted for use), you should have both /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 after inserting the flash drive.  You may also have /dev/sdb2, /dev/sdb3, etc., if your flash drive has more partitions, but if you are simply using a flash drive out of the box and haven't done any special formatting to it, you will likely have only one partition filling the entire flash drive.  (For the sake of completeness, the partition will need a filesystem on it to store files, but again, a flash drive fresh out of the box will have this already set up.)\nIt's important to know that the letter b in that name should not be relied on.  Depending on numerous factors (such as whether other USB drives have been used, in what sequence the drives are discovered by your computer, and many other factors), your computer may create a device node for your flash drive at /dev/sdc instead of /dev/sdb, or even at /dev/sdd.  (The partition will have a matching name with a trailing 1 in any case: /dev/sdc1 or /dev/sdd1, as applicable.)\nThis brings us to the next part of your question: How to determine what \"name\" the computer has assigned to your flash drive.  By now you understand that it's not /dev/sdb as opposed to /dev/sdb1; instead, it's both /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1, as opposed to both of /dev/sdc and /dev/sdc1.  The easiest way to list this information is with the lsblk command.  That will list the block devices connected to your computer.  It should be fairly obvious which is the flash drive, but to be certain, you can run lsblk before inserting the flash drive, and then run it again immediately after inserting the flash drive.  This way, the device that is showing up newly in the command output is the flash drive.\nAnd lastly, if you happen to be asking this question to help automate the mounting of a flash drive, I recommend learning about the /etc/fstab file, and about using \"device labels\" or \"device UUIDs\" to specify which drive to mount.\n", "Q: Hibernate doesnot resume last state I enabled hibernation following this steps:\nHow to enable hibernation in 15.04?\nI can now see \"hibernate\" option and also hibernate seems to turn my computer off.

Can you please tell me what should I do?\n\nA: Your ubuntu works perfectly fine. You have to set up your router, so first of all read about Port Forwarding. Then you have to give your computer a static ip inside your home network. You can define it from your router. When you do this steps , the user will enter your public ip of your router and can see your site. The problem is that your public ip is not static , it may change everytime your home internet is rebooted. Also it is not secure because if someone had access to your laptop outside your hoek network they can have access to all your devices through security holes. \nTo learn how to set up your route, you should ask the routers site of stackexchange as proposed in the comment. \nP.s. you can use something like Heroku, if you only want to show your site for free to someone.

Minimum version that I require is 3.0.2 for my project ,so how can I use 'apt-get' to install a newer version? Or do I have to install it manually, which kind of eliminates the purpose of having a package manager.\nSame goes for eclipse v3.8 and I need v4.4 (or at least v4.x).\n\nA: CMake 3.0.2 is shipped with Ubuntu 15.04. It happens that versions from new releases are made available to older releases via 'backports'.\nThe backports for Trusty can be found at the Ubuntu package site.\nUnfortunately, CMake is not in the official backport repository. However, I found several PPAs at Launchpad offering CMake>=3 for Trusty. For example the PPA\n\n*\n\n*by Nathan Osman offers up-to-date builds (3.2.2 at the time of writing)\nhttps://launchpad.net/~george-edison55/+archive/ubuntu/cmake-3.x\n\n\n*by Jan Henke offers a backport of version 3.0.2\nhttps://launchpad.net/~jhe/+archive/ubuntu/cmake-backport\nChoose a repo depending on your need to always get very recent versions or not. Add it with the usual\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:<...>/<...>\n\ndo sudo apt-get update and you should be offered the newer version.\nEclipse: Apparently since the new \"Mars\" release of Eclipse, the developers offer a proper installer for Linux/OSX/Windows. I would remove the old Eclipse version from the Ubuntu repos and try this one.\nI have not tried this out myself! I tried it out and it works very nicely.

Now I am getting the option to upgrade to Windows 10 but I fear that if I upgrade, it will delete Ubuntu from my system.\nHow can I upgrade to Windows 10 without losing Ubuntu? I have important data and it will take a lot of time to transfer my data to hard disk.\nIf there is a possible way to transfer my data from Ubuntu to Windows, it will also help me.\n\nA: Upgrading Windows shouldn't affect Ubuntu, unless you allow the Windows 10 installer to mess with your partitions.  If the Windows 10 installer simply changes the Windows partition, it won't affect the Ubuntu partition; that's pretty straightforward.\nThat being said...if you care about the data that much, you need backups.  Not just for this occasion, for ALL occasions.  I've heard it said: There are two types of people: Those who have complete, regularly updated backups of all their important files and software...and those who will.  Anyone who has experienced the sickening horror of a failed hard drive that contained the only copies of their files, will understand the black humor of this saying.\nNo hardware lasts forever.  Buy an external drive, they're very cheap these days; $70 can get you a good 1TB USB 3.0 drive.  And back up your important files.  If your computer got hit by a sledgehammer right now, would you pay $70 to have all your files back?  I thought so.\nBack Up Your Files.\n\nA: During the upgrade process Windows will likely tell you whether it's going to modify just its own partition, or also other partitions on your disc. If it only modifies the Windows partition nothing with your bootloader or Ubuntu partition should change.\nYou can transfer your files from Ubuntu to Windows right from your file manager. If you're using Nautilus, select your Windows partition in the sidebar under \"Devices\" and move your files to your Windows desktop as you would into any folder.\n", "Q: How can I change the ppi of an image in GIMP? I want to transform the images (of any size) to A3 size and I am using GIMP? \nIts only showing the 72ppi option but I want to increase it to 330 or more than 72ppi. Its not showing any option to edit?\nHow to do that?\n\nA: You can change this in the Print Size settings, accessible via Image -> Print Size.\nhttp://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-print-size.html\nPlease note that this will not change the image content. In particular, it will not increase or decrease the number of pixels in your image. \nFor A3 at 330 ppi, you will need an image size of about 3858 * 5455 pixels.\n", "Q: Trying to compile gnupg from source I downloaded the latest stable tarball from https://www.gnupg.org/download/ and extracted it to a folder on my ubuntu machine.\nI had to chmod 775 configure in order to be able to run it, then I ran ./configure\nI got this message right at the end:\n    GnuPG v2.0.29 has been configured as follows:\n\n\n    Revision:  120fc69  (4623)\n    Platform:  GNU/Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)\n\n\n    OpenPGP:   yes\n    S/MIME:    yes\n    Agent:     yes \n    Smartcard: yes (without internal CCID driver)\n    Gpgtar:    no\n\n\n    Protect tool:      (default)\n    Default agent:     (default)\n    Default pinentry:  (default)\n    Default scdaemon:  (default)\n    Default dirmngr:   (default)\n\n\n    Warning: Mismatches between the target platform and the\n             to be used libraries have been detected for:\n               libgpg-error libgcrypt\n             Please check above for more warning messages.\n\nI tried to run a sudo apt-get install libgpg-error libgcrypt but it said they couldn't be found, so I tried libgpg-error-dev libgcrypt-dev and got this:\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nlibgpg-error-dev is already the newest version.\nlibgcrypt11-dev is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 69 not upgraded.\n\nSo I tried to run make and this is what I saw at the very end\nMaking all in .\nmake[3]: Entering directory `/home/nitrous/gnupg-new/tests'\nsrcdir=.

How can i install a tar.gz file through the terminal. I've been trying to install the Opera Mobile Emulator.\n\nA: You don't need to install a tar.gz. It is a compressed file (like a .zip).\nTo extract the file from a terminal, download it (in this example, it will just be in your /home folder), and run\ntar xvf Opera_Mobile_Emulator_12.1_Linux.tar.gz\n\nOr you can right click it and choose extract here.\nThis will make a folder in /home called Opera_Mobile_Emulator_12.1_Linux, in this folder is an executable file (no install needed) called opera-mobile-emulator-launcher, double click this or run\ncd ~/Opera_Mobile_Emulator_12.1_Linux\n./opera-mobile-emulator-launcher\n\nIt should pop right up.\nHere is the manual for the tar command.\n\nA: If the file is named filename.tar.gz, use the command tar xvzf filename.tar.gz.  The x option means extract; the v option means to be verbose in reporting what the tar command is doing; the z option means the files were zipped; the f option means the filename will follow.\n(If you're new to the terminal, here's a useful tip: start typing the filename and press Tab.  The terminal will auto-complete the name of the file you are typing.  If there are two or more possible completions, hitting Tab twice will show a list of possible completions.)\nIf the file is named filename.tar, omit the z in the command above:\ntar xvf filename.tar.gz\n\nIf the file is named filename.gz, it is a zipped file that is NOT a tar archive.  Unzip it using the command gunzip filename.gz.\nYou say you are \"installing\" it; the above will just extract the files that are bundled up together (in what is called a \"tarball\").  If the file(s) inside the tarball are a software package, you will have more work to do to install the software.  Run the file command by typing file filename (where filename is the file that gets created from unpacking the tarball) to see what type of file filename is, and post the output in the comments below.  If it is just a directory, you might already have what you need and have no further work to do.\n", "Q: Converting unallocated space to GPT I'm trying to convert either unallocated space to GPT or /dev/sda3 to GPT so that I can install windows on said partition.

Everything you find with /dev/sda you should unmount using umount /dev/sdaX (instead of X the desired partition, e. g. /dev/sda2), of course in root mode, either using su or prepended sudo.\nFor creating partitions etc. use gparted which you can install using sudo apt-get install gparted, and start with gparted or gksu gparted.\n\nA: xdevs23's answer is good, but I want to elaborate on some issues. First, when you launched gdisk on your disk, it automatically converted MBR to GPT in memory. Anything you do subsequently works on the transformed GPT data structures, unless and until you hit w, at which point the disk itself is transformed to use GPT. The n command in gdisk creates a new partition. Thus, when you used n and then specified 3 as the partition, you were telling gdisk to create a new partition #3 -- but that partition entry already exists. The gdisk error refers to this fact; it has nothing to do with what partitions are currently mounted. (gdisk doesn't care about mounted partitions, and will readily delete or modify them -- but if you do so, your changes won't be visible until you restart or remove the disk, since the kernel will continue to use the old partition table.)\nAnother point, and really a more important one in this context, is to ask why you want to create a GPT partition. My guess is that Windows complained about the use of MBR and said it wanted GPT. This is simply a symptom that you booted the Windows installer in EFI/UEFI mode; but the use of MBR implies that Ubuntu is installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Mixing boot modes is not a good idea. The simplest solution may be to install Windows in BIOS mode, too. Doing this will require finding the right way to boot the Windows installation medium. You'll probably need to use your boot manager and pick the option for the boot medium that lacks the string \"UEFI\" in its description.\nThe trouble with this is that you've already got three primary partitions on the disk. If you intend to install Windows to one of those partitions (presumably /dev/sda3), you may be OK; however, Windows has a tendency to convert disks from a plain MBR setup to MBR with a Logical Disk Manager (LDM) layer atop it when the number of partitions exceeds four. If the Windows installer does this, you'll have a hard time fixing the problem, since Ubuntu can't boot from such disks -- at least, not easily, and I've never heard of anybody succeeding it making it work.\nThus, converting from MBR to GPT may be useful; however, you'll then need to re-install an Ubuntu boot loader. As I said, mixing boot modes is undesirable, so it will be best to install an EFI boot loader for Linux. You can do this either manually or in a semi-automated way. Using Boot Repair can do this -- but be sure to boot it in EFI mode. (In fact, disabling your CSM in your firmware setup utility may be best if you go this route.) Another alternative is to use my rEFInd boot manager on USB flash drive or CD-R to boot Ubuntu. You can then swap out the grub-pc package for the grub-efi package to install GRUB manually; or install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA to have rEFInd take over as your boot manager.\nYet another option may be to install Windows to a second disk. If you do this in BIOS mode, you won't need to mess with the Ubuntu boot loader. Windows can use LDM or not, as it desires, without causing problems for Ubuntu. This is obviously more likely to work on a desktop than on a laptop, and requires extra hardware.\nInstalling Windows in a virtual machine (using VirtualBox, KVM/QEMU, or something similar) can avoid many of the headaches I've just described, but may be limiting if you want Windows for game-playing or something else that requires direct hardware access.\nIn sum, you have a number of options. The trick is navigating them all. There are quite a few ways the installation you're attempting can go wrong, so if you don't know what you're doing, this can be hazardous. Overall, I recommend you try a virtual machine installation, if that's practical. If not, you really should read up on the subject of EFI-mode booting.

Please take a look and see if I am doing something wrong.\n\n\n*\n\n*I turned off Secure Boot (So that I could boot from USB).\n\n*Set boot mode to UEFI and Legacy from the default UEFI OS.

For some reason the Ubuntu setup failed to detect existing operating system on the disk and hence did not show me the \"install alongside\" option. This is where I am stuck. I have tried different ways to proceed from here by going into \"something else\" option but all my efforts have been wasteful.\nIn fact I lost windows 10 a couple of times so had to repeat step 3. Perhaps got my boot loader corrupt.\nWhat I understand is the Ubuntu setup must be aware of the existing OS on the machine and something is not letting it to do so. In the \"something else\" option the only partition I see is my full hard disk as a whole in free space.\nKindly help me with it.\n\nA: This sounds like the typical issue of mixing boot modes.\nEnsure that everything is setup and boots in the mode you want to install either UEFI or legacy. Disable or deprecate the other method during system installation (e.g. remove MBR loaders from installation media) so that you can rule out any confusion about that. \nRelated question: \"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\nA: To elaborate on LiveWireBT's answer, enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) greatly complicated your boot path and makes it impossible, from your description, to determine whether your re-installed Windows is installed in EFI/UEFI mode or in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If the latter, Windows will have incompletely converted the partition table from GPT to MBR form, which would confuse the Ubuntu installer, making the disk appear to be empty. Just as bad, the Ubuntu installer could end up booting in EFI mode, which could result in a mixed-mode OS installation (Windows in BIOS mode, Ubuntu in EFI mode). For more on the perils of the CSM, see my page on the subject.\nAs you might gather from the preceding, enabling the CSM/legacy support in your firmware was a mistake. If you can force the computer to boot in this mode, it's not so bad -- you can clean up the leftover GPT data with my FixParts, which is included in the gdisk package in Ubuntu, and proceed with your installation. Most computers, though, don't let you completely disable EFI-mode booting; even setting the firmware to \"legacy support\" just makes the CSM available; the computer might still choose to boot in EFI mode, and there's usually no clear indicator that you've booted in this mode rather than in BIOS mode.\nThus, the better course of action, IMHO, is to start over again: Disable the CSM in your firmware, re-install Windows in EFI mode, and then install Ubuntu in EFI mode. With the CSM disabled, there will be little or no chance of your booting in BIOS mode. (Theoretically there'll be no chance, but there's always the possibility that your firmware will still give itself the option of booting in BIOS mode, or you might miss something in the firmware setup utility, in which case all bets are off.)\nNote, however, that the \"install alongside\" option is usually missing from modern Windows installations to GPT disks. You may need to use the \"something else\" option to manually partition your disk.\n", "Q: Not allowed to add .txt file to Computer For a homework assignment I have to execute some commands and report the results.\nBut when I try du /var > tmp.txt it says I am not allowed to access tmp.txt.\nI have tried to use a different name for the file but no different results, I have tried to add the text file to the Computer folder in the GUI but I am unable to do that too.   \nI am in the sudo group, sudo echo ok returns ok\nMy question: why can't I add a simple txt file to the Computer folder and how can I do this?\n\nA: You may be in a folder where your user doesn't have permissions.\nTry du /var > ~/tmp.txt to write the file to your home directory, you should have write permission there.\n\nA: When you redirect output, the sudo is not applied to the output file.\nYou can do it by\ndu /var | sudo tee tmp.txt\n\nor\nsudo -i\ndu /var > tmp.txt\nexit\n\n", "Q: Package managers cause kernel freeze?

Ubuntu (Ubuntu Gnome 15.04) comes with an older kernel version than the required for that driver (according to uname).\nThis site lists a few simple commands to upgrade the Linux kernel to 4.2, which sounds promising:\ncd /tmp/\n\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.2-unstable/linux-headers-4.2.0-040200_4.2.0-040200.201508301530_all.deb\n\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.2-unstable/linux-headers-4.2.0-040200-generic_4.2.0-040200.201508301530_amd64.deb\n\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.2-unstable/linux-image-4.2.0-040200-generic_4.2.0-040200.201508301530_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-4.2.0-*.deb linux-image-4.2.0-*.deb\n\nWould upgrading the kernel through this fashion allow me to install the drivers for that specific wireless card and have it working properly (at least WiFi)? Should I get it working through another way instead, or is waiting for Ubuntu to update to a newer kernel itself the only option?\n\nA: The default drivers may be able to work with the card anyway, so you may not need to install those drivers. Not sure but M.2 may mean it is the same but smaller (guessing from here).\nAnyway, the driver you are referring to is the iwlwifi driver - e.g. by looking at the page or following these links: Intel Wireless AC 3160 card > Driver Downloads > Linux driver (3/25/2014). This has been included in the Linux kernel for ages - also if your card is the same as the 'Intel® Wireless 3160', that it has been supported since kernel 3.10:\n\nSo if you are yet to install Ubuntu, you should be able run Ubuntu on your machine with wifi working 'out of the box' (you can also check if it works from the live installer disc, without installing). Linux systems are generally not like Windows where you have to download weird software of websites to get it to work - everything you need (apart from some weird third party, often Windows/Mac only software) is included in the distributions repositories in packages, and can be installed from a Package Manager (e.g. the apt-get or aptitude command, sort of Software Center and Additional Drivers, Synaptic etc).\nIf it doesn't work, you can use the script here to get information about the card etc and either edit your existing question or ask a new one. Please make sure information such as the manufacturer and model of your computer, and what steps you have tried already to fix it.\nN.B: there are existing questions you should check through first before asking (example search), BUT some of these may be vendor specific issues or too old)\n", "Q: Networkmanager: dispatcher.d/pre-down.d is not executed on shutdown anymore I am using this (https://askubuntu.com/a/674106/39966) solution to unmount a NFS on shutdown.\nBut now I discovered, that in most of the cases, when I shutdown the computer via the XFCE menu, the pre-down script is not executed (I see this by a logger message which is not appearing)\n\nA: Others where having the same problem.\nIt looks like there was a change in Network Manager which no longer closes the connection on shutdown of Network Manager. I was able to add a systemd service to be executed when the network goes offline.\nI created a file /etc/systemd/system/networkdown.service with the content:\n[Unit]\nWants=network-online.target\nAfter=network.target network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/true\nExecStop=/bin/umount /media/media\nRemainAfterExit=yes\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nA: This answer worked well for me. But... I had to add an [Install] block at the bottom of the above unit file.\n[Unit]\nWants=network-online.target\nAfter=network.target network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/true\nExecStop=/bin/umount /media/media\nRemainAfterExit=yes\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=suspend.target\n\n", "Q: Can I create a panic button in Ubuntu? In case I'm ever raided or realise that I'm being spied upon whilst using my computer, is there a way in Ubuntu I can have a pre-set 'panic button' or series of keys that can log me out or secure my machine?\n\nA: If you only want to log out, there is a very quick way of doing it: ctrl + alt + del → enter and you're logged out. You don't need to look at any graphical stuff or do anything with your mouse which would take a lot of time which you might not have.\nHowever, I'd recommend shutting the system down to clear your ram, if you're paranoid (which I also recommend). Do do this, set a key combination to gnome-session-quit --power-off. Simply launch \"Keyboard\" from the dash and switch to the tab \"Shortcuts\". Under \"custom shortcuts\" you can ... well ... add a custom shortcut. Use the command stated above and a simple key combination with only 2 keys, so it goes fast.\nFrom then on you can press whatever key combination → arrow left → enter and your machine shuts down. Again, you don't need to look at your screen and see whats happening.\n\nA: There is something known as magic SYSRQ key. It's usually located on the same key as PRTSC. The typical usage is to safely reboot / power-off the system when it becomes unresponsive. \nIn particular , holding ALT+SYSRQ and pressing one by one REISUB safely reboots the system.\nHolding ALT+SYSRQ and pressing one by one REISUO safely powers-off the system.\nNow, if your goal is to abruptly power-off the system , holding ALT+SYSRQ and then pressing O should do the trick, but keep in mind that possible loss of data may occur. \nAlternatively you can send SIGKILL to all processes except init with I key or cause a system crash with C\nIf you want to merely lock the GUI screen, use Super+L shortcut.\nIf you want to kill your username out of GUI and console session, use killall -u username\nIf you are concerned about the security, full-disk encryption is probably a thing to consider. Working from a virtualbox OS with encrypted virtual disk is also a thing to consider. \n", "Q: dual monitor, rotate secondary screen I run 2 screens on an AMD r9 280x card, and I need to rotate my secondary screen. \nWhen I try to do that via the display settings, my main screen gets all garbled up and is unusable.

It has an SSD and a normal HDD. I'm using the SSD for booting and HDD for file storage etc.\nI installed Windows 7 first and once it installed I installed Kubuntu (as I always do) It usually detects the other OS and I rarely have any problems.

I have problems with a newly migrated BDC (2:4.1.6+dfsg-1ubuntu2.14.04.9) with POSIX ACL based permissions. I am unable to get it to work as the PDC, which fortunately still has a slightly older version (2:4.1.6+dfsg-1ubuntu2.14.04.7).\nPDC work flawlessly with the following set of permissions. The scheme is very basic but allows user of the group \"Accounting\" in the examples to share files and folders...\n # file: accounting\n # owner: root\n # group: root\n user::rwx\n group::r-x\n group:Accounting:rwx\n mask::rwx\n other::---\n default:user::rwx\n default:group::---\n default:group:Accounting:rwx\n default:mask::rwx\n default:other::---\n\nAnything that I may be missing? The only way I could get user allowed to create directory in the share is by exposing \"other\" permissions, which obviously is not desired. I am in the process of trying Windows ACL using acl_xattr, but so far I have not been able to achieve the same as with POSIX ACL.\nBoth smb.conf on PDC and BDC are identical, except for server role of course and WINS server on PDC. Share definitions are as per below.\n[accounting]\n   path = /srv/samba/accounting\n   writable = yes\n   nt acl support = yes\n\nWhat is really really crazy is that after a fresh setup of such share for testing and a service restart or reboot, everything seems to work with access via \\\\BDC\\share. However, after a while it breaks and no more access to folder is allowed (Win7, Win10 and WinXP). Under WinXP access is possible with \\\\bdc.domain.tld\\share for one instance and then stops. Under WinXP too it is subsequently allowed to access via \\\\<BDC_IP_ADDRESS>\\share...\nError log follows below for a test share.\nMany thanks in advance for any hint.\n--\n  [2015/10/03

I have read this How do I figure out what package something is in without resorting to Google? and understand how to tell what package a certain command is in, however I still have a problem, how do I tell what package a program is in if I don't even know how to launch through command-line because I have no idea of its name (which is precisely the problem)?\nSo, to give an example, I recently wanted to file a bug report against the program known as \"Software & Updates\" in the GUI, however I had no idea what its name in the command-line was nor what package it was in.\nI tried running apt-file search \"Software & Updates\", but the results weren't very useful and I ended up having to ask around and finally found out it was in the software-properties-gtk package.

You can retrieve an application's WM_CLASS property with the xprop command:\nxprop WM_CLASS  \n\nYour mouse cursor will turn to crosshairs. Click on the program. xprop will return the property.\n \nSo far I haven't found an application where this doesn't work, but it is possible some won't have the information you want held in the WM_CLASS property.\n", "Q: Purpose of '~/.cache' directory and when is it safe to delete? What is the purpose of every user's ~/.cache directory?\nUnder which circumstances can it be deleted, when should one be careful about its contents? \n\nA: This is by no means a definite answer.\nAccording to the XDG Base Directory Specification, $XDG_CACHE_HOME which defaults to $HOME/.cache holds\n\n[...]user-specific non-essential (cached) data[...]\n\nIt is however not specified what constitutes 'non-essential data'. Furthermore an application might not play by freedesktop rules and put whatever it wants in .cache.\nBrowsing through my cache folder, I find things like\n\n\n*\n\n*Browser caches. Safe enough to delete.\n\n*Thumbnails. Will be recreated if deleted.\n\n*software-center. Wasn't sure about that. Contains a file apthistory.p with your - well - history of apt. Moved it out of the way and it was recreated on the next start of the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\n*I guess the Software Updater stores package lists apt-file. Will be downloaded anew if deleted.\n\n*icon-cache. Like thumbs, will also be recreated. \n\n*compizconfig-1. Contains binary files; compiz seems to cache its configuration in optimized form from ~/.config/compizconfig-1.\n\n*dconf. This directory actually doesn't belong to $USER but root. Mine contains a single non plaintext file user. Since you can't delete it anyway without sudoing... No problem.\n\n*And some more directories which I don't deem critical.\n\n\nIn summary, I believe it perfectly safe to empty the cache folder. In fact I do this from time to time and never experienced faulty behaviour afterwards.\nThis is not a guarantee though, just my two cents and a (somewhat) educated guess.\n", "Q: Problem running vscode from terminal I followed the instructions for installing vscode:\n\nLinux\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Download Visual Studio Code for Linux.\n  \n*Make a new folder and extract VSCode-linux-x64.zip inside that folder.\n  \n*Double click on Code to run Visual Studio Code.\n  \n  \n  Tip: If you want to run VS Code from the terminal, create the following link substituting /path/to/vscode/Code with the absolute> path to the Code executable\nsudo ln -s /path/to/vscode/Code /usr/local/bin/code\nNow, you can simply type code . in any folder to start editing files\n  in that folder.\n\nHowever upon typing code .

I'm pretty new to the Ubuntu OS, so I'm worried that by naming partitions I might actually end up creating confusion later on.\nDoes the answer change if I'm setting up a software RAID 1 array?\n\nA: Naming partitions will make future management easier. It just creates an alias to the mount point, I'm pretty sure. Basically gives the partition mount point that can be called by using an easier to remember name, rather than just a number assignment.\nRead Here for more Details.\n\nA: The problem is that the device names as /dev/sda and /dev/sdb can change: add a disk to the system and the names can be easily messed up. \nLabels will not change, as the UUID (unique identifier) for disks. To avoid problems, when you install a new Ubuntu system normally the disks and partition are mounted/recognized by their UUID, and not the device name; look at my /etc/fstab:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

As far as I can tell it is from booting with EFI/UEFI media, as Rod Smith has stated.\nI ran the install using a USB jump drive with the Ubuntu Server 14.04.4 ISO and the intention of installing in BIOS mode. In the BIOS menu I selected to boot from USB. The install ran normally and I created the partitions as desired (using 500mb ext2 in raid1 for the /boot partition) but I could not change the boot flag. Also, the partitioner did not ask for primary/logical partitions. The installer ran until the GRUB install, then failed. I attempted this multiple times with install variations with the same result.\nNext I ran the install from a CD with the same ISO. I set up the partitions the same way and was able to set the bootable flag to on and also select primary/logical. The install then worked as expected and the GRUB install worked with complaint.\nI am still new to installing and have not figured out all the details of BIOS/UEFI, but as far as I can tell this is where the issue lies.\n\nA: The same was for me.

Recently I installed unclutter to hide the mouse pointer while I'm typing, since there is no option in Ubuntu 14.04 to hide mouse pointer. According to the man pages of unclutter ther is a option -keystroke that wait until a key has been pressed and hides the pointer. But my problem is that it doesn't work by running this command:\nunclutter -keystroke &\n\nAnother hint in the man pages is that:\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n         The -keystroke option may not work (that is, the cursor will not disappear) with\n         clients that request KeyRelease events.  Games and Xt applications  using  KeyUp\n         in  their  translation  tables are most likely to suffer from this problem.  The\n         most feasible solution is to extend unclutter to use the XTest extension to  get\n         all keyboard and mouse events, though this of course requires XTest to be in the\n         server too.\nThe -keystroke option does not distinguish modifier keys from keys  which  actu‐\n         ally  generate characters.  If desired this could be implemented in a simple way\n         by using XLookupString to see if any characters are returned.\n\nI must tell that I wouldn't like a timer for hiding mouse when it's idle. I would like it work like the windows.\n\nA: You can use xbanish to do this. It is well known that the unclutter keystroke function has been broken for quite some time. I have tested this solution and it works well.\nFirst, install git if it's not already installed:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential libxtst-dev x11proto-core-dev\n\nThen, clone the repo and install xbanish:\ncd\ngit clone https://github.com/jcs/xbanish.git\ncd xbanish\nmake\n\nNow, set an alias for xbanish:\necho \"alias xbanish='~/xbanish/xbanish &'\" | tee -a ~/.bashrc\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nYou can now run xbanish by simply running the following command:\nxbanish\n\nor\n~/xbanish/xbanish &\n\n\nAdditionally, here's a helpful tip that has helped me so much when it comes to \"no such file\" errors. \nYou can use apt-file search to find out what package contains a file you are looking for.

The question is interesting enough for further development (IMO) to see if a smooth solution can be created.\nLanguage: None\nAlthough I wrote the script in Python, the language is irrelevant to the issues I am running into; mostly related to peculiarities in the use of wmctrl.\nI could use xdotool to position windows, but since OP mentions moving a set of windows to another workspace, wmctrl has some advantages, especially on using Gnome, where workspaces are arranged different from Unity.\nAn example how it currently works, moving a group of windows\n\nmoving windows as a group\n\n\n*\n\n*screen cast\nThe example in the screen cast above was made on Unity. It should however work similarly on Gnome (apart from the deviation, see further below about the script).\n\n\n*\n\n*In the current setup, a group of windows can be created by adding the frontmost window to the group by calling the script below with the argument: a. In the screen cast, I added the command to a (Unity) launcher, on Gnome, it could be done with a shortcut key.\n\n*Subsequently, if the script is called with the argument r after one of the grouped windows is moved, the script moves all windows from the group likewise, restoring the windows, relative to each other:\n\n\nHow it is done\n\n\n*\n\n*Run with the option a, the script further below adds the currently active window, its position and size (as in the corresponding line in the output of wmctrl -lG), to a file, wgroup_data.txt (in ~).\n\n*Run with the option r, the script reads the file, looks for the window that changed position, calculates the vector between the old- and the new position and moves the other windows accordingly.\n\n*If a window is closed, it is automatically removed from the group list by the script.\n\n\nSo far no problem.\nIssues\nHowever, if one of the windows does not fully fit inside the current workspace's borders, the script fails.

However, when I reopen my vimtutor I can't see the preferences I made. \nI also created another text file in a different folder to see that my preferences are working and they are. So why aren't they being used by my vimtutor file?\n\nA: From man vimtutor:\nVim is always started in Vi compatible mode.\n\nFrom man vim:\n-C    Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.  This will make Vim behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.\n\nSo when you start vimtutor, it starts in compatible mode, which ignores your vimrc file.\nThe meat of vimtutor is really just a text file, though.  Nothing special about it, other than the fact that (a) it makes a copy of the tutor file so it can be modified without changing the original file, and (b) it always starts in vi compatible mode.\nIf you want to open the tutor text file (a copy of it) using your vimrc settings instead of with vi compatible mode, run vimtutor, then type :w myvimtutorfile to save the text file in your current directory.  Next, enter :q! to exit vimtutor, and then at the command line enter vim myvimtutorfile, and you should see your .vimrc settings take effect.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu to Notebook through SD Card with only 128Mb or Ram?

I would recommend something like Puppy Linux or even Tiny Core Linux, but no Ubuntu Version can Support that hardware. As for installing, it should work with an SD, as long as you have access to BIOS. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Some research indicates that the model with the specs you've provided is a CPU that is ARM. Given that the specs are so low this also really limits your choices because you will probably want something already compiled for the architecture. \nWhat I have found is that SLiTaz has a Linux version that is aimed at the Raspberry Pi (a handy little critter with ARM CPUs). I have absolutely no way to check to verify this but you can try this if you're daring.\nhttp://arm.slitaz.org/rpi/\nAnother option is to use the search function at DistroWatch and see what pops up and looks interesting - keep in mind that you're very limited. 2 GB of space isn't much these days.

That applies to all special characters—parentheses included.  Put a backslash before the open paren and another backslash before the close paren and it will work.\nTab completion is helpful in these cases...if you start typing the filename and then press Tab, it will auto-complete the rest of the filename, inserting backslashes where necessary.  (If you haven't typed enough of the filename for it to be unambiguous which file you mean, bash will still autocomplete as much of the filename as it can.  Pressing tab twice will show a list of possible completions of the filename.)\n\nA: I agree with snoop that the way to do this is to use \" marks when you specify a file or directory.\nHowever, if there are a whole bunch of directories that need to be renamed, you can use rename to rename them to friendlier names. Rename works similar to sed except rename renames files and directories whereas sed is usually used to edit the contents of files. Here is an example:\nrename 's/ //g;s/\\(//g;s/\\)//g' ~/folder1/*\n\nSo, if you had the following directories located in ~/folder1:\nHuman (2012)\nHuman (2011)\nHuman (2010)\n\nthey will be renamed to this instead:\nHuman2012\nHuman2011\nHuman2010\n\nRun the following command for more information:\nman rename\n\n\nA: You could double quote your path:\ncd ~/\"folder1/Human (2012)\"\n\nor you should provide escape sequence for (,) and  (space) (as these are special characters):\ncd ~/folder1/Human\\ \\(2012\\)\n\nand\nmv ~/\"folder1/Human (2012)\"\n\nWith escape sequence:\nmv ~/folder1/Human\\ \\(2012\\)\n\n", "Q: Different versions of Wine Sorry if this is a duplicate, but can you guys please help me out?\nI noticed that there are four different \"Wine\" programs in the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\"Microsoft Windows Compatability Layer (meta-package)\"\n\"Q4Wine\"\n\"Wine Windows Program Loader\"\n\"Play On Linux\"\nI just installed all four.\nI read that Play on Linux is the best one. Was it unnecesarry to install all four? Are they going to interfere with each other? Do I need to uninstall some of them, or can I just keep all four, and use the one I like? Any other tips?\n\nA: \"Microsoft Windows Compatibility Layer (meta-package)\"\nIs a meta package, it contains all the meta data (info on required libs etc) for installing wine on your distribution.\n\"Wine Windows Program Loader\"\nThis is wine program itself.\n\"Q4wine\"\nQ4Wine will help you manage wine prefixes and installed applications, a front end for wine configuration.\n\"Play on Linux\"\nAgain this is a front end for wine that focuses more on installing games.\n\"Was it unnecessary to install all four? Are they going to interfere with each other?\"\nWell play on linux and Q4wine require wine of course and both are useful in there own way, so no worries there, and the meta package simply points to and installs wine and any other requirements (probably Q4wine too), so no issues there. the frontends aren't required but are great for beginners.\n\nA: This is entirely down to preference, there are also versions of it which are more \"User friendly\" and offer graphic interfaces to automate everything but cost money to use. Personally I just use Wine provided by \nsudo apt-get install wine \nnever had issues with it, but some people prefer the alternatives.\n", "Q: Where are the mythtv-setup backend start/stop scripts in 15.04 According to https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Setup_General#Backend_Control, ubuntu supplies scripts to start and stop the backend, ignoring the setting in mythtv-setup.  Where are those scripts?  On my 15.04 system, they are still attempting to use upstart to do this, which of course doesn't work as 15.04 uses systemd.\n\nA: It turns out the web page is wrong.  What was throwing me off was that you can't use sudo (as suggested on the mythtv-setup page), that hangs the shutdown (I assume it's asking for the password on the terminal), you need to use kdesudo.\n", "Q: Increase number of inodes on a disk Can I increase number of inodes on a disk?

How does the Ubuntu team assures that bugs won't appear again?\nI have seen it several times. A package is unusable after installing.\nYes, sometimes the bugs get fixed very fast.\nBut I see no effort to improve the automated testing, so that the bug won't appear again.\nHere are two examples which affected me during the last two weeks:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vsftpd/+bug/1219857\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847\nThere are more examples, but listing them is not part of the question.\nOne comment from the vsftp bug page:\n\nPlease help us by testing this new package. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed. Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.\n\nOK, but \"testing\" in the above quote is manual testing.\nTo ensure quality automated testing is needed.\nFor me manual testing is a waste of time. On the other hand, building automated tests does ensure quality.\nHere again the question:\nHow does the Ubuntu team assures that bugs don't appear again?\nHistory of this question\nFirst the title was \"How does the Ubuntu team do assure that bugs don't appear again?\". Now it is \"How does the Ubuntu team do automated testing?\".\nThis was done because I believe that manual testing is not a solution. Please don't down-vote answers which only explain the way manual testing is done. \n\nA: Ubuntu does have automated testing. For example, automated testing is used to prevent your first bug example happening again. I was the one who fixed the first vsftpd bug you mentioned, and while doing so I also added an automated test to prevent the same thing from happening again. You can see this in the changelog entry that was posted to the bug itself:\nvsftpd (3.0.2-1ubuntu2.14.04.1) trusty; urgency=medium\n\n  * d/p/ubuntu-seccomp-gettimeofday.patch: permit gettimeofday() for logging\n    calls (LP: #1219857).\n  * Add dep8 smoke test.\n -- Robie Basak <robie.basak@ubuntu.com> Tue, 29 Apr 2014 15:33:07 +0000\n\nI don't know why you consider the bug an example of a lack of automated testing, as I make multiple mentions of this in the bug. For example I said \"dep8 test added to detect this in the future\" and \"The included dep8 test automatically verifies the fix for this bug\" in the summary.\nRemember that Ubuntu is a distribution: it is an integrated aggregration of many external projects that we call upstreams. Ubuntu wouldn't be possible without the work of others in the wider Free Software ecosystem, and likewise we are often dependent on the upstream authors to provide tests since they are the experts in their software.\nFurther, as we are an aggregation of different projects, a single automatic testing infrastructure doesn't make sense. Different areas have different needs. So our testing strategy is quite widespread to match these needs, covering both manual and automated testing through a number of different infrastructures.\nWhere upstream projects provide automated tests, we run them as part of the package build. The package build fails if the tests do not pass. Making sure that any available automated testing is enabled in this fashion is part of our requirements for main inclusion: If the package ships a test suite, and there is no obvious reason why it cannot work during build (e. g. it needs root privileges or network access), it should be run during package build, and a failing test suite should fail the build.\nAdditionally we run \"automatic as-installed package testing\" based on a specification called dep8, which is designed for testing that the integration between packages work correctly. Package updates that regress dep8 tests do not go through to the development release until they are fixed.\nI am less familiar with the automated testing done by the desktop and phone teams, but I know that more mechanisms exist because I have seen references to them over the years, and this includes automated GUI testing which I think is quite impressive. I welcome another answer that covers automated desktop and phone testing.\n\nA: A number of ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Many eyes.\nUbuntu is Open Source, meaning anyone can look at the code and see what the issue is. People who are interested in looking at the code will often find bugs in it, or as they use it, and report them on launchpad and the public can even fix them.\n\nWhen you have tested it and suggested the fix you request a merge with the main Ubuntu package. Other developers review this change and if approved will add it in.\nBecause anyone can fix them they are spotted quickly, and they are reviewed, they're less likely to hang around for a while. This leads onto the next point.\nThese eyes also include computer eyes:\n\nThe upstream QA process must be documented/demonstrated and linked from the SRU tracking bug. In other cases where such upstream automatic testing is not available...\n\nWhich shows that normally automatic testing is in place.\n\n*Beta Releases\nBefore Ubuntu is released to the public, there are beta versions. Currently is the 15.10 Beta, to be released on the 22nd of October 2015. Lots, and lots of people will have been using, reviewing and bug fixing this before it is release (for 5 months 22 days in this case).\nThis means that any bugs are removed promptly (because of the Many Eyes), and typical users are unaffected because it's fixed before it's officially released.\n\n*Expert code writers\nPeople who are good at writing high quality code are the people who are writing the code. There isn't just one person sitting writing Ubuntu like this:\n\nThere are people from all around the world, and people employed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. All these people contribute a little bit of new code. If I write 2000 lines of code, there will be a lot of bugs. If 200 people write just 10, there will be a lot less.\n\n*Stable Foundations\nAs far as I know, Ubuntu is not rewritten from the ground up each time there is a new release. Instead, the next version starts of as the current version (i.e. on 2015/04/30 both 15.10 and 15.04 were the same) and new features are added from there.\nIf you have a good base to work from, then you have less code to write, and can trust what already exists. If you can rely on what's there, less bugs will get in.\n\n*Versioning and recording software\nIf the same bug comes up more than once (in different versions, or the fix didn't work, or the bug came back due to another patch) then they have the documentation to explain how it was fixed - and they can fix it again.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there are no automated tests. But what is an automated test? If it compiles, is that one? You can't just say \"automated tests\" without explaining what it is\n\nA: Dont write code with bugs. lol ok. I lost the will to write a detailed responce to this. Here's a decent article:\nhttps://www.iiitd.edu.in/~jalote/papers/CommonBugs.pdf\nand here is a good book about making mistakes in C++\nThe best answer might be to just undertake some software development tasks, and see, for yourself where the problems come from. Handling unexpected input/ results is a pretty huge issue in my experience. Then there is down stream bugs. Like someone finds a vulnerability in iostream.h and every peice of software that calls that library then might also have that bug, need at least to be reviewed. \nas for automated testing, it does exist, but it also has limitations. I'm not aware of a single solution that works on every language. If you're really interested, write us a genetic code debugger with some AI. As far as I know, all of it is still in its infancy, Heres some work from PhD students:\nhttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clegoues/docs/legoues-icse09.pdf\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu version is better? LTS or recently released version? Which Ubuntu version is better? LTS version or recently released version?\n\nA: I have recently update to Ubuntu Mate 15.04 (old dual core 2.2Ghz 2Mb RAM x86 architecture). I have had a few issues with some applications, such as the Clementine music player related to codecs (not having the right ones and an easy fix). I also use the 64-bit version on a more recent laptop (dual boot with Windows 10), and no problems there. On both machines, faster speeds were noticed and I have had no stability related problems.\nIf you want to have a more stable version, I think LTS might be better, especially if you do not wish to update again soon (possibly). But that is the only advantage with LTS I can think of. \n\nA: I did the same search on askubuntu and google before installing my system around a month back. Rather than opinion I will lay down my facts;\n\n\n*\n\n*I used LTS versions so far 12.04 and 14 on my laptops without any\nissue and with peace of mind that I am on long term release and would\nnot have to upgrade in near future.\n\n*I recently brought a new laptop (not cutting edge by any standard). Its a Lenovo-G40. My experience with 14.04 release was not good to a point that I did install Windows in dual boot. I dont know every search I did, pointed to the fact that 15.04 is not going to be useful (since the bug fixes etc are going to be back ported in 14.04 anyways , etc etc . \n\n*However I gave it a shot (15.04 , 64 bit version) , and I am just loving it - speed , graphics, overall comfort feeling.\n\n", "Q: How to lock Deluge's configuration files to prevent their modification? I'm setting up a seedbox for 3 users on Ubuntu Server 15.04. Each user runs his copy of deluged and deluge-web and has its home directory where deluge's configuration files reside. I optimized the files for speed and now I'd like to lock them to prevent them from any change (so that the users can't change config with deluge-web ui or deluge client). \nWhat I tried is:\nI chowned the files by root (and removed world permissions) but then they just get deleted and swapped by a new configuration file by deluged. I also gave them +i attribute with chattr so that even root cannot modify/delete the files without removing the \"i\" flag but then deluged just creates a new conf file: core.conf.new which can be modified by deluge-web ui.\nHow do I lock the files. Is there any other way to prevent users from modifying deluge's configuration? For now, I'd like to lock core.conf and ltconfig.conf in every users directory and force deluge to use these config files but if there's any other way I'd be happy to hear it.\n\nA: Deluge only reads the conf files on startup so although you can prevent settings being saved to disk they will still be applied in code, until next restart. A file such as core.conf.new does not mean that the application has updated core.conf, it is simply a temporary file. \nThe only option would be to modify the ConfigManager code or use the development version of Deluge that has multi-user support but there is no time-scale for release.\n\nA: Although I do use deluge with multiple users, I run multiple deluged instances. Each instance uses its own directory and core.conf. To do this, when launching deluged, you want to include the option to use a specific core.conf. For example: \n/usr/bin/deluged -d -c /storage/delgsvr10 -L warning -l /storage/delgsvr10/deluged.log\n\nThis command launches deluged with options of -d -c -L -l. Run deluged -h to get the definition of each option. Note when specifying the configuration file you just specify the directory, not the file. This works on version 1.3.6 at least.\n", "Q: How to copy files from testdrive I had win 10 and I installed ubuntu. During the process I formatted the entire hard drive.

Use another USB device or pendrive to copy the files to. If you don't have another USB device or pendrive, you can also copy to a writable DVD or CD.

How to install gnome 3.18 on that Ubuntu version?\n\nA: The basic problem I think is that 14.04 is too old library wise for versions newer than 3.12 (similar subject covered here). You would need to wait for 16.04, or use 15.10 and the GNOME PPAs to get something easily that would work (15.10 is currently in Beta but due to be released later this month). The LTS releases are supposed to be stable, so aren't always up to date with stuff.\nThe only place I have been able to vaguely use Gnome 3.18 is in Fedora 23 Beta (which I think is still roughly the same as the official Gnome Next image) - it probably is also available via ArchLinux.\nUbuntu is usually behind on Gnome releases - they have just got most of Gnome 3.14 in 15.04 - and you can get 3.16 with 15.10's Beta. With the 15.10 you probably can use the Gnome Staging PPA to bump the version to 3.18 - it also the same same for 15.04 and 3.16). \nLast Updated: 04/10/2015 for those thinking in future \"Aren't we on Gnome 5.2 now?\"\n", "Q: Setting up Xubuntu alongside 14.04 I have the Xubuntu downloaded. xubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i386.iso ,,,,I am now running on Ubuntu 14.04, side by side WIN 7. I downloaded Xubuntu iso as per suggestion, to overcome slow running of 14,04\nThe Question is: How do I Set up Xubuntu, side by side 14.04? Can I do that without CD? Please Help\n\nA: Xubuntu is Ubuntu, but with an alternate desktop environment. Just run sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop in a terminal. Then log out and click the gear icon that appears next to your name in the password box. Select Xubuntu Desktop (it might be XFCE) from the menu and log back in. You'll now be in Xubuntu. If you want to switch back, just select Ubuntu Desktop in that same menu.\n\nA: PART ONE:\nBefore you begin, you will need to allocate free space to create a partition to install xubuntu on.\nOtherwise, if you plan to shrink the windows partition instead, proceed.\nIt is possible to use unetbootin to install without a CD. First, install unetbootin:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nThen, start unetbootin: \nsudo -i unetbootin\n\nDown on the lower left, put a dot by clicking the option for disk image. Make sure ISO is selected and all the way to the right, click on  . . .  and navigate to the xubuntu iso image you downloaded earlier.\nNext, for Space used to preserve files across reboots, select 0(zero).\nClick on the drop-down menu for Type: and select Hard Disk. \nLeave the Drive: set to / and then click  OK .\n\nPART TWO:\nNow, when you reboot, you should have a couple of extra options on your grub menu. Choose either unetbootin or install xubuntu or something similar.\nSometimes, one of these may not work and you may have to choose the other if one of these options does not successfully boot.\nNext, when you get to the part of the installation where it asks if you would like to install xubuntu alongside windows or alongside your existing operating system . . . choose the option \"something else\".\nFrom here you will be able to right click on the unallocated space or the partition you wish to resize.\nAs discussed earlier, you will not be able to resize your existing Ubuntu partition through this option because Unetbootin is installed on that partition and you cannot edit a partition while it is mounted. If you like, you can resize (shrink) your existing windows partition from this menu. \nAnyhow, right click on the unallocated space you wish to use for Xubuntu, select create new partition, select ext4 as the** type** and set the mountpoint to /. \nIf a swap partition does not exist, you will want to create one now, however, don't worry about creating a new swap partition as you can share the existing swap partition. \nWhen you have finished partitioning, proceed with the installation as normal.\n", "Q: Cannot install Wine, error message is not descriptive of the problem When I try to install wine, this happens:\nsudo apt-get install wine\nReading package lists...

This is discouraged.\nBuild ended at 2015-10-04 17:20:16\n\nAny idea for a solution?\n\nA: The problem is that if you manually go to the link to the file downloaded before the error, you can see that at a point all archives are .deb and no more .tar.xz. So, the /usr/lib/uck/customization-profiles/localized_cd/customize_iso has to be changed in order to expand the new file format, and find the files in its new path.\nFully solved here, with the full script text.\nIt has been updated to the last archives format. Plus miscs.\n\nA: The bug is rather common and there is a fix avaiable on Launchpad in the form of a .diff file. By applying the patch manually it worked. patch didn't work properly for some reason.\nIt is caused by the package receiving a different compression between the update from 14.04 to 14.10.\n", "Q: Useless processes in Ubuntu 14.04 virtual server I've used Ubuntu for my desktop for a quite while now and I have successfully migrated my only CentOS web production server to Ubuntu 14.04 x64 a little over 3 months ago and I couldn't be happier.\nIt is a virtualized server with few resources in a VMWare like environment.\nAren't there some totally useless services (like acpid - which I understand is for the power button... my VPS doesn't have one) that I could turn off in order to have less processes running?\nThere must be some others that can be turned off...\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\nHere is my list of services starting at boot, from which I've removed the ones I can't part from :\nacpid\napport\natd\nbootmisc.sh\ncheckfs.sh\ncheckroot-bootclean.sh\ncheckroot.sh\ncloud-config\ncloud-final\ncloud-init\ncloud-init-container\ncloud-init-local\ncloud-init-nonet\ncloud-log-shutdown\nconsole-font\nconsole-setup\ncontainer-detect\ncontrol-alt-delete\ncron\ndbus\ndmesg\ndns-clean\nfailsafe\nflush-early-job-log\nfriendly-recovery\ngrub-common\nhwclock\nhwclock-save\nirqbalance\nkmod\nmountall\nmountall-bootclean.sh\nmountall-net\nmountall-reboot\nmountall.sh\nmountdevsubfs.sh\nmounted-debugfs\nmounted-dev\nmounted-proc\nmounted-run\nmounted-tmp\nmounted-var\nmountkernfs.sh\nmountnfs-bootclean.sh\nmountnfs.sh\nmtab.sh\nondemand\npasswd\nplymouth\nplymouth-log\nplymouth-ready\nplymouth-shutdown\nplymouth-splash\nplymouth-stop\nplymouth-upstart-bridge\npppd-dns\nprocps\nquotarpc\nrc\nrc-sysinit\nrc.local\nrcS\nresolvconf\nrsync\nrsyslog\nsaslauthd\nscreen-cleanup\nsetvtrgb\nshutdown\nsystemd-logind\nudev\nudev-fallback-graphics\nudev-finish\nudevmonitor\nudevtrigger\nupstart-file-bridge\nupstart-socket-bridge\nupstart-udev-bridge\nureadahead-other\nwait-for-state\n\n\nA: A lot of this stuff runs at boot time, but doesn't stay in memory.

You can't install packages for GUI representation, so that presumably means using command line stuff that will already be present.  Try this command which will list the biggest files and directories in order by size:\ndu -max / | grep -P '^\\d{3}' | sort -th\n\nThe numbers are the size in megabytes.\nHopefully you'll spot some big stuff that you can do without.\n", "Q: How do i clear my cache on firefox I am trying to write and I have no idea how to I am a beginner and I'm not advanced THANK YOU. I tried using the terminal and entering the codes people suggested!\n\nA: Are you sure you are asking about cache or cookies \nTo clear cache :\nGo to preferences >> Advanced >> Network >> Cached webcontent \nthere click on clear now\nTo clear cookies:\nGo to preferences >> Privacy,\nthere you can clear cookies\n\nA: Just use Firefox itself. Click on the little three line menu button, click on preferences, and click on the privacy link that is on the left. Once you're there you can click on the option to delete all of your cache, some of you cache, cache from a certain time frame, etc. While you're there you can adjust the history settings if that is something you'd like to add as well.\n", "Q: Zoom a Single Window I have a 4 k display which is great. I can fit a lot of stuff in there and most applications have a big enough font which can be easily read even in a quarter of the intended area (when designed for full hd). However, there are some applications with a too small font size which makes it hard to read what they say.\nFinding options to zoom the entire desktop (on demand) isn't hard, but I only want to zoom specific windows. It this possible, too?\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.04 with Unity.\n\nA: Here is a script called run_scaled which uses xpra to run a single application in a scaled environment:\nhttps://github.com/kaueraal/run_scaled\n", "Q: Microsoft Office to Libre Office without change it settings I installed ubuntu but all my documents are in MS office formats. Now, if I open MS word file in Libre Office Writer. It opens the file but makes a lot of changings in settings, fonts and other indentations. Any solution?\n\nA: The only application that is guaranteed to correctly open MS Office documents is MS Office.\nYou knew that (or you should) when you used it in the first time: you have been storing your data using a closed, proprietary format, managed by a closed, proprietary set of applications.\nLibreOffice tries to read MS Office documents the best it can. It uses a mix of reverse-engineering the files and using the published OOXML \"standard\" to do this, but the conversion is not perfect (and probably it never will be). This is due to complexity of the files, closeness and sometimes different philosophies in the program design (just as an example, background color and highlight are treated in fundamentally different ways in LO and MS Word, and similar things happen to some of the conditional formatting in spreadsheets). Most documents that use VBA (Visual Basic Macros) will not work. \nNow, you can try to minimize damage (having the exactly same fonts installed helps a lot, although some of the standard fonts in MS Office are non-free), and LO 5 is reportedly better at it, but in the end, you will not have the exact same document unless you buy and use MS Office.\n\nA: Do you have the same fonts on Ubuntu as you had for Windows? Even a one pixel difference in a font metric can cause the entire document to reformat, and the results can be significant, although if you really know what you're doing, it can be much less so.  Lines will rewrap, but if you don't do layout that depends on font size, it shouldn't be a major change.  So the first thing to do is to make sure you install all the fonts that are used in the document, and see how it looks then.\nOther changes are due to different defaults.  If you don't specify things like padding in tables, around images, etc, you might find a big change due to different defaults.  If you always set everything, it should come out more or less the same.  But again, anything that depends on font size might change. \nIf you were to give a word file to another word user who has customized a lot of defaults, your document might look different there, too.\n", "Q: I'm Having many problems after last update, can anybody help me? I'm using Lubuntu 14.04 and since last update I got the exactly same software update screen a few times now. Pcmanfm is unchecked and I cannot check it. Also I cannot open synaptics package manager anymore and when I make a new panel pcmanfm crashes and I have to restart my computer. Lxappearence also doesn't have openbox opions anymore.  Can anybody help me here? I have no idea what to do.\n\nA: Run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade in the terminal  That should enable you to download and install all upgrades that are available.\n", "Q: New Install 14.04, Dell 2720 AIO, kernal error New install on a Windows based Dell 2720 with 32GB SSD reconfigured as non-cache disk.

Ubuntu showed a dialog box with options to select NVidia, but wouldn't accept them, and enforces the generic Nouveau option, resulting in the same problem. I can't remember if it was during a reinstall attempt or running in USB \"try Ubuntu\" mode.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Resolved. Default Noveau x-windows driver problem caused either pink splash screen or hex trace diagnostics. Found http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132.

I've only been using USB to install Ubuntu and it's been great. It works on most computers.. It only failed me once on a 10 years old machine.\nIf you already have ubuntu installed somewhere then getting UNetbootin is easy just open a terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and type sudo apt-get unetbootin. \nElse you can download a windows version from the website. \nBootable USB works the same way as a disk you only need to boot from USB obviously.  \n", "Q: What does `ls /` do? Running the ls / command some files are coming out;\nWhat are those files?\nThey are not even directories.\nOutput of ls /:\nbin dev boot etc cdrom media mnt home lib lib64 proc root\n\n\nA: ls / lists the contents of the root directory.  (Elsewhere I wrote an explanation of the various meanings of the word root, which you can read here.)\nThe files that are showing up in the output are indeed directories, as you can easily verify by running ls -p /.  The -p flag will cause ls to append a slash to every directory listed, so you can differentiate them from files that are listed.\nThe source of the confusion seems to be that you don't understand what is called the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy.  There are specific directories in specific locations, each with a specific purpose.  For example, /etc (pronounced \"slash et-see\") contains configuration files; you can think of the name etc as an acronym for \"editable text configuration.\"\nEach of the directories in the output of ls / have a specific purpose.  The full reference material explaining this can be found here.  For a decent primer on the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy, written for those familiar with Windows, try here.\nEven more fundamental than the purpose of all these directories is the concept that ALL files and directories on Linux are part of a single directory \"tree\".  Do a google image search for \"directory tree\" if the term \"tree\" seems confusing.  Unlike Windows where you have various drives (the C: drive, the D: drive and so on), in Linux, mounted drives are tied in to the rest of the directory tree at a \"mount point\", which is just another directory.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Arduino Due upload firmware issue I have Arduino Due on SAM3x8e.

It seems it actually hangs up, due to it loads 99% of CPU... May be Ubuntu update caused this issue...?\ndmesg\n[ 5168.658692] usb 3-3: new full-speed USB device number 7 using xhci_hcd\n[ 5168.676969] usb 3-3: New USB device found, idVendor=2341, idProduct=003d\n[ 5168.676979] usb 3-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=220\n[ 5168.676985] usb 3-3: Product: Arduino Due Prog.

To then perform an update, run sudo apt-get upgrade. I use the sudo command so that I do not need to be logged in as root to perform the updates. \nThere are also some updates which will not upgrade with this command, and the command sudo apt-get dist-upgrade must be used on these.\n", "Q: Can I send data from my old Windows 7 to Ubuntu? I recently downloaded Ubuntu to run side by side by my Windows but Ubuntu only has 10gb of space and Windows has 130gb. Is it possible to send data from my Windows to Ubuntu? because I find Linux better for gaming and I need a lot more space than 10gb to run all those games. \n\nA: You can access any partition you can access via Windows via Ubuntu (but not the other way around). This includes your system partition.\nIf you have an external storage device (usb stick, external hard drive), you can copy your data from the Windows partition to that device. Then remove it from the Windows partition (clean trash). After you did so, boot the PC with a live usb stick, launch GParted, decrease the size of the Windows partition, and increase the one of the Ubuntu partition. Then boot Ubuntu and copy the files back from the usb stick / external hard drive.\nBut remember that things can go wrong when changing partitions. Make a backup in advance, in case for example the power goes down and you're on a computer without backup power supply. Also, depending on your version of Windows, it may fail to boot after you played with the partitions. But this can be solved pretty easily by inserting the Windows DVD.\n", "Q: Need help installing a texture pack on Minecraft So i need help installing a texture pack on minecraft. I don't know if this is the right site to ask but it has to do with ubuntu mostly. So every time I go on minecraft and \"open texture pack folder\" it gives me like a link on chrome to the file. I tried to put the texture pack in the browser but it didn't work. So now im trying to figure out how to find the .minecraft folder. \nNote: It says I'm not the owner of the laptop but I am.\n\nA: The .minecraft folder on Ubuntu is located at ~/.minecraft which, when expanded is /home/username/.minecraft. It is hidden, so you'll either have to open it with the terminal (nautilus ~/.minecraft) or by pressing CTRL+H inside of ~/ (your Home directory) to show hidden files and folders. I'm not exactly sure why the button isn't working, but that's probably not really Ubuntu related.\n", "Q: Choice of repositories and link with Software Updater warning message \"Not all updates can be installed\"? I am on Xubuntu 14.04. I don't understand the cause of the following warning message I get.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I check only the Universe repository, Software Updater tells me that my system is up to date.\n\n*When I check the following repositories in Software Updater:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main\n\n*Universe\n\n*Restricted\n\n\nI get a list of package to update. Up to now, everything is sound.\n\n*Now, if I check only the following repositories:\n\n\n*\n\n*Main\n\n*Restricted\n\n\nI get the message \"Not all updates can be installed\".\nIf I click Continue, I get a list of packages to update but a number of them are unchecked and cannot be selected:\n\n\n*\n\n*Complete Generic Linux kernel and headers\n\n*Generic Linux kernel headers\n\n*Generic Linux kernel image\n\n*GTK+ graphical user interface library\n\n*Programs for the GTK+ graphical user interface library\n\n\n\nCan it be that these packages are in the Universe repository and that I get the warning because I did not check this repository? But then, how comes I am not offered to upgrade them when I check just Universe? \nI did a sudo apt-get install -f and it says:\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 44 not upgraded\nHow can I make sense of this behavior? I know I could just check all three repositories: Main, Restricted and Universe, and just proceed to update; but I would like to get a deeper understanding.\nPS: I have 'Important security updates' and 'Recommended updates' checked and I did not check any of the Other Software repositories.\n\nA: So after some research, here is what I understood.\nAbout the Utopic packages in my 14.04.3 Trusty Thar release\nAccording to the Release Note for Trusty Tahr, if one instals Ubuntu directly from the 14.04.2 media (which I did) one automatically receives a newer hardware enablement stack by default. This is maybe why I have the packages: linux-generic-lts-utopic, linux-headers-generic-lts-utopic and linux-image-generic-lts-utopic.\nAlthough I am not 100% sure since (i) the Trusty Tahr Release Note mostly refer to the vivd-based packages, and (ii) I had essentially just some documentation files referring to 'utopic' under /etc/share. So still a bit of a mystery...\nAbout the \"held back\" packages\nThe explanation can be found here. These are upgrades of packages that have new dependencies that require the installation of new packages. To prevent the automatic installation of such new packages (not just upgrades) that could potentially put the system at risk, the upgrades are held back.\nThe command to force the installation of these held back upgrades along with their required dependencies is:\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nI used the command and everything went fine.\n", "Q: Will enabling ufw through ssh disrupt current session? I have an ubuntu server that I access through SSH. I've changed standart port (22) to something else. I want to enable ufw on this machine. However, I'm afraid of the possibility of the following scenario occuring: as soon as I enable ufw, it'll start with default settings blocking connections and kicks me from server, especially since I'm connecting through non-standart port. Will that happen? Should I prepare some configuration first or start ufw right away? SSH is the only way of accessing my server, so loosig this due to firewall would be a disaster.\nI also have some applications using some ports for UDP and TCP connections. Will these ports be automatically blocked after I enable ufw? Will I need to add exceptions for them after enabling it?\n\nI've probably found what I wanted, but I need a confirmation from somebody.\nI haven't enabled ufw yet, but I've ran some configuration commands.\nFirst I did sudo ufw ssh\nSecond sudo ufw  my_new_ssh_port_here\nThen I had a look at /lib/ufw/user.rules\nThis is part of the file:\n### RULES ###\n\n### tuple ### allow any 22 0.0.0.0/0 any 0.0.0.0/0 in\n-A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-user-input -p udp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n### tuple ### allow any 1111 0.0.0.0/0 any 0.0.0.0/0 in\n-A ufw-user-input -p tcp --dport 1111 -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-user-input -p udp --dport 1111 -j ACCEPT\n\n### END RULES ###\n\nHave I set it up to allow ssh connection through my new port successfully? Is it safe to start now or do I need to configure anything else?\nI'm still not sure, because sudo ufw show raw doesn't seem to show anything helpful and sudo ufw status verbose still shows Status: inactive only\n\nA: Ya. It may. Based on the default configurations. You can check the present configuration by using the following command sudo ufw show raw. The command will show the configuration of all policy's rules in iptable.\n", "Q: Why does Skype 4.3 look so outdated (old) in Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit)?

However, This* returns the above line as expected.\nWhether the expression is enclosed in quotes makes no difference.\nI thought the asterisk indicated any number of unknown characters? Why does it only work if it's at the start of the expression? If this is intended behavior, what do I use instead of the expressions This*String and *String?\n\nA: The * metacharacter in BRE1s, ERE1s and PCRE1s matches 0 or more occurences of the previously grouped pattern (if a grouped pattern is preceding the * metacharacter), 0 or more occurences of the previous character class (if a character class is preceding the * metacharacter) or 0 or more occurences of the previous character (if neither a grouped pattern nor a character class is preceding the * metacharacter);\nThis means that in the This*String pattern, being the * metacharacter not preceded either by a grouped pattern or a character class, the * metacharacter matches 0 or more occurences of the previous character (in this case the s character):\n% cat infile               \nThisExampleString\nThisString\nThissString\n% grep 'This*String' infile\nThisString\nThissString\n\nTo match 0 or more occurences of any character, you want to match 0 or more occurences of the . metacharacter, which matches any character:\n% cat infile               \nThisExampleString\n% grep 'This.*String' infile\nThisExampleString\n\nThe * metacharacter in BREs and EREs is always \"greedy\", i.e. it will match the longest match:\n% cat infile\nThisExampleStringIsAString\n% grep -o 'This.*String' infile\nThisExampleStringIsAString\n\nThis may not be the desired behavior; in case it's not, you can turn on grep's PCRE engine (using the -P option) and append the ? metacharacter, which when put after the * and + metacharacters has the effect of changing their greediness:\n% cat infile\nThisExampleStringIsAString\n% grep -Po 'This.*?String' infile\nThisExampleString\n\n\n1: Basic Regular Expressions, Extended Regular Expressions and Perl Compatible Regular Expressions\n\nA: One of explanation found here link:\n\nAsterisk \"*\" does not mean the same thing in regular expressions as in wildcarding; it is a modifier that applies to the preceding single character, or expression such as [0-9]. An asterisk matches zero or more of what precedes it. Thus [A-Z]* matches any number of upper-case letters, including none, while [A-Z][A-Z]* matches one or more upper-case letters. \n\n\nA: * has a special meaning both as a shell globbing character (\"wildcard\") and as a regular expression metacharacter. You must take both into account, though if you quote your regular expression then you can prevent the shell from treating it specially and ensure that it passes it unchanged to grep. Although sort of similar conceptually, what * means to the shell is quite different from what it means to grep.\nFirst the shell treats * as a wildcard.\nYou said:\n\nWhether the expression is enclosed in quotes makes no difference.\n\nThat depends on what files exist in whatever directory you happen to be in when you run the command. For patterns that contain the directory separator /, it may depend on what files exist across your whole system. You should always quote regular expressions for grep--and single quotes are usually best--unless you are sure you are okay with the nine types of potentially surprising transformations the shell otherwise performs before executing the grep command.\nWhen the shell encounters a * character that is not quoted, it takes it to mean \"zero or more of any character\" and replaces the word that contains it with a list of filenames that match the pattern. (Filenames that start with . are excluded--unless your pattern itself starts with . or you've configured your shell to include them anyway.) This is known as globbing--and also by the names filename expansion and pathname expansion.\nThe effect with grep will usually be that the first matching filename is taken as the regular expression--even if it would be quite obvious to a human reader that it is not meant as a regular expression--while all the other filenames listed automatically from your glob are taken as the files inside which to search for matches. (You do not see the list--it is passed opaquely to grep.) You virtually never want this to happen.\nThe reason this is sometimes not a problem--and in your particular case, at least so far, it wasn't--is that * will be left alone if all of the following are true:\n\n*\n\n*There were no files whose names matched. ...Or you have disabled globbing in your shell, typically with set -f or the equivalent set -o noglob. But this is uncommon and you would probably know you did it.\n\n\n*You are using a shell whose default behavior is to leave * alone when there are no matching filenames. This is the case in Bash, which you are probably using, but not in all Bourne-style shells. (The default behavior in  the popular shell Zsh, for instance, is for globs to either (a) expand or (b) produce an error.) ...Or you have changed this behavior of your shell--how that is done varies across shells.\n\n\n*You have not otherwise told your shell to allow globs to be replaced with nothing when there are no matching files, nor to fail with an error message in this situation. In Bash that would have been done by enabling the nullglob or failglob shell option, respectively.\nYou can sometimes rely on #2 and #3 but you can rarely rely on #1. A grep command with an unquoted pattern that works now may stop working when you have different files or when you run it from a different place. Quote your regular expression and the problem goes away.\nThen the grep command treats * as a quantifier.\nThe other answers--such as those by Sergiy Kolodyazhnyy and by kos--also address this aspect of this question, in somewhat different ways. So I encourage those who haven't read them yet to do so, either before or after reading the rest of this answer.\nAssuming the * does make it to grep--which quoting should ensure--grep then takes it to mean that the item that precedes it may occur any number of times, rather than having to occur exactly once. It could still occur once. Or it might not be present at all. Or it could be repeated. Text that fits with any of those possibilities will be matched.\nWhat do I mean by \"item\"?\n\n*\n\n*A single character. Since b matches a literal b, b* matches zero or more bs, thus ab*c matches ac, abc, abbc, abbbc, etc.\nSimilarly, since . matches any character, .* matches zero or more characters1, thus a.*c matches ac, akc, ahjglhdfjkdlgjdfkshlgc, even acccccchjckhcc, etc. Or\n\n\n*A character class. Since [xy] matches x or y, [xy]* matches zero or more characters where each one is either x or y, thus p[xy]*q matches pq, pxq, pyq, pxxq, pxyq, pyxq, pyyq, pxxxq, pxxyq, etc.\nThis also applies to shorthand forms of character classes like \\w, \\W, \\s, and \\S. Since \\w matches any word character, \\w* matches zero or more word characters. Or\n\n\n*A group. Since \\(bar\\) matches bar, \\(bar\\)* matches zero or more bars, thus foo\\(bar\\)*baz matches foobaz, foobarbaz, foobarbarbaz, foobarbarbarbaz, etc.\nWith the -E or -P options, grep treats your regular expression as an ERE or PCRE respectively, rather than as a BRE, and then groups are surrounded by ( ) instead of \\( \\), so then you'd use (bar) instead of \\(bar\\) and foo(bar)baz instead of foo\\(bar\\)baz.\nman grep gives a reasonably accessible explanation of BRE and ERE syntax at the end, as well as listing all the command-line options grep accepts at the beginning. I recommend that manual page as a resource, and also the GNU Grep documentation and this tutorial/reference site (which I've linked to a number of pages on, above).\nFor testing and learning grep, I recommend calling it with a pattern but no filename. Then it takes input from your terminal. Enter lines; the lines that are echoed back to you are the ones that contained text your pattern matched. To quit, press Ctrl+D at the beginning of a line, which signals end of input. (Or you can press Ctrl+C as with most command-line programs.) For example:\ngrep 'This.*String'\n\nIf you use the --color flag, grep will highlight the specific parts of your lines that matched your regular expression, which is very useful both for figuring out what a regular expression does and for finding what you are looking for once you do. By default, Ubuntu users have a Bash alias that causes grep --color=auto to run--which is sufficient for this purpose--when you run grep from the command line, so you likely don't even need to pass --color manually.\n1 Therefore .* in a regular expression means what * means in a shell glob. However, the difference is that grep automatically prints lines that contain your match anywhere in them, so it's typically unnecessary to have .* at the beginning or end of a regular expression.\n\nA: An asterisk in regular expressions means \"match the preceding element 0 or more times\". \nIn your particular case with grep 'This*String' file.txt, you are trying to say, \"hey, grep, match me the word Thi, followed by lowercase s zero or more times, followed by the word String\". The lowercase s is nowhere to be found in Example, hence grep ignores ThisExampleString.\nIn the case of grep '*String' file.txt, you are saying \"grep, match me the empty string--literally nothing--preceding the word String\". Of course, that's not how ThisExampleString is supposed to be read. (There are other possible meanings--you can try this with and without the -E flag--but none of the meanings are anything like what you really want here.)\nKnowing that . means \"any single character\", we could do this: grep 'This.*String' file.txt. Now the grep command will read it correctly: This followed by any character (think of it as selection of ASCII characters) repeated any number of times, followed by String.\n", "Q: two finger scrolling causing a right click (ubuntu 15.04) When I use two finger scrolling, and then remove my fingers from the touchpad, it is causing a right click at the end.\nFor example, I'll be scrolling down a wikipedia page.

If I grep a file containing the following:\nThese are words\nThese are words\nThese are words\nThese are words\n\n...for the word These, it will print the string These are words four times.\nHow can I prevent grep from printing recurring strings more than once? Otherwise, how can I manipulate the output of grep to remove duplicate lines?\n\nA: The Unix philosophy is to have tools that do one thing and do them well.  In this case, grep is the tool that selects text from a file.  To find out if there are duplicates, one sorts the text.  To remove the duplicates, one uses the -u option to sort.  Thus:\ngrep These filename | sort -u\n\nsort has many options: see man sort.  If you want to count duplicates or have a more complicated scheme for determining what is or is not a duplicate, then pipe the sort output to uniq:  grep These filename | sort | uniq and see manuniq` for options.\n\nA: Using grep and an additional switch, if you are looking for only a single string\ngrep -m1 'These' filename\n\n\nFrom man grep\n-m NUM, --max-count=NUM\n        Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If the input is\n        standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are\n        output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned  to\n        just  after  the  last matching  line  before exiting, regardless\n        of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling\n        process to resume a search.  When grep stops after NUM matching\n        lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.  When the -c or\n        --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater\n        than NUM.

Is there any way to login a tty by some command at the beginning? \nThanks\n\nA: A simpler solution to running a program, IMHO would be to combine the --autologin flag of getty and a function that runs your desired commands from .bashrc . \nPart 1: autologin to getty\nAs you may or may not know, TTYs are opened with a getty program as a startup service in /etc/init/ directory. For Ubuntu, default program is agetty, which has --autologin flag. Thus, we can do the following:\nIn terminal run sudo nano /etc/init/tty1.conf to open init file for TTY1 (notice that TTY1 is just an example, could be whichever you choose) . Change line \nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\n\nto \nexec /sbin/getty --autologin userName    -8 38400 tty1\n\nReplace  userName with your actual userName.\nPart 2: running a function on shell login\nLinux/Unix systems have this nice little program called tty that reports what kind of terminal you are using at the moment. For instance, in gnome-terminal it would report something like\n$ tty\n/dev/pts/27\n\nIn TTY1 however it would report\n$ tty\n/dev/tty1\n\nKnowing that we can create a function at the top of our $HOME/.bashrc file\nfunction testTTY\n{\n  isTTY=$(tty | awk '{if ($0~/\\/dev\\/tty.*/) {print \"true\"}else{print \"false\"}}')\n\n  if [ $isTTY == \"true\" ]; then\n    printf \"You are in virtual console\\n\"\n    printf \"current disk usage is\"\n    df\n  fi\n}\n\nThen at the bottom of the .bashrc make a call to your function, simply as testTTY. So, define function first, call it later.\nSide notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*place custom commands between the if [];then ...fi\n\n*If you need specific TTY change isTTY code to this: isTTY=$(tty | awk '{if ($0==\"/dev/tty1\") {print \"true\"}else{print \"false\"}}')\n\nA: follow the below steps. \nFirst install mingetty:\n$ sudo apt-get install mingetty\n5.2)    Edit /etc/init/tty1.conf\n/* For making Root as default Login */\nChange: exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1 \nTo: exec /sbin/mingetty --autologin root --noclear tty1\n/* For making a normal user as default login */\nexec /bin/login -f abcuser < /dev/tty1 > /dev/tty1 2>&1\n", "Q: Lintian error: source-is-missing while building deb package for ubuntu I'm trying to build a deb package for a software. \nI'm following this tutorial for the same.\nWhen trying to build the package using bzr builddeb -- -us -uc, I'm getting a lot of lintian errors for missing files:\nE: eyeris source: source-is-missing usr/local/bin/EyeRIS/lib64/libusb-1.0.so\n\nThe files are very much present in the folder mentioned. \nI've tried adding lintian overrides but I'm still getting the errors.\nCould there be something I'm doing wrong?

The system worked fine until it broke a few days ago.\nI was creating some data file backup copying files from one data disk to another data disk (the linux system disk was not involved) using luckybackup/rsync. The files were copied correctly but it took some time so I decided to start a game using Wine/PlayOnLinux. However the game (that used to work before) did not open up. Instead two of my three screens turned black. Only the backup output window stayed visible. I stopped the backup procedure and tried to shut down the system. That failed. So I forced a shutdown and booted the system.\nNow after entering the password at login screen the cursor turns to a cross and all screens turn black. I can not do anything. Even starting some console by + does not work anymore (the mouse cursor hides but I can not see a prompt).\nI tried to login using a different account... same problem.\nThe system had rebooted fine a few minutes before. I did not install new software or updates in between.\nThere is a lot of information in the Web about black screens after login but most of these cases are outdated and/or user account related while my problem is account independant. Anyway I tried some of those tips (starting Kubuntu in safe mode) but none worked.\nSo I (desperately) need beginners level help to fix the problem (without loosing all my settings and installed software if possible).\n\nA: I finally found the problem.\nThe backup copied the files from the given source to the given target. However the target /mnt/Backup/ was not the mounted backup disk (which was /media/Backup/) but a simple folder. This means the backup files were copied to the root disk causing the root disk to completely run out of space. This is why Wine crashed and why the system stopped working. After booting in secure mode and removing the misguided backup everything seems to work fine again now.\n", "Q: How to create an bootable .iso file from Ubuntu Live USB? I have an Ubuntu 14.04 Live USB (32 GB).\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to create a bootable .iso file from the Live USB ?\n\n\nhow can I create a bootable ISO?\n\nA: It should be enough to just cat the device. If your USB is, for example, /dev/sdb, you can do:\ncat /dev/sdb > foo.img\n\nto restore the image to a USB disk, do:\ncat foo.img > /dev/sdb\n\nNote that this approach will create an image file as large as the drive itself, even if the drive is almost empty.

I am still hoping to find a way to do it with dd.\nThere are many detailed tutorials for the ISO process in Systemback and Clonezilla. I have found Systemback much more user-friendly. It has been forked within the past year or two, and even the older version works for me on Ubuntu 21.04. But Clonezilla seems to be much more enduring and widely known.

This has two annoying consequences:\n\n\n*\n\n*it causes the GUI to flinch;\n\n*the image is unintentionally moved downwards since the whole slide moves upwards as the slide auto-adjusts itself to the center of the GUI ( \"line and filling bar\" disappears, space is larger).\n\n\nWhen the image is deactivated, the bar appears again.\nI failed to turn this behavior off (toolbar customize, options, google, etc). Does anyone happen to know how to do that? TIA!\n\nA: After some googling and reading, I realize this is a context-sensitive toolbar and it is not possible to disable its auto-hide behavior. The simple trick to prevent the flinch is to insert a customized dummy toolbar, which by default is context-insensitive, before the \"line and filling\" in the same row. This way, even if the \"line and filling\" toolbar disappears upon clicking a picture in the slide, the GUI won't flinch as the customized toolbar works as a placeholder. Furthermore, you can add tools you need to your customized toolbar so you still have access to them even if the \"line and filling\" is gone.\n", "Q: Cannot boot 14.04 after upgrade I get the following error message:\nadevadm trigger is not permitted while udev is unconfigured.\nGave up waiting for root device.

I was under the impression that both the sudo password and the password that I use to login to Ubuntu are the same.

Aren't they the same ?\n\nA: \nI was under the impression that both the sudo password and the password that I use to login to Ubuntu are the same.\n\nThey are.\nIf you want a root prompt you need to type\nsudo -i\n\nwhen using the admin account. Mind though: there are not a lot of situations where you should need to use a root prompt and it is more likely you want to do something not the Ubuntu way. \nExample (in order: \"su\", wrong password using \"sudo su\", correct password): \n:~$ su\nPassword: \nsu: Authentication failure\n:~$ sudo -i\n[sudo] password for xxxxx:\nSorry, try again.    \n[sudo] password for xxxxx: \n:/home/xxxxx# \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu does not have a \"root\" account (or better: it has been disabled). So \"su\" does not work since that is tied to the \"root\" account. \"sudo -i\" is tied to your admin user and will work.\n\n\nA: If you use sudo (usually some command following it) it will ask you your login password, and you will gain root privilege.\nwhen you use su you will be asked root user password (this is not the same as your login password unless you want it to be which is not recommended)\nUsually, root user password is not set by default in Ubuntu on fresh install (in fedora you are asked to set root user password during installation). You have to set, only if you want to, root user password after installation.\nHere is how you do it:\nsudo -i\n\nenter your login password and you will get something like this:\nroot@computer:/home/edward# \n\nnow type:\npasswd\n\nnow you will be asked to set root user password.  \nSo they  are different thing.\n\nA: sudo, by default, asks for your password, which is the password you use to login. On the other hand su ask for the password of the target user which, unless specified, defaults to root. Note that by default Ubuntu has an invalid password field set for root, effectively making it impossible to login as root.\n\nA: Your username password and sudo password initially the same unless you change them.You can change the root user password using this command from the terminal \nsudo password [username] (for example , root)\nsudo -i\nsudo passwd root\nYou should be able to login to root using sudo su from the terminal and then use your password.\nHope that works for you.\n", "Q: Further username and password problems I'm new to Ubuntu.

I want to upgrade my way to 14 - understanding that I have to upgrade one version at a time, but have run into a problem. Following the directions given on the \"About Ubuntu\" page, I set the system to Normal in Software Sources, the went to the Upgrade Manager to click Check for system upgrades. I then got a message telling me my version is no longer supported, and that I need to upgrade. I can't close this message normally, but have to force quit. What is my next best course of action? Thank you for your help.\n\nA: 10.04 is an LTS release. You should be able to upgrade directly to 12.04 (the next LTS) and from there, up to 14.04 (the next LTS after 12.04). That's not as hairy as the 8 release-upgrades you were worrying about.\nHowever, a lot changed in the four years between releases. The Ubuntu Unity desktop probably won't work on ancient hardware (it might!). I would start by downloading a load of 14.04 ISOs for the lighter flavours (Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu-Mate, more here). Make a Live USB from them and try them out and see what works.\nFrom there you can either do a straight reinstall (which might be most beneficial) during an upgrade, install their whatever-desktop metapackage. Given you'd already have the ISO, a straight reinstall would likely be faster.\n\nA: Because you say the following:\n\nI am starting to reuse an old computer (windows xp era) which I\n  converted to Ubuntu 10.04 several years ago.\n\nDo yourself a favor and install a new system. If you have important data on this laptop, then back-up this data first!\nDuring installation you will be asked for the type of installation. Select Something else and make sure you do not format your home partition!\n\n\n\nA: I concur with the other answers that:\n1) You should seriously consider backing up any important data and reinstalling, rather than spending several days upgrading individual versions, which is error-prone, may break things, is not officially supported, and will take longer than reinstalling in your specific case.\n2) 10.04 LTS, as an LTS release, can be upgraded directly to 12.04 LTS, then directly to 14.04 LTS.  You can then either stop there and wait for 16.04 LTS (available in 6 months at the time of this writing), or go to 14.10 and then to 15.04, and sometime in the next few weeks 15.10. (2 or 4 updates, rather than 9 or 11)\nNow that those disclaimers are made, here's the answer to your actual question:\nTo update a non-supported version of Ubuntu, you need to change the URLs in your apt sources.list to reflect that obsolete versions of Ubuntu are moved on Canonical's servers (this is done to prevent users from complaining/providing bug reports about unsupported versions or shooting themselves in the foot with a broken upgrade, which is possible, since, as I said, unsupported).\nFirst, back up your apt sources:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak\n\nThen edit /etc/apt/sources.list with your favorite text editor (using sudo, as you must be root to edit the file), and change all URL's that include http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ (or whatever specific country server you're on) to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/  Then the dist upgrade should work.  But remember, it's unsupported and may fail or break your system, so back up everything first, if you insist on doing this.\n", "Q: How to install k-touch with terminal? How to install k-touch?

I have a problem that I cannot boot ubuntu and boot repair didnt help me. I read somewhere that when my partiton table is GPT i have to create special partition for a GRUB2, for example Windows created special partition called Windows Boot Manager . Can someone tell my if it's necessary or there is diffrent solution? Im using UEFI . It's possible that im using boot-repair wrong or smth like that. Help would be appreciated .\n\nA: You don't have to create a partition for GRUB, it was already created from Windows installation process. There already exists an EFI partition to which all the boot loaders have to be installed.\nTo achieve what you want follow these instructions, they worked in most of the similar cases:  \nFirst try to change the boot order in BIOS (UEFI) settings.\nSelect Ubuntu to be the default operating system to boot.\nIf this is not possible or the GRUB boot menu does not show up when starting your computer,\nboot into Windows and disable hibernation and Fast Boot.  \nTo disable hibernation open command prompt as administrator and execute this command:  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nTo disable Fast Boot open Control Panel (the old version - not the modern design),\nselect the Energy Settings, enable show hidden settings and uncheck Fast Boot.  \nAfter having done this shutdown the machine completely - do NOT reboot!  \nThen reinstall the GRUB boot loader to your Ubuntu installation  in EFI mode.  \nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media - then  open a terminal and execute:  \nsudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt/boot/efi\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\nsudo chroot /mnt\ngrub-install /dev/sd*\nupdate-grub  \n\nNow you can choose which operating system you want to boot from the GRUB boot loader menu.  \nNote :  \nsd* = disk | sd** = efi partition | sd*** = system partition  \nTo identify the partition numbers use GParted.\nThe tool is included in the Ubuntu install media.\n", "Q: monitor resolution reseted after reboot (one monitor) I have a computer with ONLY ONE MONITOR - these are the specs:\nUbuntu 15.04 -

For some reason, this system is having a lot of trouble running Java applications such as Eclipse and RubyMine. What happens is that within seconds of starting the application, it would simple freeze up. The only actions available are resizing the window, and the only way to kill the process is to kill -9. \nThe freezing sometimes also randomly interferes with the rest of the OS, such as preventing other (non-Java) applications from creating new windows or preventing text input in other applications, until the process is killed. Sometimes it actually freezes the entire X session and I have to kill -9 from another tty.\nI have tried multiple distributions and versions of JRE and JDK and it didn't help. The only consistent thing I've found is that this never happens on a cold boot, so a painful workaround for me is to turn off my computer for a few minutes and turn it back on.\nI think this is a hardware issue, but how do I even begin to debug this?\n\nA: You could try Oracle JDK if you're using OpenJDK.

Typical example would be:\nrmnot *tex *bib *png\n\nMy script works, but since I am inexperienced and want to learn it the proper way, is there a more elegant way to do write this script?\n#!/bin/zsh\n\ninsert=\"-name . -or -name ..\"\n\nfor i in {1..$#}; do\n    insert=\"$insert -or -name ${(P)i}\"\ndone\n\ninsert=\"\\( $insert \\)\"\n\neval \"find -not $insert -exec rm {} \\;\"\n\nPS: I have to use ZSH because of the double substitution ${(P)i} anything else would work in bash as well I think.\n======Optimized Version=====\n #!/bin/bash\n\n insert=\"-name . -or -name ..\"\n\n for i; do\n    insert=\"$insert -or -name $i\"\n done\n\n insert=\"\\( $insert \\)\"\n\n find -maxdepth 1 -not $insert -delete\n\n\nA: You don't even need a script.

When I start up my computer I get a screen with the Gnome logo with an area asking for the passphrase I selected to encrypt the drive. I am unable to type anything into that spot. Pressing the Enter key also does nothing.\nA temporarily solution I have discovered is to hold the left Shift key immediately when the computer starts and selecting the recovery option.

But the power button that shows that usage of external graphics card is always on. Does it mean it uses my GPU of external graphics card even I do not play video games or do some 3D stuff? Am I doing something wrong? What is the best way of managing external graphics card? By the way I'm using a notebook.\n\n\nA: What you're seeing is probably perfectly normal.  You should check the GPU usage and GPU temperature with some NVIDIA software (likely available from their website).  Ubuntu 14.04 had an issue with some NVIDIA GeForce cards, in that, when running the GUI, the GPU would run at 100% usage all the time, and it would quickly overheat, shortening the lifespan of the card.  This may have been fixed in an update somewhere, but it's a possibility that this issue is still out there.\nIf you have your main monitor connected to that graphics card, then you will definitely use the GPU.  The GPU is just another term for the chip on the graphics card that figures out what to send to the monitor, so if you have a desktop running with monitor output, it will be used.\nIn short, this is probably normal, but it would be a good idea to check it by the numbers.\n", "Q: Writing a script to automatically run against consecutive variables So I'm trying to to convert one format of mac address to another, i.e.. from XXXX:XXXX:XXXX to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.\nI was able to create a sed string using patterns but can only run it per mac address. Any suggestions on how to automate the script to run it against consecutive mac addresses? \nHere's an example:\n$ echo  5254.0040.8beb | sed  's/\\.//g' |  sed -e 's/\\([0-9A-Fa-f]\\{2\\}\\)/\\1:/g' -e 's/\\(.*\\):$/\\1/'\n52:54:00:40:8b:eb\n\nI don't want to run it 100x:/   \n\nA: $ echo 5254.0040.8beb | sed -r 's/\\./:/g; s/([[:xdigit:]]{2})([[:xdigit:]]{2})/\\1:\\2/g'\n52:54:00:40:8b:eb\n\n\nA: The way to do this is to save all your MAC addresses in a file, and then run the sed command on the file. Yours is needlessly complex though, try this instead:\n$ echo 5254.0040.8beb | sed 's/\\.//g; s/../&:/g; s/:$//'\n52:54:00:40:8b:eb\n\nThe first s/// removes the ., the second replaces every set of 2 characters (..) with themselves (&) and a :, and the third removes the : that the previous replacement added to the end of the line. \nTo run this on your file of MAC addresses (one address per line), do:\nsed 's/\\.//g; s/../&:/g; s/:$//' file\n\n\nA: Approach with awk: in order to work with individual characters, define field separator as blank, get rid of the dot in the original MAC address, and  print dot after every second character. For a single MAC address the code will look like this:\necho 5254.0040.8beb  | awk -F '' '{gsub(/\\./,\"\");for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){printf $i;if(i%2 == 0 && i!=NF) printf \":\"   }}'\n\nWe can turn the code into an executable script, like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a file called mac-editor.awk.

I can't see my second hard drive, which is GPT, in Linux. I mean I can't mount it or use data from it. On Windows it is all good. I load Windows8\\Ubuntu from GRUB, which uses MBR on the first HDD.\nAs I understand, Ubuntu, which is installed on the MBR hard drive, can't see another hard drive with GPT (here I have many files and documents, but no OS, and can't copy it or back it up because the size is too big).\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*How can I change GPT to MBR, without losing data on this drive?\n\n*How can I change MBR to GPT on the Ubuntu hard drive (where I have Ubuntu + Windows 8.1)?\n\n\nA: Linux should have no problem accessing a second disk, partitioned with GPT, from a BIOS-mode boot on an MBR disk. The fact that you're having problems suggests something else is wrong, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*User error -- You don't say what you're doing to attempt to access the disk or what type of error message(s) you're seeing, so it's hard to judge if you're doing the right thing or making some mistake in your attempt. I suggest you edit your question to post more details about what you're doing.\n\n*Partition table damage -- Your partition table might be damaged in some way that's causing Ubuntu to object to it but that Windows takes in stride. You can type sudo sgdisk -v /dev/sdb (or change /dev/sdb to whatever the device file for the disk is) to run a basic partition table sanity check on the disk. This command will not modify the disk in any way; it will just report any problems it finds.\n\n*Filesystem damage or unsupported filesystem -- The partition table might be fine, but if the filesystem(s) used on the disk are damaged or of a variety that Ubuntu can't understand, you won't be able to read them. One particularly common problem with Windows 8 and later is in the Windows \"Fast Startup\" feature, which turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations. The result is that filesystems appear damaged to Ubuntu. The solution is to disable Fast Startup, as described here (among many other places). Note that the Windows Fast Startup feature is entirely separate from a firmware feature that often has a similar name.\n\n\nIf I had to lay a bet, I'd say that Fast Startup is your problem.\nAll that said, gdisk enables losslessly converting MBR to GPT or vice-versa, albeit with some caveats. See this gdisk documentation page for details. (Note: I'm the author of gdisk.) I mention this only in the interests of providing a direct answer to your question. I do NOT recommend doing this conversion, at least not unless and until you've better diagnosed your problem.\n\nEDIT:\nFirst, your GParted screen shot shows one normal partition (/dev/sda1) and another thing that is marked \"не размечено.\" That translates as \"not marked out,\" according to Google translate; but I suspect it's unallocated space (it would be marked as \"unallocated\" when run on a system that uses English). If I'm right in my interpretation, that's not a partition at all; it's just empty space. This is perfectly normal, although 129 MiB of free space is a bit much. Perhaps there was a partition there once but it was deleted.\nSecond, there's a little alert flag next to your /dev/sda1 in the GParted screen shot. These icons vary so much from one release to another that I can't be sure, but I suspect this icon exists to indicate filesystem damage. This is consistent with my hypothesis that your problem is caused by Fast Startup, which makes the filesystem look damaged in Ubuntu. I'm afraid I didn't quite understand what you were saying about Fast Startup in your second reply; we're hitting language barrier issues. All I can do is to reiterate that Fast Startup can and does cause problems, and you MUST disable it on Windows 8 and later if you expect to share filesystems between Windows and Linux. With Fast Startup enabled, you can select \"shutdown\" in Windows all you want and the system will not shut down in the conventional sense; it will go into a sleep mode in which the filesystem is in an inconsistent safe, and is therefore unsafe or impossible to use from any other OS.\nThird, the sgdisk output you posted indicates that the secondary partition table overlaps the one and only partition on the disk. This is often caused by software (\"fake\") RAID issues. This can happen even on single-disk systems or on disks that have previously been used in RAID setups but that are now used by themselves, because of leftover RAID data. It could also be that the disk was copied from one that was slightly larger than the current one; depending on the copy method, the result could be a problem like what you're seeing. The output of sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda might help clarify what's going on.\nI strongly recommend against doing anything that writes changes to the partition table at this point, because it's not clear what the problem is. Making permanent changes in ignorance runs a serious risk of making matters worse, so it's best to proceed with caution until you understand the cause of the problem.\n", "Q: g++4.9 -fvtable-verify link error: cannot find vtv_start.o I am running g++ 4.9.2.0ubuntu1~14.04 (installed from the toolchain ppa: ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test), and I want to use the Virtual Table Verification (VTV) feature (-fvtable-verify in C++ dialect options).

Is it because there are too many kernels to remove? \nI was thinking to leave it running the grub configurator, but it would take days and I'm really afraid to melt my drive due to intense hdd activity during the process.\n\nA: Practically speaking, if you are about to uninstall a number of old kernels (or perhaps you are part-way through that process) and you want to speed things up, you could try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file /usr/sbin/update-grub as root, and add the line exit 0 after the line #!/bin/sh.\n\n*Use apt-get or Software Center to remove your unwanted kernels as planned.\n\n*Afterwards, remove that line from /usr/sbin/update-grub.\n\n*Important!  Finally, run update-grub manually.\n\nIt would be great if in future dpkg would work out to perform this behaviour automatically.\nOne notable exception is when you are uninstalling the kernel which is currently the default in grub.  In that case it might be preferable to run update-grub sooner rather than later.\n\nA: Every time you install/remove a kernel, the install-hook grub-configures every installed kernel. This is safer and less error-prone, and generally not too much slower to matter.\nOffhand, I'd guess there was something wrong with that drive. Look into this.\nIf running the grub-reconfiguration and stuff is what's taking all the time, it may be possible to disable this, and only run it for the last of the kernel packages or something. Look into apt.conf(5), DPkg:: options to apt, and related stuff.\n\nA: I solved the slowness. I unplugged one of secondary hard drives and it worked. \nFrom what I researched, it looks like this kind of problem is related with some fault partition/drive.\nEDIT:\nThe unplugged drive was dying. I needed to buy a replacement.\n", "Q: Convert png to pdf without using convert I'm trying to convert, from the command line,  .png files of screenshots created by scrot to pdf files.

For some reason, the command \nconvert file.png file.pdf\n\ndoes a conversion, but it's not a literal one (and wont print properly)\nFor comparison purposes, I've posted on the web the output from convert\nhttps://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE211/currentYear/convert.pdf\nand the output from shotwell.\nhttps://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE211/currentYear/shotwell.pdf\nAs you can see, the file convert.pdf is much much lower resolution, larger font, and most importantly, doesn't print properly using the standard lpr command.\nAre the any off-the-shelf, easily installable, png to pdf conversion programs  that would do a better job than convert?     Or alternatively are there options to convert that I could use that would result in an exact conversion?     There are a billion flags for convert, but I really don't know where to start.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: I use the Phatch. You will have to create the actionlist with the graphical user interface (gui), and later invoke it from the command line.\nInstall:\nsudo apt-get install phatch\n\nPhatch is not only about converting from one format to another, but you can also batch crop, rotate, etc.\nAfter install select the program from the dash or type \nphatch \ninto the command line. Now the gui will open. Click on the green cross and search for the \"Save\" command to add it to the actionlist. Define type as \"pdf\" and an output folder (and other parameters if you want to). Default output folder is ~/desktop/phatch. If the program can't find the indicated folder during the convert action, it will create it automatically. \nNow press Ctrl+Shift+S and save the actionlist giving it a name like \"convert2pdf\". Default path where actionlists are stored is ~/.local/share/phatch/actionlists. I recommend to choose your home folder for now. Now you have defined an actionlist which converts to pdf.\nYou have to do this previous step only once. From now on you can invoke the actionlist every time you need from the terminal in the following way:\nphatch convert2pdf.phatch ~/folder/to/convert\n\nEverything inside the ~/folder/to/convert will be converted to pdf and put into the output folder on your desktop. The original files won't be deleted.\n", "Q: arecord does not work with crontab I am having a problem with cron job recordings.

The arecord will write 44 bytes of the output .wav file and the stop forever. I have to use kill -9 to stop the process.\nAny ideas what is going on?\n\nA: There is an environmental variable called XDG_RUNTIME_DIR that needs to be setup before you invoke the arecord command. I set mine to \"setenv XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /run/user/${euid}\". Also, arecord uses \"pulseaudio\" to interface the hardware.

Pdf is like a digital print, so you can't format text any more as in an editor. That's what pdf was developed for.\nWhat you can do with simple pdf's, mostly text with few images and tables, is to copy everything to a text editor (e.g. writer) and delete backspaces with 'search and replace', using regular expressions.

Since this is a TFT display and I can't find any indication to the contrary I'm using a refresh rate of 60 to generate the modeline.\nSo you'd generate the modeline with:\ncvt 1920 1080 60\nWhich results in output similar to this:\n1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz\nModeline \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen you would apply the modeline with xrandr with:\nxrandr --newmode Everything After Modeline from the cvt output\nincluding the quotes and then \nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080_60.00 \nWhere VGA1 is the port your display is connected to and the remainder of the line is everything between quotes from the cvt output\nSources:\nhttps://www.manualslib.com/manual/673627/Iiyama-Prolite-E2407hds.html#manual\nhttp://www.kmart.com/asus-n56j-15.6inch-notebook-with-intel-core-i7/p-020V007360940000P\nhttp://www.manualmonitor.com/manuals/iiyama/Iiyama_ProLite_E2407HDS-1.pdf\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaResolutionXorgConf\nHow to set a custom resolution?\n\nA: For me the solution was as simple as opening Driver Manager from the start menu and then picking a different driver and rebooting!\n\nBoth nvidia-460 and nvidia-495 produced the CRTC error message for me while nvidia-470 and nouveau worked just fine (although the nvidia is considered better).

I am just wondering if I can run both windows and Ubuntu DHCP/DNS Server in the same LAN. The Present configuration is Windows 2003 Server AD and Ubuntu DHCP n DNS Server with BINDS.  I have proposed to upgrade AD to 2008R2 and wanted to have fail over and was wondering \"What IF\" Scenario for DCHP and DNS.....\nAny thoughts and insights are much appreciated\nThanks\n\nA: I will give you some thoughts and some links for further reading. Take them with several grains of salt.\nDHCP\nIt is possible to run multiple DHCP servers on the same LAN. However they must not serve the same address pool. Reason is that DHCP is first-come-first-serve. If both machines hand out the same pool, there is a good chance to assign IPs twice. \nThe easiest way is to split the scope. Say, one server hands out addresses 192.168.0.1-129 and the other 192.168.0.130-254. This way no inconsistencies can arise. This is sort of the \"cheap\" failover way.\nThe proper failover method would be, if the servers are aware of each other, so that in the event that one becomes unavailable, the other jumps in. For that to work however, they both need to share a lease-file; the failover partner needs to be aware of which IPs the other one handed out before failure. As far as I know this was introduced as late as Windows Server 2012. The common ISC DHCP server supports this readily; I have seen this in action.\nUnfortunately I don't think there is a way to achieve this sort of failover in a heterogeneous environment.\nDNS\nIn principle it is no problem running multiple DNS servers. DNS intrinsically supports replication by assigning master/slave roles.\nHowever with ActiveDirectory things become more complex, as AD relies on DDNS updates from the DHCP. I have now read quite some opinions about this topic ranging from \"Not a problem\" to \"huge clusterfuck\". See the links below.\nIt seems to be no problem to substitute BIND9 for Windows DNS in an AD environment. It also seems to be fine, to run BIND as a secondary along the primary Windows DNS. What I'm really skeptical about is, if they both serve DHCP too. I imagine DDNS will not work flawlessly, though dynamic updates of Windows DNS from ISC DHCP seem possible.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*This excellent post on Serverfault about multiple DHCP.\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/561449/how-can-i-use-a-linux-bind-dns-server-for-my-active-directory-forest\n\n*https://serverfault.com/questions/6273/how-can-i-get-bind-and-microsoft-dns-to-work-together-well\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2110181\n\n*http://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/linux/network-services/using-linux-bind-dns-servers-for-active-directory-domains/\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/247560/linux-dns-for-windows-domain\n\n*https://arstechnica.co.uk/civis/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=1135491\n\n*https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/active-directory-cookbook/0596004648/ch18s12.html\n\nA: dns is not problem because is ip address witch is different. Is not good to run two dhcp server. You will not known witch server will response to dhcp request from client. Also you must prevent same ip address on one lan, but you can prevent this by spliting one net range.\nFor example\nwin server\n\nnet range: xxx.xxx.xxx.1 - xxx.xxx.xxx.128\nmask: 255.255.255.0\ngateway: xxx.xxx.xxx.254\ndns: xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy\n\nubuntu server\n\nnet range: xxx.xxx.xxx.129 - xxx.xxx.xxx.253\nmask: 255.255.255.0\ngateway: xxx.xxx.xxx.254\ndns: xxx.xxx.xxx.zzz\n\nThis will avoid duplicated ip addresses.\nSecond solution is better but you must have switch-es. Create two vlan, split lan to two net ranges and put one dhcp server per vlan.\n", "Q: gedit - cannot open display I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and for installing Hadoop I created hadoop user as hduser.

My problem is that I am sometimes getting the compilation error\n    stray '\\240' in program\n    stray '\\302' in program\n\nwhich happens after I accidentally pressed SHIFT+Space (instead of Space only).

But it's kinda inconvenient for file list, because it's all hardcoded. I'd rather fill my files in some sort of array, then let user pick a number which again maps to array offset.\n\nBasically this is what I imagine:\nFollowing `*.war` archives were found, select one:\n\n  1) old.war\n  2) debug.war\n  3) release.war\n\nUse number to select a file or 'stop' to cancel: blah\n'blah' is not a number\nUse number to select a file or 'stop' to cancel: 2\ndebug.war installed\n\nBut how do I turn list of files into this array thingy:\noptions=(\"Option 1\" \"Option 2\" \"Option 3\" \"Quit\")\n\nHow do I get string at certain offset in options? How do I ensure user is asked to try again? Can I allow for string stop to stop selection mode?\n\nA: You could also use a shell glob to get the list of files. This approach has the advantage of not using an external program (find) and of not needing any restriction on the type of file (*war, for example) given:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## Collect the files in the array $files\nfiles=( ~/foo/war/* )\n## Enable extended globbing.

These can be given directly (select color in red green blue) or come from the expansion of a file glob (select file in *.war), as well as expanding an array into words as the example you found does (select option in \"${options[@]}\").\n\nHow do I get string at certain offset in options? \n\nselect does this automatically, and stores it into the variable you provide. (If the user's input is invalid, it stores the empty string.)\n\nHow do I ensure user is asked to try again? \n\nAgain select does this for you, because select makes a loop, like while. It will keep asking until you break out of the loop (or until it reads EOF, usually entered by Ctrl+D).\n\nCan I allow for string stop to stop selection mode?\n\nYes, the user's input is put in the variable REPLY, regardless of whether it corresponds to one of the options, so you can check for specific values and handle them differently.\nPutting it all together:\necho \"The following `*.war` archives were found; select one:\"\n\n# set the prompt used by select, replacing \"#?\"\nPS3=\"Use number to select a file or 'stop' to cancel: \"\n\n# allow the user to choose a file\nselect filename in *.war\ndo\n    # leave the loop if the user says 'stop'\n    if [[ \"$REPLY\" == stop ]]; then break; fi\n\n    # complain if no file was selected, and loop to ask again\n    if [[ \"$filename\" == \"\" ]]\n    then\n        echo \"'$REPLY' is not a valid number\"\n        continue\n    fi\n\n    # now we can use the selected file\n    echo \"$filename installed\"\n\n    # it'll ask for another unless we leave the loop\n    break\ndone\n\n\nA: To save the outputs of find in a bash array use this:\nunset options i\nwhile IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' f; do\n  options[i++]=\"$f\"\ndone < <(find /dir/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \"*.war\" -print0 )\n\n\n\n*\n\n*read reads the input from find null delimited (-d $'\\0').\n\n\n*\n\n*The array $options is filled with the filenames.\n\n\n*find searches only for files (-type f) within the given directory (-maxdepth 1) with ending .war (-name \"*.war\") and prints them delimted by the null character (-print0).\n\n\n\nThe select menu can be done like this:\nselect opt in \"${options[@]}\" \"Stop the script\"; do\n  case $opt in\n    *.war)\n      echo \"War file $opt selected\"\n      # processing\n      ;;\n    \"Stop the script\")\n      echo \"You chose to stop\"\n      break\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo \"This is not a number\"\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\nIt works as follows:\n1) /dir/old.war\n2) /dir/debug.war\n3) /dir/release.war\n4) Stop the script\n#? test\nThis is not a number\n#? 2\nWar file /dir/debug.war selected\n#? 4\nYou chose to stop\n\n", "Q: Setup to try OpenStack on a single machine I have been assigned to install openstack on a single machine in our dev office.\nI am following the guide here : http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_basic_environment.html \nMy goal is to install 3 nodes : a controller, a compute and a network (as described in the guide).\nWhat I do not understand, is how I should set up my environment to try to install my nodes.  \nNote : host and VMs are all ubuntus, and I use Oracle's virtualbox.\nI am currently installing 3 VMs on 1 VM, to simulate 3 servers, but I feel like it's not the good solution (let the compute power problem aside for now).\nThat's something the doc isn't clear about : should I install everything in one single VM ? Am I on the good road ?  \nAny advice on how to proceed with my environment (1 VM? Multiple VMs ? Multiple VMs in 1 VM to isolate from the host system ? No VMs ?) would be much appreciated as I feel a bit lost in the docs, and I have only 4 months of experience (and I'm a dev, not a sysadmin :s)\nMany thanks for considering my request.\n\nA: Considering that you are using Oracle Virtual box and that Openstack guide recommends 64 bit install, pretty much narrows your choices.\nLets see 1 by 1 :\n\n\n*\n\n*No VM : I am not sure here how would you achieve installation of 3\ndifferent nodes since you only have 1 physical server. Also it does\nnot seem to be reccommended setup.  \n\n*Single VM : Same issue as above.\n\n*Multiple VMS inside 1 VM: Would be a neat solution, but oracle\nvirtual box has limitation with this and you would restricted to 32 bit installation should you choose nested visualization. Refer to the this ticket here.\nI got lot of info from this thread .\nSo I guess that leaves 1 choice - Install multiple VMs on your host server. I had to simulate multiple network elements and my host machine was a laptop. I got away by using DSL VMs. Now DSL definitely would not be option for running open stack but you may be you want to use Lubuntu if you are short on juice on your host server.   \n\nA: Most hypervisors need hardware virtualisation, that seems to be unavailable in a VirtualBox VM (if you create another VM inside the first), so nesting VMs with virtualbox is, in that case, a bad idea because, you won't have a 64-bit system to install openstack, that is strongly recommanded.  \nA solution in that case is to install 3 VMs on the guest system, and then find a workaround to simulate the network.\n\nA: On ubuntu you have several choices.   And none of these require virtualbox.\nThe Ubuntu Single-Installer installs all of Openstack into LXC containers on your PC.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/lts/clouddocs/installer/en/single-install.html\nThen there is the just released Rackspace Openstack-Ansible (OSA) which kind of does the same thing.. re deploys ALL of Openstack into LXC containers on your PC.\nhttps://developer.rackspace.com/blog/life-without-devstack-openstack-development-with-osa/\nI've installed both although OSA is newer and other than the Install which went flawlessly... I haven't had much of a chance to play with it yet.\nFYI... from my understanding Canonical is working hard to have their installation of Openstack for Ubuntu 16.04 to be able to install and run all payloads in only LXC containers... which will be very cool from my perspective, particularly because Canonical is integrating all of that into JUJU which will make overall orchestration of Openstack much more interesting.\nAlso, this video from the recent Tokyo Openstack conference is very good and giving an overview of the various popular methods of installing Openstack.   As the video shows... what Canonical is doing with Juju & Openstack is really quite a bit ahead of other methods in regards to deploying/upgrading \"services\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM1ANSge01g\n\nA: Another great tutorial I used is found at the following link\nOpenstack with Autopilot\n\nA: Openstack Fuel can be used to do a virtualized openstack install all on one machine. The host needs to be beefy, ssd and at least 64GB ram, 96GB better. Using virt-manger, create one vm for Fuel. Install Fuel in to the VM. two more vm, one for controller, and one for compute. These two hosts will need to be configured to DHCP boot from the fuel server. Use the Fuel web interface to configure an Fuel Environment. That's the Fuel way having multiple groups of hosts run an instance of openstack. There is a detailed description on how to setup linux bridges. The referenced configuration will allow Fuel to run with all of Fuel's default opinions. Very much a convention over configuration run. It's a great way for someone who knows nothing about Openstack to get up and running.\nhttp://www.jeffreygong.com/2016/07/deploying-openstack-with-fuel-on-kvm.html\nThere are shell scripts that will do an All in One install of Fuel on Virtual box. Your going to need to fill out the contact form and agree to the terms of service at the mirantis.com web site to get them. These scripts are very automated. If you go that route, run the launch.sh script as root. Not running the script as root costed me a few days. The install will take a few hours. The result will have the virtual box networking correctly configured, fuel on a VM, and VM for nodes for openstack servers ready. Launching a VM in this openstack install will result in Virtual box running the nested VM as emulated. It can be really slow. like many minutes to hours to start an instance of a VM. This was a dell r710 with 24 gigs of ram. Raising the ram 48 Gig and eventually 96 Gigs of ram boosted performance. It's my opinion that the results of an Virtual Box install of Openstack is not the best option. \nIf you want to have an All in One Openstack install that is useful, the use Fuel on KVM is a viable option.\nThe blog post above is the directions to achieve the same results as the Mirantis Virtual Box launch.sh scripts. Because it's KVM, nested VM are not emulated.\n", "Q: uninstall wireshark Version 1.12.7 from ubuntu trusty tar I installed this version {version 1.12.7} of Wireshark and its not working as i want it.

Can I erase all partitions on my computer, including EFI, and install only Ubuntu? Will the BIOS work in this case? \nI'm currently in legacy mode and Ubuntu boots from an USB key.\n\nA: Yes, when you completely erase the disk, you can install ubuntu as the single operating system.\nWhen you can disable UEFI in BIOS (mostly you can) you even can install ubuntu in mbr mode.\nBoot from ubuntu install media, open GParted and create a new partition table - choose mbr.\nIn case you can not disable UEFI and/or secure boot you as well can install ubuntu in EFI mode.\nThen the installer will create a new EFI partition where the GRUB boot loader will be installed.\n\nA: You question is not completely clear to me.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode here is what you need to do :\nYou will need to set your BIOS in UEFI mode and to create an UEFI bootable Ubuntu USB key.\nFollow this guide to create a UEFI bootable USB. Then simply run the Ubuntu installer ; at step Installation Type, select Something Else and partition your disk as explained in this answer.\n\nIf boot mode (UEFI or Legacy) does not matter for you simply install Ubuntu as usual. (Refer to this guide if needed)\n\nA: The question uses some terminology incorrectly, which can lead to confusion and problems down the road, so I want to address these issues first.\nThe Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), or its 2.x version, the Unified EFI (UEFI), is a type of firmware. The EFI is not a partition. That said, there is a partition called the EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds boot loaders. Chances are that lapisdecor meant \"ESP\" rather than \"EFI\" in the original question.\nAlso, the EFI is a type of firmware that replaces the older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). As such, if your computer uses an EFI, it does not have a BIOS. There are, however, some caveats and exceptions. Most commonly, EFIs provide a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is a sort of BIOS emulator; the CSM is to EFI like what dosemu is to Linux, in that it enables a newer and more sophisticated environment (EFI or Linux) to run programs designed for an older and simpler system (BIOS or DOS). In other words, \"BIOS\" in the original question should be \"EFI.\" That said, using \"BIOS\" in place of \"EFI\" is a common practice. It's a bad one, but it's common, both among users and among manufacturers. I suspect it's done because people know (more or less) what a BIOS is, whereas \"EFI\" is an unfamiliar acronym; and since EFI replaces BIOS, using \"BIOS\" makes the job easier for copywriters. The trouble is that people then drag all their BIOS knowledge up when they read \"BIOS,\" but much of it is inapplicable. EFI boots in a very different way from BIOS, so if you think of EFI as being an enhanced BIOS, you'll have a mental model that's very wrong and you'll make mistakes. Then people like me end up spending a lot of time explaining how it all actually works -- but I digress....\nMoving on to real issues: If you're \"in legacy mode,\" that just means that your CSM is active. This does not guarantee a boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, though. On most EFI-based computers, when the CSM is disabled, the boot path is relatively simple; you can boot only EFI-mode boot loaders. Note that you can't \"disable the EFI\"; the EFI is the firmware, and it's in charge of the computer. Some computers do enable you to disable the ability to boot in EFI mode, but such options are rare -- and some computers provide interfaces that make it sound as if you're disabling EFI-mode booting, but you really aren't. When you activate the CSM, most computers enable either type of boot loader to run, which makes it impossible to predict what will happen when you feed the computer a disk that provides both types of boot loader. This isn't normally a big deal for a single-boot computer; when you install the OS, the installer will detect its boot mode and install the boot loader only for the installer's boot mode, so the computer can boot from the hard disk only in that same mode. If you multi-boot, though, you can easily install one OS in one boot mode and the other OS in the other boot mode. The hair-pulling begins at this point.\nIn the not-too-distant past, EFI-mode booting was an exercise in frustration because of bugs in EFIs, bugs in boot loaders, and misinformation, which often made enabling the CSM appealing. Today, though, EFI-mode booting poses fewer problems, and my estimate from questions posted here and elsewhere is that the biggest single problem area today is from activated CSMs. Thus, I recommend that the CSM (aka \"legacy boot\") be disabled on EFI-based computers unless you have a good reason to enable it. To be sure, EFI-mode booting today poses more challenges than BIOS-mode booting did five years ago; but on an EFI-based computer, BIOS-mode booting creates pitfalls that didn't exist five years ago.\nSo, that long-winded stuff out of the way, let's get back to your original question, re-phrased slightly:\n\nCan I erase all partitions on my computer, including ESP, and install only Ubuntu? Will the EFI work in this case?\n\nYes and yes.\nAfter you erase your partitions, the Ubuntu installer will create new ones if you select an automatic partitioning option. If you partition manually, you'll need to create appropriate partitions. These may include an ESP if you install in EFI mode or a BIOS Boot Partition if you install to a GPT disk in BIOS mode.\nOne important caveat is that it's best to use GPT when installing in EFI mode and MBR when installing in BIOS mode. Ubuntu permits using GPT in BIOS mode, but this can create problems on some systems, so I recommend avoiding it if possible. Some people have managed to install to MBR disks in EFI mode, too, but the installer tries to avoid this if possible; and when it's done, it often creates problems.\nIn Ubuntu, you can determine your boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode.\nIn sum, you should be aware of your boot mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy or EFI/UEFI) and your partition table type (MBR or GPT), and ideally you should match the two appropriately (BIOS/MBR or EFI/GPT).\n\nA: I have EUFI boot on my machine. 1x256GB SSD running 18.04 Clean \"erase disks\" option used during install.\nHere is my output from lsblk\nsda                     8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk \n├─sda1                  8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/efi\n└─sda2                  8:2    0   238G  0 part \n  ├─ubuntu--vg-root   253:0    0   237G  0 lvm  /\n  └─ubuntu--vg-swap_1 253:1    0   976M  0 lvm  [SWAP]\n\nIs this ideal?  I am running 18.04 exclusively on my PC.\nsort of like the above question. I assume the 512M sda1 here is needed?\nAs opposed to installing somehow so that all i have is 1 sda1 partition using the whole disk?  you can see I chose LVM on install as well so i can play more after install.\nIf there is a way to have only 1 partition would my boot be faster?\nor would I brick my PC or be unbootable without this EUFI partition?\nRyan\n\nA: WARNING: This will erase data.\n\nI had to recreate the partition table. Create a new GPT partition table in GParted (MSDOS will not work).\nThis will flag the sector as damaged and it will not be used.\n", "Q: How can I invoke \"scsi start stop\" from command-line since gnome-disks seems to support this call? I'm on Ubuntu 14.04LTS. Gnome-disk-utility has a button which invokes the scsi start stop unit command on a selected device. I'd like to invoke scsi stop for a device (in my case an empty SD-card adapter for micro-SD which I always leave in its slot) in a script/one line command so my system stops probing the empty adapter.\nGnome-disks depends on udisks and other modules for its functions. \nI'm trying to find which package is responsible for scsi calls and how I can invoke this outside of gnome-disks-gui (preferably without installing other packages).\nAny ideas anyone?\n\nA: You can use sg_start, which can be found in the sg3utils package:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sg3utils\n\n\nA: I looked further and found the answer to my own question.\nWhen looking at my syslog i noticed that the module responsible for the command was udisksd which has a control utility udisksctl supporting the command power-off [options]. Since the action to be taken on power-off differs for different devices (sd*, hd* etc.) it parses the necessary commands automagicly sourcing the right library which for SCSI would be libsgutils2-2 i assume. So installing other packages is not necessary for just this function. Since you can not rely on /dev/sd* to always pick the right device use something like /dev/disk/by-id/\nMy command-line became: $ udisksctl power-off --block-device /dev/disk/by-id/usb-Generic-_Multi-Card_20090516388200000-0\\:0\nWhen reinserting the adapter it gets detected and started automaticly\n", "Q: How can I undo the effects of startx logverbose 6 Since running sudo startx logverbose 6 I can no longer log in to Ubuntu 14.04.

Each icon is not an executable; it is a .desktop file. bamfdaemon helps this by determining whether an arrow needs to be added to an existing icon, or a new icon be popped up, along with other behaviors dependent on application identity.\n\nAnd also, it does many other helping tasks in regards to help GUI to provide nice user experience. So killing this will not work, as first of all it is a daemon process, by nature it will be re-spawned by system. Also it can cause severe issue with your GUI as it could mess that up!\nSolution to this is not simple as re-installation or removal of component.\nI suggest two methods here...\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase Unity Performance or DuckDuckGo.\n\n*Change Desktop Interface OR Try any of these Linux Desktop Environments\nNOTE: Before you try any of above link...\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have lesser amount RAM, (I'm not sure how much amount of RAM sufficient to run Unity smoothly!), then better go for second option, choose any light-weight desktop interface.\n\n*If less RAM is not the case and system has graphics card, then I guess changing driver in Xorg configuration can do some improvement in performance.

Go ahead and get a video card when you need it and just make a new question if you have trouble getting it working.\n\nA: The answer is yes, it works.

In that latter regard, it is utterly disappointing.\nMaybe one day upgrading from 14.04 to a newer release, or newer Nvidia drivers would make it possible, but for now there's a myriad of layers of software and software settings involved, which provide little to no proper and relevant diagnostic information.\nIt might be the case that with Nvidia cards lacking SLI support this cannot work, but the current state of documentation leaves that at the state of a conjecture.\n", "Q: Sort and classify files using their name components (unix) I have a folder with thousands of files respecting the following naming scheme:\n\n'institute_model_scenario_river.txt'\n\nEach components of the files names (institute, model, scenario, river) are variables.\nThen, I would like to sort and classify those files by the name of each variables exept 'scenario' and 'river'. \nTherefore, each institute name should be used to create a corresponding directory.

The connection is local via USB.\nAt the point of first usage, the system did recognize the device somehow so that I could print, but I cannot scan documents yet. Full scanning functionalities are the aim.\nFrom https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HpAllInOne I learn that\n\nYou have selected Ubuntu 14.04 using the HP Color LaserJet MFP m277dw. Ubuntu 14.04 supplies HPLIP 3.11.5 by default, which does not support your printer. You must ensure latest HPLIP version (recommemded), or at least HPLIP 3.15.4 in order to use your printer with Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nChecking on http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=HPLIP&searchon=names&suite=trusty&section=all shows that, to date, Ubuntu 14.04 covers up to HPLIP 3.14.3 only.\nThe question is: what is the fail-safe strategy (i.e. the sequence of commands) that I should follow to get this all-in-one printer to scan?\nI have run hp-check -r whose output is here.\nThanks for dealing with this.\n\nA: My research is shared in the comments below the question post. In essence I came across two barriers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nominally, the minimum HPLIP version needed for this new printer model is not supported by the Ubuntu standard toolkit. This is not a hard limitation though. I could install the latest HPLIP version 3.16.11 (so this answer has been updated, dated Feb 2017) while holding on to Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/gethplip.html to download the installer hplip-3.16.1.run in a convenient directory. This is a bash script and you may need to make it executable (say chmod 774 hplip-3.16.1.run). It starts a interactive build of hplip.\n\n*The interactive dialogues launched by the script are described pretty well in http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install/install/index.html. It recognizes missing dependencies and installs them --- in my situation this caused no critical situation such disruptive or avalanching dependencies requests. It also took care patiently of removing the extant version 3.14.3.\n\n*Then, the script gave the option to run the tools hp-setup and hp-plugin. They took care of identifying the printer model, install the relevant PPD file (driver) and customize some settings such as the device names for printer and fax.\n\n*In the end I have printed out the test page successfully. The scanner is active (type 'scan' in the Launcher). I have not tested the fax.\n\n*As a last step, at the point of printing a document from an application (say, gedit), there was a claim that the printer was not connected whereas it was. To fix this, I went to the CUSP interface page http://localhost:631/admin and added the printer manually following the instructions displayed there. Hence the printer showed up in the tab http://localhost:631/printers. At this point, the printing queue moved on, much to my relief.\n\n\n*The earlier upgrade process to HPLIP 3.15.4 in another computer was not fail-safe. A missing library python-dev interrupted the installation of the latest version, but the script did not fall back onto the earlier version that had been wiped out in the meantime. Nowadays the installation script for 3.16.11 takes care of dependency and conflict issues. However, for one computer out of four (all Ubuntu's 14.04), the bulk of HPLIP got installed while some important utilities, such as hp-setup and hp-plugin, failed.

However, software that is installed may be a library, which are stored in /lib. \nThus, really, there is no single folder where all of the applications are installed.\n", "Q: BIOS won't see neither USB nor HDD after install I recently installed a new hard drive on a Dell Inspiron 14z laptop\nI installed Ubuntu over Wifi through a mini live boot from a USB key\nAbsolutely no errors during these processes occured.\nSince then though, the BIOS won't boot neither on the usb-key, nor the hard-drive, where the Ubuntu was installed.

This summer evolution has started, for no apparent reason, to ask for mail account passwords and key-ring passwords at 5 minute intervals. Can Anyone tell me how to cure this \"illness\" and how can the \"key-ring\" be disabled altogether. I have always been warned NOT to use key-ring utilities as they are prime hacker targets. (Using Kubuntu 14.04 and Netrunner 14).\n\nA: You cannot disable the keyring. Evolution requires gnome-keyring, as that is where it stores the password secrets for your accounts. Whomever warned you to not use keyring utilities is very misguided. There's a difference between the local keyring on your device, and a cloud based keyring service. The latter can be risky because there is no clear answer as to how a proprietary service is protecting your data.\nTo stop it asking for your password all the time, go to the Account settings for your account, switch to the Receiving Options, and ensure that the option to Check for new messages every XX minutes is disabled. You may also want to disable the Use Quick Resync if the server supports it and Listen for server change notifications options.\n", "Q: Make the Unity top panel look like the one on the lock screen/greeter I like the way top bar looks on the lock screen (Ubuntu 15.04).

Ubuntu installed quite easily on my Windows 10 laptop despite the secure boot stuff. Evidently Microsoft signs Ubuntu loaders so that it is acceptable for their secure boot system. Whatever. It works. \nNow I have a different problem. Firstly, I have to hit F12 at boot to see the Microsoft boot loader. Otherwise it just loads into Windows. That is not a big deal really. But it would be nice to just show the loader automatically. Not sure if anything can be done about that. \nBut what COULD be done is switching the order of the OS's displayed in the Microsoft loader. It loads Windows by default, so if it is not displayed (by hitting F12) it just loads windows. But if I select Ubuntu, it THEN loads the Grub2 loader, which has the selection on it for Ubuntu or Windows (with Ubuntu as the default). Seems to me that if I just set the Microsoft loader to load Ubuntu by default, I would not have to hit F12 or even SEE that loader as it would just show Grub2. \nFor clarity, here is my boot sequences:\nNot pressing anything extra:\npress power.\nloads Windows 10. (never shows grub2 or the windows loader)\nDual boot by Pressing F12:\npress power.\nDisplays Microsoft boot loader, showing Windows 10 as default and Ubuntu.\nSelect Ubuntu\nDisplays the Grub2 boot loader, showing Ubuntu as default.\nSelect nothing, loads Ubuntu\nWhat I propose is making Ubuntu the default in the WINDOWS boot loader, so that my new sequence would be:\nPress power:\n(Windows loader as default selects Ubuntu, and then loads Grub 2 by default without pressing anything)\nGrub2 displays, \nI select Windows or it just loads into Ubuntu by default.\nWhen I installed Ubuntu I just let it do things automatically. I installed it to a USB, which booted fine, ran it from USB to test it, all devices on the laptop worked, so I installed it from inside Ubuntu. I selected the automatic setup for dual boot and did not make partitions myself (other than selecting the size for Ubuntu by moving that divider bar). \nHope that is enough info. The Windows 10 version is the upgrade from Windows 8. I tried installing other versions of Linux that don't have the Microsoft approved-to-load signature and they failed every time to even get to a desktop from USB live. But of course, Ubuntu is \"signed\" by Microsoft to have the boot key necessary to work. The version of Ubuntu is the latest version as of this post, downloaded today. Version 14.04.3 directly from the Ubuntu website. \n\nA: You may find solace in this link from Microsoft Answers. I take no credit for this answer: \nI suggest you to boot the computer to WinRE from the elevated command prompt, and try running this command and check for the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Windows 10 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE).\n\n*In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.\n\n*Click Repair your computer.\n\n*Click the 10 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.\n\n*Click Command Prompt.\n\n*At the command prompt, type the following commands, and then press ENTER:\n\n\n\ncd /d Partition:\\Windows\\System32\nbcdedit /timeout 5\nYou may also change the timeout value to anything below 30.\nNow you may restart your computer and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.\nRefer:\nChange the default operating system for startup (multiboot)\n\nA: Well, I fixed the issue rather easily. \nBooting, pressed F2 to get into Bios. This used to be impossible in win 8 but for some reason in win 10 this is easy. \nUnder the BOOT tab, I simply selected \"UbuntuWDC WD10JPVX-22JC310\" and move it to position 3, above \"Windows Boot Manager\"\nNow the boot sequence bypasses the Windows Boot Manager completely and goes straight to the Grub2. Selecting Windows from Grub2 does start a rather long boot for Windows, but I don't care as I hardly ever use Windows 10. Selecting Ubuntu loads Ubuntu pretty quick. \nRegarding the solution above, I did shorten the boot delay of the Windows loader but did not have to use dos instructions to do so. I just went into the advanced system startup settings and found it in the boot/recovery section. That was easy.\n\n", "Q: How can I make more than 4 partitions in a hard disk?

Pls advise.\n\n\nA: You probably are using software RAID, right?  If so, you need to either purchase a hardware RAID card, or sacrifice your RAID setup for Ubuntu.\nYou can buy hardware RAID controllers for as little as $20, and they also improve RAID performance.  Alternatively you can trash the RAID to install Ubuntu, or a 3rd option: add another HDD in there and install to that.\n\nA: [SOLVED]\nIt is hardware raid, and the solution was very simple after all.

My banks require that I use it. Any help would be appreciated. I've only found very old answers online.\n\nA: This is 100% honest and being 100% straightforward. It is possible, and impossible at the same time. One way you could try is by using Wine to make an instance of Windows, that can use Internet Explorer. Other ways are out-dated. Here's how to get Wine and get Internet Explorer running.\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThis may take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes depending on your internet speeds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open winetricks                                            \n\n*Set Windows Version to 8                                     \n\n*Go from Winetricks to Install a windows program                            \n\n*Scroll down until you find Internet Explorer and install it                        \n\n*You will then be able to see Internet Explorer in your launcher.                            \n\n\nA: Internet Explorer is just too dependent on a Windows environment to work well with Ubuntu. Even if you somehow manage to install it, you're likely to have a very poor experience: it will crash and do unexpected things constantly. If you call your bank for support, they'll blame it on your environment (and if you tell them you're using Ubuntu they'll just say it's not supported and stop helping you).\nOptions to install Internet Explorer include Wine (but see this report which shows that the experience is \"garbage\"), playonlinux (again, the reports show a very poor experience) or this thing called ies4linux (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingInternetExplorer), which installs very old versions of IE which are also likely to be rejected by your bank.\nYou're likely to have better luck if you install VirtualBox, create a virtual machine, and install Windows with native IE there. I assume you already have a copy of Windows to install.\n", "Q: Cursor Unwanted Behaviour I am running Ubuntu 14.04 on an Acer laptop. The cursor often unwantedly\n\n\n*\n\n*moves and jumps to different locations,\n\n*drags and drops items, or\n\n*randomly clicks on things.\n\n\nCould anyone suggest a solution for this?\nI don't know if this is caused by a bug in the drivers or the operating system, or it is caused by some malware.\nAdditional Note: I am using the touchpad of my laptop for controlling the cursor and it is for about a few months that the problem has appeared. Before that, I used to run different versions of Ubuntu with no such problem.\n\nA: I have the same problem. The reason:\nI have a very old laptop and when my battery and laptop charger broke, I purchased \"generic\" ones on ebay and not the original from Lenovo. The battery does not create any problems but when the generic charger is connected, I experience the same issues. On Windows it happens what you describe but on Ubuntu 14.04 (dual boot) I can't even move the cursor...\nUse an external mouse or unplug the charger and see if the problems goes away.\nMaybe you have the same problem.\n", "Q: ubuntu drop to root shell prompt asks for password I'm using ubuntu 14.04 and I messed visudo and now sudo code is not working.\nSo, I tried to fix it but because I'm not root user, I can't access to visudo to fix what I messed. so I tried reboot and use advanced ubuntu, but when I access to drop to root shell prompt, it keep asks password and control d is not working either. What should I do? please help.\n\nA: If your hard drive isn't encrpyted (home folder encryption doesn't matter for this), boot into a live session and manipulate the file from there. Make sure to manipulate the file you find on your internal partition, not the one of the live system.\n", "Q: Cant use Ubuntu I was using compiz config and now I can't access anything. \nWhat can I do to fix this? I was thinking restarting the configuration to factory configuration. Is it possible to enter Ubuntu using terminal?\n\nA: Edit: Since you're unable to access the GUI desktop / are stuck in a login loop, and following up on David Cole's later post, you can remedy the Compviz misconfiguration by first accessing a Terminal at the login screen by holding  Ctrl  +  Alt  +  F1  (alternatively,  Ctrl +  Alt  +  F2 , or +  F3 ).\nOnce in Terminal issue the following command to reset Compviz:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nNow, reboot your system by typing:\nsudo reboot now\n\nThis should have returned Compviz to its default, post-install state.\nFinally, proceed with David Cole's above mentioned instructions to set the default display manager.\nReference: How-To-Geek\n\nA: Note: this fix will work only after completing the steps outlined in mheadroom's post. \nFrom your login screen press and hold  Ctrl  +  Alt  +  F1  to load a non-graphical terminal. If that key combination doesn't work, try  Ctrl  +  Alt  +  F3  instead.\nOnce in terminal type:\nsudo apt-get install gdm && sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nThen select gdm and hit  Enter . Now:\nsudo shutdown now -r\n\nAnd wait for your system to reboot. Bam! You're done!\n", "Q: Cannot access Ubuntu web server site from outside network So I've set up a LAMP web server on Ubuntu 14.04 server distro and installed owncloud as well as wordpress on it.  It's connected to the web via ethernet and connectivity is good as far as I can tell (it can ping sites and pull in updates just fine).  While I am connected to the wireless network from the router to which the server is connected (same network), I can access wordpress and owncloud just fine.  However, the problem comes when I try to access it from a different network location (like from back at my apartment).  The session just times out.\nI checked the port forwarding (ZyXEL PK5001Z-CenturyLink router) for both port 80 and 443 as instructed by http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/ZyXEL/PK5001Z-CenturyLink/Apache.htm.  I've tried pinging each of those ports at the server's IP address with no luck.\nI'm pretty new to programming and networking, so this is probably an easy fix, I just don't know where to look.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  The information for the server and addresses is listed below.  Thank you in advance.\nIP: 192.168.0.170\nURL: fernweh.ddns.net  \"/wordpress\" or \"/owncloud\"\ndynamic ip assigned through noip.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nUPDATE\nOkay, so I configured noip2 as suggested and still no luck.  I also set up port forwarding on a couple higher ports (as suggested as well), still nothing.\nI then checked to see what ports were actually open using\n'nmap -v -sT local'\n\nWhich found 1000 ports, only 2 of which were not filtered\n'80/tcp   http   open\n 443/tcp  https  closed'\n\nDo I need to open up more ports using\n'iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport \"port number\" -j INPUT'\n\nOr is this irrelevant? \n\nA: 192.168.0.170 is a private IP address which the server uses in your private LAN. It may be used by anyone, and is for that reason never routed to the internet. To access the internet, you specified your router as the default gateway. You know that already, because you enabled port-forwarding on the router.\nWhen I ping your DDNS address fernweh.ddns.net it resolves to your internal IP\n$ ping fernweh.ddns.net\nPING fernweh.ddns.net (192.168.0.170) 56(84) bytes of data.\n\nThat cannot work for reasons stated above.\nI suppose you're already running the NoIP client?. If yes, reconfigure it\nsudo /usr/local/bin/noip2 -C\n\nIf not, download and install it like described. Since it is not good style to give a link and nothing else:\nDownload the source tarball to e.g your home folder and unpack\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz\ntar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz\ncd noip-2.1.9-1/\n\nSwitch to root: sudo -s and install\nmake install\n\nFinally, you need to either run noip2 or make it a service so it runs at boot time. (See the README.first in the source folder)\nIt will compile the binaries and lead you through configuration.\nFurthermore: \n\n\n*\n\n*You cannot ping a port. ping works by sending ICMP packages. Unlike TCP/UDP, ICMP has no concept of a port. It might well be, that your router and/or ISP block pings to you.\n\n*As @Zacharee1 and @Daniel already mentioned in the comments, it may also well be, that your ISP blocks well-known ports like HTTP(S). Run your webserver an a high port. That way you also gain a very slight protection against attacks, since a full port-scan is needed to discover the running web server. Note, that this is not a sufficient security measure! Keep your WordPress and OwnCloud installations up-to-date.\n\n", "Q: Speakers are coming up as mic input? For some reason on my computer, whenever i plug in my speaker into the audio jack nothing comes up, but when i plug it into the mic jack it pops up. On windows you can select the input device once you plug it in(whether its a microphone or speaker/headset). On ubuntu i don't get this option, it just assumes the input is a microphone (probably because its a mic jack). So i have no sound, but im sure if i can somehow make ubuntu think that its a speaker plugged in it would work. Any way to change it? I think of the jack as one of those audio/mic slots that work for either or. It's just reading my speaker as a mic\n\nA: There's the alsa-tools-gui package which bundles an application called hda-jack-retask that permits \"retasking\" of hardware audio ports.\nTo install the package run the following in a terminal window ( CTRL  +  ALT  +  t ):\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\n\nAfterwards, you should be able to start hdajackretask and reconfigure the ports as needed.\n", "Q: TextNow for Ubuntu?

I'm running it through Chrome just fine. When you get it, it will appear in your \"Apps\" portion of Chrome.\n\nA: Anbox is an Android emulator I found that allows running Android Apps on any GNU/Linux operating system.

With this method, each share is assigned specific users that can access it. When a user requests a connection to a share, Samba authenticates by validating the given username and password with the authorized users in the configuration file and the passwords in the password database of the Samba server.\nfor more info samba Users and Security.\nthere is several method of security Server-Level ,Domain-Level ,Share-Level etc. so user-level is default . just allow user like:\n[yoursharename]\n    writable = yes\n    valid users = user1,user2,user3\n\nand don't forget to add password to each user in samba using command:\nsudo smbpasswd -a your_user\n\nyou can take help from another Ubuntu question How can I set up Samba shares to only be accessed by certain users?\n\nA: Yes, you can add it in where it should be.  This will be underneath the [global] tag.

Suddenly, if I attempt to boot in using GDM, the following symptoms appear:\n\n\n*\n\n*The GDM background does not go away.\n\n*Windows from two applications (remains of an old session?) are visible.\n\n*No windows can be interacted with (xfwm does not appear to be working).\n\n\nThe xfce panel is present and Whisker Menu can be launched but not interacted with.\nHowever, if I go to tty1 and launch lightdm and log in to the same account, a new and fully operation XFCE session starts (complete with working xfwm4). \nWhile the obvious workaround is to simply use lightdm, I would like to actually fix this new problem that seems to have suddenly begun. I did a complete shutdown last time the system worked normally.\nWhat could cause this and how should I attempt to troubleshoot it? I am a  recent Windows refugee and this is beyond my current realm of knowledge.\n\nA: This might not completely answer your question, but might offer a quick-fix. \nI also have this problem, using Xubuntu 14.10 so something has broken recently... \nI find that the mouse is still responsive (in part) so you are able to RMB the desktop and open a terminal. \nxfwm4 --replace\n\nShould do the trick. \n", "Q: Ubuntu stuck on trial version I am currently running the trial version on Ubuntu (I am very new to Linux) and I am trying to install Ubuntu to have the full version. I am currently trying to dual booting it with windows. I have two hard drives, an SSD and a 1TB hard drive along with that. I have files on both hard drives on windows that I need to keep. On windows I partitioned the 1TB drive into two parts; the files i need to keep on windows, and Ubuntu on the other part (the part I am trying to get Ubuntu on is free space). I also have a usb flash drive with the trial version of Ubuntu on it.\nThe problem I am having is that while on the trial of Ubuntu I open the installer tool (that says \"Install Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\") and install it. It will go through all the installation and ask me to restart my computer. I'll restart my computer, and it will just go to the trial version again.\nNote: I have tried various methods of installing such as letting Ubuntu automatically install, or clicking \"something else\" (which lets you manually partition). \nOne thing that I did notice that may help solve this issue is that when I am selecting Installation Type, the first option is \"Erase Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and reinstall\"\nEdit* When I unplug the USB from the computer I will get an error stating, \"Unable to find a medium containing a live file system\" on startup\n\nA: If you are sure your installation of Ubuntu completed, \nremove live usb and change the boot preference order.\n", "Q: rm -rf recovery in Ubuntu using Terminal How can I recover files deleted in Ubuntu using rm -f /pathtodirectory with only having access to terminal? I tried testdisk but it did nothing and just quit.\n\nA: Unless you have an alias somewhere rm (or /bin/rm) completely deletes a file from the disk. At that point the only way you might be able to recover is use data recovery software.\n", "Q: Wireless connection issue I just installed Xubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 on my Acer laptop and I can't connect to the internet.There's no problem to connect from flash drive live session and there was no problem during installation. Broadcom linux driver is not loading when I click on it. It picks \"do not use this device\" option right away. I don't know how to fix that.\n\nA: Try this, Broadcom uses bcmwl-kernel-source. Those packages and its dependency dkms are on the installation DVD or USB. Insert the install media and go to pool > restricted > b > bcmwl and pool > main > d > dkms drag and drop the bcmwl deb package to some folder on your PC (eg: to your desktop) (Otherwise directly install from the USB or DVD itself). . Now we install the deb files. Open a terminal and:\ncd ~/Desktop\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo modprobe wl\n\nI think it'll solve your issue with wifi connectivity.\n", "Q: How do I restore sddm after corrupted update? A week ago I had a power failure in the middle of an upgrade.  System now has um ... \"issues.\"  Below are the configuration, status, symptoms, etc.  Please help however you can.\nSystem:  kubuntu 15.04, kernel ...-30, 16gb ram, UEFI boot (dual boot, still win 8) with grub, dual nvidia 970 for video and sound to a 4k monitor.\nSymptoms:\nOriginally it was hosed. I reinstalled linux-generic to get it to wake up.  It threw lots of \"failed to load kernel module\" and a reinstall of systemd took care of that.  Worked my way through the boot log messages so that now it comes up in single-user mode fine.\nBut sddm dies.  It tries to come up, but throws segmentation error (11).  \nThe log messages are:\nsddm.log--\n   * Unrecognized OpenGL Version\n   * Cannot create children for parents of a different thread\n   * org.freedescktop.Udisk2 had owner ''\n\nkern.log--\n   * ... not configured to drive a VGA console\n\nOther errors:\nFrequently get Error Initializing Authority ... g-io-err-quark 1.  By frequently, I mean when running commands like systemctl or reboot.\nI tried several things that have been suggested here, and none of them have affected the startx problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*start over with a boot disk (got the infamous \"wubi\" problem, and figured I was better off working with what I had)\n\n*fix fstab  (cleaned up boot log)\n\n*update QT  \n\n*update Mesa\n\n*re-install nvidia-346  \n\n*update policykit-1\n\n*update apport\n\n*manually start sddm (no effect)\n\n*install lightdm (starts x but won't log me on)\n\n*install xdm (won't bring up any usable window-forced reboot)\n\n\nNone of that has made any difference.  Sddm still fails and I still get the above-listed errors.\nThrowing myself at your mercy.  What am I missing?  What to try next?\n\nA: Finally got it over the weekend.  Lots of medium-sized issues, and (if you read that far) a theory as to the cause.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried update from 15.04 install disk.  It died in the same way. \n\n*Did fresh install (over formatted disk) from 15.04.  It died the same\nway. \n\n*Did fresh install from 15.10 disk.  It hung up in the middle.\n\n*Brought in a linux admin friend.  He found the 3-year old \"you MUST\" click the format button on / or the installer hangs\" information.  After that it installed fine, including SDDM start, running X, etc.\nCurrently the system is up and restoring from backup.  It shows that its using nouveau drivers, not nvidia drivers.  I'm not touching it.  It's adequate for now.  The issue was most likely some combination of corruption and crazy version mismatch between nvidia and mesa.\n", "Q: What type of file is the README file in sudoers.d? Just  curious...figured would be a nice file to read with all my administrative privileges and not...LOL.

You can read it by running\nsudo less /etc/sudoers.d/README\n\nThis file isn't really that important to the function of the system, so if you edit it it's not a big deal.\n", "Q: problme with Uget after unistalling elementary-desktop I tried to install elementary-desktop alongside unity on Ubuntu 14.4. I faced some problems so I unistalled it and removed the repository but now I when I open Uget download manger all I have is a blank window ( look at the picture ) :\n \nhere is the terminal output for uget-gtk :\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"pantheon-filechooser-module\"\n\nA: It is not a good idea to install additional desktops with Unity, it does not play well with others. Pantheon, aka elementary-desktop, also does not play well with others so combining them is a recipe for disaster.\nEssentially, what just happened is Pantheon replaced the existing GTK packages and config files. It also seems to have replaced some GTK modules with Pantheon modules which as you've removed are now completely gone.\nI'd suggest saving all of your files and settings that you want to keep before continuing. Once that is done, try uninstalling ubuntu-desktop which will break more stuff but since we have a backup it's ok. Then reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package again to let it reset the stuff that elementary broke.\nThis is not a guaranteed fix but theoretically it should work. If all else fails a reinstall of the entire system would put it back to a usable state. Then you would move your backed up files back onto the new install.\n", "Q: Restore accidentally erased /etc/group file I was trying to modify the /etc/group file, and accidentally cleared its contents. Now, I can't even use sudo anymore, and I don't know what else is broken. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Piecing together information from the Internet, I learned that the system apparently backs up some files, including /etc/group, to /var/backups/[filename].bak. Sure enough, I booted to a live USB, mounted my HD, cd'd to /media/ubuntu/[hard drive], and ran:\nsudo cp var/backups/group.bak etc/group\n\nThen, when I rebooted, my system was good to go. Additionally, you can also boot the system to a root shell. (I've seen how, but I can never quite remember how.) Then, once you've mounted your rootfs as rw and all that, you'd use:\ncp /var/backups/group.bak /etc/group\n\nAnother option would be to check if /etc/group- (note the dash) does exist. If it does you can inspect it and copy it back to /etc/group.\n", "Q: How do I pin an application to the unity dock when it is always fullscreen? I'm running MAME on my Ubuntu desktop, and I'd like to pin it to my launcher. The problem is that MAME always runs in fullscreen with no option to minimize it.

How do I prevent it from affecting again?\nubuntu 12.04, google chrome\n\nA: Since it is a browser hijacker, to get rid of it you can：\n1.Reset browser settings\n2.Disable/Remove Chrome extensions\nIf it does not go away, then you need the third step,\n3.Download removal tool and run it\n\nA: Most likely you are or were infected on a Windows Machine and your Chrome on the Ubuntu machine just synchronized preferences and bookmarks into it, changing your setting on both, if this is the case make sure you have completely removed the infection on the Win machine first or if you logged on Another computer with that account change your @gmail password using another browser such as Midori.\nIf you don't have Midori\nsudo apt-get install midori\n\nAfter that try the following: \nClear your profile \nkillall chrome\nrm -Rf .config/google-chrome/\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Chrome and test without synchronizing.\n\n", "Q: Error Getting Dependencies for Matplotlib I am trying to install the python package matplotlib from source. I cannot install the package from the repository using sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib because I need to be able to install the package in a virtualenv using a requirmenets.txt file.

I have already run sudo apt-get update and\nsudo apt-get upgrade to no avail. Could I just directly install the dependencies listed in the error message (I thought that was the point of the command)? I am not even using Python 3 so not concerned about having the packages installed (though not sure why I need them either). When I try running pip install -r requirements.txt in the virtual environment I still get an error on installing matplotlib.\n\nA: There's a bug in the current Ubuntu 14.04 packaging of Python.\nOne suggested workaround is to downgrade:\napt-get install -y --force-yes python3.4{,-minimal}=3.4.0-2ubuntu1.1 libpython3.4{,-minimal,-stdlib}=3.4.0-2ubuntu1.1\n\nThis worked in my very limited testing, but comments on the bug report indicate that it broke other packages.\nThere's also a proposed update available, which I have not tried. See comments on the bug report for details.\n", "Q: Really simple HTML server for raspberry pi I'm running Ubuntu mate on my raspberry pi 2 b+ . I want to make it hosting an HTMl file. My problem is that I'm low on ressources. E.g. with my main usage program which runs 24/7 on it, there's no memory left for starting Firefox,  so I need a lightweight solution.\nI don't need a complex site, just something that returns this sample.html file if someone accesses http://192.168.178.8 (as sample)\n\nA: I take it, that you really just want to read an HTML document on the Raspi, but the system has not enough memory to start its default browser Firefox. \nYou could try a more lightweight browser like midori. Install with \nsudo apt-get install midori\n\n\nIf you truly need to serve the pages to the local LAN, you need to install a web-server. nginx is resource-wise a good choice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it with\nsudo apt-get install nginx-light nginx-common\n\nThere is also a nginx-full package which brings more functionality, but I don't believe is needed here.\nWhen the installation is done, the server should start automatically. You can control it with\nsudo service nginx start/stop/restart/...\n\nIf you now browse to the address of the Raspi, you will already see a page being served (\"Welcome to nginx...\")\n\n*The welcome page you see is served from /var/www/html. The configuration is stored in /etc/nginx. \nIf you are lazy and want a quick fix, simply put your files into this folder. By default a document index.html is served. If it does not exist, a document tree will be served instead. The directory contains of course the welcome-page. Move it out of the way first. If you want to serve files from a different folder, read on.\nThere exist two directories\n/etc/nginx/sites-available\n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n\nThe first one holds the actual configuration files, while the second contains links to those configuration sites. These links tell nginx to process the config and serve the site. \nFor your goal it suffices to adapt the existing configuration a bit.\n\n\n*First, delete the symlink to default\nsudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\nso the server will not serve the Welcome page by default.\n\n*Now copy default and alter it\ncd /etc/nginx/sites-available\nsudo cp default mysite\n\nName it anyway you like better than mysite.\n\n*Open the file with an editor. Most of the setting are fine, but you need to adapt root so it points to the directory which contains the files you want to serve. This is basically all you need to do, but one option is quite useful:\nindex: Which document is served when the document root http://server/ is browsed. \n\n*Reload the config with \nsudo service nginx reload\n\nand your Pi should serve your webpage!\n\nA: nginx is a lightweight web server, runs well on Raspi\nsudo apt-get -y install nginx\nPlace your default page under /var/www/html\nTo configure edit \n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nA: Install package netcat-openbsd.

I am trying to monitor a log file which rotates frequently by logrotate.\nbut i am unable to get that correctly. can any one explain how actually logrotate works? \nIs a file renamed and a new file is created ?\nor is a file copied with a new name and the current file is emptied?\nBefore rotation:\n131887 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  11385 Sep 25 03:40 /var/log/sas.log\n\nAfter rotation:\n131887 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  0 Sep 25 04:40 /var/log/sas.log\n\n131911 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   11385 Sep  25 04:40 /var/log/sas.log.1\n\n\nA: If the option truncate is enabled in configuration file, then the file will not be moved - its content will only be copied to another file which is newly created and the current file will be cleared, so the inode id will not change. Actually the file is never changed.\n\nA: Upon rotation the current logfile is moved and possibly compressed if that is specified. Then it is created anew. [looking for a source other than my experience]\nThat is a problem if a service is running that has the log file opened at the time of rotation. The file will be unlinked, but the disk space not really freed because the file is still open. \nThat is why services often install a more elaborate logrotate script handling the rotation. As an example look at /etc/logrotate.d/nginx defining rotation behaviour for the nginx webserver:\n[....]\npostrotate\n    invoke-rc.d nginx rotate >/dev/null 2>&1\nendscript\n\nThe postrotate block is executed after the new log file has been created. It invokes the service script of nginx with rotate telling the service to reopen its log file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation, system failed to detect the iSCSI disk I configured a iSCSI SAN disk in HP DL360p G8 server BIOS using card HP 556FLR SP+.

This bug is described here: bug descriprion. My Network controller is MEDIATEK MT7630e 802.11. \nAfter almost a year of waiting appeared a solution described in posts [#244, #240].

I've done the obvious sudo apt-get update but stil not working. Im seriously new to ubuntu so please explain what you want me to do (Thanks alot in advance!)\n\nA: I think you have to enable the universe and multiverse repositories in order to get a clean install of gnome-shell on 14.04 because of all the dependencies. If you would like to add these repositories, run the following commands:\nFirst, make a backup:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/backupsources\n\nThen, edit the file:\nsudo sed -i 's/main/main universe multiverse /g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNext, update your package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nNow, you have two options. First, you could install using apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install eog gnome-shell\n\nAlternatively, it's much easier to install a default desktop on a system that does not yet have an xserver by using tasksel to automate the process somewhat.\nFirst, install tasksel:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\n\nNext, run tasksel, follow the on screen instructions, use the arrow keys to navigate, the spacebar to select or un-select, and the enter as normal.

It will only upgrade existing packages and won't do anything that involves installing new packages or removing old ones, both of which are often required for a full upgrade.\nIt's these other updates that Update Manager wants to apply.\nI would just never use apt-get upgrade and always use apt-get dist-upgrade.\nI also wouldn't pass in -y. Given what I've just said about apt update, that's probably safe, but apt dist-upgrade could do harm if you've done something silly beforehand. Always check to make sure Apt isn't going to do something silly. It takes seconds and saves hours.\n", "Q: SFTP server to respond with HTTPS file I have a REST-API server by HTTPS. I need a way to call the API when a file is retrieved using SFTP. The content is dynamically generated per request. Is there a simple way to do that without having to add user accounts and introduce security holes on the server? Having the key will allow anyone to get the content of the file, but nothing else.\nThis is what I have:\nGET https://myservice/api/items/get?key=XXXX\n\nand doing this shall return the same:\nsftp XXXX@myservice:/items (or sftp myservice:/items/XXXX)\n\n\nA: I think I understand what you mean. You want to generate a file based on the current user (or requested file). You currently do that over HTTPS but you want to also make it available over SFTP... Right? Interesting problem.\nYou might be shocked to hear that I don't think there's anything that can do what you're asking out of the box.... Anything's possible though.\n\nMy first approach involves writing your own filesystem!\nI'd start with FUSE. Moreover, python-fuse. Here's the only tutorial I've ever used for FUSE. It'll get you to the point where you can start to edit things. I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have it list just one [fake] file in readdir()\n\n*Work out how to find the username from the filesystem\n\n*Hotwire open() and read() to pull from a requests.get('your URL') using the username. open() might just need to be faked and read() be a handle on the requests request. \n\n*You'll probably need to patch up and dummy many of the other methods so they return data but it'll obviously be faked most of the time\n\n*Mount this FUSE filesystem somewhere in your SFTP that everybody can see as readonly\n\n\nThis would work for either sftp approach (you could look at the full path instead of the user, for example) but you'll need a single sftp account that people can log in with. \n\nAlternatively, if every user has an account, you could try to monitor access to a directory owned by each user. inotifywatch and inotifywait can let you watch for access to a directory.\ninotifywait -mrq --format '%w' /home/*/magicdir/ | while read DIR; do\n    user=${DIR:6:-10}  # that is based on the length of /home/ and /magicdir/\n    wget -qO $DIR https://path/to/items/${user}\ndone\n\nAnd leave that running somewhere in the background. It'll update the file from the website everytime they access the directory. You might want to check it (with an echo blaaa $DIR) to make sure it's not hammering the server. It may not display a file the first time they load the directory.\n", "Q: Boot from CD Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS running installed on vmware (without LVM), i want to extend the root partition disk space,so i am trying to boot first from CD, i tried both ways:\n- tried to boot from iso, which i used to install the server.\n- tried to boot from real DVD from the DVD PC drive,\nBut in both trials, i couldn't find the \"Try ubuntu\" option, it always shows me installation list\n\n\nA: The Ubuntu Server image does not offer a \"Try Ubuntu\" option like the desktop image does. Booting the image in a VM confirmed OP's experience.\nI suppose one reason is, that the server image does not pack any desktop environments - if you select any such package during installation it will be downloaded from the internet.

I have to explicitely write penguin.com/index.html to see the correct index page.\nBut when I access myname.com, the right index is served !?\nMoreover, when I access those sites with Chrome, this problem doesn't occur and I see the right index page directly.\nIs there a problem with my Apache config ? Or Do you think it's related to Firefox only (maybe it doesn't read /etc/hosts correctly) ? \nEDIT\nJust forgot to mention that when I access page via IP (127.0.0.2/3) I have the same issue in Firefox (only 127.0.0.2 works).\nWith wget, I get the files as expected. So I guess it may be related to browsers and not Apache config.\nEDIT2\nTo \"solve\" the problem I replaced the loopback addresses in /etc/hosts with my local ip address. In addition I replaced the VirtualHost declaration by <VirtualHost *:80> in both files. Works fine now !\nI still wonder why the Firefox couldn't get the right index when given the full loopback ip address though.\nSorry for the long post !\nThank you\n\nA: In this case firefox will check your /etc/hosts as last option for name resolution.\nYou can try this workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open firefox and enter about:config in the URL.  \n\n*Search keyword.enabled and set it to False.  \n\n*Make sure in /etc/nsswitch.conf, hosts entry having files as first option.\n\n", "Q: How do kernel updates differ from kernel upgrades? Today I ran:\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAnd noticed that the following packages were upgraded:\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-65-generic:i386\nlinux-image-3.13.0-65-generic:i386\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-65-generic:i386\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-65:i386\n\nI know that these are updates to the kernel, and checked the /var/log/apt/history file, finding these lines:\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-65-generic:i386 (3.13.0-65.105, 3.13.0-65.106)\nlinux-image-3.13.0-65-generic:i386 (3.13.0-65.105, 3.13.0-65.106)\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-65-generic:i386 (3.13.0-65.105, 3.13.0-65.106)\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-65:i386 (3.13.0-65.105, 3.13.0-65.106)\n\nI figure that this is telling me it's upgraded from the 105 to the 106 build, and assume it's in relation to CVE-2015-7613.\nWhy does this get released as an upgrade rather than becoming 3.13.0-66?\nI noticed some very quick jumps in kernel (minor?) releases a couple of weeks ago, and am curious as to how this is governed.\n\nA: The kernel version numbers are constructed as follows:\n<base kernel version>-<ABI number>.<upload number>\n\nWhenever there is an ABI change in the kernel the ABI number is incremented.  An ABI change can happen for example when: a structure changes, a function prototypes changes, or system calls are added. If there is a new build in which the ABI doesn't change, the upload number may only be incremented. This occurs sometimes when an important CVE needs to be fixed or the kernel is rebuilt due to a regression.\nSource:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/FAQ#Kernel.2BAC8-FAQ.2BAC8-GeneralVersionMeaning.What_does_a_specific_Ubuntu_kernel_version_number_mean.3F\n", "Q: How to backup/restore system custom keyboard shortcuts? Is it possible to backup the custom keyboard shortcuts and restore them when doing a fresh install?\n\nA: Gnome-Control-Center (used by Unity and Gnome Shell) stores its key bindings in the per-user Dconf database directories /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ and /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/ (source).\n\n*\n\n*The easiest way to keep them across system re-installations is to keep the per-user configuration directories (~/.config or more specifically ~/.config/dconf/user for Dconf only). Most of the time it's not necessary or desirable to purge the per-user configuration files anyway.\n\n\n*If you can't or won't keep your old Dconf database you can use the dconf command to export (“dump”) parts of it into a file and import (“load”) it later. The relevant Dconf directories are\n\n*\n\n*/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ for pre-defined shortcuts and\n\n*/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/ for custom, user-defined shortcuts.\n\nThe following example saves the above Dconf directories  to two files keybindings.dconf and custom-keybindings.dconf and then restores them from the same files:\ndconf dump '/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/' > keybindings.dconf\ndconf dump '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/' > custom-keybindings.dconf\n\ndconf load '/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/' < keybindings.dconf\ndconf load '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/' < custom-keybindings.dconf\n\nIf you find that you export your keybindings often, it might be convenient to script the required steps.\n", "Q: Save only specific output to log file I'm using unison to synchronise data to a server, and I've recently created a cronjob for this.

It's exactly the same thing. Remember that on *nix, everything is a file. \nSo, your loop would be something like this:\nfor institute in institute1 institute2 institute3\ndo\n    for scenario in scenario1 scenario2 scenario3\n    do\n        paste \"$institute\"_*_\"$scenario\"* > \"$institute\"_\"$scenario\".out\n    done\ndone\n\nIf you don't know the institute and scenario names, you could just run this for all files and extract them from the filenames (as long as your names don't contain whitespace):\nfor f in *; do echo \"${f/_*} ${f##*_}\"; done | \n    sort -u | while read ins sce; do \n        paste \"$ins\"_*_\"$sce\"* > \"$ins\"_\"$sce\".out\n    done\n\n\nA: If the files are all in the same dir, you can:\nls |\nawk -F_ '{ i=$1; m=$2; s=$3; f[i\"_\"s] = f[i\"_\"s] \" \" $0 }\n         END{ for(insc in f)\n                printf \"paste%s >out_%s.txt\\n\",f[insc],insc\n         }'\n\nwhich splits the filename on \"_\" (-F_), sets the variables i,m,s\nto the first 3 parts of the filename (institute,model,scenario),\nand accumulates in array f the filename. The array is indexed\nonly by the institute and scenario, so all the models are concatenated\n(m isn't used). The final END prints the f array, and uses the index (institute_scenario) as the\nname for the output file. With your examples this produces\npaste wbm_gfdl_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt wbm_hadgem_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt >out_wbm_rcp8p5.txt\npaste matsiro_hadgem_rcp4p5_mississippi.txt matsiro_ipsl_rcp4p5_mississippi.txt >out_matsiro_rcp4p5.txt\npaste matsiro_gfdl_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt matsiro_miroc_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt >out_matsiro_rcp8p5.txt\n\nYou then need to pipe this into the shell to have it executed. Add | sh to the last line above to do this.\n\nTo remove some columns from the input files, you need to alter the awk line\nthat is collecting all the input filenames.  In the 1st awk line:\n{ i=$1; m=$2; s=$3; f[i\"_\"s] = f[i\"_\"s] \" \" $0 }\n\nthe filename is the \"$0\". For example, if you change this line into:\n{ i=$1; m=$2; s=$3; f[i\"_\"s] = f[i\"_\"s] sprintf(\" <(cut -f4 %s)\",$0) }\n\nthen you will get the example output:\npaste <(cut -f4 wbm_gfdl_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt) <(cut -f4 wbm_hadgem_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt) >out_wbm_rcp8p5.txt\n\nbut if you want to cut only the 2nd filename, it is a bit more complicated and\nyou need this instead:\n{ i=$1; m=$2; s=$3; \n  if(f[i\"_\"s]==\"\")add = $0; else add = sprintf(\"<(cut -f4 %s)\",$0);\n  f[i\"_\"s] = f[i\"_\"s] \" \" add }\n\nso you will get\npaste wbm_gfdl_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt <(cut -f4 wbm_hadgem_rcp8p5_mississippi.txt) >out_wbm_rcp8p5.txt\n\nIf sh does not understand the syntax <(cut ...) then replace it by bash.\n\nA: Maybe using ls command.\nSomething like ls $institute_*_$scenario_*.txt should return all files with the same institute and scenario.\n", "Q: what are the proper values for usb device in virtual box I have various windows programs running in virtual boxes.

In case we additionally give the ProductID is becomes less likely we have more than one such device attached, but stillm giving a UUID or the Serial in addition helps to only capture this single known device.\nNote that most but still not all devices are supported by Virtual Box or the guest OS. Some devices may even lead to a boot failure of the guest when defined as a filter. We can not use filters on such devices then. Some USB2.0-devices will not work on an USB3.0 port.\nFor prerequisites when using USB in Virtual Box also see: How to set up USB for Virtualbox?\n", "Q: Migrating from Windows7 to Ubuntu Finally, this is the time to throw Windows to the trash and start working with Ubuntu!\nDue to the fact that I had never did it before I would like to ask first in order to avoid further problems.\nI have one physical hard-disk divided into 2 partitions C and D.\nWindows, naturally, installed on C.\nI would like to format C and install a fresh Ubuntu on it.\nThe question:\nIs partition D still will be accessible in Ubuntu, and if yes, how can I refer to it from within Ubuntu?\n\nA: In Ubuntu there are no drives: there are just disks and partitions and they all get mounted into the file system.\nSo, before you go ahead and install, boot the LiveDVD and use Try Ubuntu first!  Then none of your hard disks will be touched and you can still use the full system and try out everything and it'll be obvious to you that all of your existing data can be found under these kinds of icons:\n\n(Enlarged for better viewing)\nIf you decide after a while to wipe your Windows system partition (your \"C:\") have a look here on how to partition a single Windows-Ubuntu dual boot disk.  Lots of the explanations in there will apply to your question.\n\nA: Unlike windows, Ubuntu recognizes the NTFS file system of your D drive. After installing Ubuntu you will be able to mount  that D drive by simply clicking it on its icon which will be shown on left hand side.\nBefore installing it on your system it will be better if you first try using  Ubuntu via live CD or a live pen drive, which you can easily create using lili(a windows software) and an ISO file for Ubuntu(Can be downloaded from official website of Ubuntu).\n",

Two processes were named \"i686\" and one was \"x86_64\", as displayed by system monitor panel. Figuring they were associated with the kernel, I didn't kill them, but instead rebooted. That took care of it for the rest of the day. Now this morning I come in and find those three processes again, pegging three cores. All three processes started around 1 AM and were still running at 8 AM. I don't have a screen saver running. When I run ps -ef | grep < PID>, I get the following:\nUID      PID    PPID  C STIME TTY      TIME     CMD\nadmin    15071     1 96 01:09 ?        07:02:51 /usr/sbi  <-- \"x86-64\"\nadmin    15080     1 96 01:09 ?        07:11:57 /usr/s    <-- \"i686\"\nadmin    10274     1 97 Oct06 ?        11:39:06 /usr/s    <-- \"i686\"\n\nAnybody else seeing this? How can I determine what is launching it? What is /usr/s ?\nEDIT: I manually killed the processes and my machine is running fine, so they aren't critical system processes.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.\n\nA: These are 100% normal Ubuntu checks and background processes. If you look into what /usr is it is  a root installation file which is necessary for Ubuntu. This is nothing to be worried about.\n", "Q: Can I run a shell script with different profile preferances of Terminal For general use of terminal, I use a transparent theme. But for some purpose, I have a shell script which I would like to run with different profile/theme ( I mean with different foreground and background colors and opacity).\nCan I do anything (Maybe like adding some code to my shell script) , so that I may start the shell script  with different profile.\nPS: I'm on Ubuntu 15.04 and using bash, if that makes any difference.\n\nA: Not by modifying your script, no. The script has no knowledge of the terminal, the terminal is just a graphical window that runs a shell. However, assuming you're using gnome-terminal, you can choose the profile on the commandline:\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=PROFILENAME\n\nSo, if you profile's name is foo, you could write a wrapper script (script1.sh) that executes your script (script2.sh) in a window with that profile:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\ngnome-terminal --window-with-profile=foo -x script2.sh\n\nNow, if you run script1, it will open a new terminal with the right profile and run script2 in it. \n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 (after partition resize) seems doesn't boot if dpm radeon is required in grub.conf premise: partition editing:\nAfter a full backup, I've performed some action to gain more space with my /home and /root partition with Lubuntu 14.04.03 LTS, with Gpartedlive.\npremise: video card\nI've a (video card) ati hd3650AGP, fully supported by free radeon driver as RV635.

It hangs off after completion of the password.\nBack to the 3.13.0-64 kernel works, but still with a system error, pending since about the beginning of the year (beginning approximately for the kernel 3.13.0-40) and never corrected by subsequent upgrades. It seems that the system 14.04 LTS is going worse and worse on this computer. Is there a solution ?\n\nA: Similar problem with my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, on Dell Inspiron n5040, Intel Pentium P6200, and the version of the kernel.

I did copy over the Wingding font to get the smiley face in the top right corner to show if the EA is running properly but there are 'boxes' beside each comment of the EA lines. I would rather not copy over all 250MB of fonts from my windows install over to Ubuntu if I don't have too if this is a font thing then do you know which other specific fonts are needed? if my issue is related to the mfc4* files I haven't copied over yet then I can do that easily enough. See picture showing the weird boxes. Weird Boxes showing in comments\nFollow the steps to fix the problem:\n1.Install Wine if it's not already installed (you obviously have it installed if you are running MetaTrader):\nsudo apt-get install wine\nOnce Wine is installed you need to configure it. This is pretty easy. As a normal user (Not Root!) run winecfg from a terminal and it should set itself up. If you want to do any more configuration or tweaking, have a look around the tabs, but for now I suggest keeping it as default.\n2.From a valid windows installation, copy over all the fonts into your wine installation. It also assumes you told Ubuntu to mount your windows partition in /windows:\ncp /windows/WINDOWS/Fonts/* ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/fonts/\n\n3.Copy two needed DLL files from your valid windows installation:\ncp /windows/WINDOWS/system32/mfc4* ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/\n\n4.Download mt4setup.exe from your favorite broker.\n5.Install MT4.\n\nA: A little late, but might help others.

If you had that enabled, upgraded python3.4 and then disabled it, it would display exactly per your question.\nHowever, it seems trusty-updates recently had python3.4 version 3.4.3 SRUd into it. This is a post-release feature upgrade. They're pretty rare and usually only follow long testing periods in the -proposed repo.\nHowever the SRU update was recently pulled. It was found to break other things and there's been another regression report here on Ask Ubuntu, so they pulled it back to the last trusty-updates version while they work on fixing the SRU.\nThis should trickle through the update system when it's done.

The newer kernel has support for the wifi card. However, this kernel seems to have some issues with older NVIDIA drivers.

Now as the release of 15.10 is coming rather soon, and I am currently running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04, I will be needing to purge some of my PPAs rather soon, but as I have quite a few PPAs I don't know which will need it (other than the two that I already mentioned), the only thing that I do know is that all of those PPAs that will need ppa-purge to be used on them have the String ppa-purge in their PPA description.\nSo is there a simple script or something which can check all the PPA descriptions of all the PPAs installed on my system and report back to me which of those have the String ppa-purge in them?\n\nA: That string containing ppa-purge does not mean anything special.\nIt is recommended to disable all PPA before you upgrade a release.\nIt is even better to purge all PPA.\nOtherwise some dependency problems may occur and the system will not be upgraded properly.\nUbuntu developers do not test compatibility of PPA and system upgrades.

This should help you gain keyboard and mouse access for accessing the Ubuntu desktop.\nLet's start by booting into recovery mode.\nFollow the below instructions which I've grabbed from the Ubuntu Wiki Recovery Mode page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Switch on your computer.\n  \n*Wait until the BIOS has finished loading, or has almost finished. (During this time you will probably see a logo of your computer manufacturer.)\n  \n*Quickly press and hold the  Shift  key, which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you've missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.)\n  \n*Select the line which starts with \"Advanced options\".\n  \n*Select the line ending with \"(recovery mode)\", probably the second line, something like: Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.8.0-26-generic (recovery mode)\n  \n*Press  Return  and your machine will begin the boot process.\n  \n*After a few moments, your workstation should display a menu with a number of options. One of the options (you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the list) will be \"Drop to root shell prompt\". Press  Return  with this option highlighted.\n  \n\nYou should now be at the root shell prompt.\nThere's a semi-related Ask Ubuntu question about the keyboard and mouse locking after suspend. I believe this question's accepted answer to reinstall or install input device drivers should help resolve the issue.\nFrom the shell prompt type the following:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-all \n\nIn case that doesn't work, try:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-input-all\n\nOnce the command completes, reboot your system:\nsudo reboot now\n\nIf all went well you should now be able to access the Ubuntu desktop with your input devices.\n\nA: Thanks to mheadroom,\nI tried the procedure (very detailed) but ran into a wall at the \n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-input-all\n\ncommand which gave me something (originally in french 'cause I'm french) :\n\nLock not used for the file /var/lib/dkpg/lock read only\n\nSo I finally decided to reinstall from scratch (I had nothing special to recover from the boot drive I use), but I specified to format both the / and the the /boot directories I put on different partitions and to leave my /home partition where it was before without re-formatting it). Both are on 2 separate SSD disks.\nIt's working fine now (even I was a bit anxious at the beginning because the two cores - it's a very old Coe 2 Duo @2 Ghz - were both running at 100%).\nThings calmed down after a while : only the teamviewer process I installed  is taking about 5-15% CPU time.\nI'll be able to use this PC for light tasks.\nThanks anyway for your help which can be useful to use in some spécifica cases (I didn't know anything about the recovery mode). \n", "Q: RAWTherapee shows unedited photos with edited colors I like to edit the same photo with different settings and save them under different names.

If I check them with Gwenview they look normal.\nCan anybody help please. RAWTherapee seems to be great, but this annoys me a lot. Thank you.\n\nA: Like Picasa, Rawtherapee makes non-destructive changes to an image.  A small sidecar file containing details of changes is stored in the same folder as the original but the original is untouched.  When you reload the original file into Rawtherapee the changes you made previously are read from the sidecar file and applied.  So you see the image as you last changed it.  If you load the original into an image viewer such as Gwenview the changes are not applied and you see the photo in its original state.  If you want to cancel changes made in Rawtherapee simply locate and delete the sidecar file - it has the extension .pp3.

I tried adding that \"keyboard layout switcher\" app to the task bar, but Russian doesn't show anywhere in its settings, only US does. How can I set up lxde to freely switch between languages, or how can I at least add Russian to that keyboard layout switcher app?\n\nA: I assume that you have installed 14.04 since there is no 14.05.  It is relatively easy to add another language.  Since you had it working in Unity I will also assume that you have also successfully downloaded and installed the Russian language pack.\nThere should be a two letter code or a flag in your LXPanel.  Right click whichever one you have and select  \"Keyboard Layout Handler\" settings.  When the new window opens, uncheck \"keep system layouts\" which is located on the right side of the window.  Then select \"Add\" which will be on the left side of the window.  A list will appear.  Scroll down to Russian.  It will be \"ru\".  Select it and move it up or down wherever you want it.  Before you close the window you must re-check \"keep system layouts.\"  The you can close the window.

Basic setup is as follows.  A desktop and a laptop.  Both have ubuntu installed.  The desktop is going to function as a server.  The laptop is going to function as a workstation.\nBasically, there is a mounted partition on the desktop.  It is mounted and functioning properly on the server.  From here, I would like to know how to properly share and mount the partition on the client.  I've installed smbfs on the server following several sets of instructions on the web.  The obstacle is mounting the share on the laptop workstation.\nI've read several guides and am getting conflicting advice about which protocol to use (CIFS or SMB).  My setup is ubuntu server 14.04 on the server end.  Ubuntu mate 15 on the client.\nAdvice is appreciated.\n\nA: If you're only going to be mounting the drive from another Linux machine and don't require Windows support I would discourage you from using smbfs (aka samba, aka CIFS).  I've never setup a samba share on Linux without ripping at least half of my hair out.\nI would recommend just using NFS- it's simpler, easier to setup, and faster:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-14-04\n\nA: Both Samba and Windows sharing use the SMB protocol.  This has also been called CIFS.  \nIf you want to mount a file system (partition) on your client from the server you will need to install Samba on the server and then configure the services.  Then you will need to share the partition on the server before you can mount it on the client.  \nThe term smbfs refers to a installable package (deprecated), not the protocol or the server.  The current package for the server is samba.  The Samba client routines should be installed by default.

It even crashes when it is the only thing running on my computer beyond the operating system. Every time it crashes it completely freezes almost everything: the mouse pointer will still move but will not click, I can hear the sound from any media I have open, and I can force the computer to turn off by holding down the power button a few seconds, but that is it – I cannot even move to a different window or program.\nWhat should I do to try to remedy this problem?

That way you can have your old version of numpy installed alongside the latest version of numpy and use both of them.

From what I remember there was a line of code that prevented both from existing at the same time, which I removed to fix my issue. How do I fix this problem? I'm also okay with any simpler or new fixes to this problem, so any help is welcome. Thanks!\n\nA: Provided you've installed the proprietary drivers correctly, the file to disable nouveau (the open source Nvidia driver included in Ubuntu) is in\n/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-blacklists-nouveau.conf\n\nor on your system it might be\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\n\nThe line that disables nouveau is\nblacklist nouveau\n\nHowever, you may also need/have the following lines:\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nRemoving those line[s] should allow nouveau to run.\nNow that I've answered your question, I'm going to give you some advice: do not do this. There is a very small chance you will get the GUI to work at all if you re-enable nouveau while you have the proprietary drivers installed. They are not designed to be run side-by-side. In addition, I cannot think of any situation in which you are required to use nouveau and not the proprietary driver. Any situation where nouveau runs, the proprietary driver should as well - and the proprietary driver will work in all the areas that nouveau does not.\nI'm not entirely sure what you remember, but my personal recommendation is if you play any games or do anything with graphics, just use the proprietary driver.

I am getting this error message when I try to access the Windows drive\n \n\nA: Starting with Windows 8, Windows has been using Fast Startup utility, which is hibernating the system instead of completely shutting down, in order to boot up faster the next time you start your computer. This creates a hibernation file on your disk. When a hibernation file is present, that disk is write protected, this is to prevent your Windows session from getting corrupted the next time it starts. You can solve this either by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Executing sudo mount -o ro /dev/sda5 /mount/point where mount/point is the location you want to mount the disk. (Note that this mounts the disk in read-only mode, so you can't edit or create anything on the disk. If you want write permission, move to the second option). \n\n*Going into windows, and shutting it down completely. To do this, hold down the Windows key at the bottom right corner of your keyboard next to Ctrl and press R. Type cmd and press Enter. Then type shutdown -s -t 00 . This will completely shutdown Windows, so when you boot into Ubuntu you won't get that warning.\n\n", "Q: More than one SSL certificate in a virtual host? I have a server running Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS and two running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, of which have SSL certificates on them. All are bitnami stacks so have their apache2 config files in:\n/opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami\n\nThe requirement was for multiple domain name certificates for two domains with and without www. so really 4 in total.\nwebsite.com\nwww.website.com\nwebsite.co.uk\nwww.website.co.uk\n\nIn the end it had one certificate for all these domains set up in the virtual-host _default_:443 section of the Apache2 bitnami.conf file. However the certificate provider suggested having two certificates instead of one (as it would be cheaper). \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to have two certificates in the Apache2 conf when there is only one physical server for both domains? \n\n*If so then how would you set up the virtual-host to handle two certificates?\n\nA: You can only have one certificate per virtualhost. But this is free software. There is no cost (and very little overhead) to just adding a separate virtualhost for each domain with its own certificate.\nUnless the content ever differs, I would go one step further and pick one domains as your main domain and have all the others redirect to it. This is generally best to keep search engines happy (and the links people spread organically will be to the same domain).\nAnyway, that results in three virtualhosts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The one you host from. Eg www.website.com\n\n*One with the same domain but with the alternate prefix (eg website.com) to redirect to the main one, eg website.com. Uses the same certificate.\n\n*One for each alternative TLD (capturing both www and www-less) to redirect.\n\n\n\nThere are some benefits from a single multi-domain certificate:\n\n\n*\n\n*IE8 and earlier on XP and earlier doesn't support SNI which means you need a single, legal IP address per certificate. Multi-domain certs make that easy to work around because you just throw out the same cert for every request.\n\n*Less to update when the cert expires.\n\n\nThat usually doesn't outweigh their cost though. And they're fixed things so if you need to add another domain, you have to pay the full price.

Unfortunately I forgot the password for user secretuser, because it was very secret. So I loggged on with another admin user, say masteruser, and changed the password for secretuser via graphical UI to, say, 'newpass'. When trying to login as secretuser, there was no \"wrong password\" or so when I use 'newpass', but I am sent back to the graphical logon screen immediately after some flash of the screen. So I logged on again as masteruser and did in a shell window:\nmasteruser$ su secretuser\n\nI entered 'newpass' at the prompt and was able to log on to a shell. But still graphical login was not possible. Same effect as before. So I concluded that the graphical dialog does not do it's job completely and gave the command prompt a chance:\nmasteruser$ sudo passwd secretuser\n\nOf course, I had to change to something else, say 'newpass1'. Unfortunately, the graphical login shows the same issue as before, but now, when I su'ed to secretuser, I only saw an encrypted file system. \nmasteruser@zhadum:~$ su secretuser\nPasswort: newpass1\nSignature not found in user keyring\nPerhaps try the interactive 'ecryptfs-mount-private'\nsecretuser@zhadum:/home/masteruser$ cd /home/secretuser\nsecretuser@zhadum:~$ ls\nAccess-Your-Private-Data.desktop  README.txt\nsecretuser@zhadum:~$ \n\nMaybe I took security a bit too far, because now I am completely stuck. Seemingly the password is changed, but it does not work for the graphical login and also not for the decryption of the user's directory. Trying ecryptfs-mount-private as suggested did not work either, because neither 'newpass' nor 'newpass1' were accepted.

By forcing a new passphrase with sudo, without having the old one or being logged in, your wrapped-passphrase file was not decrypted and re-encrypted with the new login passphrase. This is by design to provide real security that any sudo-armed user can't bypass.\nWhen you set up your encrypted home with the eCryptFS tool ecryptfs-migrate-home it asks you to make a backup copy of the actual mount passphrase, just in case a problem like this comes up (you forget your login passphrase or the wrapped-passphrase file is lost or damaged.\nHaving just the login passphrase from when you first created the user probably won't be useful, unless you also have a copy of the wrapped-passphrase file from the same time, using the same login passphrase.\n\nA: Self-answer just to share my insights from this incident:\nWith an encrypted home directory, don't forget your password and your passphrase. You will be lost even when you have other admin users on that machine.\nThis answer to a similar question might provide helpful background info for others. It also explains why I can delete secureuser and will not encrypt a home directory again. \nTogether with the experience from this gem I really think that encrypting the home partition (and only the home partition) has the best security-to-risk ratio.

The partition I cloned had very few media files in it. It contained mostly system files and installed software. since it was my Ubuntu partition. So I guess this seems that compression was indeed used and that the smaller size of the image is perfectly in order.\n\nCorrect, Clonezilla used gzip compression and file splitting when storing the image.\nYou can check this with the file command. That should tell you if it really is a gzip compressed file or something else.\nReducing the file size by half is a typical result when using gzip. Some other compression tools are more efficient but slower (xz, lzma) or a bit less efficient but much faster than gzip (lzop, lz4). And there is also zstd.\nKnowing the compression used on the files, you could decompress the image and loop mount with mount to check if the filesystem is still consistent. The following command can be used to decompress the image:\ncat your_image_name.gz.* | gzip -d > uncompressed_image.img\n\nUse the equivalent program to gzip and refer to the corresponding man page if file returned something else than gzip.\n", "Q: thermald - AMD Phenom II 1035T X6 - how to configure XML? I have a six core AMD CPU - AMD Phenom II 1035T X6 on an ASUS M4A88-t motherboard and I am aware that the CPU temp needs to be kept under 70°C... \nHowever, the fan never seems to come on to regulate the temperature. I am aware of thermald and that thermald.conf controls this, but apparently there is only an example/generic/non-functional XML conf file present in my Ubuntu 15.04. I have read through what I could find on the web but still don't know what specifics are needed to edit this file with. \nHere is my /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml and here is my sensors output\nDo I need to update GRUB? Is there an enable to add to grub? What sensors/cooling zones/thermal zones do I have, how to know?\n\nA: Short answer:\nYour system is correctly configured and you don't need to do anything...\nLong answer:\n\n*\n\n*Your /etc/thermald/thermal-conf.xml contains 2 sections: the actual configuration (lines 6 to 43 in the file on your machine, lines 11 to 48 in your paste) and an example configuration (all the following lines).  Furthermore, your thermal settings are set for maximum performance, not for maximum cooling.\nFor more information on the exotic paramaters, press Ctrl+Alt+T to go to a terminal and type:\n man thermal-conf.xml\n\n\n\n*Your sensors output shows that the CPU fan is running at 3479 rotations per minute (that's 86 rotations per second!) so the CPU fan is working correctly!  You're probably not hearing much as that is inside your tower (assuming a tower model as you're not hearing anything) and it's very probably a super-silent one keeping the CPU T° below the threshold of 95°C.\nNeither the chassis nor the power fan is running at all as the current T° is 44°C, below the 45°C high mark of the motherboard and way below the 75°C critical T°.\nSo the easiest of answers: Don't do anything!\n\n\n*Extra freebie: You don't need to but if you're really paranoid about cooling, change <Preference>PERFORMANCE</Preference> to <Preference>QUIET</Preference>...\n\n\nA: I ultimately installed a liquid cooling system - I'd prefer the peace of mind Running a Yocto project build with 12 tasks going has only gotten the cpu temp to 43C after 15 minutes. \nThanks to Fabby for his help.\n", "Q: 15.04 update 09/07/2015 > How can I repair this catastrophe?

When I install nginx and try running the address it should display Welcome to nginx page. However it still points to the node app I've got running using pm2 package. I have a suspicion that it is due to the setcap I've done in the first article. Can anyone tell me how to reverse this setcap command so I can continue setting up nginx?\n\nA: Sounds like you're still running NodeJS on port 80. You can only run one thing on a port at a time. You need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift this node application back to a high port. That means changing your .listen(80, ...) to .listen(8000, ...) or some other port.\n\n*Have Nginx reverse-proxy back to that port:\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    }\n}\n\nWhat you did with setcap doesn't need to be reversed.

I'm looking for a tool that will layout images into grids dynamically without altering their proportions. The purpose would be to make cutting image printouts much faster for scrapbooking. I know a lot of websites can lay out images dynamically, taking each image size into consideration. Is it possible to run a commandline tool to achieve something like this? If possible, a grid without borders would be much better.\nThere is an extension for photoshop that achieves something like this\nHowever, from what I can see, other options in Linux aren't dynamic and require that all images have the same aspect-ratio. It would be ok if there is a little space left over at the end of a page (as in the example). The priority is to maintain each image's aspect ratio whilst using as much space as possible on the page.\nAn example:\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but photocollage\nseems to do a pretty good job with a bit of tweaking (reducing the border size and hitting regenerate until you're happy).\n\n", "Q: what can be done if shortcuts stop working?

I am currently trying to harden our webserver.  I have noticed that the following users are setup on the server and I believe they are default users that were created when the system was setup.  I am curious if I can delete these users without causing harm.  Also, do these users cause any security issues. The users include: games, new, list, backup, uucp, proxy, messagebus, lp.  \nFinally, there are some other users that previous adminstrators setup.  Is there a way that I can see if they are actually being used by a service or if they are safe to delete.  I appreciate any insight.\nThanks\nBrian\n\nA: Pasting from https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch12.en.html\n\n12.1.12.1 Are all system users necessary?\nYes and no. Debian comes with some predefined users (user id (UID) <\n  99 as described in Debian Policy or /usr/share/doc/base-passwd/README)\n  to ease the installation of some services that require that they run\n  under an appropriate user/UID. If you do not intend to install new\n  services, you can safely remove those users who do not own any files\n  in your system and do not run any services. In any case, the default\n  behavior is that UID's from 0 to 99 are reserved in Debian, and UID's\n  from 100 to 999 are created by packages on install (and deleted when\n  the package is purged).\n\nPlease take a look at the above link for details on this.\n\nA: \nAlso, do these users cause any security issues\n\nNo. Most of them are system daemon and can't actually log in anyways. nobody and nogroup are special cases. ntp is for time synch. You disable those by disabling the service, not the user. \nThe Linux Standard Base Core Specification specifies that UID values in the range 0 to 99 should be statically allocated by the system, and shall not be created by applications, while UIDs from 100 to 499 should be reserved for dynamic allocation by system administrators and post install scripts\n\nI am curious if I can delete these users without causing harm\n\nYes, but with caution and I would advice against it if only for maintenance in the future. There are some noteworthy names: lp is for printermanagement for instance and might be needed. You can also lock a user ... \n passwd {username} -l\n\nand to unlock ...\n passwd {username} -u\n\nYou can also set an impossible to guess password on these account (20+ characters). Both will have the system complain about permissions or access and will alert you if they are used.\n\nIs there a way that I can see if they are actually being used by a service or if they are safe to delete. \n\nHave a look at /var/log and specifically syslog. Als the command last to see the last time a username was used to login. \n\nA: No you cant, those users are there because of some program are using it. To harden your server, remove unnecessary program and it will remove the user tied to it as well as part of the removal process.\n", "Q: How to remove package (sendmail) for which I aborted the installation?

A process in a runnable  state\n         is  either  using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU. A process in unin‐\n         terruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for  disk.\n         The  averages  are  taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages\n         are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load  aver‐\n         age  of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4\n         CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.\nIn a practical sense what the system is telling you is -- wait I'm\n  busy right now.\nTo see a listing of system load use the commands w or top or (if\n  installed) htop. The last two processes are real time so you can\n  actually watch the load go up if you are watching a video or other CPU\n  intensive activity.\n\n\nA: It is an information you get from landscape-sysinfo if you have installed the landscape-common package:\n/etc/update-motd.d$ cat 50-landscape-sysinfo\n#!/bin/sh\n# pam_motd does not carry the environment\n[ -f /etc/default/locale ] && . /etc/default/locale\nexport LANG\ncores=$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo 2>/dev/null)\n[ \"$cores\" -eq \"0\" ] && cores=1\nthreshold=\"${cores:-1}.0\"\nif [ $(echo \"`cut -f1 -d ' ' /proc/loadavg` < $threshold\" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then\n    echo\n    echo -n \"  System information as of \"\n    /bin/date\n    echo\n    /usr/bin/landscape-sysinfo\nelse\n    echo\n    echo \" System information disabled due to load higher than $threshold\"\nfi\n\nIf you want to see permanently the system informations you could delete the if statement.

The following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download source files (normally a tarball file)\n\n*Install dependencies (normally a bunch of libraries)\n\n*Configure, build and either install or just run\n\n\nI am still confused as to what files relate to what etc. so my question might appear as stupid.\nI have 128gb of ssd hard drive space. This is not a lot for me. I need every single bit!\nWhen building from source it compiles the file into a so called dist folder which can then be run (or installed). So my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*As I assume the source files are not needed since I built the software, how do I remove these files safely?\n\n\nA: In most cases (source files are not consistent), you can remove the source files, tarball etc if you want. This however may make it difficult to remove the software depending on how you installed it, and the software itself.\nIf you used checkinstall, or don't think you want to remove the packages later, you can delete the source tarball(s) and free up space easily. If not, see below.\nTarball installers generally work by building anything they need to build, and then copying/moving the files to where they need to be. Some also are helpful by deleting temporary build files after compiling, and/or make a list of what was installed (which often is needed to uninstall, and is why you might not want to delete those files). Anyway some installers may have a uninstall option - e.g. to reverse sudo make install:\nsudo make uninstall\n\nThis varies by installers, you can see if it supports by reading the documentation of the software (this should be included with the package), or by examining the uninstall file. So if you need to use the uninstall option, you may want to keep the source files. They should not be necessary to run most programs normally.\nN.B. You probably can also remove some of the dependencies (the devel packages etc) as those may have only been needed for compiling the software, you don't need them to run it. To free up space generally you can also use the autoremove option with the apt-get command to remove unneeded dependcies.\n", "Q: \"Open with...\" option missing for Pencil documents I can't find the \"Open with...\" option for Pencil documents.\nA \".ep\" file is a saved Pencil document.\nHow can I set the default application to open \".ep\" files since there is no \"Open with...\" option?  \n\nA: This is a 'Pencil' document, specifically a saved wireframe.

Is this normal? Must I create a new desktop file every time?\n\nA: Why should one install or not install the built software, what are the pros and cons of it? \nAnswer: Basically we built the software because of two conditions.\n 1. The software is not available from repository.\n 2. The need to use specific software version that is not also available from repository.  \nThese two points can be the pro. The cons is that package management or software management will be harder. i.e Uninstall will take lot more time just to make sure all files are deleted.\nAfter installing I realize that not desktop file is made for the software. Is this normal? Must I create a new desktop file every time?\nAnswer: Custom build software did not put anything on the desktop unless the install spec had instruction to do so. However, the desktop file should be build if its in the build package inside the build directory.\n\nA: Pros and cons of building from source:\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*When installing from source you know what YOU are compiling and installing. There's no patch that breaks more things than it repairs...\n\n*A lot of the bigger programs/utilities have different functionalities that may be enabled or disabled at compile time.\n\n*If a program is compiled for use on a particular CPU - ARM/Intel - that your system doesn't have, you can recompile it to work with your system.\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some programs have exhausting compile dependencies ... It's easy to screw things up when compiling such programs.\n\n*It takes time :)\n", "Q: Can't install libstdc++ I'm using Ubuntu 15.04, here what I've got:\n ...\n      libstdc++6-4.9-dbg-arm64-cross : Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.8-dbg-arm64-cross but 4.8.4-1ubuntu15cross0.15 is to be installed\n      libstdc++6-4.9-dbg-armel-cross : Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.7-dbg-armel-cross but 4.7.4-2ubuntu1cross1.86 is to be installed\n      libstdc++6-4.9-dbg-armhf-cross : Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.7-dbg-armhf-cross but 4.7.4-2ubuntu1cross1.86 is to be installed\n                                       Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.8-dbg-armhf-cross but 4.8.4-1ubuntu10cross0.15 is to be installed\n      libstdc++6-4.9-dbg-powerpc-cross : Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.8-dbg-powerpc-cross but 4.8.4-1ubuntu10cross0.18 is to be installed\n      libstdc++6-4.9-dbg-ppc64el-cross : Conflicts: libstdc++6-4.8-dbg-ppc64el-cross but 4.8.4-1ubuntu10cross0.7 is to be installed\n     E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: there is no package with name libstdc++  see here.  i think you are looking for libstdc++6.so install using\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6\n\nor\nif you looking for another library that is missing in your system then search which package have that library and install or extract that package and copy library directly .\n", "Q: Accessing MYSQL through terminal I just installed LAMP in my computer through commandline.Now how can I access MYSQL prompt from commandline?I need to use MYSQL to create tables,views and then access them from my Perl script.\n\nA: With ...\nmysql -u {user} -p {database}\n\nThe database is optional. {user} is the user you created when installing.

Availability\n\nI always recommend you install ClamTk from official repositories. Check your distribution first, and always install from trusted sources.\n\n5. Installation\n\nRPMs: The easiest way to install ClamTk is to use the rpms.\n\nFirst, try \"yum install clamtk\". If this does not work, download it and try:\n\n# yum install clamtk*.rpm\n\nTo remove clamtk:\n# yum erase clamtk\n\nSOURCE: Warning: Don't do this.  It's much easier to just double-click a .deb or .rpm.  Really, put down the source. The tarball contains all the sources. One way to do this on Fedora:\n# mkdir -p /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/ClamTk\n# cp lib/*.pm /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/ClamTk\n# chmod +x clamtk\n# cp clamtk /usr/local/bin (or /usr/bin)\n\n    EXAMPLES:   a. $ perl clamtk    or  b. $ chmod +x /path/to/clamtk\n       $ /path/to/clamtk\n\n* Note: If you have installed this program as an rpm or .deb, you do not need to take these steps.\n\n* Note: Did you get errors with this? Check the TROUBLESHOOTING section at the end.\n\nDEBs:\n\nYou should be able to just double-click the .deb file to install it. This assumes you have permissions to install programs, of course. Your package manager should grab any necessary dependencies.\n\nBy the commandline, you can do this:\n\n# dpkg -i clamtk-*.deb\n\nTo remove clamtk:\n# dpkg --purge clamtk\n\nNote that the Debian/Ubuntu builds are gpg-signed.\n\nHowever it does not say where you get these .deb files from in the Installation section, and in the Availability section it suggests that I should be getting ClamTk from the normal repositories, but I have checked there, and it has notg been updated in the repositories for a few months now, and has up to version 5.15 it seems for Vivid, and 5.19 for Wily, although the latest version is 5.20. So how do I get the latest version? Or do I just have to live with the latest version in the repository (or build from source that is)?

Could you explain it to me please? \n\nA: tree : tree lists the contents of directories in a tree-like format. It's a really neat and useful program you can use at the command line to view the structure of your file system.\noutput redirection means store command output somewhere else other than simple printing on  terminal . if you want to store tree command output in file then use command\ntree > test \n\nthat will redirect output to this file. this command will create a file test and if this already exits then it will replace it't content  with tree command output.\nif you don't want to replace and just want to append then use command \ntree >> test\n\nthis will append output of tree command to file test. you can give full path of file where you want to store output. \n\nA: Probably in that context output redirection = redirection of standard output (stdout) to a regular file.\ntree >tree_output.txt\n\nHowever output redirection in general means redirection of one of the default output streams (standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr), normally both directed to the terminal) to anything that can be considered a file (regular file, stderr if stdout is the stream in question, stdout if stderr is the stream in question, pipe, named pipe (FIFO), block device, character device ...), and it's not limited to the redirection of standard output (stdout) to a regular file like in the example.\nSo there are lots of possible output redirections;\nAssuming for the sake of brevity that the output in question is the standard output (stdout), these are the most common possible redirections:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo foo >file: stdout is redirected to a regular file;\n\n*echo foo >&2: stdout is redirected to stderr;\n\n*echo foo | cat: stdout is redirected to a pipe;\n\n*mkfifo fifo && echo foo >fifo: stdout is redirected to a named pipe (FIFO);\n\n*echo foo >/dev/sdX: stdout is redirected to a block device (DON'T DO THAT - it could do nothing but messing up the partition table of the block device in question);\n\n\nMore esoteric redirections:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo foo >/dev/tty: stdout is redirected to a character device, which happens to be the current pseudo-terminal;\n\n*Hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1, logging in, hitting Ctrl+Alt+F7, hitting Ctrl+Alt+T, running echo foo>/dev/tty1 and hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1; stdout is redirected to a character device, which happens to be the first pseudo-terminal;\n\n\nSo output redirection in general means redirection of one of the default output streams (standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr), normally both directed to the terminal) to anything that can be considered a file;\nIn order to run tree using output redirection (and actually showing something on the terminal) there are multiple ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*tree >tree_output.txt && cat tree_output.txt: runs tree redirecting stdout to a regular file;\n\n*tree >&2: runs tree redirecting stdout to stderr;\n\n*tree | cat: runs tree redirecting stdout to a pipe;\n\n*mkfifo fifo && tree >fifo: runs tree redirecting stdout to a named pipe;\n\n*tree >/dev/tty: runs tree redirecting stdout to a character device (the current pseudo-terminal);\n\n*Hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1, logging in, hitting Ctrl+Alt+F7, hitting Ctrl+Alt+T, running echo foo>/dev/tty1 and hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1tree >/dev/tty1: runs tree redirecting stdout to a character device (the first pseudo-terminal);\n\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu 14.04.1 to 14.04.2? I want to run some software that was extensively tested against 14.04.2 and don't want to take the risk that 14.04.3 might be incompatible at some level.\nSo, How can I upgrade My machine form 14.04.01 to 14.04.02?\n\nA: 14.04.2 and 14.04.3 are not \"releases\" in terms of \"do-release-upgrade\".\n\"Point\" releases accumulate security updates and bug fixes that are added to Ubuntu repositories.\nIf you install ordinary updates on Ubuntu 14.04, 14.04.1 or 14.04.2, you will get 14.04.3.\nSo your goal makes no sense.\nThe only difference of the ISO of the point releases is HWE Stack. Kernels are updated to another major version and xserver.\nIf this is your question you can install 3.16 kernel and graphical stack of 14.04.2 by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libqt5gui5 libgles1-mesa-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-utopic:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic\n\nThe command given in the official wiki can brake your system in some cases.\n", "Q: Grub menu not showing at boot after upgrading to Windows 10 in dual boot I have installed Windows 7 and Ubuntu in dual mode in different drives. I replaced Windows 7 with Windows 10. Now only Windows 10 boots; it's not showing the Ubuntu option at boot time.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: First boot to Windows 10 and disable Fast Startup. Here is a tutorial to do this\nNow you need to have live boot Ubuntu (like the way you did when you first installed Ubuntu). You need to have a working internet connection for this.\nAfter you boot to Ubuntu you need to type these commands in terminal line by line:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nAfter Boot Repair software is installed it will launch automatically. Then click on Recommended repair.

However, this doesn't mean that all data is lost. Testdisk includes the program photorec (which you can launch with this command from the terminal) which uses a different approach and probably will be able to recover what's left of your data.\nNote that the file names won't make any sense and that recovered data doesn't necessarily have integrity.\n", "Q: apt & aptitude segfault every time Suddenly aptitude and apt are both bombing with segfaults; it seems to be related to the cache, as in aptitude I see the message \"loading cache\" before it dies:\nOuch!

I may have misunderstood your question though. Please let me know if that's the case.\nThat's not a practical way to do it, and normally we'd rather use ssh to connect directly to the VM using the terminal on your physical computer. This means you can execute commands on your VM, but the output will be sent to the terminal on your physical computer - they won't show up on the VM's GUI screen with a terminal window open.\nFor this to work you must know your VM's IP address and install sshd (sudo apt-get install openssh-server) on the VM, then in your physical computer's terminal, you can execute:\nssh [VM's ip address]\n\nto simply log in to its shell, or\nssh [VM's ip address] command\n\nto execute [command] on the VM. If [command] is a shell script, it needs to be a shell script on the VM. You can also execute commands directly, for example:\nssh 192.168.0.100 ls -la\n\n", "Q: Why does deploying juju charm openstack40.yaml cause network failure? This environment consist of virtual machines running in Ubuntu. The juju server is running in Ubuntu 14.04. I have 4 virtual machines running in ppcel Ubuntu 15.04. The network was functioning properly when the deployment began. As soon as neutron was installed on the bootstrap host the network failed.

The charm deployment failed due to the failure of the network. \nI have checked network configuration and failed to find any problem.

Note that \nthis pertains to using the charm for ppc64el deployment.\nCharm: https://jujucharms.com/u/openstack-charmers-next/openstack-base/40\nThe documentation suggests \"Two cabled network ports on eth0 and eth1 (see below).\"  This is a bit skimpy on what is really needed.  OpenStack setup for \nneutron (networking) is a bit complicated.  See the OpenStack documentation link provided below.  OpenStack would like to have network interface 1 for management use (eth0).  It would like to have network interface 2 for use of neutron based on the eth1 definition in the charms used by the openstack 40 bundle.  Now we originally had eth1 as the external.  But since neutron wants\nto use eth1 per this bundle setup it then intends to use eth1.  When this occurs\nhaving the external ip address on eth1 ends up being ignored and the server\nlooses external connectivity.  \nWhat we needed to do was follow OpenStack documentation to use eth0 as the management interface, we used private network.  We set up eth1 as the \nway OpenStack suggests. See section \"To configure networking:\" in below \nOpenStack URL.   eth1 as\n# The external network interface\nauto INTERFACE_NAME\niface INTERFACE_NAME inet manual\n    up ip link set dev $IFACE up\n    down ip link set dev $IFACE down\n\nNow this has eth0 and eth1 setup per the openstack 40 bundle documentation of \nhaving two network interfaces.  You still have the problem that you need\nto define the external ip address so adding a bridge fixes that problem.  Something list so:\nauto br0 \niface br0 inet static\n       address 9.3.80.444\n       netmask 255.255.255.0\n       network 9.3.80.0\n       broadcast 9.3.80.255\n       gateway 9.3.80.1\n       bridge_ports eth1\n       bridge_fd  9\n       bridge_hello 2\n       bridge_maxage 12\n       bridge_stp off\n\nSo the way we got our initial manual environment server (vm2) to get external access is by fixing /etc/network/interfaces as shown below.\nOpenStack Install Instructions\nNeed to put https: in front of following URL:\n//docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_basic_environment.html#basics-networking\n/etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n   address 192.168.93.76\n   netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\n      up ip link set dev $IFACE up\n      down ip link set dev $IFACE down\n\nauto br0 \niface br0 inet static\n       address 9.3.80.444\n       netmask 255.255.255.0\n       network 9.3.80.0\n       broadcast 9.3.80.255\n       gateway 9.3.80.1\n       bridge_ports eth1\n       bridge_fd  9\n       bridge_hello 2\n       bridge_maxage 12\n       bridge_stp off\n\n#dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed\n        dns-search aus.stglabs.ibm.com\n        dns-nameservers 9.3.1.200 9.0.128.50\n\n\nA: \n\"The network was functioning properly when the deployment began.  As soon as neutron was installed on the bootstrap host the network failed.  The network only failed on the bootstrap host, the network on all others are fine...\"\n\nNot exactly sure what you're trying to say here when you suggest \"a network failure\" in your title and you then suggest that only one computer is affected.  I tend to think of network failures as \"all or most of the computers can't talk to each other\".  Anyway, Neutron is the networking service part of OpenStack in case you haven't figured this out.  It's responsible for managing routing between what's usually your private network and the more public side of things.  Later, when you \"expose\" a service Neutron then is issuing a public IP address to that service so that it can be seen by the outside world.\nWhy does it fail at the Neutron step (from a networking standpoint)?  The most likely cause would be improperly setting up the network configuration.\nRevisit the network settings especially default gateway and netmask.  In MAAS this will be in the Cluster and Network tabs.  Make sure to review every setting and drill down into the Ethernet adapters themselves on the cluster controller.\n", "Q: Trying to make VLC/Quicktime stop but loop Really hoping to make this possible in VLC (2.1.0) or Quicktime (10.4) at a Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Play (lets say) 5 films\n\n*Each film should stop playing at the end\n\n*Than by a so called hotkey the next film should start playing\n\n*At the end (number 5), it should start again at number 1\n\n*All in full screen\n\n\nIs the possible?

However I can't get a working launchpad launcher.\nThe python file cpConverter.py is stored in folder /usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/.\nI have a Shell Script named cpconverter in folder /usr/bin/, which reads:\n#!/bin/sh\n\npython /usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/cpConverter.py\n\nThe Desktop Launcher cpconverter.desktop is simple\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=0.5\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Code Page Converter\nName[en_US]=Code Page Converter\nComment=A simple utility to change the code page of plain text based files\nType=Application\nExec=/usr/bin/cpconverter\nIcon=cpconverter\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nCategories=Utility;\n\nHowever it fails to start.\nI did check that the installed cpConverter.py is working fine by launching it:\n$ python /usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/cpConverter.py\n\nThen the program is launched on some occasions. After clicking the launcher it often don't work anymore.\nHowever the file cpConverter.py in the building structure of the package always works e.g.\n$ python cpconverter-0.5/debian/cpconverter/usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/cpConverter.py\n\nI tried to type the same command line from a Terminal and then I got a variety of unheard of errors (at least for me):\n$ cpconverter\n/usr/bin/cpconverter: 3: /usr/bin/cpconverter: pyhton: not found\n$ \n$ pyhton /usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/cpConverter.py\nNo command 'pyhton' found, did you mean:\n Command 'python' from package 'python-minimal' (main)\npyhton: command not found\n$\n\nThen I tried to take a working example for package convertall which for its Shell Script uses:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexec /usr/bin/python3 /usr/share/convertall/convertall.py \"$@\"\n\nFrom the Terminal I would successfully  launch it with:\n$ python3 /usr/share/convertall/convertall.py \"$@\"\n\nThen I modified the Shell Script in accordance to read:\nexec /usr/bin/python2 /usr/share/cpconverter/cpConverter.py \"$@\"\n\nThe result is still the that the Desktop Launcher is not working ... some hourglass and nothing. However, either of these 3 command lines always launch the program:\n$ python2 /usr/share/cpconverter/cpconverter/cpConverter.py \"$@\"\n$ /usr/bin/cpconverter\n$ cpconverter\n\nThe access rights for the cpconverter.desktop are standard:\n$ ls -l /usr/share/applications/clipgrab.desktop\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 626 Dec  9  2014 /usr/share/applications/clipgrab.desktop\n\nWhy then the Desktop Launcher is unable to launch the program ? What is wrong with my Desktop Launcher ? [See it above]\n\nA: I am not sure if this is really necessary, but when I made a bash script I launched the script with this command \"bash $$$$$$$.sh\". The only reason that I mention this is that the .py extension is not on the script name in your desktop launcher. May be nothing, worth a look and a try.

I've been teaching myself the linux command line through a pdf book, and after the author explains how to use cat and > to make a text file, he says:\n\nWe see that the result is the same as passing a\n  single filename argument.\n\nand i really don't know what he means, despite the fact I haven't skipped over any part of the book. Is he just talking about putting in arguments in the terminal? If this is the case I still don't know what he means.\nEDIT\nhere's the whole paragraph:\n\nUsing the “<” redirection operator, we change the source of standard\n  input from the keyboard to the file lazy_dog.txt. We see that the\n  result is the same as passing a single filename argument. This is not\n  particularly useful compared to passing a filename argument, but it\n  serves to demonstrate using a file as a source of standard input.\n\n\nA: You shall pass (arguments)\n\"Passing an argument\" means adding a parameter after a specific command. The program launched by that command will behave consequently.\nAs an example, the command \"cp\" is used to copy a file and requires two arguments. Firstly the SOURCE FILE and secondly the DESTINATION FILE (or destination directory). Please notice that syntax order is very important here.\ncp <SOURCE FILE> <DESTINATION FILE>\n\nLet's assume that you want to copy \"file.txt\" to \"copy_of_file.txt\". You have to run the command:\ncp file.txt copy_of_file.txt\n\nIt will create a new file, in the same directory (the directory from which you ran the command, where the source file \"file.txt\" should be)\nBoth SOURCE FILE and DESTINATION FILE are arguments passed to the command \"cp\". \nNeed some --help ?\nIf you want to know what or how many arguments a command needs, or what optionals arguments it accepts, you can do:\n<command> --help\n\nfor example: \ncp --help\n\nor\ncat --help\n\nIt will display the \"How to use your command\" into your terminal.\nCuriosity won't kill the cat\nLet's take a look at the cat command.\nIf you run cat with a single argument, let's say a text file :\ncat my_file.txt\n\nIt will display the contents of that file on the terminal.\nIf you run cat with two arguments, it will display both file's contents:\ncat my_first_file.txt my_second_file.txt\n\nThe redirection operator \">\"\nNow, the > (redirection operator) looks a bit more complex, but it's actually very simple.\nIt's a redirection. You have to look at everything that your terminal displays as an output from a command. The output usually goes to the terminal. If you run : \ncat my_file.txt\n\nThe command is 'cat', the argument is \"my_file\", and the output is the content of that file. The output goes to the terminal. Well, when you use  the redirection operator \">\", which requires an argument, what you actually do is redirecting the output to another destination. So, what happens when you run\ncat my_file.txt > new_file.txt\n\nis that instead of displaying the content of the file into your terminal, it will be written into a file, \"new_file.txt\".\nThere is two ways about it.\nSo basicaly, the result of \ncat my_file.txt > copy.txt\n\nand\ncp my_file.txt > copy.txt\n\nare the same : you create a new text file, with the content of another. But the process is very different.\nOne last thing :\n> file.txt\n\nwhile create an empty file (you redirect... nothing to file.txt, so it's empty. Pretty obvious isn't it ?)\nWithout more context, I'm not sure what the authors means, but I hope this helps. Good luck in learning unix, it's a bit hard to start with, but it ends with a lot of fun.\nEDIT 1 :\nI almost forgot to answer :\n\"passing a filename argument\" means passing an argument, and that argument must be a filename, so the name of a file, let's say \"file.txt\". It could also be the full path to the file, something like :\n/home/user/Documents/file.txt\n\n", "Q: Can I switch back? If I were to download this would I be able to switch back to my Windows 10 operating system? I am thinking about switching ,but have been told that it takes a lot of technological knowledge. I am decent with technology, but am a little weary of my \"coding\" abilities. I would like to know if it would be possible to switch back if I can't understand the Linux OS. Please help. It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You will lose any saved data, but yes you can switch back to windows if you want to. You might want to consider downloading VirtualBox for windows and installing ubuntu inside of a virtual machine, that way you will get to try ubuntu from within windows. You get a nice taste of a linux environment without the risk.\n\nA: You do not have to choose one or other my friend if you are not sure Ubuntu is for you I would recommend using the live CD, or dual booting Ubuntu next to windows so you can go back to windows anytime! Best luck! ( You will not lose any windows data or system files with these options!) http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n\nA: It depends on what you intend to do with Ubuntu, but it definitely does not take \" a lot of technological knowledge\". Unless you want or need to do something very specific with your computer, or make a daily use of non-native software, Ubuntu is quite intuitive and easy to learn. You might have to change some habits, but it's no big deal. \nIf you want to keep both windows and Ubuntu for a while before complete switching, dual-boot is an option, although it might requires more technological knowledge. Testing with a live-cd is another option.\nI suggest you do some reading on official documentation, installation and first-step tutorials before trying. Make a list of the software you regularly use, and see if they are available in Ubuntu, or if they have an equivalent available (for example, Microsoft Office > LibreOffice). You'll see that most of them (Skype, Steam, Firefox, Google Chrome, VLC, etc.) are available. \n", "Q: how to restore /etc/apt/sources.list (I removed it by mistake)?

Sometimes, a simple copy/paste of the contents of the iso is enough to make a bootable usb for the OS I try to use, while sometimes, copy paste does not work while other software like unetbootin work. I keep my usb drive in FAT32. \nMy question is why does this happen and why is it not reliable to just copy the iso's contents? In contrast, dd also always works.\n\nA: In general it's always a good idea to have a fresh USB drive made bootable. If you simply copy and past, if for any reason a program had written files to the drive it could corrupt your install. Unless you are copying from a stock folder from your desktop. \nI use Rufus to create my bootable USB drives. You can chose your format and the program will also format the USB drive for you to ensure a good, clean install. It also creates the files that your computer uses to recognize a bootable device.\nCopy and past just leads to issues, it may work, but can break at any time.\n", "Q: Stuck ubuntu logo screen while trying to install from usb I have a notebook with FreeDOS system and I'm trying to install ubuntu 14.04.

I was looking for a good video player to replace VLC, something that is as good as vlc but has seek preview. I am tired of fast forwarding in vlc\nEDIT: I meant seek preview with thumbnails\n\nA: ExMplayer is an MPlayer GUI with thumbnail seeking. The graphical user interface is Qt-based and it depends on mplayer or mplayer2 package.\n\n\nFeatures and performance\nAs version 5.0.1, it lacks some advanced features that you might expect it to have. While it plays any typical H.264/MPEG-4 video clip smoothly, it is not quite a replacement for VLC media player for three reasons below.\n\n*\n\n*Somewhat high memory usage\n\n\n*Significantly high CPU usage\n\n\n*Relatively no option to adjust performance\nThese are based on my brief experience, when comparing ExMplayer 5.0.1 (more than 90% CPU usage) to other players such as VLC media player 2.0.8 and GNOME MPlayer 1.0.5 (both were barely at 10% CPU usage) in Xubuntu 12.04.\nNot tested for ExMplayer 5.5.0.\nAvailability\nExMplayer 5.0.1 (released on 2015-07-28) is available via older PPA on Launchpad for Ubuntu 12.04 until 18.04.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:exmplayer-dev/exmplayer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install exmplayer\n\nExMplayer 5.5.0 (released on 2020-07-21) is available via newer PPA on Launchpad for Ubuntu 20.04 or newer releases.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:exmplayer-dev/exmplayer-qt5\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install exmplayer\n\nElse, visit download page of their project site. While the project site is hosted on Sourceforge, the packages and source code for Linux distributions are linked to Launchpad and GitHub.\nTL;DR ExMplayer is responsive and able to playback video clips without problem. But it is resource hungry, when compared to similar Qt-based VLC media player with default settings and GTK-based GNOME MPlayer.\n\nA: Ever tried or thought about kodi, former xbmc?\nReason why I suggest this: I couldn't think of a reason why you want to replace vlc or a similar player. Fast forwarding is usually used when the pc / nettop or whatever is connected to some kind of television. If that is the case - kodi is a very suited. \n", "Q: launchpad build fails, but pbuilder works This is my first attempt with .deb packaging for a very long time, so it's likely to be a stupid mistake. That said, as heading says: my package builds fine in pbuilder on a trusty 14.04.3 host, but fails on launchpad. FWIW, my gut feeling is that the installation has placed the files in different places.\nThis is based on a debian (jessie) build which was fine. I had to tweak a few dependencies and installation paths, but with those fixes it builds in pbuilder.\nFirst question: What are the possible difference between building in pbuilder and on launchpad?

(Note that you must not use a $ at the end!)\nOne example where you need curly braces are when you need to put a variable in a continuous string.\nExample:\nvar=hel\necho ${var}lo\n\nwill output hello.\n\nA: To answer your main question, ${foo} is called \"parameter expansion\". To be precise, the $ itself starts parameter expansion, the { } are actually optional according to the POSIX specification, but can be useful to indicate the end of the variable's name:\n$ foo=\"bar\"\n$ echo $fooBaz   ## fails, no variable named $fooBaz exists\n\n$ echo ${foo}Baz ## works, $foo is expanded and the string Baz is appended\nbarBaz\n\nBasically, $foo and ${foo} are identical. Apart from cases like the above or when you are doing string manipulation, they are completely  equivalent. \nHowever, you shouldn't really use either of them. The rule of thumb is that, with very few exceptions, you should always use \"$foo\" or \"${foo}\" and never $foo or ${foo}. You should always quote your variables to avoid invoking the split+glob operator (more on that later).  You certainly don't want $foo$. The final $ is irrelevant:\n$ foo=\"bar\"\n$ echo \"$foo$\"\nbar$\n\nSo, while unquoted variables are sometimes OK:\n$ echo $foo\nbar\n\nThey are usually not and should really be avoided:\n$ if [ -n $foo ]; then echo empty; else echo \"not empty\"; fi ## fails\nempty\n\n$ if [ -n \"$foo\" ]; then echo empty; else echo \"not empty\"; fi ## works\nnot empty\n\nNote that the brackets do not help here either:\n$ if [ -n ${foo} ]; then echo empty; else echo \"not empty\"; fi  ## fails\nempty\n\n$ if [ -n \"${foo}\" ]; then echo empty; else echo \"not empty\"; fi ## works\nnot empty\n\nWhen you use $foo or ${foo}, the shell will split the value saved in the variable on whitespace (this can be changed by setting the IFS variable to something else) into a list and then,  each element of the list is treated as a glob pattern and expanded into any matching files or directories. This is known as the split+glob operator. To illustrate, consider a directory with two files:\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 0 Oct  9 18:16 file1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 terdon terdon 0 Oct  9 18:16 file2\n\nNow, let's set a variable to foo *:\n$ foo=\"foo *\"\n\nWhat happens if we try to check if a file with that name exists?\n$ if [ -e $foo ]; then echo \"file exists\"; else echo \"no such file\"; fi\nfile exists\n\nThe variable was split into foo and * and, since * is a wildcard that matches any string, the shell tells you that a file called foo * exxists. However, if we quote it correctly, this doesn't happen:\n$ if [ -e \"$foo\" ]; then echo \"file exists\"; else echo \"no such file\"; fi\nno such file\n\nThat was a trivial example to illustrate the point. Imagine if I had used rm instead of echo though. \nSo, first rule: always quote your variables. You can use either \"$foo\" or \"${foo}\" but quote it either way. For more detail on using variables safely, have a look at these posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*$VAR vs ${VAR} and to quote or not to quote\n\n*Expansion of a shell variable and effect of glob and split on it\n\n*Security implications of forgetting to quote a variable in bash/POSIX shells\n\n*Why do I need to quote variable for if, but not for echo?\n", "Q: Monitor connected through VGA to HDMI converter not always detected I recently bought a new laptop which does not have VGA output.

The product originally come with Ubuntu (so I assume that it should run Ubuntu without any complication). I replaced the OEM HDD to SSD and I tried to install Ubuntu with USB. The installation process was going smoothly but I got a black screen after it reboot. I thought it was a problem in Dell UEFI configuration because I remembered that the original setting was set to legacy. I understand that (1) Ubuntu 14.04 LTS support UEFI boot, (2) UEFI have many advantages over legacy both performance and security so I'd prefer UEFI over legacy. \nPlease advice. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: DELL Inspiron 5558 has hybrid ( Intel / NVIDIA ) graphics.\nThis might be the reason that it boots to a 'black screen'.  \nFirst of all find out whether your special model has NVIDIA graphics hardware.\nSome of the lower priced DELL Inspiron models only have integrated graphics. \nOpen a terminal and execute:  \nlspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'  \n\nThe output should show information about your graphics hardware and look similar to this :  \n \nIf the output shows NVIDIA info install the latest stable NVIDIA driver and Optimus support.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-prime \nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: Computers that ship with Ubuntu pre-installed often include additional drivers or other tweaks to the OS to get everything working. Often these fixes find their way into later releases, but if not, or if you try to install the \"same\" version of the OS using a standard installation medium, you may run into problems with certain hardware -- video drivers, touch pads, WiFi, etc. You may be able to enable a manufacturer- and model-specific PPA to get these things working, or install using media provided by the manufacturer. You should contact Dell about the requirements for your specific model.\nAs to EFI/UEFI, see \"Legacy vs UEFI Help\" for more information. In brief, the advantages of an EFI-mode boot are pretty modest once the OS has booted. Most of the advantages come in various changes to the boot process itself.\n", "Q: Why can't I replace a specific string with sed?

So I conclude that the system itself is not able to retain the given location paths and doesn't remember them after a reboot or start-up!

This is common with /var/www/ scenarios where a webserver and a real user both need to be able to write to a directory. \nsudo usermod -aG www-data $USER\nsudo chgrp www-data /path/to/directory\nsudo chmod -R 774 /path/to/directory\n\nBut don't add your user to the root group; that's silly.\n\n*Change the owner to your user. \nchown -R $USER: /path/to/files\n\nIf no other users (inc system) need access to the directory, make it yours. Obviously this won't work if you're sharing these files with other processes on the system (like a webserver or a system-used application).\n\n*Use ACL. This is a fine-grain permission framework that allows you to add named users to the permissions rosta. Very handy but a bit fiddly to set up.\nStill, don't muck around here. If the file/directory isn't meant to be owned/edited by random people, don't open things up so anything running under your user can edit it.\n\n*Do nothing. Use sudo, sudoedit et al to edit the files and leave their permissions well alone. If they're root-owned for a reason, leave them like that. This is most true of settings. The tiny inconvenience of asking your password is keeping your system safe.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 Update to Vivid HW enablement stack - still getting updates to old kernel Recently i installed the Vivid Hardware enablement stack from the ubuntu wiki (kernel 3.19, xorg 1.17)\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\nand the update happened without problems...\nHowever after going through the packages to-be-upgraded by the update manager, i saw that it included kernel updates to the old 3.13 kernel..!!\nIs that normal? Can it potentially screw up my system? I am unwilling to update, until i know for certain that nothing breaks and keep the 3.19 kernel!\n\nA: To stop updates of 3.13 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04 you need to remove meta-packages. Run in terminal\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic\n\nUpdates of 3.13 kernel can not do any harm.

During the install I receive a number of errors the last of which suggests the install may be broken. Soon after a notification tells me the installation was successful. A system information check tells me I am now running on 15.04. Everything appears to be working fine except I am unable to continue upgrading to 15.10 or shut down the pc in anyway.

Then I set that script to run on boot startup as root with ln -s /etc/init.d/docker /etc/rc2.d/S99docker, and ran sudo reboot. After that, I'm back running the Docker (1.8.3) service on boot, from a raw binary installation:\n$ service docker status\n * Docker is running\n\nLooks all good here - I can run $ docker run -it hello-world correctly now too, and keep moving until 18180 is fixed.\n", "Q: How do I prevent domains from resolving to a specific address?

Can you help me with this problem?\nI want to detach a process I start in a server. This process is an application with one window/widget (similar to gedit, kate...).

I have used screen and tmux, but the problem is that once I run the process, the window is oppened remotely from the server to my computer. Then, I would like to let the process openned, so I close the screen/tmux, and  once I exit the ssh connection, the terminal waits till I close the process window, thus killing the process in the server.\nIs there any way to let the process detached even with the process X windows?\nThank you,\nJames\n\nA: From the question on SO:\nI don't think it is possible over ssh. When you have such process, it needs to communicate with the X server (which is running on your client). You can't just take it away from the process.\nIf you need to run processes with X detached, you need to use X server on that remote machine. For this use case, VNC is probably better solution, since it can create virtual displays that are available even after disconnect.\n\nA: Use better ssh options\nnohup ssh -p xxxx -i ~/.ssh/key -X -C -c blowfish -N user@server <command> &\n\n-p port (if you are not using the default 22)\n-x = allows X forwarding\n-C -c = compression and compression protocol (IMO blowfish is fastest)\n-N = no console\nnophu - allows you to close the terminal if you wish\n = command to run (gedit, etc)\nDepending on what you want, you can port forward (better of apps such as firefox).\n", "Q: Wireless 3945ABG [Golan]: Device not ready, fresh Ubuntu install I have a Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] network adapter in my Gateway NX570X laptop.

I have a Ubuntu 14 server. I check total connections using following command:\n\nnetstat -an | grep tcp | awk '{print $5}' | cut -f 1 -d : | sort |\n  uniq -c | sort -n\n\nThen I use following iptables rule to block the culprit IP.\n\niptables -I INPUT 1 -s x.x.x.x -j DROP\n\nIt works all fine and block the IP address. However, I cannot stay online 24/7 to monitor server. I was wondering if there is any Shell script I can use to do it automatically? For example, if an IP opens more than X number of connections at any time, it should be automatically get banned by above iptables rule. \n\nA: First of all, don't reinvent the wheel. That's precisely what denyhosts is for:\n   DenyHosts  is a python program that automatically blocks ssh attacks by\n   adding entries to /etc/hosts.deny.  DenyHosts will  also  inform  Linux\n   administrators  about  offending  hosts,  attacked users and suspicious\n   logins.\n\nAs far as I know, denyhosts is only for ssh connections but there's also \nfail2ban that deals with pretty much anything:\n   Fail2Ban consists of a client, server and configuration files to  limit\n   brute force authentication attempts.\n\n   The  server  program  fail2ban-server is responsible for monitoring log\n   files and issuing ban/unban commands.  It  gets  configured  through  a\n   simple  protocol  by fail2ban-client, which can also read configuration\n   files and issue corresponding configuration commands to the server.\n\nBoth are available in the repositories:\nsudo apt-get install denyhosts fail2ban\n\n\nYou could also script this, if you like. Something like:\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\nnetstat -an | \n    awk -vmax=100 '/tcp/{split($5,a,\":\"); if(a[1] > 0 && a[1]!=\"0.0.0.0\"){c[a[1]]++}}\n    END{for(ip in c){if(c[ip]>max){print ip}}}' |\n        while read ip; do iptables -I INPUT 1 -s \"$ip\" -j DROP; done\n\nThe awk will extract the IPs and count them and only print those that appear more than max times (here, -vmax=100, change it accordingly). The IPs are then fed to a while loop that runs the relevant iptables rule. \nTo run this 24/7, I would make a cronjob that runs the command above every  minute or so. Add this line to /etc/crontab\n* * * * * root /path/to/script.sh\n\n\nA: A possible alternative option is to identify and deal with the problem IP addresses all within the iptables rule set, using the recent module. The challenge with this method is the default hitcount limit of 20, so one needs to either deviate from the defaults or create higher level carry counters to achieve a higher hitcount trigger point.\nThe below example is from my iptables rule set, and will ban an ip address for just over 1 day if it makes 80 new TCP connections on port 80 in less than 12 minutes. Once on the bad guy list, any attempt to connect will reset the 1 day counter to 0. This method could go to a maximum 400 hits before expansion to another carry would be required (and I have tested another carry chain). Note that the code as posted has the infrastructure to be used to only ban for a long time upon multiple shorter time triggers. Currently, I have it set to just ban for a long time upon the first trigger.\n#######################################################################\n# USER DEFINED CHAIN SUBROUTINES:\n#\n# http-new-in4\n#\n# A NEW Connection on port 80 part 4.\n#\n# multiple hits on the banned list means you get a one day ban.\n# (I re-load the firewall rule set often, so going longer makes\n# little sense.)\n#\n# Custom tables must exist before being referenced, hence the order\n# of these sub-toutines.\n#\n# Place holder routine, but tested.

You have plenty of space in /dev/sda4, so decrease the size of /dev/sda4, then increase the size of /dev/sda2.\nBoot into a live system so no partition is mounted, then open GParted. Make sure swap isn't used either (if you have a swap partition) by right-clicking it and choosing \"swap off\".\nThen resize your partitions as you choose. Resizing from the right hand side of a partition is generally fast, resizing from the left and moving a partition is generally slow.\nKeep in mind that playing with partitions is dangerous, especially if there is a power failure, so make sure to have a backup.\n", "Q: How to permanently set /proc/fs/cifs/SecurityFlags? I have edited /proc/fs/cifs/SecurityFlags to allow my cifs mounts to mount correctly. (I had to use value 0x81.)\nTo edit SecurityFlags I type modprobe cifs which then lets me see the /proc/fs/cifs directory (I cant see it before I type this command).\nAfter I reboot, the value in SecurityFlags has reset back to default, which is 0x7.\nHow can set this permanently so it will hold the 0x81 value after reboot?\n\nA: It is set as an option when the kernel is compiled\n/proc is a virtual file system, see http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html\n\n/proc is very special in that it is also a virtual filesystem. It's\n  sometimes referred to as a process information pseudo-file system. It\n  doesn't contain 'real' files but runtime system information (e.g.\n  system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, etc). For this\n  reason it can be regarded as a control and information centre for the\n  kernel. In fact, quite a lot of system utilities are simply calls to\n  files in this directory. For example, 'lsmod' is the same as 'cat\n  /proc/modules' while 'lspci' is a synonym for 'cat /proc/pci'. By\n  altering files located in this directory you can even read/change\n  kernel parameters (sysctl) while the system is running.\n\nSee https://www.kernel.org/doc/readme/Documentation-filesystems-cifs-README\n\nSecurityFlags     Flags which control security negotiation and            also\n  packet signing. Authentication (may/must)             flags (e.g. for NTLM\n  and/or NTLMv2) may be combined with           the signing flags.  Specifying\n  two different password            hashing mechanisms (as \"must use\") on the\n  other hand            does not make much sense. Default flags are \n                0x07007             (NTLM, NTLMv2 and packet signing allowed).  The maximum             allowable flags if you want to allow mounts to servers\n            using weaker password hashes is 0x37037 (lanman,            plaintext,\n  ntlm, ntlmv2, signing allowed).  Some             SecurityFlags require the\n  corresponding menuconfig          options to be enabled (lanman and\n  plaintext require             CONFIG_CIFS_WEAK_PW_HASH for example).  Enabling\n            plaintext authentication currently requires also            enabling lanman\n  authentication in the security flags          because the cifs module only\n  supports sending          laintext passwords using the older lanman dialect\n            form of the session setup SMB.  (e.g. for authentication            using\n  plain text passwords, set the SecurityFlags           to 0x30030):\n\n        may use packet signing              0x00001\n        must use packet signing             0x01001\n        may use NTLM (most common password hash)    0x00002\n        must use NTLM                   0x02002\n        may use NTLMv2                  0x00004\n        must use NTLMv2                 0x04004\n        may use Kerberos security           0x00008\n        must use Kerberos               0x08008\n        may use lanman (weak) password hash         0x00010\n        must use lanman password hash           0x10010\n        may use plaintext passwords             0x00020\n        must use plaintext passwords            0x20020\n        (reserved for future packet encryption)     0x00040\n\nYou can overide this with mount options\nSee https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/mount.cifs.8.html\n\nsec= Security mode.

This will set the value everytime the cifs module is loaded.

Tilda's default keybinding is the tilde key (~) or sometimes F12. Both guake and yakuake bind to F12 by default. Try pressing one of those keys and see if the terminal disappears.  \nYou can use apt-cache to quickly see if one or more of these emulators are installed:  \napt-cache policy tilda guake yakuake | grep Installed -B 1\n\nFrom there you can either uninstall the offending application or change its keybinding.  \nMy bet is on tilda, as it actually ships default in Ubuntu MATE 15.04.\n\nA: You can kill any GUI program with xkill command and selecting the appropriate window. Your bigger issue is figuring out what drop down terminal you've installed.

I also tried to add them manually with MAC addresses, but still no luck.\nSo I am wondering if I did wrong with the lan wirings. Or is it because of the wrong setting of the PXE in the BIOS maybe? (but I think it should work for manual addition, regardless of PXE)\nPlease help me.. All my lab members are relying on me..\nAny comments will be helpful. Thank you.\n\nA: Assuming that each slave (node) has only one Ethernet adapter in it...\nMake sure that each node's Ethernet adapter is connected to the same Ethernet switch.  Make sure that one Ethernet adapter from your MaaS controller is also plugged into that switch.  If you want, you can label that switch \"Private\".\nIn MaaS, make sure that you issue a good network address range (CIDR) to this Private network.  You might issue 10.1.1.0 as the network, 24 or 255.255.255.0 as the mask and bind 10.1.1.1 to the Ethernet adapter in the MaaS controller.  When defining the cluster you could indicate that static addresses are from 10.1.1.10 through 10.1.1.50 and dynamic addresses are from 10.1.1.100 through 10.1.1.200, for example.\nNow for the other Ethernet adapter in your cluster controller, this would be the one that faces the Internet.  Typically, you would connect this one to a different Ethernet switch.  The network would be something else appropriate for your existing setup.  As long as you issue a unique IP address within this range and set the default gateway to point to the next upstream router then things should work smoothly.\nIt's important that each node can fetch software from the Internet so the routing must be correct to allow for this.  The cluster controller typically only provides DHCP for the Private side of this, btw.  People often already have an existing system in place when they add a MaaS controller and they don't want MaaS taking over things on the opposite side of the network.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi is not working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Here is the information gathered about my wi-fi using the script provided by you guys here at AskUbuntu: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12733543/\nI use a laptop dualboot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI just moved to a hostel and the wifi is provided by the hostel.\nIn the first few days, I had no problem using the wifi.

In my case, it was LinuxDC++. In such a scenario, one's files are usually in the hidden folders in home directory. I found mine in one of the FileLists in .dc++ folder.\nTo view hidden files/folders, press Ctrl+H in the desired directory. The files/folders whose names begin with a . are the hidden ones; you are most likely to find your files there.\n", "Q: VirtualBox not seeing USB devices even though I am in vboxusers group My host OS is Ubuntu 15.04 and my guest OS is Windows 10.

You need to upgrade to version 5.0.6. and install the Extension Pack.\n\nA: For anyone experiencing this issue while having $USER in vboxusers, what helped for me was just to upgrade VirtualBox to the latest version (5.0.6 at the time of writing).\nVirtualBox's update check didn't work for me in 5.0.2 (content access network error, apparently a known issue) so I suspect it didn't upgrade automatically, so I had to do it myself.\nAlso, @Pilot6 was technically right about VirtualBox Extension Pack having to be installed for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 and VirtualBox itself prompted me to upgrade Extension Pack right after I upgraded the software itself, so credit goes to him as well.\n", "Q: Missing OpenJDK Java8 in \"Open with\" in Ubuntu 15.04 when trying to run .jar file I'm a complete novice to ubuntu, so i do hope that someone can guide me through so i can chose OpenJDK Java8 in \"Open with\" menu in Ubuntu 15.04 when trying to run .jar file\n\nA: There is no desktop file in the openjdk-8 packages.\nTherefore you have to create your own desktop file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new desktop file\nnano ~/.local/share/applications/openjdk8.desktop\n\n\n*Add the definitions below\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Open JDK 8 Runtime\nComment=Open JDK 8 Runtime\nExec=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -jar %f\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=java\nMimeType=application/x-java-archive;application/java-archive;application/x-jar;\nNoDisplay=true\n\n\n*Restart nautilus\nnautilus -q\n\n", "Q: No launch button on newly installed application I have tried to install two applications, bluej and bracket.

Now I want to install another ubuntu server as vm - but I don't have VNC access. \nvirsh console [myvm] \n\njust shows a blank screen \nWould it be possible to install the guest os from within the ssh session of my host? \n\nA: KVM is very handy you can use VNC, Spice or Console to see the display.\nThe reason you seeing the blank screen is due to no screen redirection to host console, thus you cant see anything from virsh console command.\nRedirect display to host serial port TTYS0 and disable graphic install.\n\nvirt-install -n test -r 1024 --vcpus=1 --os-variant=rhel5.4 --accelerate --nographics -v  --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/shared-storage/test.img,size=20 --extra-args \"console=ttyS0\" --location /home/justin/Downloads/CentOS-5.7-x86_64-netinstall.iso\n\nAbove installation method only working if virt-install executed and running as root. \nNote: Even you running as root, virt-install will switch the privileges to qemu.

So I'm trying to erase ubuntu 12.04 and install 14.04 directly to the same partition of 12.04. My computer is running wondows 7, with ubuntu 12.04 installed alongside.

All other ntfs partitions are left as do not use the partition. Boot loader should be installed at the beginning of the drive in which your ubuntu is going to be installed. (In my case, it's /dev/sda/.) So my final settings are like this:\n\nClick install now, and it Worked!!! Thanks everyone!\n\nA: *\n\n*Choose \"something else\".\n\n*Select your sda5 as your / partition (mount point) and click to format it.\n\n*Select sda6 partition to be used as swap.\n\n\nThat will install Ubuntu the same way it was installed before. \n\nA: As for the new Ubuntu 14.04 installation I'll suggest you to use the sda5/ partition and let the swap partition as it is.\nAlso, the SWAP partition acts as an overflow to your (RAM) memory.

That's like checking for spam, except it's done by your client (Evolution), not by your provider (for example Google). So check the folder Junk to find your emails (and maybe move them to your inbox).\nYou might also have different folders in which your emails provider sorts incoming emails because he wants to categorize them into communication, shopping, banking, forums, newsletters, notifications, you name it.

Specifically I'd like to specify several mount options: \"nodev,noexec,x-gvfs-show\", preferably within the specific udev rule used to mount it, since it deals with one very specific physical medium.\nWith no option specified, the volume mounts so:\n$ cat /proc/mounts | grep -e MYLABEL\n/dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/MYLABEL ext3 rw,relatime,data=ordered 0 0\n\nTo specify mount options I tried to expand the udev rule from the previous solution so: \nKERNEL==\"mmc*\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"______\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/sbin/mount_by.sh '%E{ID_FS_LABEL}' '%E{ID_FS_UUID}' 'nodev,noexec,x-gvfs-show'\"\n\nwhere /usr/local/sbin/mount_by.sh includes:\n#!/bin/sh\n/bin/mount \"/dev/disk/by-uuid/$2\" \"/mnt/$1\" -o \"$3\"\n\nThe above breaks quietly as root defined mount options seem to be rejected and the volume (an SD card) is silently mounted at /media/MYUSER/MYLABEL.\nWhat's wrong ? \n\nWhat I tried to do: \nThe many posts I have seen dealing with mount-option(s) specification difficulties when using udev (e.g. 1,2,...) remain unanswered. \nOne deals with the GVFS option x-gvfs-show used in conjunction with udev rules, when the mounted volume must appear under Devices on the Nautilus GUI and the non-root user must be able to unmount it. To at least get that last aspect covered, I reverted to NOT specifying mount option in my udev rules but added an /etc/fstab entry, a pretty ugly hack given the fact I keep a functioning udev rule for the same uuid volume in parallel. Still, I added :\nUUID=_________ /mnt/MYLABEL ext3 nodev,noexec,x-gvfs-show 0 2\n\nThe FS is mounted but although it appears as intended in Nautilus, cat /proc/mounts | grep -e MYLABEL yields the same result as before... i.e. options nodev,noexec appear to be blithely ignored.\nNot too surprisingly I also get the error message on screen:\n\nUnable to mount MYLABEL. \n  Device /dev/mmcblk0p1 is already mounted at `/mnt/MYLABEL'.\n\nAny thought anyone ?\nBOUNTY Please try to provide a canonical answer that can serve this OP and the whole lot of people interested in specifying mount-options via a udev rule. If not possible, please explain why and provide a viable workaround. Cheers.\n\nA: The script \n#!/bin/sh\nexport mount_point=\"/mnt/$1\"\nexisting_device=$(awk '$2 == ENVIRON[\"mount_point\"] {print $1; exit}' < /proc/mounts)\nif [ -n \"$existing_device\" ]; then\n  exit 1\nfi\nmkdir -p \"$mount_point\"\nsleep 1 # Perhaps not necessary, but in the test with the OP it was necessary\nmount \"/dev/disk/by-uuid/$2\" \"$mount_point\" -o \"$3\"\nexit 0\n\nshould work perfect with a udev-rule like this (you have to replace the UUID)\nKERNEL==\"mmc*\", ENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"13ededb9-41e9-4674-b9dc-40ce178af91d\", RUN+=\"/usr/local/bin/mount_by '%E{ID_PART_ENTRY_NAME}' '%E{ID_FS_UUID}' nodev,noexec\"\n\nBecause the udev-rules runs as root, the -o will be used.\nThe bad thing, definitely in my system, x-gvfs-show doesn't work in the option list for -o\n\nA: You shouldn't be using a udev rule to do this.  For one, it is conflicting with udisks: they are both trying to mount the drive in different places, and which one wins is anyone's guess.  Also when you are done with the drive, you want to be able to right click on it in the gui and eject it, but you can't do that if the udev rule mounted it.\nIf you want it mounted with custom options or a custom location, you just need to add an entry to /etc/fstab for it, and make sure you include the \"user\" option, which allows non root users to auto mount it with udisks, and then they can later unmount it.\n\nA: To complete A.B.'s answer and for the record: \nMount options can  be specified inside udev rules ... under certain conditions. As I ran tests I noticed that some options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*accepted and enforced: ro, rw, nodev, noexec\n\n*accepted and ignored: comment=x-gvfs-show, \n\n*not accepted, in that they break the udev rule: mode=0XYZ, x-gvfs-show\nIn the latter case, breaking the udev rule means udisk auto-mounts the medium with default options.\nThe udev tag MODE=\"0550\", you could think equivalent to invoking the read-only (ro) mount-option, is ignored. Note that specifying ro or rw does not show in Nautilus as you'd expect. Oddly permissions displayed by Nautilus remain unchanged, whereas trying to write if  ro is set will result in a warning message and write permission denial. Bug ?\nLast but not least, do not arrange for an /etc/fstab entry at the same time you specify a udev mount rule for a given device. That will results in a conflict and an error message as udisk will compete with your udev rule to mount the device. No surprise in that. The device will still be mounted though (in my case, by the udev rule - please don't ask why...) and can even be accessed. \nHTH a bit.\n", "Q: How to bridge a wireless interface with another wireless interface (both on the same computer)? Ubuntu 14.04\nBasically I am trying to accomplish the following setup -\nwireless internet ---> wlan0 of Ubuntu computer \"bridged to\" wlan1 of same Ubuntu computer ---> device with wifi\nThe reason for this setup is that the wireless internet is a WPA2 Enterprise network which my device with wifi cannot connect to. (The device with wifi also cannot connect to peer-to-peer networks or ad-hoc networks.) Also, the wireless internet source has no whitelist / blacklist and therefore there is no issue with it seeing the device's MAC address (if necessary), and no issue with it assigning an IP address to the device (if necessary). It is the device that has an issue with WPA2 Enterprise authentication.\n[EDIT - As the device cannot successfully authenticate, the wireless internet source is NOT likely to assign an IP address to the device, and also likely to take issue with seeing the device's MAC address.]\nwlan0 is an Intel wireless chipset / interface which cannot be set to either access point mode or master mode, and therefore is used to connect to the WPA2 Enterprise internet source.\nwlan1 is to be set to access point mode.\nObviously, the \"bridge\" between wlan0 and wlan1 is not meant to be wireless, as both are on the same computer.\n(1) I believe brctl cannot bridge a wireless interface (wlan0) to another wireless interface (wlan1).\nIs this correct?\n(2) If brctl cannot be used, can I still use hostapd?\n(3) If brctl cannot be used, what should I be looking for to accomplish the setup described above?\n(4) Would any of the following be a part of the solution to my problem -\n(a) dnsmasq to serve DHCP\n(b) hostapd\n(c) static IP address (for wlan1 ???) (for the device connected to wlan1 ??)\n(d) NAT (Network Address Translation)\n(e) iptables\n(f) IP Masquerade\n(g) sudo iw set dev wlan0 4addr on\n(h) WDS (wireless distribution system)\n(i) IP Forwarding ?\nThank you.\n\nA: \n(1) I believe brctl cannot bridge a wireless interface (wlan0) to another wireless interface (wlan1). Is this correct?\n\nThe requirement here is that all interfaces must be able to send packets with any source MAC address, and receive packets with any destination MAC (not just the device's own).\nWi-Fi AP interfaces can be bridged just fine (most \"wireless routers\" in fact have a plain Linux bridge between AP and Ethernet). Station-mode interfaces, however, cannot. So you can bridge wlan1 but not wlan0.\nThere's a way around it – the \"4addr\" mode aka \"WDS\" mode, which adds an extra MAC address field to Wi-Fi frames. You can enable it via iw, as long as your Wi-Fi driver supports it. Once enabled, you will be able to bridge wlan0 as well.\nHowever, for security reasons, many APs don't allow 4addr mode by default. (Some have a general toggle, some have a MAC-based whitelist.) Will it work with your university AP? Try it and see.\n(Another workaround is \"arpnat\" – like NAT but applied to MAC addresses – but it can confuse DHCP servers, and it's not supported by regular Linux anyway. Some APs, like PicoStation, support it in station mode.)\n\n(2) If brctl cannot be used, can I still use hostapd?\n\nDepends on your Wi-Fi driver. Most of them should support AP mode nowadays, but not all do. Use iw phy0 info, iw phy1 info to find out.\n\n(3) If brctl cannot be used, what should I be looking for to accomplish the setup described above?\n\nThe most common alternative approach would be IP NAT (masquerading) using iptables.\nIn some cases, regular routing (without NAT) would also work.\n\n(4) Would any of the following be a part of the solution to my problem\n(a) dnsmasq to serve DHCP (b) hostapd (c) static IP address (for wlan1 ???) (for the device connected to wlan1 ??) (d) NAT (Network Address Translation) (e) iptables (f) IP Masquerade (g) sudo iw set dev wlan0 4addr on (h) WDS (wireless distribution system) (i) IP Forwarding ?\n\nyes, no, no, yes, maybe, maybe, what, uh, are you just throwing assorted terms here?\n\nA: You can bridge wireless interfaces using brctl without any problem:\nbrctl addbr br_name\nbrctl addif br_name wlan0\nbrctl addif br_name wlan1 \n\nBut you will need to refer the bridge br_name itself, not to the separate interfaces in you network config.\n", "Q: downloading a software that States it requires windows?

(unlikely)\nCould resizing have changed the GUID of the drive/partition?\n\nA: From the comments, I gather the problem is fixed; however, I want to offer some explanations and clarifications, so....\n\nI had UEFI turned off I think.\n\nThe vast majority of EFI-capable computers use EFI firmware. It cannot be turned off. Some such computers do enable you to force a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot, but the EFI is still running underneath it all. Most EFIs don't even let you truly force a BIOS-mode boot; enabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) just makes a BIOS-mode boot an option, not a requirement. To understand this, consider an analogy: The CSM (which enables BIOS/legacy-mode booting) is to EFI what dosemu is to Linux -- both enable a more sophisticated environment (EFI or Linux) to run programs written for a less sophisticated environment (BIOS or DOS). When you run a DOS program via dosemu under Linux, though, the computer is still running Linux; and when you boot a BIOS-mode OS via the CSM, the firmware is still EFI.\nUltimately, the CSM creates more problems than it solves, at least on modern computers. Occasionally it's necessary, but as a general rule, my recommendation is to leave the CSM disabled. Enabling it (aka \"disabling UEFI mode\") may be what caused your problem in the first place -- or at least, it may have been a critical part of what caused the problem.\nBoth your GParted screen shot and the Boot Info Script output indicate that /dev/sda uses GPT. As such, Windows must be installed to the disk in EFI mode, and in fact the Boot Info Script output shows EFI-mode Windows boot loader files (or at least, files with appropriate filenames). The Boot Info Script output also, however, shows a BIOS-mode Windows boot loader on the disk. This boot loader would be useless on a GPT disk, though. My hunch is that EaseUS wrote that code to the MBR, but it might have been left over from a previous installation. In any event, it's possible that by activating the CSM, it ended up executing this useless boot code, which resulted in your failure to boot.\n\nA: You need to insert your Windows DVD and boot from it.

An incredible one.... \nIn the release notes of 15.10 beta, you can read:\n\nDue to changes in syslinux, it is not currently possible to use\n  usb-creator from 14.04 and earlier releases to write USB images for\n  15.04; we believe that it is also not possible to use usb-creator from a 15.04 system to write USB images for earlier releases. For now the\n  workaround is to use a matching release of Ubuntu to write the images,\n  but we intend to issue updates soon to work around this\n  incompatibility.\n\nSee the bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1325801\nSo it seems that, for the time being, you need 15.04 or later to build a bootable USB for 15.04 or later.

So for a week now I'm experiencing issues that distort the appearance on many programs such as Firefox while dayly use. Ultimately this causes most programs to crash.

It's an Acer with Win7.  I have  a 100G partition set aside for installing and running Ubuntu.  After download I just get a disk image file about 1G in size.  \"ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64\"  nothing runs it.  I'm sure I'm missing a step in the process.  I used to have an older version of Ubuntu loaded and sort of running but I uninstalled that one.\nWhat's going wrong?  Did I miss a step?  \n\nA: Yes, you need to reset your computer, change the boot to start looking the DVD content (press F9 or F2 at the beginning, it depends on the computer). That's all, ubuntu will load from the DVD and will allow you to install ubuntu. \nBe careful with new UEFI boot system. If your computer presents this system, you will need to deactivate to access the boot menu once you reset it. You have hundreds of web pages to learn how to deactivate UEFI system.\n\nA: As long as the image burned ok onto the dvd without errors then all you need to do to make it boot is change the bios setting's to boot the disk drive first..\nUsually you will need to restart the laptop and press F9 or F2 or Esc key to get into the bios, once there go to the boot order and moved the cd/disk drive up to the top then simply exit saving changes and restart the laptop.\n", "Q: Can't ssh to ec2 instance with secpanel I am trying to get my secpanel to work with my ec2 instance.

I've tried about every answer/solution/suggestion on askUbuntu for about 6-7+ hours now, describing connecting wireless interface to a wired NIC on the Ubuntu computer which will then connect to/serve a router's uplink.\nInternet access at this site is over a cell phone's wireless hotspot which really doesn't stink as much as it sounds like it would.\nEarlier a Windows machine was responsible for making connection to the cell phone hotspot, and a wired Ethernet NIC with static IP on the same Windows machine provided the Up/Downlink to a router.  This gave local devices both internet access plus LAN communications to one another, and as it turns out the wireless AP feature of the router covers a wider physical area than the little cell phone hotspot.\nAs folks noted elsewhere on askUbuntu, with Windows it was merely necessary to \"bridge\" (in Windows terminology which may vary from strict definitions) the wireless and wired interfaces.  In under a minute the Windows-host was handling traffic between the WAN side of the router and the wireless adapter which supplied internet access; it all worked swimmingly.\nSO, now I'm trying to replace the exact capability that was supplied by the Windows PC with the ubuntu 14.04 machine.  True, I'd also like to leverage the ubuntu 14.04 machine a bit more, making it participate in the LAN so it has access to printers and offers some of its RAID storage over Samba.\nSince we're talking about the same router, same wireless hot spot, and same server hardware (running ubuntu instead of Windows), I suspect there should be a correct software configuration available to do it.\n\nMy own attempts so far have failed.  I've approached this in many ways described such as: Network Manager with a bridge and assigned slaves; Network Manager with a connection marked as \"shared to other computers\" (which one person said would do some NATting); also tried setting up bridge in /etc/network/interfaces. \nGenerally in most of the approaches tried, I can reach the Router for administration over eth1 connection to the LOCAL side of the router.  The Router uplink to eth0 card connection looks good.   But as far as traffic flowing over the wireless adapter: nope.  Nada.  Perhaps I blew the configuration on every attempt.  Meanwhile for example the answer at Share Wireless connection with Wired Ethernet Port suggested something (similar) was about as easy as Windows was.  \nCould be because I have flu these past couple days but after 8 (or now 10??) hours on this subject I'm ready to ask for the recipe, especially one specific to 14.04 LTS.\nThanks.\n\nA: Since there is no short answer I recommend reading the Official Ubuntu Server guide, specifically on Networking and yes Bridging. Also, be aware of what your interfaces are actually named as they differ from the guides, versions, and answers on askubuntu.com. I've seen eth0, p2p1, and enp1s0 use this command to help start you out ifconfig -a. The guide below is from the server guide but it has excellent information which I commonly refer to. Good luck.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/network-configuration.html\n\nA: This is not an actual answer to your question but more of research help on finding the solution.  Some sort of what I would do after reaching this point untill someone with more knowledge on the topic comes in.\nNote that I am not an Ubuntu networking expert, but a self-taught user. \nSo, from what I understand after getting internet from the cell via  WiFi, \nyou want to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Share that WiFi connection to the router via a wired connection.  \n\n\nThere is a great answer at How to Connect & Share your Internet Connection (Wired & Wireless) that explains step by step on how to achieve the bridging of your WiFi to your Ethernet connections. It's not a way. It's THE way. \n\n\n*\n\n*After that, connecting the eth1 to the router everything will be handled by the router. In case you set up custom IP's, I think all of the devices must be set accordingly.\n\n\nNote that after a test that does't work out you must undo your changes, because your next test might not work due to a previous setting of a previous solution approach.\n", "Q: Upgrade directly from 14.04.3 to 15.04 I already have Ubuntu 14.04.3 and I want to go to 15.04. Do I need to fully install the new version or can I upgrade it from the existing version? \n\nA: Ubuntu wasn't designed to do that. You can upgrade to 14.10 and then 15.04, but that is a time-consuming process and there are a lot of things that can go wrong. If I were you, I'd back up everything on your system and install 15.04 fresh. However, I'd recommend waiting for October 22 when 15.10 comes out. After all, I doubt you want to deal with upgrading to 15.10 after you just installed 15.04.\n\nA: These instructions are actually impossible to go from 14.04.x to 15.04 because Canconical no longer supports 14.10, so you can't upgrade to that. These instructions will be kept in case in the next LTS, someone needs to upgrade to a non-LTS.\nI searched around, and this looks like it would work.\nUse your favorite editor, such as vim (or nano or vi or emacs, etc) to edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades (note you need to make sure you do this as root or use sudo to edit the file) and change this line:\nprompt=lts to prompt=normal.\nAfter doing this, reboot your computer and do sudo do-release-upgrade. You'll need to reboot your computer and sudo do-release-upgrade again.\nThere's also a way to do it for the GUI update manager, which is to open it and look around the settings until you find something mentioning LTS. It should be a dropdown box or radio switch or something like that with the options: \"LTS\" or \"any new versions\". At least, something along those lines. Again, you'd have to initiate the update again. I hope this helps you out!

Just recently reinstalled Ubuntu and every time I boot, I get thrown into the grub shell. I've looked everywhere, wasted a lot of time and can't track the problem for the life of me.\nThe partition table is laid out as:\n/dev/sda1 - The actual OS\n/dev/sda2 - EFI \n/dev/sda3 - Swap\nBy running:\nset root=(hd0,gpt1)\nlinux /vmlinuz_something root=/dev/sda1 ro\ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nI boot into the OS and then run update-grub. It appears as it has succesfully located the kernels updated the entries, but still boots into grub. So I further looked into the issue and ran into some instances suggesting it might have something to do with the way GRUB handles booting following unsuccesful boot attempts.\nFrom what I could make out of those, I decided to try and add to my /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=$GRUB_TIMEOUT\n\nI ran update-grub once more and the issue persisted. Also tried other values as a guess, which didn't work unsurprisingly. I apologize for  bringing up this exhausted topic, but the solutions I found just haven't worked for me. Any ideas on how to fix this? \n\nA: My suspicion is that you've got two GRUB installations -- maybe one for one distribution and another for another; or one BIOS-mode and one EFI-mode. In either case, if you're updating the configuration file for one GRUB but another one executes, you'll see symptoms like what you're seeing.\nIf you've got two EFI-mode GRUB installations, you should see evidence of them in your sudo efibootmgr -v output and/or in files on your EFI System Partition (ESP), which is normally mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu. Try the following commands:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\nsudo find /boot/efi -iname \"*.efi\"\n\nThe first shows boot loaders that are registered with the firmware, including their paths. If you see multiple references to shim.efi, shimx64.efi, grub.efi, or grubx64.efi (that is, more than one from this set), that could be the issue. The second command finds all the boot programs on your ESP (assuming it's mounted at /boot/efi). Again, multiple boot programs could be an issue -- but in this case, one Shim can coexist with one GRUB; it's just multiple GRUB binaries that could be a problem.\nIf you've got one BIOS-mode and one EFI-mode GRUB, that may be harder to detect. The easiest way to do so is to run the Boot Info Script, which identifies both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boot loaders, but takes some experience to interpret.\nYou may want to post the RESULTS.txt file that Boot Info Script produces, along with output of those two commands I noted, to a pastebin site, and post the URLs here for us to interpret.\nOne more thing: If you've got both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode GRUBs, and if the BIOS-mode GRUB is the one that's failing, you can bypass it by going into your firmware and disabling the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka \"legacy boot support\" or words to that effect. I give this action perhaps a 1 in 3 chance of fixing your problem, but it's worth trying, especially if you remember following instructions to enable your CSM. Even if this action doesn't fix the problem by itself, it may facilitate the solution, once the cause is better understood.\n", "Q: Best partition scheme for two ssd? I have two 256GB ssd drives, one is a Samsung 850 Evo on a mSATA port and the other is a Samsung 850 Pro on a SATA port. I expect the Evo is a bit slower than the Pro and is has half the lifetime expectancy (5 year vs 10 year warranty).\nSo what would be the best partition schema using these two drives for a personal desktop? \n\nA: First, I would install Ubuntu on Samsung 850 Evo. \nThen  using this guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving\nI'll move /home to Samsung 850 Pro. \nThis has the advantage that you'll have /home on a separated disk, so your data remain intact in case you need to reinstall the OS. Also you'll enjoy higher life expectancy of the Pro disk where you value more the data, at your home folder. \n", "Q: Cannot Open Camera In kdenlive Via IEEE1394 I am having difficulty getting a system to cooperate with a video camera using kdenlive and an IEEE1394 connection.\nFrom running lshw, we can see there is a card for such connections recognized:\n       *-firewire:0\n            description: FireWire (IEEE 1394)\n            product: VT6306/7/8 [Fire II(M)] IEEE 1394 OHCI Controller\n            vendor: VIA Technologies, Inc.\n            physical id: 6\n            bus info: pci@0000:04:06.0\n            version: 46\n            width: 32 bits\n            clock: 33MHz\n            capabilities: pm ohci bus_master cap_list\n            configuration: driver=firewire_ohci latency=32 maxlatency=32\n            resources: irq:20 memory:fe701000-fe7017ff ioport:c080(size=128)\n       *-firewire:1\n            description: FireWire (IEEE 1394)\n            product: VT6306/7/8 [Fire II(M)] IEEE 1394 OHCI Controller\n            vendor: VIA Technologies, Inc.\n            physical id: e\n            bus info: pci@0000:04:0e.0\n            version: c0\n            width: 32 bits\n            clock: 33MHz\n            capabilities: pm ohci bus_master cap_list\n            configuration: driver=firewire_ohci latency=32 maxlatency=32\n            resources: irq:22 memory:fe700000-fe7007ff ioport:c000(size=128)\n\nThe installed system is Ubuntu 15.04.

My question is how can I install these two packages alongside each other seeing as I use both.\n\nA: If that problem is occurring on Ubuntu, most likely it is because you have 32 bit version of mit-scheme.\nThe problem is with packages libpq5:i386 and libpq5.\npostgres depends on the latter and mit-scheme depends on the former package. So as soon as you install postgres, libpq5:i386 is removed to install libpq5. (Both x86 and x64 versions of libpq5 don't go together well, apparently.)

Alternatively, call the ISP and ask them if they have a real HOTSPOT network available and having experience with quite a few ISPs all over EMEA, that'll be an extra payable service...\n\nA: First of all, delete all the networks from /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections that you don't want to connect to.

I thought its permission problem so changed permission of /usr/share as following\nsudo chmod -R ugo=rwx /usr/share\n\nWithin few minits after this system started behaving strangely. \nThen it collapsed. Nothing was happening. Only black screen was there. \nSo, I forced shutdown but pushing power button and then restarted the system. It went well till BIOS screen, showed the colored Ubuntu letters and in seconds again went blank. \nWhat I tried?\nSo to solve this I first looked for answeres on \"black screen\" after BIOS. Almost all of them suggesting that there must be so problem with graphics card. I was not sure about it, so I tried to see if changes in permission has caused some problem. \nThis question has raise relatively similar issue. \nBut as system was down and there was no screen at all I was not knowing where to put the commands. Additionally it was different in two ways - it speaks about /usr/bin and not /usr/share and in my case sudo was working fine. \nIn this situation, with some research, I tried typing \"ctrl+alt+f1\" and now I was able to see tty1 type. I am root on this machine and as said earlier sudo was working fine. \nNow, I tried the combination of suggestions I found in above mentioned question and also here and here and here.  \nCommands like shutdown now or reboot or even sudo reboot were not working.

In away, its quite simple. As @Aizuddin Zali suggest the way out is through setting \"right\" permission for /usr/share again. But then, what is \"right permission\" (or say standard)? I tried to search for it without much help when I dashed on this question and its answer. Though it is not speaking directly about /usr/share I tried to use the same permissions and it worked!! I will try to explain this in detail.\nWhat I did (already discussed in question):\nAs I explain it in question, with the help of Karnel ( ctrl+alt+t ), I changed the permission of directory /usr/share. I did it with recursive command (R).\nWhat Happended:\nSystem collapsed.\nSolution which I found:\nI closed the PC forcefully by pressing and holding power key. Then I started it by pressing it again. As usual BIOS screen appeared. Colord UBUNTU letters also appeared for while and they diappeared. Then there was nothing. I pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1 . tty1 started. There I typed my login name (it was admin account) and then password. Now I changed the permission of /usr/share to drwxr-xr-x . The commands I used were\nFor knowing the current status:\n\nsudo ls -l /usr/share\n\nwhich gave me list of permissions in the directory. Then,\n\nsudo chmod -R u=rwx /usr/share\nsudo chmod -R go-w /usr/share\n\n(Which restricted the permission to \"write\" for g(group) and o(other).)\n\nsudo chmod -R go=rx /usr/share\n\nNow the output of\n\nsudo ls -l /usr/share\n\nwas\n\ndrwxr-wr-w\n\nThen,\n\nsudo reboot\n\nThe pc heard this. (Pc was not hearing reboot or \"shutdown now\" commands previously even as sudo) And then it stared, loggin screen appeared too.\nHopefully, whatever I did was right!

But for a Bachelor Project at my university, I was advised to use Linux in combination with computations in statistical physics. I want to have a dual-boot Windows 8 and Linux.\nBefore installing, I read a lot of warnings and tips. I followed them (disabling Secure Boot in Windows 8, disabling Fast Boot). Then I made a partition to use for Linux Mint 17.2 Mate, and a swap partition. I installed it, and everything worked fine. But when turning on my computer, the grub screen didn't appear. After a day's work, I had installed Xubuntu instead of Mint and did a few Boot Repairs, and disabled the 'Secure boot' option in the Boot Repair Advanced options. After that, I could use Xubuntu without problems, also after rebooting. But I liked Mint better, so yesterday I tried to install Mint the same way as I did Xubuntu. But at the 'installing the grub2 package', the installation aborted with the error:\n\nthe grub-efi-amd64-signed package failed to install into /target/.\n\nMy guess is that I have made a mistake in the location of the bootloader, before the installation process. I installed (and later removed) Xubuntu, and with Xubuntu I installed the bootloader in /dev/sda2, where also the Windows boot manager is located. Before that, when installing Xubuntu another time, I installed the bootloader in a separate /boot partition /dev/sda8. Finally, another time I also installed the bootloader in /dev/sda. It was really a trial-and-error fixing the problem that no grub screen appeared at the beginning.\nMy guess is that now, those bootloaders that I've installed with Xubuntu on sda, sda2 and sda8 cause problems for the grub2 package with Mint to install.\nI've already looked at many pages about the same issue, but none worked. I have a Internet connection and the 'extra 64' is present (see Ubuntu 12.04 --- grub-efi-amd64-signed failed to install into /target/).\nWhat can I do? Any tips from experienced users? Or should I try another distro? Thanks in advance! Greetings from Holland.\n\nA: HPs are notorious for forgetting their boot loader information, and there's even evidence supporting this hypothesis in your Boot Repair output; for instance:\nchroot /mnt/boot-sav/sda5 efibootmgr -v\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nNo BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery\n\nNote that last line, which means that the computer will try to boot the fallback boot loader -- EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. (Some EFIs will actually fall back to the Windows boot loader in this situation -- EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.)\nThis is defective firmware. You might be able to get a fix from HP, but that's unlikely. If the computer is new enough, I'd return it to the store for a refund; but your mention of Windows 8 makes me think you're past that point.\nThis leaves you with two options, assuming you really need a dual boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the fallback boot loaders (both the ones I mentioned earlier) and put copies of GRUB (or some other boot loader or boot manager) in their place. This is a flaky and ugly hack of a workaround, not a fix; but it's the easiest way to get results. Boot Repair has an option to do this automatically. It's called something like \"back up and replace boot loaders\" (I don't recall the exact phrasing) on its Advanced menu.\n\n*Wipe the disk clean and do a fresh install of both Windows and Ubuntu, but do so in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode rather than in EFI/UEFI mode. Forcing the boot mode may be a bit tricky, though; you'll need to figure out how to do it with your specific firmware implementation, since there's no standardization of how to do this. A variant of this approach is to convert both your OSes to boot in BIOS mode, but that's likely to be more tedious than re-installing. You'd probably want do this only if you've spent a lot of time customizing your installation and have lots of data files -- but an in-place conversion risks data loss, so you'd need to back up for safety anyhow, and at that point a re-installation starts to look pretty reasonable.\n\n", "Q: Install Plasma 5 KDE ubuntu - Cannot add PPA I am trying to install Plasma 5 KDE on my ubuntu 14.04 with the following commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/next-backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-plasma5-desktop plasma-workspace-wallpapers\n\nIt fails after the first command with the message:\n Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:kubuntu-ppa/next-backports'.\nPlease check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n\nI got all from the following link\nhttp://sourcedigit.com/14871-install-kde-plasma-5-2-ubuntu-14-04-ubuntu-14-10/\nWhat is this error-message and how do I solve it?\n\nA: ppa:kubuntu-ppa/next-backports is a valid name for a PPA, but there is no PPA with this name.

I was instructed to open the terminal and cut and paste this text, sudo apt-get install libdvdread4, followed by, sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh, this has fixed the errors and now the DVD's play as the software installed decryption information to allow this.\n", "Q: Nvidia CUDA, Hybrid Graphics, optirun vglrun, deviceQuery Permission denied Intro\nI am trying to get CUDA working on my hybrid graphics laptop. I am using (l)ubuntu 15.04.\nCurrently I have followed some steps in an online guide, which I shall explain below, and I am able to run optirun glxspheres64 without problems. However when I run optirun ./deviceQuery I get the following error:\n/usr/bin/vglrun: 246: exec: ./deviceQuery: Permission denied\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any info about this online.\nDetail\nThe guide I followed is here. I didn't follow all the steps exactly as this is now quite old and Nvidia have changed the format in which they ship their .run files.\nI did the following: (This is straight out of my history command.)\n15  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n16  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n17  sudo apt-get update \n18  sudo apt-get install bumblebee\n19  sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia \n20  sudo reboot\n\nThen log into tty1, stop the x server and init 3.\n21  cd Downloads/\n22  chmod +x cuda_7.5.18_linux.run \n23  sudo ./cuda_7.5.18_linux.run\n\nInstall the run package with all default options, also install the graphics driver version 352.\nThen set up the PATH variable.\n25  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n26  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n27  sudo ldconfig\n\nI skipped the next static linking steps. I didn't get any linker errors (or at least I don't think I did) when compiling the sample codes, so I presume this wasn't required. I also haven't seen this step in any other guides online. Perhaps this is where I went wrong?\nThen some stuff obviously requires OpenGL, so:\n28  sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev\n\nCompile the samples:\n30  cd NVIDIA_CUDA-7.5_Samples/\n31  make\n\nThen I attempted to run ./deviceQuery, which is inside the Utilities directory. I got an error which I have previously seen before about bumblebeed not running.\nSo:\n34  sudo vim /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf \n\nChange the line with Driver= (which was blank) to Driver=nvidia, and also the line KernelDriver=nvidia-current to KernelDriver=nvidia.\nThis info is available here, see the (currently) second answer to the question.\nIt still wasn't working, so I tried following the info given in the first answer to be above linked question and installed the kernel headers:\n48  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic \n49  sudo reboot\n\nIf I do:\n54  sudo service bumblebeed status\n\nI now get:\n● bumblebeed.service - Bumblebee C Daemon\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/bumblebeed.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Sun 2015-10-11 13:15:07 BST; 20min ago\n Main PID: 1502 (bumblebeed)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/bumblebeed.service\n           └─1502 /usr/sbin/bumblebeed\n\nOct 11 13:16:20 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  163.019954] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:16:20 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  163.019987] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:16:20 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  163.020055] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:17:11 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: rmmod: ERROR: Module nvidia...d\nOct 11 13:17:11 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: modprobe: FATAL: Error runn...a\nOct 11 13:17:22 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  225.439546] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:17:22 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  225.439578] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:17:22 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: [  225.439606] [WARN][XORG]....\nOct 11 13:17:23 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: rmmod: ERROR: Module nvidia...d\nOct 11 13:17:23 P151EMx bumblebeed[1502]: modprobe: FATAL: Error runn...a\nHint: Some lines were ellipsized, use -l to show in full.\n\nBut it looks like I still have some problems here...

Perhaps try installing the driver after CUDA to avoid this step? It seems a bit unnecessary to install driver version 352 and then revert to 304 by doing the following:\nI noticed that on the linked question, the command sudo apt-get install -reinstall nvidia-current was appended after installing the kernel headers.\nI ran this command, I think my driver has gone back to version 304.

E.g.\n\\begin{displaymath}\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} q^{-n}=\\frac{1}{1-q}\n\\end{displaymath}\n\nInline math uses that wierd position for the indices in order to avoid stretching the spacing between subsequent lines.

The first time I tried to install ubuntu on the system, a GRUB installation error occurred, probably due Fastboot(I couldn't Secureboot option in my BIOS or anywhere). On the second attempt, everything went well and the installation succeeded, system restarted. But it did not reboot into ubuntu, there was no GRUB on startup and no ubuntu bootloader in boot menu. I intended to apply some repairs using LiveUSB, but I couldn't log into my installation, it rather entered into a fresh Try Ubuntu session. Also my system just won't boot Ubuntu LiveUSB in UEFI mode. So the BootRepair doesn't work either. I can't figure out any fix, inability to log into the system also prevents any repairs.\n\nA: You say that you've been unable to boot the installer in EFI mode. This means that your installation must have been in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, which in turn means that you almost certainly have a mixed-mode (BIOS/EFI) installation (Linux in BIOS mode, Windows in EFI mode). This is a recipe for hair loss.\nUltimately, your best bet is to get the Ubuntu installer booting in EFI mode. If it won't boot at all -- that is, if you don't even see GRUB appear -- then chances are your USB drive was prepared with a tool that doesn't know how to create an EFI-bootable disk. Try another tool. Most people find that Rufus works well from Windows, although there are other options. Once you get this working, you can either re-install or run Boot Repair from the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode.\nAlternatively, you could try installing my rEFInd boot manager from Windows. You'll also need to install an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your kernel (ext4fs by default). This will be difficult to do if Secure Boot is active, though, since there's no setup script for Windows and the Secure Boot installation procedure is more complex. If you can do this, though, rEFInd will become your boot manager, bypassing GRUB.\n", "Q: Error in terminal I am trying to install chrome in the terminal and this is the error that appears when i try to install it:\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nWhat can i do to fix this?\n\nA: This type of error occur when we install package with different package manager parallel then it will show that resource is not available \nor \nIt might be sometime we abort some installation process and that process still running. in that case we have either kill that PID or reboot system . but sometime we can't reboot system so killing process PID is the good way.\ncheck PID using command :\n    ps -ef | grep dpkg \nroot      4177  3910  0 20:51 pts/3    00:00:00 sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nuser      4222  4069  0 20:52 pts/9    00:00:00 grep --color=auto dpkg\n\nso kill PID 4177  using command \nsudo kill 4177\n\n", "Q: how to browse securely from behind home router using openssh? i have seen a lot of explanations on setting up a ssh tunnel from work to home and vice versa. i am trying to do something hopefully a bit easier. i have an old macbook pro running 14.04 as a single boot system. i have loaded openssh server on it and i am just trying to use it to browse securely with firefox. do i have to have a machine on either side of the ISP router for this to happen? i work remote. therefore my 'work' office is also behind the ISP router. lots of ssh setup details on the net, just nothing like this. thank you for any advice.  \n\nA: There will be always someone looking at your traffic (unless you will use tor). If it will not be your home ISP, it will be your work ISP or IPS for your server in some server-housing company. It is mostly statistical information about traffic to optimize the links, but they can also search for patterns, for example copyrighted content.\nYou can encrypt point-to-point communication to prevent this happening using ssh and for example SOCKS proxy, but when you will leave this link, you will get to the internet and it can be only on different place. Later on internet you will need to use something that servers support and it is usually HTTPS (there is a plugin that tries to enforce it, called HTTPS Everywhere)\n\nA: Assuming that your home computer is accessible from the internet (you have an external, real IP) and you want to use SSH to tunnel all your connections from office, there is a brief list of to-do's.\nIn brief:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a port forwarding entry (NAT) on your router to the computer that will run OpenSSH inside your home network. (from 0.0.0.0:22 to  serverip:22)\n\n*Setup OpenSSH server on your computer. Configure it by editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Make sure you restart server to apply changes using sudo service sshd restart\n\n*When you see that your SSH is running (run sudo netstat -nlp | grep 22 you should see an entry), check that the port forwarding works from the outside using, i.e service such as ping.eu.\n\n*Run a SSH session from work to home. You have to open a local dynamic port (ssh -D option): ssh -D 65530 john@home. See man ssh for details.\n\n*Setup your browser (or any other application) to use localhost:65530 as proxy for connections.\n\n*There you go.\n\nA: No need for any of the command line stuff. Easy solution. Pulled an old Galaxy 3 android out of the drawer with no sim. Plugged it in. It's the server. Downloaded android ssh server. Much easier setup than open ssh. Works beautifully. \n", "Q: Various ways to set up proxy? I am using gnome-classic on Ubuntu 14.04.

I need an application I can use to compress pictures without losing the quality.\nI've heard about Trimage and GIMP. \n\nA: png is the way to go. In very specific cases, you get a better lossless compression by saving the file as a bmp and then compressing it using 7zip, but this makes it impossible to view them with normal image viewer software or to edit them with normal image editing software.\nYou will still be able to save a tiny, tiny amount of storage space by compressing png images with 7zip, but it's not worth the unacceptability that comes with it.\nIf you first use a lossy compression (like jpeg) and then a lossless compression (like png), not only will you have the same quality like the jpeg image (which lost quality in respect to the original image) and use more storage space than the jpeg image, the use of storage space will also be higher than if you took the original image directly and converted it to png. This is generally true, even for using the same lossy compression over and over again: If you do so, not only will the quality (of course) decrease every single time, you also will use more and more storage space. So make sure to convert the original image to png, not images which are currently stored as jpegs. Do, however, store images which used to be stored as jpegs as png, after you edited them, to avoid further loss of quality and making the storage space use when eventually saving them as pngs even worse.\nYou convert a lot of images to png using the command\nmogrify -format png /your/path/*.jpg   \n\nor\nmogrify -format png /your/path/*.jpeg \n\ndepending on which file extension the images have.\nIf you want to move the converted images somewhere else, use\nmv /original/path/*.png /new/path\n\n, and if you want to just delete the old ones, use\nrm /your/path/*.jpg\n\nor\nrm /your/path/*.jpeg\n\nYou will be able to store individual images as pngs in about every graphics program (like gimp).\n", "Q: What's the difference between Ubuntu GNOME and Ubuntu Unity with GNOME Shell installed from Ubuntu Software manager? I'm new to Ubuntu. Last night I installed GNOME Shell from the Ubuntu software manager. I really like this desktop environment. What the difference between doing this and installing Ubuntu GNOME? Would it be better if I downloaded Ubuntu GNOME instead of using the GNOME shell in place of Unity?\nAlso, if I get Ubuntu GNOME will the command lines used in terminal be different? I'm very new to Ubuntu so I don't want to start learning new command lines right now. For example, to install something it would still be sudo apt-get install PackageName correct?\nDo different ubuntu flavours use different command lines in Terminal? Ubuntu different from Lubuntu different from Kubuntu, different from Ubuntu Gnome?\n\nA: Ubuntu GNOME comes with a different set of applications from Ubuntu with Unity, although some are the same. So that meas the only difference between installing regular Ubuntu first and then installing Gnome Shell, versus installing Ubuntu Gnome, is that you don't get the same applications. Although if you install the ubuntu-gnome-desktop package (I assume you installed gnome-shell), you will get the applications that come with Ubuntu Gnome.\n", "Q: Apache logs deleted I just tried to delete log files of apache since i am learning to use apachetop and need clear log files.\nI ran a command sudo rm -rf /var/log/apache2/* and now there is no apache2 folder inside log folder.\nI tried access some localhost sites to see if its generated automatically but it is not.\nNow my apachetop is not running and it says\nopening /var/log/apache/access.log: No such file or directory\nHow will i get back my log files ?\nThanks\n\nA: This will not answer the question of how to get your log files back, but instead help you get apachetop running again.\nHave you tried restarting the apache server?  Have you tried accessing the site?  The later of these two suggestions is sure to populate the access.log file with an entry.\nI'm a bit confused because you've described two different log directories, but if you're still having issues:\nsudo mkdir /var/log/apache/\nsudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/\nsudo touch /var/log/apache/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log\n\nYou may need to give the apache user read and write access to the files:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/apache\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/apache2\n\n\nIn the future, do not use rm since the software that uses that log expects it to exist.

I've tried both, and both clear the disk and all its data. So what exactly is the difference? What is the point of using the second one, as it takes SO much longer? \n\nA: When not overwriting existing data, the file tables are cleared and all of the diskspace is opened up for future writing.  The data is still there, but won't be seen by the new filesystem.  The old data will become corrupted and overwritten over time.  This is typically faster, and fine for a normal user.\nWhen overwriting existing data, every bit of the device is written over with a zero.  This is preferred when the contents of the disk were confidential, or the drive is being given to another person.  In this way, the data is more securely destroyed (not entirely) and would be much, much harder to get off the disk.\n", "Q: How to speed up `apt-get upgrade`?

When installing Ubuntu, I don't want to format the partition that is going to be /. Installation wizard prompts me that Directories containing system files (/etc, /lib, /usr, /var...) that already exist will be deleted. Can somebody list all of them? Does it include /home?\n\nA: Most directories contain 'system files', except those in /home/.  However, since you say your home directory is on the same partition, you would lose that data if you were to proceed.\nWhen installing Ubuntu, you are given the option of having one partition for all directories, or mounting different partitions for specific directories.\nOne setup may have /, /bin, /home, etc on one partition, while another setup may have /, /bin, etc on a partition, with /home on another partition.  The benefit of the second setup is that you can re-install linux root (/) without touching your home directory (/home).\nHowever, since you have the first setup, in this situation, you would be deleting all of the data on that partition, which includes your home directory.\nIf you have a LiveCD, you can mount your drive and move any data onto another HDD.  When installing Ubuntu, be sure to use the second setup to prevent this in the future.  Another option would be to place your HDD into another Linux machine, mount the HDD, and pull off the data.\nExample:\nI have an SSD (/dev/sda) and HDD (/dev/sdb).  When I install Ubuntu, I select to create an ext4 partition on all of the SDD.  I also create an ext4 partition on the HDD.  I then tell Ubuntu to use the SSD as the root (/) partition, and tell it to use the HDD as the home (/home) partition.\nTomorrow I accidentally run a bad command that I will not place here (let's say I just removed all the files in /bin/).  I can then load up an Ubuntu CD, format the SSD (/dev/sda1) partition, point to my HDD for home (without formatting).  After it installs, I will be on a fresh Ubuntu install with all of my home data.\n", "Q: Libgnomecanvas error when installing Ardour on Lubuntu. Gnome conflicting with LXDE?

Make sure swap isn't used either (if you have a swap partition) by right-clicking it and choosing \"swap off\".\nThen resize your partitions as you choose. Resizing from the right hand side of a partition is generally fast, resizing from the left and moving a partition is generally slow. There is a program called \"Disks\" which you can open from the dash. It comes with a benachmark tool for drives. Make sure only to perform a read benchmark. Use the mean value and approximate the data which has to be copied. This gives you a rough estimate of how long it's going to take.\nKeep in mind that playing with partitions is dangerous, especially if there is a power failure, so make sure to have a backup. If you have to make one in advance, use the mean value from the bench mark for an estimate and the tool dd do make the backup. The estimate for this one should be pretty accurate if you're using an external hard drive with usb 3.0 for the backup. If yours is usb 2.0, it'll take a lot longer. 30 MB/s as an estimate.\n", "Q: Docker on Ubuntu 14.04.3 always getting \"[8] System error: no such file or directory\" I had Docker working three weeks ago, but now I can't get anything except \nno such file or directory\nError response from daemon: Cannot start container 7d3cb483971037da163fd8d220100728f51e055e7d0ae811a70bf2ef32564552: [8] System error: no such file or directory\n\nI am going batty trying to get this to work.\ndocker version:\nClient:\n Version:      1.8.2\n API version:  1.20\n Go version:   go1.4.2\n Git commit:   0a8c2e3\n Built:        Wed Oct  7 17:48:28 UTC 2015\n OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\n\nServer:\n Version:      1.8.2\n API version:  1.20\n Go version:   go1.4.2\n Git commit:   0a8c2e3\n Built:        Wed Oct  7 17:48:28 UTC 2015\n OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\n\ndocker info:\nContainers: 1\nImages: 2\nStorage Driver: aufs\n Root Dir: /var/lib/docker/aufs\n Backing Filesystem: extfs\n Dirs: 4\n Dirperm1 Supported: false\nExecution Driver: native-0.2\nLogging Driver: json-file\nKernel Version: 3.13.0-66-generic\nOperating System: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nCPUs: 4\nTotal Memory: 7.74 GiB\nName: footscray\nID: IWMM:MCLX:3H5C:V4QA:JQA2:TVBM:F3PX:4VC4:45XZ:C6AT:TB75:QQNG\n\nOutput of uname -a:\nLinux footscray 3.13.0-66-generic #108-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 7 15:20:27 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI am running on localhost.\nOutput of docker run hello-world:\nUnable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from library/hello-world\n\n535020c3e8ad: Pull complete \naf340544ed62: Pull complete \nDigest: sha256:a68868bfe696c00866942e8f5ca39e3e31b79c1e50feaee4ce5e28df2f051d5c\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest\nno such file or directory\nError response from daemon: Cannot start container b834de00b11decea01b36d1105352eca423bf708dda4b14016bab8fecd5bff41: [8] System error: no such file or directory\n\nAt first I'd used the wget method to install docker, but then I removed everything and used the method described in the documentation.\nI've installed app-armour and made adjustments accordingly.\n\nA: I have solved this issue - it's worth noting that my docker and AppArmor skills are rudimentary, so I'm not 100% sure of what's going on here.\nWhen I first applied the AppArmor solution (aa-complain, per session) it worked.

From it's man page:\n-l, --count-links\n          count sizes many times if hard linked\n\nIn other words, unless you pass the -l flag, you won't count sizes for hard linked files in both locations.\nTo try to address your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're hard linking between www and test.

You can use your Ubuntu install disk (gparted) to check the available partitions and usage of your hard drive.  Normally having just one OS (operating system), you may have just one big partition in use.\nYou see a reference in your research to shrinking or making a new partition for a new OS installation.\nWill gparted you can find the largest partition and shrink it.  Then you'll have unpartitioned space of which you can partition for Ubuntu.  Make it an ext4 partition.  You'll also need a swap partition.  I would recommend a swap partition at least the size, of the amount of ram you have in your computer.  In fact you'd best have a swap partition twice the size of your computer's ram.\nSo after shrinking your current partition and making space for your Ubuntu installation (at least 50 gigs) and your swap partition (at least 4 gigs). proceed with the install.\nDuring the install, choose \"Something else\".  Then specify the new ext4 partition you created for your install.  It won't touch your other OS partitions.\nWhen the install finishes you'll have a menu of either booting to Windows or Ubuntu with Ubuntu being the default.\n\nA: You can always use a flash drive.

Then Browser opens your whatsapp in itself. \n Nothing to install . Easy\n\nA: I think the best alternative today is to use whatsapp-linux which is an Electron wrapper for WhatsApp's web: https://web.whatsapp.com/\nYou can find the latest version in the Release section of GitHub: https://github.com/cstayyab/whatsapp-linux/releases\nIt comes handily packed as an AppImage, so it's as easy as downloading, changing the execution permissions of the file and running it.\n\nA: This is an old question but now I need to use WhatsApp in my Ubuntu environment, and I found this solution based on a third-party WhatsApp Linux Client called Whatsie. This client works for Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Linux Mint 18. Whatsie is a simple but helpful wrapper for WhatsApp Web, available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.\nHow to install Install Whatsie?\nThe recommended way to install it is through the latest deb package.\nUbuntu, Debian 8+\n\n\n*\n\n*Download whatsie-x.x.x-linux-arch.deb\n\n*Double click and install, or run this command in the terminal:\ndpkg -i whatsie-x.x.x-linux-arch.deb\n\n*Start the app with your app launcher or by running whatsie in a terminal\nYou can also use apt\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window, then download the gpg key to make sure the deb you download is correct:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv 6DDA23616E3FE905FFDA152AE61DA9241537994D \n\n\n*Add the author’s repository to your sources list by running the following command. :\necho \"deb https://dl.bintray.com/aluxian/deb stable main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whatsie.list\n\nReplace stable if you want to pick another channel like beta or dev (pick stable if you're unsure).\n\n*Finally, update local package index and install Whatsie:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install whatsie\n\nOnce installed, you can start Whatsie from Unity Dash or Application Menu.\n\nA: WhatsApp Web Application\nOn GNOME/Ubuntu Desktop without installing any additional software\n\nThe Web Application feature of Gnome Web (formerly known as epiphany-browser) can be used to create your personal container for WhatsApp.\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic icon generation\n\n*Separate container, window, app\n\n*Always up-to-date via package-manager\n\n\nSteps to configure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gnome Web and go to http://web.whatsapp.com\n\n*Select 'Install Site as Web Application' from the burger menu\n\n*Name the app as you like e.g. WhatsAppWeb or Whatsie\n\n\nI recommend to log out from all devices, then open the created desktop app.\n\n\n\n*Finally scan the QR code.\n\n\nRemove WebApp:\nType about:applications in GNOME Web address bar to manage/remove Web Appliactions\nDetails:\nBy habit, mine is called \"Whatsie\" and the process creates the file ~/.local/share/applications/epiphany-whatsie-eeb...321.desktop\nOfficial website: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/\nOfficial instructions: https://help.gnome.org/users/epiphany/stable/browse-webapps.html.en\nPlease, be careful installing apps from sources you don't trust!\n\nA: Some people face the problem that the App shows you some browsers you should install instead of working correctly. If that happens to you, this is the fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once logged in, go to:\n/.config/UnofficialWhatsApp/\"Application Cache\"\n\n\n*Close the app\n\n*Remove index file\n\n*Change permission for Application Cache to make it inaccessible\nsudo chmod 000 \"Application Cache\"\n\nReference\n\nA: I used Applicationize.me to install WhatsApp web (and other web apps) as a Chrome apps.\nJust enter the URL http://web.whatsapp.com/ into the field, and it will create a downloadable extension that you can drag to Chrome's extension window (chrome://extensions/).\nYou can find the newly installed app on Ubuntu's app launcher.\n", "Q: unable to set permissions to nfs shared sub folder I have a common nfs folder under which i have many folders which needs to be accessed by particular users. how can i set subfolder permissions?? \nwe create these folders from Linux and users access it from windows\nnew to Linux please bear with me :D\n\nA: This might work:\nchmod -R ug+rw foldername\n\nthe -R means recursive.

Generic USB joystick\" I have two joysticks.\nBoth of them are detected in Ubuntu as \"DragonRise Inc. Generic USB Joystick\".\nAnd their second axis (the right stick) is detected as part of the first axis, and works erratically. Also some applications, such as some emulators fail to detect them in any way. \nOne is a 3GC SteelSeries Rumble Controller, and the other one is generic.\nI don't know what to do, as I need them for my job.\n\nA: My understanding is that there are driver issues, further work may need to be done reverse engineering the devices, they have never worked 100% and recently got worse.\nThere have been no developments for the drivers for many years, but there are a few mentions of this problem in 2015 (Youtube, Debian bug) so perhaps Steam is helping draw attention to these devices.\nI found jstest-gtk a nice utility when checking these things out, my experiences with Xbox compatible controllers is very good, but I'm looking for a more PSX style one myself.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I found a solution. The app jstest-gtk allows you to check the inputs of your controller. I strongly suggest anyone who has this problem download it to check how your device is working.\nIn the case of this particular joystick (mine is also a dragonrise inc), the horizontal movement of the first stick activates two different axis: Axis 0 and Axis 2. While the vertical movement of the second stick also activates two axis: Axis 2 and Axis 4. As you can see, both sticks are activating Axis 2. Most likely, the software you're trying to connect to is recognizing axis 2 rather than 0 and 4. In that case, you can go to the configurations of that particular software and change the axis it's using.\nIn my case, it was Dolphin. In the configuration screen of the controller I was able to manually change 'Axis 2' to Axis 0 and 4.\n", "Q: Grub not listing windows partition I have a windows partition on my ubuntu 14.04 but I've not used it in a while and have now noticed I can't see it in the grub boot loader. \nI've tried sudo fdisk -l and get the output\nDisk /dev/sda: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x4eb6e04c\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63   212700599   106350268+   b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sda2       212701184   391024639    89161728   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda3       391026686  1953523711   781248513    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5      1919977472  1953523711    16773120   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6       391026688  1919977471   764475392   83  Linux\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nI tried upgrading grub but it made no difference.\nI've also tried boot repair with the output file\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/12717023/\nIt also returns:\n\nThe boot files of [The OS now in use - Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS] are far from the start of the disk.

I need to access it no so if you can advise how I can get it back on grub boot options that'd be excellent.\nThanks\n\nA: What version of Windows do you believe is installed on the disk? The only place that Windows could be installed is in /dev/sda1, which is FAT; but IIRC, the last version of Windows that supported FAT installation was XP, and I seem to recall that installing XP on FAT required some extra hoop-jumping. Furthermore, the Boot Info Script output you've provided shows no evidence of Windows on that FAT partition -- but that could be a Boot Info Script limitation. Modern versions of Windows all install to NTFS, not to FAT.\nI also note that your /dev/sda2 is marked as being swap, but Boot Info Script couldn't identify its filesystem type. You also have another swap partition (/dev/sda5), so /dev/sda2 is a bit of a mystery. It's possible that Windows was on /dev/sda2, but somewhere along the line you accidentally changed its type code and overwrite at least part of it with 0s or random data, which would explain its current state. If so, it may be difficult or impossible to recover it. If you were to attempt it, though, I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a low-level backup of /dev/sda2, as in sudo dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/path/to/lots/of/free/space/sda2-backup.img bs=4096. (The partition is 42.5GiB in size, so you'll need at least that much free space somewhere.)\n\n*Use fdisk to change the type code of /dev/sda2 from 0x83 to 0x07. You use the t option in fdisk to change the type code, then save your changes with w.\n\n*Use CHKDSK in a Windows emergency disk on /dev/sda2 (which will of course be called something else -- perhaps C: -- in Windows).\n\n\nIf that doesn't help, it's conceivable that a third-party tool will be able to recover data. There's also a slim chance that TestDisk will be able to recover a Windows partition. As there's no unused space on your disk, that partition might be covered by /dev/sda2, so you might have to delete it for TestDisk to do its thing (or maybe TestDisk can delete /dev/sda2 for you if it finds something else there).\nIf you mainly just want to recover personal files, you may have better luck with PhotoRec, which can recover files from badly damaged filesystems. The last time I checked, PhotoRec did a poor job of recovering filenames. I've heard there are some Windows tools that can do a better job with preserving filenames, but I don't have names or URLs. You might want to ask about this on a Windows forum.\nIf you simply want to get Windows booting again but have no personal data to recover, re-installing it to /dev/sda2 may be the best option. To do this, you should change its type code to 0x07 (as described earlier). I'd also use mkfs.ntfs or GParted to create a fresh filesystem (NTFS) on that partition. After you re-install Windows, you'll need to restore GRUB in any of many ways that are well-documented (but I don't happen to have a URL handy).\n", "Q: remove mdadm raid1 without loosing data I have 2 hdd's in raid1 using mdadm.\nNow i want to completely disable raid but i want to keep data on disk 1, and use disk 2 separately\nIs there a way to do this.\nIll be honest, i know what raid is, but i have no idea how it is handled by mdadm.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04\nConfiguration:  \nmdadm: /dev/md does not appear to be an md device\n/dev/md0:\n        Version : 1.2\n  Creation Time : Tue Jul  7 10:13:17 2015\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 16768896 (15.99 GiB 17.17 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 16768896 (15.99 GiB 17.17 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Sun Oct 11 15:50:16 2015\n          State : clean \n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           Name : rescue:0\n           UUID : ec52104c:85983ebd:8a13b660:706bae89\n         Events : 32\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        1        0      active sync   /dev/sda1\n       1       8       17        1      active sync   /dev/sdb1\n/dev/md1:\n        Version : 1.2\n  Creation Time : Tue Jul  7 10:13:20 2015\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 523968 (511.77 MiB 536.54 MB)\n  Used Dev Size : 523968 (511.77 MiB 536.54 MB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Sat Sep 19 12:41:03 2015\n          State : clean \n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           Name : rescue:1\n           UUID : decb590d:aac47b81:568a2afa:3dee7600\n         Events : 30\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        2        0      active sync   /dev/sda2\n       1       8       18        1      active sync   /dev/sdb2\n/dev/md2:\n        Version : 1.2\n  Creation Time : Tue Jul  7 10:13:20 2015\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 1073610560 (1023.87 GiB 1099.38 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 1073610560 (1023.87 GiB 1099.38 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Mon Oct 12 09:25:14 2015\n          State : clean \n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           Name : rescue:2\n           UUID : 1daa4480:ddf3f359:575a1f97:e232bbdd\n         Events : 195\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        3        0      active sync   /dev/sda3\n       1       8       19        1      active sync   /dev/sdb3\n/dev/md3:\n        Version : 1.2\n  Creation Time : Tue Jul  7 10:13:20 2015\n     Raid Level : raid1\n     Array Size : 1839089920 (1753.89 GiB 1883.23 GB)\n  Used Dev Size : 1839089920 (1753.89 GiB 1883.23 GB)\n   Raid Devices : 2\n  Total Devices : 2\n    Persistence : Superblock is persistent\n\n    Update Time : Mon Oct 12 09:04:16 2015\n          State : clean \n Active Devices : 2\nWorking Devices : 2\n Failed Devices : 0\n  Spare Devices : 0\n\n           Name : rescue:3\n           UUID : 051aac4e:ecac8794:538fe663:c9212747\n         Events : 92\n\n    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State\n       0       8        4        0      active sync   /dev/sda4\n       1       8       20        1      active sync   /dev/sdb4  \n\n.\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'!
