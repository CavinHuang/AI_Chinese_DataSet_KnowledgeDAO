["Q: How to make continuity and handoff working [iPhone 5S; iOS 8.1][Macbook pro mid 2012] I could not find proper steps to use both continuity and handoff with voice calls. I managed to do the following till now and I was able to make calls from Macbook but not receive calls that came to my iPhone. Here are the steps I did,\nIn Macbook pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabled the \"Allow handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\"\nin Settings->General. \n\n*I ensured both my Mac and iPhone are using the\nsame iCloud account.\n\n\nIn iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings->FaceTime, I have enabled 'iPhone Cellar Calls'.\n\n*Settings->General, I have enabled Handoff & suggested apps\n\n\nI tried to pair iPhone bluetooth and my MBP. But I am unable to do so. I could see my iPhone in the list of devices in MBP, but when I pair, I get the message 'Make sure network access is enabled'.\nWhat else I should do to get continuity and handoff to work? If I am correct I should be able to,\n\n\n*\n\n*Make calls from Mac [Possible as of now]\n\n*Receive calls that I get form iPhone in Mac Use\n\n\nDevice Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5S Gold, AT&T. iOS 8.1 (12B411)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012). OS X 10.10 (14A389)\n\n\nI am unable to get the below feature working, [Receive calls]\n\nUnable to pair iPhone,\n\nUnable to send text messages,\n\n\nA: In your iPhone, go to Settings > General > Handoff & suggested apps and make sure Handoff is enabled.\n\nA: These troubleshooting steps helped me resolve this on one account:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete all pairing records in BlueTooth (Or at least all iOS pairing records) and then power down the Mac. \n\n*disable the setting to disable \"iPhone Cellular Calls\" in the FaceTime part of the settings app. \n\n*power down the iPhone 5 and start it back up. Don't launch any apps on the phone other than the settings app to enable \"iPhone Cellular Calls\"\n\n*Start up your Mac and log in if needed.\n\n\nTry a call or two. The delay for me is between 1 and 4 rings of the phone in general for the first call of the day. Things seem to notify me on my iPad before my Mac so if you have one of those, you could test handoff with it as well in case it's just your Mac that's not receiving the call notification.\nIf the above steps don't resolve your issue, you might have to set the date/time correctly on the Mac (to within 2 minutes of the iPhone's time - both to sync automatically if possible) and then sign out of FaceTime on the Mac. At that point, reboot the Mac yet again and sign in to FaceTime.\nIf that fails, you might have a hardware issue or severe bluetooth interference in the location where you are testing. Neither of which are going to be speedy or easy to troubleshoot for most people.\n", "Q: How many displays can a Mac Mini 2014 drive How many displays can a Mac Mini 2014 drive?\nGiven that the Mac Mini now has 2 thunderbolt + 1 HDMI video outputs, it would be able to drive 3 monitors right? It ofcourse depends on the resolutions. Not sure what that Intel Iris Graphics card can take.\n\nA: I've tried it with 3 displays, but no go.  Any combination of 2 displays work, but not 3 at the same time.\n\nA: http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hd-graphics/hd-graphics-developer.html\nA section in the webpage listed above states:\n\"View movies or presentations in ultra-high definition on Ultra HDTV or 4K resolution displays. With Intel Iris and Intel HD graphics, you can even daisy-chain up to three displays—or use collage mode to combine displays into a single unified higher resolution for larger screen sizes.\"\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Upgrade iPhone 5 from iOS 7.0.4 to iOS 7.1.2 I have an iPhone 5 that I use with Straight Talk (telecom provider) and I am trying to \"upgrade\" it from 7.0.4 to 7.1.2, or any release with the 7.x version for that matter.\nI specifically do not want to upgrade to IOS 8 just yet. \nI have the file \"iPhone5,2_7.1.2_11D257_Restore.ipsw\" but I get the error \"The device isn't eligible for the requested build.\" I've also hashed out the gs.apple address in my hosts file.\nI know you can't downgrade from 8 to 7, but in this case is there a way I can still upgrade to a later version of 7.x?\n\nA: Apple have stopped signing any iOS 7 for any device that can run iOS 8.\nAs far as I am aware, you have no other choices than to stay on 7.0.4 or go to 8.0.2\n", "Q: Make the menu bar in Yosemite opaque In Mavericks and earlier, it was possible to make the menu bar opaque, rather than the default translucent look.\nNow in Yosemite, it looks like translucency is the default, and the setting is gone from where it used to be, to toggle it.\nIs there a workaround for this? Such as a way to do it through Terminal?\n\nA: In System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, enable the \"Reduce Transparency\" option.\n(Note, though, that that disables transparency across the whole system; it doesn't seem like it's possible to disable the transparency just for the menu bar anymore.)\n\nA: In System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, enable the \"Increase contrast\" option.\n\nA: Accessibility → Display → Reduce transparency:\n\n\nA: I found another way to accomplish this in newer versions of macOS (e.g. Mojave and Catalina) that doesn't require turning on \"Reduce Transparency\" and therefore losing all of the other transparency effects in macOS.\nThe idea is to make a customized background image that fills your display and has white pixels underneath the exact area that the menu bar occupies.\nTo do this, following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your image editor of choice (such as Photoshop, Affinity Photo, or GIMP), create a new document whose resolution matches the resolution of your display.\n\n*Copy and paste in the image that you want to be your background, and arrange it in the document in whatever manner you choose (e.g. filling the entire document, centering it, etc.). Or, if you want a solid color background, simply fill the image with the color you want.\n\n*Create a white rectangle at the very top of the document that stretches across the entire document horizontally. Make sure its top edge lines up exactly with the top edge of the document.\n\n*If your display is not a retina display, make the rectangle's height be 22 pixels. If your display is a retina display, determine the rectangle's height in pixels using the following formula:\n\n\n[vertical resolution of your display] * 22 / [apparent height of display in pixels (as indicated in the Displays pref pane)]\n\n\n*Save the document as a png file, and make it your desktop background.\n\n\nFor example, if you have a 5k iMac and your main display is scaled to look like 2560x1440, your image's size would be 5120x2880 (the resolution of the display), and the white rectangle would be 44 pixels tall (or 2880 * 22 / 1440).\nHere's an example image that would work for a 1080p display.\nNote: this method has one important limitation, which is that if you change the resolution of your monitor, the image will no longer properly line up with the menu bar. So this method is only appropriate if you never plan to change your resolution.\n", "Q: How to use Family Sharing on iPhone 4 and other devices? I have multiple devices on 1 apple ID (an iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPod Touch 5, iPhone 4) and would like the devices to have separate apple IDs. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s have separate apple IDs and the iPhone 4 and iPod touch 5 will have the same apple ID. How can I setup the iPhone 4 to use family sharing even though it does not have iOS 8? Is this even possible?\nThanks!\n\nA: I turned on Family Sharing for my kids on my iPhone 5 that has iOS 8. After entering their emails, I entered their passwords. On their iOS 8 iPads, purchases from all the family members show up, but not on the iPod 4 or iPhone 4.\nHowever, my kids on those devices still have \"Ask to buy\" show up. If you want them to have access to all of your apps, you could jailbreak (redsn0w for iPod 4 on iOS 6 and evasi0n for iPhone 4 on iOS 7) and install Account Changer. If it weren't for the \"Ask to buy,\" we would have stayed with Account Changer only.\n\nA: As detailed in Apple's Family Sharing page, at the end, it states\n\niOS 8 and OS X Yosemite or later are required to set up or join a Family Sharing group and are recommended for full functionality.\n\nAs Trig mentioned, some features may still be available on devices that are not running iOS 8 or OS X Yosemite, such as Ask to Buy and Family Photo Sharing.\n\nA: Check if these two links can help you or not.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201088\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201085\n", "Q: How do iPhones get carrier locked remotely? My original iPhone 5 came directly from Virgin Mobile. As such, it's carrier locked.\nA few months back, I had what seemed like a hardware issue, and in the process of troubleshooting it, Apple replaced my handset. They brought me a brand new iPhone 5 out of the storage area in the back of the retail store. \nApple does not have a Virgin Mobile \"version\" of the iPhone. Your options are AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, or no carrier. This means that Apple could not have replaced my iPhone with one that was already locked to Virgin. Additionally, Virgin Mobile has never touched my phone. It went from the Apple Store directly to my pocket.\nThis indicates to me that the process of carrier locking takes place when you place a Virgin SIM card in the phone and call the company to activate it. Is this correct? Or if I had taken the brand new iPhone from the store and tried to set it up on some other service, would I have found it locked somehow? Does it have to do with restoring my settings from backup?\nHow does this remote carrier lock work?\n\nA: Per Virgin Mobile's Unlocking FAQ (emphasis mine):\n\nWhat does it mean for my device to be \"locked\"?\nThe term \"locked\" means that either Virgin Mobile software or the manufacturers' device designs restrict the device to use with a carrier operating on Sprint's network, such as Virgin Mobile.\n\nThey gave you a Sprint model at the Apple store.\n", "Q: Ping Issues using Thunderbolt to CAT Is anyone having a higher than usual ping when using a thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter? Or maybe the thunderbolt adaptor has a known issue?\nFound this thread, Ping on Mavericks on late 2013 MacBook Pro slow and variable compared to Windows\nbut it doesn't look to cover hardwire connections.  \n\nA: So I did the test using the ping command in terminal\nFor Google.com\nPing Google.com\n\nThe result for 2.5 GHz WiFi was: \n\n20 packets transmitted, 19 packets received, 5.0% packet loss\n  round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 16.295/18.872/30.858/2.935 ms\n\nwith transmit rate of 130.\nAnd for my 5 GHz WiFi:\n15 packets transmitted, 15 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 17.451/19.066/21.444/1.157 ms\nwith transmit rate of 216.\n", "Q: Can I configure the same gestures on Magic Mouse as Trackup? Is it possible to configure a Magic Mouse to have identical gestures to the trackpad?\nThe similarity of both a trackpad and magic mouse, but having the gestures not be the same, is very confusing. Two finger scroll? Pinch to zoom? Three finger mission control? Can I get all of these on the Magic Mouse?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool lets you configure both devices.\n", "Q: Can I just copy an application from a MAC and paste it to another MAC? As the title suggest, can I just copy and paste an application to my new MAC instead of downloading them all over again? Or is there another way to do this?\n\nA: Most applications downloaded from the Mac App Store are transferable to another Mac, either by network or removable media (USB, etc).\nYou can copy the applications to your new Mac.\n\nA: Try the migration assistant first.  It will move everything you need from your old mac. (OS 10.6.8 or later)  \nMany applications have data in the /Library/Application Support folder or the ~/Library/Application Support folder as well as prefeferences and other scattered support files that would all need to be moved.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to update a jailbroken iOS 7 to a version Apple has stopped signing? My iPad is running 7.0.2 and is jailbroken. It looks like Apple is not signing the 7.1.2 any longer.\nIs there a way to upgrade iOS to 7.1.2 without letting iTunes contact its home (i.e. Apple's servers)?\n\nA: Nope. It's impossible to upgrade iOS firmware without connecting to the Apple servers.\nCurrently, there is a jailbreak for iOS 8.1 using Pangu which is being signed at the moment. iOS 8.1.1 update which is due in a few weeks will patch the jailbreak. It could be the right moment to upgrade your iOS version and re-jailbreak it.  @saurik confirmed that the current iOS 8 jailbreak is stable.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic unlocking an unlocked mutex or spinlock on MacBook 2008 My MacBook 2008 froze and I had to press the power button.

Use the Updates page to install the 10.10 update or if you would like to download the full OS X installer click Continue.\n\nThere's only two buttons; \"Learn More\" and \"OK\".

The current most recent update for Apple's Java 6 was in May 2014. Oracle meanwhile has moved on to Java 7 and 8 for the platforms it supports, including OS X, and no longer provides free support for its Java 6.\nYou can have multiple Java 6, 7, and 8s installed at the same time on Mavericks (one JRE, multiple JDKs.)

I think it got formatted so I tried some data recovery softwares but was unable to recover any data. I had lot of data on it which I would like to recover, is it possible? \n\nA: To recover data from an external HDD formatted by Mac, you can use software TestDisk. Formatting is mainly performed when the HD gets corrupted due to software conflicts, bad sector etc. \nIn Mac OS X, you can use ‘Disk Utility’ to perform the formatting process. Once formatting is completed, you can use advanced data recovery tool.\n\nA: Seconding Douglas Gordon's answer, I've had a lot of success recovering data with TestDisk in the past.\nHowever if you are less comfortable using a command line tool, I would recommend Data Rescue as well. You could start with the free option (which allows recovery of up to 2GB of data) to see whether it will actually work for you.

Are there any known workarounds?\n\nA: This is related to graphics card switching. As @nneonneo said, disabling \"Automatic graphics switching\" is one option but the better option is to use \"gfxCardStatus\" application and make Yosemite stick to integrated (Intel) card which will prevent auto graphics switching and won't drain your battery and run hot as it would if you did the \"Automatic graphics switching\" way (because it sticks to discrete card).\nBTW: I can reproduce the problem on my MBPR Jun 2012. Go to this website in Safari, which triggers the automatic graphic switching. Refresh the page a few times and you will crash Yosemite. It seems to happen when it switches to discrete and back to integrated in quick succession.\nEdit:\nUsing that website, it won't crash as often as before. Because it was a WebGL component causing the switch and one of the updates did something related to \nWebGL.\n\nA: I can't say I've fixed the issue, but I disabled \"Automatic graphics switching\" in the Energy Saver preferences, and haven't had a crash like this for over a month.\nSince 10.10.1 was just released, I may try re-enabling that setting and seeing if it crashes any more...\n\nA: I was using chrome too, when spotted this issue. But there is nothing about chrome, as was mentioned before this is caused by auto graphic card switching from Iris to Nvidia. I have checked that on MBP 2014 July, with the page given above. If auto graphic switch is on, freeze is happening, else - not, there is no difference which browser or application is used, even if it would be forced to use only integrated or only discrete, system would not freeze. Once automatic switch would be enabled - it will freeze at switching intel->nvidia.\n", "Q: Force iCloud Drive to sync under Yosemite There are many questions of forcing iCloud to sync, but they are generally  old and unclear as to the details.\nI changed the file structure at my Mac, but the iOS App (Pages) doesn't seem to take the new update. \nWhen I look through the folder structure via another iOS App, there is still the old structure. So it seems that my changes on the Mac didn't update yet.\nIs there a way in Yosemite to force the iCloud sync?\n\nThere has to be a service which is triggered and runs in the background. Which service is it?\n\n\nA: Yes. The sync process is kicked off when you disconnect from all networks and then reconnect. You can debug things using brctl log -w on the Mac and AppleCare can also help you with iOS cloud sync diag logs if you have an issue that needs that level of debugging. \nThe brctl man page has information on diagnostic files and you can also use sysdiagnose to assist with cloud sync diagnosis.\nThe actual sync daemon is bird but you don't run it directly. \nLastly, before digging into the logs, I often use https://iCloud.com to verify that the Mac and iOS devices are either in sync with the cloud version so I know which of the three is lagging. \n\nA: If you run a VPN, that may also occasionally stall things.

Several command line utilities like clang, make and git all become available when Xcode.app is installed. So I thought that the separate package of command line tools are only for those who do not want a full IDE installed.\nBut to my surprise, one of the linking problems I encountered when compiling MacVim can be successfully solved by installing the command line tools with xcode-select --install. So apparently the Xcode.app and the command line tools differ, at least in subtle ways. What is the difference then? Does the latter have better coverage for all the essentials for programming than the former?\nCurrently I am using Xcode 6.0.1 on Mavericks.\n\nA: You can see it as:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command line tools are the basic foundation. Many basic tools are needed to compile your Swift/Objective-C code.\n\n*XCode is the IDE which brings a few additional packages with it. \n\n\n\nSo the command line tools get sure that the basic UNIX tools are\n  covered (as GCC for example) to be able to compile and link code.\n\nXcode then is using those basic tools.\n\nFrom the documents:\nWhat is the Command Line Tools Package?\n\nThe Command Line Tools Package is a small self-contained package\n  available for download separately from Xcode and that allows you to do\n  command line development in OS X. It consists of two components: OS X\n  SDK and command-line tools such as Clang, which are installed in\n  /usr/bin.\n\n", "Q: Personal Hotspot in Yosemite only shows up after unlocking iPhone The Personal Hotspot in Yosemite only shows up in my WiFi network list after unlocking the iPhone - is it supposed to be like that?\nI thought it should be possible to use it \"without touching the iPhone\"?\n\nA: That doesn't match my experiences using iOS 8.0.2 and OS X 10.10 as I can initiate a request to start the hotspot while the phone is in my briefcase, locked, with the LCD screen off to save power.\nNow, those requests often fail to connect properly many, many times - in fact, the success rate is far lower than the failure rate for me so far, but it has worked flawlessly from time to time.\nI find that when a request to build up the tethering fails, I have the best success by getting the iOS device, unlocking it, navigating to the personal hotspot and toggle it off, wait at least 5 seconds, toggle it on and then cycle the WiFi on the Mac.\nThat almost always works to enable tethering for me on the current software versions. I suspect the reliability of this will get better with iOS 8.1 and future updates to OS X to have the requests work more often, but the design is clearly to allow requests at any time the devices are in range. If you can't even request the hotspot, perhaps you have a large amount of interference or the hardware of one device is not working properly.\n", "Q: Getting used to either US or EN International keyboard layout I will buy a new Macbook soon. I am german and used to the german keyboard layout:\n\nSince I do alot of coding and many special characters are placed inconveniently on the german keyboard (e.g. { and }) I will purchase either a US or a EN International keyboard.  \nI am tempted to buy the standard US one, because I like to believe that this is the way the ANSI has conceived the keyboard layout to be. However, I am concerned that I will not get used to the small return key, and will accidently press \\ often.\n\n\nWhat can you recommend me? Do you think I will get used to the small return quickly?\n\nA: US Standard.\nFor one, Apple only offer the option of US Standard in some territories now. US International exists for its close resemblance to UK version. Secondly, US Standard is the pervalant QWERTY across countries regardless of the manufacturer. Plus, symmetry. I guess if you need to re-learn where all the symbol keys are anyways, why not use the keyboard that doesn't have a symbol key left of \"Z\"? It's just better.\nIf you want you can install Karabiner, and remap \"\\\" into \"return\" key, and map option+\"\\\" back to \"\\\". This way no worries about that annoyance. \n\nA: The US one is fine. There won't be any problems with the return key after a couple of days of use. Your main worry is probably locations of symbols: @, ?, / etc.\n", "Q: Clock problems with dual boot mac system:- 10.6 and 10.8 I have a dual boot mac pro 3,1 : one hard drive with Snow Leopard (10.6.8) and one with Mountain Lion (10.8.?).

This should help with the clock, but fixing the battery issue will make sure nothing else is bad.\nAfter replacing the battery, resetting the PRAM would be a good idea.\nOS X Mountain Lion: Reset your computer’s PRAM\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ph11243\nhttp://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2010/12/04/how-when-why-to-reset-the-pram-smc-on-your-mac/\nhttp://www.macexpertguide.com/2012/11/18/reset-pram-mac-troubleshooting/\nhttp://macs.about.com/od/usingyourmac/qt/Reset-Pram.htm\n", "Q: Import .ACO color palette for Mac (for use with Keynote, Omnigraffle etc) I want to use my ACO color palettes from Photoshop to be available in Keynote, Omingraffle etc.\nIs there any tool out there to export ACO files to whatever format that is needed to load that palette into Mac OSX system wide color palette?\nCannot find anything on the web that helps...\nThank you!\n\nA: I've found at least two applications in the App Store that do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*The simple Color Palette Importer (which worked perfectly for\nme) lets you import Adobe's aco files more or less directly into the OSX color picker.\n\n*The more comprehensive (and more pricey) ColorSchemer Studio lets you import palettes from a number of different formats, including Adobe's ase and aco, and exports palettes to, among oter formats, Apple's clr.\n\n\nThese two are just the ones I found, but there are tons of different apps for managing colors/palettes in the App Store, so there may be other apps there that can do the job, too.\n", "Q: Moving photos from iPhone 5S to Laptop I am going to buy an iPhone 5s 16GB. Now my query is whether any videos that I still store in my phone can later get transferred into my laptop? That way I can save spaces by not keeping unnecessary videos, images, etc.\n\nA: Yes. This is very easily done. All you need to use is iPhoto. Plug the device in, and (if it hasn't already,) open iPhoto. Click your device in the left-hand side menu, and click \"Import Photos\" on the prompt. The photos & videos will now be imported.\nAt the end of this, there will be another prompt. Click \"Delete Photos\" and the photos & videos will be removed from your device.\n\nA: One can use iPhoto.app or Image Capture.app or Apeture.app to download photos from your iPhone.\nImage Capture.app is available for free on any Mac with as part of the system installation, while iPhoto.app (free) and Apeture.app (paid) are pieces of software available in the online App Store. iPhoto.app also comes bundled as part of a new Mac purchase, so most users have a copy installed on their machine.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/iphoto/id408981381?mt=12\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12\nApple has instructions on importing from an iOS device to all of these pieces of software, as well as info for Windows computer users: \niOS: Import personal photos and videos from iOS devices to your computer\nOn iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, you can capture photos and videos using the built-in camera or save images from apps, such as Safari and Mail, to your device.

I am looking for a (most) powercord-safe way to pack my MagSafe adapter for a daily backpack commute.\nOfficial Apple recommendations (as illustrated by third-party videos like this) don't prevent the breaks at all, as my experience with 2 MagSafes showed.\nThird-party supplements promising a solution don't sound very convincing:\n\n\n*\n\n*MagSavior is clearly a hard-plastic solution which just moves the cord breaking point farther from the adapter\n\n*The Fray Fix seems nearly impossible to install despite looking promising after that\n\n\nA: One method I use on all my power adaptors is to loop the cable and secure it with a piece of Velcro. I will generally either keep folding the cable in half until it is a bit longer than fist size, or just loop it back and forth in a “S” pattern that is about fist size. I do NOT loop it in a circle.\nI find these methods keep the cord safe and tangle free, allow quick deployment, and don’t put pressure where the cable comes out of the adaptor. I have never suffered from frayed cables using this method.  If you don’t have a Velcro strap, a rubber band will work. \nHere's a photo of 2010 adapter that has been deployed around the world. Dirty, but fully functional, and no frays!\n\n\nA: One solution, if you can afford it, is to purchase another adapter and leave it at work. That's what I did after replacing one. Saves weight and bulk in the book bag, too!\nAnother idea is a plastic or metal case of just the right size to hold the adaptor without bending the cabling.\nReinforcing the ends with white gaffer's tape is also a solution. If you grew up taping your eye-glasses together because you were a nerd, this is a perfect solution. \nLastly, leaving a loop in the cable where it exits the adapter body, (as illustrated in the Apple page,) instead of a sharp bend, is the next best remedy.\n\nA: I agree with Stephen Spencer: looping the cable loosely preserves it well. I also agree with IconDaemon that an additional adapter kept in the remote locations eases the back-and-forth transition.\nMy wife and I travel a lot. Here's how I do it:\nAll the cords and adapters I might need are carried in a small, easy-to-pack nylon case:\n\nOpened, it looks like this: \nThe power adapter is in one end compartment, with its cord passing around that side of the case to where it's coiled in the end space.

Everything worked fine.\n\nA: You could also try Internet recovery\nTo do this boot your Mac while holding option+command+R Then when it loads (takes about 5 mins) go to disk utility and format your drive.

I can still use my phone, but it bothers me a lot! Please help!\n\nA: It sounds like you might have removed the protective coating in that corner of the screen and that now you have two options (one of which is better than the other!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Apply acetone to the remainder of the screen - carefully, so the appearance of the screen is once more uniform in appearance. Then immediately buy a protective film for the phone's screen.\n\n*Take the phone for repair, asking for the screen to be replaced.\n\n\nOption 1 involves no cost since you (obviously) already have acetone. Option 2 will be a fairly pricy repair, as it will involve replacing the entire screen, and there is literally no way you can claim that the damage was caused by anything except for your own actions. Option 2 is the 'correct' way to fix the problem.\nThe lesson you can take away from this is: be very careful with solvents and cleaning chemicals around sensitive equipment - especially if the equipment has a special finish.\n", "Q: Toshiba 2TB External Drive Stopped Being Recognised After a lot of searching on the internet I have been unable to find a solution to my problem.

For Thunderbird there is the External Editor extension a very very classical piece of software that, when called via a shortcut, pops up your external editor (emacs in my case) and let's you edit your mail there.  While editing the compose window of Thunderbird is blocked.  When the external editor closes, the compose window is populated with the updated text of the mail.  Very convenient to have your mail as one buffer in your emacs, for instance to edit tables, copy computational results, use power editing features like regexp-search-and-replace, etc.\nMy question: Is it possible to implement the same thing using Mac OS Mail + AppleScript or other tricks?\n\nA: I recently got my first Mac and was facing the same situation concerning my mail-writing habbits (using Thunderbird with external editor and vi on Linux). So far, I could not find an appropriate answer. Thus I started to look into Applescript.\nI would like to enter mail addresses or add attachments in Apple Mail's composer window, while editing the message body in vi. So, I start with a composer window (either for a new mail or with a reply to another email) and when finished with addresses, I close the composer window and save the message as draft.\nWith the following Applescript script I can then extract addresses, subject, and message body into a textfile and open it with vi:\ntell application \"Mail\"\n        # Set global variables.\n        set msgfilename to \"/Users/me/Documents/message\"\n        set msgheaderdelimiter to linefeed & \"#+#+#+#+#+#This line serves as delimiter for applescript.#+#+#+#+#+#\" & linefeed\n        set msgdraft to first item of messages of drafts mailbox\n\n        # Open file to edit message.\n        try\n                set msgfile to open for access msgfilename with write permission\n        on error number -49\n                say \"Error, file already open.\"\n                close access msgfilename\n                set msgfile to open for access msgfilename with write permission\n        end try\n        set eof msgfile to 0\n\n        # Extract information from the message and write it to the file\n        set msgrecipients to to recipients of msgdraft\n        write \"To: \" to msgfile as «class utf8»\n        repeat with rcp in msgrecipients\n                set addr to address of rcp\n                write addr to msgfile as «class utf8»\n                write \",\" to msgfile as «class utf8»\n        end repeat\n        write linefeed & \"CC: \" to msgfile starting at -1 as «class utf8»\n        set msgrecipients to cc recipients of msgdraft\n        repeat with rcp in msgrecipients\n                set addr to address of rcp\n                write addr to msgfile as «class utf8»\n                write \",\" to msgfile as «class utf8»\n        end repeat\n        write linefeed & \"Subject: \" to msgfile starting at -1 as «class utf8»\n        set msgsubject to subject of msgdraft\n        write msgsubject to msgfile starting at eof as «class utf8»\n        set msgcontent to content of msgdraft\n        write msgheaderdelimiter to msgfile as «class utf8»\n        write msgcontent to msgfile starting at eof as «class utf8»\n        close access msgfile\n        delete msgdraft\nend tell\n\n# Start gvim with the prepared message file\ndo shell script \"/usr/local/bin/gvim /Users/me/Documents/message\"\n\nAfter editing the message body, I save the textfile and close vi.

A bit worse, attachments are lost, when switching from the message composer to vi and back. It would be desired, that the new message composer window is opened automatically as vi is closed, without a manual script start as above. So, I am not completely happy with it yet, but maybe it's a starting point where some more advanced users can add improvements.\n", "Q: How to receive iMessages ONLY on the device you are currently using?

Here you can see all the apps that have requested access to Location Services and also what permission they have been granted (\"Never\", \"While Using\" or \"Always\").

That way, contiguous memory reads and writes are using each memory bank in turn, resulting in higher memory throughputs due to reduced waiting for memory banks to become ready for desired operations.\n\nSource : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved_memory\n", "Q: Mac Dictation - How to select backspace?

TL;DR: Does a clean install reset everything (like SMC, for example)? If not, what else should I do to be sure the computer is completely reset, like it just came from the factory?\nMy macbook has been acting weirdly for the past few weeks, so I decided to give it clean install with Yosemite.\nI think I messed up the SMC and resetting it does not help. I have a Bootcamp partition that I used to play games. My macbook pro would get very hot while gaming on Windows, so I installed Lubbo's Fan Control. That worked for a couple days, until I realized that while booted in OSX the fans were not working at all or working full speed. I tried resetting the SMC, but that didn't help. So I installed iStat Menus, and controlled my fans manually (yeah, a lazy solution). Now I have one fan controlling app on Windows and one on OSX, and neither work as expected (in iStat when I set it to 'default' the fans stop working).\nAlso, I have been installing a lot of things, and leftover files are all over the place.\nSo, now I'm getting rid of Bootcamp and clean installing Yosemite. How do I go about doing this properly and thoroughly? I'd like to make the computer fresh as it just came out of the factory. Should I do anything besides a clean install?\n\nA: A fresh OS install won't reset the hardware, SMC or PRAM. It might be well worth checking both those are correctly reset before going so far as a wipe & install.\nReset the PRAM first - hold Cmd/Opt/P/R at the chimes & wait for the chimes to happen a second time.\nSMC varies per machine, Mac Pro is sufficient to power off & leave the mains plug out for a minute.

I hit \"Back Up Now\" before bed, and when I got up in the morning, it had completed the Back Up.  After the initial Back Up, it works just fine now!    \n\nA: I had the same problem. I don't know whether turning FileVault on was related (this process was suggested during Yosemite installation). However, I retried backup when FileVault finished and it worked that time.\nRemember that Yosemite installation brings around new 6 GB that will be backed up. So, the preparation of backing up will delay more than usual.\n", "Q: Is it possible to buy an iOS Developer Program for an IBC that was formed in Belize? I am thinking about buying an Apple Developer Program through an offshore company. It has many tax advantages. Is it possible?

What risks are there when using an IBC?\n\nA: If you have never enrolled in the developer program, I would budget $99 to start with a personal account to get use to enrolling and how things work.\nSince Apple doesn't even operate a web store for Belize, you may run into some roadblocks and have to incorporate there as well as in a country that has an online store.

Scrounging up a copy of 3.1.05187 WORKS (kind of) on my Mac.\nI said \"scrounge\" because I couldn't download the correct version from Cisco's web site, because I don't have a login there associated with our license, and I couldn't get our local tech folks to understand why I couldn't just install the \"MSI\" file on my Mac.\nAnyway, searching the web for \"anyconnect-macosx-i386-3.1.05187-k9.dmg\" unearthed a copy from a university web site (not something I like to do, particularly with security software), and behold, it installed and runs!\nOne wrinkle: unlike the older version, the newer one didn't route DNS lookups through the VPN. When Cisco establishes a VPN connection, it seems they edit \"/etc/resolv.conf\" to add the VPN's DNS servers. That doesn't work, and there's a warning to that effect in the Apple-generated \"resolv.conf\" file. \nMy work-around is to consult what Cisco added and manually add those servers through the Mac OS X Network Preference Pane.\n\nA: Here’s how to clean your caches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open ~/Library/Caches in Finder.\n\n*From the Menu bar, choose Edit > Select All.\n\n*Drag all of the items to the Trash.\n\n*From the Macintosh HD, choose Library > Caches.\n\n*Choose Edit > Select All, and drag the items to the Trash.

After upgrading my Macbook Pro to Yosemite, the volume icon at the top right is greyed out and sound does not work.  \nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: I had to open Sound Preferences, change to Output tab, and select \"Internal Speakers\".\n\n\nA: This can be caused by the default sound settings being changed.  If you go to System Preferences --> Sound --> \"Sound Effects\" you will see a pull down list labeled Play sound effects through... On my machine there was the following listed: Internal Speakers and my monitor.  \nFor some reason after the OS upgrade my monitor (and HDMI) was selected instead of internal speakers.  Switching to Internal Speakers fixed this.  You should select the appropriate item for your setup.  Also, you can go to the Output and Input tabs and verify that the correct item is selected as well.  See this picture for additional information:\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.  It turned out that I had my external screen plugged in while I ran the update so the sound was defaulting to HDMI out rather than internal sound or bluetooth. \nWent to sound preferences, changed it and it worked. \n\nA: Same problem here, disabled sound control.

Alternative/fix? I am on OS X 10.9.5 and recently (can't remember if this happened during 10.9.4 or not) \nFunctionFlip has started to work very inconsistently for me. \nBasically I use this to enable the F1-F10 keys for use in terminal (and some of them I set to do stuff like next/prev. tab e.g. in web browser) and I used FunctionFlip to generally enable the volume control keys so that they work globally. \nBut lately it's just not been \"kicking in\" so it's hit and miss every time i try to change the volume. \n\nA: I got tired of FunctionFlip not working right and finally found Karbiner does exactly what I want and works great.\n\nA: Fluor is a relative newcomer to this space. I'm not sure if it's exactly what you want because it doesn't allow you to assign the functionality on a per key basis - it's either all F keys or all apple functions:\n\nFluor is a tool that allows you to automatically change the behaviour of the keyboard's fn keys depending on the active application.\n\nBut it is open source, works on macOs Sierra and is actively developed (as of March 2017).\n\nA: I had an insight about 2 sentences into typing this question. BetterTouchTool has global keyboard shortcut functionality (in fact I already use BTT for app-specific keyboard shortcuts), which turns out works perfectly for this by binding the F11 and F12 keys. Even more awesome, I can also use it to set app-specific shortcuts, and this lets me override so I can assign these two keys to other functions when I am in iTerm!\nBTT is 100% necessary for OSX and I don't understand why Apple hasn't taken the hint and integrated its functionality into the OS.

If I choose Reinstall OS X it kicks off the Mavericks (re)install screens.\nShouldn't there be a Yosemite recovery partition that replaced this? Is there any way to manually create the partition? Is this just how it's supposed to be with a Mavericks recovery partition after a Yosemite upgrade?\n\nA: I had the same issue since the beta and the official release did not solve this issue.\nIn the terminal I had the following output:\n\ndiskutil list\n\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            210.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                40.1 GB    disk0s4\n\na recovery partition was available (but not working)\nThe following did fix my issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*downloaded the yosemite installer (again)\n\n*created a bootable installation (8GB USB) drive with yosemite (USB drive volume name is Untitled).\n\n\n\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing the not working recovery partition\n\n\n\ndiskutil eraseVolume HFS+ ErasedDisk /dev/disk0s3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*merging the free space with the Macintosh HD partition\n\n\n\ndiskutil mergePartitions HFS+ MacHD disk0s2 disk0s3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Install (like you upgrade) Yosemite over your existing (Yosemite) installation and complete the installation procedure (I used the installer from the fresh created USB).\n\n\nAfter the installation was completed I rebooted the machine and I was able to use the find my Mac option again (error related to the recovery partition was gone).\nThis worked for me, a small (typing) error might result in loosing your installation  + data.

It no longer shows in the list of drives when you boot with the option key pressed.  The way to do it is by pressing Command-R.\nI don't have Fusion Drive and still all my Macs ended up with Core Volumes after Yosemite Install and without Recovery HD showing up.  Even after erasing, merging and reinstalling I ended up with Core Volume and no Recovery HD in boot options.\nCommand-R works.\nPerhaps with Yosemite, you always end up with Core Volume?\nIf so, Apple should do a better job in communicating the change.\n\nA: When you use the recovery option to reinstall OS X it is supposed to download and install the most recent version of OS X previously installed on this computer to perform the install. The install image isn't stored on your machine.\nThis is why Apple specify that you need an Internet connection to perform a recovery install.\n\nIn order to reinstall OS X, you need to be connected to the Internet over an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network.\n\nI'm guessing the reason you are getting the Mavericks installer is because something went wrong with your previous install (given that you're trying to use Recovery then I'm guessing something went wrong). Essentially it is trying to install the \"Last Known Good\" (to steal a phrase from Windows) version of the OS.\n\nA: Last time I was surprised how easy it was to restore the recovery partition using Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC). Basically all you need is a intact recovery partition on an external disk. If you don't have that simply install OSX onto an USB drive.

It no longer exists on a clean Yosemite install.\nFrom the man launchctl file:\n\nlaunchctl no longer has an interactive mode, nor does it accept commands from stdin. The /etc/launchd.conf file is no longer consulted for subcommands to run during early boot time; this functionality was removed for security considerations.\n\n\nA: Suggested method for most versions of macOS is to create the property list file (.pfile) of a user agent in a LaunchAgents directory.\nThis can be created by the following command:\n\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy /Library/LaunchAgents/com.launchd.maxfiles.plist -c \"add Label string com.launchd.maxfiles\" -c \"add ProgramArguments array\" -c \"add ProgramArguments: string launchctl\" -c \"add ProgramArguments: string limit\" -c \"add ProgramArguments: string maxfiles\" -c \"add ProgramArguments: string 10240\" -c \"add ProgramArguments: string unlimited\" -c \"add RunAtLoad bool true\"\n\nDocumentation page: Creating Launch Daemons and Agents.\nRelated: How to persistently control maximum system resource consumption on Mac?\n", "Q: glossy or matte? I just bought a mint condition late 2011 MC721LL MacBook Pro which looks perfect, but I am curious about the display specs.  The screen has a low sheen matte look, but the resolution is 900 x 1440, so it is not the high resolution screen.. It also has the standard black surround, rather than the silver bezel. \nI have owned other MacBooks with standard glossy screens, including a 2009, and this screen on the 2011 Macbook has a much lower sheen, but resolution specs are standard Macbook specs..  Seems odd.   Was there a matte option with the standard resolution display?\n\nA: From Everymac - \n\nThe standard configuration of this model has an LED-backlit 15.4\" widescreen TFT active-matrix \"glossy\" display (1440x900 native resolution), but it also was available via custom configuration with a \"high-resolution glossy\" 1680x1050 display and a \"high-resolution antiglare\" 1680x1050 display for an additional US$100 and US$150, respectively.\n\nRef : http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.0-15-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\nSo, the answer would appear to be - 'No, there was no matte option at standard res 1440x900'\n", "Q: Replacing Yosemite RED/ORANGE/GREEN window buttons with standard Mac OS X icons? I've tried Yosemite on my MacBook Air (testing machine). I think it is ugly, bland, and the most un-Apple-ish OS that Apple has ever released. One of the most irritating design aspects is the RED/AMBER/GREEN window buttons (Close/minimise etc) which look to me like they were designed by a child.\nAre there any tricks or methods for replacing the Yosemite rendition of these Mac OS X buttons with the usual ones we are all familiar with? \n\nA: There are some applications that allow you to change the theme in OS X.\nHowever they might need a little time to be updated for the new UI in Yosemite.\nFor example Flavours which is being updated but isn't quite ready yet.\n\nA: I made a quick theme to change the 'traffic lights' to how they were before. Here are the installment instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*WARNING: I made this on MacOS Sierra 10.12.1, so using it in other versions might cause severe issues. I'm also not responsible for any bad side effects.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download this file: http://www.mediafire.com/file/ortjz8deky9977r/SystemAppearance.car\n\n*In Finder, go to /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearence.bundle/contents/Resources\n\n*Keep a copy of SystemAppearance.car from there for any emergencies\n\n*Replace the original SystemAppearance.car with the one you just downloaded\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n\n\nA: There's only one theme that I know of for Yosemite that changes the traffic lights:\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/art/Yosemite-Theme-Clearify-477715451\nBe careful when replacing system files like these, always backup your system and keep copies of the original files somewhere safe!\n\nA: Go into System Preferences > General > Highlight Color and select the grey graphite color.\nNow your window buttons will all be grey. Hooray, no more kiddie colors!\n", "Q: Mac App Store Won't Open on Macbook Pro For the past few weeks my Mac App Store hasn't been loading correctly.

I'm trying to upgrade a Macbook Pro to Yosemite. It downloaded everything just fine, restarted the machine into the installer process. That went just fine until it just stopped.\nIt's on the \"Installing on 'Macintosh HD'\" screen with a progressbar sitting at around 60% and says \"About 29 minutes remaining\". It's been sitting in that same spot for over two hours now.\nDoes anyone have any advice on what to do at this point?\nUPDATE: I ended up holding down the power button to halt the machine, turned it on again, and hoped that it would start okay. It did. :)  It just appeared to restart the install process, and everything was fine. It got to the last minute or so and took quite awhile, but it did finish.\nApparently having Homebrew installed, or something else which stores a bunch of files in /usr/local, will cause this last-minute slowdown of the installer. You can either move those files before you install or you can just wait it out during the last minute.\nI'm really not sure what caused the installer to halt at the 29 minute mark. But just turning it off/on did not hurt anything.\n\nA: As recommended by 0942v8653, Command+L will show you the log and give you a better idea what is going on. In my case, the delay was due to copying of TexLive that had an enormous number of files.\n\nA: I experienced nearly identical symptoms.  I got down to 1 minute and it sat there for hours (literally).  I am hesitant to advocate following my experience, but here's what I did and it worked:\nI moved the mouse to the upper left corner of the screen and found that menus appeared.  I selected an option to restart the computer.  It appeared to restart the installation, not the download.  It took a long time again.  It then seemed to hang again, similarly.  This time I chose to power off from the menu.\nWhenever the machine appeared to hang, I waited a long time to be sure (30 minutes or more), as I did NOT want to interrupt a process just because I couldn't see that which was happening.  Eventually, after about 4-6 power off and on cycles, the process seemed to complete, and I'm using that machine now.\nFYI, amongst the menu options was one to view the logs, though the information didn't clarify anything for me.\n\nA: Do you have a backup?\nIf so, it’s quite easy to interrupt the install, perhaps look at the logs and either try again after cleaning or just go for an erase install.\n", "Q: Can I limit the notification noise to one device when I get a message?

For more information, see the Developer Guide\".\nThe video is Mpeg 4, 640x1136 etc. so this seems odd. Has anyone been able to upload a video in this way?\n\n\nA: Here is a trick using just iMovie and Quicktime to get the right dimensions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use QuickTime to record a short clip from the size of the device you need\n\n*Use iMovie and insert that clip into a new \"App Preview\" project\n\n*Add your actual video after the short clip\n\n\nNow, any clips that you export will be in the right dimensions. \nIf you need to hide your short clip, you can shorten it to 0.1 seconds. Put a title over it and delete the text. Now your video starts with 0.1 seconds of a black screen. \n", "Q: Discoveryd Alternative to Replace mDNSResponder Argument? This is a direct follow-on to this question. Before Yosemite, I'd add the \"-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains\" argument to the mDNSResponder plist file so that all local resolver lookups added the search domains, regardless of whether there was a period in the label to be looked up. For example, whether I try to ssh to hostname foo.bar or foo, the search domain of baz.com should be tried, not only for the latter case, as was (and is) the default behavior. \nNow, it looks like the mDNSResponder is gone, replaced with discoveryd. I cannot find a similar option to get it to always appending the search domain. Suggestions? I'd rather not go the route of using a non-default local resolver, but I'd consider it as an option. For now, I'll just type in the long FQDNs, but I'd really rather not.\nThanks,\nPete\n\nA: Run sudo discoveryutil mdnsactivedirectory yes in Terminal. According to https://discussions.apple.com/message/26927843#26927843 it is the solution.\nThis can be made to run automatically whenever launching a terminal without a password:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo visudo\n\n*\n\n*add a line to the bottom %admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/discoveryutil\n\n*If admin group doesn't work, run groups at the terminal and use an appropriate group - perhaps 'staff' or 'everyone'.

No idea why there is a second resolver without a search domain listed.\n\nA: Here is a hacked up solution using a local nameserver - works for me:\nhttps://github.com/joedj/yosemite_dnsfix\n", "Q: Automatically Trigger Automator through mail I want to trigger a workflow in automator every time I receive a new email in \"mail.app\". How can this be done?\n\nA: Yes it can:\nYou can use the normal Mail rules with a perform action: Run Applescript.\nCreate a normal  Mail rule applescript. But include code to call your automator workflow via the unix command /usr/bin/automator.\nThe /usr/bin/automator command will run the workflow you point it at and optionally can pass input  onto the workflow using the -i option.\nHere is a quick example of a Applescript Mail rule which gets the subject of the email/s and runs a automator workflow that speaks any text passed on to it. In this case the email subject.\nThe script MUST be saved in: your ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail  folder for mail.app to see them.\n\nYou can attach a script to a Mail rule. For example, you could have an\n  incoming message trigger a script that copies information from the\n  message and pastes it into a database that works with AppleScript.\nChoose Mail > Preferences, then click Rules. Add a rule or select an\n  existing rule to edit.\nChoose Run AppleScript from the “Perform the\n  following actions” pop-up menu.\nChoose a script from the pop-up menu\n  of scripts that are located in ~/Library/Application\n  Scripts/com.apple.mail.\nOr choose “Open in Finder” to open the folder\n  so you can copy a script into the folder first.\nIf you later move or rename the\n  script, your rule will not work.\nClick OK to save the rule.\n\n\n\nThe example Applescript for the Rule\n(Change the  workFlowPath property to reflect the full path to your Automator workflow file)  \nproperty workFlowPath : quoted form of (\"/Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/mailSpeakTest.workflow\") --CHANGE THIS TO YOUR FULL WORKFLOW FILE PATH example  \"/Users/joeblogs/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail/mailSpeakTest.workflow\"\n\n\n    using terms from application \"Mail\"\n        on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule\n            repeat with eachMessage in theMessages\n                (*Get the email Subject *)\n                set input_Argument to subject of eachMessage\n                (*Run subroutine for workflow *)\n                my runAutomator(input_Argument)\n            end repeat\n        end perform mail action with messages\n    end using terms from\n\n    (*Workflow  Subroutine *)\n    on runAutomator(input_Argument)\n\n        (*Path to workflow *)\n\n\n        (*Setup and Run the unix command *)\n        set command to \"/usr/bin/automator   -i \" & quoted form of input_Argument & space & workFlowPath\n        do shell script command\n    end runAutomator\n\nThe Automator workflow is simply\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to restart an iPhone? I just want to restart my iPhone not turn it off + turn it back on.\nIn Android there is an option.\n\nA: You force restart iPhone simply by pressing and holding both the home button and the power button until you see the Apple logo. For this force restart both buttons are held simultaneously. \nI have been in at least one situation where the phone would not power off and the only way to get the phone back working was to force restart.\nThis is similar to holding the power button down on a computer and crashing it entirely, and just like a computer, is typically only needed on rare occasions when nothing else will work. Refer to this KB document for more information: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1430.\n\nA: There is not an option of restarting an (unjailbroken) iOS device normally with one click (soft reset). However there is a thing called a \"hard reset\". This is intended for occasions where the iOS device does not react. The hard reset is described in the answers above: Hold both Home and Power Button for about ten - twelve seconds (until the apple logo appears). This is not intended for everyday use. To restart an iPhone normally just power it off and power it on again. The difference between the two is that with a soft reset all the memory (RAM) gets written to the disk. When the device boots all of that is loaded into the RAM again. This means that memory leaks will not be resolved this way. On a hard reset all this does not happen and the iPhone does not load what was loaded before. It is equivalent to pulling the plug on a desktop.\nOn jailbroken devices there are apps available that do a normal restart by clicking a button, but I hardly recommend not to jailbreak your device.\nSources:\nApple Support Communities\n\nA: Yes, restarts are possible. Hold the home button and the lock button until the Apple logo is displayed.Switching it off & on is the same as restarting.\n", "Q: Textmate OSX Yosemite ruby 1.8 After upgrading to the OSX Yosemite, Textmate's duplicate line command \nctrl+shift D produces an error warning: -K is specified; it is for 1.8 compatibility and may cause odd behavior.\n\nPreviously, this was fixed by changing the PATH to /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\n\nBut now this does not work. \n\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: You can install Ruby 1.8.7 via rbenv and add it to Textmate paths:\n\nPATH:\n  /Users/YOUR_NAME/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p249/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nTM_RUBY: /Users/YOUR_NAME/.rbenv/versions/1.8.7-p249/bin/ruby\n\nIf you have problems with installing ruby 1.8.7 with errors such as:\n\nopenssl_missing.h:68: error: conflicting types for 'HMAC_CTX_copy'\n\nyou can try to do brew unlink openssl.

I would like to share a folder like Dropbox does, but under Share I can not find such an option.\n\nA: As it currently stands (March 2015) you cannot share iCloud folder, but you can share individual iCloud files. Even if your recipient does't have iCloud account they will be able to view and edit your iCloud documents. \nOpen a document on your iCloud site, and click share button on the top toolbar. You will be given a link and some options (readonly vs editing, password protection).\n\n\nA: Since September 2017 (iOS 11), you can now share files via Files app (or on iCloud.com).\nSimply navigate to the file you want to share -> click on the share icon -> click \"Add People\" -> then you can share a copy of the link to the file/folder.\nFor some reason, folders aren't supported yet.\n\nA: Before macOS High Sierra and iOS 10 release the answer was \"No - iCloud drive and its folder structure is strictly for sharing with one account.\" You can now share files but not entire folders easily.\nNow with iOS 10 and High Sierra and newer, you can share from the share control on macOS and choose a file. You can share with the generic \"add people\" icon files but not folders currently. You can share from the web interface and iOS as well.\n\nFor some iWork documents and photos, you can share them individually or by adding someone to a shared photo album, but that's based on the app design and not a more general folder based file sharing idiom. \nYou can also avail yourself of all the share sheets when an app like Things or OneNote or Acorn can accept a shared file from iCloud.\nAlso -  Apple's MailDrop feature to email each file to the recipient(s) that need to share the file, but it wouldn't be anything that's hosted and really shared in the sense that a change to the file by one user would then be reflected on the cloud. When that works it's great since you don't have to plan to share out the files - it just happens.\nClearly, iCloud isn't competing directly with Box.com and DropBox but it has picked up tons of useful features and the live on line collaboration for iWork documents and notes is really fantastic in 2018 now that we have some real sharing features in iCloud.\n\nA: Jan 26 2017, you still can't share folders. \nTry using insync.io you can share the folders in your icloud drive without moving the files from their original location.

I usually use the IPad and I delete emails from there. I do not know how to sync all three of these machines to get rid of the deleted emails and update everything else. Can someone tell me how to do this? I am new at this syncing thing.\n\nA: Are you using POP3 or IMAP for your email?\nIf your service is POP3, then each machine will download emails unread by that machine, up to the retention limit of the mail server.\nThis means that you will always have to manually delete each email from each machine. \nThere is the possibility that you can adjust the retention limit, to reduce the amount of backlog that is downloaded. The retention period usually starts after the first device has downloaded that particular message, so you don't lose any mail if no machine picks up messages for a few days etc. You would need to ask your Service Provider how to do that.\nIf you use IMAP, then the emails actually always live on the remote server, so any action you take will be reflected across any machine that accesses that remote data.\nWhich of those services you use is usually not choosable by the user, it's in the hands of your Service Provider.\n", "Q: How do I make Finder snap to grid regardless of the number of items in the directory? Maybe I have a case of acute OCD, I don't know - but this issue irks me more than it really should.\nI set up my Finder settings to display four files or directories horizontally, snapped to a grid in which everything's symmetrical and really nice looking. However, if I don't have more than four items in the directory, the folders don't snap to to the grid like they're supposed to.\nHere's a quick fifteen second vid displaying the issue as well as the Finder settings I've used.\nSo my question is simple: how do I fix/enable snap to grid functionality for directories with four or less items in it?\n\nA: If you select \"Snap to Grid\" from the \"Sort by\" menu and \"None\" from the \"Arrange By\" menu, it'll keep the same grid spacing regardless of the number of items in the folder.  \n\nA: Much of apple's aesthetic design has quirks like this. Things look nice one way on a small scale and look nice in a different way on a large scale. One thing I might offer is that perhaps snap to grid is disabled if there aren't enough files to create a second row. Try resizing your window to allow five items before having to move down. Does the same thing happen? If so I think you're dealing with an inherency of the Yosemite/apple aesthetic. Sorry that it doesn't suit your tastes.

These \"stored windows\" are saved for your current display configuration. \nI don’t use Spaces regularly, but according to the docs for Stay, if you download the app directly from the developer, instead of the Mac App Store, the app does support Spaces: https://cordlessdog.com/stay/documentation/faq/#spaces\nOne tip: if you want all windows for a particular app to always be the same size and position of the current window you have open, use the \"Match all windows\" pattern after you store the window (look up \"Window Title Pattern Matching\" in the website Docs).\n\nA: After some experimentation, I've been able to keep all windows in the proper spaces across unplug/replug by adding 1 extra blank space on my laptop screen.\nWhile plugged in to external monitor, I have #1 on monitor and #2 & 3 on the laptop (call these 1a, 2a, 3a).  #2a is kept blank.\nUpon unplugging, there is some merging and rearranging of the Spaces happening:\n\n1a + 2a -> 1b (This is why I left 2a blank)\n3a -> 2b\n\nEnd result when unplugged is my original stuff which was separated is still separated, I just don't have the extra blank display.\nThere's probably some way to extrapolate this merging behavior with more than 3 displays.\n", "Q: How to get OSX Yosemite outside the Mac App Store I have the following scenario.\n\n\n*\n\n*At work I run an Ubuntu PC machine with fast connection.\n\n*At home I have a Mac without any kind of outside connection (offline)\n\n\nMy question is how do I get the OSX Yosemite offline installer to install it on my home Mac, obviously I can't access the Mac App Store in my Ubuntu machine at work.

And I would like to avoid downgrading if possible. \nEver since I upgraded to OS X Yosemite though, juniper's network connect (vpn client) stopped working. First it just wouldn't launch. I realized that was because of the Java 7 compatibility issue on Yosemite. So I upgraded to the latest Java 8 build (and installed the JDK). \nNow although Network Connect launches it hangs at the \"Establishing Secure Session\" step.

It was still connecting, but disconnecting every couple of minutes. \nIf you have any requirement to have the latest Oracle Java 8.25 running let me know - there are a few steps which may produce mixed results, like: manually downloading and installing the Network Connect Applet (from your secure gateway), always starting the connection from within the Safari browser (instead of from the Applet, as it'll never successfully connect) and, further, inside Safari / Preferences / Security / Allow Plugins > WebSite Settings setting Java / your VPN gateway to \"Run in unsafe mode\" (choose it twice, otherwise it won't get registered).\n\nA: Get your Network Connect from https://vpn.gaikai.com/dana-cached/nc/NetworkConnect.dmg\nThat, along with Faraaz's suggestion of rebooting after\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nIt fixed the problem for me\n\nA: Figured it out.  First downgrade JAVA to Apple 1.6 as mentioned by Joe L. Farina above. \nThat actually does work in some situations, but if your VPN provider only supports an old version of Network Connect then it will continue to hang. \nTo fix that, on the terminal run the following, then restart your computer: \nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nFor some users it might be necessary to do this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6546349\nUpdate: Some folks have been asking what the above command does, and fairly so. \nThe above command basically disables kext signing on your OS X equipment. Kext signing is a security (Code signing) feature, that verifies if drivers and other software installed on your computer have been altered in anyway from what the developer of the application/driver had originally released. Old applications developed for the OS X (pre Yosemite) did not have this feature, since the feature was introduced with Yosemite. It does have a theoretical security risk, but if you know what you are installing and you do it from authentic sources (like the app store or well known developers you trust), then you should be fine. Otherwise refrain.

I have an iPhone 4, and that's not likely to change any time soon (unless I break it). Being a 4, it can only use iOS 7; I can't install iOS 8 on it.\nOn my Mac, I've installed OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Yosemite offered to upgrade to iCloud Drive, BUT: I don't have iOS 8, so my iPhone wouldn't be able to use files in iCloud anymore, right? ...the phone wouldn't be able to use iCloud Drive, right? And Yosemite needs iCloud Drive, so until I upgrade to iCloud Drive, my Mac can't use files in iCloud anymore, right? ...Yosemite can't use the old system?\nSo what should I do? Do I have to choose to use iCloud with either my Mac or my iPhone? Should I go back to Mavericks? Is there something I'm missing, or is there any other way?\n\nA: You are correct. From John Siracusa's extensive OS X 10.10 Yosemite review: (emphasis mine)\n\nUpgrading is not mandatory, but iCloud Drive completely replaces the old “Documents & Data” item in the Yosemite’s iCloud preference pane. Applications like TextEdit and Preview won’t provide access to any form of iCloud document storage in Yosemite until iCloud Drive is enabled. You’ll be prompted to upgrade during the account setup process. If you decline, you can upgrade later by enabling iCloud Drive in the iCloud preference pane.\n\nAnd Apple's KB page, specifically addressing iPhone 4 customers at the end:\n\niPhone 4 customers\niPhone 4 does not support iOS 8 or iCloud Drive. If you upgrade your iCloud account to iCloud Drive, you will not be able to use iCloud with Pages, Numbers, or Keynote on an iPhone 4. You’ll still be able to use the iWork apps on an iPhone 4, but without iCloud.\n\nAs for what you should do, I guess there aren't many counterintuitive answers here: Either get by without iCloud until you get a newer iPhone, or elect to use other syncing services like Dropbox, Box, or SpiderOak.\n\nA: sorry but what difference does it make to upgrade or not to iCloud drive once you install Yosemite?\nI said 'no' to the upgrade when installing Yosemite on my macbook, but changes made on the \"icloud/pages\" documents in the Pages App on my Mac (running Yosemite but NO iCloud Drive) do not appear anyway on my iphone4 ... so what is the advantage of not using iCloud Drive if it does not update anyway??\nAnd iCloud.com isn't accessible either from safari unless you upgrade...\nFor what it seems, the 'old' iCloud is gone, as far as my iphone4 is concerned\n", "Q: If Yosemite is free, why do I have to verify billing info? I am unable to upgrade to Yosemite because when I press the \"Free\" button it takes me to  a page where I must verify my billing info., then when I press done, it gives me \"your payment method was declined\" !!\nSince it is free, why do I have to verify my billing info ?\nand if my account is verified why is it saying declined, does it try to take money out of my account ?\nand how then to install the new OS ?\nNote: my current OS  version is 10.9.5\n\nA: The verification is for your Apple ID for purchases. You can either set the payment option to none if you're from the US or add a credit card to it. This eases the payment option if you plan to buy apps from the store later.\nBut in the case of downloading Yosemite, You will not be charged for anything. \n", "Q: Trying to encrypt external HD .

I need help a soon as possible\n\nA: You can connect it to iTunes and remove the sync option under movies and sync your iPhone 4. This should remove the existing content from the iPhone and clear up space.\n", "Q: Can I remote desktop to another user on the same machine? On my work Mac, which stays physically in my work office, I want to keep my work stuff separate from my personal stuff by using two different user accounts.  I normally stay logged in as the 'work' user.  But I want to have them visible at the same time, since I have a large screen.  I think I could get a nice setup if I could use the built in remote desktop client or a 3rd party VNC client to connect to the login screen of the existing machine, so that I can select a different user.  Or if I could connect as a specific user, even though the physical machine is already logged in as someone else.\nI normally use my system with \"remote management\" mode enabled (not just remote desktop), and I often use a VNC client at home to access my Mac desktop at work.  Although this is not my daily routine.  In this mode the VNC client immediately connects to the existing desktop.  Is there a way I can force this connection to go to the login screen instead?  When I use a VNC client to connect to the existing screen, I can see it trying (you get the kind of infinite regress that you might expect), so the basic connection works.  I just want it to let me select another user.\nEdit:\nI think part of the problem is that the system might be running a VNC server session in the background waiting for me to connect.  It connects to the active session.  It seems to happen either when I have \"remote management\" turned on or just \"screen sharing\".  Using an alternate user in an \"open\" command results in an error about not being able to control your own screen.\nTo be clear, both accounts are on my work computer.  From home I want to connect to my \"work user\" on my work computer.  From my desk at work, logged in as my \"work user\" I want to be able to connect to the \"personal user\" on my work computer.\nI think my real problem is related to what happens on the server side of the connection.  I want the OS to fire up the login window even through there is a user logged in on the main screen/keyboard.   I know that is some circumstances a remote-login user can receive the login screen.  It might be necessary for me to give up the idea of sometimes connecting to the logged-in user and sometimes connecting with a fresh login.  If I can switch completely to the fresh-login mode that would be a start.\nHow does Mac OS decide whether to show the login-screen for a remote connection versus just connecting you to the running desktop?  I thought it was related to having \"remote management\" turned on vs \"screen sharing\".  But with just \"screen sharing\" turned on, I still get the connect-to-existing behavior.\n\nA: You can specify a specific user using the open command in terminal.\nopen vnc://user:password@hostname(or IP)\n\nThis is also achievable through Go Connect to Server ( cmd + k) from the finder and entering vnc://hostname(or IP)\nYou can only have two users running on one machine remotely.\n\nA: To clarify @mindmischief answer, here are the steps to set it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*(optional) Create a new user (e.g. vnc) in Preferences/Users with the password.\n\n*In Preferences/Sharing, enabled Screen Sharing and Remote Login (also Allow access for it).\n\n*Verify that ssh vnc@localhost works.\n\n*Run: ssh -NL 5901:localhost:5900 vnc@localhost (as per this post).\n\n\nNote: You can use different user than vnc. For debug, add -vvv to your ssh command.\nNow open the VNC connection by the following command:\nopen vnc://localhost:5901/\n\n\nA: ARD into your \"work account\" and then do the following on the remote computer to open a Screen Sharing window to your \"personal account\" on the same remote computer.\nCreate an SSH tunnel.  It works for me using 10.9.\nEnable Remote Login (SSH) in System Preferences > Sharing, and in Terminal run:\nssh -NL 5901:localhost:5900 localhost\n\nFinally, use Screen Sharing to connect to localhost:5901 (instead of the default port 5900).   Instead of port 5901 you can use a much higher port that isn't in use by anything else.\nThe Screen Sharing application is located here: /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app\n\nA: Nowadays this works out of the box with the built-in “Screen Sharing” feature (which is just a built-in VNC server).\nGo to “System Preferences → Sharing” and enable “Screen Sharing” for all users. Now each user account will be able to connect using any VNC client and log into their own session.\n\nA: I can confirm that this is still working on Big Sur, no issues, but you must set up the SSH tunnel per the top answer above and then use screen sharing for VNC (Apple's built-in screen share app works better than VNC, IMHO).\nFailure to set up SSH tunnel throws an error \"You Cannot Control Your Own Screen\".\n", "Q: Purchasing a Mac Mini with Future Compatibility in Mind I am contemplating purchasing a mac mini. However, now that Apple has just released newer models of the mac minis, I find myself a bit confused.\nBasically, my requirements are: A mac to learn and develop ios apps, within a $700 budget.\nApple hardware is expensive and because I will also need to purchase an iPhone and iPad, I want to ensure that if I buy a Mac Mini it should at least last me for 3-4 years (i.e., support iOS development for 3-4 years) with only the occasional RAM or HD upgrades needed.\nMy doubts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it prudent to buy the cheaper 2012 Mac Mini model, and just upgrade the RAM and HD, rather than opting for the 2014 mac mini? (I do not see any significant differences in the hardware between the 2012 and 2014 model except for the better processor and integrated graphic support.)\n\n*The newer 2014 Mac Minis come with the 4th generation (Haswell) intel processors, while the 2012 mac mini models come with older i5 and i7 processors. Seeing that the lowest specs of the 2014 mac mini is 1.4 Ghz i5, how much weight should be given to the processor considering future compatibility when it comes to future mac OS X releases?\n\n*How is apple's hardware support for older models, in general?\n\nA: *\n\n*Buy the \"Basic\" (as they call it in Apple Store) 2012 Mac mini and replace HD and RAM yourself is the most economical way. It's also the power user move.\n\n\na) While leaving the factory HD in place, you can put in a second drive such as a SSD at where the optical bay used to be. You can dual boot two OS X installations. One can be the daily OS, the other 1) as extra storage for less frequented files, 2) as Time Machine backup location, and 3) as beefed-up Recovery Mode if the primary fails. I don't know if you can put a 2nd drive into the 2014 model.\nb) Dual drive and merge them into your own fusion drive.\nc) Upgrade to a 3rd-party 16 GB RAM. The price cannot be cheaper given the amount of time it has been out in the market.\n\n\n*Haswell's raison is saving energy. It makes a lot of sense on MBP and MBA. And 2014 Mac mini DOES use less power than the 2012 model, but that's a moot point.\n\n\nCompatibility is less concerning if you consider performance. An iPhone 4 is compatible with iOS 7, but that's not preferable, and a 4S can technically run iOS 8 but only sluggishly and without many features. You COULD install Yosemite on 2009 Mac mini, but would you do it?\n\n\n*Great. I fixed/tweaked my MBP, Mac mini, and MBA for 4 years now without ever going to the genius bar, hat in hand. So apple's support did a great job of staying out of my way. I'm serious. When I had a Dell, I chose to add years to my warranty because the company is the the only place you can turn to. Because apple has sold so many and kept its lines simple, there ought to be somebody out there doing what you're doing.\n\n\nI don't know if you agree that Apple has placed Mac mini into that peculiar spot in its line-up: iPod Touch is the thing that's not an iPhone; iPad mini (2014) is that thing that is not a iPhone 6 Plus. Mac Mini is the thing that is not a Mac Pro. Apple's not going to be pushing the boundaries with it. That's my guess.\n", "Q: Fixing a Windows partition boot using OS X tools I've got a triple boot system on my Early 2013 Mac Book Pro: OS X, Windows 7 and Ubuntu. I'm using rEFInd as my boot manager. My Windows install boots using legacy BIOS boot, and OS X and Ubuntu boot with native EFI boot.\nEverything has been working until I updated to OS X Yosemite. That broke my Windows: \n\n\"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\"\n\nI guess I should've backed the boot sector up before updating, but it's too late now! Since the Windows boots in BIOS mode, it reads the hybrid MBR and indeed, the Windows partition was not flagged as bootable. After I flagged it bootable with fdisk, the message changed to:\n\n\"Missing operating system\"\n\nI have checked the MBR with fdisk, and GPT with gdisk that and are indeed compatible and in sync. After hours of googling and trying everything, I finally realised what the problem was:\nI had some weeks earlier resized the Windows partition, by shrinking the OS X partition in OS X, and then, using a certain Windows software, growing the Windows partition to accommodate the new free space that now lied before the Windows partition. It now seems that that program updated ONLY MBR: from GPT viewpoint there is some unpartitioned space before the Windows partition, and from MBR viewpoint that space is used by Windows.\nHowever, when installing Yosemite, it synced the hybrid MBR to comply with the GPT, marking the upper section of the Windows partition as free space. That \"free space\", of course contains the Windows bootloader and a bunch of data!\nMy question is, is there any way to scan the seemingly unpartitioned portion of the disk, and determine the first sector of the Windows partition? I guess that is possible, but I need the right tools for that.\nFor information, here is my GPT data:\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition\n   2          409640       731723959   348.7 GiB   AF05  Macintosh HD\n   3       731723960       732993495   619.9 MiB   AB00  Recovery HD\n   4       799528960       906948607   51.2 GiB    0700  WINDOWS 1\n   5       906948608       977104895   33.5 GiB    0700  UBUNTU\n\nand the data from protective/hybrid MBR:\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AC 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  731314320] <Unknown ID>\n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 731723960 -    1269536] Darwin Boot \n*4: 0C 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 732993496 -  173955112] Win95 FAT32L\n\nNote that there is a 66535465 sector, 31.7 GiB gap before the 51.2 GiB Windows partition. When Windows worked, it saw its partition as roughly 80 GiB partition. So, the \"real\" start of that Windows partition lies somewhere inisde that gap. How to scan it out?\n\nA: I'll post this as an answer, even though it didn't fix my problem – this was a lost case in the end. Aftermath: I dd'ed a backup of the Windows partition to my OS X partition:\nsudo dd bs=512 if=/dev/disk0 of=windows_backup skip=732993496 count=173955112\n\nNow I had a 80 gig hex dump which I could examine safely. I used a hex editor to search for all kinds of metadata:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"NTFS\" (encoded in ASCII) which starts a NTFS volume.\n\n*\"FILE\" (encoded in ASCII) which starts a file entry record in the $MFT or master file table in NTFS.\n\n*NTFS system file names (like \"MFT\", tried with little-endian UTF-16 and ASCII)\n\n\n... and so on. But without success. I was able to find all kinds of data from the dump, but all the metadata, including the boot record (the first sector of the volume), the $Boot file (the first 15 sectors after the boot record), the $MFT file which keeps record of all the files on the file system, were gone.\nThe thing that baffles me that I couldn't even find $MFTMirr file, which is the backup file of the metadata files and stored halfway of the volume.\nI was able to find a backup of the boot sector from its standard location, the last sector of the volume. However, the data was old, from the era before resizing the volume. The boot sector has stored the offset of the $MFT file metadata file, but inspecting the references was moot, there was nothing of value there.\nIn the end, I concluded that the volume was totally borked. The moral of the story? Hybrid Master Boot Record is evil. Also, it seems that the program that resized the volume did a subpar job, failing to update some of the metadata.\n", "Q: How to pause music while playing video in Keynote?

One time, I  accidentally  pulled out the charger and it turned off. It was not my first time so I just didn't worry. But when I plugged it back and turned on the laptop, it just got stuck at the gray screen with the Apple logo, the wheel, and a loading bar.

For pretty much the whole time I have been running it at the scaled 1680 x 1050 resolution (1 up from the \"best for retina\" resolution).\nAfter randomly playing around with the different resolution, I came to notice that the \"best for retina\" display is in fact better quality to my eye (so much so that its almost painful to use any of the scaled resolutions now):\nI tested this by browsing and reading text at the two different resolutions, making sure to zoom to accommodate for size difference. I even tested it out reading smaller text on the higher scaled resolution with the same outcome.  The \"best for retina\" (1440 x 900) appears less fuzzy and significantly reduces eye strain.\nMy question is (aside from wondering if anybody else has noticed this): is there a technical reason that could account for what I am seeing?\n\nA: Best for retina = every on-screen pixel is represented by four pixels on the display (1440 x 900 displayed on 2880 x 1800 pixels)\nMore space = every on-screen pixel is represented by 1.8 pixels on the display. (1920 x 1200 displayed on 2880 x 1800 pixels)\nIn between these two settings every on-screen pixel is represented by an uneven number of pixels on the display. Because there is no such thing as half a pixel, the drawing is not exact so there will be fuzziness. But the physical pixels on the retina display are supposed to smaller than we can perceive from a normal viewing distance so most people cannot notice it.\nMaybe you are sitting closer to the screen than most people do. Maybe you are just perceiving a difference that is not really there. Maybe your text zooming is doing something weird. Or maybe you just have sharper eyes than most and are more sensitive to fuzziness.\n", "Q: Could the recently announced Mac Minis power a theoretical 5K Retina display?

Since /Application/***.app/Contents/Info.plist is live-fetched, an user no longer need to reset LaunchServices for related changes to appear. This is my conjecture.\nHowever, this causes a problem for me. I create keyboard shortcut through applescript or BetterTouchTool to invoke Menu Bar -> File -> Open With -> Certain App.\nThis way I programed FN+SHIFT+1 to open the file with TextMate, FN+SHIFT+2 for Writer Pro, etc.\nThe 1) need for cursor over \"Open With\" to trigger fetch, and 2) the delay in fetching cause my scripts to be invalid.\nI was able to verify this theory by: 1) Right clicking a file, 1) Hover over \"Open With\" entry, 3) Wait for the submenu to fetch, 4) Click outside the Context Menu to have it disappear, 5) and invoke the keyboard shortcut.\nAnd the shortcut worked.\nSo these are my questions:\n1) Obviously, can I revert to pre-Yosemite behavior?\n2) Does anyone have clever ways to open a file type with multiple apps on demand cleanly and efficiently?\nUPDATE:\nSo far, I have one workaround, that is to create a Automator Service. Here is an example with TextMate:\n\nI can run this without delay through 1) Menubar -> Finder -> Services -> Open With TextMate, 2) top level of the context menu, or 3) a keyboard shortcut if I choose to.\n\nThis comes with two caveats:\n1) The items received into the service have to be in the broadest definition possible, e.g. files and folders. Finder doesn't recognized, for example, .plist files as documents. If you set the service to only receive documents, Open With TextMate would not show up when you want to use it on a .plist file.\n2) Because of (1), this menu entry shows up on every item in Finder. It's innocuous enough if there is only one or two custom entries. If there is six or seven, this group of items is going to take over the context menu. \n\nA: I had a similar issue and the 'Fetching...' was taking many seconds. I just reset Launch Services with the following command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed -r -f -v -domain local -domain user -domain system\n\n\nA: After things settled down (spotlight indexing is complete, a few reboots, using different user names), things have settled down and the \"fetching\" delay has gone away and the popup menu opens in less than 2 seconds are so.  But some conditions (like mounting new disks) seem to make the delay increase again.\nResetting Launch Services from first comment DOES work, if the delay increases (/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed -r -f -v -domain local -domain user -domain system).  While the command executes, you can see in the Console\n\nLaunchServices: Begin database seeding\"\n\nand\n\n\"... Completed database seeding\"\n\nSometimes it takes a whole minute to reset/rebuild! There are also several error messages in the terminal window when the command executes (e.g., registering Livecode application's community edition).\nPutting the reset launch services command in something like Lingon and running it every so often may be way to go until Apple fixes the delay in some future update.\n\nA: I noticed this when I have a Time Machine disk attached that has not been used in a while.  If the disk is asleep and I right-click, I see \"Fetching\" in the contextual menu.  Then I hear the HDD wake up, spin for a second, and the \"Open With\" menu is finally populated.\nWhen I don't have the external drive attached, I don't see this behavior.\n", "Q: Is the MacBook Pro Retina (Old Version) meant to come with an extension cable?

To my Windows leaning understanding I could understand this with a major version increment but I don't get understand why a minor version number update would be such an issue.\nOne particular issue for me has been with Parallels Desktop.  For the last few months my installation of Parallels has been telling me to upgrade from version 8 to version 10 as version 8 is \"incompatible\" with Yosemity and \"will not work\".\nThere are posts from Parallels employees on their own support forum stating this repeatedly to users as well as the application offering a dialog on application launch also repeating this message.\nOne of their support staff even stated in a post that when they tried it in their labs the VM software simply wouldn't even launch.\nWell, yesterday I updated to Yosemity and launched Parallels 8 and ran my VM without any issues.\nI don't know about other countries but this is completely illegal marketing practices in the UK.  They have so clearly told me that what I did would categorically not work when in fact it did.  I have saved myself a £35 upgrade by all accounts.\nParallels customers are complaining about the upgrade cycle and leaving the Parallels platform in droves by all accounts and switching to the free Virtual Box and after this experience I am certainly not giving them any more of my cash.\nIt seems that many vendors talk about a minor OSX version increment like it's a completely different OS and application model under the hood which to my mind just doesn't make sense.\nSince I'm yet to take up Mac software development with any real world software I'm not aware of what these issues might be and now that I feel I have been completely mislead by Parallels I'm feeling particularly annoyed that I could have spent £35 on a software update based on what appears to be lies.\nWhat are these potential incompatibilities?  Obviously new features of the OS wont by used by \"old\" software but to be told that my apps won't even launch when in fact they do is seriously questionable business practices and is even illegal in my country.\n\nA: To provide an insight into the API level changes between OS X versions, Apple's What's New in OS X developer document is useful.\nThe deprecated framework and function lists can be extensive between 10.x releases:\n\nDeprecated Frameworks and APIs\nPeriodically, Apple adds deprecation macros to APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. When a deprecation occurs, it is not an immediate end of life for the specified API. Instead, it is the beginning of a grace period for transitioning from that API and to newer and more modern replacements. Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable in the system for a reasonable time past the release in which they were deprecated. However, active development on them ceases, and the APIs receive only minor changes to accommodate security patches or to fix other critical bugs. Deprecated APIs may be removed entirely from a future version of the operating system.\nAs a developer, avoid using deprecated APIs in your code as soon as possible. At a minimum, new code you write should never use deprecated APIs. And if your existing code uses deprecated APIs, update that code as soon as possible. Fortunately, the compiler generates warnings whenever it spots the use of a deprecated API in your code. You can use those warnings to track down and remove all references to those APIs.\n\n\nA: For clarification, Apple's 'point' releases are the equivalent of Windows' major updates...\n10.9 to 10.10 is as big a change as Windows 7 to 8. \nApple has always had a lot harder approach to backwards compatibility. They want you on the latest & greatest & don't support older OSes for very long at all, \"Last 3\" would be about maximum for even security updates.\niOS is even stricter, they stopped signing iOS 7 within a week of iOS 8 being released, for any hardware that is capable of running 8.\nWindow's backwards compatibility is beleaguered by an ever-increasing legacy of .net & C libs, scattered around even a current Windows machine.\nApple says, keep up or fall behind. \nWithout in any way defending Parallels - did you actually investigate what their incompatibility issue was? The latest official announcement I can see from them was July, long before the final release of Yosemite; maybe the situation changed in later betas.  \n", "Q: Disable font anti aliasing in Firefox in OSX?

Unlike so many of the other Continuity features, this one looks like it should work fine even if you’re using an iPhone 4S with an iMac or MacBook Pro from 2007.\nGiven what we know about how it works and about other features being added to iOS 8, the ability to take and make phone calls from a Mac or iPad is likely an extension of the voice over IP (VoIP) capabilities that power FaceTime Audio in iOS 7 and OS X 10.9.2. Rather than sending voice over the Internet between two Apple devices, it appears to be communicating between two devices on your local network to deliver voice calls.\n\n", "Q: Can't answer my phone call with yosemite Whenever a phone call comes in I can answer it on my iPad but not on my macbook(2008) running yosemite.\nI also can't call my contacts from my contact list.\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nA: Handoff only works with fairly recent Macs that support Bluetooth 4.0.\nYou can check whether Handoff is supported in About this Mac -> System Report...\nMy 2011 Macbook Pro doesn't have Bluetooth 4.0, so no Handoff for me either.\n\n\nA: I haven't found a definitive list of compatible machines yet, but based on reviews I would say your Macbook is too old to support it.  \nSeveral sites are claiming that it works on a 2012 model but not 2011.\n", "Q: How to keep messages after deactivating imessage?

As a temporary workaround to this bug, you must disable Parental Controls on the problematic accounts.\nIf the problem still persists after removing the Parental Controls using Settings, you may need to take an extra step to be sure the managed account status has been cleared. Simply grant admin rights to the problem accounts and then revoke them. Admin accounts can't also be managed accounts so this clears any leftover settings.\n\nA: Not sure if its the same problem, but on an account with parental controls, upgraded from Mavericks from Yosemite, I can no longer access HTTPS (SSL) websites. I can access HTTP websites until I access a HTTPS website. Once an SSL website is attempted, all communication ceases.\nI tried lots of combinations. I'm also running Little Snitch, but I disabled it. Other accounts work fine. Disabling parental controls did the trick. \nNote that now-a-days, Google by default uses SSL for all its queries, even the home page redirects to https://google.com\n", "Q: Mavericks and Yosemite marks mails in multiple accounts as read I have 2 accounts configured in my Mac mail. alex@ and orders@\nIf for example I receive an e-mail with TO: alex@ and CC: orders@ it will go to both e-mail addresses.

I just need to mark as read the e-mail I read from the specific email account, not from all of them.\n\nA: Strictly speaking, You have read it.\nI've noticed recently that if I get duplicate emails to 2 accounts, Mail is actually appearing to merge them into one email [at a user-level anyway, idk about behind the scenes]\nI know of no way round this, so maybe try using Flags instead of the 'read' indicator. More work, but more reliable.\n\nA: Unless you do some huge digging in the menus, I don't think you can fix this. If you \"mark as read\" as a workaround, the e-mail will likely be marked as read on both accounts.\n\nA: The e-mail you receives has an Unique Identifier. They're the same for both as it's the \"same email\".\nThere's nothing you can do about this as Mail marks this ID as read.\nForward it yourself is an option, it will be a new UID.\n\nA: Go to Mail > Preferences > Viewing \nThen uncheck “Include related messages”.\n", "Q: Will encrypting hard drive reduce disk size? I have a 1TB harddisk that has 20GB space left. I want to encrypt this disk. Will encryption take up more space, and if so, is there an estimate, a percentage or something how much it will cost?\n\nA: The chances are you don't have enough free space on it to allow it to encrypt at all; if it does work it will be horrendously slow.\nYou should always leave at least 10% free space on a hard drive, preferably 15%\nEncryption is not by default also compression; the resulting file size may be no different.\nFor compression, if the data is predominantly 'text' then compression will save space; if it is music, pictures or video it will save none.\n\nA: When I open Diskutility, I see a change for partitions that are encrypted. They each have two entries, a parent and child. The parent is the normal partition, and inside is the encrypted child partition. As the encryption is always done by the OS, it is software encryption. \nThe resulting encrypted child partition is smaller than the parent. As I had several encrypted partitions, I was able to compare them using the numbers in Diskutility. I can only give you the numbers from this one example, so I don't know if they are similar on other systems. For this computer, encryption takes 320MB data. One partition (root) uses 4KB less for encryption. Disk Utility reports for the parent root partition that 4096 Bytes are free. The other parent partitions have 0 bytes free. Why this is - I have no idea. \nBelow you see the data in bytes for all three partitions: 150GB, 300GB, 850GB. \n\n(A)Partition   (B) Parent      (C) Child      (D) Difference  (E) MB\n1 (root)       149484212224    149148663808   335548416       320.00390625\n2 (external)   300060016640    299724464128   335552512       320.0078125\n3              849726693376    849391140864   335552512       320.0078125\n\nDifference D2 - D1\n335552512 - 335548416 = 4096 = 4KB\n\nAs I use 256 bit encryption, these numbers may be different for 128 bit.

By what I've already read, I know that if you have purchased an app in the Mac App Store with the account X, then you can update it only by logging into X. Now the question that arises is: What if the downloaded app is free, does the same rule apply or not?\n\nA: Yes, the same principle applies. For Apple, it is a purchased product, though in one case the price was $0.\nSo it's not transferable from account to account. As a developer, I know one normal case that is: the app is free for one day. Then the app turns paid. If a user could transfer to another account, then it would be a problem for the dev since it may be transferred to anyone. \n", "Q: IOS 8.0.2 Calendar on iPhone 5 not syncing with MS Exchange properly Since I upgraded my iPhone 5 to iOS 8.0.2 I have started having issues with the calendar syncing through Microsoft Exchange.

In Mavericks, I was able to scroll through PDFs in Skim by pressing the up/down arrow keys, with the down arrow navigating to later pages in the document, and the up arrow navigating to earlier pages. In Yosemite, it appears that the up and down arrow keys have reversed when viewing a document in either \"single page\" or \"two pages\" mode (not continuous); now, the up arrow goes to later pages, and the down arrow to earlier pages. Is this a Skim-only change, or is the change more system-wide? If it's system-wide, is there a way to change it back to the Mavericks behavior?\nEdit: It seems that some people aren't able to reproduce this, so it might be a particular choice of settings that is causing this strange behavior.\n\nA: According to the author of Skim, there is a bug in Yosemite that swapped the up and down arrow keys. Some versions of Skim had the fix, and the author later decided to remove it. In the newest version of Skim, 1.4.12, the author re-added the workaround. From the changelog:\nReinsert workaround for Page Up/Page Down bug Apple refuses to fix\n\n", "Q: Pinning the Dock to a Corner in Yosemite/El Capitan In Mavericks and prior, one could use the following commands to pin the dock to either the top or bottom corner of the screen, if the dock was placed left/right, or to the left/right corners if the dock was placed at the bottom, by using the following commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string start\n\nor\ndefaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string end\n\nThis is followed by killall Dock to restart the Dock. Now, in Yosemite, it appears that this option has been removed. Is there no way to get back this functionality in Yosemite?\nUpdate: This is still not possible in El Capitan. Very disappointed in Apple.\n\nA: I filed bug #18701500 on this problem with http://bugreporter.apple.com/ \nMy bug was closed by Apple Engineering as a duplicate of bug #16814560, which is still marked as open.\nAlthough Apple does not permit public viewing of the bug database—I cannot see the details on the bug that they have closed it in favor of—and thus you cannot verify my statements, this is proof to me that there is currently no solution to this problem.\n\nA: Looks like this isn't possible as shown here.

No boot & can't erase I recently upgraded to Yosemite, enabled FileVault and foolishly enabled TRIM (had no idea it wasn't supported).\nUpon restart, my machine gets the grey screen with the crossed-out circle of death.\nAfter figuring out what happened, I then attempted to restore from a Time Machine backup (10.9).  The backup failed almost immediately, but did manage to erase the HD (or at least the partition is gone).\nNow I'm completely stuck.  Disk Utility can see this drive, but cannot erase or re-partition it.  The drive isn't mounted so I cannot access it with Terminal (at least with my level of knowledge).  cd /Volumes/mydrive doesn't work - no such directory.\nI have re-installed Yosemite on my second hard drive and booted from there.  I tried Disk Utility again and I still have no options available to erase or partition my original disk, although it is there.\nCan anyone help me get my original disk back into functioning form?  If I can just get the disk erased and partitioned, I can load my Time Machine backup and be off to the races.  Thanks!\n\nA: A clean install is not necessary, you simply need to reconfigure your NVRAM (nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1) to disable the kext signing requirement for OS X.

I tried to use\"unidentified\" and it worked: diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ unidentified disk0 erased the disk and made available for OSX installation.\n\nA: Same problem here. I have Macbook Pro, 15 inch, 2009 model. Was on Maverick, upgraded carefully (prepped and cleaned). Upgrade went fine, was able to use it a day, then no boot. I had installed an OWC SSD inside, put in a couple of years ago, and trim enabled. On trying to start, gray screen, no icon. Here is what I tried (along with help from Apple):\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting pram.\n\n*Resetting power manager.\n\n*Starting with command/R to access recovery volume.\n\n*Using external boot backup, USB port, and holding down option key.\n\n*Attempting to access internet archive (not sure right word) by using command/option/R.\n\n*Starting from an install disk in the optical drive.\n\n\nNone of this was successful. Every attempt resulted ONLY in a gray screen.\nFinally, giving up after trying the optical drive, restarted holding down the trackpad to eject the CD. This happened, disk came out, and suddenly the drive came to life again. I don't know if this was chance or somehow holding the trackpad down had an effect. \nAfter the drive back again, I tried ALL the steps that Cindori suggested to inactivate trim and none of the steps had any effect whatsoever. So don't know if this is going to be a continuing problem or not as I can't inactivate trim. I did trash Trim Enabler and cleaned caches and did maintenance with Onyx so hopefully will not be a continuing problem.\nIn any case, has taken a few days to deal with so far.\n", "Q: Increasing USB port Power Output I have a new (2013) 15\" Macbook Pro.\nThe USB port provides 500mA which is not good enough for many devices I use (Hard Drive, 3G Dongle...)\nReading this article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049 it seems that these ports are capable of delivering more power, but it's limited to Apple products.\nIs it possible to hack the mac, and change this default value (to something like 900mA?)\n\nA: Apple USB 3.0 ports will output up to 1100mA if requested, USB 2.0 is limited to 500mA\nYou can check the current requirements for any attached device in Apple Menu > About this Mac > More Info (later macOS versions now labelled 'System Report…')... USB\nI only have USB 2.0 ports on this machine, but see pic...\n\n\nA: Thunderbolt or USB hub\nYou can fix this by using a powered USB hub. This way you do not have to modify your mac.\nThis Belking 4-Port USB hub for example.\n\nThe only negative, you need a power socket.\nAnother fix is to use a Thunderbolt hub, like the Matrox DS1. This is a hub with Thunderbolt input, needs no additional power, and outputs all sorts of IO, including USB 3.\n\n\nA: Another possible solution, that avoids any sort of hacking, would be to use a USB-Y cable. These cables provide two usb connectors that plug into your laptop and merge to a single cable that's plugged into your external device, therefore pulling current from two usb ports on your laptop. Many external HD's come with these, they're inexpensive, and do the job. See http://www.toshiba.com/us/accessories/Cables-Adapters/Cables/USB/BA-82010 for an example. \n\nA: \nThe USB port provides 500mA which is not good enough for many devices I use (Hard Drive, 3G Dongle...)\n\nThe USB 3.x ports on Apple computers are able to supply more than 500 mA.  This can be demonstrated by plugging in an iPhone and see the computer report in System Information that it is supplying 12 watts.  The ability of the port to supply power doesn't change with what is plugged into it.\n\nReading this article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049 it seems that these ports are capable of delivering more power, but it's limited to Apple products.\n\nThe power the port can supply is not limited by what is plugged in.  This document is not intended for a highly technical audience so it's in a way lying by omission.\n\nIs it possible to hack the mac, and change this default value (to something like 900mA?)\n\nMuch of this default behavior is written in the device, not the host.  And Apple computers built after iPods started using USB for charging (2005 or there about) will provide at least 1500 mA from their USB ports.\nYou don't have to \"hack\" anything for it to provide 900 mA to a USB device.  The USB 2.0 and USB 3.x spec allows for up to 1500 mA to devices.  Apple computers since 2012 or so were built to provide 2400 mA from USB.  Apple isn't doing anything \"sneaky\" or out of spec in providing this extra current from USB ports to Apple iDevices.  They use the USB-PD and USB-BC protocols for this, and other USB devices can safely use this power too if they use the same protocol.\nFew USB devices will require more than 900 mA from a USB host because for a number of reasons few USB hosts provide more than 900 mA.  Apple computers will happily provide this much power without any \"hack\".  Because this budgeting of power relies as much on the device as on the host there's ways to get more power by \"hacks\" to the device.  That's assuming one desires well behaved USB devices.  It's possible, and trivial, to create a device that will take 12 watts from a USB port like an iPhone would but without asking nicely first like an iPhone would.\n", "Q: update OSX Yosemite & cksum mismatch After OSX Update -> Yosemite:\nNo option to login and run the system.\nVia Firewire (T) and Diskutils && Diskwarrior:\n\"Unvalid Disk-Label @ 499239710720: cksum mismatch\"\nDiskwarrior: no option to rebuild\nDiskutills: Unvalid Disk-Label @ 499239710720: cksum mismatch\nWhat could I do to reboot and rerun the machine?

I don't pin all of them permanently because that would reduce dock icon size.\nWhen I drag a running app to a place I want it to be, the app is auto-pinned. I have to right-click and unpin the app from Dock.\nI wonder if anyone knows how to stop letting Dock auto-pin apps.\n\nA: There is no setting for this; any item on the dock that you move gets pinned to the dock. Locking the Dock's content does prevent items from being pinned, but it also prevents items from being moved/rearranged.\nYou could download an alternative dock replacement that looks and acts like the OS X Dock (there are a few) and hide the real Dock, but that's about it. It may be possible to somehow watch the Dock for newly pinned items and unpin them every 60 seconds or something... but that's probably more hassle than it's worth.

I have upgraded to Yosemite and iOS8.02 on all my devices, including a MacBook Pro, an iPad2, an iPad Mini, and an iPhone 5c.\nI understand that one can use iCloud Drive to share documents produced by any of the iWork apps and also some third-party apps that have been specifically upgraded to use iCloud drive (such as the Readdle suite of apps and Day One).\nBut, what about the other third-party apps that have not been specifically upgraded? Can files from these apps also be shared on iCloud Drive? \nI don't use Pages, Numbers, and Keynote all that much.  In fact, I prefer Microsoft Office for Mac.  And I have a lot of third-party apps I use a lot more often than any of the former.  And, it does not seem to me that all that many of the third-party apps have been specifically prepared to accommodate iCloud drive.\nUnless I am missing something, it would seem to me that it is not necessary for me to upgrade to iCloud drive.  Do you have any advice or comments about this?  Is there anywhere where I might find a list of third-party apps now set up for iCloud Drive?\n\nA: To take advantages of iCloud Drive, the third-party apps need to implement the Document Provider Extension so you can share those files and send them to iCloud Drive. I’ve explained it in one of the post I’ve written:\n\nNot to confuse document provider extension with share extension where you can only send and upload selected files, document provider extension provides more options to export, import, open, and move files between document storage providers.\nThe basic functionality each document provider extension supports is export and import. It lets the extension to export or import the files to destination path.

Hope this works.\n\nA: Dave Meehan's technique worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off the keyboard by holding down the power button for at least 3 seconds\n\n*Click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar\n\n*Click on “Set Up Bluetooth Device” or “Open Bluetooth Preferences”\n\n*urn on the keyboard by holding down the power button, but do not let go of the power button. It must be kept held down through the entire process.\n\n*The Setup Assistant will find the keyboard, so click the name of the keyboard, and then click on “Continue”. Make sure you are still holding the power button down.\n\n*You will be prompted for the Pairing Code. You can now release the power button, type the pairing code on the keyboard and then press return. There will be a slight delay whilst the pairing completes (a few seconds)\n\n*The keyboard will now be Paired.\n\n\nSo just to clarify, the trick is to continually hold down the power button.\n", "Q: Deleting formula sources without destroying formula output, using Numbers for Mac I would like to delete the source column for a formula in Numbers 3.2.2, without destroying values in the formula's output column. Specifically, I have a column of \"Last, First\" names, which I parse by comma and output to two separate columns, \"Last\" and \"First\". How can I delete the \"Last, First\" column without destroying the output values in the \"Last\" and \"First\" columns?\nAn image of the current state of things is shown in the link after this paragraph. The formula used to generate the First Name column is shown for the \"Example, A\" entry. I'd like to lock the output column's values in place, such that they no longer draw on the source column, \"Full Name\". \n\nA: *\n\n*Select the columns with the data that you want to preserve.\n\n*Choose Copy from the Edit menu (or hit Command ⌘+C).\n\n*Choose Paste Formula Results from the Edit menu (or hit Shift ⇧+Command ⌘+V).\n\n\nYou should end up with just the results of the formula.\n", "Q: Yosemite three-finger lookup not working I have enabled the three-finger lookup, but it is not working since I upgrade to Yosemite.

Just quit Scroll Reverser.\n\nA: The problem is with force touch if you have one of the new macbook pro - if it's on force touch under trackpad -> point and click -> Lookup and data detectors then change it to tap three fingers and it should work. \n\nA: Have you tried looking into System Preferences > Trackpad? I can't tell if you are referring to Mission Control swipe up with three fingers, but that's definitely still under the menu in trackpad and can be enabled. \n\nA: I had a similar issue and used these two commands to disable and then re-enable bluetooth. Seemed to revive my issues. \nHowever I have noticed that 3-finger lookup works in some applications and not in others.

If you download the latest driver software from http://madcatz.com/downloads/ for Mavericks (OS X 10.9) it fixes the problem. You will have to restart your computer in the process.\n\nA: I reached out to MadCatz support and they have a workaround to get the Mavericks drivers working in Yosemite:\n\nGo to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Unlock to\n  make changes\nIn the list \"Allow the apps below to control your computer\" ticked the\n  following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MadCatzSmartTechnology\n  \n*Mad Catz Editor”\n  \n\n\nA: For me the same with a Logitech MX connected to a unifying receiver.

Spotlight works fine but Finder search just gives me a blank window with a spinning ball.\nI've tried reindexing and I've also tried deleting Spotlight's .plist file. I restart my MacBook Pro after doing either. Finder search will work for one or two queries and stop again. I don't know what else I can do.\n\n\nA: Has your spotlight been botched? IN short, finder relies on spotlight to find things quickly.\nThis will take a while (5 or so mins) and make your Mac go into \"jump-jet\" mode with the fans, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drop to terminal\n\n*type in sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100\n\n*then sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V200\n\n*then sudo mdutil -i off /\n\n*then sudo mdutil -i on /\n\n*finally sudo mdutil -E /\nBasically in sport, it resets spotlight and tells it to reindex EVERYTHING it normally should do on your \"Macintosh HD\". (Everything unless you've previously added entries to the privacy list)\nAs I said before, it'll make your fans go crazy for a while, but this is expected.\nAfter that, all should be great! :)\n\nA: I saw this behavior and... you know what... it's really unexplainable.  I don't have a root cause (obviously) but I did resolve the problem in this way (below).  I also leave a note below but I am unsure if it relates directly as to why the finder started to show results when I would search.\nIn general, my finder would not display any files when I opened it up and tried to make a search.  Here is a picture for discussion:\n\nWhat I noticed is that when I switched the button that I point to with to #2 (marked in the picture), it would show results, but if I switched to the button that I point to in #1, there would be no results.\nI kept closing Finder and opening it over and over, swapping between 1 and 2.  Eventually all of the different file display methods, (1, 2 and the other 2) would display results correctly when I searched for something.\nI am unsure if the OS was still indexing, or there's truly a stupid bug.  Check the \"Note\" below, because it may be related.\nNote: this may not be related, but I mention it anyways... before I started playing with the Finder search, I disabled \"Search Suggestions\" and \"Bing Web Search\" by unchecking them under: System Preferences > Spotlights > Search Results.\nI don't want my laptop to query the internet and use spotlight (And BING for that matter) to find things for me, if I want to make a search, i'll go to google.com.\n\nA: A few days ago, the next time I started my MBP after installing Yosemite I had an issue with Finder and an existing folder.\nWhen OS X came up I was immediately presented with a window that asked me where I wanted the linked folder to OneDrive to be created at, but it had already been created under Mavericks weeks before. I could see that OneDrive was still displayed in Finder's sidebar and checked whether the folder for OneDrive was still there in my home folder, and it was. Anyway, I went through the options presented by this window and when it came to re-creating the folder in my home folder I responded yes, and it replied that the folder already existed so I cancelled the window and nothing untoward has happened since.\nNote that I also have GoogleDrive linked in the same way for synchronising but Finder has not had a problem with this.\n", "Q: iTunes new song notifications: how to turn off when using miniplayer?

It places one when I use the shortcut, but I can't use my mouse to guide where it goes.\n\nA: I spoke with Apple support and was informed that it's a bug in the initial release 10.10 build (14A389). It's not yet clear if the 10.10.1 (14B25) update has fixed this bug.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but I figured out, that I could copy a version of the old Preview app (verison 7) from a friend who hadn't upgraded, and install it on my computer, and now it works like a charm. \n", "Q: Change color of desktop font (Yosemite) Tinkertool took care of most of the too-small fonts (are any Apple designers over 40?), but the white text on my preferred light desktop is bad. Linux GTX has a rather tricky file to hand-edit to fix a similar bad default. Does Yosemite have any well-hidden way of changing the desktop icon font color?\n\nA: As far as I know, it is not possible to change the color of the system font. The system graphic interface files are under the license protection of Apple's user agreement and they are well guarded with encryptions. This also results in the lack of capacity of turning off full screen animation, and other unfortunate unique OSX graphic interface design features and behaviors.\n\nA: This doesn't do exactly what you want, but it might make the colors more bearable.\nTry this:\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility > Display and play around with Invert Colors and  Enhance Contrast options.\nIf you want to achieve the effect of making your desktop font black, you can try turning on the Invert Colors and Use Gray Scale options.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nI would recommend a better workaround, however. I believe the reason your white font looks bad is because you have your background set to something light. I had a similar issue too until I set my background to something more neutral. Try setting it to a solid color like a shade of brown, or a dull medium blue. Of course, dark grey or black would also work, but I personally don't like the colorless, depressing look of a plain black or grey background.\n\nA: I've run into that too and ended up using an app called NerdTool to create semi-permanent bars behind my logos (also helped with the icons that I had changed that were partially transparent and completely disappeared against dark backgrounds.\n\nIn this case, I took a frame (ie I googled 3D frame and downloaded an image that looked like it might look ok).  I used NerdTool to put the image on the wallpaper and set the size to what I wanted (took some finagling).  That's how I got the white bar on top.  Then I took a screen shot of a part of my screen that was black, imported that into NerdTool, and stretched and positioned it to be under the letters to make those pop out.\nNerdTool can be a little daunting if you don't know the command line, but for this circumstance you don't actually touch terminal.\nOf course this will only work for files that you plan on keeping put on your desktop and isn't a great solution if your shuffling stuff around a lot, but for me, the files in the screen shot I included are ones that I use frequently and are going to stay there.\nI know this isn't a fix all, but it's something.  Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: You can create your own user .css file to modify the default fonts when using Safari on Yosemite\n", "Q: Display won't follow sleep settings, uses disabled screensaver instead I've been on the Yosemite and noticed only as of just this morning that my screen was on with a screen saver running.\nI have screen savers set to never start, and I have Display sleep set to 10 minutes under Energy Saver.  I went away from my computer again today and came back to find the display on again with the screen saver on again.  I realize I could have processes disrupting display sleep, but why would the screen saver come on if it's been told not to?\nIs this some new Yosemite issue?  How might I fix it?\n\nA: I noticed the same effect in full Yosemite installation: screensaver starts when the computer (macbook air) is put down to sleep. If we add to this the battery \"eating\" behaviour I observed as well. I have unchecked every item that can use power, icloud and handsoff included, but the system itself needs a lot more energy than Mavericks. The general picture of power management seems to be worse than ever.\n", "Q: Airdropped .avi between OSX 10.10 and iOS 8 not found I just used Airdrop to transfer a .avi file between OSX 10.10 and iOS 8. After that I can't locate file in iOS. I searched it in Videos and Photos. Where is it?

It said it had deleted an old backup (boo).\nJust now I did a manual backup (from the TM preferences panel) and it backed up 2 MB to the free 350GB disk and all was fine.\nWhat gives?  What can I do to make TM happy?\n\nA: If on top of your Mac's hard drive, you are also backuping an external USB drive, you may want to check this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/message/27031297\n\nA: Try to open Terminal (use spotlight) and type sudo rm -Rf (Directory to disk)/*\n", "Q: How do I make sure that the Yosemite icon for the Time Machine Disk on my desktop shows the updated version and not the Mavericks version? \nAs you can see in the images the icon for the external drive Quetzalcoatl has update to the Yosemite version, however the Time Machine disk hasn't. Is it possible to force the use of the new icon?\n\nA: Edit: There is nothing wrong here.\n\nUnder /Volumes/, there are two type of mounted volumes associated with Time Machine:\nFirst is the hard drive the backup sits on. If you use Time Capsule, the hard drive inside is by default called Data. Because it's access through network, the volume in the picture has a Shared Disk icon. If you use an external drive through USB, the volume would have a USB/External icon.\nInside, there is a file with name like Someone's Macbook Something.sparsebundle. When backing up, Time Machine would mount this file and create /Volumes/Time Machine Backups. This volume is covered with Time Machine icon, and it only appears with TM is running. The name cannot be altered as far as I know\nMy conjecture is that Budda in question is a volume of a hard drive, not the mounted volume of the sparsebundle. Like other files, volumes can have its icon changed through Get Info window, which is probably why a generic disk got a TM icon in the first place.\nCut and paste the new icon from the location below, and you will have this resolved.\n/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\n\n\nA: I see the incorrect icon displayed every so often with Yosemite and El Capitan.  \nThis is always fixed for me by relaunching the Finder - one way of doing that is holding down Alt, then right clicking on the Finder icon in the dock, and then clicking relaunch.  After that the correct icon is shown on the desktop.\n\nA: You could grab the right one from here & paste it in...\nYosemite drive icon pack\n\n\nA: Click the drive > get info > click on the (old) icon > backspace (or delete) > done.\n", "Q: I Installed Server.app on Yosemite to enable caching, but see many server processes in Task Manager (_xcsbuild and _devicemgr and _calendar processes) _xcsbuild and _devicemgr and _calendar processes seem to be the bulk.\nNone of them are using significant rescues but there are dozens.\nHow do I identify the launcctl jobs and turn them off?\n\nA: You can stop the _xcsbuild \"session\" by running sudo xcrun xcscontrol --shutdown. This will also stop it from starting at launch.\nAlthough it's probably a better idea to use xcscontrol, the individual launchctl tasks are:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.xcsd.plist\n\n*com.apple.xcscouch.plist\n\n*com.apple.xcsredis.plist\n\n*com.apple.xcscontrol.plist\nYou can also delete all the remaining data by running sudo xcrun xcscontrol --reset.\nI'm still looking myself for _devicemgr and _calendar, but just this one is enough to let you shut down/reboot without the warning.\n", "Q: Reinstalled Mac OS X on my MacBook Air & now it won't let me install iMovie and iPhoto?

I'm using OSX El Capitan.\nMy issues were solved by installing SmoothMouse.\nI don't even use any features of the App but it did overwrite some settings and now everything is working fine!\nHope that helps anyone.\n\nA: I found a article how to fix that on Apple Support Communities by Linc Davis.\n\nThis procedure is a test, not a solution. Don’t be disappointed when you find that nothing has changed after you complete it.\nStep 1\nThe purpose of this step is to determine whether the problem is localized to your user account.\nEnable guest logins* and log in as Guest. Don't use the Safari-only “Guest User” login created by “Find My Mac.”\nWhile logged in as Guest, you won’t have access to any of your personal files or settings. Applications will behave as if you were running them for the first time. Don’t be alarmed by this; it’s normal. If you need any passwords or other personal data in order to complete the test, memorize, print, or write them down before you begin.\nTest while logged in as Guest. Same problem?\nAfter testing, log out of the guest account and, in your own account, disable it if you wish. Any files you created in the guest account will be deleted automatically when you log out of it.\n*Note: If you’ve activated “Find My Mac” or FileVault, then you can’t enable the Guest account. The “Guest User” login created by “Find My Mac” is not the same. Create a new account in which to test, and delete it, including its home folder, after testing.\nStep 2\nThe purpose of this step is to determine whether the problem is caused by third-party system modifications that load automatically at startup or login, or by a peripheral device.\nDisconnect all wired peripherals except those needed for the test, and remove all aftermarket expansion cards. Boot in safe mode and log in to the account with the problem. Note: If FileVault is enabled, or if a firmware password is set, or if the boot volume is a software RAID, you can’t do this. Ask for further instructions.\nSafe mode is much slower to boot and run than normal, and some things won’t work at all, including Wi-Fi on certain iMacs.  The next normal boot may also be somewhat slow.\nThe login screen appears even if you usually log in automatically. You must know your login password in order to log in. If you’ve forgotten the password, you will need to reset it before you begin.\nTest while in safe mode. Same problem?\nAfter testing, reboot as usual (i.e., not in safe mode) and verify that you still have the problem. Post the results of steps 1 and 2.\n\n\nA: Using SmoothMouse worked for me as well.  It must overwrite some files.  It worked immediately and has continued to work with no problems.  http://smoothmouse.com/\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite desktop icon positioning problems I just updated my MacBook Pro 13 inch mid 2012 model to OS X Yosemite, and the icons on my desktop are behaving strangely. When I try to move a file or folder to a specific place to keep my desktop organized, it doesn't let me put them where I want them to go. \nBelow is a screenshot of my desktop. I tried to move the folder with the red 1 on it into the empty space where the 2 is, but it wouldn't let me, and the folder moved back to where it was. However, if i were to move the folder to the number 3, it would let me do this.\n\n\nA: I pressed command-j, changed the font from 12 to 11, changed \"sort by\" from \"snap to grid\" to \"none\", moved my icons where I wanted them, put \"snap to grid\" back on, then control-click and selected \"clean up\" to move all the icons back into the alignment of the grid. Since doing this, I have not experienced this problem.\n\nA: By no means a scientific answer, but when this happened to me, I eventually got round it by...\nClosing all windows [to save confusion]\nDragging all the icons over to the left side of the screen, Hit Cmd/J & set Sort by to None [from Snap to grid previously]\nRight clicking the desktop then setting to Clean up by Name, then Sort by Size [or anything other then name]  \nThen set to Sort by None, Sort by Snap to Grid, then manually moving the icons back where I wanted them.  \nThis time they stayed where I set them.\nEssentially I think I just shook up all the prefs & made it have another look.\nIf still no joy, then run Disk Utility & check permissions & verify/repair disk & try the shake-up again.\n\nA: Right click the desktop, and hit clean up.

I want to fix the orientation because I want to convert the video from MOV to MP4, and this would also make it upside down (because it loses the orientation/rotation metadata that the MOV file contains, to properly orient the video).\nHow can I properly rotate the video so that it looks correct?\nI tried a few methods already, but none worked. For instance, I tried this (Can HandBrake flip/rotate a video?), but that didn't work for me. I also tried this (\nvideo captured from iphone gets rotated when converted to .mp4 using ffmpeg\n) but I got a few errors in Terminal when running the commands, like regarding experimental features, etc.\n\nA: I opened iMovie, and imported the upside down video (which only appears upside down in non-Apple apps, like VLC). Since iMovie is an Apple app, it is able to read the rotation metadata, so it showed the video correctly. I then simply exported the video as an MP4 from iMovie, which resulted in a video with the correct orientation.\nNo manual rotation was necessary in iMovie since it already was able to read that metadata, as I mentioned.\n\nA: iMovie & VLC can both do it\nI'm not sure VLC can export the result, but iMovie can.\nThere's also RotateMyVideo which will do it online\niMovie from Crop...\n\nVLC from Effects & Filters > Video Effects > Geometry > Transform\n\nSource : http://www.wikihow.com/Rotate-a-Video\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch Spotlight in OS X to using Google?

We diagnosed this as the issue because every time I rebooted, iCloud/FaceTime/Messages would ask for my password again, even though it had supposedly saved it.\nThis also came right after I had just reset the default Keychain to solve not being able to connect to my wireless network.\n\nA: You'll just have to wait till iOS 8.1 \n", "Q: iPhone cropped photos upload to Facebook uncropped Steps to reproduce problem:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Crop a photo in the Photos app. \n\n*Open the FaceBook app and post the picture. \nOnce it has loaded you see the original un-cropped image. \n\nA: This is a known behavior with the iOS photos app. When you try to share the image, It always uses the original version of the picture which means without the crop or the iOS camera filters. \nSolutions to cropping the photo on iOS\n\n\n*\n\n*Crop the picture using a third-party app and export the image to the photos app\n\n*Crop the picture and take a screenshot of the photo and upload the screenshot.\n\n", "Q: How Do I Know If A File Has Been Successfully Synced To iCloud Drive? I am trying out iCloud Drive as a potential replacement for Dropbox. One of the nice things about Dropbox is that it produces little green checkmarks on file and folder icons to let the user know that a file or folder has been synced with the Dropbox server:\n\nWhen I copied several gigabytes of files to my new iCloud Drive folder, there was no indication that files were syncing nor was there any indication of what was and wasn't synced. I did manage to login to my account on iCloud.com where I saw files being added. This solution however is no where near as convenient as seeing the status in Finder. It also does not let me know if an updated existing file has been updated on the server.\nMy question therefore is, how can I tell if a file has been synced using Finder or any other tool on my computer?\n\nA: OS X 10.10.2 now has graphical upload progress bars:\n\nWhen things get stuck, or you have a slower upload, there is a brctl tool that ships with Yosemite to monitor changes in all iCloud backed documents. Open terminal and type the following command:\nbrctl log --wait --shorten\n\nOn macOS Catalina 10.15 use the following command:\nbrctl log -w --shorten\n\nIt will show you a brief summary of the sync changes both up and down. The wait causes it to run continuously until you close the window or issue Control+C to quit brctl process. If you are familiar with the grep command line tool, you could filter the results to just show upload progress, but most iCloud accounts are quite low volume in terms of changes, so your upload of many files will likely dominate the results.\nhttps://www.icloud.com/#iclouddrive\nAlso, the empirical way to tell if a file is synced is to log in to iCloud drive on the web interface and verify a file and/or folder is up there in the clouds.\n\nA: I have noticed the same problem. The only way I have found is to look at the upload status bar in finder, way down at individual file list level. It shows how far the file has uploaded and then changes to file size when completed.  Definitely not as helpful as Dropbox.\n\nA: This was such a problem for me I actually made a utility called \"iCloudStatus\" which basically behaves the way Dropbox does by showing a status icon in the menu bar (see below).\nThe other alternative is looking at the Finder but if you're uploading large batches of documents nested deeply in folders like I am then it will be a time consuming experience knowing when your files are uploaded.\n\nYou can download it here and for full disclosure I am the developer.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite spotlight search wikipedia and web content missing One of the new features in spotlight was supposed to be information from wikipedia, web when anything was searched.

Yesterday I wanted to do a clean install of Yosemite. I formatted my USB as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and made the partition to be a GUID table partition. \nThen I run this command to copy the bootable installation files of Yosemite to the USB: \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction\n\nEverything went fine and to be sure I verified with Finder that the installation really was in the USB and not corrupted. \nThen I rebooted my MacBook Pro, held the Options Button to get into the boot menu but there my USB wasn´t listed, only the harddrive and the recovery partition. I also tried the other USB port but id did not help. I have googled a lot of this issue but I haven´t found anything that helped. I have also tried the whole procedure of formatting the USB and putting the installation files 3 or 4 times now. \nAfter some hours of tries to boot the USB I gave up.\nWhat I did instead was to open Disk Utilties (from my recovery partition) and format the harddrive, then install Mountain Lion and then make the upgrade to Yosemite. But that is not a clean install. \nAny ideas why I could not boot from the USB?\n\nA: I had the same problem. You have to drag the file from finder into terminal to get the official name of the installer.

Hopefully this works for everyone else.\n\nA: I had this same problem.  I spent a lot of time reading other solutions and playing around.  I even considered wiping my phone's content and starting over.\nIn my case I believe it was because I had purchased an iTunes pre-release album, downloaded those tracks, and then when the album was finally released I ended up having duplicate (purchased) tracks.  \nAlthough I suspect there are other ways to end up with the same issue, anyone reading this I would consider two things.  First, look for duplicate tracks specifically from iCloud, and remove the dupes.  Here are instructions from Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201323\nThat wasn't all though, I then had to nuke the music on my phone and re-sync everything.  This was rather involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect phone to iTunes\n\n*Select Music under Settings\n\n*Turn off Sync Music\n\n*Click Sync\n\n*Observe that there was still a lot of space being used by (now unsynced) music\n\n*Disconnect phone and manually deleting what was left on the phone:  Settings -> General -> Storage & iCloud Usage -> Manage Storage -> Music -> Edit / All Songs -> Delete\n\n*Reconnect phone to iTunes\n\n*Go back to Music under Settings\n\n*Choose \"Sync Music\" (selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres), and re-select the music I wanted synced\n\n*Click Sync then Done\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I had this problem several time.   Just now i found a \"fix\"\nNext to the \"eject\" icon on your iphone-tab in tunes i found a warning exclamation mark.  clicking on it sums up all the erros that happened while copying.

Since upgrading to Yosemite (from Mavericks) my MacBook Pro (Retina mid 2014) is visible (in \"advertising mode\") on Bluetooth (at least to my iPhone). It was not visible prior to Yosemite, and there's nothing that I did on my iPhone (that I can recall) to make this happen.\nWhy is my Mac visible on Bluetooth, and how do I hide it again?\n\nA: Bluetooth needs to be in advertising mode for Yosemite's Handoff to work.\nTo disable Handoff in Mac Yosemite: Select System Prefs > General  and uncheck \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\".\n\n\nA: Looks like the three ways Macs become discoverable (showing up in other computers) via Bluetooth are Bluetooth Sharing, Handoff, and when the Bluetooth Preference pane is open.\nTo keep your Mac from being discoverable via Bluetooth, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Apple menu->System Preferences...\n\n*Select Sharing.\n\n*Turn off Bluetooth Sharing, if it's on.\n\n*Select View menu->General.\n\n*Turn off Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices, if it's on. (This option won't appear on older Macs.)\n\n*Keep Bluetooth Preferences closed except when pairing with another device.\n\n\nYou can check discoverability from another Mac as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Apple menu->System Preferences...\n\n*Select Bluetooth.\n\n*Wait a while to see if your computer appears.\n\n\nA: I've got the same problem - the issue seems to be with Yosemite's insistence to make your MacBooks' bluetooth discoverable in case you want to use the Handoff feature - but the problem is, there are plenty of MacBooks out there which are fast enough to run Yosemite, but too old to support Handoff. In which case, the \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\" tick box is missing and the only way to stop your Mac from advertising its presence via bluetooth seems to be to turn off bluetooth completely. Very annoying!\n\n\nA: Use \"Pref Setter\" to change the Settings in the Bluetooth System preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start \"Pref Setter\"\n\n*Search for \"Bluetooth\"\n\n*In \"System Preferences\" -> com.apple.Bluetooth -> doubleclick -> find \"DiscoverableState\" -> change to \"false\".\n\n*Close window with cmd-w, safe, exit. \n\n*Restart (disable/enable) bluetooth.\n\n\nDon't be alarmed when opening the bluetooth menu. To confirm that this has worked, check Bluetooth state with alt-click on the Bluetooth menu; it should read discoverable: no.\n\nA: Spent hours searching on a solution for this problem but Jawa's answer was the correct way to solve it.

I'm using a Macbook Pro mid 2010. I have an deleted app always showing in my update list and it's very annoying. Problem has occurred since Mountain Lion, but has since become quite eye-catching after I upgraded to Yosemite, where there's always a 'available updates' badge in the menu. \nIt's AngryBirds that I want to remove from the app update list. Users can't hide 3rd party updates. So I tried to get rid of it by trashing it from Applications folder (2 years ago maybe). I hope it would disappear in the update list after I trash it. But it still appears in the App Store update list.\nI also tried to click the update button of the app, and the window told me 'update unavailable with this Apple Id'. I vaguely remembered that this is an app downloaded long time ago. By then I used a different Apple ID. When I deleted this app I have already changed into a new ID. Is this the possible reason for this app remains in the update list even if i've deleted from my mac?\nUpdate: After trying the suggestions provided by all the answers below, I think there's nothing left in my mac with regard to 'AngryBirds' or 'Rovio'.

If I do upgrade, is there anyway that I can revert back to mavericks? I've seen a bunch of things online, but that was only for the developer previews, which rely on the Mavericks installer still being on the app store, which I don't think it is.\nThanks.\n\nA: Clone the drive to a completely separate device.\nSetup Yosemite on one copy, keep the other to swap back if you don't like it.\nYosemite has been seen to change the drive structure from 'regular' GUID to Core Storage, giving people serious headaches trying to get back to the old setup.\nPersonally, I wouldn't touch Yosemite yet without this kind of fallback solution. \nI know effectively in SE I'm in the doctor's waiting room complaining it's full of sick people - but there have been too many 'oopsies' in the past week for me to suggest anything less safe.\n\nA: Your solutions are:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create a new partition, and install Yosemite on it. You can try it there, and if you like it, delete the Mavericks partition and increase\n  the Yosemite one\n  \n*Make a Time Machine Backup.

I have only two permissions across my entire Home folder tree, me read-write and everyone read-only. I seem to be the owner for every file.\nCan someone out there poke about in their Library and similar folders and see if this is the same? I suspect that either a group needs write permission, or that some of the files are not supposed to be owned by me.\n\nA: Ok, just in case this comes up again, maybe I'll find my own answer :-)\nThe problem is that modern versions of OS X apply new permissions seemingly at random when problems are encountered. In this case, the OS added a third permission to everything below the home folder, and the permission was \"everyone (custom)\". Opening it, I found it disallowed writes by me to my own folder.\nSuggestions for others; pick a file at random, maybe in your documents, and Get Info. Look at permissions - the first line should be \"me\", and is likely broken otherwise. Also check the enclosing folder for same.\n\nA: Linking this answer for future searchers.

Users can access file shares from Mac and Windows computers and from iOS devices, with no special software\n\nThey specifically say that it should be possible to access file shares from iOS devices without third party software like e.g. Transmit. I can however not for my life find anything, anywhere about how this is actually supposed to work or how one would configure it.\nSpontaneously it sounds like it would be handled by the new storage provider API in iOS 8, but as far as I can see, only iCloud drive is included in the system.\nDoes anyone know anything about this?\n\nA: Looking at https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=16976 the key is to configure a 'mac os x server' account, and then enable iCloud Files. That way you can access files on the server just like iCloud files.\nOnly downside I've found so far, you need to enable iCloud files too, you can't just use file sharing of OS X Server.\n\nA: OS X Server allows you to set up file share points using the WebDAV protocol. This in turn allows iOS apps that support WebDAV access the files on the share point. Since iOS doesn't allow the user to browse the device file system, there is no way to upload or download arbitrary files just on the device.\nHowever, within an app that supports WebDAV, you can download and upload files. Three examples are the iWork apps for iOS, which include Pages, Keynote and Numbers. WebDAV Navigator is another example.\n", "Q: Connect firewire MacMini to thunderbolt MacBook Pro I have a MacMini that only has a firewire port, I want to connect it to my MacBook Pro via its thunderbolt port, can I do this so that I can then (using target mode) display my Mac mini on my macbook pro)?

(See About OS X Recovery.)\n\nNewer Macs include the ability to start up directly from an Internet-based version OS X Recovery. Your Mac automatically uses this feature when the Recovery System on the startup drive isn't available. For example, if your startup drive encounters an issue, or if your startup drive has been replaced or erased. Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's servers. Starting up from this system performs a quick test of your memory and hard drive to check for hardware issues.\nInternet Recovery initially asks you to select a Wi-Fi network and enter a network password when needed. Next, Internet Recovery downloads and starts from a Recovery System image. From there, you are offered the same utilities and options as the Recovery System on a startup drive.\n\n2011 MacBook Pro may need a firmware update in order to do this.

After an initial start, it kept going to blank gray screen in the middle of bootup.  I have several accounts on this machine.  I finally restarted in safe mode and after logging on to my administrative account the Mac informed me I had a piece of incompatible software -- \"Instant On\".  This was automatically moved to the \"Incompatible Software\" folder and the installation finished.  I have done a shutdown and restart and all appears fine.\n\nA: What happens if you shut it down & restart just holding onto the option key? That should give you the “Startup Manager” screen which will let you choose a startup disk; more details from Apple’s site. Also if you have a USB drive—thumb drive or other kind of drive—you might be able to boot from that to get some kind of disk repair to happen.\nWhen you boot up from another disk, I would recommend Disk Utility repair the disk. If that does not work—and you are sure there is nothing on the disk you need—then perhaps you can erase the disk. But that is a bit of a radical solution.\nI would recommend launching Terminal form the USB disk and then looking at your disk usage. Maybe the disk is full or near full? If so, that might be the problem. I would then recommend you go find something you know is taking up space and simply delete from the command line.\nThe first command I would recommend you run is ls -lah on the /Applications directory like this:\nls -lah /Applications/\n\nLook for any large sized files you can toss. The most obvious one in my mind would be the Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite installer.  It should be named Install OS X Yosemite.app. To get rid of that just run this command:\nrm /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nThe backslashes are to escape the spaces. You can also run it like this with quotes around the filepath:\nrm \"/Applications/Install OS X Yosemite.app\"\n\nAfter doing that, try to reboot from your MacBook Air’s hard drive. It should work.\nWhen you are back in the system, I would see about clearing out more space.  First, manually look around for stuff you are 100% positive you can toss or copy elsewhere like stuff in your personal ~/Documents/ directory.  Then I would recommend you download Onyx. There are different versions for different OS versions and while it doesn’t seem like a Yosemite version has been released yet, I would expect that to appear in a few days. Run that to clear out deeper system data & caches that might be taking up space.\nUPDATE: According to the comments from the original poster, the system disk for the MacBook Air won’t even mount. If that is the case, then I recommend resetting the PRAM or NVRAM depending on the make/model of your MacBook Pro.\nInstructions for dealing with the PRAM are here on Apple’s site; ignore the title that refers to Mavericks since those instructions should work with all version of Mac OS X:\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac.\n\n*Start your Mac.\n\n*Immediately hold down the command + option + p + r keys.\n\n*You will hear the Mac OS star up chime once, and then once more as it restarts form the PRAM being reset. After the second “BONG” sound let go of the keys & boot up as normal.\n\nInstructions on how to reset the NVRAM are here. It seems a tad more daunting but not really that hard to do:\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac.\n\n*Start your Mac.\n\n*During starup hold down the command + option + o + f keys.\n\n*When you get into open firmware—which should look like a terminal prompt—type in the following two commands:\n\n\nreset-nvram return\nreset-all return\n\nYour MacBook Air will now restart with cleared NVRAM settings.\n", "Q: Can I use BootCamp on an existing Windows partition?

I just upgraded to Yosemite and my current best interpretation of what's happening is that there's a new behavior that \"helpfully\" moves the mouse (and a window if you're moving one) closer to an edge of the screen when moving quickly enough.\nI really dislike this, in great part because it causes very strange behavior when I'm playing a game. \nIs this a setting that can be changed?\nWith additional testing, it looks like the mouse doesn't snap to the edge, but has tremendous acceleration in some cases (quick changes in direction?) which it didn't have before the upgrade to Yosemite.\n\nA: It turns out Yosemite enables mouse acceleration by default. it can be disabled by typing this in terminal:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\n\nAfter changing this setting in Terminal, you'll need to logout and log back in to your Mac.  Relaunching Finder will work too (option + right-click on Finder icon in dock -> Relaunch)\n\nA: USB Overdrive remains the best way to control mouse speed/acceleration in OS X, in my opinion. Apple's mouse driver is appallingly bad.\n\nA: Even with mouse acceleration turned off, OS X uses an 'acceleration curve', which makes the mouse slower and the movements less linear.\nTo disable the acceleration curve/set it to a linear one, download Steelseries Exact Mouse Tool, open it and set it to 'always on'(there will be an icon in your menu bar).\nIt doesn't just work with Steelseries mice, I use it with my razer mamba in combination with their drivers and it works perfectly.\n\nA: Using defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 doesn't let you set your mouse speed.\nI tried USB overdrive and it does the job even if I'm sure there are other applications that handle this.\n\nA: I highly recommend the program called smooth mouse. It works perfectly for me.\nIt enables you to choose different settings for the mouse and trackpad (acceleration on trackpad is highly desirable, in contrast with the mouse).\nIt can be downoaded for free here: http://smoothmouse.com/\n\nA: If you have a razer product and use razer synapse the following apply:\nThe acceleration can be reenabled on OS X update. To disable again just drag acceleration up and then down to 0 again and the issue is fixed.\n\nA: I can't comment yet but I also want to chime in for USB overdrive, which works with El Capitan.\nBut just having the USB overdrive driver does not remove mouse acceleration even after unchecking the Acceleration box within the driver settings.

In this case Command Line Tools is listed several times in a row. How do I remove these multiple entries from the app store.\n\nA: The log of your updates are available in:\n~/Library/Application Support/App Store/updatejournal.plist\n\nThe simple solution is to clear the update logs by deleting the mentioned file. \nHere is the guide to remove duplicate if you want to keep the update logs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Convert the updatejournal.plist by entering this line plutil -convert xml1 then drag the updatejournal.plist from Finder into Terminal to expand the path, then press Return. Mine is the following:\nplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/App\\ Store/updatejournal.plist \n\n\n*Open ~/Library/Application\\ Support/App\\ Store/updatejournal.plist with your favorite text editor (TextEdit works fine).\n\n*Find the duplicate update logs. For example, mine is Command Line Tools (OS X 10.10). The point is to delete that entry which is inside the scope of <dict>. So you should delete the content between <dict> and </dict>. Here is line I need to delete. Save the file.\n<dict>\n    <key>__isSoftwareUpdate</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>installDate</key>\n    <date>2014-10-17T09:55:17Z</date>\n    <key>productKey</key>\n    <string>031-08844</string>\n    <key>release-notes</key>\n    <string>Command Line Developer Tools for OS X 10.10</string>\n    <key>title</key>\n    <string>Command Line Tools (OS X 10.10)</string>\n    <key>version</key>\n    <string>6.1</string>\n</dict>\n\n\n*Convert the file back to binary1 by entering this line plutil -convert binary1 and drag the updatejournal.plist from Finder, and press Return. Here is mine in Terminal:\nplutil -convert binary1 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/App\\ Store/updatejournal.plist \n\n\n*Open Mac App Store and refresh the Updates section. The duplicate line should disappear. Remember to only delete one entry of duplicate file. Imagine that plist as a spreadsheet with duplicate lines.

I hope your problem will be fixed also.\nThis is the essential point: He said it was due to a Spotlight behavior when Spotlight is disabled.\nTo resolve this, we need to re-enable Spotlight:\n$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n$ sudo mdutil -E /\n\nAfter rebooted you can disable it again if you desire using:\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\n\nA: Just reboot your mac before updating.\n", "Q: Symbolic link icons don't update When a symlink is created, it gets the icon of the target folder (with the addition of a black arrow in the lower left corner). The issue I am having is that the symlink icon does not update when the icon of the target folder changes. Deleting and recreating the symlink does not fetch a new icon from the target folder: the symlink continues to show the old icon.\nWhat's strage though is that if I right click and \"Get Info..\" on the symlink, it shows the correct icons in the information pane... but in the finder window itself, the icon is out of date. This leads me to believe there is some cache for the actual icon that is displayed in the finder window, and it needs to be refreshed.\nThe issue can be recreated fairly easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on Desktop called \"Target Folder\"\n\n*Right click Target Folder, Get Info.. and paste any icon from another folder.\n\n*Create a symlink on the Desktop called \"Symbolic Folder\" that links to Target Folder. (Symbolic Folder will now have the same icon as Target Folder).\n\n*Right click Target Folder, Get Info.. and paste a new, different icon. (Symbolic Folder does not update and will continue to show the old icon)\n\n*Right click Symbolic Folder, Get Info.. the information pane shows the correct icon.\n\n\nAny idea how to get Symbolic Folder to show the new icon in the Finder window?\nThis issue has come up due to Yosemite's change of the folder icon style. I use symlinks to link my main user folders (Pictures, Movies, Music, etc) to folders in Dropbox, and many of my symlink icons continue to show the old, pre-Yosemite folder icons even though I have updated the icons of the folders they link to. I'd like to be able to clear out all of the old folder icons.\nThis post seems relevant, but the solution did not work for me:\nwrong icon of Unix symbolic link in Finder\nUPDATE\nThe \"caching\" of the incorrect symlink icon happens only in the \"view mode\" where the icon of the target folder is changed. So if you follow the steps above in a Finder window where the view mode is set to \"icon\" then the issue will persist only in Finder windows where the view mode is set to \"icon\". If you are browsing in a Finder window where the view mode is set to \"cover flow\" or \"list\" then the symlink functions correctly and the icon tracks the icon of the target folder just fine (until, that is, you change this icon of the target folder in either the cover flow or list view modes). This explains why the information pane for the symlink shows the correct icon.\n\nA: I had this problem and the following seems to have resolved it. I'm not sure if steps 2 and 3 are both required so you can try one and then the other if you prefer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove symbolic links\n\n*Clear your icon cache:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\n\n*Clear your caches:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*\nsudo rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*\n\n*Restart\n\n*Recreate symbolic links\n\n\nA: As noted above, the issue is the icon cache. Clearing all of your caches will work, but I'm not a fan of blunderbus approaches. \nDeleting ONLY the icon cache, if you'd prefer a more targeted fix, will work just as well.\nThe icon cache lives here:\n/Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nDeleting just this folder and restarting will change the icons back to what they should be.\n\nA: If you change the icon in the alias's info window, and it doesn't update when you close the info window, simply make an alias of that alias, and the new icon will appear as expected.  Now delete the alias with the bad icon, as the alias you made from it, is actually an alias of the original folder.\n\nA: If you don't mind changing the date on the symlink ... touch -h symlinkfilename.\n", "Q: iTerm2 settings are reset upon app close If I change a setting within iTerm2, using the Preferences panel ex. under Window i set transparency and blur.

I have two monitors. If I'm focused on the left monitor, I cannot use a shortcut to switch spaces on the right monitor. Or (as often happens) I click my right monitor to focus it instead of alt tabbing, and then I cannot switch the left monitor space with my keyboard without clicking on that screen.\nIs there not a way to control the space of another monitor with your keyboard?\n\nA: Ctrl-Left Arrow/Right Arrow let you scroll through spaces from the keyboard in Mavericks.\nSpaces are only independent if you have \"Displays Have Separate Spaces\" enabled under System Preferences > Mission Control -- with this option enabled, you should be able to switch workspaces on each monitor independently. The monitor that switches when you use the keyboard shortcut should be the monitor where the pointer currently resides.\n\nA: The keyboard shortcuts for switching spaces apply to the display that the pointer is on - there isn't really a way of getting round that, as far as I'm aware. \n\nA: Yes, if you know applescript.\nFor example, to switch to Space 1 on the Secondary Display. Note: \n1) Primary/Secondary Display is defined by where the Menu Bar is (i.e. System Preference -> Display -> Arrangement), not by cursor focus.\n2) This script switches to Space 1, whether it's a Desktop or fullscreen app. If you want to switch only to Desktop 1, it can be done, but not with this script as it is.\n3) If you don't mind flashing, remove delay 0.5 line.\n4) The script cannot do without the animation/transition.\n5) Enable Accessibility and all the standard applescript spiel. \n6) Modify button number to switch to a different Space on that Display. Modify list number to switch a different Display.\n7) Switching to a non-existent Space, e.g. Space 100, would leave the UI at mission control. Nothing bad is going in bad to your computer. It just stays there, and user will have to manually drop back to current Space.\n8) No relative switching, i.e. move left or right a space. Just absolute switching.\n9) Cursor focus doesn't switch display after running this script. That's a plus.\n10) No simultaneously switching Spaces on both displays.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    do shell script \"/Applications/Mission\\\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\\\ Control\"\n    delay 0.5\n    tell process \"Dock\" to tell group 1 to tell list 2 to tell button 1 to click\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: The free app \"CurrentKey Stats\" will do just what you want: https://currentkey.com/\nWith CKS, you can assign a hotkey to each Desktop/Workspace. Pressing that hotkey will bring up the assigned space no matter which monitor has the mouse or has the active focus. You can be working in the main monitor and press your chosen hotkey to change which desktop is visible in the side monitor, without losing focus in the main monitor or having to move the mouse.\nCKS has the powerful feature of being able to assign names to each desktop workspace -- and (here's the cool part) the names persist if you change the order of your desktop spaces, even if you move them to another monitor. That seriously beats the Mission Control names of Desktop 1, Desktop 2, etc., especially if you like to rearrange the order to put things you're working on at the same time into adjacent workspaces.\nI currently have 21 desktop spaces and I was running out of mnemonic hotkeys that I could type one-handed and didn't have side effects in one app or another, so I created a menu in \"Keyboard Maestro\". Other apps like QuickKeys or Alfred can probably do the same kind of thing.\nIn my KBM menu, I type a hotkey, Shift+Option+Command+S, that I can do with my left hand and it brings up a menu listing the names of all the desktop workspaces. A second keystroke, this time without any modifiers, picks from the menu. (Actually, the menu items can say whatever I want, I use the CKS name preceded by the menu choice mnemonic letter.)\nMy primary reason for making sure that I can access my Spaces menu (Shift+Option+Command+S) and the menu choices one-handed is that if you change desktop workspace while in the middle of dragging a window, you drag that window to the new workspace.\n", "Q: Unable to boot into ElementaryOS on MacBook after PRAM reset I installed ElementaryOS on a separate partition of my HDD.\nNot sure what happened but the audio in OSX stopped working after the installation.

As it says that I can skip this step and configure it later, I did.\nNow, I am trying to set up iCloud and upgrade to iCloud Drive.\nWhen I click on the iCloud icon in System Preferences, the App freezes (beach balling) and I am forced to force quit it.\nIn the Force Quit window, I see System Preferences (not responding) and right below it I see com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice (not responding). If I Force Quit System Preferences, naturally, the whole app quits. If I force quit com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice then I get a notice in the System Preferences app that says Preferences Error: Could not load iCloud preference pane.\nIn Activity Monitor, I can also see that both System Preferences and com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice are not responding.\nIn console, I see the following crash report:\n20/10/2014 01:46:04.026 System Preferences[4901]: ### com.apple.preferences.icloud instantiatePrefPaneObject exception:service com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice failed to init an instance of iCloudRemoteViewService on behalf of <NSRemoteView: 0x7fb885309930> due to proxy-communications-error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 \"Couldn’t communicate with a helper application.\" (The connection from pid 0 was invalidated from this process.)

The main one (funnily enough) seems to be called /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist. That's the one that stores your account details (ID, UUID, DSID and AlternateDSID) and information about the services you have enabled or disabled.\nYou could try closing System Preferences entirely, renaming that file temporarily, restarting your Mac and then seeing if System Preferences can then open its iCloud pane.\n\nA: In case you don't read through the comments on Alistair's excellent advice above, once you've renamed/moved/deleted /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/MobileMeAccounts.plist restart. When Yosemite comes back up again, it will ask you for your iCloud password and it should all work.\nThis does seem to happen if you decline to set up iCloud during the initial install.\n", "Q: Alfred 2 fails to launch after upgrade to Yosemite I just upgraded to Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and Alfred 2 fails to launch.\nIn Activity Monitor, it reports that it is not responding, and the only thing I can do is Force Quit it.\nConsole doesn't report any messages except the kill message from my force quit.\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: Don't use Alfred myself so I can't give a specific answer.\nSomething I would try though is using opensnoop to see if I can work out where it is failing.\nIf you type sudo opensnoop | grep alfred into a Terminal it'll show you all the files that Alfred is touching.

What is meant by backing up computer vs. creating a copy of entire hard-drive?  Are the meanings the same?\nHow to create entire bootable copy of my computer using time machine?\nI have a time capsule.  Is what I have an exact copy of my computer?\n\nA: Time Machine (TM) will allow you to restore your computer to the way it was by copying the the TM files onto the disc in your computer.  When you do a TM restore, you will be back to the same state you were in at the time of the last backup.  There are a few caveats to this.  It assumes that your computer's hardware is fully functional--you have a good display, a good hard drive to copy to, etc.  It also assumes that, for a reasonably large TM backup, you have the time to spare to do the restore.  This can be easily half a day until you are back up and running.\nWhen you create a bootable backup, you may also be able to restore from this backup, but the key advange is that it is immediately bootable.  No need to wait many hours for a restore, you can quickly get working again.  Additionally, you can use any hardware.  Lets assume that your computer is totally fried; just take your bootable backup to another machine, boot from it, and it appears to be your original machine.  Email is configured, documents are available, applications can be run.\nMy personal backup strategy is to use both TM backup and bootable backup.  If I have the time to restore from TM, I will do that.  I make my living from my Mac, so I have the bootable backup for emergencies.  I can be up and running quickly if I am under a tight deadline.  Hard drives are inexpensive, so my recommendation is to do both!\n", "Q: When woken up from sleep, some Chrome windows are blurry I have a 2nd monitor attached to my Retina MBP. I was on OS X Mavericks and had this problem, where sometimes the displays would go to sleep and when I wake them, many tabs within Chrome look blurry on my main Retina screen.\nWhen I move the tabs over to the non-retina monitor, it actually fixed it. i.e. the solution is to temporarily move the tab to the non-retina monitor (drop it there) and then bring it back and all of a sudden it looks crispy clear again.\nObviously this is a non-scalable/sustainable strategy.\nI assumed that by upgrading to Yosemite that would take care of that, but it didn't.

I was using Glims under Mavericks but that no longer works.  I tend to have lots of tabs open and sometimes it's easier to find the proper tab by the favicon rather than the text.\n\nA: As of Safari 8, favicons no longer show up on the tab bar, to my disappointment.\nOne solution is to use SafariStand & EasySIMBL. Once installed (see instructions on the SafariStand site), open the SafariStand settings and check \"Show Icon on Tab Bar\". This will return favicons to the tabs.\n\nA: You can't. But a workaround is to use this Safari Extension to add emoji to the tabs instead of favicons. For a lot of popular sites there is an emoji that closely matches the favicon or brand!\n\nA: Instead of favicons, try zooming out with a trackpad or a mousepad.

Some cloning apps won't work over a network at all, and some that do don't recommend it.  Some suggest cloning to a disk image, but since you can't boot from a disk image, you'd have to restore it somewhere first.

Is there a way to delete it on the device, or do I need to do it through iTunes?\n\nA: Go to Settings → General → Usage and delete the iOS 8 update package from the list.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite & Time Machine: identity of the backup disk has changed From time to time (I did not yet figure out a systematic way to reproduce the error) I get an error message when a new Time Machine backup begins: it says that the identity of my Time Machine backup disk has changed (see also this article from the Apple website). I recently made a clean OS X Yosemite install. I also noticed that my Computer name changes automatically from the name I gave it in the first place, MyName, to MyName (2).

There are other reports of this happening in a thread on MacRumors Forum and I believe a few people have blamed this as a cause of time machine backup failures. I've tried a few of the suggestions in the thread but so far none have worked. I've stopped using time machine for now and reverted to an old bash rsync script.\nA really simple solution is to open the terminal and type:\nrsync -avu ~/ /Volumes/backup_disk/backup_folder\n\nreplacing 'backup_disk' with the name of your external hard drive and 'backup_folder' with the name of the backup folder i.e.: 'yosemite_backup'. The three flags -avu mean: archive (a) copy the home directory recursively into sub folders, verbose (v) print to the terminal window everything you are copying (feel free to leave this out) and update (u) will only overwrite files that are newer than the archived file (useful after the initial main backup). This solution isn't as hands off as time machine but at least it's a simple way to back up vital information in Documents and Pictures/Videos.\nEdit: 2014/10/28 - I've had success with the following procedure:\nGo to Macintosh HD > Library > Preferences > SystemConfiguration and delete the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n*NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*preferences.plist\n\n\nThen remove the numeric iteration (#) from the computer name (or rename altogether) in System Preferences > Sharing and reboot. The plist files will be recreated after reboot. So far this has fixed the computer name issue with Yosemite on my machine and time machine seems to be back on track.\nNote: This fix seems to be inconsistent with users and may not fix the naming issue after all.\nEdit 2: 2014/11/11 - The above seems to have worked for about 2 weeks but the renaming issue is now back.\n\nA: That Time Machine backup no longer belongs to that computer. You did a clean install & broke the relationship between the two.\nTime Machine will continue to back up new data to any available space, but it considers the old data doesn't belong to it. You can still use it to manually copy data to the 'new' machine, but \"Enter Time Machine\" will only go back as far as the clean install.\n", "Q: Dropbox public link video - downloading onto an iPad I'm trying to get this 70mb video, which I have uploaded to a public Dropbox folder onto this lady's iPad. She doesn't have a computer and I don't want her to have to do too much work to get this video into the camera. How exactly do i do this? The extremely useful Safari doesn't allow saving videos to the camera roll.\nI should also add she wants to save the video to the camera roll, not anywhere else.\n\nA: I'd recommend using the app called Documents (https://readdle.com/products/documents).

This blinking takes place all the time. Sometimes it is colored, sometimes just bright or dark. It is really distracting when there's a blinking effect in the corner of your eye.\nAny idea what triggers this strange behaviour? Or might this just be an annoying bug in Yosemite and I have to wait for an update from Apple?\n(In the meantime I downgraded back to Mavericks using a TimeMachine backup, which - much to my surprise - was no hassle at all! I think I'll refrain from installing Yosemite again, until an update will be offered by Apple.)\n\nA: After checking the option \"Reduce tranparency\" in \"System Preferences\" -> \"Accessibility\" -> \"Display\", the blinking finally ended. Now the menubar also looks more like in Mavericks, no blurred tranparency effects anymore: neither in the title bar of my windows nor in the menubar.\n", "Q: Is it true that an expedited review in the app store is not allowed for more than one application?

I would to know that if i have already requested for expedited review of my previous application before one month, is it possible to request again for expedited review in the app store for my current application? I have heard to peoples that we can only request for expedited review once in a year.\n\nA: I don't think there's an automated system, I once requested two expedited reviews in a row (due to my own improper testing), and got both accepted.\nSo no, no firm rule, but they'll probably look at your history when deciding, and your reason for asking for an expedited review.\n\nA: there are no limits to how many app reviews you can ask to be expedited.\n\nA: You can expedite your reviews number of times , but remember that you should have strong reason for it like time sensitive event of app or critical bug fixing\n", "Q: How to transfer photos not in Camera Roll from iPhone to PC?

When we triple-click and triple-click is set to Guided Access, nothing happens. When I add something like voice-over to the triple-click functionality, I get the menu where I can select Guided Access (or voice-over), but again when tapping Guided Access nothing happens.\nI'm fairly confident this is related to the restrictions we placed on the device group, but for the love of me I can't seem to figure out what restriction is stopping this from working. We don't have Single App Mode turned on due to the fact that the devices move between random wifi-networks and we need to be able to configure them on the device, but I added the apps that we need guided access for in the \"Allow these apps to enter Single App Mode\" list anyway, without that helping.\nWhich restriction is stopping us from entering Guided Access Mode?\n\nA: This is actually a bug in iOS 8 (and 8.1). If you have guided access enabled when updating from iOS 7 it stops working. The fix is to turn it off, reboot the device, then turn it back on again.\n", "Q: How to select text with touchpad without pressing the \"hard\" key? Now on OS X, when I want to select some text, I have to press the \"hard\" key on touchpad with thumb and drag through the text with another finger on touchpad.

For a while, everything seemed fine, but then all got ever so slightly slower and slower, especially when switching desktops.\nAfter losing patience, I opened Activity Monitor and to my shock, I found around a dozen old Safari Web Content processes still running and using a lot of memory, despite the tabs having been closed already.\nAnyone noticed a similar thing? Or knows a way to force Safari to kill the process after closing a tab?\n(Macbook Pro, mid-2012, 13inch, 4GB RAM)\n\nA: \"Web Content Process\" = \"Tab\" is a wrong assumption. A Web Content process can hold more than one tab. Depending on the implementation details of Safari, it might be possible that after closing the last Tab related to a particular Web Content Process, it does not automatically mean to close that Web Content Process. It might be feasible for Safari to keep that Process idle in the background ready to take a new tab when needed. I think Mavericks Safari behaves the same. \nOn your experience of \"slower and slower\": It might be that 4GB of RAM are insufficient for your normal workload. As a result, virtual memory is used. That means your HDD (or SSD) is used as an extension for your RAM, when more memory is needed to drive all open processes. Usage of HDD means a slowdown. An SSD is better in that respect.\nI use Safari 7 on Mavericks, I will not test now what happens when closing a big enough number of tabs. But let me describe the normal situation on my MBP: At the moment, my Safari has 4 windows open, each contains 10 to 40 tabs, in sum ~100 tabs opened. In Activity Monitor, I can see 20 Web Content Processes, each 9 to 12 threads. In addition, I have 13 QTKitserver Web Content Processes, each 2 threads.\nAll web content processes have a 3-digit PID, which means they were started at the beginning after my last reboot, which is 3 days ago. So the Web Content Processes are reused by Safari. If they were new processes, they would have gotten a 4 or 5 digit PID. Though, I admit I did not open and close that many tabs since the last reboot. I have 8GB of RAM and an SSD on a late 2009 MBP.\nYou can read at some places that Yosemite needs a little more RAM than Mavericks. Maybe that's enough to slow down your 4GB system in comparison to Mavericks. Though it should not perform much worse than Mavericks. By the way, a nice read on memory management for 10.9 can be found here.\nBottom line: Consider installing 8GB RAM. It's dirt cheap for a non-Retina MBP. \nAnd you can do it yourself. Just figure out before which RAM-Modules are for your MBP Model:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT201165?viewlocale=en_US#1.\nIt seems that even 16GB are possible for even older MBPs if one is lucky. Beware, this 16GB topic needs more research: https://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1511196\nBut I do not know if that is needed in your case. In my humble opinion, 8GB are fine.\n\nA: I've seen this ever since Safari 8 on OS X 10.9.5, OS X 10.10.x all versions with Safari 8 and sadly in Safari 9 on all El Capitan betas to date, too. The Safari memory leak in my case is severe and Safari has to be completely quit & restarted often. It only seems to happen if you tend to have a few windows open a lot, which you \"reuse\"; but overall, Safari just grows and grows (by many GB).\nSuggestions about \"putting in more memory\" are absurd. I've a 16GB Macbook Pro laptop which is the maximum configuration of soldered-on (\"pro\" my rear-end!) memory which Apple provide. It simply isn't possible to add more. Memory pressure and slowdown tend to get critical when Safari exceeds 10GB. I did once persist to the point where it was using over 13GB. When restarted with all tabs manually revisited to ensure all pages are loaded, it'll go back to about 2.5Gb. A leak of that size is utterly indefensible.\nThis is a stark change in behaviour from Safari 7, which behaved basically fine in this regard - yet there are surprisingly few reports of it online. It isn't a subtle problem and Safari 8 has been around for ages. Others would have noticed, yet few report it.\nI see it on my 10.9.5 machine, 10.10 home laptop, 10.11 test laptop and even, more recently, a 10.10 laptop at work. My conclusion is that this must be Safari screwing up when particular bookmark, cookie, cache and/or other data is present and this data must be part of the stuff it shares over iCloud - otherwise I would not have expected my independently clean-installed-by-IT-vendor work laptop to exhibit exactly the same behaviour.\nBottom line is that this seems to be a user data thing. Taking a deep breath and doing a complete Safari reset - ditching your iCloud bookmarks, emptying everything from every Safari instance on the iCloud account, deleting ~/Library/Safari and so-on - might work according to the Developer Forums. But as ever with Apple since roughly OS X 10.7, its a heisenbuggy mess and no amount of psuedorandom chicken slaying will be guaranteed to fix your issue.\nClosed tab stray processes might just be down to a \"bad extension\", but that's no excuse - extensions are under Safari control, and a bad extension should never be able to break the browser. It's just JavaScript code executing completely under the browser's oversight. Still, we know that Safari must have very poor code for extension support given the problematic history, so that's always worth investigating if you haven't already.\n", "Q: Firewall: Add command-line tool to rules (mosh-server) How can I add a command line tool I've installed manually to the system firewall? The tool is Mobile Shell (mosh) installed via the excellent Homebrew)?\nSpecifically, I want to add a rule for /usr/local/bin/mosh-server that allows incoming UDP traffic on 60001-60999.\nI've tried using System Preference's Firewall pane and the \"+\" button, but I cannot seem to browse to /usr. I've configured Finder to display hidden and system files using TinkerTool, but that seemingly has no affect on the selection dialogue, which still hides /usr.\nI've read a bit about using ipfw, but that's no longer available in Yosemite (v10.10). pfctl seems to be the replacement. I'll use these if I have to, but I'd much rather add an entry to the system firewall UI, so the change is discoverable.\n\nA: I knew I was being dumb: in the Finder dialog that pops up, press Shift+⌘+G and enter /usr. From there I can browse to the binary.\nTurns out this is a completely ordinary Finder shortcut for \"Go to folder\".\n", "Q: Native resolution not available on lg ultrawide with mac mini (2012) I'm aware of displaying more resolutions with the option key like in this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/149152 but after upgrading to 10.10 the resolution of 3840x(i think)1080 of the lg ultrawide is not available anymore. The display is connected via thunderbolt. It changed after the upgrade, before it was no problem. The max resolution available is 2560x1080.\n\nA: It requires a kext swap to an older graphics driver.

Everymac says this display has a DVI port.\nWill I be able to connect the HDMI output from a standard DVD or Blu-ray player to this display, via a suitable cable or adapter, and watch DVDs on it, or is there something I've missed that would prevent this working?\n\nA: AFAIK these display are not HDCP compliant therefore you'll have some troubles watching movies that have these protections. \n", "Q: iOS 8 iPhone Cellular Calls on iPad/Mac with 2 iPhones sharing same iCloud account With the iOS 8 Continuity features you can make and receive phone calls on your iPad or Mac using your iPhone, provided they're all on the same WiFi network and using the same iCloud account.\nHowever, my wife and I both use the same iCloud account and we both have an iPhone. It's the same iCloud account that's configured on the iPad (and on my Mac). In the settings for FaceTime both on iPad and on the Mac, under the heading iPhone Cellular Calls it says These calls will use the caller ID +xxx xxx xxx xxx, and the number is my wife's cell phone number, not mine. \nIn the situation I'm in (2 iPhones using the same iCloud account in the same house), how can I tell FaceTime which iPhone it should use for the continuity calling feature? \nApart from the caller ID issue, I can't make calls from my iPad or Mac using my iPhone (when my wife's phone is out of the house). It says \"iPhone Not Available. Your iPhone and Mac must be on the same Wi-Fi network\". However, if I receive a call on my iPhone it appears fine on both iPad and Mac. \n\nA: Ok, figured it out myself. My first problem was that for some reason my phone hadn't activated properly with iMessage / FaceTime (my phone number was unchecked in the You can be reached by FaceTime At section in FaceTime settings). That required switching off FaceTime and iMessage and switching them back on again after a short wait so that they could activate properly, which they did.\nOnce that was done, my FaceTime settings (on my iPhone) had a new option: iPhone Mobile Calls:\n\nMy wife's phone also has that setting. Choosing which phone is used is just a question of only having this setting enabled on one phone at a time. I assume (all though I haven't tried it) that if both phones are enabled in this way, FaceTime on iPad or Mac gives you the choice of which phone/number to use. It wasn't giving me a choice earlier because there was only one phone enabled.\n", "Q: phpMyAdmin 403 Forbidden Error after upgrade to Yosemite I upgraded my Mac to Mac OS X Yosemite.\nI had a AMP stack installed via Homebrew on Mavericks and it worked fine.\nAfter upgrading to Yosemite, I have the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*when trying to load phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin I get the following error:\n\n\n\nForbidden\nYou don't have permission to access /phpmyadmin on this server.\n\nThe error log shows: [Mon Oct 20 11:34:17.235518 2014] [authz_core:error] [pid 70303] [client ::1:50374] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin\n\n\n*When trying to load localhost, I get a blank page.

So one of the deal breakers that was preventing me from upgrading to OS X 10.10 is how ugly the dock looked (to me). \nSince I had success getting some of the Yosemite's apps up and running on Mavericks (Yosemite's terminal for example, it supports scrolling with trackpad for some cli programs where you normally have to scroll with C-n, C-p or directional keys), naturally I tried the opposite, i.e. running Mavericks' Dock.app on Yosemite. Surprisingly, it worked! At least, partially. Functionality-wise, it works just fine, but on the looks it is missing the background image of the Mavericks' Dock.app.\nCan someone more knowledgeable figure out a way to make this work 100%? As far as I know I'm not the only person wishing for this to work so if you can figure this out, you're doing us, a portion of the Mac community a big favor!\n\nA: There's an app online called cDocks should sort u out\n\ncDock will unleash your Dock!

You can also get the 10.8 dock as well as 10.9. I think this is the best thing to use. Here are some screenshots. Hope it works out!

Even if I go to Cell>Date Format and change it.  The system ignores this and returns to displaying the answer as a number of days.  How do I force the system to show this cell as a number and not in the date / days format?\n\nA: You can use a function to convert the duration to a plain number.  For example, if difference between the dates in in E4, and it's 10 days, then...\n=DUR2HOURS(E4) × 0.1\n\nShows a number, 24.0.

I'm trying to figure out what is taking up the room and how to clean it up somewhat.  I am used to PCs and Windows Explorer where I can just start at the root folder, right click to look at size and drill down to the offending folder(s).  I'm sure there is some straight forward way on the Mac.  I've researched this problem somewhat and have already cleared out movies, music and photos.  I've also run OmniDiskSweeper which clears up caches.  All that cleanup only recovered 1 or 2 gigabytes.  \nI find it hard to believe the disk is full.  I don't use it that often and I've only put a few things on (XCode, some GNU tools, Octave).  I'd like to clean it up for other stuff.  Under System info, the claim is that the disk is 121 GB flash, which is strange as I recall it being advertised as 160 but either I'm looking at the wrong place for the capacity or my memory is faulty.  Under that same system info (click on apple->About this mac->More Info->Storage it appears that the vast majority of disk space is taken up by \"Other\", which isn't too helpful.\nI am suspicious of the mail, but don't know how to check that.  I'll post a separate thread (Question about Mai. How to limit amount stored locally. Where is mail stored?)  for that as it's a stand alone question I'm interested in regardless of whether or not it is the culprit.\nSo in summary PLEASE tell me how to find out what is taking up the hard disk space and what I can clean off.  An ability to browse the disk would be helpful.  I'm somewhat comfortable with Unix/Linux on other system so I could do stuff by cmd line.  But at least on windows/pc, if you start removing folders without doing an uninstall, you can have problems.\nThanks!\nDave\n\nA: Disk Inventory X or WhatSize are both excellent apps for giving you a complete list of what's taking up space.  Also, as you described there is a way to start at the root and check the size of each folder, drilling down until you find the culprit.  Command-I or Get-Info from the the right click menu will show you the size of any folder or file you select.  \n\nA: There is a neat App called Disk Inventory X that I use personally that represents graphically the space taken by files and folders.\nhttp://www.derlien.com/index.html\n", "Q: Question about Mail. How to limit amount stored locally. Where is mail stored? I'm new to Macs and have a question about my MacBook Air OSX 10.9.1 and mail.  I'm getting a \"Startup disk full\" message* and one thing I highly suspect is the mail.  Even if it's not the culprit, I'm curious how things work.  I set up the Mail Application to get email from my Gmail and two Yahoo accounts.  As far as I can tell when I look at the Mail App, all my email I've ever received is there for me to look at.  \nIs the MacBook really downloading all the email?\nHow do I limit the email it downloads locally (to 2 weeks old and newer for example).\nWhere is the email stored on hard disk and can I delete it (without deleting on the Google and Yahoo Servers).\nIn the worst case, I'd be willing to simply remove the accounts from Mail and go back to simply looking at them through Safari. Will this remove the email from my local machine?  If not, how do I do it?\nI have attempted to research this and found some ideas on not storing mail locally.  See for example:\nhttp://www.cnet.com/news/tip-change-mail-settings-to-save-hard-drive-space/\nHowever, when I look at my system, I don't see this option and I'm guessing this is for an older version of MacOS.\nThanks,\nDave\n*My general question about disk storage is: Newbie question on getting back hard drive space\n\nA: Mail will be stored in ~/Library/Mail. Gmail and Yahoo typically use IMAP, which means the messages are held on their server until you delete them. Doubtful that this is what is eating up a big chunk of your drive space; my Mail folder weighs in at just under 9GB for nine accounts, one of which has messages going back 8+ years. There are a few options in Mail/Preferences/Accounts on how to handle mail storage, but nothing that will limit the time period for what mail messages are stored locally. Removing the accounts from Mail then expunging any of their associated files will clear up some space, but I'd be looking at other places for what is using disk space. Movies and music are big space hogs, for example.\n\nA: i removed my yahoo account from mail and deleted the mails and attachments from library/mail/ folder. Then emptied the trash. This Freed up over 20GB.\nI would have preferred to keep using Mail if I could limit the local storage to a few weeks worth but the programme does not allow any such option.  Another concern for me was that deleting the mails from the Mail application seems to suggest that they would be deleted from the Yahoo server. That would be a disaster for me. There was no option within the programme (that i could find) to delete the locally stored data only, hence my blunderbuss approach to closing the account and deleting it all from the computer. I would not delete the files without deactivating the account in Mail for fear of it later deleting my stored messages from Yahoo's server.\nA Good way to identify your memory hogs would be a program such as Grand Perspective which showed me that Mail and some GoPro videos were hogging 50GB of my 500GB disc and leaving me with the same 'startup disc full' message.\nNow that message is hopefully a thing of the past.\n", "Q: How to change the default behaviour of the fullscreen/maximize button? There is a question that deals with the different behaviour of the fullscreen button in the window bar. There, it is shown that by doing:\n⌥ + ⇧ + Click on green or outer right icon (plus icon)\nI can maximize a window in both width and height to the current screen.\nNow I am wondering if I can make this behaviour standard just by clicking the icon. For an extra bonus, I wonder if there is a keyboard shortcut to achieve the same thing.\n\nA: The question \"How do you maximize windows?\" was asked here, and user Am1rr3za offered the following, which will allow to you to override the default behavior of the maximize button to automatically maximize the window in both width and height:\n\nDownload and use RightZoom. It overrides your green plus (zoom) button and works like Windows maximize. You can add it to your login items in your user account to run every time you start OS X.\n\nThis software is free and it allows for custom key-bindings! \nAs for having to use Option + Shift + Left-Click to use the maximize feature:\nI have noticed that in order to have a screen maximized within the viewport without actually entering \"full screen/no distractions\" mode in Yosemite, I only need to hold the Option key and left-click the maximize button, and that's worked for everything I use on a daily basis: Finder, Chrome, Transmit, SublimeText 3, WebStorm, Outlook, iTerm 2, and even Photoshop CS5(which seems to give me some issues with sizing on my Mac). I don't think you need to hold the Shift key to achieve the screen maximization you're looking for!\n\nA: Spectacle has been discontinued. They recommend using Rectangle.\n\nUse spectacle, a free open source app that has a bunch of handy window management shortcuts.\nWhile it doesn't change the default behavior of the green button, it makes it superfluous for me to do so as I can do everything using keyboard shortcuts without using the mouse.\nFor full screen, press:\ncmd + option + F\nIt also has a bunch of options for 1/2 screen, 1/3 screen, top half, bottom half, etc.\n\n\nA: I found that BetterTouchTool solves this problem nicely (Note: BetterTouchTool is no longer free, the trial expires after 45 days). The Preferences aren't quite intuitive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Other\" category at the top of the window.\n\n*Make sure that \"Global\" is selected at the left side.\n\n*Click \"Configure New Trigger\" button in the bottom part of the window.\n\n*Select \"Leftclick Green Window Button\" as trigger.\n\n*Select \"Zoom Window Below Cursor\" as predefined action.\n\n*Enjoy!\n\n\n\nBetterTouchTool also allows defining a keyboard shortcut for this action (under \"Keyboard\"). However, the action will still be \"Zoom Window Below Cursor\" then - it will zoom whichever window your mouse cursor happens to be on, not the currently active window. So this isn't as helpful as it could be unfortunately.\n\nA: You can go to System Preferences -> Dock\nuncheck \"Double-click a window's title bar to minimize\"\nand then, when you double click on the title bar in a window, it will maximize the window without going into full screen mode.\nI find it easier than having to hold down the option key and clicking on the green button.\n\nA: I tried searching for hidden preference keys from the output of mdfind kMDItemContentType=public.unix-executable -onlyin /System|xargs strings 2>/dev/null|grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9.-]{10,80}$'|awk '!a[$0]++', but I couldn't find anything.\nYou can assign a shortcut for the Zoom menu item from System Preferences:\n\n\n\nA: ShiftIt is a free app that does a similar job to some of the others mentioned here: Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+F gives you full-screen.  It also does quarter screen, center, and move to next screen if you have multiple monitors. It requires XQuartz which does rather dwarf its <1Mb download. Hadn't come across Spectacle before; it may offer a more complete feature set.\nTo address another issue mentioned: the accessibility options are under Preferences/Security and Privacy/Accessibility, not the top-level accessibility.\n\nA: The behaviour of this green button can be changed using a tiny accessibility add-on. Follow the instructions at http://osxdaily.com/2015/03/11/change-the-green-button-maximize-behavior-in-os-x-yosemite-with-bettertouchtool/\nBasically, this application (once installed and authorized) with let you enhance the UI of OS X by allowing you to define new behaviours and modify existing ones. This adds for instance the window snapping capability to the Finder and also lets you define new gestures for the Magic Mouse and the Trackpad.\nThere is one little thing to know though, once you will modify the behaviour of the green button of the OS X window, this will not change the appearance of that button to make it look like a plus (+) instead of a fullscreen icon.\nIt allows also specifying modifier keys for mouse related action (ex. cmd + left click, ...)\n\nA: In System Preferences --> Dock: uncheck the option \"Double-click a window's title bar to minimize\". When you double-click the title bar, it maximizes the window without entering full screen mode.\n\nA: Better Touch Tool appears to be the easiest way to fix this.

I only changed the first three tables. The \"series\" is treated just like a book in these tables.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the books and the series in table ZBKSERIESCHECK. The table has 5 columns.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Z_PK is the primary key. It has to be a sequential number.\n\n*Z_ENT and Z_OPT I just completed with a \"1\".\n\n*ZDATECHECKED is just the date the row is created. In my case it was auto-assigned.\n\n*ZADAMID is a unique code for the book or series.\n\n\nThis is the table with the data I added.\n\nThe zAdamId I used are from Calibre, so I asume that you can use any number. Keep in mind that those numbers have to be different from the series/books you purchased.\nThe row with the zAdamId \"1\" is my series, the others are the books.\n\n*Add the relationships within books and series in the table ZBKSERIESITEM. This table has 16 columns.\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Z_PK, Z_ENT and Z_OPT are not the same ones defined in the previous table. Z_PK has to be sequential and, Z_ENT and Z_OPT I just completed with \"2\" and \"1\" respectively.\n\n*ZISCONTAINER defines if a zAdamId is a series or not. \"1\" is true, \"0\" is false.\n\n*ZPOSITION defines the number of a book in a series, starting with \"0\" for the first book.\n\n*ZADAMID is the same defined in the previous table for the same item.\n\n*ZAUTHOR is the author of the series/books.\n\n*ZGENRE is the genre of the series/books.\n\n*ZSEQUENCEDISPLAYNAME defines how a book is displayed as a member of a series. For example, for the first book, you can define \"Book 1\" or \"Volume 1\" or \"Vol.1\". This string is going to be prepended to the name of the book. This column has to be empty for the series.\n\n*ZSERIESADAMID is the series zAdamId of the book. For the series, this is the same as ZADAMID.\n\n*ZSERIESTITLE is the name of the series.\n\n*ZSORTTITLE and ZTITLE is the name of the book or series.\n\n\n\n\n*Adjust table Z_PRIMARYKEY.\nI found that this table has only two rows. One for each of the previous tables.\n\nHere you have to change the Z_MAX column to the MAX(*) value of the Z_PK in each of the previous tables. For instance, in my DB, for the table ZBKSERIESCHECK (BKSeriesCheck) the MAX(*) of the column Z_PK is \"22\".\n\n*Save the changes.\n\n*Open the Books.plist file. Look for each of the books of the series and add these keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*seriesAdamId as Number with the value of ZBKSERIESITEM~ZSERIESADAMID.\n\n*itemId as Number with the value of ZBKSERIESITEM~ZADAMID.\n\n*seriesSequenceNumber as String with the value of ZBKSERIESITEM~ZPOSITION + 1. (Remember that in the table it starts with \"0\".)\n\n*seriesTitle as String with the value of ZBKSERIESITEM~ZTITLE.\n\n\n\n\n*Save the file. Close iBooks (if you didn't close it from the beginning). Kill the com.apple.BKAgentService process. Start iBooks. You should be able to see your series.\n\nNotes\nThose columns I didn't name, I just left them empty and it didn't affect the end result.\nI think it's waaay to difficult to put all your books and series properly when you have a lot of them. Hope to see someday something that do all this auto-magically.\nThis is my first post. I hope everybody finds it useful.\n\nA: I noticed that, in iBooks, I have a book (Inheritance) which iBooks highlights as a member of a series (in my case called 'Eragon' instead of 'The Farseer Trilogy'). In order to investigate this, I downloaded Inheritance and stripped the DRM using Requiem (on an old virtual machine) so I could poke about in the source code of the book.\nUnfortunately, I have bad news. I used Sigil to search for the word 'Eragon'. The word 'Eragon' appears nowhere in the metadata within the epub, indicating that this is not possible; iBook evidently maintains series information separate to the actual epub files.\n\nA: I tried it myself, and found out, that the playlist in same folder that stores the epubs has informations about the book series. There are the metadata seriesTitle and\nseriesSequenceNumber set. But unfortunately changing it there does´t make Ibooks to list books as series.\nAlso setting Metadata in the e-book itself saying series Title and seriesSequenceNumber is not working. \nThen I found a folder in usr.

They can upload images and animation-videos there.\nNow, if a co-worker has uploaded many files, it would be nice to download all of them all at once. \nSo I have a webpage with, lets say, 20 links. All of them are linking to files to another folder. \n\nIs there a PlugIn or anything to click once which follows the links\n  and downloads the files?\n\n\nA: I have found this software for my own use just now and then I remembered your question. That's what I have found, perhaps that can help you :\nFolx\nFolx is a free download manager for Mac OS X with a true Mac-style interface. \nIt offers convenient downloads managing, flexible settings, etc. \nFolx has a unique system of sorting and keeping the downloaded content.\n\n\niGetter\n\nSite Explorer allows exploration of the entire web or FTP sites, so\n  you can easily find and download files you're interested in. To\n  explore a HTTP, HTTPS or FTP site select the Site Explorer group item\n  and choose the contextual menu function \"Enter Site URL\" to set a site\n  URL. When you reach the file that you want to download double click on\n  it or choose the contextual menu function \"Add to queue\" and it will\n  appear in the queue for download. If you want to cancel the processing\n  just push the \"Pause\" button on the Toolbar. Site Explorer analyzes\n  HTML pages for all available links even looking in the JavaScript\n  functions, so it will show a complete list of web page contents.\n\n\n\n\nAnd I've found the following, when I was searching about your question:\nHow can I download all MP3 files from a web site?\nSiteSucker is a great (free) application! It will allow you to download folders from a site. So, just enter in your URL and click \"Download\"\n\n\nSiteSucker is a Macintosh application that automatically downloads Web sites from the Internet. It does this by asynchronously copying the site's Web pages, images, backgrounds, movies, and other files to your local hard drive, duplicating the site's directory structure. Just enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), press return, and SiteSucker can download an entire Web site.\n\n\nA: Use the command line tool wget for this. If you don't have wget installed, install it using the instructions here. \nTo download all linked files from a url, run a command like \nwget --recursive --no-clobber --no-parent www.example.com/page/\n\nThe --recursive option tells wget to follow links. The --no-clobber means only download each linked file once, and --no-parent prevents wget from following links that lead up to a parent directory--generally not what you want. \nMore information is available in the docs. \n\nA: Here is another alternative, similar to that one of Foxl.\nUpdate: August 2019\nBoth browser plugins have been discontinued and their functionally is now part of Download Shuttle Pro (paid version). The plugins can still be downloaded in the official support page. For newer versions of Safari, one might have to find ways to go around the imposed \"unsafe extension\" limitation.\n\nOriginal answer below\nDownload Shuttle is a simple and lightweight download manager for macOS. It works as a stand-alone or as a browser extension. It comes with plugins for Safari and Chrome.\n\nDownload Shuttle is a blisteringly fast download accelerator and manager, and it’s free! All downloads made via Download Shuttle are multi-segmented, i.e., each file is split into many smaller parts that are simultaneously being downloaded. This ensures that the speeds you experience are a lot faster as your bandwidth is maximized.\n\n\nIt is free. I find it more easy to use than Foxl. When compared to Foxl's free version, it also has the advantage of not having ads or popups that ask you to buy the full version.\nIt is being updated (apps and extensions) as of 2017.\nTested on macOS 10.12.5 and Safari 10.1.1.\n\nA: Chrome/Firefox Browser answer.  Chrome/Firefox can use the HTML5 download attribute.\nAs Far as I know Safari does not support it yet.\nSince you are building the web pages. You can add the download attribute to the links and also give them a class name that will help you find them.\nYou then use a button that runs a javascript function that will simulate clicking the links which use download attribute to force the files to download instead of opening.\nExample.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n\n    <title>test</title>\n\n     <script>\n\n     function downloadURLS() {\n\n         var links = document.getElementsByClassName(\"downloadLnk\");\n         for(var i=0; i<links.length; i++) {\n\n             links[i].click();\n         }\n\n     }\n\n\n         </script>\n\n  </head>\n  <body>\n\n     <p>\n<!--     add the download attribute, and add the class name downloadLnk -->\n<!--The download attribute will work in Chrome, but as of yet not Safari-->\n     <a class=\"downloadLnk\" href=\"subdir/1.jpeg\"  download > image link</a>\n     </a>\n     </p>\n\n     <p>\n     <a class=\"downloadLnk\" href=\"subdir/2.jpeg\"  download > image link</a>\n     </a>\n     </p>\n\n     <p>\n     <a class=\"downloadLnk\" href=\"subdir/3.jpeg\"  download > image link</a>\n     </a>\n     </p>\n\n     <div>\n         <button onclick=\"downloadURLS()\">download all</button>\n\n     </div>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nAlso not that the images are in a sub directory.\nWorking Example page\n", "Q: Spotlight search returns no results on iOS (intermittently) I'm on 8.0.2 but it happened on 8.0.0 too. \n\nSpotlight just won't show anything no matter what I type. \n\nA: I have this to they only resolution so far is either go old turn off and on again or reboot then seems to work again. Do you use other keyboards too? because I thought it was linked to this.\n\nA: Send yourself an email from the iPhone to your iPhone email address\nYes seriously. I know that sounds absurd, but sending your iOS device an email actually makes Spotlight search start working again. All you need to do is send yourself an email to whatever mail account is setup on the iOS device, and once the new email is detected by iOS Mail app (as indicated by a Notification or the new mail chime), suddenly Spotlight works again.\n\nA: Problem exists in 8.1.2 as well.\nWhen this sporadic behaviour appears even a reboot of the device will not always fix this. \nThe only thing that helped so far is waiting a few minutes and then spotlight suddenly magically works again properly.\nUnfortunately I didn't find anything close at http://openradar.appspot.com/ so it seems this issue is quite infrequent\nEDIT: Yes I got an gif keyboard installed ;)\n\nA: Same problem with iOS 8.3. The only thing that seemed to help was to reboot the phone. Then search results were as they should be. This doesn't last, however, and needs to be done again after a while.

My office is looking to get a Mac Mini for testing our website in Safari. Because Apple now allows you to run previous versions of OS X in a VM, we will be looking to run at least Mavericks and Mountain Lion VMs on a Yosemite host. We're going w/ the Mini's because we'll be stuffing the box in the server room (or somewhere) and connecting remotely from our Windows developer PCs.\nBecause the Mac Minis hadn't been updated in awhile and we figured an update was coming, we were holding out until Apple announced them at the big event last Thursday. However, now that they have, we've noticed that the quad-core Mac Mini is no longer available!\nThis has left me wondering: For the task of running two or three OS X VMs, would we be better served getting a newer, faster dual-core 2014 model? Or would we be better served by having more cores in the 2012 quad-core?\nThe box will most likely not be used for any other purpose, so we aren't as concerned w/ the performance of the 3D chip or other factors. We just want good VM performance.\nThanks.\n\nA: As a test server with multiple VM running, definitely quad core is much better than dual-core.

After update to Yosemite, the guest account was to inherit the settings of the main. It is possible to set the audio output by default for all accounts except one of them?\nUPD: I did some tests and came to the conclusion that the system now does not remember settings for each user, and applies the current setting of audio output for all accounts.\n\nA: I'm having a similer issue.

After goolging I've found this post in the Apple forums:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/26929324#26929324\nSummary of the post (detailed instructions are in the post)\nThe bug could be due to a memory leak in the video memory.

I want to create 1 RAID10 of 4 x 4TB disks. Since RAID10, if I'm correct, is a striped set of mirrored sets, can I install the 2 new 4 TB disks, mirror them, then create the RAID10 by striping them together with the existing RAID1? (I would then copy the data from the current striped set over to the new RAID10.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Will Disk Utility allow this without erasing the data? I'm guessing it would have to copy half the data over to the new mirror.\n\n\nA: Sorry, no. I am not aware of any utility, Mac, PC, Linux, whatever that will allow you to convert a RAID volume to another type while adding more disks to the mix.\nYour only option is to back up your data, and set up the RAID that you need to, which will wipe the drives.\nBTW not sure if Apple supports RAID-10 out of the box, perhaps someone else who knows for sure can chime in.

I need to upgrade Safari to version 7 to run some tests for a particular application. However, in order to upgrade Safari I need to upgrade to Mavericks.\nUnfortunately, that is easier said than done since Yosemite just came out. I did some checking and found that Yosemite is running Safari 8, which will not work for the tests I need to run. \nAre any of the following options possible?\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Safari installed on Mountain Lion\n\n*Upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks\n\n*Upgrade to Yosemite and then downgrade Safari to version 7\n\n\nUpdate:\nI do need it to actually be Safari 7 for my tests.

If you don't have any sharing services running than it is of no consequence and would be equivalent of a firewall not allowing multicast traffic from your Mac.\nBecause you did not completly disable Bonjour you will still benefit from seeing others on the network and cloaking of the \".local\" domain in DNS.

If you're backing-up any external HDs, they'll be excluded automatically, so remove those exclusions.  If you're not sure how to do that, see Time Machine FAQ #10.\nNote:  If you're backing-up to an external HD, it's shown automatically, in gray, and you can't remove it.  Any drives or partitions that aren't formatted for a Mac can't be backed-up by Time Machine, so they'll also be shown in gray, and can't be removed.\nThe oldest and latest backup dates won't appear on this window until the next backup is done. \"None\" does not mean the backups are lost, just that the dates haven't been re-loaded.\n  \n*A 120-second countdown to a backup should appear.

After upgrading I noticed that I was unable to connect to the internet at home, but presumed it was a random issue and switched it off. On bringing my MacBook into my work I noticed that it would also not connect to the internet connection in work ether via both WiFi and cabled connections, though I could still connect to LAN devices.\nThe odd thing is that when using the System Recovery screen the internet connection appears to work fine as it was downloading the Yosemite image to reinstall it (though this kept failing because of too many people attempting to download the new release so was unable to attempt a reinstall) which makes me think its more of an issue something added to the recent OS upgrade.\nDoes anyone else have this issue, or know how to fix it?\n\nA: Resolved the issue by clean installing the OS.\n\nA: Turned off \"Automatic proxy discovery\" on home network with double firewalls and no proxy. Now the internet is back.\n\nA: A friend of mine had this happening to him after he upgraded to Mavericks. I managed to fix it by going to 'Network Preferences', then for the desired network open go to TCP/IP, and then choose 'Renew DHCP lease'. \nHe had to do this for every network that his computer previously knew, but only once.\n\nA: I installed Yosemite under a non-admin profile on my iMac. I went into the Admin profile and made the profile I installed Yosemite under an admin as well. That seems to have fixed my connectivity issue for now.\n\nA: I also installed Yosemite from a user profile.

I currently use my iPod for little other than music, podcasts, and games.\nSpecifically, my question is, if I change to iCloud Drive, will my apps and games on my iPod no longer be able to save what files they save using legacy iCloud?\n\nA: It appears that if you upgrade to iCloud Drive, you won't be able to sync any game data with your iOS 8 devices. As an upgrade to iCloud Drive will no longer allow your older iOS 6 iPod to view or edit Documents in iCloud (which I assume includes game data).\nSource: this MacRumors forum\n", "Q: How do I Launch an Applescript with a Hotkey Without Automator?

Is there a way to do as such, preferably without installing software that runs in the background?\n\nA: I found Automator's \"Launch Application\" action to be as quick as anything else, and the only way to do this without third party software.\nBetterTouchTool is a free application that can be used to launch applications using hotkeys.\niTerm 2 is a Terminal.app replacement that can be shown/hidden using a hotkey (if it's running).\n", "Q: Cannot login directly into user account - first have to login as administrator I updated my Macbook to 10.9 Yosemite, and at the same time I encrypted the user data partition. The system partition was already encrypted. I use an administrator account with admin rights, and a user account without admin rights, for normal use. \nThe admin account is on the system disk, the user account is on the user partition, using a symlink in /Users. This setup worked with 10.8, system partition encrypted, user partition not. \nNow it turns out that when I startup the computer, I cannot login with the user account. First I have to login as administrator, then I logout, then I can login with the user account. \nOf course this is not what I want. How can I fix the login process so I can login directly into the user account? \n\nA: We've seen this behavior before when we migrate a user account onto a computer that already has FileVault disk encryption enabled, because the new user's login password isn't eligible to decrypt the disk at boot time. \nWe resolve it in that case by bringing up the Security preference pane, which contains a warning that not all users are eligible to decrypt the disk, and steps you through fixing it (by providing the additional user's login password). \nI'm not sure if this also applies to symlinked home directories, but it's the first thing I'd check.\n", "Q: Free space after Yosemite install? I came from OSX Mavericks, and since the update to Yosemite I gained 20+ Gigabytes of space.  I would usually expect to lose space.  Did the update delete some files that I am not aware of?\n\nA: As you know OS makes a lot files during its uses.\nMany of those are hidden files or Cache or Temp files but all related to the specific OS.\nWhen new OS is installed it takes over those (deletes most of them) and starts making its own ones.\nFor example the Terminal command\nopen $TMPDIR../C/\n\nwill show you the cached files/folders, but this will only show the non hidden ones. I have some 3 Gig of stuff in there.\nOS will hide system files and ones it creates in due process to protect them, but they can be made visible if one wants to do that.\nI can not say what specific files new OS install will remove but they must be specific to a previous OS and no longer needed by new OS since it will create its own versions of them.\n\nA: Could it be that installing Yosemite \"purged\" backups prepared when you were still on Mavericks? It did that with my machine at least. \nIt could be that as part of the upgrade process, backups prepared on the previous OS version are pruned.\nApple's KB on the minimum requirements for OS X Mavericks states:\n\nYour Mac also needs:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*OS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed\n  \n*2 GB or more of memory\n  \n*8 GB or more of available space\n\nThe Wikipedia page for OS X Yosemite indicates the systems need approximately  the same amount of free space:\n\nAll Macintosh products capable of running OS X Mavericks are supported by Yosemite; as with Mavericks, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB of available storage, and OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later are required. However, the system requirements in order to take full advantage of the features of Handoff include a Mac with Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0), and other currently unknown factors.\n\nSo unless you're noticing some pretty big files missing, I don't think difference in OS size can account for the freed-up space. Given that your system is behaving normally, I'd say Mavericks TM backups were deleted as part of the Yosemite installation process.\n", "Q: Empty iCloud Drive folder in Yosemite?

I have a 27\" iMac hooked up to 27\" Thunderbolt display, providing me with a standard dual monitor configuration. Both the iMac and the secondary monitor were purchased on the same day in early 2012.\nApple recently released a 5k iMac which I plan to purchase. I'd like to swap out my old iMac for this new one, and hook up this new iMac to my existing Thunderbolt monitor so as to retain the dual monitor configuration.\nWill this work? I realize that the secondary Thunderbolt monitor will not support the new 5k video format, seeing as how it was made back in 2012. But will it at least run properly at its own native max resolution? Are there any downsides (e.g. eyestrain, etc.) with having a dual monitor configuration wherein one monitor has a significantly higher resolution that the other?\n\nA: Your dual monitor setup will still work fine, and they will both stay at their native resolution.\nThe only issue is that you might have the borders will not match up, since 5k is (probably) a lot more than what you had before, so it will be a lot larger. When mousing from your old monitor to your new monitor, you will have no problems, but when mousing back you might hit a boundary on the top or bottom. You can configure where the boundary is, so it shouldn't be a huge problem.\n", "Q: Best Practices for dealing with unbrewed files in a fresh install of homebrew I accidentally deleted /usr/local/bin which contained brew among other things.

After first informing them that Apple has 'announced' via the above post that Workgroup Manager is no longer being updated, he then checked something and advised me Workgroup Manager should still work in Yosemite (it doesn't, at least not according to my testing so far).\nHe also suggested fill in the relevant Apple Feedback form http://www.apple.com/feedback/server.html start a campaign, bring back Workgroup Manager!\nHad I known in advance OSX Server 10.7 - 10.9 in general would be so flaky I would not have spent £££1,000s on a new Mac server. Now I can no longer risk an upgrade because of Workgroup Manager. Annoying, but you live and learn.\n\nA: I agree that sending feedback to http://www.apple.com/feedback/server.html is probably our best chance of getting Workgroup Manager (or an adequate replacement) made available. Many key/essential multi-user lab management tools are not possible with Profile Manager.

The handoff is well configured because I am able to see an icon appear in the dock when I use the notes app.\nWhat can I do to make this functionality work again?\nThanks\n\nA: Also check the OS X settings: Messages > Preferences > Accounts.\nIn my case the Messages app had disabled my AppleID account and enabled a new Google Jabber account.\n\nA: You need to wait for the iOS 8.1 update in order to be able to do SMS from your computer / iPad. It should be available for you now or tomorrow if you go to \"settings -> general -> software update\"\nEDIT: \"iPhone Settings -> Messages -> Text Message Forwarding\" then select your device that you want to send from and enable it :)\nRestart messages on OSX if it's still not working.\n\nA: I had this issue, but quitting iMessage and relaunching iMessage fixed it.\n\nA: The contact you are trying to text via iMessage needs to re-enable (or re-register) iMessage on their freshly updated iPhone.  This happened to my wife and I.\nThe contact in question needs to go to Settings --> Messages and move the slider to enable iMessage:\n\n\nA: I just had this problem, and I figured it out! I tried all of the above solutions, but to no avail. Both my computer and phone are updated with the latest versions of software. Anyways, you should check your iPhone messages section (in the Settings app), where it says \"Text Message Forwarding.\" Make sure the slider is slid to green for it to allow messaging from computer or iPad, then your texts will send fine to everyone. I just sent a few messages to people that I couldn't access a few minutes ago. Hopefully this helps someone out there! \n\nA: You have to use your friends email that's registered as their Apple account.\n\nA: Make sure you type the number in the right format. For the US, type +1XXXYYYZZZZ (XXX=Area Code, YYY=Prefix, ZZZZ=Suffix).\n", "Q: Sync Contacts between iPhones with different Apple IDs Until recently my wife and I shared one Apple ID to allow us to have synced calendars and contacts.  The only thing she used her ID for was the Messages app.  When I learned that I could set her phone up with both of our IDs and then choose which one it pulls from for each item I changed to this approach.  So now the only things turned on for my ID on her phone are Calendars and Contacts.\nThis works great other than on her phone under the \"Contacts\" heading of \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" it has my info selected.  If she changes it on her phone it will update mine as well.\nDoes anyone have a better solution for how we can sync our contacts book (other than using a 3rd-party service like Google)?  Thanks.\n-James\n\nA: Someone on the Apple Forums explained that I need to turn on Contacts for both Apple ID accounts on my wife's phone.  This will allow us to have different \"My Info\" cards while still syncing contact changes.\n\nA: Suppose a husband and wife want to share contacts. In Settings > iCloud, the husband adds his account. In it, he must sync contacts; he can also sync whatever else he wants.\nIn Settings > iCloud, the wife adds her account. In it, she cannot sync contacts, but she can sync whatever else she wants. In Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars, she adds her husband's account. In it, the only thing she syncs is contacts.\nThis answer is a dupe of How do I sync contacts between 2 iCloud accounts with iOS 8?.\n\nA: *\n\n*Login to iCloud.com with first Apple ID, go to Contacts, select all contacts, then use Settings in the bottom left corner to invoke Export as vCard. Remember the directory where you saved the vCard file.\n\n*Sign out of the iCloud.com\n\n*Sign in to iCloud using another Apple ID account where you want to copy the contacts.\n\n*Go to Contacts, click on Settings and invoke Import vCard, point to the directory where you saved Contacts in step 1, this should import all the contacts to the second account. \n\n*Just wait, on the device with second Apple ID the Contacts will shortly appear.\n\n", "Q: How do I install Mavericks now that Yosemite has been released? I have a late 2009 iMac running Mountain Lion, I also have a Macbook Pro running Mavericks. I have been planning on installing Mavericks on the iMac, but now that Yosemite has been released, Mavericks is no longer available on the Mac App store. \nHow can I install Mavericks on the iMac? As you can guess, I'm not an early-adoptor, so not interested in installing Yosemite for now.\nEven though I have a Macbook Pro with Mavericks, it came installed with Mavericks, so it is not in my Mac App store 'Purchases', but 'Mountain Lion' is.\n\nA: Take it to the Genius Bar. They have installers for every OS. \n\nA: So if I'm comprehending your question correctly you want to be able to downgrade back to Mavericks.\nYou will have to download or torrent it externally without Apple's permission but seeing as it was a free upgrade when it was available there should be no problem.\nThat being said here's a (broken) link to a download of a bootable DMG file.\nLink: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11054371/OS_X_Mavericks_10.9.5_(13F34)_bootable_USB_(DMG_File)#filelistContainer\nAlso you will need a USB Flash Drive of 8GB or higher.\nAnd if you want to you can use Time Machine to backup your Macs files and preferences to an external drive.\nHere's a link to a helpful video on that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgYqcL7_0BI\nNow onto the good stuff:\nOnce the torrent is downloaded open Disk Utility.\nSelect your flash drive from the list.\nClick the 'Erase' tab.\nClick the dropdown next to Format and select 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)'.\nThen in the name box you can put whatever name you want.\nThen click Erase and confirm it as well.\nBEWARE AS IT SOUNDS IT DOES ERASE ALL OF YOUR DATA FROM THE FLASH DRIVE!\nOnce it's finished select the partition that has the name your entered and click the 'Restore' tab.\nLocate the file you downloaded earlier and drag it into the 'Source' box.\nand then drag the partition you made into the 'Destination' box.\nClick the 'Restore' button in the bottom right.\nThen let the magic happen. :)\nOnce its finished shut down the Mac and turn it on again while holding the 'option' key until the grey screen WITH the drives to select pops up.\nSelect the drive you made and it should boot into a recovery-like drive.\nFrom there you should be able to format the drive with Disk Utility and reinstall Mavericks.\n\nA: It looks like you can still get Mountain Lion here: http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion\n\nA: As far as I understand, if it's not in your purchased items list, you'll need to download the installer from an alternate source. Get it from the friend, or a trustworthy online source.\nApple might put it up for sale eventually (or for free) like they've done with Mountain Lion, Lion, and Snow Leopard. You can still buy those from store.apple.com\n", "Q: How to bring back multi-touch gestures after it crashes without reboot? After a clean install of Yosemite, multi-touch gestures have stopped working on two occasions on my Macbook Pro 2011. Each time, the symptoms are the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gestures stopped working both built-in trackpad and bluetooth trackpad.\n\n*BetterTouchTool still works. Restarting, stopping BTT doesn't help.\n\n*Hey, at least two-finger click -> right click still works.\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggling trackpad configurations doesn't bring back the gestures.\n\n*Disconnecting, reconnecting, removing bluetooth trackpad from list of bluetooth devices doesn't work.\nRestarting solves the problem. However, a restart in my case is a time-consuming process. It involves properly shutting down apps, dismounting network storage, disconnecting VPN, etc - only to revert all the steps again on startup.\nI suspect the process interpreting multi-touch crashed when the malfunction happened. CPU was quite busy at both point. So I wonder if there is a process I can call up when it happens again, to avoid restarting the machine. \n\nA: I found a faster solution. In settings → trackpad, disable all scroll and zoom gestures, then reenable them. The trackpad should start working again almost immediately (at least it did when I tried it).\nAnother solution that works in macOS Ventura is to lock your Mac by pressing control+command+Q, and then press the escape key to turn off the display. After you unlock your Mac, the gestures should work again.\n\nA: Sleep is useful, however, not always preferred for me as I have some tasks running, listening to music or whatever may be.\nKilling the dock or the apps haven't worked, unfortunately.\nI have found that with Sierra I am able to get the swiping back with force quitting hidd (Human Interface Device Deamon) multiple times (restarts automatically).\nEdit:\nAfter finding out about this AskDifferent answer I was able to narrow down the issue to Magnet. Quitting its process, I have not had the issue repeat in 2 hours.\n\nA: killall Dock did not work for me.  \npmset displaysleepnow; sleep 5; caffeinate -u -t 1 did not work for me.\nsudo killall hidd did work for me on OSX 10.13.6 (17G4015).\n\nA: Run the command killall Dock in Terminal.\nIn my case, only Mission Control gestures had stopped working (three finger swipe left/right to switch spaces, three finger swipe up for overview, mission control etc).\n\nA: By my experience, multi-touch crashes on a per-app basis. I could quit the app and relaunch it, and gestures would be back.\nApparently, sleeping the display and then waking up the system again will bring back crippled gesture. You can click button to do that, or just close the lid, or use terminal:\npmset displaysleepnow; sleep 5; caffeinate -u -t 1\n\nAfter one second of black screen, gestures are back.\n(P.S.: I'm answering my question here, so if it works for you, upvote and I will mark it as accepted)\n\nA: Hit the same issue. Found this old thread, where user frimp advises to press power button and let MBP sleep for a while, some 5-10 seconds is enough. Then wake it up — gestures are back.\nFurther search shows this issue is quite old, at least since mid 2012.\nThough I would really like to get this fixed permanently…\n\nA: I'm having the same issue periodically only since upgrading to Yosemite (I did not do a clean install.) For me it has been affecting only 4 finger swipes (all 4 directions are completely unrecognized) on both the built-in trackpad and on a BT magic trackpad.\nInterestingly, the problem went away for me (at least for the moment) without a reboot after I killed a process that was misbehaving.  I saw errors in the console once per second with the following text: assertion failed: 14A389: libxpc.dylib + 40320  For me these messages are attributed to the Spokes app (a Plantronics helper application for my headset), though I have seen it reported for other different applications on Yosemite as well.\nIt may be anecdotal that the gestures started working again after I killed the offending app, but I'll watch to see if there's a correlation in the future, since this problem has come and gone a few times since my upgrade and it's not my first time killing this app nor my first time with gestures resuming without a reboot.\n\nA: One trick which I learnt about from a similar problem here using Steam. \nCreate a copy of the \"BetterTouchTool.app\" and call it something like \"BetterTouchTool2.app\". When it stops working, just open \"BetterTouchTool2.app\". This should allow you to continue using it without a restart.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks vs Yosemite Performance I am using a 2013 MacBook Air and considering to upgrade from 10.9 to 10.10. Is there a performance gain after the upgrade? Is Yosemite faster than Mavericks, say, regarding UI responsiveness?\n\nA: Quick answer: NO. Yosemite isn't faster than Mavericks.\nI don't say that the performance is worse. The oldest is the computer most noticeable is the difference. But, on a 2013 computer, it should be the same, or nearly the same, on both machines. Anyway, there are things you can do to improve it (How to Improve OS X Yosemite Performance).\nWhat I noticed, is that is quite more efficiently on batteries.\n\nA: I have recently upgraded a 2012 MacBook Air from Mavericks to Yosemite, and I have not noticed any change in responsiveness or speed.  I didn't do any measurements, but the performance difference (at least on my system) is small enough that it is unnoticeable to me.\n\nA: UI responsiveness is worse or at least it's getting worse while my macbook is running without restart for longer period. Especially if you don't check the \"Reduce transparency\" option in Accessibility settings the performance is noticeably worse. (on macbook pro 13\" late 2013)\n\nA: From a purely anecdotal experience, I haven't noticed much of a difference between Mavericks and Yosemite on my 2011 Macbook Air (i5). The only exception may be the animation for expanding stacks and fans being slightly less smooth, but this may just be me being hypersensitive to finding performance differences.\nIf you find that your Mac is significantly slower or less responsive after the update you may want to backup and do a clean install. I've had good results of doing an upgrade-installs with my Macs in general, but sometimes they can result in a more sluggish system compared to a clean install.\n\nA: I do have lots and lots of UI responsiveness problems with Yosemite that I don’t have with Mavericks.\nI have a 16GB Mid-2012 rMBP (first Retina MBP) and boy! is Yosemite sluggish! Fun fact: Mavericks used to being as sluggish when it first came out… Apple did enhance it.\nI do have a lot of Spaces opened all the time (around 6, not counting fullscreen apps), but with (almost) the same apps opened on Mavericks and Yosemite, Yosemite is way slower. And it gets slower and slower as the uptime grows.\nMy advice: wait for OS X 10.10.3 or such (at least 10.10.2). Let Apple optimise its OS.\n\nA: I used to have Mavericks installed on my machine (a 2012 macmini with 2.5ghz i5, 16GB RAM), then I upgraded to Yosemite. I didn't notice any significant difference in performance in terms of UI responsiveness. \nBut it seems to me quite clear that Yosemite is using more RAM to cache a lot of stuff. The boot up process seems to also take quite long on Yosemite. Safari is noticeably faster on Yosemite than it was on previous systems.\nMy fastest system in terms of responsiveness is a Mountain Lion installed on a separate partition with swapping disabled. Unfortunately I didn't find a way to disable swapping on Yosemite too, so I can get a better use for the 16GB of RAM.\nIn many ways Yosemite feels like a better system, though, and I wouldn't go back to any previous system, even though there is no significant improvement in terms of functionality (it's mostly UI changes).\n\nA: I would like to add, as a concerned guy with performance, that since Mavericks my MacBook Air 2013's boot time has increased a lot! I measured the boot time 3 times with a stopwatch and calculated the average, so here are the results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mountain Lion: 11.0 seconds\n\n*Mavericks: 18.0 seconds\n\n*Yosemite: 22.0 seconds\n\n\nI don't like the idea that every time Apple releases a new OS X, the boot time increases. One of the reasons I chose Mac was because it was fast! I was able to push the power button and get to work in 10 seconds, now I'm not. I'm not very fond of Linux, but my Ubuntu boots in 15 seconds and it's the latest version of Ubuntu. If I need to do something as quickly as possible, which one do you think I would turn on? Yosemite or Ubuntu? = /\nI miss Mountain Lion, it's the best OS X in my opinion. I just hope Macs don't take 1 minute to load like Windows in the next OS.\n\nA: I have a macbook air mid 2013 and Yosemite is 100% my favourite OS X so far. It is worth trying it out only because of giant jump in performance of safari. I also recently installed Yosemite on macbook late 2008 with hdd and 2gb ram, after upgrading to 4gb ram I could fully enjoy the fresh OS X even on the old machine. However I did notice that turning on time takes a little longer than using mavericks. I would strongly suggest switching to Yosemite as most of the time we spend with the browser, unless your job requires otherwise. Definitely worth giving a try.\n\nA: So, I am running a Macbook pro late 2011 with upgrade to a Samsung SSD ,instead of the normal HDD.\nThat being said, I can tell you that after changing form Mavericks to Yosemite, I'v been really happy with the way it runs!\nI will make a list of pro's and con's so it will be easy for you to read.\nPRO's:\n1. Safari is insanely cool! \n2. Notification center is now similar to the iOS's notification center and I find it really useful! \n3. The design is smooth and nice to look at.A bit better than Maverick's design.\n4. Slightly bigger battery life -still a big plus.At least 30 minutes more battery life.\n5. Overal cooler user-experience.\nCON's\n1. The laptop boots a bit faster than it did before -I get like 4 seconds boot time up to the password stage, but after I write my password, it takes about 10 seconds to load the UI completely.\n2. Had slight problem with the Mail app\nBeen using Yosemite a few days and overall experience was awesome!\nTotally recommended!\n\nA: When I compare Yosemite with Mavericks, The system is very slower with Yosemite\nThe translucent graphics require much more CPU power and system working very slower. It will be better to select \"Reduce Translucency\" option from System Preferences -> Accessibility to increase the system performance \nPlus there are many bugs exist in the program. The geographical location system and related systems are always crushing and system is stalling \nIf you run the Activity Monitor... You will realize that, OS X Yosemite is full of Bugs\nFinally, It's for these reasons that I decided to return back to my old Mavericks...\n\n\nA: As of my own experience, Yosemite doesn't seem that much slower than Mavericks on executing operations (I have a MacBook Pro mid-2010).\nWhat is way slower though is UI responsiveness especially for Finder's windows. My main gripe is with Window Resizing, which respond as fast as a slideshow. In 10.10.0, Icon view and List view were acceptable. Column view was unbearable. Since 10.10.2, I noticed all three views are suffering from the same problem.\nOne way to fix this is indeed to Reduce Transparency (System Preferences / Accessibility / Display) but also to Always Show scroll bars  (System Preferences / General).\nWhat is funny though is that I booted Parallels Desktop with Windows 7 while still using Yosemite and Windows 7 was more responsive even running as a Virtual Machine. That shows that there is a real problem on the software side from Apple.\nAll and all, Yosemite is a great update, feature-wise. I would advice to stay away from it for now if you can't stand those issues.\n\nA: I've been running Yosemite since it came out, with the updates and I'm finding that its boot time is unacceptable. I'm seeing 30+ seconds of totally blank screen and then longer with the logo and the progress bar - I'd guess the startup time before I can log in is between 1.5 and 2 minutes.\nSo - yes, startup is now firmly in the old Windows territory and is completely pathetic when compared to my Samsung XE, Surface Pro 3 and a bog-standard dual core Pentium machine - all of which run Win8/8.1 and all boot to a login within 20 seconds!\nI'm seriously considering backing up all my data off the iMac (2012) - and going back to an earlier version - maybe Mountain Lion - until Apple gets their act together!\n", "Q: difference between tty[p,r,s][N] and pts $ ps -ef | grep tty | grep root | grep \"-sh\"\nroot 25185 25184  0  Oct 14  ttyp4     0:00 -sh\nroot 22998 22997  0  Oct 14  ttyp2     0:00 -sh\nroot 25379 25378  0  Oct 13  ttyp0     0:00 -sh\nroot  1709  1708  0  Oct 13  ttyrf     0:00 -sh\nroot 27558 27552  0  Oct 14  ttyp5     0:00 -sh\nroot 28955 28954  0  Oct  1  ttys5     0:00 -sh\nroot 12124 12123  0  Oct 13  ttyq9     0:00 -sh\nroot 16255 16254  0  Oct  8  ttys8     0:00 -sh\nroot 13731 13729  0  Oct 13  ttyq1     0:00 -sh\nroot 24695 24694  0  Oct  8  ttys9     0:00 -sh\nroot 26969 26968  0  Oct  7  ttys7     0:00 -sh\nroot  3625  3624  0  Oct 15  ttyp6     0:00 -sh\nroot 22387 22385  0  Oct 13  ttys0     0:00 -sh\nroot  7946  7945  0  Oct  8  ttysb     0:00 -sh\nroot  1071  1070  0  Oct  1  ttys6     0:00 -sh\n\nwhen I log in using SSH I get pts/1 let's saybut I do not understand why there are those root ttys[N]. Somewhere on google I found that it is equivalent to pts but the second question, why two different names for pseudoterminal? And the third question is for the command part of the ps output, is it just a pseudoterminal for sh (shell)?\n\nA: OS X, like other UNIX-iod systems, implements two systems of pseudo-terminals: the pty system and the ptmx system (links are to the kernel source used in 10.9.5).\nThey both ultimately offer the same functionality: they let one program (e.g. a terminal emulator) open (the master side of) a pseudo-terminal and subsequently start other programs (e.g. a shell) running “in” (the slave side of) that same pseudo-terminal.\nThe pty system is older. The device nodes for the master sides of its pseudo-terminals match the pattern /dev/pty[pqrstuvw][0123456789abcdef]. The slave sides use corresponding nodes named with tty (/dev/tty[pqrstuvw][0123456789abcdef]). These device nodes are allocated when the system starts (i.e. they are always present in /dev/).\nThe ptmx system is newer and uses a single master device node, /dev/ptmx, and uses /dev/ttys[0-9][0-9][0-9] for the slave sides. The slaves device nodes are dynamically allocated (so only the nodes that are still in use exist in /dev/).\nBasically, any program that uses the “modern” pseudo-terminal APIs will automatically end up using ptmx-based pseudo-terminals. Programs using the older pseduo-terminal interfaces will use pty-based pseudo-terminals.\n\nIn your case, when spawning its children, your sshd used the newer ptmx system (or an interface like openpty that uses it “under the hood”), but the pertinent ancestor of those root shells used the old pty system. If you are curious, you could trace the parent PIDs (PPID, the third column in your output) to find the ancestor program that spawned the line of processes that ended up running those root shells (the leading hyphen indicates that they are login shells).\nAlso, other systems may use variations on the device names. Some systems might go beyond 0–f for the pty names, and some systems use /dev/pts/<digits> (i.e. in a subdirectory instead of putting them all in /dev and having to use three digits to avoid conflict with the ttys0–ttys9 slave nodes from the pty system).\n", "Q: In Xcode, how can I utilize new UI APIs for Yosemite, but then revert to older ones for older OS'? I have been looking all over the place and can't seem to find an answer. (I'm probably not using the correct terminology) \nI'm building a simple AppleScript ObjC program and I want to use the new UI API for Yosemite (NSVisualEffectView) but, as expected, it crashes when I open it on Mavericks. How could I get it to use old APIs instead without having to create a completely different app?\n\nA: You'll need to figure out at runtime if method/class is available. Here's Apple guide about \"SDK Based Development\".\nIn Your case It'll look like this:\nif ([NSVisualEffectView class])\n{\n    // OS X 10.10 code here.\n}\nelse\n{\n    // OS X < 10.10 code here.\n}\n\n", "Q: coreaudiod and launchd are taking up 80% and 40% processor respectively I've just upgraded from mavericks to yosemite, the download was sluggish but eventually worked so I don't think any of the files were corrupted.

All I know is that when I woke up after leaving my MacBook Pro (15 inch, mid-2010) its fan was spinning out of control at the login screen.\nWhen I restarted and looked at the activity monitor I saw that core audio and launchd were the culprits.

I had previously unloaded a bunch of services.\nThe bluetooth issue was due to unloading the bluetooth service, but I had a bluetooth mouse plugged in via USB, I guess there was some override in the IO or something. \nLoading the service again fixed the issue.\n\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nThe core audio issue seems to have been fixed by loading the video assistant again\n\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.cmio.IIDCVideoAssistant.plist\n\nHope this helps someone as there shouldn't be the need for a full system restore because of one or two service issues.\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone using 4G data when in range of my WiFi? This month my data usage is very close to my plan limit, so I am trying to limit usage to prevent going over.  But every day I notice it is still creeping up, and when I look at the log my provider shows me of data used, I see lots of (mostly) little transfers at times when I know I was definitely in range of WiFi.  I am especially sure of the ones in middle of the night; these are something like 20-50kbytes of data, so I was wondering if I am missing a setting that lets the phone switch over the the (lower powered?) LTE after being asleep for a certain amount of time which I could switch off, or if there is some other reason that it isn't using the WiFi connection.  \n\nA: When the phone is asleep (also known as hibernation mode), the WiFi radio is shut off after a time to conserve battery power. Anything that occurs on the phone, such as receiving notifications, background app updates, et cetera, uses the cellular network instead of WiFi. The one notable exception would be iCloud backup, for which the phone wakes the WiFi radio.\n", "Q: Missing Push Notification Entitlement When submiting a app fro review I got the following message:\n\nMissing Push Notification Entitlement - Your app appears to include\n  API used to register with the Apple Push Notification service, but the\n  app signature's entitlements do not include the \"aps-environment\"\n  entitlement.

I'm not too sure if this is the right title but anyway... I have an old macbook early 2009 that I bought through my school and purchased the digital software as well- I have no disks and I don't know how to link anything to my name? Is that even possible if someone else set it up? So my old laptop has great programs to use on it but I now have a new 2014 macbook pro mid range and I would only like to transfer some of the applications, but from my research- correct me if I'm wrong, large applications like adobe acrobat pro have files throughout the computer and can't just be copied over. I don't want all the applications so a time machine transfer is out of the question. What can I do?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Generally speaking the Apple Migration Assistant will (optionally) transfer applications as well as documents. How well that works with any individual application will be up to the application vendor. And that info may be on their web site.\nSo it is theoretically possible to transfer settings, documents and applications from one Mac to another (ethernet, Firewire, Thunderbolt, etc...) though I don't believe you can choose exactly which Apps, Docs, Pics, etc. get transferred. So you may have to transfer everything and then delete the stuff you don't want/need.\nJust run the Apple Migration Assistant on the two computers that you have connected together and follow the prompts, it's real easy...\n", "Q: Handoff not working I am on Yosemite on Mac Air of mid 2011.\nBluetooth Low Energy Supported : Yes\nLMP version : 0x6\nThen why does Handoff not work ?\n\nA: System Requirements\nHandoff and Instant Hotspot\nHandoff and Instant Hotspot are supported by the following Mac models, and require OS X Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later)\n\n*iMac (Late 2012 and later)\n\n*Mac mini (Late 2012 and later)\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n\n\nHandoff is supported by the following iOS devices and requires iOS 8.

Every time, I am sending a new mail and running the script again, i get the same problem, the result just does not change. \n\nA: As one of the commenters alluded to, \"get first message of inbox\" probably won't return what you expect.\nWhen retrieving messages using AppleScript, Mail sorts your mailbox accounts alphabetically.  Within each account's inbox, messages are sorted newest first.  What you have selected in Mail doesn't change the order in which they're returned to AppleScript.\nSo if you have the following accounts and inbox messages appearing in Mail in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*My iCloud\n\n\n*\n\n*Message dated 1/5/16\n\n*Message dated 1/10/16\n\n\n*My Gmail\n\n\n*\n\n*Message dated 1/10/16\n\n*Message dated 1/5/16\n\n\n\n\"get first message of inbox\" will return the Message dated 1/5/16 from the \"My Gmail\" account (G comes before i, 1/5/16 comes before 1/10/16).\nMy guess is that you have more than one account in Mail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Name the specific mailbox.  This will always set theMessage to the newest message in \"My Gmail\".  (The account name is the same name you see in Mail in the list under Inbox).\nset theMessage to first message in mailbox \"INBOX\" of account \"My Gmail\"\n\nThis is an unusual approach, however, as mail moves, so the first message in your mailbox could become your second message unexpectedly.\nHere are a couple of reliable ways to extract data from messages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use selected messages (messages you've selected by clicking on them in Mail):\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theMessages to selection\n\n    -- This block extracts the topics from the messages\n    repeat with theMessage in theMessages\n        set theMessageText to content of theMessage\n        try\n            -- Set topic to the string starting just after the hash\n            set topic to rich text ((offset of \"#\" in theMessageText) + 1) thru end of theMessageText\n            -- Truncate the topic at the first space\n            set topic to rich text 1 thru ((offset of \" \" in topic) - 1) of topic\n        on error\n            -- No topic found in message\n            set topic to \"\"\n        end try\n        log topic\n\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\n*Mail Rules (run a script on messages that match certain criteria).

I am currently experiencing an issue with Terminal. I have enabled the option to open new tabs in the current working directory. However, this does not work as expected, when the path of the current working directory contains one or more umlauts. For instance, being in a directory Uni/Semester\\ 7/C++/Übung\\ 2 and hitting Cmd ⌘ + T to open a new tab places me in the directory I most recently cded to, e.g. Uni/Semester\\ 7/C++ or something. Same thing if I am in a subdirectory of Übung\\ 2.\nAnother symptom (at least they appear to be related) is that when quitting Terminal while in a directory containing umlauts, on reopening it will start in my home directory, not even in the closest parent without umlauts as in the new tab case.\nI've read that some people have troubles with Tab-autocompletion and umlauts. I do not, it works just fine, and I do not know if that is related.\nConfiguration-wise, I set the option Startup in Preferences > Settings > Shell to /opt/local/bin/bash -l (because the preinstalled bash version is outdated, removing this made no difference in behaviour). The option Shells open with in the preferences is set to default, I do not know if that is relevant.\nNow, the question: Does anyone know how to make Terminal work with umlauts such that I don't always have to renavigate to my working directory upon opening a new tab? It seems weird to me that I should be the first one to have that problem, I did not manage to google anything up.\nEDIT: I now upgraded to Yosemite. The problem persists. I cannot believe no one else has this problem. I also logged in as guest user to obtain default settings and the same thing happens.\n\nA: What ended up solving my problem is simply not using Terminal and switching to iTerm. It has everything Terminal has except the bugs and the latest update ironed out some annoyances with Yosemite. As of yet I have seen no reason to choose Terminal over iTerm.\n\nA: Prior to OS X El Capitan 10.11, the code in /etc/bashrc arranges to send an escape sequence at each prompt to tell Terminal what the current working directory is, but this code only percent-encodes spaces, which means that it doesn't work with characters that are not valid URL characters, which includes any non-ASCII characters like “Ü”:\nupdate_terminal_cwd() {\n    # Identify the directory using a \"file:\" scheme URL,\n    # including the host name to disambiguate local vs.\n    # remote connections. Percent-escape spaces.\n    local SEARCH=' '\n    local REPLACE='%20'\n    local PWD_URL=\"file://$HOSTNAME${PWD//$SEARCH/$REPLACE}\"\n    printf '\\e]7;%s\\a' \"$PWD_URL\"\n}\n\nOn 10.11 and later, the code has been moved to /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal and has been updated to percent-encode all characters that require it, so it can now work with characters like “Ü” (your example case works for me on 10.11.1):\nupdate_terminal_cwd() {\n    # Identify the directory using a \"file:\" scheme URL, including\n    # the host name to disambiguate local vs. remote paths.\n\n    # Percent-encode the pathname.\n    local url_path=''\n    {\n        # Use LC_CTYPE=C to process text byte-by-byte. Ensure that\n        # LC_ALL isn't set, so it doesn't interfere.\n        local i ch hexch LC_CTYPE=C LC_ALL=\n        for ((i = 0; i < ${#PWD}; ++i)); do\n            ch=\"${PWD:i:1}\"\n            if [[ \"$ch\" =~ [/._~A-Za-z0-9-] ]]; then\n                url_path+=\"$ch\"\n            else\n                printf -v hexch \"%02X\" \"'$ch\"\n                # printf treats values greater than 127 as\n                # negative and pads with \"FF\", so truncate.\n                url_path+=\"%${hexch: -2:2}\"\n            fi\n        done\n    }\n\n    printf '\\\\e]7;%s\\\\a' \"file://$HOSTNAME$url_path\"\n}\n\n[iTerm 2 apparently reads the working directory from the shell process state. This has the advantage that it works without any shell setup; however, it isn't guaranteed to be correct (there's no reason a shell's current working directory has to actually match the cwd it uses when executing a command, at any given moment), it doesn't work through indirect connections like ssh or shells running within editors or screen multiplexers, and it can't read the directory from processes owned by other users—for example, if you use sudo -s to create a root shell, it can't read the working directory from the root shell process. Furthermore, the program state only includes a file descriptor for the open directory, not the path that the shell is using for $PWD, so you won't actually get the path you used to navigate to the current directory in some cases—e.g., if you traversed through a symbolic link.]\n", "Q: How to upgrade firmware and reperform a Samsung 840 Evo on a Mac i got one of these Samsung 840 Evo Basic 500GB on an iMac (used externally in a TB case - standalone, not Fusion).\nI know there's a firmware update out which is already available for Mac users too but they only offer an iso image that only seems to work when used on a self burned CD. As i don't have an external CD for my iMac and not planning to have one i wonder what other way would be possible to update the firmware and probably use thise Performance restauration tool from Samsung that they offer for Windows.\nI've already tried booting into Bootcamp where this tool runs fine and also recognizes the SSD on the Thunderbolt port but it won't work as it only recognizes NTFS partitions and mine has HFS+ ofcourse.\nAny idea how to get that running? I'm on Yosemite with all machines, so rEFInd doesn't seem to be so easy to and i'm not sure if it would be a good idea to use it to get something like freedos running or whatever that Samsung tools need to get running.\nAny help?\nP.S: I've got problems with the SSD getting slow and have serious problems with a freezing finder where i hope the firmware update and the performance restauration help to get it running again. Just to give you a reason why i want to update the firmware.\n\nA: Adding to my answer as info trickles through on the interweb…  \n\nUpdate June 2015 - 1\nIt appears that no Mac made before 2012 can use this method, but I discovered yet another method using UNetbootin & a USB key - linked here\n I appreciate this is 'link only' but this answer is turning into a novel ;-)\n\nUpdate June 2015 - 2\nHowever, I today discovered that you can update the Firmware, though not reperform, by using a Windows PC & the latest Samsung Magician utility [as of today v4.6] without losing any data. It will update on a GUID/Mac Extended drive.\nThe drive must be attached internal SATA, it doesn't work in an external USB enclosure.\nMake sure you always fetch the latest Magician first, otherwise older versions claim the firmware is up to date, even if it is blatantly older than any other SSD in that machine!\nAs my old 2008 Mac Pro will have nothing to do with any of the CD/USB stick update methods, I thought that might be sufficient.  \nAs it turned out, I still needed to actually clone my boot partition, format to NTFS, reperform on Windows, then clone back - before I got back the drive's speed to as it was when new.\n\nA comment from Cindori [makers of TRIM Enabler] on why there is no 'easy way' on Mac…  \n\n\"The reason for Samsung not producing a OSX version of this tool is because they can't. \nApple does not expose the necessary driver stack for such disk interaction. It's the same thing stopping them from making Trim drivers or firmware upgrade utilities for OS X, and is why you have to use Boot CDs.\"\n\nTo run the Firmware updater, the SSD must be attached directly to an SATA port. It will not work over USB or PCIe, or on RAID or FileVault volumes.\nIt appears you may have to also remove all attached PCIe cards/devices except graphics cards before the SSD will be recognised by the tool.\nI hope it goes without saying that you need a full backup before attempting this.\nNeither Samsung's 'bootable' image nor FreeDOS have the necessary EFI boot loader so it's either a lot of typing in Terminal [Google translated from French original] for the brave, or one of the following methods…\nFor Macs with an internal DVD drive\n[Some USB DVD drives have been known to work too]\nGuide source - Conrad Chavez\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Samsung_Performance_Restoration.iso disk image from Samsung [DOS version for Mac users]\n\n*Rename the file to Samsung_Performance_Restoration.dmg\n\n*In Disk Utility, choose Images > Burn, select Samsung_Performance_Restoration.dmg and click Burn\n\n*Put a blank optical disc in the optical drive and finish burning the disc. When you’re done it should look like this:\n\n\n\nFor Macs without a DVD drive\nThe simplest method requires temporary access to Windows - either hardware or VM\nGuide Source - Pixelflush and Rufus\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Samsung_Performance_Restoration.iso disk image from Samsung [DOS version for Mac users]\n\n*Download Rufus\n\n*Use Rufus with default settings to copy the .iso to a USB stick.\n\n\nRunning the update\nTo use the bootable media, insert it and then restart the Mac while holding down the Option key. This displays the list of connected bootable volumes. Select the volume with the update on it (in my case the CD, the USB drive would show as a yellow USB icon titled Windows) and press Return. (You should also be able to boot directly into a CD or DVD by holding down the C key as the Mac starts up.)\nFrom this point on, the Samsung Performance Restoration utility takes over and works pretty much as it says in the Installation Guide. If you haven’t used DOS-based software, be aware that it’s all keyboard-based so forget about the trackpad or mouse, and pay attention for times when it asks you to do things like press the “y” (for Yes) key or press the Enter key.\nThe tool first installs a firmware update on the drive itself. When the tool says “Downloading Firmware…” I assume it means it’s downloading the firmware from the bootable media into the drive and not actually downloading over an Internet connection, but I’m not sure.\n\nWhen the firmware update is done, the software goes through a two-step process which includes recalibrating all the data on the drive. This can take a while and it depends on how big your SSD is. For my 1TB SSD, it took about two hours total. Do not interrupt the process. \n\nWhen it says “Samsung SSD 840 EVO Performance Restoration completed,” it’s safe to restart the Mac. At this point you can just hold down the Power button on your Mac until it turns off, (there appears to be no way to do a soft reboot from this point.) then press the Power button again to start back up.  If you want to eject the optical disc, hold down the mouse or trackpad button during restart and the Mac will pop out the disc before it even gets to the desktop.\nUpdate:\nI cannot get my own machine, Mac Pro 3,1 [Early 2008] to work by any of the above methods.\nNext will be to just back it up, drop it in a PC, do it there.\n\nA: I really doubt that the Update Software(Performance Restoration Software - ISO file)/Firmware file will help much. I don't think the necessary driver for the thunderbolt interface is included in the isolinux provided, at least i couldn't find any traces in the iso.  \nAdditionally Samsung advices to backup all your data on the SSD before updating the firmware or executing the performance restoration software.  \nPlease first check Samsung Performance Restoration Manual before updating the firmware and particularly General Limitations: 4) 13) 17)\nSo the easier way is to copy all data to another device, restarting into Windows7/8, reformatting the drive to NTFS and starting the Samsung Performance Restoration Software 1.1 there.\nAfterwards start Yosemite, reformat the drive to JHFS+ and refill the SSD with the previously copied data.\nPersonal comment: Samsung support is really an info desert at least for Mac users\n\nA: I updated my 840 EVO 500 GB internal drive that I had put on my 2013 Mac mini, running El Capitan, by downloading the EXT0DB6Q ISO file for Mac from Samsung's website.  I was at firmware EXT0BB6Q, and updated to EXT0DB6Q.\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn iso to CD (I used Titanium Toast).\n\n*Boot from that CD (hold down \"C\" while booting mac)\n\n*Install firmware and reboot.\n\n*Enable trim:  sudo trimforce enable\n\nA: If you have bootcamp installed, i would recommend running the Magician tool provided by Samsung there. Works like a charm and much more intuitive than working with the bootable usb drive or a bootable dvd method. The Magician software also checks if you need to do any additional things other than updating the firmware, so it could save you a lot of time.

However, the restored files don't ever appear in the file system after restoring. Once the animation is over and time machine closed, the files are nowhere to be found.\nI do not remember where in the file system the files used to be. Inside time machine it will only find the files as long as the search location is set to Devices > My MacBook Pro, but not on the HD. But in regular mode that entry dissapears from the sidebar and only shows the HD and the external back-up devices. \nTo me that seems like the files are restored on the computer but outside the harddrive - is that even possible??\nWhere could it be restoring the files to? Is it even restoring them?

The first byte of a MAC address needs to be even (e.g. end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E).\nSo, for example, 3b:92:22:cf:55:7e wouldn't work because '3b' is odd. See Wikipedia's MAC address article for the details (even = unicast, odd = multicast).\nTo avoid this problem, you can slightly edit your random-MAC sed command to force the second nibble to 0. \nopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//'\n\nCombining this with hrbrmstr's answer worked for me:\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport --disassociate\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether $(openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//')\nnetworksetup -detectnewhardware\n\n\nA: You need to disassociate the device before changing the MAC address.

The ZTE website at http://www.ztedevices.com/product/data_card/index_1.html shows several of their current products that might match what you have. If you can identify which product you have form the information on this site, or perhaps from your System Report (from the Apple menu select 'About this Mac' then click on System Report from the resulting window, then click on USB form the Hardware section, and you might get some useful information there avout your device - make sure of course that it is plugged in first) then you can go about making sure you have the latest software installed for the device. The same website provides software and documentation downloads. I've not checked whether their software downloads include support for Yosemite.\n\nA: My carrier confirms that ZTE has not released a driver update to support Yosemite.  Thi is terrible on ZTE's part because Apple provided developer information months in advance of their launch of 10.10.  It seems like we have to wait for ZTE to update their software, which you should be able to find in the connection manager when the USB stick is plugged in.\n\nA: I did try the above option. The ZTE Mf668 did start to connect and working but at very slow speeds. The web pages would hardly open. It seemed to operated at 2G speeds or lesser. The Light on the dongle which would earlier blink Blue colour was now blinking Green Colour. Blue light blinking  denotes high speed 3G connection which was now not happening even though I had selected GSM/3G as per above. Any Solution and Advise would be welcome. \nI wonder when would ZTE upload drivers for this MF668 Data dongle or all these data dongles would stop working globally on All the Macs upgraded to Yosimite OS 10.10\nNormally all hardware company's upgrade their drivers when any new major OS is released. I have written to ZTE help desk and customer support but they are of no help and are not aware of this problem quite surprisingly. \n\nA: I've been having the same problem with my ZTE MF821D. I've been in contact with ZTE for a couple of weeks and yesterday they sent me a Beta update package for Windows, this however updated the modem to work with Yosemite as well, so if you have a virtual desktop or a PC with windows at home, feel free to update the modem with this file\n\n\n*\n\n*https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31379385/DL_MF821D_TLN_SE_EUV1.00.04.exe%20(1).zip\nThis is a beta and I take no responsibility. ZTE have not yet released it. I asked them specifically if I could try it out and they sent me the file, I then without touching it, uploaded it to my own dropbox. It worked like a charm for me :)\n", "Q: Mac OS X Messages and Facetime Started Failing Couple of months ago sending messages and making FaceTime calls started to fail from my Mac. I never found the energy to look into this but after upgrading to Yosemite and still seeing the failures I gave up and spent some time on this.\nThey both started failing at the same time so I think they are somehow connected. I've gone through most of the solutions that the interwebs offer like resetting my timezone and cleaning up the ~/Library/Messages.\nToday I checked the message from console as what happens when I try to send a message or initiate a Facetime call.\nWhen I try a FaceTime call then it fails immediately and I see this in the log\nFaceTime(10788) deny mach-lookup com.apple.awdd\nThe full log is at https://gist.github.com/toomasr/1a92803e630f34eb4fb3\nAnd when I try to send a message I get a red exclamation mark immediately (in less than a second) and see the lines in the log\n21/10/14 14:40:35,703 imagent[240]: [Warning] Request to send message: IMMessageItem[outgoing: YES sender=(null); service=iMessage; handle=secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com; unformatted=(null); country=(null); roomName='(null)'; flags=100005; subject='<< Message Not Loggable >>' text='<< Message Not Loggable >>' messageID: 47 GUID:'F563CCF5-3A9C-4C89-9F8F-167D0131949E' date:'435584435.000000' date-delivered:'0.000000' date-read:'0.000000' date-played:'0.000000' transfer guids: '(null)' empty: NO finished: YES sent: NO read: NO delivered: NO audio: NO played: NO from-me: YES DD results: NO DD Scanned: YES Downgraded: NO emote: NO expirable: NO expire-state: 0 error: 0] to chat: IMDChat: 0x7fed82c76520 GUID: iMessage;-;secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com Style: - State: 3 Participants: (\n    \"[IMDHandle: <secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com:(null):(null)>]\"\n)  Room Name: (null)  Display Name: (null)  Identifier: secretEmailAddressThatIChanged@gmail.com  Unread count: 0  Row ID: 3  Group ID: 9B5305DB-4938-49A0-9129-F3313E82B731  from NIL ID  fromAccount: IDSAccount: 0x7fed82d216e0 [Service: com.apple.madrid  User: myEmailAddress@gmail.com  ID: B7B7962F-E5DE-4991-BB89-F4498794132A  Type: Apple ID  Active: YES  Registration Status: Registered]\n\nNot sure how to move on with this.

I have just updated to Yosemite and something must have changed in the way Preview renders fonts. \nI find that Preview display of text in PDF files is rather sloppy, I am pretty sure it used to be much sharper in Mavericks. At the very least now Preview is significantly less sharp than Acrobat Reader, you can check out a screen-shot to convince yourself of what I am talking about.\nIn the rest of the UI I am quite happy with how fonts are displayed. So I was wondering if there are ways to control the anti-aliasing of Preview. In the preferences of Preview I can find only a global switch for anti-aliasing, but I would like to play around with the strength of the anti-aliasing so to find the optimal setting. \nI am looking into defaults of com.apple.Preview but in my current values there seem to be no setting about Font Smoothing or anything evocative of anti-aliasing. Any suggestion about possible values to edit here?\nThanks for your suggestions,\nRoberto\n\n\nA: Apparently in Yosemite, Preview doesn't use LCD font smoothing (subpixel rendering) even if LCD font smoothing is enabled from System Preferences. Skim never uses LCD font smoothing either, but the way text is rendered depends on the AppleFontSmoothing setting or whether LCD font smoothing is enabled from System Preferences.\n\nCommands like defaults write -app Preview AppleFontSmoothing -int 2 don't have any effect. I didn't find any preference keys by running strings /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview or strings /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/PDFKit.framework/PDFKit either.\nSkim's developer closed a bug about the issue as \"can't fix\".\n\nA: Gustavo's Answer fixes the problem on El Capitan 10.11.4 as well.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n\nA: Finally the Problem has been fixed by Apple. You just have to update to Yosemite 10.10.3!\n\nA: I have found a solution to this problem: replacing Yosemite's PDFKit with Mavericks' PDFKit. As simple as that. I replaced the contents of /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/PDFKit.framework/Versions/A and everything is working fine now.\nFor those who don't have a copy of Mavericks from where you can take the PDFKit files, I have uploaded a copy to: http://www.filedropper.com/pdfkit (hope there are no copyright issues with this - I will remove the link if asked to do so).\nBy the way, changing the Current symlink to point to the Mavericks version and keeping the original A/ directory DIDN'T fix the issue. I had to remove the Yosemite version completely and put the Mavericks version contents inside A/ (it seems Preview and Skim both are hard coded to Versions/A and do not follow the Current symlink).\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the from address on Mac OS X server email alerts? I have enabled email notifications in Server.app (2.2.4) on Mac OS X server (10.8.5)\nIf port 25 is not being blocked at the local firewall or the ISP, this generally works ok.\nI've found that if it is being blocked by the ISP, you can go the mail settings within server.app, and set mail to route all mail traffic through ISP and specify your ISP's SMTP gateway, even if you don't actually have the mail server enabled and/or use the mail server.\nThe problem that I've run into is that I have a client who uses an email hosting provider that requires a valid MX record for the domain that an email is coming from.\nTheir admin@companyname.com where they want to receive their Mac OS X server alerts cannot receive the alerts because the messages are seen as coming from an invalid domain with no MX record.\nThe Mac OS X server is called macminiserver01.local or macminiserver01.private and when the email alerts are sent out from server.app, the from address becomes root@macminiserver01.local or root@macminiserver01.private.\nIs there a way to manually change the from address so that it is valid?\n\nA: I know this question is a few years old, but I had the same issue some up today. I resolved it with help from this post:\nhttps://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-postfix-masquerade-change-email-mail-address.html\nThis was on a Mac server that did not have mail enabled. Apparently even with postfix disabled, the alerts function fires it up just long enough to send the alert email and then closes it again. Running nettop while sending the test alert email lets you see sendmail kick off, followed by postdrop, master, pickup and qmgr. \nI found five different locations for the main.cf file file, but the one that seemed to be active was located in:\n/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix\nEdit that file to append this line:\nsmtp_generic_maps = hash:/Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/generic\nThen edit generic by appending the mapping you want:\nalerts@server.local alerts@validdomain.com\nThen run:\npostmap /Library/Server/Mail/Config/postfix/generic\n", "Q: Where are my old (previous) iCloud files after upgrading to OS X 10.10 Yosemite? I previously had about 200 .txt files saved in iCloud via TextEdit.\nAfter installing the Yosemite (10.10), there is now a folder hierarchy in iCloud, and all my previous files seem to have disappeared.\nI have looked in /Library/Mobile Documents -- they're not there.\nI have tried showing hidden files and looking through the Library with no success.\nupdate - I have several Time Machine backups made well before I updated to Yosemite, but there are no documents in /Users/(username)/Library/Mobile Documents/(textedit folder)\n\nA: The files are still there, just no longer accessible via Finder.\nYou can use ls ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/ to verify. To note, the folder has always been treated specially, and instead of just the App names, you'll see some unique strings followed by the app name.\nFor a paid solution, Path Finder by Cocoatech still displays all the files, helpfully removing the extra strings as Finder used to, while also directly jumping to the Documents section. It works pretty well, but Path Finder is expensive for its relatively unimpressive set of features, and the developers try to milk it each year.\nFor a free solution, Plain Cloud works, although its UI is pretty rough and bare bones, and the app itself is quasi-abandoned. (Currently there is a rendering error that causes the first app to be partially obscured, but using the reload button fixes this.)\nHope this helps.\nPS. More directly to your question, if the files were truly stored in TextEdit's iCloud you should be able to access the files under TextEdit > Open > under iCloud Library choose TextEdit - iCloud.\n\nA: I just found this out the hard way resetting cloud clipboard.

My first is to try creating a folder called .Trashes elsewhere and moving it such that it would overwrite the original folder; it's possible that this would leapfrog the problem (I used a similar method to fix a problem I was having a few months ago).\nAlternatively, if the external drive is FAT32, have you tried booting a Linux distro from a USB drive and using that? Alternatively you could plug the external drive into a Windows machine (Boot Camp/VirtualBox?) and see whether that can delete the offending folder.\n\nA: Have you tried rm as root:\nsudo rm -r Filename_with*\n\nThat command will ask for your administrator password.\n\nA: I had this issue and the only solution that worked for me was to format the external HDD the files were originally on.

I am using OS X 10.10 with iCloud Drive. I am thinking of upgrading to a bigger storage plan (at the moment: 5GB). \nI am running this Version on a MacBook Air with 128GB. \n\nIf I buy the 500GB package, does it mean that I fill up my local hard\n  drive automatically when I upload things to the iCloud Drive?\n\niTunes has the Option of stream the music i didn't download yet. \nHow does iCloud Drive behave? Is there any Online Document?\n\nA: Yes, iCloud drive on Macs keeps all of the files locally on every Mac, and needs enough space to do so. There's (at present) no selective sync option to keep some folders or files off some Macs.\nIf you have more files in the cloud than space on your devices, you will not have all the files stored locally.\nWindows is designed similarly and there isn't a specific article by Apple to document how iCloud is designed. The general page says your files exist everywhere and glosses over the reality that when you initially add files, there's a delay in uploading and checking the files in.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/\nOn the Mac you can use brctl log -w to inspect the internal status of sync, but be aware there are lots of \"errors\" and \"warnings\" that don't impact the actual results of an account with all files synced.\n\nA: You can disable/uninstall icloud drive on your mac/windows and use only the web-interface (icloud.com) to upload & manage your files.\n\nA: I have many Pages files and it took a good half hour to download them all to Pages on my iPhone and then Pages there became sluggish, so I turned iCloud for Pages off again.

It just shows a black screen when I open it, and when I hold down the power button, it just goes back to sleep. Then when I wake it, it shows a black screen again, repeat step 1.\nHow can I use my computer again??\n\nA: Regardless of the state of the Mac, holding down the power button will always kill it and allow you to cold boot.

But there is no such thing here in Yosemite anymore.\n\nA: Preferences -> Spotlight -> Search Results allows you to change the order of results by reordering categories.

I have a certain program that doesn't work right unless I run it as sudo.

If you create a script that runs as sudo and click it, it just fails due to permissions.

Do I need an internet connection on my iPhone 6 to use Apple Pay?\n\nA: No, Apple Pay does not require an internet connection.  Apple Pay uses NFC technology; it does not use Wi-Fi or cellular technology.\nAccording to CNet, Apple Pay will work even if you put your iPhone 6 into Airplane Mode.  Airplane Mode disables both the Wi-Fi and cellular internet.\n\nA: The answer is yes and no.\nInternet connectivity is required for any setup or maintenance of your cards.  Once a card has been successfully added to the device, the phone can be disconnected for payments, which is a local interaction between the device and the point of sale terminal.\n\nA: No, Apple Pay can be used an unlimited number of times while offline since it generates payment information locally as opposed to some other mobile payments like HCE which only allow a limited number of payments in-between getting an internet connection.\nApple Support article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201469\n", "Q: Prevent redraw of menu bar icons Yosemite When switching between two screens, all the icons in the menu bar appear to be re-drawn, causing an annoying jittery effect. This started happening after upgrading to Yosemite.\nIs there any documentation available on this problem? Are others experiencing the same issue? Is there a fix available?\nI currently have in my menu bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Twitter\n\n*Dropbox\n\n*Grabbox\n\n*F.lux\n\n*Caffeine\n\n*Time Machine\n\n*Menu Meters\n\n*WiFi\n\n*Sound\n\n*Battery (incl. percentage)\n\n*Time (digital)\n\n*Account switcher\n\n*Spotlight\n\n*Notification Center\n\n\nThough I doubt any one of them is the cause.\n\nA: Update 2015-03-04: According to some updated release notes from the Bartender app (v1.2.32; emphasis mine):\n\nApple appear to have fixed the flickering item issue for multiple\n  monitors in Yosemite with 10.10.3 Beta 2; but in doing so Bartender\n  stopped working correctly. We have made changes to Bartender for\n  10.10.3 Beta 2 and anticipate it to now be working smoothly; if you see any issues with Bartender please do let us know. \n\nSo there may be an end to this problem in sight.\n\nI'm sorry to say that, according to my own email exchange with their Advisors, Apple Engineering's official response is that this is by design:\n\nThis is normal behavior caused by transparency being turned off and on to differentiate between which display is active. \nThere are a few workarounds you can try. \n— Adjust the settings in System Preferences —> Accessibility and enable reduce transparency.\n— Disable displays have separate spaces. \n— Enable Use Dark Menu Bar and Dock in System Preferences —> General.\n\nAnother Workaround with Bartender\nIn my experience, I also run Bartender to limit the number of active status bar icons. Since fewer icons have to redraw, it decreases the redraw delay when switching monitors. They still redraw, and it's still annoying, but the increased UI responsiveness helps me ignore it.\nTroubleshooting Steps that Do Nothing\nI performed the following steps with a Senior Apple Technical Advisor and Engineer during a support case for this same issue. None of these fixed the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*creating a new user (and thus a blank user profile)\n\n*going into safe mode (including with a new user account)\n\n*reinstalling the OS\n\n*resetting SMC and NVRAM\n\n*running Apple Hardware Test\n\n*running VGA dongle diagnostic tools\n\n\nDetailed Problem Description\nVideos of the behavior are posted here: https://flic.kr/s/aHsk5xxSb1\n\n\n*\n\n*When either one or two external monitors is attached,\n\n*\n\n*via HDMI, MiniDP>DP, or MiniDP>VGA\n\n\n*regardless of whether the lid is open or closed,\n\n*and Displays have separate Spaces is enabled,\n\n*one can click the desktop on any inactive desktop (the desktop with a grayed-out or muted menubar),\n\n*and that display's menubar's icons will begin redrawing,\n\n*\n\n*which manifests as a jittering of icons (expressed as a shifting laterally and vertically),\n\n*a rearranging of icons (in the case where one has rearranged them manually by holding down the CMD key and dragging them),\n\n*and a brief de-antialiasing followed by a re-antialiasing (or dithering) of the icons.\n\n\n*This occurs with all icons in the right-hand side of the menubar,\n\n*\n\n*but not those on the left (apple, and menu items),\n\n*and also excluding the sidebar icon.\n\n\n*The symptoms do not occur when transitioning from one external monitor to another.\n\n*The shifting of icons causes a functional delay between initiating the transition and using the application in the destination screen. (In my case, 3-5 seconds.)\n\n*\n\n*The delay's timing appears related to the number of status bar icons you have.\n\n\n\nRoot Cause?\nI expect that this is a software issue related to SystemUIServer or one of the underlying (private) UI libraries. It seems heavily related to antialiasing. Although Apple says this is expected behavior, I think many users would agree this is a bug introduced with Yosemite.\n\nA: My menu bar has stopped blinking for real, my previous answer did not work. The fix? Simply restart your Mac into Safe Boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Hold down shift after the restart sound plays\n\n*Log in\n\n*restart the computer and no more flashing. \n\n\nThat simple.\n\nA: Apple seem to be well aware of this now. I filed a bug report on bugreport.apple.com and it was marked as a duplicate:\nDuplicate of 17643875 (Open)\nGiven it's still open, hopefully we'll see a fix in some revision of Yosemite.\nOtherwise, System Preferences —> Accessibility -> Displays have separate spaces (logout/login) by itself does the trick for me - but no menu bar on the second screen.\n\nA: I have the same issue. In Accessibility settings, turn on \"Reduce Transparency\". That mitigates the issue somewhat, however I still see a bit of lag with the newly selected window on the other monitor being fully focused.\n\nA: I removed iStat Menus from the menu bar, there is no update but it stopped the constant jittery or redrawing quirk. \nThis software, that I liked using, seemed to be causing the issue. The redrawing or jittery effect on the menu icons seemed to also cause a constant slow down in the finder response as well.\nMy menu icons are stable now. I tried making the various changes such as resetting the SMC, the PRAM as well as removing transparency and going dark but nothing stopped the annoying behavior.\nFor me I quit Fantastical but then started going through the menu items and iStat menu was next inline. It just didn't play nice with Yosemite. I suggest removing menu items to find the one causing the jittery or redrawing of menu bar icons to stop this quirk in Yosemite.\nI went from Lion to Yosemite.\nI have no experience with other operating systems in-between.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade from iOS 8.0.2 to iOS 8.1 I have an iPad 2 and it currently has iOS 8.0.2, it says to install iOS 8.1 but when I click on update it brings up the agree or disagree the terms page as normal, and I click on agree and nothing happens, it just freezes and then times out!\nWhat can I do about this?\n\nA: Just fixed this by making sure I was signed into iTunes, then agreeing to updated iTunes terms and conditions, then hard-resetting.

If it hasn't been used in several hours, will it be asleep such that it will not register \"online\" even if close enough to WiFi?\n\nA: It means that the Find My iPhone service cannot contact the iPod. This could be because it's turned off, or because it's out of range of a known Wi-Fi router. If it's asleep, it will still register on Find My iPhone, so it's either run out of battery or not able to get onto Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: I Pay for iTunes Match So Why Does iTunes Radio Now Have Ads (iTunes 12.0.1.26) I pay for iTunes Match, account is in good standing, auto-renew is turned on.\nI just update to iTunes 12.0.1.26 now I have ads when using iTunes radio.  How do I get rid of them?  I've already tried these recommendations.\nUPDATE: I went to Store -> Update iTunes Match, after it updated I skipped through the max (6 songs) on 4 different stations (24 total songs) and have not seen an ad yet.  Maybe that did the trick.  I was skipping through them though, not listening to them.\n\nA: I have the same problem, and found something that worked.

In the \"To:\" box in the Messages app on OS X, when I start typing in a contact name, I get old \"iMessage\" contacts which I've long since deleted. They certainly don't exist in my contacts; the only place I think they could exist is in my iMessage History somewhere on the iCloud servers. In any case, how can I delete them? Thanks.\n\nA: The answer provided by @Noldorin works for me: \n\nMessages on OS X doesn't allow \"Recent\" contacts to be deleted, but\n  Messages on iOS does allow this. An oversight by Apple, but this is a\n  fix nonetheless.\n\nTo clarify, I looked at recent addresses on my iPhone/iMessage when starting a new conversation. There's an \"i\" symbol which allows your to see recent group conversations and addresses, and also a remove button.\nOnce removed the erroneous address is no longer visible in OS X iMessage.\n\nA: Just found the solution myself: Messages on OS X doesn't allow \"Recent\" contacts to be deleted, but Messages on iOS does allow this. An oversight by Apple, but this is a fix nonetheless.\n\nA: You need to remove the person in iMessage on iOS device (when typing the name of the person that should not be in your contacts anymore, that person's name may still appear. press the little \"i\" icon on the right and choose \"remove from recent\"), Quit and reopen imessage on OS X, when you start typing that name it will no longer show.

My thoughts are, \"if it ain't fixed, don't broke it\".  I am mostly concerned with updating for security, but dont wany any system conflicts.\n\nA: Apple doesn't support its OSes as long as Microsoft supported XP. \nWise advice would be possibly \"Don't jump right now, but don't leave it too long\"\nIt's always wise to wait until applications are updated to support a new OS & initial bugs are ironed out, so waiting for 10.10.1 would be a sensible precaution, but you don't really want to hold off until it's so out of date that if you upgrade nothing you currently own will run.\n\nA: Some key areas to consider also play into the functionality you wish to utilize across Apple platforms.\nOS X 10.10 (Yosemite) implements iCloud Drive which will allow you to share files and resources with your iOS 8 devices and other OS X 10.10 devices.  This functionality alone may be worth the free upgrade alone for some users.\nIt also implements a new function called Handoff which lets you complete work you may have started on another device.\nMessages integrates with your iPhone now as well and allows you to send SMS via your OS X device.\nHere is an overview of what's new in 10.10: http://help.apple.com/osx-yosemite/whats-new/\nA lot to consider when coming from 10.8.\n\nA: If you want to stay with 10.8 i would at least recommend to update to 10.8.5 with the Combo Installer and install subsequently the Security Update 2014-005 Mountain Lion which both address bug fixes and security flaws.  \nThe same applies for all Apple app updates (Safari, iTunes etc) which are handled by the App Store.app.\n", "Q: Terminal command to move a number of files containing brackets to another folder or trash Last night I consolidated a music collection into one place and each song is separated by an Artist folder and the track. The problem is that there are a high number of duplicates within these folders. There are over 3,000 artist folders and in each artist folder there are a couple of duplicates, so I wouldn't like to guess how many duplicates there are in total. \nThe software I used to consolidate the music has taken each duplicate track and renamed the subsequent file with an (1).mp3, or if it has more than one duplicate, it has been renamed (2).mp3, (3).mp3 and so on until it renames the last number of duplicates found for that particular track.\nSo i felt the best way to delete these was to do a simple \"(1).mp3\" search in spotlight but for some reason it does not give me the right results no matter what I try. (I read somewhere it has something to do with how linux/mac os is setup). So I then looked into using terminal to search the directory using the appropriate command. But this does not seem to work either. The path of the directory is:\n\n/Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Music\\ Database\n\nSo I used the command…\nfind /Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Music\\ Database “(1).mp3\"\n\n…which does return results, but not in the way I expected, i.e. it returns many files, only some of which have the (1).mp3 at the end of them. Most of them don't have this and are just normal tracks with .mp3 at the end. e.g. The Beatles - Ticket to Ride.mp3\nSo I then looked into a command that would allow me to search for these files and move the results into another location. So I created a folder called \"Moved Files\" which has a directory of:\n\n/Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Moved\\ Files\n\nSo I used the following command I found online...\nfind /Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Music\\ Database “(1).mp3\" -exec mv {} ~/Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Moved\\ Files \\;\n\n…which does one of two things depending on what humour Terminal is in. It either moves the wrong files to the specified directory (maybe due to the inaccurate search results I had at the beginning) or it gives me the following error:\n\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'\n\nIf anyone out there can help me I would really appreciate it. It's really frustrating to know that if this was a windows machine, all I would need to do is type *(1).mp3 in the search bar and block delete all of the results, but I honestly cannot find a way around this on a mac. And \"NO\" I cannot use a windows machine as it is an apple G Drive that has all the audio stored on it.\n\nA: Simply use Spotlight in Finder to search for files with *(1).mp3 etc. Begin a new Spotlight search, add a Raw Query rule and use the following, then select all and delete.\nkMDItemDisplayName=='*(1).mp3'\n\n\nA: find expects a pattern not just a name, so you might get better results with\nfind /Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Music\\ Database -name '*(1).mp3' -print\n\n\nA: Seems that the error in you terminal command is due to a bad cut and paste. Replace the first “ with \" , so that the final command is the following:\nfind /Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Music\\ Database -name \"*(1).mp3\" -exec mv {} ~/Volumes/AUDIO\\ DRIVE/Moved\\ Files \\;\n\nIf you are confident with the terminal I suggest to install fdupes or the fork fdupes-jody and then:\nfdupes -r dir1 dir2 | grep dir1/ | xargs rm \n\nto removes duplicates in dir1.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Determine if file or directory is encrypted?

At restart, if I just open the application that is saved on desktop 4, will applications 2 and 3 restart automatically?\n\nA: \nIs it better to just close the lid on a macbook pro or should I shut it down?\n\nThat depends on you; many computer users almost never shut down their computers. It's fine to put it to sleep if you know you are going use the computer again soon. Sometimes though, it's best to shut it down if you're not going to use it for a day or two, as it will save a little bit of energy and heat from being wasted in your laptop. Also, shutting down completely wipes away the computer's RAM, which might have some corrupt/junk data left in it from various things the computer does. It also lets the computer's components cool down. I definitely recommend you shutting down at least once a month or so.\n\nWhen I restart a computer, and I have multiple desktops open, will the desktops all restart with settings saved to reopen applications on those same desktops?\n\nFrom Os X 10.8 and later, yes they will, all your desktops will survive reboots and all the applications will \"remember\" in which desktop they were open. Though, when you hit 'restart' you will be prompted a message to confirm, and there will be this option: Reopen windows when loging back in, make sure it's checked.\n\nIf I have an application open on desktop 4 and options --> this desktop so that the application only opens on desktop 4, will desktops 2 and 3 automatically open if I did not have them open at restart? \n\nNo, they won't. As I said earlier, if you have desktop 1-2-3-4 open and then you restart the system, they will reappear then. If you close a desktop, for example 2, desktop 3 will become desktop 2 and desktop 4 will become desktop 3. \nSo if you have only two desktops open and you open the app that was saved to work on desktop 4, former desktop 2 and 3 won't appear, the app will just bind on the new desktop where you open it. \n\nAt restart, if I just open the application that is saved on desktop 4, will applications 2 and 3 restart automatically?\n\nAs stated above, they won't.\n", "Q: Driving a 4K display at 60Hz with rMBP I've been Googling so much my eyes hurt.\nI have a 2014 rMBP.\nI want to use it with a 4K display or UHD TV at 60Hz that's at least 30\" big.\nFrom my research, this means either using something with a DisplayPort input, or with HDMI 2.0.\nThe MBP only has HDMI 1.4 (I think) and is thus limited to 30Hz.\nThere are no >28\" 4K monitors for less than $3,000.\nBut what if I used one of these DP-to-HDMI2 adapters? Would that make it possible to use a UHD TV with HDMI2 like this one?\nHas anyone tried this kind of set up? Are there any decent 4K TVs/monitors for less than $1,500?\n\nA: Your question has two parts: whether an rMBP can drive a 4K display, and whether any exist within your price range.\nApple's support site lists compatibility between their laptops and 4K displays.\nIf your Retina Macbook Pro is one of the 15\" models, it can drive 60Hz MST displays at 60Hz through the thunderbolt port.\nIf it is a 13\" model, it cannot - you are limited to 30hz regardless of output.\nIf your laptop does support it, the Asus PQ321Q is a 32\" monitor that accepts a 60Hz image via MST. It is $2000.\nThere are also numerous 28\" models that support 60Hz over DisplayPort 1.2. One example would be the $500 Samsung U28D590D.\n\nA: stumbled across this question 5 months later, but here are my findings after my own googling as of april 2015:\nYou cant run a 4k TV with only HDMI inputs at 60hz from any Mac. I recently purchased the exact TV you linked, the 40\" samsung UHD. It only has HDMI inputs, and my rocketfish DP to HDMI adapter cable going from my mid-2014 rMBP with OSX 10.10.3 does not work at 4K at all. According to my googling none of the DP-to-HDMI cables output HDMI 2.0. ALthough there may be some coming to market in the next few months (from accell/bizlink).\nGoing from the HDMI 1.4 output on my rMBP I can get 4k, but only at 30hz.\nAlso, a samsung online chat rep informed me that none of their TV's have displayport inputs. Only their 28\" and 32\" computer monitors.\nSo, regretfully, I'm about to return my beautiful 40\" TV to bestbuy and get a smaller 28\" monitor with DisplayPort input. The world isnt quite ready for running OSX on a 40\" TV at 60hz.\n", "Q: iOS app for decorating Virtual Reality rooms I'm looking for a simple (or complex) iOS app that will allow me to put some pictures in virtual \"rooms\" (like an art gallery) that can then be viewed on the web or smartphones. That's all.\nI think one of the many interior home decoration apps might do the trick but I don't know which is the simplest for my very narrow use case. I don't care about creating or placing any 3D models. I only want to hang some virtual paintings on some virtual walls and let other people virtually walk through them.\n\nA: Your best bet is Aurasma. It is a simple yet powerful augmented reality platform, and will do what you need and more. Should you want to add videos and 3D 'realities' to the virtual space, you can do it with ease.

My recent upgrade to Yosemite (from Mavericks) took about 6 hours, nearly all of which time was used in processing the contents of /usr/local (e.g. TeX, etc.).\nWhat is the upgrade process doing with these files that takes so long? Could I accelerate future updates by simply backing up these files, clearing the directory, and copying them manually after the update, or is the update process doing something critical with them?\n\nA: The problem is only accute if you have a lot of files in /usr/local -- a few hundred files is not a problem. It needs to be many thousands of files. The reason, according to this post, is:\n\nPart of the upgrade involves moving /usr/local out of the way. The process of moving those files back after the upgrade is done one file at a time and seems very slow.\n\nHe goes on to recommend removing anything from your Homebrew installs that isn't currently necessary with the brew remove; brew cleanup command pair. You can also move it aside, temporarily, naming it something like /usr/local.mine and then move it back after the update -- though this can make working with your Mac slightly problematic if you've, for example, switched your default shell for your account to be the Homebrew-supplied zsh or something like that.\nPersonally I opted to clean up my Homebrew installs. I also removed any Homebrew-installed daemons (MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis) completely and shut them down. They're easy enough to get back after the installation is complete. In the end I had only a handful of Homebrew packages installed still that were very essential to me and the installation time wasn't too bad -- about 2 hours on an old iMac.\nOf course, you can also wipe everything and just start again. First save everything you have installed:\nbrew list | sed s/\\s+/\\\\n/g | tee my-brew-packages.txt\n\nAnd now remove them all with:\ncat ~/my-brew-packages.txt | xargs brew remove --force\nbrew cleanup --force\n\nAnd to re-install things after you've updated:\ncat ~/my-brew-packages.txt | xargs brew install\n\n", "Q: SmoothDraw Alternative to Make Videos like Khan Academy I want to make educational videos like Khan Academy on my Mac. I am looking for a good app that works just like SmoothDraw -- which is what Khan Academy uses. I have found apps that let me draw on the screen using a tablet, however I have not found one that lets me scroll the \"whiteboard\" down in the way SmoothDraw does.\nWhat app would you recommend as the equivalent of SmoothDraw for the Mac?\n\nA: Try Krita. It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It's designed more for painting, but it should work just fine for this.\nI believe it works with tablets, although I'm not 100% sure. It doesn't have an infinite canvas (if you even need that), but you can always start with a canvas bigger than the screen and use it like a whiteboard. Middle-clicking-and-holding will scroll the canvas. (If you don't have a three-button mouse, hold Space and drag. Two-finger scrolling will not work.)\nPlus, it's free and open source!\n\nIf you do need an infinite canvas, try Inkscape. Unlike Krita, it uses vectors, so you can zoom in and out without worrying about quality. I don't think it supports graphics tablets, though.\nIf you go this route, when you launch Inkscape it will ask you to install X11. Be aware that it won't work quite like other Mac apps—it's running in its own windowing system. One main difference is that Ctrl will work as an alternate Cmd key.\n\nA: Microsoft OneNote works well for me as a more complex software. Optimized for touch also for an easy use with a stylus.\n", "Q: Is my password vulnerable to recovery using my Apple ID? For some time, in Mavericks, I had an option, which I had disabled, in Users & Groups > Password to reset the password using Apple ID\n\nThis option vanished after a migration, under Mavericks, to a new machine\n\nand remains absent after an update to Yosemite\n\nSo I can't tell: Can a I reset my password using my Apple ID or not? \n\nI had explicitly disabled this earlier for security reasons, but now I can't tell whether it has been enabled or not (or how I'd change it if I wanted to).\n\nA: Here is what is going on with missing reset password with Apple ID.\n\nFileVault 2-enabled Macs will not show a \"Allow user to reset password\n  using Apple ID\"\n\nHow to in FileVault is described here.\nSince you are NOT using the Apple ID password recovery feature (it is not enabled) your FileVault password is NOT vulnerable to it.

I'm trying to writing an applescript that cycles through Songs, Albums, Artists, Composers, Genres, and back to Songs. \n\nThere is nothing in applescript Dictionary with regards to this, so I have to resort to UIscripting/Accessibility. This is what I have so far:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"iTunes\"\n\n    set frontmost to true -- necessary\n    delay 1 -- for last line to take effect, delete if you bind this to keyboard shortcut\n\n    tell window 1 -- tell window \"iTunes\" only works when in fullscreen\n\n        tell pop up button 2 to perform action \"AXPress\" -- equivalent of\n        --keystroke \"j\" using {command down}\n\n        tell UI element 1 of row 5 of table 1 of pop over 1 of pop up button 2 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n        -- pressing Genres button, assuming Vies is not in Genres already, of course\n\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nYou can run this with Script Editor, or preferably for the purpose of the rest of this question, bind it to a keyboard shortcut and invoke it while in iTunes.

Nope, you are just moving through library items in the background, all the while the menu is still in display in the foreground.\nSo, my question boils down to, how can I move cursor focus to this pop up menu?\nUPDATE: Thanks @jackjr300 for the answer.

While in Gmail, on the top right corner I can see my Google (g+) profile image, but when I hit reply button to reply to an email, then instead of my Google image, it's the default icon that came with my Macbook Admin account (a hawk) being used.\nHere is a screenshot of the issue:\n\nThis is really, really annoying and looks totally unprofessional, which makes me wondering about Apple products. I have deleted my Gmail account from the Apple's Mail app and I have also disable it from the Messages app, but still Apple's image persists.\nSo, how can I get rid of Apple's image appearing on Gmail? Does anybody know how those two are being connected?\nNOTE: Just to note that I've used my Gmail email address to register to Apple.\n\nA: Apple did not change your Gmail profile picture. What is (likely) actually happening is the following:\nWhen you add a Gmail account to Mail.app, you can choose to sync contacts with Google. (It might even do it by default. I am not sure because it has been years since I set it up.) If you do so, all of the contacts in Contacts (Address Book) on your Mac will be sent to Google, including the contact that represents you. If you did not set up a specific contact for yourself in Mac Contacts, Apple did so and for that contact, the picture would have been the one used for your Mac user account.\nWhen the contacts synced to Google, the one with your name, email and the hawk picture was sent along with it. Google reads your contacts and displays the icon from your contacts, NOT your Gmail/Google+ profile picture, next to the Reply/Forward box.\nTo test this, confirm you have a contact in your Gmail account that has your email address in it, and that it has that picture. Delete that contact and the picture next to the Reply/Forward box should return to normal. You can prevent this going forward by changing the picture for your entry in Contacts on your Mac.\n\nA: I had this happen when I set up Messages with my Google account on a new Mac, without using Apple Mail or Contacts; suddenly Gmail was the stock image the Mac had defaulted to.\nThe fix was to log into Gmail via the browser, go into its settings:\n\n-- the gear menu, not the Google Account menu (which was still showing my usual Google profile picture), where I found the offending image in the My Picture section, and was able to change it.\n\n\nA: You are probably syncing Google contacts to the Contacts app in OS X. If this is the case, you can edit the image by finding your contact card in the Contacts app and clicking the image to choose a new one. This change should then sync to your Google account.\nIf you want to turn contact syncing off for your Google account, you can do so in System Preferences > Internet Accounts.\n\nA: I have the same problem and eventually managed to resolve it. Have to say that this is exceptionally annoying.\nI ultimately fixed this by updating the Mac contact for myself. Because I couldn't simply upload a picture (more detail below), I did this by copying the picture to the \\Library\\User pictures\\Fun folder, then editing the contact in the Contacts app (where my picture was now available to select under \"Default\").\nThat's the solution, now for my rant (and hopefully at least some useful background info):\nFirstly, the image does not come from the gmail contact, it comes from the gmail \"My picture\" setting. If you go into settings in gmail the incorrect picture is shown there as well. It might well originate from the Mac contact, but in gmail it does NOT come from the contact, so updating the contact in gmail will not change it.\nSecondly, switching off contact sync to solve this is really not a solution. If you have hundreds of contacts that you would like to keep in sync then it doesn't make sense to switch it off just because Apple has introduced some rogue behaviour that updates a gmail setting from one contact instead of just syncing the contacts like it was supposed to.\nThirdly, when I do go to my own contact in Gmail, the image is not the incorrect Apple one, it's my image that I want to use. So it seems that the contact sync, instead of syncing the contact image to the contact (which would make some sense) actually does not do that and instead it updates the Gmail picture setting. I'm not 100% sure it is the contact sync that's to blame though. From various google forums posts a lot of users reported similar behaviour with chat clients (esp. Pidgin) updating the gmail pic, so I suspect Jabber in my case is to blame and not the contact sync.\nTo make matters worse the Apple contact picture options are really limited. I.e. I cannot simply upload a photo. It has to come from iCloud, or from Camera, or from Photos. Since I don't use the default Mac photos app and do not store my photos on iCloud I cannot upload the right picture and had to resort to copying the file to the app's library folder as described above.\nNot sure if this is an Apple issue with contact sync or Jabber or a Google issue (Gmail should not allow these apps to change the settings surely!), but it is very annoying.\n\nA: I actually ended up deleting the hawk image from inside the Gmail Settings.\n", "Q: How to get custom favorites icons in Safari 8 on Yosemite?

In other words, iog can now only set bits in gIOGDebugFlags, but the new niog can clear bits.  So we specify niog=1 in the boot arguments to clear bit 0.\n\nA: Similar to other posts here, I ended up doing this with a fridge magnet. Flexible plastic ones did not work reliably, so I found one with a small (~5mm diameter) circular metal magnet on the back.

This seems about right compared to the actual lid.\nHope this helps someone, will post an update if anything goes wrong!\n\nA: Lunar can turn off the MacBook display without having to close the lid of the MacBook.\n\nThis allows the MacBook to cool down faster and allows you to keep using TouchID, webcam and the very nice speakers of the MacBook, while being able to focus on the external monitor.\nThe feature is called Blackout, here are some more details: lunar.fyi/#blackout\nHow it works:\n\n*\n\n*Sets the native brightness of the MacBook display to 0\n\n*Sets the Gamma tables of the MacBook display to a list of zeroes\n\n*Mirrors the external monitor to the MacBook display so that:\n\n*\n\n*The monitor keeps its native resolution\n\n*Apps/windows don't get trapped on a non-visible display\n\n\n\nTo activate, just press Control+Command+6 and Lunar will toggle Blackout and do all of the above steps for you.\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar and BlackOut is a paid feature with a free 14-day trial\n\nA: This trick works (make the external monitor as primary one and partially close the lid till display goes off)\nhttp://gizmodo.com/5938452/a-trick-to-make-using-an-external-monitor-with-your-macbook-way-better\n\nA: Go to screen saver then activate the \"display off\" in hot corners.\n\nA: Reducing screen brightness to 0 via the keyboard works for me - Macbook screen is totally dark, but the external display is not affected.\nMy use case is watching a movie on an external display and wanting the Macbook monitor totally off.

Any idea to fix this problem for Yosemite?. Otherwise I will downgrade to Mavericks again. Thanks!!\n\nA: Upgraded to Yosemite 2011 13\" Macbook pro.  Display port to VGA is what I used with Mavericks.  As soon as I updated to Yosemite my macbook would not recognize my external display.  Applecare support were stumped.  Got a Display port to HDMI adapter 3rd party, and voila back in business.  Yosemite does not like display port to VGA adapters.  I tried apple branded VGA adapter and nothing.  As soon as I switched to HDMI all resolutions appeared.   \n\nA: I've had the same issue yet I found that this only happens with some VGA cords. My old VGA have a connection issue that caused the screen to have a yellow or green tint so I bought a new VGA cord and now my mac shows my display's name as just Display instead of Dell Monitor so my solution is I have to plug the old VGA in and get it to recognize the monitor, then without removing the VGA adapter, I plug in the other VGA and it shows full resolution again. It's pretty odd that this happens.\n", "Q: Is it possible to rename \"iCloud Drive\"? I do not like folder names with a space in them...\n\nCan I rename iCloud Drive to another name, say, iDrive?\n\nA: The iCloud Drive item in the sidebar actually points to ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. That said, it is not possible to rename the sidebar item, and do NOT rename the folder. Doing so will likely definitely cause iCloud Drive to stop functioning (if it even lets you rename it).\n", "Q: Can I restore a backup and then begin backing up to a new name? I'm getting an ipad mini and I already have an ipad. I'd like to restore from icloud onto the mini so I can get my apps and savegames, but after that I'd like to diverge the backups so I can configure them both differently.\nI know I can restore from backup onto the new device - after I do that, will it keep the backups separate? Or will the two devices be fighting over the same icloud backup name?\n\nA: They are still two separate devices. Restoring from a backup does not change that.

I started the process using command line program rsync with option -avz but this was very slow. I'm wary of the Finder's copy-paste functionality. What's a fast, fault-tolerant program for copying massive amounts of files from one hard drive to another? \nIf your answer is a command line program, please give an example analogous to this:\nrsync -avz /Volumes/External_1/ /Volumes/External_2\n\nA: You may start by trying the drop the z from the command. There is no need to compress the files when transferring locally.  Rsync will do a checksum after copying a file, which means it has to read the file back out from disk which will always be slower than a straight up copy.  \n", "Q: Can I used the command line to disable settings in Yosemite that have made my Mac visible?

And if you don’t tell it to open the app, it’ll just complain that the app bundle is a directory.\nWhat you needed to do was either type a backslash \\ before the space (this is done automatically if you drag a file into the Terminal window or autocomplete a name by pressing tab):\n$ open /System/Library/Input\\ Methods/PressAndHold.app\nor put quotes around the whole path:\n$ open \"/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app\"\nOr just navigate to the app in Finder and double-click it.\nDoesn’t really answer the problem you asked about, but I hope this helps you in using Terminal.\n", "Q: Is the blue button outline in dialog windows removed in Yosemite when using Tab (keyboard navigation)? Being a zealous user of keyboard navigation, I activated All controls in Full Keyboard Access (Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts). \nIn Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks I was used to having a blue outline on the button/input box that was active, and I could see it move to the next one when pressing Tab.\nAfter updating my OS to 10.10 Yosemite, the outline (now grey) is gone on specific button types and for the large part I cannot see which button is active anymore. When pressing Tab repeatedly in a \"Save\" window the text boxes and switch buttons highlight but drop-downs and regular buttons don't, even though they are active (i.e. pressing Space will act as if I clicked them with a mouse).\nDo more users experience this behavior, or is it just me?

In my company, people use shared Exchange calendars to organize their work. They see all the public calendars in Exchange after they login. Sadly, this doesn't work for me on Mac: after adding the Exchange account in System Preferences I see only my own Exchange calendar and none of the shared ones. I read here about using delegation, but I don't know what e-mail to type there, as others see these calendars just as \"public\". Any hints?\n\nA: The above doesnt' REALLY work for people, especially not with Outlook 365. Here's the way that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*With iCal open go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select iCal, it's to the right of the Apple Symbol in the upper left corner.\n\n*Select Preferences\n\n*Once the Preferences window comes up select the Accounts section then select the Exchange account to bring up its information.\n\n*Now select the Delegation tab.\n\n*Under the list is a + sign. Click this to add a calendar.\n\n*Begin typing the user's name as above and the auto-completion will begin. Once you've found the correct user's name select it to add it under the Users column.\n\n*Under Accounts I can access: you will now see that user's name. You can enable or disable their calendar from displaying by checking or unchecking the boxes under the Show header.\n\n\nI found these instructions from the USC website.\n\nA: The answer from D.Woods is good if the calendar you are trying to access is not being actively updated (for example an office holiday calendar). Otherwise, if other users are actively add and removing appointments, the solution will not keep the calendars in sync. You could work around this by periodically repeating the process but this is less than ideal. \nCurrently, there does not appear to be a general purpose solution for this issue. \n\nA: I just had this problem on mail.app and just figured it out using the instructions on this page.  The instructions on the linked page are for ical.  I don't have access to ical so I can't confirm that it works on ical.  But it works well on calendar.app.  So... I'm hoping it will work just the same for you.  \nHere are the steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Login to Outlook Web Access (the web interface for your Exchange Server).\n\n*Click on public folders (for me, it was all they way in the bottom left).  \n\n*The, navigate to the public folder of your choice (I needed a calendar).  \n\n*Right click on the public calendar and select copy from the context menu.\n\n*Navigate back to your own mailbox (I clicked \"mail\" in the lower left). \n\n*Right click on your own calendar and click paste (I added it to a new folder). \n\n*Return to iCal and refresh (not sure how you do that in iCal).  \n\n\nHope it works as well for you as it just did for me!\n\nA: None of these fixes worked for me. I seemed to find a workaround though. Just FYI my situation was for accessing a shared calendar from Office 365 through iCal on a Mac, El Capitan. I'm running Windows 10 on a separate PC, Outlook 2013.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync the Mail app on the Mac with your Exchange account\n\n*Open Outlook on the PC, Calendars and right-click the calendar you want to share.\n\n*Click \"Share\", and \"Email Calendar..\" \n\n*Send the invite that it creates to yourself in Exchange\n\n*Open up that email in the Mail app on the Mac and double click the .ics file that it should contain. It should open it up in iCal. \n\n*Select the dropdown in the \"Adding a new event\" dialog and select \"New Calendar\" and click OK.\n\n*You should now see it listed under the 'On My Mac\" menu.\n\n*This calendar is synced too so when edited somewhere else, all you need to do is close/reopen the app.\n\nA: I wanted to see calendars that others shared with me in Outlook365, but viewed in macOS Calendar (v11.0).\nThe solution by Dan Gallant helped me out but my reputation points isn't enough to upvote. \n\n\n*\n\n*In macOS Calendar, click the Calendar menu, then Accounts.\n\n*Click Exchange on the left, then make sure Contacts is checked on the right.\n\n*Close this popup window.\n\n*Back in macOS Calendar, click the Calendar menu, then Preferences. You will get a popup titled \"Accounts\".\n\n*Click Exchange on the left, then click Delegation on the right.\n\n*Click the \"+\" button and start typing the full name of the person who shared the calendar with you. Press enter to complete.\n\n\nThe calendar will appear in macOS Calendar, grouped under \"Delegates\". \nBear in mind, that this \"delegation\" does not require the Outlook calendar to be shared with you, with \"Delegate\" permissions. \nThe two mean different things.\n\nA: The unusual answer is to add the person to your contacts app. Just the name and email are enough, this will then populate in the delegates tab in iCal and allow you to add them. It will then get the permissions from the server and the Shared Calendar will appear. \n", "Q: Yosemite update problem Trying to update to Yosemite. Unfortunately I'm encountering the Verify File System and Repair Fail. Ive got no backup whatsoever prior to updating to the new OS. I have Windows and I can boot on that just fine. How do I solve this problem and how do I recover my files on OS via Windows.\n\nA: Paragon HFS for Windows (or similar) might be your only hope, plus some good disk recovery software on the PC - there is a whole slew of freebies for Windows, but I don't know how good they are. Try http://pcsupport.about.com/od/filerecovery/tp/free-file-recovery-programs.htm The list of available software is constantly changing.\nEven if you manage to recover any data, the file names will be gone, so you will then have to dredge through & try to add appropriate names to everything you can recognise.\nThen invest in a backup solution & remember the adage\n\"Any data stored in less than three separate locations ought to be considered temporary.\n", "Q: How to connect an extra monitor and a thunderbolt (LaCie) harddrive on a MacBook Pro (13\" mid 2012)? I have a 13 inch Mid 2012 MacBook Pro and I want to connect my LaCie Thunderbolt hard drive and my extra 21\" Monitor but the MacBook Pro has only one thunderbolt port...\nHow it will be possible?\n\nA: If either your LaCie Thunderbolt Drive offers more than one Thunderbolt port ([https://www.lacie.com/se/products/product.htm?id=10621](like this one)), or you have a native Thunderbolt display, you can \"daisy-chain\" them:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect one device to your macbook (the one with two Thunderbolt ports, e.g. the drive)\n\n*connect the other device (e.g. your display) to the second Thunderbolt port of the first device (e.g. your drive)\n\n\nIf none of your Thunderbolt devices support daisy-chaining (i.e. don't offer a second TB port), then you would need a Thunderbolt Hub.\nAnother possibility would be to connect the hard drive via USB, if it can, [https://www.lacie.com/se/products/product.htm?id=10599](like this one).\nOne caveat though: this should work for any thunderbolt display. If you want to use the DisplayPort adapter, you should check whether it works when it is not connected directly to your Mac.\n", "Q: Yosemite changes QWERTY keyboard layout I have a qwerty keyboard, but I type in french and japanese quite often.\nUp until now, I used to have kotoeri activated with Romaji writing for english and french. I used to write accentuated letters by :\noption + e + letter for  é, ó, etc… \noption + ` + letter for à è ù etc…\noption + i + letter for î, û, ê, etc… \noption + u + letter for ü, ï, ö, etc… \nUnder yosemite, this doesn't work anymore.\nTo get it back I had to activate US International – PC. But it still doesn't work properly. There is a huge bug :\nwhen typing ' then a letter, I get á, é, etc… This is preventing me for writing properly stuffs like\nl'arrosoir  → lárrosoir\nqu'un → quún\nThere are a lot of stuffs like this in french. And even worse, auto-correction kicks in and transforms:\nquún in quant\nHow can I fix this ? How can I still continue typing without learning a new keyboard layout ?\nCLARIFICATION\n=============\nI am talking about several separate bugs.\nBug on U.S. International PC keyboard layout\nWhile using this keyboard pressing option + e then a vowel produces the right output (for instance á) the key 'actually adds an accent to a letter instead of producing the 'character (for instance quelquúninstead of quelqu'un). This is most inconvenient as the character ' alone is quite frequent in french.\nBug on U.S. keyboard layout\nHitting option + e then a vowel has no effect (same for option + u then a vowel, etc…)\n→ Solved by deactivating and and activating again this configuration. This is the only working configuration.\nBug on kotoeri\nKotoeri configuration let the user choose which keyboard configuration to use for romaji. I have selected U.S. as usual, and I have the same issues as with the U.S. configuration below. If I select US International PC, nothing changes, I don't even get the behavior of International PC without kotoeri. This is most definitely wrong.\nUPDATE\n======\nSelecting US Extended yields the desired behavior (the old one from US international PC). However, US Extended is not available for kotoeri.\n\nA: As far as I know, Yosemite Romaji IM's failure to honor option and shift dead keys is a bug that Apple will have to fix via an OS update.  It has been reported elsewhere (e.g. https://discussions.apple.com/message/26864874#26864874  ).  It would be good to use Apple's feedback channel to encourage quick action on this.\nThe OS X 10.10.1 update does not fix this bug in Kotoeri, but the 10.10.2 update of Jan 27, 2015 DOES fix it.\nThe behavior described for the US International PC keyboard layout is not a bug, but intended.  People who use this keyboard want the ` ~ ^ \" ' keys to be dead keys for producing accented characters, and they learn to add a space when they need the stand alone version.\nI have not seen any other reports of the US keyboard layout not working right in Yosemite.  When the US flag is showing at the top right of the screen, you should be able to use the standard option dead keys to produce accented characters without problems.  You should also be able to use the Character Picker, where you hold down the key for the base letter and a popup menu appears where you can select accented versions.  If that is not the case for you, the OS is broken somewhere and may need to be reinstalled.\n\nA: I also upgraded to Yosemite (from Mavericks) on a MacBook Pro with a US Qwerty keyboard. But I do not see any difference in behavior with the keyboard, i.e. all the combinations you indicate (option+e to get \"é\", ...) still work fine for me. I did not make any change during the upgrade.\nMy keyboard is set to plain \"US\" (not \"US Extended\" or \"US International -PC\").\nI only type in English and French, so I don't need any additional combinations.\n\nA: I'm also a kotoeri user, and it took me a while to understand what's wrong.\nIn fact, the former behavior (e.g. option-e, then e = é) is not available\nanymore in kotoeri alphabetic (symbol A in the task bar).\nHowever, it's still available in the US input (symbol american flag in the\ntask bar).\nWhat I wanted to do:\n- Switch between european languages and japanese with command space;\n- Get the former behaviour when in european mode.\nWhat I did:\n- Open the preferences, go to input sources;\n- Remove everything except U.S and Japanese hiragana;\nThen it works again. The only difference is that it used to be either\nalphabet (letter A) and now it's the US input (American flag). And in\namerican mode, you can use all the former option + key combinations.\nThat's it!\nPascal\n\nA: You may want to try Ukelele (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14495/ukelele).\nIt allows you to modify keyboard layouts and save them.\nI just tried and it works on Yosemite.\nGood luck!\n\nA: ' then space will result on a '.  I think this is what you want.\n\nA: A larger issue is that if OS X mistakenly thinks you have a non-Japanese keyboard than the characters like @, #, etc. will be in the wrong place, and there is no way to fix it, as Japanese is not a keyboard option in the Japanese input preferences!  (It will show US, German, etc., almost everything Except the one you need!)  Sometimes you can fix this by forcing the setup assistant to re-run and selecting Japanese keyboard.  This does not work all the time, though.\n", "Q: 'Show Package Contents' in new iWork (Yosemite) File Formats After installing both Yosemite and the new iWork suite updates (Pages 5.5 and Keynote 6.5), I've noticed I can't 'Show Package Contents' in order to access/modify the media associated with these files.\nDoes anybody know how to get in to these seemingly new formats? \nDoesn't seem like a simple unarchive, either...\n\nA: I've managed to expand the file by using the system (or any other) archive utility.\nHere's how I got into the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of the .key, .pages, or .numbers document\n\n*Change the file extension to .zip\n\n*Unarchive as you would any other .zip file to produce a folder\n\n*This folder is similar to previous show package contents bundle representations of older file versions\n\n*Make the changes you need to the document's data — in my case, this was modifying a few picture files that were used as icons throughout the multi-slide presentation\n\n*Re-compress the folder\n\n*Change the resultant zip file's extension to .key or .pages or .numbers\n\nA: The Show Package Contents option is no longer available because iWork documents are now single files.

Magnus Lewan discusses the problems this raises on the Pages FAQ site:\n\nUndocumented Proprietary File Format in Pages 5\nThe new Pages 5 file package format contains binary .iwa files that seem unreadable by other applications. This makes it very difficult or even impossible to recover file content if you are on a computer without Pages 5 or if Apple one day abandons the program. This is a big shift from the XML based file structure of Pages '09 (4.3) and earlier, which at least could be read by text editors, and which in theory could be recovered. \n\nDepending on your needs, you may be able to systematically access the document contents through the applications with an AppleScript.\n\nA: The Pages 5.5.3, Numbers 3.5.3, and Keynote 6.5.3 applications and later have a means to convert the single-file format (com.apple.iwork.pages.sffpages) document format into a package file format (com.apple.iwork.pages.pages).

However since this whenever I had shut down then later logged back in or restarted my macbook I have encountered the screen pictured below. \nMy user profile has no picture and says [update needed] rather than my name. I can still select it, enter my password and log on. An update complete and then everything is ok. The same thing happens every time I go to log on. \nAny ideas of how to solve this\nThanks \n\n\nA: Before decrypting - look in FileVault pref pane and see if there is an error about \"not all accounts can decrypt this disk\" \nClicking this let me supply pw's for the accounts. Once done for all bootable disks attached to the system the [update needed] entry on login window was gone for good. When I did it for my main boot disk (but befrore I booted the carbon copy cloned volume I also keep mounted) the login window showed my accounts again, but still listed the [update needed] entry, presumably because the boot shim on the unencrypted partion still didn't have credentials for all the bootable encrypted disks attached to the system...\n\nIs FileVault (full disk encryption) enabled for your main disk? Because it was in my case, and it proved to be the cause of this error.\nYou can find this setting in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault. During the installation of OS X Yosemite, you can choose if you want to enable FileVault, and it's turned on by default. It's the first version of OS X where this is the default.\nSome people think the \"[Update Needed]\" message has to do with a pending software update, but that's not the case. Your Mac boots from a small (always unencrypted) partition, which will show the login screen. User names and user pictures are normally stored there too, so they can be shown on the login screen. But when things have changed, and your main partition is encrypted, the bootup process can not get to this data as it has no access to your main partition, which is only unlocked after you enter your password.\nTo resolve this, you have to disable FileVault on your main partition, which is named \"Macintosh HD\" by default, and reboot afterwards. When the boot process has picked up your user name and picture, you can re-enable FileVault again.\nDisabling and enabling FileVault can be done from the System Preferences pane mentioned above. You have to click the lock at the bottom of the pane and enter your password first before you can make changes. The process of decrypting and encrypting your drive can take a long time, depending on the amount of data stored on your disk. For me, it was about 1,5 hour to decrypt about 500 GB of data, and an little longer to re-encrypt it again. But you can continue working on your Mac while the decryption/encryption process goes on in the background.\nSo you should disable FileVault, wait for the decryption to end, and then reboot. Afterwards you can re-enable FileVault.\n\n\nA: I got this message too and solved it easily:\nGo to System Preferences;\nUsers and Groups;\nSelect the Admin User and click the padlock to make changes; enter the Admin's password;\nClick on the picture of the Admin; the word 'edit' should appear;\nSelect Camera;\nTake a new picture of yourself and save it;\nLock the padlock again;\nRestart the computer.  You could probably take a different option instead of 'Camera' but I didn't try that. \n\nA: I hit this issue when my Mac booted from an encrypted backup drive after a main disk failure. After clicking the \"[Update Needed]\" user icon and entering in the disk password, MacOS started up from that disk drive.\n", "Q: How to always show window controls in Yosemite full screen apps?

If you have that version on an old backup, that would be one other option.

After a lo-ho-hot of trial and error to get this to work properly I still was not able to find the sweet spot. The problem is simple. I am on OSX Yosemite and use the Mail.APP for my Google Apps for Work account. I like mail that I delete to truly be deleted, it may be moved to trash first, as long as when I delete it, it should truly be removed from Mail and Google. However, now when I delete a mail from the trash I won't see it in my Mail.APP but it does still appear in the Google trash. So technically it still exists.\nMy settings are the following:\nMailbox behavior:\n- Everything checked. (as unchecking it will cause even more weird behavior)\nGmail settings:\n- Automatically remove enabled: update server immediately (default)\n\nA: The challenge is that Gmail uses \"Labels\" to attach to messages, and messages can have zero or more than one label, while IMAP puts messages in folders (Inbox, Trash, etc) and every message is in one, and only one, folder. Thus, when Mail.app tells the Gmail server to delete a message from the Inbox, the Gmail server cannot reliably tell if it should just remove the \"Inbox\" label from that message (leaving it with one fewer label, possibly still having other labels, or maybe no label but still available in the \"All Mail\" view) or if it should more permanently remove the message completely from the database.\nThe \"fix\" is to setup Gmail to not show the messages in multiple IMAP folders (by turning off the \"All Mail\" folder) and to also have the Gmail servers \"expunge\" the message when the Mail.app tells it so rather than doing it \"automatically\", even though that (default) setting on the Gmail server seems to imply that the \"auto\" setting would be what was desired.\nI have not tested ALL of these settings (I mostly rely on the \"30 days in the trash\" feature of Gmail to empty things: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7401?hl=en ) and I have only recently updated to \"El Capitan\", but things do not seem any different from my Yosemite, Mavericks and earlier experiences. Note that as of May 2020 I am still using the same setup in systems up to and including Mojave, but have not done any testing of Catalina. The way the system works seems to be the same using either a \"regular\" @gmail.com account or a \"Google Apps for Domains\" @yourdomain.com account.\nI do, however, have things set so that email does get put into the trash properly on the Gmail side of things, and it looks like there are settings available to delete things immediately, and it works on my system in the way I want it too.\nSo the detailed instructions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*At http://gmail.com/, log in to your account and select the following:\n\"Settings\" -> \"Forwarding and IMAP\"\n\n*Check \"Enable IMAP\"\n\n*For \"When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Check \"Auto-Expunge off - Wait for the client to update the server.\"\n\n\n*For \"When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Check \"Immediately delete the message forever\"\n(I have my system set up to \"Move the message to the Trash\" and rely on the 30 days mentioned above)\n\n\n\nYou need to select the \"Save Changes\" button at the bottom for this to take effect.\nThese settings will only invoke the deletion (or move to Gmail Trash) when the message no longer has any Gmail tags associated with it, or in other words, when an IMAP client removes the message from all of the IMAP folders. Since one of the \"folders\" that can be displayed in a Gmail IMAP client is \"All Mail\", just deleting a message from the Inbox of the IMAP client will not cause it to go bye-bye. Thus we need to limit the \"Labels\"/\"Folders\" that Gmail exposes as IMAP folders:\nOn Gmail, select the following:\n\"Settings\" -> \"Labels\"\nCheck the \"Show in IMAP\" checkbox for \"Inbox\", \"Sent Mail\", and \"Spam\" and UNCHECK the \"Show in IMAP\" checkbox for all of the other \"System Labels\". Any user generated non-system label can be set to \"Show in IMAP\".\nNote that unchecking the \"All Mail\" \"Show in IMAP\" checkbox might make a whole bunch of email that has no other labels (is in no other IMAP folder) no longer be visible in Mail.app or any other IMAP client. Using the Gmail web interface to search up these \"orphaned\" messages and adding the Inbox label or some other label that is shown in IMAP would make them visible again to Mail.app.\nWith the Gmail system set in this manner, I find that the best Mail.app settings to use are to have the \"Mail\" -> \"Preferences\" -> \"Accounts\" set up for the Gmail account in question set so that \"Mailbox Behaviors\" is set to only \"Store on the Server\" for the \"Sent\" and \"Junk\" mailboxes. I have those two boxes checked, and have the boxes for \"Drafts\" and \"Trash\" unchecked. These two need to be unchecked because we have set the Gmail server to not expose those boxes as IMAP folders.\nI only rarely go to the Gmail web interface, doing almost all of my interactions with Gmail through Mail.app or the iOS Gmail app. Some of these settings might have alternative setups if one did a lot of website interactions.\nFor Mark's desired outcome of deleting the messages immediately, the above settings should work - when a message is moved or deleted from the Gmail Inbox and Spam folders, it should immediately be deleted from the Gmail server. The message could still be available in Apple's trash can, but that is not linked to the server's trash can. (If the \"Move the message to the Trash\" setting was set on the Gmail server, the server will move it to the server's trash, and thirty days later, it will be gone). I do not know if Mail.app will send the \"expunge\" signal to the Gmail servers immediately, or only after the local Mail.app trash has been emptied, or on some other synchronization schedule.\nAn alternative might be to have the Gmail server expose the server trash as an IMAP folder and have Mail.app store the trash on the server. With the \"Immediately delete the message forever\" server setting set, this should behave as desired - emptying the trash in Mail.app should cause the Gmail server to delete the message forever. I have not actually tested this immediate deletion setup, so if anyone has any actual experience with this, please let us know.\nThe key to all of these is to NOT expose the \"All Mail\" as an IMAP folder, and to counter-intuitively have \"Auto-Expunge\" turned off so that the options for deleting the mail are available to be selected.\nThis also will not have a direct impact on messages manipulated via the Gmail website - when you use the website to remove all labels from a message, that message will still be in the \"All Mail\" collection, and will not be immediately delete or moved to the trash. It might be necessary to go to the Gmail website and look through the \"All Mail\" collection and dispose of anything that has no labels.\nNote that in Yosemite and later, when you set up an account that Mail.app recognizes as a Google or Gmail account (including accounts of organizations that are hosted at Google), it will not set up the account designated as \"IMAP\", but will instead designate it as \"Google IMAP\" and will select and then grey out the \"Advanced\" setting of \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" which can cause the SMTP account associated with the \"Google IMAP\" account to also have this Advanced setting of \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" to be selected and greyed out, so it cannot be unselected. This also seems to happen when system upgrades happen and mail accounts are updated when the Mail.app program is updated.\nTo force the creation of a \"regular\" IMAP account, one can create a new account in Mail.app but use bogus IMAP server information that Mail.app does not recognize as Google servers (such as \"smtp.notgm.comm\" and \"imap.notgm.comm\"). After the account is created as a \"regular\" IMAP account, my testing indicates that changing the server information to the correct Google server does not change it into a \"Google IMAP\" account, and the \"Automatically detect and maintain account settings\" can (and probably should, if you don't want things to get changed without your knowledge) be unchecked. I do not know if the \"Google IMAP\" account designation has any other features or abilities that the \"regular\" IMAP account does not.\nFor completeness, here are the required settings for Google's Gmail system as of Nov 2015:\nimap.gmail.com\nGmail IMAP user name: Your full Google account address (e.g. \"me@gmail.com\" or \"me@company.com\")\nGmail IMAP password: Your Google account password​\nGmail IMAP port: 993\nGmail IMAP TLS/SSL required: yes \n\nsmtp.gmail.com\nGmail SMTP user name: Your full Google account address (e.g. \"me@gmail.com\" or \"me@company.com\")\nGmail SMTP password: Your Google account password\nGmail SMTP port (TLS): 587\nGmail SMTP TLS/SSL required: yes \n\nLet me know if this works for you and we can update the answer with any detailed improvements you might discover.\nMore info is at https://web.archive.org/web/20151022160428/http://jeffschuette.com/2012/03/07/setting-up-apple-mail-to-rock-and-roll-with-gmail/ and https://web.archive.org/web/20151108133234/http://jeffschuette.com/2013/11/05/apple-mail-and-gmail-part-deux/ for Mavericks where Mail.app handles the \"All Mail\" label better than it previously did. For myself, I have kept the \"All Mail\" label not exposed to IMAP even in Mavericks and have continued with this practice in Yosemite and El Capitan.\nThis article from MacWorld back in 2013 covers some of the same info, and has some screenshots:\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/2048781/how-to-delete-gmail-messages-so-theyre-truly-gone.html\n\nA: This simple method worled for me.

My specific situation is that I am trying to find out whether Apple bumped the system version of libcairo to 1.12.16 in Yosemite from an earlier version of libcairo in Mavericks.\nI can somewhat easily find the version on my current system by inspecting the header files, but I can't seem to find that information online.\nDoes there exist a reference online for all the files included in different versions of OS X, or a way to find versions of system libraries (short of having access to a computer running a specific version of OS X)?\nFailing that, I'd appreciate someone running Mavericks taking a peek in /opt/X11/include/cairo/cairo-version.h and telling me the version listed there.\n\nA: To answer the specific question, in newer releases, libcairo is part of cairo, which is part of XQuartz rather than the Apple-supplied X11 installation. You can find out the supplied version by checking the page for the release in question - for example, here for 2.7.7.\nAs has been answered by Mark, the Apple Open Source site provides listings of all of the open source software included in each release.\n\nA: Look at the Apple pages listing the open source products in each release.

They had a group of trusted people\n  that could become superuser by using the su command.  So they coded\n  their UNIX to only allow people in this specific group to become\n  superuser using su.  They chose the groupname 'wheel', supposedly\n  reference to other systems that had WHEEL, possibly a reference to\n  being a 'big\n  wheel'\nIt's less important now that you have the GUI authorization popups and\n  sudo.  You can use sudo without being in wheel group I believe.\n\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\nModern Unix systems use user groups to control access privileges. The wheel group is a special user group used on some Unix systems to control access to the su command, which allows a user to masquerade as another user (usually the super user).\nIn computing, the term wheel refers to a user account with a wheel bit, a system setting that provides additional special system privileges that empower a user to execute restricted commands that ordinary user accounts cannot access.The term is derived from the slang phrase big wheel, referring to a person with great power or influence.\n", "Q: Toggle Bluetooth AppleScript not Working in Yosemite Prior to upgrading to Yosemite, I used Keyboard Maestro to invoke this Applescript with a shortcut:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane \"com.apple.preferences.Bluetooth\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click button 6 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nIt behaved just as expected, toggling bluetooth whenever I pressed my shortcut. \nIt's no longer working with Yosemite though, I'm sure it has something do with Apple changing the System Preferences pane or the order of icons, but I'm not sure what to change.

I found using \"launch\" instead of \"activate\" will open the app visibly, but not as the foreground window.

Instead of turning off, what actually occurs is that Bluetooth immediately re-enable itself, so the pane is in a fresh state: it's ON, but no connections.\nTo overcome that, one way to to bring SysPref to the front, as in the original answer. Or, run a loop that click the button again (or for a 3rd time) until Bluetooth is really off. That's why there are two variables and a loop in the script. This should make the script more reliable. statName variable records the original status. Loop will continue clicking the button until status has changes. failSafe makes sure the script will not run forever in case of error.

Screen sharing is not the same and quite slow and choppy and presumably intended for occasional usage as opposed to ADR which is for serious use such as headless displays and file transfers.\n", "Q: Shortcut to switch between Today and Notifications in Yosemite While it is possible to set a keyboard shortcut to bring up the Notification Center in Mac OS Yosemite, I cannot find a way to switch between the panels \"Today\" and \"Notifications\" via the keyboard - it only seems to be possible using the mouse/trackpad.\nIs there anything I overlooked?\n\nA: Applescript:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 2\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"NotificationCenter\"\n    click radio button \"Today\" of radio group 1 of window \"NotificationTableWindow\"\nend tell\n\nDepend on what an user needs, whether it's to switch when the menu is pulled out, or to simply access Today or Notifications on demand, one can modify the above code and bind it/them to keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: Just adding this based on fartheraway's answer (because he mentions how to get the Today tab to open).\nHere's how to get it to open on the Notifications tab:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n    click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 2\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        click radio button \"Notifications\" of radio group 1 of window \"NotificationTableWindow\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nNow I just need to figure out how to run these off a keyboard shortcut :(\n\nA: As of Sierra, the menu bar layout has changed.

When I built my Mac Pro 3,1 machine (Early 2008) back in the day, I chose not to get an Airport Extreme card since I only intended to connect it via an Ethernet cable. However, I've noticed that the new Yosemite Handoff feature apparently requires not only Bluetooth 4.0 but also 802.11ac. There is some debate on the web as to whether just getting USB dongles will work, but I figure it is worth seeing if any official products exist seeing how the mini-PCI port used for the Airport Extreme seems to have been used across several models of Macs.\nIs there an 802.11ac Airport Extreme adapter on the market that would work in an old Mac Pro like the macpro3,1? The purpose is to enable Handoff, nothing more.\n\nA: The Apple Broadcom BCM94331CD adapter will add 802.11 a/b/g/n with Bluetooth 4.0 to an older Mac Pro, while the Apple Broadcom BCM94360CD adapter will enable 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac support (the primary difference between the two adapters being 802.11 ac).\nYou can easily DIY by finding suitable parts on eBay or Amazon and following instructions on forum sites such as MacRumors and elsewhere.\nIf you're running Yosemite and want to take advantage of Continuity, you'd then just need to buy a third-party Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle that utilizes the Broadcom BCM20702 chipset (e.g. Asus BT400, IOGEAR GBU521, GMYLE 3340).\nA far easier — albeit more expensive option — is to install an aftermarket Wi-Fi + Bluetooth \"upgrade kit\" from either OS X WiFi or MacVidCards, which will add 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and enable Bluetooth 4.0 LE.\nWith the necessary hardware requirements met for Continuity, you could then use the Continuity Activation Tool to enable support for your particular Mac model.\n\nYou'll then get full native support for all of the new features in OS X 10.10 Yosemite that are part of Continuity, including Handoff, Instant Hotspot and the new AirDrop.\n\nA: My go to for all things Mac accessories is Other World Computing.\nI can't speak to compatibility, Handoff, or anything of the sort, but their site lists one USB 802.11ac adapter, ... and an AirPort Extreme / Time Capsule Mount. Neat.\nI don't see anything about a USB Bluetooth 4 adapter. There's only this Bluetooth 2+EDR IOGear adapter.\nYou may want to contact OWC about Handoff compatibility, I don't know enough about the inner workings to be able to answer that.\n", "Q: \"Share\" button in Preview (10.9.5) I have tried to send pdfs via email from Preview but the app is not letting me.

I have £5.02 left on an App Store card and wish to buy an app costing £1.99 but it asks for a credit/debit card number. How do I get it to come off my credit?\n\nA: Likely the store is just trying to make sure you are the actual person with the account, and so it is asking for verification information rather than wanting to charge your credit card. If you have already entered credit card info in the past, re-entering it will not change any of Apple's data, but will verifiy that you are the same person who set up the account.\nI beleive you can also hit the \"none\" button beside all the credit card icons if you do not have a credit card on file and are just relying on gift card credits.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht2534\n\nA: from: Apple Support\n\nThe entire amount of a gift card is credited to your iTunes Store account when you redeem it, so you don't need to enter your gift card number or gift code each time you want to buy something.\nView your credit balance\nAfter you redeem iTunes Gift Cards or iTunes Gifts, the amount will appear in your iTunes Store account. Each time you purchase content, iTunes will deduct funds from the credit until it's depleted. If you have a credit balance from a gift, it will appear in the iTunes Store, App Store, and iBooks Store on your iOS devices and in iTunes, iBooks for Mac, and the Mac App Store.\nView your balance on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch\nTap the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks.\n      Scroll to the bottom of the Featured tab.\n      Sign in with your Apple ID.\n      If you have a credit balance, you'll see it below your Apple ID.\n\nIt seems unlikely to me you have £5.02 left to redeem from your card, since the entire amount of a card gets credited the first time you redeem it. You should check as stated above if you have enough funds in your account (below your apple ID). If not, that's why you keep being asked to add a new credit card or to redeem a new gift card.\n", "Q: Cloudd quit unexpectedly Ever since I upgraded to Yosemite, I have been experiencing cloudd quit unexpectedly bug reports popping up at front very very often.\nThe issue is : \nCrashed Thread:        0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n\nException Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\n\nApplication Specific Information:\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSGenericException', reason: 'Error opening db at /Users/peter/Library/Caches/CloudKit/CloudKitMetadata: <CKError 0x7f8bc1419590: \"Internal Error\" (1)> (14/0x000e/unable to open database file)'\nterminating with uncaught exception of type NSException\nabort() called\n\n\nApplication Specific Backtrace 1:\n0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff88a6464c __exceptionPreprocess + 172\n1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff89b036de objc_exception_throw + 43\n2   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff88a644fd +[NSException raise:format:] + 205\n3   CloudKit                            0x00007fff83448a47 -[CKSQLite raise:] + 516\n4   CloudKit                            0x00007fff834483b6 -[CKSQLite open] + 122\n5   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b523481 -[CKDMetadataCache init] + 199\n6   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b5233a0 __31+[CKDMetadataCache sharedCache]_block_invoke + 41\n7   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00007fff88e1fc13 _dispatch_client_callout + 8\n8   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00007fff88e1fb26 dispatch_once_f + 117\n9   CloudKitDaemon                      0x000000010b523375 +[CKDMetadataCache sharedCache] + 46\n10  cloudd                              0x000000010b37e541 cloudd + 5441\n11  cloudd                              0x000000010b37e0e0 cloudd + 4320\n12  cloudd                              0x000000010b37eace cloudd + 6862\n13  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff85ebf5c9 start + 1\n\nI do not know if this is relevant, but during 10.9 to 10.10 (yosemite) upgrade, I was asked to log in with my apple ID.

I don't know if it works; it was on when I just discovered it, yet Health app can't find any motion data. I do walk ...\n\nA: It's not a feature that you need to enable. The co-processor starts tracking when you switch on your phone. To answer your question, Health app does not track your steps, it merely only shows you the data that is fed from the co-processor and other health related apps.

I have a 128G SSD for my main drive and it is nearly full, I'd like to move the OS (Yosemite) and all my data to my second drive, a 1TB hybrid drive which is installed in the DVD drive bay.

I also need to add a system recovery to the hybrid drive somehow.\nOptions:\n1) Restore from Time Machine backup somehow.\n2) SuperDuper!\n3) ???\n\nA: To move data from the \"first drive\" to the \"second drive\" you should, before doing anything, backup everything as a security precaution before doing the stuff below. It is also a good idea to run the Software Update on the \"first drive\" to make sure all bug fixes have been made to the software on your current system. Having the latest versions of all software installed on the \"first drive\" can limit incompatibiliites when getting stuff transferred to the \"second drive\".\nIf the second drive is properly formatted for Yosemite, just running the Yosemite installer and telling it to install the system on the second drive should not erase any of the files you currently have on that system, and it should also create the proper recovery partition and install the appropriate recovery software onto it.\nOnce you have Yosemite on the second drive, set it as your startup disk in \"System Preferences\" -> \"Startup Disk\", boot from it, and create an initial administrator account (with a different name from any of the accounts on the first drive so there is no conflict when migrating data from the first drive). You need not give this initial administrator account any AppleID information. Once logged in, it is probably worth updating the system software to the latest, to catch any bug fixes that might not have made it to the installer version that you used for the system as a whole.\nOnce the second drive is updated to the latest software, you need only run /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app and tell it to migrate all the data from the first drive to the second drive. Note that Migration Assistant.app will log out the current user and quit all running programs as it runs, which will unmount any externally connected disks. If the data you want to migrate is on an externally connected disk (such as another Mac in Target Disk Mode) it needs to be plugged into the computer AFTER Migration Assistant.app has quit all the running programs and logged out the current user - waiting untl Migration Assistant.app is searching for appropriate hard drives to get data from is a good time to plug in the external disk.\nMigration Assistant.app could get the data from the Time Machine backup of the old system, but the transfer from an internal drive will be faster than from the external Time Machine backup drive, especially if the external connection is via the network.\nWhen Migration Assistant.app has done its job, you can log into the system, check that everything is as expected and optionally delete the initial administrator account you created on the second drive. All of your data from the first drive should be migrated to the second drive, and the second drive should also have a working recovery partion on it.\n\nA: I would recommend to use the Carbon Copy.app\n\nWith Carbon Copy Cloner, your data and the operating system's data are\n  all preserved on a bootable volume, ready for production at a moment's\n  notice.\n\n\nA: First: backup data. Backing up is always a good safe start to re-arranging data. Defragmenting may also help, depending on the drive type and format.\nSecond: repartition your hybrid drive. Create a (bootable) partition, copy everything to this partition.\nThird: Tell the Mac to boot from the new partition, make everything works before you blow away the old drive.\nDon't want to play with partitions? Use mount points.\nThis is how Linux expands over multiple drives. you need to play with /etc/fstab but the upshot is: a directory on the new drive (example: /foo) gets mounted in the existing filesystem (example: /usr). \n", "Q: SD memory for Time Machine? I am running a MacMini 2013 that has Mac OS X 10.9.3 installed and I want to use SD memory cards with Time Machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use the SD flash memory for a backup drive? \n\n*What is the maximum size supported? \n\n*Is the drive bootable for a recovery option? \n\n*Would anyone recommend doing this? \n\n\nA: While we don't know how large your SD card is, it is likely not big enough to support a backup. The information and link below provides details on how much space to plan for.\n\nAnswer by sameetandpotatoes just here\n\nYou probably want to check out this website for the most information, but here is the answer to your question, quoted from the website above:\n1. How big a drive do I need for Time Machine?\n\nA general \"rule of thumb\" is, to keep a reasonable \"depth\" of backups,\n  Time Machine needs 2 to 4 times as much space as the data it's\n  backing-up (not necessarily the entire size of your internal HD).  Be\n  sure to add the size of the data on any other drives/partitions you\n  want to back up.\n\n\nA: There is a rule of thumb about 2-3x or 2-4x larger Time Machine partition than what is being backed up. So, depending upon your drive/data size, a suitable SDCard may be available. \nHowever, I would worry as well about the speed of an SDCard doing Time Machine backup. Either the card reader/controller might be slow or the SDCard media might be slow. \nSo, it depends on how much data you want to back up, how big an SDCard you have, and how fast it is, as well as how fast your SDCard reader is.\nYes, it is possible to do recovery/boot from an SDCard.\n\nA: I have separated my data onto different drives, using RAID for integrity and availability.\nThe core Yosemite with actual data in use does not exceed 60 GB of space.\nI use time machine with a cheap Lexar 64GB USB3 stick, connected to a USB2 port.\nTime machine runs without any noise - NAND is silent, no moves of the head, no spinning of the drive - or interruption.\nThe advantages: please note that USB Stick = SD card!\n1. Medium is fast, silent, cheap & small\n2. Multi purpose use as backup, repository for e. g. actual data while traveling, use to boot from foreign host, ...\n3. Medium can be encrypted\n4. Medium can be cloned for backup with Disk Utility or ccc within seconds to minutes, instead of CCC wobbling around the disk like there will be no tomorrow\n5.

I was using my Mac normally but suddenly Chrome got stuck. So I held down the power button and force-shut down the Mac.\nWhen I switched my Mac on again, it won't start. I tried to repair my SSD using Disk Utility from Recovery Partition, but it says something is wrong with my Partition Map and that I have to erase and reinstall OS X. But I cannot erase my SSD. The progress bar gets stuck at 50%.\nWhen I used command line diskutil eraseDisk, it shows \"Waiting for disks to reappear\" and is stuck at 50%.\nIs it a problem with my SSD. If yes, will I be eligible for Warranty?\n\nA: It is completely possible that the SSD is toast. It is also possible that Disk Utility just can't fix it. There are other disk repair utilities out there like DiskWarrior, Drive Genius and the like.\nIf you don't have one, you should. you won't use it often but will be glad you have it when stuff like this happens.\nFailing that and assuming that you already have a backup you can boot to the recovery partition and use disk utility to remove the current partition and reformat a new one. Then use internet recovery to re-install the OS.\nIf Disk Utility won't format/re-partition the SSD then the drive is likely toast and you should make an appointment with an Apple Genius to have it repaired.\n\nA: I had the same \"waiting for disk to reappear\".  it was the Hard Disk cable.  it's easy to replace, once you take the HD out.  Cable cost around $40 on ebay.\n\nA: Apple laptops need Trim support for the SSD to work - however this should not be a problem if that hard drive is the original drive that shipped with it. However if it's in warranty you might as well have Apple fix it - a new hard drive is always nice. To check go to https://checkcoverage.apple.com/ and put in your Serial Number which can be found under the Apple logo in the top left and pick About this Mac\n\nA: Power on your Mac, then hold down the Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – R combination immediately upon hearing the startup chime.\nHold the keys until the animated globe appears on the screen. “Starting Internet Recovery,” the message reads. ”This may take a while.” Internet Recovery will download a fresh recovery to your RAM then run that so that your hard drive is completely unrelated to the process.\nRepartition the disk from Internet Recovery and then format and install as normal. This will delete your recovery and files and reset your mac to a fresh install. Sorry there is no alternative without another drive handy.\nI'm pretty sure your standard recovery would not work without a working SSD, so your partition map is probably the reason a reformat doesn't work. This should load directly over the internet and may need you to login to the App Store and WiFi during startup. It will allow you to reformat your entire SSD, deleting all data on it and starting again to ensure any corruption is eliminated.\nIf your drive is faulty, you will probably encounter the same thing again, but this can happen due to improper shutdown or shock.\n", "Q: AppleScript-sent messages pop up as unsent drafts when trying to quit Mail I have a spam processing script that I use to forward spam messages as attachments to my spam filter using the 'send' command in AppleScript. Everything processes and delivers fine, but later when I go to quit Mail, I'll have a new message window pop up with one of the messages that was sent in its own window as if it were a draft I was working on.\nIf I manually send it again, it will do the same with the next message that I had sent with the script, over and over until all of the ones since last open have reappeared. After the last one is re-sent or closed, Mail quits fine. They aren't being stored in my Drafts folder up to this point.\nHere's the relevant part of the script:\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set theNewMsg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theReportSubject, visible:true}\n            tell theNewMsg\n                make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theAddress}\n                make new attachment at after the last paragraph with properties {file name:theTempFileName}\n                send\n            end tell\n        end tell\n\nI've tried visible:true and visible:false and don't see the message appear either way, I assume because it's processed so fast. Is there something I should be doing after 'send'?\nThanks!\n\nA: D'oh! Finally figured it out, and it's all my fault. Setting visible:true is the key. The problem was that I was always editing the original scripts in my ~/Library/Scripts/ folder, but testing them by using the hot key I set up to trigger...duh...the Automated workflow files in ~/Library/Services, which I had not updated.\nPosting an answer in case someone else does something as dumb as I was doing. /headdesk\n", "Q: Importing images from internet to new albums in iTunes I just had an update for iTunes to version 12.0.1.26.

The thing is, it newer \"randomly shut downs\" while I'm on Windows, doing stuff, playing games, etc. - it only happens on Yosemite, and it is a fresh copy on the new SSD and all that. Therefore, I really don't think it's a hardware problem. There is even nothing in the logs at that time (???)\nAfter I installed the new Yosemite OS with Boot Camp (Windows 8.1 Pro) on my brand new Samsung 840 EVO 1TB SSD, my MacBook Pro randomly froze and after a few minutes - shut itself down.\nI even thought it could do something with my USB ports, because of this (only a few keys worked on login when external USB hub with Yeti mic plugged in): Some keyboard keys are not working on login to Yosemite but after some more testing, I can rule that out. It's reproducible with no devices connected over USB.\nThis problem occurs more frequently when I'm watching videos or working with Photoshop and Illustrator at the same time but sometimes it's totally random (but then, why it's not shutting down when I'm playing games on Windows?) I thought this could be a GPU issue, so I installed gfxCardStatus, but no luck here.\nCould this be an \"Automatic graphics switching\" issue or is it something else?\n\nA: I had the same problem since a couple of days. Here's what I've done to (apparently) fix it:\nCreated another Administrator account. Logged onto that account. Removed DropBox, Skype, Viber, Evernote.\nWhy? Those where the only applications my new account did not run, and my new account never experienced any crashes.\nI then got back to my primary account and downloaded the latest version of Skype (7.1) and Viber. I am now running Skype and Viber as before. I had no use for DropBox or Evernote anyway.\nI used to have crashes shortly after restarting. I am now on my second hour with a solid machine. I don't know if this will stay so, but at least you can see if it is any help to you.\n\nA: Just in case this helps anyone. I recently added a Samsung SSD to my late 2011 17 Macbook Pro running Yosemite and after a few week I had the same issue. Screen freeze, sometime grey screen with lines and then auto re boot. First thing I tried was putting back the old hard drive and that worked so it must be an issue with the SSD. Annoying because with the SSD it was so much faster.. \n\nA: There is not much to go on with what you have given.  It could be an Automatic graphics switching issue.  I've also had a bad SSD present similar freezes.  I would recommend performing diagnostics on the Hard Drive, RAM and anything else you can.  Rule out whether or not you have hardware that is failing.  Then from there, you can begin to troubleshoot the OS.  \n", "Q: View TLS Certificate in Safari 8 / Yosemite i've installed the new OS X Yosemite recently.

But how can I access the folder from the User2 account? \n\nA: I assume that by \"I shared\", you mean that you've granted other users permissions to read and/or modify this file. But that's all this action does: Granting permissions. It's only half the way, and usually the second in order. \nThe simplest way (and the only one I know of) for the files to actually be shared between different users, is to have them in your \"Shared\" folder, which can be found in the \"users\" folder.\n\nYou would then access those file from this directory. For your own convenience, you can add this directory to your (left) Finder sidebar for quicker access.\nThere's a relatively recent and quite comprehensive article on sharing folders between users with this method over at MacObserver.\n", "Q: Get full url address on Safari In Yosemite, the new Safari \"hides\" part of the URL, how could I show it without going to the address bar every time?\ne.g. https://www.google.com.br/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=p9lIVJbjCYiX8QfnpoCgBQ#q=stackexchange becomes google.com.br\n\n\n\nA: I found the solution, right after posting...\nGo to Safari → Preferences → Advanced → Show Full Website URL\n\n\n", "Q: Mission control: switch to desktop1 + show desktop I'm bored of pressing 2 key shortcuts\nneed to write a script that tells mission control the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*if not at desktop1, switch to desktop 1\n\n*perform \"show desktop\" (windows will be hidden\\displayed, depending on how they are now)\n\n\nPS: where can i find info on taming Mission Control and Finder?\ncurrently i use it like this:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 18 using {option down, command down} --current shortcut for \"Switch to Desktop 1\"\n    key code 103 --current shortcut to \"Show Desktop\"\nend tell\n\nbut there is no check for \"i'm on desktop 1 already\", and no toggle (show\\hide windows)\n\nA: The in-n-out cannot be avoided with applescript, to my knowledge.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    do shell script \"/Applications/Mission\\\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\\\ Control\"\n    delay 0.5\n    tell process \"Dock\" to tell group 1 to tell list 1 to tell button 1 to click\n    delay 0.5\n\n    do shell script \"/Applications/Mission\\\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\\\ Control 1\"\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: Did you consider using Keyboard Maestro?\nHere you can see how I deal with this.

It worked perfectly.\nTwo days ago, I've upgraded to OS X Yosemite and now it's not working anymore. When I browse to the same location in System Preferences, it's configured. But it doesn't work.\nHow do I fix this, and more importantly, why is this happening?\n\nA: The menu option Select Previous Tab is changed to Show Previous Tab and there is by default key shortcut for it\n⌘ + ⇧ + }  Show Next Tab\n⌘ + ⇧ + {  Show Previous Tab\n\nA: It appears Apple renamed Terminal menus from Select Next Tab to Show Next Tab. Same for Previous. If you just rename the menu titles in your Keyboard Shortcuts accordingly, your shortcuts should start working again.\n\nA: To fix the problem: If you want your old shortcuts back, you can go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts , then rename your shortcuts of Select Previous Tab and Select Next Tab to Show Previous Tab and Show Next Tab respectively. The naming here matters in order for you to see results when you re-open your terminal.\n\nA: I boarded the struggle bus on this for many days. If the change in syntax from 'Show Previous Tab' to \"Select Previous Tab\" mentioned above doesn't work for you, you'll need to make sure you check that whatever your desired shortcut isn't already defined somewhere else in the 'system preferences.' In my case, my favorite tab shortcut of control-arrow was reserved for a mission control shortcut that wasn't reserved in Mavericks.

I think I would like to install Mavericks over Snow Leopard on my Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro because I imagine it is more stable than Yosimite and I'm doing a lot of development on it, for which I want Port Tree (Fink in my case) packages to be available for items like Python, PostgreSQL, etc.\nBut Mavericks doesn't seem to be available on the App store anymore. Tried downloading from CNET, but all I seemed to be finding was an update.\nI am tempted to just install Yosemite and would love to get some input.\n\nA: Apple sells redeemable codes for all OS older than current release up to and including Lion from http://store.apple.com\nSince the SKU change from time to time, you may need to talk or chat with a sales specialist online to get the correct item into your cart.\nI've never had problems just reinstalling the original OS that came with your Mac and then using the App Store to upgrade to a now down-level version of OS X. Also, one you've \"purchased\" the free or paid upgrades, you can always re-download them from older clients in the purchased section.\nBasically, the old OS even going back to 10.6 and earlier are all available for purchase and re-download by either contacting AppleCare or the Apple online / retail stores in your country.\n\nA: You can still get a copy of Mavericks if you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Mac program.  They have a download link to Mavericks available.  It is a cost but your getting genuine downloads from Apple and not 3rd party links.\n\nA: If you can find someone who \"purchased\" (it was free) Mavericks in the App Store while it was available, they can still re-download the Mavericks installer and then copy it to your machine.\n\nA: What I ended up doing is buying a bootable 8gig flash drive of it for $20 on Ebay. Just don't have enough peops locally nor expect to count on getting the value out of the balance on the $99 apple dev package - although that's on my radar now.\n", "Q: Yosemite broke Dropbox toolbar shortcut to reveal files in Finder I just updated to Yosemite, and now I cant access newly added files through the dropdown menu the Dropbox icon in the toolbar provides.\nPreviously it was possible to reveal a newly added file in finder if a file on the dropdown list was pressed(See picture) But now nothing happens!\nAm I the only that has this problem?\n\n\nA: Here is how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart finder via terminal command or just reboot (copy/paste into Terminal: killall Finder && open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app)\n\n*Finder >  Go tab > Go To Folder\n\n*Drag DropBox to the left favorite column\nWorks!  \n\nA: I got it working.

I downloaded and installed latest 2.10.41 build and that fixed it. Until I rebooted. Then, gone again!\n\nA: Yosemite did something to my finder involving Dropbox.  After I downloaded the new os, finder wouldn't work at all.  It wasn't responding and nothing happeneded when I relaunched it.  The only things that I could click on we're the on the top bar and bottom bar. So I starting closing programs until finder worked again.  The culprit was Dropbox. As soon as I closed it finder started working again.\n\nA: Make sure you've got the latest version of Dropbox. It should look like this (note the positions of the buttons is now top-left rather than top-right):\n                              \n\nA: Right now Dropbox's changelog is full of entries like \"More fixes for Finder on Mac OSX 10.10\". I didn't notice your issues, but Dropbox kept hanging since the Yosemite upgrade.\nI just updated to the latest version from Dropbox website, which got me release 2.10.41, and now everything you mention works fine (for now). But from the changelog link, you can download later stable releases which might work better.\nLet me speculate on the reason: while before Yosemite Dropbox used a huge hack to extend Finder, now Apple introduced clean support for Finder Extensions, so the Dropbox integration with Finder was probably rewritten. In theory, this should make things more stable; apparently, though, the new code is not good enough yet.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It was solved when I updated to Dropbox version 2.10.46 and relaunched Finder. You can restart finder with the following Terminal command:\nkillall Finder && open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app\n\nA: Make sure that \"Enable Finder integration\" is checked in Dropbox preferences\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Finder.\n\n*Click the \"Go\" tab.\n\n*Click \"Enclosing Folder\".\n\n*Navigate through the folders until you find your username, then open that folder. \n\n*Scroll down till you see the Dropbox that you wish to lock in the Favourites bar.\n\n*Simply drag and drop this Icon/Folder in the Favourites bar.\n\nA: I had the same problem too. It says it is updated but the files that I uploaded at Finder do not appear in dropbox.com. So i went to pause the sync button and sync them back again. And now it works! \n", "Q: How to view movie taken on Android Lenovo Tab device via Xender on iPhone I have an iPhone 4s, and have installed xender for iOS.

I'm considering getting a display with thunderbolt connection, to use as extra screen space and as docking station (on a macbook pro 2012)\nRight now I'm using a USB hub for all the peripheral devices (music keyboard, soundcard, external harddrive, printer etc.)\nIf I plug that usb hub into the usb port on the display (or directly, without the hub), will it all function as it did before?\n\nA: Yes. The Thunderbolt Display USB ports work well to connect a hub for more downstream devices. There is also enough power for unpowered hubs to connect low power devices like mice and USB flash storage. You will want a powered hub if you have multiple spinning hard drives or devices that you wish to charge from the hub itself. \n", "Q: Is there a way to selectively enable \"Text Message Forwarding\"? Yosemite's new \"Text Message Forwarding\" feature is a great convenience for communicating with friends and colleagues who use SMS for texting, but it has the potentially to fatally* undermine 2-factor authentication schemes that use text messages.\nIs there a way to limit which contacts' text messages can be forwarded?\n\nA: I was totally sharing your concerns, hence my iPhone is forwarding any messages - including those from my bank accounts - although bluetooth on both Mac and iPhone is turned off (and so is wifi on the iPhone, so I assume the forwarding works via cellular data). According to a nice and helpful guy on the Apple-Hotline, there is no such option as filtering which messages will be forwarded and which not.\nBut after thinking about the issue for some while, I do not see it as such a big deal anymore. The 2-factor-authentication is based on the principle of knowing one information (like your password) and possessing something (e.g your phone) to receive a second piece of information which will, put together with the first bit, act as key. The situation with the message forwarding just differs in so far, that the \"thing\" you possess in this case are two things (the phone and the mac). So no breach, imho, since the guy who could possibly steal your Mac still has to know your password.\nIt just does not feel right to have the transaction no displayed on the same device that runs the session and thereby requested the number ;-)\n", "Q: Macbook pro showing \"Starting Internet Recovery\" instead of AHT I try to make a long AHT test on my mid 2014 Macbook Pro.

When my memory is full will it allow me to carry on taking photos and videos and store straight to iCloud or will I get the usual notice saying there is not enough storage space?\n\nA: iCloud storage price : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5879?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nSo it depends if you have a good network connection for download what you need when you want (photos with iCloud, musics with spotify...) or if you want all your photos, all your iWork documents and all your stuff on your iPhone all the time. \nIt depends if you take a lot of videos, if you download a lot of big games from the App Store... \nIn fact, it depends of your money ^^\n\nA: Your new phone will need free storage to take new photos. There is no provision to take a picture directly and have it go to iCloud.\nYou'll want to run a calculation on how many photos and how many hours of video you need in addition to the other data on the device and then weigh that against the increased cost for the 128 GB model.\n\nA: I have a 64GB iPhone 5S. Before that I had a 64GB iPhone 5. And before that a 64GB iPhone 4S. And before that a 64GB iPod Touch.\nEach time I bought one of these & told people the capacity I would hear the same thing: \"Why don't you use iCloud?\" or \"Why don't you use Google Drive?\" or any number of the same thing: Device storage is irrelevant since it's all about magical syncs with storage systems network far away.\nHere is the reality: If networking speeds were great then maybe these arguments have a point. But the reality is not only are networking speeds for mobile devices bad, but they are inconsistent. And if you have ever dealt with wired networking speed issues you'd know that even with a direct connection at gigabit Ethernet speeds, it's never as fast as an onboard system of storage. Never.\nSo in my case, I got these 64GB iDevices because I wanted the max storage available. Mainly for music. \nNow that there is a 128GB iPhone 6 I might get one. But only when the next iteration comes out. Meaning when the iPhone 6S comes out, I will probably get one. And if I do that I will get the 128GB model.\nI'm not a Luddite. I understand the benefits of the cloud concept. And I have an unlimited data plan with 4G LTE. But even with that, the consistent hiccups in the way cloud data transfer works makes it way too much of a headache for me.\nCall me old fashioned but realistic since I like my storage size to be nice & large. And I prefer my connections to be hardwired.\n\nA: Computer memory/space is kind of like the old Hot Rodder's saying, \"if too much horsepower is good, then too much is perfect.\"\nIn other words, if you ask the question and can afford it always get more memory/space on any computing device than you think you might need. Often times you will end up needing it.\n\nA: Using iCloud does not add extra space to the device, at least not in the same sense as extra 64GB do. Things never go directly to iCloud: any new photos or videos have to be kept on the device for some time, until they are uploaded to there and removed from here. Uploading requires time and good internet connection and therefore is not always available, besides, free iCloud only gives 5GB (which is nothing for photo storage purposes), any extra space has to be monthly paid for.\nYour choice is basically as follows: how many photos and videos will you take before you bring the phone to a place with good and cheap internet connection? iCloud can not help when phone is on roaming and without WiFi. For any period without WiFi or unlimited/supercheap LTE, count on phone's own storage only.\n", "Q: \"A descriptive string set at run-time. Don't localize.\"? When I open Safari, in my Bookmarks tab it shows me a pop-up:\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: It appears to be an internal testing message for localization. Are you using a beta version of Safari? or have you in the past? It may be a case of resetting safari content if so.\n", "Q: Fixing a couple of odd problems after I dropped my MacBook I dropped my MacBook (six years old, running OS X 10.6.8) on the ground, and have observed a couple of odd problems since then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I open my MacBook it attempts to eject the CD, makes a couple of violent-sounding noises, fails, and gives up. (Also, the software no longer recognizes that there is a CD in the drive.) Whenever I try software solutions (e.g. drutil tray eject) it does the same.\n\n*Occasionally, roughly every two or three minutes, the computer freezes for about ten seconds. When it does this it often highlights the \"File\" option in the menu at the top.\nOtherwise my MacBook works fine. Anyone know how I might fix these issues? (Especially the second, if I busted my CD drive I can live with that.)\n\nA: *\n\n*It sounds like the CD drive is broken.\n\n*A sign of potential future HDD failure. Does the drive make any clicking noises or any strange sounds? I'd make a full backup and prepare for the worst, especially considering the age of the machine.\n\n", "Q: Unable to do Time Machine backups from MacBook Pro on Mavericks I purchased a MacBook Pro Retina on March 2014 to replace my old MacBook.\nBoth were running Mavericks, but I decided to clone the disk into a partition on the new MacBook Pro and keep the ready installed software as a separate bootable backup partition. I have a 2 TB Time Capsule that I access the internet through. This did back up my new machine until a couple of months ago, and now is not found on the network even though it is still providing me with an internet connection.\nIn Airport Utility, the internet connection is shown along with an unaccessible Time Capsule. If I try to access the Time Capsule it says it was previously part of the network, but cannot be found if I scan for it. If I reboot into the other partition (my emergency boot) the Time Capsule is there and able to do backups.\nIdeally I would like the Time Capsule to show up when I am working out of my main partition rather than the spare bootable but am unable to find any advice on how to correct this. I did successfully restore the main partition a couple of days ago after three days of failing to get Yosemite to work, so I know that it works fine through the other partition.\nI am unsure on how to best move forward with this other than factory reset and hope. Does anyone have any less drastic solution?\n\nA: Troubleshooting Time Machine against a Time Capsule is a very slow process.\nI like to just get a new USB drive and let Time Machine back up there and you can know if the problem is the Mac or the destination.\nDoing that will help isolate what is causing the delay. I would also use a second machine to go into the Time Capsule and delete any \"in progress\" backups while your \"problem Mac\" is doing it's first backup to the USB drive.\n", "Q: Uninstalling macOS App Extensions from System Preferences I'm a developer, but it is more of a user-centric question.\nHow can one \"unregister\" a Finder Sync (or any other, presumably) OS X / macOS App Extension so that it disappears from System Preferences > Extensions?\nI've removed the app that's hosting it (FinderSyncTest), but it still shows here:\n\n\nA: I found my extensions in:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/PlugIns\n\nDelete FinderSyncTest.appex, restart Finder, and it should be gone.\n\nA: Did you create this extension yourself?\nI found that after creating, building, and testing an extension I created that there was some data that lives here:\n/Users/$USER/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n\nthat I needed to blow away and then relaunch the Finder (which can be done with Force Quit) to get the extension to \"die\"\n\nA: Another answer in addition to my previous one: if your extension is actually runnable (i.e.: it doesn't crash when started via System Preferences -> Extensions), find the extension in your Activity Monitor, double click the process, then go to the \"Open Files and Ports\" tab. You'll see the path of your extension listed.\n\nA: I found my location via the \"Open Files and Ports\" location in Activity Monitor mentioned in the other answer.\nThis lead to the location:\n/Users/USER/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2018-10-09/MyApp 10-9-18, 9.35 PM.xcarchive/Products/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/PlugIns/MyAppFinderSync.appex/Contents/MacOS/MyAppFinderSync\nThis archive was 10 days old and I'm not sure why it would have been running. I've been deleting my app since that date, and I believe the extension was being removed from System Preferences.\nI deleted the archives in that location, and the app extension no longer runs (which it was doing before). However, it's still listed in System Preferences. Still looking for a way to fully delete.\nEdit: I started running a new version of the container app, from /Applications/. About 10 minutes later, I went back to System Preferences and toggled the Extension on/off and back to on. This launched the new version of the Extension and everything appears to now be working normally.\n\nA: You need to remove it from DerivedData and restart the finder.\nI use DevCleaner, a free utility on the app store to deal with that:\n\n", "Q: Will Photo Stream go away when iCloud Photos leaves beta? iOS 8.1 is out and there is a public beta for iCloud Photos.\nThere are many differences between the new iCloud Photo service and the old Photo Stream, but for the scope of this question I am only concerned about my iCloud storage space. One of the major drawbacks of iCloud Photos is that it counts against your iCloud storage quota. The current Photo Stream feature, however, does not. It is effectively \"free\".\nMy question is this: \nDoes anyone know if Photo Stream will go away when iCloud Photos is finished and released in iOS 8.2 (or whatever)?\n\nA: This is speculation until Apple makes an official announcement.\nGiven that the iCloud Photos page doesn't mention Photo Stream once, and refers to \"shared albums\" instead of shared Photo Streams, I would guess that Photo Stream will be retired, yes.\n", "Q: Import old OneNote .one files into OneNote for Mac I have some old OneNote files (with .one) extension from those long ago years when I still suffered from Windows.  \nAdditionally I have some current template files with .one extensions.\nI no longer have (or want) access to a Windows machine with or without OneNote.  \nDoes any means exist for me to import such files into my new OneNote for Mac?\n\nA: That post is a little out of date:\nI used the previous version of OneNote for the mac that actually allowed you to open files locally. Now Microsoft will only let you open files on OneNote for the Mac if it is on Microsoft OneDrive (grrr....)\nI tried exporting a section as a .one file and saving it on my OneDrive and OneNote for the Mac would not see the file. So it seems that it won't open .one files and that you would have to open those files on a PC, export them to a OneNote package file and then put them on your OneDrive.\nPerhaps you can find a copy of the older version for the Mac, otherwise it looks like you are out of luck.\n\nA: researched this for last couple of days and found out there is no such option in OneNote for Mac. However, the Windows version can open .One file. So, all I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*borrow my neighbor's windows machine (My Dell wont boot up) created\n\n*Windows user linked to my OneDrive account \n\n*Opened .one file in the OneNote app \n\n*Added the notebook to my OneDrive folder.\n\n*Synched it up on the web. \n\n*I switched over to my Mac \n\n*Opened up OneNote app and added the OneNote notebook from my OneDrive folder that I had added from the windows machine\n\n\nThat is what it takes!\n", "Q: Download app from iPad to iPod touch with different Apple ID How do I download a purchased app on iPad to an iPod touch with a different Apple ID?\nMy daughter purchased an app and put it on her iPad, and I want to put it on an iPod touch that I gave my grandson with my Apple ID.  It won't let us do that.\n\nA: Correct, it won't let you do that.\nYou'd need to re-purchase it on the other ID, or investigate Family Sharing - one credit card, multiple family members, multiple account IDs, shared apps & content, with Parental Control.\n", "Q: Apple Time Machine, Drobo and studio computer I bought an Apple Time Machine.  I have a home studio with several hard drives.  I'm trying to find the best way to setup Time Machine to keep all my storage backed up all the time.\nStudio Computer (12 Core Mac Pro)\n\n\n*\n\n*250 GB - Internal SSD System Drive\n\n*2 TB - Internal Media Drive (Audio Samples, Sample Instrument Files)\n\n*2 TB - Internal Storage 1 (Recording Sessions)\n\n*2 TB - Internal Storage 2 (Recording Sessions)\n\n*(Note: Internal Storage 1 & 2 are used until full and then they are stored away and new drives are purchased to replace them)\n\n\nMacBook Pro (13″ i7)\n\n\n*\n\n*250 GB - Internal SSD (OS X files and software only)\n\n*1 TB - Internal Media (Audio Samples, Instruments, User Folder, Etc.)\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What kind of setup do I need to back all of this up?  \n\n*Do I need a big USB hub with a hard drive connected that mirrors every drive in my system?  \n\n*Do those drives need to be larger than each of the primary drives?\n\n*Should I get a Drobo or some kind of RAID drive?\n\n\nA: I have a similar environment here. \nI would split the task into 2 distinct parts.\n\n\n*\n\n*For changing content, excluding all sample libraries etc. set up a Time Machine; internal, networked, AirPort Time Capsule or NAS-type. To keep any depth of history you will need a lot more space on the Time Machine than you have on the used drives.\n\n*Copy the static content directly to new drives, keep those offsite.\nI would then invest in Backblaze [or similar] to backup the entire studio machine. It will exclude 'system' & only backup 'data'. BB accounts are per seat, so you'd have to consider whether the MacBook needed that too.\nThis would allow you to no longer worry about the mass of unchanging content you acquire & concentrate on the system & project backups. I would also periodically clone the project drive & take offsite.\nThere's an article on NAS compatibility for Time Machine here\n(I don't use NAS myself, I just Time Machine to one of my internal 2TB drives for on-site, short-term backup. I let Backblaze do the heavy lifting, plus physical offsite for projects & sample sets etc.)\n\nA: I am a programmer. I create websites and perform analysis on large sets of data. I have also advised clients on setting up their own servers and designed backup systems for them.\nI assume that these computers and data represent you business and/or your passionate hobby. In either case, I assume that loss of data would be devastating. Based on you brief description, backup is a complex issue for you. You need to answer a variety of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How valuable is the data?\n\n*How expensive is down time? \n\n*How many version files do you need to keep?\n\n\nFor myself, I answer that data is very valuable, downtime is very expensive, and I need to maintain as many versions as possible. \nI never trust my backups to just one backup software. I create a multi-layered backup system using tools. Here is what I do for my computers which I use for both business and personal tasks.\nBuild a dedicated Backup and File Server\nI have an old Mac Pro, setup with 4 internal 3TB drives in two mirrored RAIDs. \nI run CrashPlan, Dropbox, and CarbonCopyCloner on this system. This also acts as file server for most of my large data files for past projects. \nContinuous Archival Backups to Remote Systems\n\n\n*\n\n*I use CrashPlan running on my work stations and MacBooks.\n\n*I backup my entire home directory and any other important data. \n\n*My dedicated Backup & File Server is also backed up via CP.\n\n*I backup to both CP's remote servers AND my own office backup. \n\n*I backup to my office server copy of CP every 30 minutes and to the remote site once a day. \n\n*I pay for CP's remote storage Family Package that provides for 2-10 computers with unlimited data AND unlimited versions. (this is better than many other remote backup providers. \n\n\nI trust CP because I have used their enterprise level offerings, and think they provide more flexibility than similar offerings. However, CP's software lacks a polished interface, and is a Java application so it consume huge amounts of RAM. Additionally, other services may have better data transfer speeds. I know many people like BackBlaze, but it doesn't allow you to backup to your own systems. \nContinuous Archival Backups to Remote Systems, Part 2\nIn 30 years of computing, I have seen backup software have bugs and companies disappear. So in addition to CP, I use Arq and backup to Amazon S3. This backup does not backup my entire home directories, but only key folders and I only run it several times per week. \nFast Recovery Backup\nI use CarbonCopyCloner to make bootable full system backups to external drives. This runs automatically once per day. If my MacBook dies, I can be up and running in minutes by plugging the backup drive into any other Mac I own. Or I can use the backup to hook up to a new Mac and use Migration Assistant to get me running again. \nCCC can run in a client/server mode. So CCC on my MacBook backups up to CCC on my server with an external hard drive dedicated to my MacBook. This is a very advanced setup requires knowledge of configuring SSH with key authentication for your servers root account. If I didn't do this, and only ran the backup locally I would use SuperDuper.\nAnd then there is more...\nThese are more in the realm of increasing redundancy, minimizing downtime, and knowing that critical data is also being backed up somewhere else in addition to the above. \n\n\n*\n\n*I use BitTorrent Sync to keep many of my files in sync between systems. In the past I used DropBox for this. \n\n*I use Git and GitHub for various programming projects.\n\n*I use FastMail for my email IMAP server. \nYour backup situation is unique\nTake the above as general advise. I don't do audio production and my workflows are different. \nFor your use case, I do not think that TimeMachine will be a good backup solution for you. I do recommend that for most of my friends and family's personal needs, TimeMachine is great. But I don't think it is really designed for the advanced needs of most high end computer professionals. \nGiven your huge data needs, I do think that adding a backup server & file server would be a good idea. This could be done via a NAS or a Mac. If you go the Mac route, I would recommend an old Mac Pro with internal HD's or a external ThunderBolt RAID. I think I could build an all new system with a Mac Mini, external RAID and all of the related hardware and software for under $2500. \nRegarding Drobo...\nI initially forgot to comment on the Drobo. I have not used one, but have followed the development closely. I think, these are pretty good systems, but if you research it, you will find plenty of people who also have had problems. \nThe problem for me is the time to rebuild or expand the volume size. It can take days for such systems to rebuild, during which time the performance of the system is slowed and the data is at a higher level of risk if there is an additional drive failure. For these reasons, I personally do not use a Drobo (or RAID 5 and similar solutions). That being said, in your case of needing to preserve HUGE amounts archival Audio files, these might have a place in your backup mix.  \n", "Q: Can you place a shortcut or a link to a website in the dock in osx?

Apple will not release that information to me.

To do so, I'm running a bash script from a spare Macbook running OS X Server. I have one minor and one big issue with my current script, and could use your help.\nThe script is very simple, and I don't need it to be too robust for my purposes: \n#!/bin/bash\nfor host in 192.blah.blah.blah 192.blah.blah.blah 192.blah.blah.blah\ndo\nssh -t $host sudo softwareupdate -ia\nssh -t $host sudo shutdown -r now\ndone\n\nThe minor issue: for whatever reason, if I try to put both of those commands on the same line using ; or && like so:\nssh -t $host sudo softwareupdate -ia;sudo shutdown -r now\n\nor\nssh -t $host sudo softwareupdate -ia && sudo shutdown -r now\n\nit reboots the actual server instead. Not sure where I'm going wrong with the syntax. \nThe big issue: Despite setting up ssh with a public ssh key (using the instructions I found here), I'm still asked to input a password twice per machine when the script runs. I'm positive it's due to our friend sudo, but the commands don't run at all without it. Ideally, I'll set up a cron job at an early point in the morning and have it run this script automatically so that by the time I'm at work, the Macs will have updated and rebooted. I'm sure there is a way to do it, but my Google-Fu is failing me.\nEDIT/PARTIAL ANSWER\nTurns out, even if you put TextEdit into Plain Text mode, it's still using 'smart quotes'. Typing out and saving the script through the Terminal and THEN running it worked like a charm. \n0942v8653 was kind enough to help me out in chat, and also provided a command to disable this 'feature': defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticQuoteSubstitutionEnabled -bool false\nStill looking for a solution to the password issue.\n\nA: The ; and && are interpreted by bash on the local machine. You can see this by running ssh 127.0.0.1 -t env && env: the second time, there will be no SSH_CONNECTION variable.\nYou can quote the entire command to get it to work properly:\nssh -t $host 'sudo softwareupdate -ia && sudo shutdown -r now'\n\nIn my opinion, -t should only allow one, quoted, argument to avoid problems like this…also beware of variable expansion—make sure to put everything in single quotes or escape it with backslashes to keep it from being expanded or interpreted on the local machine.\n\nA: I am not sure about the reboot issue, but setting up a script to run sudo commands without inputting the password is fairly easy. Take a look at Step 4 of this answer I previously wrote (it was for something else entirely, but the steps to enable running sudo without a password are universal).\nNote that actual command to run your script will change to\nsudo ./myscript.sh\n\n\nStep 4: Setting Up sudo to Run Without a Password\nLetting the Terminal command sudo run without a password can be very dangerous. That's why the steps above created the shell scripts in their own directory, so what can actually be run is limited.\nEnter the following command in Terminal:\nsudo pico /etc/sudoers\n\nThen enter your administrator password when prompted.\nThis may bring you to a (mostly) blank screen, or it may have some text in it. If it's blank - that's fine. You'll just paste the below line at the top.

It worked fine for 3 weeks, then two days ago, my MacBook freezes. I restart it, and a Finder symbol with a question mark appears. I open Disk Utility in several ways (connected my old HDD through USB, or used cmd + R), it shows the SSD but I can neither repair nor verify it. When I start the MacBook Pro, it tells me that it cannot read the internal SSD (or something similar). \nThen, I installed the MX100 Crucial SSD (500 GB). It works fine from USB, but once I install it inside my MacBook Pro, I again get the Finder symbol with a question mark. Same for the Samsung: it works via USB, but once its inside, I cannot boot from it. \nI installed the HDD back into the MacBook Pro, and it works fine.\nI didn't find anything similar to my problem on the web, so I'm asking here. What could be the problem?\n\nA: I'm guessing the problem is the cable that connects your hard drive to the logic board.  You can order a new one from eBay, Amazon, or other Apple suppliers, or set up a Genius Bar appointment to have them diagnose and see if it is the issue.\nA family member and I both had similar issues with our MacBooks.\n", "Q: I can't change administrator password on G5 PPC OS X 10.5.8 I have a problem with my G5 PPC with OS X 10.5.8.\nI bought this Mac from an English friend of mine.

For example, there was the command mount -uw / but you didn't put the space between the command switches and the slash. Since that didn't execute the mount that you wanted, I'm not surprised the rest of it didn't work :-)\nAs a side note, though Apple HFS+ installations tend to be case insensitive, it is always possible that case sensitivity is enabled on the computer. As such, you entered the rm .Applesetupdone line incorrectly since it should have been .AppleSetupDone.\nYou'll probably have improved luck with the mount statement, but when working with the UNIX shell you should always be case sensitive and careful with spaces, dashes, quotes, etc. since UNIX traditionally is VERY sensitive to these things and the wrong keystroke can render the OS installation non-bootable.\n", "Q: `Unknown` file download after reload in Safari 8.0 on OS X Yosemite Since upgrading to OS X Yosemite I've experienced that sometimes when reloading a web page (CMD+R) Safari doesn't reload the page but downloads a file named Unknown.\n\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: I suspect it is not an empty file but malware from 'carpet bombing'. Do not attempt to open the file but get info on the file and you should see it is from known malicious sites.

There are literally hundreds of threads on dozens of different internet forums about iOS devices that get stuck on \"Waiting for changes to be applied\" and/or \"Waiting for items to copy\" while syncing.  I have had that problem intermittently for two years, on iOS 6, 7 and now 8, and frankly after trying all of the fixes I have read about, I have given up on trying to solve it.  That's not what this question is about.  What I want to know is:\n\nWhat's supposed to happen during those stages of the sync?\n\nDo those two messages mean the same thing, or something different?  What is iTunes trying to do?  Is it reading from an internal database on the device and comparing it to the iTunes library on the computer?  Is it writing to a device library?  What's it writing?  What file is it working on?  Is there any way to watch the activity that's in progress, either in real time or after-the-fact?\n\nA: Although there is no official documentation by Apple, you can still get some information by watching iTunes and iOS doing their stuff. This can be done by monitoring log files of both, on the iPhone this can be done over an USB connection. Here's a couple of what I've already seen the iPhone doing in the \"waiting for xy\" sync stages:\n\n\n*\n\n*After copying new media to the iPhone, the media needs to be indexed, e.g. there's metadata to be processed, thumbnails need to be created etc. Until that is done, the media can't be displayed correctly in the corresponding iPhone apps, so iTunes waits for the iPhone Media Indexer service to complete its work.\n\n*When copying new apps to an iPhone, the packaged .ipa-files need to unpack and install, e.g. register in the iPhone's homescreen, app lists, file extension databases etc, this is done during that stages of sync.\n\n*The spotlight search might need time to index new files, iTunes waits for this as well (not always, but sometimes!)\n\n*When iTunes transfers files to an iPhone, it always verifies the file's contents in several ways, being it archive integrity or hashes that are compared. These processes do need plenty of time, depending on the size of the transferred data, and iTunes waits for successful verification in order to complete the sync.\n\n*When there are copy failures detected by any of the verification methods, iTunes will copy the files again. Often these processes are not displayed by iTunes, it is done during the \"Waiting for items to copy\"-processing.\n\n*iTunes will also wait for copy processes to terminate successfully, there are streams and sockets to close when data is transferred between computers. Although this should happen instantly, sometimes there are failures and the iPhone needs some time.\n\n*In general, you can say that iTunes utilizes these stages for verification and error correction as well as doing \"completional\" work. They get extremely useful especially when using WiFi sync, which is much more error-prone than USB.\nEdit: To view the log files of an iPhone/iPad, no jailbreak is required. The best tool probably is libimobiledevice, a bundle of free open-source software licensed under LGPL 2.1. It is capable of handling an iOS device without the need of iTunes, so even on Linux machines. Although being designed for Linux machines, it can be run on Mac as well, e.g. by compiling the source code, or, even easier, by installing through homebrew. Although I'm always using it on Linux machines, this should work the same way on Mac OS X.\nYou probably need to pair your iPhone first, use the idevicepair-binary for this. It should find your USB-connected iPhone on its own, if it doesn't, you can try passing the UUID of your device. After pairing succeeded (it will display a success-message to your terminal interface), use the idevicesyslog-application to view the log files of your iPhone. It will connect to the syslog-socket of your device automatically, if it doesn't, you may pass the UUID again. Then all log messages will get posted to stdout on your computer, e.g. to your terminal output.\nThere is proprietary software as well that allows you to read the logs on your iOS device, but libimobiledevice as a command line- and open source-tool should be preferred.\n\nA: I think in \"Waiting for item to Copy\" process iTunes scans the items that are to be copy , counts items and calculates the estimated time of the copy. As many as files to be copied , the waiting time is increased.\n", "Q: How do I share sections from the notebook via e-mail in Microsoft OneNote for Mac? I am utilizing Microsoft OneNote version 15.2.2 on a Mac.  Is it possible to share sections from the notebook via email as an attachment that can be edited, instead of only in the body of the email?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. OneNote for Mac does not support local files in any fashion, including saving them. You are expected to use OneDrive and SharePoint instead. Your best bet would be to use File | Share | Email Page | As Message and paste the body into a TextEdit Document.\n", "Q: Terminal commands not found: Short explanation.\nAfter I've created .bash_profile file and added the line export PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH into it, my terminal stopped working properly. Could you please help me to fix the problem? \nLong explanation.\nAll I wanted and still want is to install Scala.\nI followed this instruction:\n\nMac OS X If you use the homebrew package manager, simply type brew\n  update and then brew install sbt in a Terminal prompt.\nOtherwise, install sbt by following these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Download sbt from here: http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.12.4/sbt.tgz\n  \n*Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice\n  \n*Add the bin/ directory to the PATH environment variable. Open the file ~/.bash_profile in an editor (create it if it doesn't exist) and\n  add the following line export PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH\n  \n  \n  Verify that sbt is installed correctly: Open a new terminal (to apply\n  the changed .bash_profile) using the Terminal application in\n  /Applications/Utilities/ and type sbt -h, you should see a help\n  message from sbt.\n\nFirst, I tried it with Homebrew and followed this instructions. It didn't work well, so I decided to go through the steps above. After I created the .bash_profile file and added the line export PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH (with the valid path, of course), terminal went crazy. Your help is more than welcome! \nEDIT: \nIna:sbt ps1$ echo $PATH\n//Users/ps1/Documents/PS\n\nA: If the path includes spaces, you're going to need to quote it.\nYour line export PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH causes Bash to interpret the PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS part as the full first argument to your PATH—telling export to set the PATH to only the section before the space. If you use export \"PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH\", it will interpret the entire PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH as part of the first argument. By convention, most people only quote the right side of the equals sign, because it looks nicer, it's the only thing that needs quoted, and bash automatically concatenates strings with no spaces between them.\n", "Q: how to re-enable services in an app (Microsoft Remote Desktop in particular) I am fairly confident I could use the service below in MRD before. I am not sure when I lost them, maybe it is related to the Yosemite upgrade (I noticed this on 10.10.0) or some recent MRD update (8.0.9 from Mac App Store). In any case, the Services menu (from the app's menu on the menu bar) lists the services I want to use, but all are greyed out an inaccessible. Why is that? Can one undo this?\nI checked the services under the Keyboard preference pane, and they are enabled.

They will only be offered/enabled when they can be used.\nFor example, a service that is meant to act on a piece of text will only offer itself when text is selected.\nYou can try this yourself in Safari. Select a piece of text in Safari and check the Services menu, you should see numerous options including \"Add to iTunes as a spoken track\" and \"Make New Sticky Note\".

It had to be unlocked for international use. It had to be active on the Verizon System to do the unlocking. The previous owner of the phone kept the sim card so it does NOT have a sim card installed. It is 100% functional on the Tracfone system.  I am not on any plan preferring to add minutes/text/data as I need it.\n\nA: You can use a new phone or a used 4s. The only requirement to use TracFone's Straight Talk BYOP program is that it has to be unlocked, off contract and a clean IMEI. The only plan you can use with iPhone through tracfone is their straight talk ulimited $45 per month (also sold for a discount annual card).

After it has finished downloading, does installing Yosemite require an internet connection to install?\n\nA: No, there is a difference between download and install. Download is to get the files from the Internet, and install is applying the downloaded data.\nHowever on most OS installations, an internet connection is recommended (Sometimes necessary). Sometimes, the installation goes wrong and in that fact, you might need Internet Recovery to fix it. \n\nA: No. All of the information has been downloaded therefore it does not need an Internet connection to install. Just make sure you start the install while on wifi because the installer asks a few questions and it may need wifi to process it. Once answering the questions and it starts the actual install you may take the computer away from wifi\n", "Q: Yosemite install freezes on \"Transfering your Information\" I installed Yosemite on a blank external drive.

Vaguely remember also at 20 minutes.  Also heard reports of similar waits on some of the podcasts that I follow.  I waited think a lot longer (than 20 minutes) and the install finished successfully.    As with all progress indicators, it is an indicator.   Sometimes things take longer.   In general would be very cautious to stop an OS upgrade in the middle.   almost certain to have things screwed up.\n", "Q: Yosemite - Can't add text note at arbitrary position in Preview? Previously, when selecting the \"text\" tool in preview in order to add a note to a PDF, I could specify where to add this text note by clicking on a particular place of the pdf before actually typing in. However now it seems to be not the case anymore: The text box automatically appears exactly in the middle of the current page. This is incredibly inconvenient as I have to drag the them around after typing to put them exactly in place. I can't believe they have dished out such an un-intuitive design. Is there a way to revert to the old fashion, or do I have to change software for PDF?\n\nA: My formal answer to the question: Don't use Preview.app for anything beyond viewing simple PDF documents. In particular don't use Preview.app when you intend to save the document. \nThe obvious (and better) choice is Adobe Reader XI, which does at least not destroy a document when saving it.\n\nA: Well Adobe Reader's slow page scrolling is simply unbearable. In the end I decided to use Skim, which a lot of people seem to be using as default PDF viewer on OS X already. I'll only use Adobe Reader if I'm dealing with very important/complicated document, or if I want to change the background color of the document when I read.\nEDIT April 2017: Now that Adobe Reader's efficiency seems to have been improved considerably, I just switched to it instead.\n\nA: Preview 7.0 has this capability. If you have a backup of your Mavericks installation you can copy Preview 7.0 into your Applications folder and it will coexist with Preview 8.0 (Yosemite).\n", "Q: Attempting to revert to Mac OS X Mavericks, now can't get out of OS X Utilities! Here is my situation:  I have an MBP Retina 2013 with an SSD drive which I ran with Mavericks with no problems for about almost a year now.  I recently upgraded to Yosemite which seemed to work well at first, but I found that it kept freezing up after an hour or two.  This was unacceptable and I was unable to determine the cause so I decided to revert to Mavericks using my Time Machine backups, so I rebooted using cmd R.  I selected Restore from Time Machine backup and followed the steps including unlocking the FileVault.  It began to restore and then said it couldn't continue because of some sort of unspecified error.\nSo I tried to use the disk utility to erase the disk but the erase button was disabled.  I did verify and repair on the Macintosh HD which did not report any errors.  \nThen I attempted to begin a reinstall OS X but that only sees the \"Recovery HD\", it doesn't see my main disk partition so I can't install.\nThen I rebooted, hoping to simply boot back into Yosemite but it continues to boot to OS X Utilities no matter what I do.  Now I try to do a Restore From Time Machine backup and its no longer able to find my Yosemite boot drive!  I try selecting \"Startup Disk\" which doesn't find any startup disks.

If you have cursor focus on display 1 (i.e. Menu Bar is not greyed/faded out), you move the cursor to display 2 with its greyed out Menu Bar and click on a Dock to launch a new app.\nWhere should the new window go? It should go to display 1 because display 1 has the focus. Yet it should also go to display because it's where the Dock that launched it is at.\nTake a step back, there is another question. What should happen when you click on Dock on an unfocused display? Shouldn't focus be switch to the Dock/display before anything else? So launching an app is a double click process. Or more precisely, single-click if the display is in focus, double-click if not. And how do you tell if the Dock is in Focus? Move your eyes all the way up to Menu Bar (or Window Bar of frontmost window).\nThis is not an issue on other OS's. This mess can be trace back to when OS X compromised window focus long ago by place Menu Bar on top instead of in window.

I have not heeded my own advice.  I encountered the same problem. \n", "Q: Can't send outgoing messages in Mac Mail I have a Gmail account which I access using Mac Mail.  I still am able to receive messages but cannot send messages in Mac Mail.  I receive the following message for each unsuccessful attempt to send:\nCannot send message using the server smtp.gmail.com: (and my e-mail address)\nThe SMTP connection to server \"smtp.gmail.com\" failed.\nI called Google for assistance and was on hold for a very long time.  I don't believe I've done anything wrong lately to cause this dilemma. Can anyone offer some assistance?  It will be greatly appreciated.    \n\nA: As stated before, all this means is your outgoing server credentials are incorrect in the Mail App. \nIn order to check the outgoing server's credentials go to  Mail menu > Preferences > Accounts > find your Gmail account. Click on your gmail account then under \"outgoing server\" check what server is chosen by default then click \"edit smtp server list\" at bottom.\nOnce there double check all the server info. Make sure it has your email spelled correct and password correct, make sure authentication is set to \"password\" then make sure you use SSL and use port 465 or 587.\n\nA: I had the same problem. All my settings seemed correct. \"Connection Doctor\" indicated my username/password was incorrect but I thought it was weird since I did get incoming mails. Anyhow, after I re-typed my email address/pw inside the \"edit smtp server list > Advanced\", the outgoing mail went out successfully. BTW, I have 2 gmail accounts configured in Mac Mail, only one of them had this issue. Cheers~\n\nA: This is a common issue with any IMAP account when setting up through Mac Mail. If you are able to receive messages BUT NOT SEND (GMail, Hotmail, Live, etc), the answer is simple :)\nClick Mail > Preferences > Accounts (select yours) > (select) Account Information > Click the Drop Down (smtp.gmail.com, smtp.live.com, etc), select Edit Server List > Advanced > Click the Drop Down Box under AUTHENTICATION, select PASSWORD \nTo find this menu, be sure to uncheck, Automatically manage connection settings.\nEnter your FULL email and password, and the checkbox for default ports and SSL should be checked. \nBasically, you skipped the authentication step when setting up the outgoing emails, so you're sending an email that connects to a server with no credentials, hence the \"unable to send\" message. Hope this helps someone who is new to Mac OS!\n\nA: I have also gotten this error recently and the fix is simple. I am not exactly sure where, but somewhere in the mail app (probably in the preferences) there is a setting to change which outgoing mailbox it uses. When it happened to me it was set to an \"offline\" mailbox and all I had to do was change it to an \"online\" one. Restarting the mail app may be necessary. \n\nA: Encountered this issue also after enabling the 2 step verification. Resolution was to generate a new app specific password for Mail on Mac and added it back to the Outgoing server settings.\n\nA: like user Yaya, I had the same problem. \nAll my settings was double checked by me and it was correct. \n\"Connection Doctor\" indicated my username/password wasn't correct and I decided to try method of user Yaya\nso  after I re-typed my email address/pw inside the \n\"edit smtp server list > Advanced\", \nthe outgoing mail went out successfully.\nbtw, before changing settings in smtp  server lists, i forced shutdown the mail application, then start it again, and only after that try to retype pasw.\nbut as for real its works. all of you should try this method.\n\nA: For Yahoo mail \nHere's the essential steps to get it working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Server name should match your email\n\n*Right outgoing mail port (465) is used\n\n*Authentication method is Password\nHere's the step by step instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get to Mail > Preferences and select the account you are working on. Check the Outgoing Mail Servers (SMTP)\n\n*Click Edit SMTP Server List\n\n*Add (+) Server name: smpt.mail.yahoo.com\n\n*Port: 465\n\n*Select Password for Authentication method.\n\n*Fill in your email account and password.\n\nA: It appears this issue was fixed in 10.10.3 . I have been having the same issue for 6 months and was unable to fix it despite trying all of things that I had read. After I installed the Yosemite 10.10.3 update everything is working fine. Hopefully other people can download the update and it will start working for them as well.\n\nA: None of the answers worked for me. It ended up being that I was connected to an unsecured network (i.e. a public network), so none of the SMPT servers were working. Try connecting to a secure network or use a VPN to resolve the issue.\n", "Q: mavericks 10.9.5 downloaded but not installing I recently updated mavericks 10.9.5 from 10.9, \nit shows on Update Installed in last 30 days, but when I see About my mac info it is still showing 10.9\n \nAgain going to app store and clicking update it ask me to restart, to install the update I have restarted many a times but it is still 10.9 please help as I want to install X code 6.1 for learning swift\n\n\nA: @OP: If you have the update...

It is asking me for my Apple ID and password... I have tried using it, but it won't activate. Please can someone help me to activate my phone.\n\nA: In this case, your problem sounds simple (but as always, simple often doesn't mean easy). Your phone expects a particular Apple ID/password and you are not entering that combo. If one letter in either the email or password is off, it will reject it.\nWith that in mind, you have a few options. It is always possible that someone else has guessed your password, illicitly entered your account, and marked your phone as lost in addition to changing your Apple ID. This is worst case, and if such has happened, your only hope is to contact Apple. Otherwise, your phone is bricked.\nA less pessimistic and probably more realistic outlook would be that you are just entering your credentials incorrectly and that your phone was marked as lost by chance (somehow that's hard to believe).\nIn this case refer to wherever you have your password saved on your computer and carefully copy that in. If you don't have it written down somewhere like 1Password (sorry for being blunt, but perish the thought of not having it recorded somewhere secure) then you will need to log on to appleid.apple.com and reset your password. Then, log in accordingly.\nUnfortunately, computers almost never lie when they say that you entered your information incorrectly.\n", "Q: how to remove Yosemite installer? I had begin the update and left it overbite for download, it downloaded completely but then failed. I started the download again and this time it had finished successfully but I didn't notice it and thought it had failed again so started the download again. When it downloaded about 3 GB I saw the Yosemite installer and upgraded. But now the second upgrade icon is still there. How do I remove it and its data?\n\nA: Nevermind, got it.\nApp Store -> Purchases -> Press Option and you will see cancel.\n", "Q: What are Airport scan requests? I have a lot of logging noise that seems to be malignant, and doesn't scream \"problem\" when I look at it. It is just so frequent that it's almost endless, and that it's related to wireless networking I'd like to know what it means (for various reasons like security or battery life...).\nBeing network related I disabled Bluetooth, and with the Thunderbolt Bridge changed the Configure IPv4 setting to Off. I think it's safe to say all of these messages happen while I'm connected to a trusted network.\nWhat is the meaning of this information that the software engineers decided was worth logging?\nSystem

On Mavericks I achieved this using the Homebrew formula ntfs-3g which depends on osxfuse.\nAfter upgrading to Yosemite, osxfuse is broken.  Homebrew message:\n==> Upgrading osxfuse\nosxfuse: OS X Mavericks or older is required for this package.\nOS X Yosemite introduced a strict unsigned kext ban which breaks this package.\nYou should remove this package from your system and attempt to find upstream\nbinaries to use instead.\nError: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.\n\nI take this to mean that the kernel extension used by osxfuse is completely disallowed in Yosemite because it is not digitally signed by Apple, whereas in Mavericks it was allowed.\nSo, is there any way now to mount and write to an NTFS-formatted USB drive in Yosemite using either open-source software or free, unencumbered (not spyware/malware or bundled with useless toolbars etc.) software from the App Store?\n\nA: This answer is aimed at latest compatibility for OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install latest osxfuse (3.x.x) from https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases or from Homebrew with brew cask install osxfuse.\n\n*Install latest NTFS-3G (2015.3.14) from Homebrew (http://brew.sh/).\nAs follow:\nbrew install ntfs-3g\n\n\n\n*Link NTFS-3G to boot after temporary disabling System Integrity Protection.\n\n\nAs follow:\n[reboot by holding CMD+R to get in recovery mode]\ncsrutil disable\n[reboot normally]\nsudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs\n[reboot by holding CMD+R to get in recovery mode]\ncsrutil enable\n[reboot normally]\n\n\nA: Open Terminal.\nIf you have brewed osxfuse installed, you have to uninstall it, because unsigned kexts are banned now.

Note that it no longer shows up in the sidebar under Devices. You have to navigate to the /Volumes directory to find it.  However, it is now writeable.\n\nNo third-party software required, but you do have to repeat this for every target NTFS volume.\nAdditionally, there is script that can set up everything automatically: http://sourceforge.net/projects/native-ntfs-osx/files/?source=navbar (just succeeded with it on OSX 10.5.5 Yosemite).\n\nA: All recent OS X releases support NTFS natively (read/write)!\nBy default, the drive mounts, and you can browse the files. But it is read-only.  To make the drive writeable, add the following line to /etc/fstab\nLABEL=MyDrive none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nReplace MyDrive with the name of your volume (check the volume name in the Finder when you mount it).\nThen unmount/remount it to see the changes. One convenient way to re-mount the drive is to use Disk Utility:\n\nTo see the drive after mounting it, look under /Volumes in Finder:\n\n\nThis change is permanent. \nTo undo the writability when mounted on this machine, simply remove the entry for this drive from /etc/fstab.\n\nA: According to this thread, as a workaround, you can download and install the osxfuse binaries directly from the project instead of using homebrew:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/osxfuse/files/osxfuse-2.7.2/\nBut it sounds like this won't work if you have brew packages (such as Gluster) that rely on the osxfuse libraries, since they won't appear in your cellar.\n\nA: The best cross platform format I use is vfat. Not ideal, but it works a charm and there's no mess no fuss :)\n\nA: I always use Paragon NTFS. Just try it. You can do read/write from both sides and will forget this barrier for ever.\n", "Q: Jetbrains'IDE can't start after upgrading to OS X Yosemite Yesterday I upgrade my MBP to OSX 10.10 Yosemite, everything went well.

What's going on?\nOS X Yosemite 10.10\ntcpdump version 4.3.0 -- Apple version 59\nlibpcap version 1.5.3 - Apple version 47\n\nI'm actually trying to sudo tcpdump -w - | tee file.pcap | tcpdump -r -, which gives rise to the same problem—however it appears to arise with any form of piped input.\n\nA: This is still an issue with OS X Mojave 10.14.2 (libpcap 1.0.1 Apple 79.200.4, tcpdump 4.9.2 Apple 83.200.2). It's ultimately a bug in Apple's patches to libpcap and tcpdump.\nIn addition to using upstream tcpdump (which is available in Homebrew), you could also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use tshark (part of Wireshark), which works similarly to tcpdump.\n\n*Write the packets to a temporary file.\n\n*Prefix the stream with 4 null bytes:\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -w - | cat <(printf \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\") - | tcpdump -nvr -\nCause (and why inserting nulls works)\nApple has patched their tcpdump such that it tries to read files as PCAP-NG format first:\n#else /* __APPLE__ */\n        pd = pcap_ng_open_offline(RFileName, ebuf);\n\nThey also added a -P option to emit packets in pcapng format.\npcap_ng_open_offline ends up in pcap_fopen_offline_internal(..., isng=1).  This flow calls pcap_ng_check_header early (see if (isng) in pcap_fopen_offline_internal), and on failure, jumps into the bad: label.\nThat bad: label attempts to fseeko to seek the file back to the start:\n bad:\n    fseeko(fp, offset, SEEK_SET);\n    if (p != NULL)\n        free(p);\n    return (NULL);\n\nBut you can't seek a FIFO, so we're still reading from the same spot!  fseeko would return an error, but this error is ignored.\nOn pcap_ng_open_offline returning an error, Apple's patch then calls pcap_open_offline, which follows a similar control flow to normal pcap. However, because the file pointer on the FIFO is still forward by 4 bytes, the next set of headers have the fifo's magics, and so tcpdump gives up.\nYou can work around this by inserting 4 extra NULL bytes at the start of your pipe, with a little shell-script trickery:\ntcpdump -i en0 -w - | cat <(printf \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\") - | tcpdump -nvr -\n\nThis means that when fseeko fails, you'll be in the correct spot in the FIFO for the \"actual\" magic.\nHowever, there are still some limitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*tcpdump -P (Apple-specific pcapng flag) still doesn't work.\n\n*These files are no longer valid pcap files. If you wanted to read it with another tool (or even a non-Apple tcpdump), you'll need to tee the output before cat.\n\n\nThis also works with tshark (which can output pcapng, and doesn't work as a source without this work-around):\ntshark -F pcapng -w - | cat <(printf \"\\0\\0\\0\\0\") - | tcpdump -nvr -\n\nHowever, I wouldn't suggest putting this work-around in anything long term. \nIt will break once Apple fixes this bug, or if your users have a non-Apple tcpdump on OSX (such as with Homebrew).\n\nA: I have the same problem on Mavericks (10.9.5).  It's probably not the best answer but I downloaded the open source version of tcpdump (tcpdump-4.6.2) and put it in my path before the system version and it works with pipes.  Of course, you lose the extra Apple-specific functionality.\n", "Q: Allow Apps won't unlock in Security & Privacy - Yosemite When I was running Mountain Lion I selected \"Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere\" in Security & Privacy. I updated to Yosemite a few days ago. The update set that back to: \"Mac App Store and identified developers\". I want to run some software from elsewhere. When I select Security & Privacy and click the padlock icon, a pane comes up asking me to enter my password. Since I don't have a password I simply click \"Unlock\". The padlock unlocks for a few milliseconds and re-locks far too quickly for me to change the setting. I know that I don't need a password as that pane lets me click Authenticate during software installation from a .dmg\nSo what do I have to do to change Allow apps setting now?\n\nA: You have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily set a password to change the setting.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down Ctrl, click on the app, then click Open from the menu shown.

I verified the dimensions in Preview.\nWhen printing on my HP Officejet Pro 276dw I cannot get it on the paper with the same dimensions. When choosing \"A4\" I get it scaled down too much. When choosing \"A4 borderless\" I get it scaled up too much.\nThe PDF is in A4 dimensions without a crop edge.\nIs there any way to force printing directly as-is?\nA few examples of the behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*A4 at 100% is reduced slightly (about 98%), but placed at the correct height on the paper.\n\n*A4 at 102% is slightly enlarged, and placed about 2mm too high on the paper.\n\n*A4 Borderless at 100% is enlarged just slighly an placed about 5 mm. too high on the paper.\n\nA: Print settings, scale 100%\nOk, I read your question, I have read your comment on @user2236575 answer. Still I am going to point you in the same direction.\nThis is what you need to do for printing without resizing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your PDF in Preview. \n\n*Select 'Print...' in the File menu, or press CommandP\n\n*Within the 'Print' settings window, set the scale to 100%\n\n*and press 'Print' to print at 100% of the original PDF\n\n\nTo check this, I have added a PDF file containing a ruler: download PDF ruler\nPrint this PDF with the instructions above. \nTest your print like this if you do not have got a ruler. An A4 size 29,7cm long and 21,0cm wide. Overlay the wide side of an A4 paper over your ruler, it will measure 21cm exactly.\nIf not, you did print it correctly, but your printer does something wrong or overwrites these settings.\n\n\nA: (By the way, CuisinCocaine's linked pdf is not the A4 size of 210 × 297 mm.)\nI encounter similar problems with my Brother MFC-J6920DW.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you print a document it (longest side) will be reduced to fit within a 3 mm 'virtual' border. For A4 this results in a 98% print.\n\n*When you print a document with 'borderless' paper settings it will be first scaled up until it has a 3 mm bleed (again, longest side). For A4 this is 102%.\n\n\nFor A3 paper these percentages are slightly smaller because the 3+3 mm = 6 mm : 420 mm (longest side of the A3 paper) is less than with the 6 : 297 mm of the A4 paper. It's about 1,428 percent instead of the A4's 2,020 percent.\nI spend quite a few hours trying to find a way to fix this, but I'm afraid it's written into the printer's firmware, at least in the Brothers MFC's and I suspect HP is using the same trick, or at least with the borderless option selected.\nPlease let know if this works for you too: The easiest solution is - oddly enough - to scale back to 98% so it will then print borderless at 100%.\n\nA: In Preview's print dialog you should have the option to 'Scale' (as opposed to 'Scale to Fit'. If you select 'Scale' then you can key in 100% as the scaling percentage, and the image should print full size.\nI can't comment on the specifics of your named printer, as I don't use that machine.\n\nA: You can't.\nYou are printing to a mechanical device that isn't 100% precise, it doesn't pull the sheet through exactly square, it doesn't pull the sheet through consistently the same, it requires a non-printing feeder edge(s), or it's just a low-down crumby printer!\nThe only way you can get this to print exactly as you want is to:\na. finesse your original file to fit the limitations of your printer.\nMy recommendation is to place your pdf in Indesign, print a sample sheet, and then tweak the position and scale in InDesign. Repeat until satisfied.\nb. print to a high end printer on a bigger sheet and cut it to the finished size.\n\nA: It sounds like the printer has trouble with edge to edge printing or is confused about the paper size that is installed (possibly indicated by a shifted image). In my experience it is common to have to print edge to edge jobs on a paper size that is larger than the document size and then trim the paper.\nBut, three things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that your paper tray guides are right on the A4 settings. Printers normally judge the paper size from those guides and if they are a bit off it can be confused about what kind of paper it is printing to.\n\n*See if you get the same behavior with Adobe Acrobat (maybe trying \"print as image\" under the advanced settings).\n\n*Use a larger size paper (A3, A2) and then trim the print to A4 if needed.\n\nA: You cannot use Safari to reliably print documents to proper dimensions in a production environment.\nIf you do somehow hack it to line up properly by adjusting your artwork then it will break in another version of Safari because it will line up differently.\nDoes anybody remember in the 2000s when iTunes would release a breaking update each week, just so that you could not connect iTunes to your non-Apple device, and then the non-Apple-device makers would release an update so it works again and tell you not to update iTunes? It's just like that.\n\nYou must save as PDF, open in Preview and print from Preview. \n", "Q: Family Sharing apps in iOS I've set up the new Family Sharing in iOS. How do I go about sharing a specific app from one Iphone to another?\nDo I need to use iTunes on the desktop?\nDoes it depend upon whether the developer has approved sharing?\nThe app I wish to share is this one:\nTheory Test and Hazard Perception Pro by Deep River Development Ltd\nhttps://appsto.re/gb/rYTHJ.i\n\nA: Once you've set up Family Sharing, everyone can access each others' apps, music, movies, TV shows and books.\nTo download content from another family member, sign into your iTunes account and visit the \"Purchased\" pages in the iTunes store, iBook store or App Store. Simply choose the family member whose content you want, and go ahead and download.\n", "Q: Fix IOS 8.1 Mail Threading to match osx I noticed, after updating I believe, that the inbox of the mail app in IOS 8.1 only lists emails coming in, so making out the back and forth conversation that often replies turn into is impossible.\nOn my mac, it still groups in and outgoing emails in the same thread (ordered by time) so that the conversation becomes apparent.\nI've been looking into turning on the \"send hidden copies to me\" option, but it doesn't seem like a very sustainable option if I'd export my mail to some other client some time in the future. And also, it gets naggy having it notify you for an incoming mail every time you send one out.\nDoes anyone have any other ideas of how to fix this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Tap on the More button after swiping left and you’ll find a new option to show related messages. \nSource : http://www.maclife.com/article/features/50-ios-8-tips-and-tricks\n", "Q: Macbook Pro with Yosemite very slow I've upgraded my mac from Mavericks to official Yosemite. In the first day my mac was normally, but in the second day, it was unusable, very slow and it was not responding, The third day(now) still like that. I dont know what to do, I've already reset pram, reset smc, repaired disk permissions, tried to reinstall Yosemite and nothing changed. I think it can be the file vault that I had activated when I upgraded to Yosemite, but I can't even know the percentage of the process. My MacbookPro is a version late 2011, processor i5 2.4Ghz, 16gb ram, 500gb HD. I would appreciate if somebody could help me.\n\nA: It seems to be a common issue with Yosemite, see e.g. a Mac Rumors thread.\nIn the last couple of days there also popped up several articles complaining about Apple’s current state of its software. You can find a good overview of the most common issues in this article (it’s also worth to skim over the comments as there are issues that aren’t discussed in the article).\n\nA: I used the command in terminal to disable filevault, that is:\nfdesetup status        # to check the status of file vault\nsudo fdesetup disable  # to disable file vault\n\n", "Q: Yosemite won't recognize my (admin) user password I Installed Yosemite and it won't recognize my (admin) user password.\nYes - I am positive that I am using the correct password.\nNo - Caps Lock is not on. \nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: It will be hard to tell what has broken without being logged in, but the solution is easy.\nBoot to the Recovery HD (power cycle the Mac, then hold Cmd-R until the screen goes grey. Then wait about a minute or so and you should get the recovery tools. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718 for details) and reset the password to be what you want it to be. Once you get logged in again, you can look at the logs and patch up your Keychain as needed.\n\nA: It may be related to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6701865 which may be an Apple side bug. +1 it you think it is the same problem.\nIf you are using a network account, try turn off wifi/network about 30s before you shut the machine or leave it to sleep. (bit of a pain though) \n\nA: The same thing happened to me. After a full day and night of struggling and trying every suggestion, I saw Apple made a \"root admin\" user on my computer that I didn't have knowledge of that superseded the admin account I made. So actually instead of typing my admin username, I typed in \"root\" as the username and it worked. Weird. Not sure how that happened. \n", "Q: iPhone 4s getting hot I two days ago got a second hand iPhone 4s.\nI notice that when I start using it, it becomes hot on top right side (if you look from front) and on left top side (if you look from back) near back camera and side steel too.\nIt becomes hot and battery also drops quickly like 9-10% in 12-14 mints.\nI resetted the network settings too but it didn't solved the problem... :(\nPlease tell what should I do. I have no SIM card in it!! I'm using without SIM. I just turn on the Wi-Fi for some seconds then this happens.\n\nA: Hot while using the phone is almost always a short. You might have it serviced if you think it's a fire risk.\nHot while charging can be a bad charger or a bad battery or a short, so you've got the easier problem to troubleshoot / repair.\nAlso - the age of these devices mean that the majority will be failing in one way or another whether the batteries need to be replaced or other issues like corrosion or just failure of another component has caused it to be out of design spec.\n", "Q: Can mount afp share via mount_afp but not via Autofs Current system, OSX 10.9.5\nI've followed the instructions in this MacWorld hint and by reading the Apple doc for Autofs and several other places but I can't get autofs to automagically mount a remote AFP share on my NAS box:\n$ sudo ls -l /private/etc | grep auto\n-rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel     149 28 Jun 09:35 auto_home\n-rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel     256 24 Oct 13:39 auto_master\n-rw-r--r--@  1 root   wheel      97 24 Oct 13:39 auto_nas\n-rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel    1935 28 Jun 09:35 autofs.conf\n\n/etc/auto_master\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n/-                                  auto_nas    -nosuid  # this one is mine\n+auto_master                        # Use directory service\n/net                                -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home                               auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers                    -fstab\n/-                                  -static\n\n/etc/auto_nas\n/Users/USER/Shares/Public   -fstype=afp afp://USER:PASSWORD@nasbox.local/Public\n\nThe permissions on the Shares directory:\n$ ls -al /Users/USER | grep Shares\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 USER  staff     102 24 Oct 13:31 Shares\n\nI've put nasbox.local in /etc/hosts and can ping it fine.

An XML document describes the layout of the extras and where they are located. Apple provides a specification document that you could use if you wanted to build your own package.\n", "Q: Detailed Wi-Fi menu by default When you hold down the option key before clicking on the wi-fi menu, you get all sorts of detailed stuff about your current connection.\nIs there any way of making this the default behaviour? A terminal command perhaps?\n\nA: This is quite a workaround to go through and unfortunately involves paying for a software (unless you're aware of free alternatives)  but thought I'd throw it out there while looking for more details:\nUsing a program like Keyboard Maestro, you can record a Macro that will be the result of a string/hotkey. \nI recorded as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit record\n\n*Pressed and held option key.\n\n*Clicked on Wifi menubar\n\n*Stopped recording.\n\n\nI then set up the trigger to be a hotkey (like CMD+,) or a string like wifio. Both worked. Detailed Wifi menu was opened and waited for my choice.\n\nA: Another workaround for trackpad users is using BetterTouchTool (fortunately free):\nTo configure a gesture:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose \"Trackpads\" (highlighted in orange in the screenshot below)\n\n*Choose a touchpad gesture (highlighted in red)\n\n*Choose predefined action -> Mouse Click Actions -> Option+Click (highlighted in green)\n\n\nIn my example below I have chosen a single finger tap at the top right of the trackpad to initiate an option-click.\nThis only works if BetterTouchTools runs. You may enable \"Launch BetterTouchTools at start up\" in simpe mode in the basic settings or in advanced mode in the settings.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro OS X Version 10.10 keeps crashing ~ HELP!

I'm not ready to commit to Yosemite yet as my primary OS.  So I thought I'd load up a Parallels VM to try it out.  \nAlthough Parallels seems to create the Yosemite .dmg file correctly, it just won't finish loading.  I get messages about having to \"download additional components\" with tens if not hundreds of hours remaining.  If I let it run overnight, I wake up to a message that something failed.\nSo is it not possible to install Yosemite as a Parallels VM? (I'm running Parallels v10.1.0 on a 2014 MacBook Pro)  Has anyone successfully gotten this to work?\n\nA: Yes - I've gotten installs of Yosemite to work on Parallels - but on a Mac Pro. I installed Yosemite fairly seamlessly from a Recovery HD - so you would want to install Yosemite onto an external drive (or SD media if your mac has one equipped) and then virtualize from the Recovery HD if you can't test well enough on a second install of OS X.\n", "Q: My headphone jack and speakers sopped working My headphone jack and my speakers are not working at all. They just randomly stopped when my macbook air was closed. Is there any system preferences that i need to change?\n\nA: The solution is from here and it worked with me:\n\nThere seems to be a bug whereby if the headphones are plugged in when the MBP is put to sleep and are not present when it is rewakened, the headphones stop being recognized. The solution is to:\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the headphones\n\n*Put the MBP back to sleep (close the lid; without an external display hooked up)\n\n*Plug the headphones back in\n\n*Wake the MBP by opening the lid.\n\nThis should fix the problem.\n\n", "Q: How to find items located in subfolders?

With the new line up of Mac Minis we can have up to 16 GB of RAM, and 3.0 GHz CPU, and therefore they can act as a server. But why did Apple just drop the 'Server' keyword from the Mac Mini category?\n\nA: They haven't announced a Server version, it may come later.\nOnly Apple can know that.\nThe 'Server' version was not the same as the regular version, it had 2 HDs, no optical drive & had OS X Server installed, rather than the desktop OS.\nFrom EveryMac\n\nFor all practical purposes, the \"Server\" configuration is identical to its non-server contemporary, but ships with dual hard drives and a pre-installed copy of OS X Server for Mountain Lion.\n\n\nA: Apple has dropped server from its lineup.\nhttp://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/16/apple-discontinues-mac-mini-server-limits-storage-options-with-latest-hardware-refresh\n", "Q: How to view an open file's location?

I never upgraded to Mountain Lion or Mavericks and now that Yosemite has arrived  I thought of upgrading but I find that some of my software will not work with it. So I would like to upgrade to Mavericks for now. Is it still possible to get the free upgrade? I no longer see it listed in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Yes, it is still possible to download Mavericks: http://www.techspot.com/downloads/6268-mac-os-x-mavericks.html\nThat is a upgrade from Mavericks 10.9.4 to 10.9.5 (not a full version of Mavericks which is a 5.3 Gig file.)\nBut maybe the software not working on Yosemite may neither works on Mavericks.\n", "Q: Display spaces in menu-bar on Mavericks How to display the current space number in the menu-bar with Mavericks? Like it had been possible in previous versions of Mac OSX?\n\n\nA: Coincidently the answer I got for another problem solved this one, too: \nTotalSpaces2 displays the current space number in the menu bar.\n\n\nA: To get just the space number without all the overhead from using TotalSpaces, there is a nice little app on github: SpaceId\nwhich will add the space number to the menu bar like this:\n\n\nA: Another possibility is to use SpaceInfo to retrieve the current space number from the command line using\nSpaceInfo --active-space\n\nThis information can then be displayed in the menu bar using an application like xbar\n", "Q: How do I find a specific bug on Apple's Bug Reporter? Apple's Bug Reporter site sometimes provides numbers of related or duplicate bugs, but I see no way to locate the referred-to bug, and the search feature only searches bugs that I've submitted.\nHow do I find a specific bug, not submitted by me, (e.g., using the bug number) on Apple's Bug Reporter?\n\nA: Apple's bug database is private, and as you see, you are only able to review the bugs that you submit. This has been the subject of much debate in the Apple developer community.\nOpen Radar is an attempt to shed light on bugs that participating developers file. It uses the same ID numbers as the real Bug Reporter system, so if the bug referred to is in Open Radar, you should be able to find it by its ID.\n", "Q: Seeing discoveryd error: Basic DNSResolver Return Code is 9 and we are treating it as an error!

One contains OS X, the other is used for raw data storage. \nNow what i would like to do, is create a third partition from some of the remaining space on the 1st (OS X) partition. Essentially, i need to \"fill in\" a third partition in between the two existing, but without affecting the capacity of partition #2. \nI remember that back in the days when i installed Bootcamp it seemed no problem to change my main partition size and add an extra partition, but for whatever reasons, i cannot do that. Disk Utility has completely greyed out all the controls:\n\nI also tried rebooting from a Mavericks USB-Installer Stick and then going to Disk Utility in there, but the result is the same. I hoped it would work there because OS X was not in use - but no.\nWhy is that? Has it become impossible to repartition a drive in use? Or have i generally misunderstood something here?\n(MBP Mid 2014 | 1TB | Yosemite OS X)\n\nA: 1 TB? I presume that's a Fusion drive. Fusion drive can at most have 2 partitions.\n", "Q: Cycle through spaces in Mavericks On Snow Leopard you could \"jump\" from the last space to the first space by hitting cmd+right arrow. \nHow to do this in Mavericks?\n\nA: I haven't tried it, but the app TotalSpaces2 seems to provide this feature:\nhttps://totalspaces.binaryage.com/navigation2\n\nCaveat: \nIn newer versions of macOS they require you to disable SIP when installing.\n\nA: They don't cycle any more, last to first.\nI've found the best solution is to assign a key command to every Space you use & go directly to the one you want.\nI use Ctrl/number.\nAdditional irritation is that Fullscreen apps insert themselves into the 'list' of Spaces, but cannot be called directly.\n\nA: To accommodate for not cycling anymore, you can enter a command for Switch to Desktop 1, i.e. ⌘+shift+→.\n\n", "Q: Lost Dashboard App I have a 3 yr. old MacBook Pro.

I have my Late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro attached to an external display. I use both displays. At night, when I leave my computer, I want to close the lid to put the Mac to sleep.\nSince Lion, there is the famous 'Clamshell mode', which is for a lot of people, but not for me. This causes OS X to switch to single-display mode, using only the external display, if I close it.\nUntil Mavericks I could prevent this by the famous: sudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\" kernel parameter, but since Yosemite, this does not work. Is there any solution? I don't want to plug off my computer for the night or put it to sleep by selecting a menu command. Both solutions are really lame.\n\nA: Unplug or detach the power adapter before you close the lid. \"Closed clamshell mode\" requires the MacBook to be plugged into an outlet to activate.\nI actually discovered this through trial and error but here's proof! :)\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834\n\nA: I had this issue too and came up with a service that monitors your lid state and puts the machine to sleep when the lid is closed: https://github.com/pirj/noclamshell.

I still have the nvram setting applied and so far so good; the only difference is that I have to keep the lid closed and use USB for keyboard and mouse.\nNot perfect but close!\n\nA: I have not found an answer to this yet, but a very \"workable\" workaround.\nI have set a Hot Corner on my mac to \"Put Display to Sleep\". Now before I close the lid, I drag the pointer to the chosen corner with a rather nonchalant swipe across the touchpad. \nAn extra step but works quite well for me. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: When using a redeemed code through Volume Purchase, who owns the copy of a B2B app, ultimately? I've been looking into various distribution options for enterprise-y iOS apps and one question I can't figure out remains: if my client does a volume purchase and chooses to use redeem codes to hand out to the end users, is it still the case that ownership of the app ends up at the end user's Apple ID? Are there any mechanisms (short of MDM) that allow the purchasing client to retain ownership?\n\nA: Here is the relevant excerpt of the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/volume/us/terms.html#VOLUME\n\nCONTENT CODES\n[...] YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE OWNER OF THE\n  REDEEMING ITUNES ACCOUNT WILL BECOME (i) FOR AN APP STORE PRODUCT, THE\n  LICENSEE OF THAT COPY OF THE PRODUCT; AND (ii) FOR AN IBOOKS STORE\n  PRODUCT, THE OWNER OF THAT COPY OF THE PRODUCT, AND SHALL BE ENTITLED\n  TO ALL ASSOCIATED RIGHTS.

So I'm trying to figure out how to downgrade back to OS X Mavericks 10.9. I also stupidly don't have a Time Machine Backup or this would be way easier.\nI learned you could install the old operating system with a clean install from a bootable drive with the installer on it, which I've figured out and made, but I don't know if there is a way to install it with wiping all the data on my system hard drive. I read you can transfer files back and forth from a Time Machine backup, but I can't seem to find out if I make a backup of my computer as it is, now with the current OS X 10.10, would those files and applications be transferrable to a clean install of OS X 10.9. \nIf there is a way to use my bootable install of OS X Mavericks and have it replace OS X Yosemite, and to keep all my files on the hard drive, that would be easiest.\n\nA: Honestly I would make a clone of your current drive onto an external HD. Then boot from it to make sure it works. \nOnce that is done I would boot from your Mavericks install key (unplug your backup drive!), reformat the drive and install Mavericks. Once that is done boot to the fresh install and do all of your updates so you have the latest version of 10.9.\nI would recommend doing all of this from a username/account that is different from the one you normally use. Migration Assistant will re-create your old user account later.\nRe-install your applications (I would do this as there may have been Yosemite-specific) updates that were applied to your apps that Mavericks might not like).\nThen use Migration assistant, point it to your backup drive and have it migrate your documents and settings to the fresh install of Mavericks. I would avoid migrating the apps for the reason above.\nNow, hang onto that backup drive and make another clone before you do any point (10.10 to 10.10.1) or major upgrade (10.9 to 10.10) to your OS, so you can revert more easily in the future. I always do it, yeah it slows down the upgrade, but speeds up fixing the upgrade if it breaks your software.\n", "Q: How to open Cinema Display power supply? My Cinema Display bit the dust, and all the symptoms seem to point to the 150W power supply brick, which is apparently not an uncommon problem with those models.\nNew power supply bricks are close to $200.  Ouch.  Usually one bad component in a power supply is a lot cheaper than that, and I've soldered together a power supply or two in my day.\nUnfortunately, the Cinema Display power supply is built like the monolith from \"2001\", with no apparent way to open it.  Can I use a thin putty knife to crack it open, like the old Mac minis?  Is there some way to get in through the line-in plug?  Is it sealed in a way that can't be opened, but maybe there's a safe(-ish) place to saw through to get inside?\n\nA: Someone did it.\nThere's no good way to open it. Use a Dremel to carefully cut around the seam until it was thin enough to crack apart.\nThere's one huge capacitor (Rubycon KXW 450V 150 uF) that needs to be discharged before the power supply will start up. \nBe careful, because it's charged to over 100 volts. Solder a 600 k ohm resistor across it to bleed off the charge a little faster.\n\nA: If it's anything like this power supply, you'll need to saw it open. Apple's \"non-repairable\" devices are thermally or chemically welded, and there's usually no clean way to open them up.\n", "Q: How to export Contacts version 9.0 data or .abbu file to .csv or other usable spreadsheet format In the newest Apple Contacts version 9.0, how do you export all contacts or an .abbu file to a .csv file or other usable spreadsheet format?

Exporting to Vcard does not work...only exports a small handful of vcards out of over 4,000 and data is not usable in Numbers, Excel, or Outlook/Windows Live Mail.

The iPhone has a great built-in web browser, and since its first introduction it was touted as being able to run the full web, not the watered down mobile versions many phones use. Unfortunately, people have seen the need to \"optimize\" the experience on mobile and as a result, a significant portion of the features I can access on the desktop are simply not available on my iPhone. Furthermore, faulty redirects compound this problem, and make entire pages of content inaccessible.\nI was excited to see the new iOS 8 Request Desktop feature, but due to a faulty redirect I was never on the correct URL long enough to request the desktop version of the site. \nExample: I wanted to go to http://example.com/some_page, but it immediately redirected me to http://m.example.com. Since I was immediately redirected, the Request Desktop link acted on http://m.example.com instead of http://example.com/some_page. This caused me to be forwarded to http://example.com instead of http://example.com/some_page.\nHow can I view the original desktop version of this page on my mobile device?\n\nA: To Request the Desktop version of a website with faulty redirects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on airplane mode to disable all internet access.  \nWarning: This next step will get rid of any open tabs you have in Safari, so make sure you don't have anything important on there.\n\n*Go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data  \n(Many redirects are often cached, so this is a way to prevent it from redirecting you while you are offline.)\n\n*Launch Safari and type in the full desktop url (e.g. http://example.com/some_page)\n\n*Press Go to navigate to the website.  \nObviously this will display the \"Safari cannot open the page...\" error message.\n\n*Tap the address bar again, and scroll down to tap Request Desktop Site.\n\n*Disable airplane mode, and tap the refresh button.  \nIt should now bypass all redirects and request the full Desktop Site.\nUnfortunately this isn't a complete solution since only a small portion of users on mobile devices are going to be using the desktop site for webpages such as these. This means that some things on that site may be broken since they aren't likely to have been tested on mobile devices.\n", "Q: Keep iPad and iPhone apps separate I have an iPhone 4s. It is the 16g model.\nI just purchased an iPad mini 64g.  \nHere is my question: I want to use some apps exclusively on my iPad as my poor iPhone just can't handle all the data. How do I do that?  So far, when I buy apps, they appear on my phone which is already at full capacity.\nThank you!\n\nA: On your phone, navigate to Settings > iTunes and App Store and turn off the switch for automatic downloads for apps.  This will stop the auto download, but if you have purchased the app on one device you can still download it on the second device if you want to, it just won't happen automatically.\nAs is typically the case there are two lines of text following that section of the settings that read \"Automatically download new purchases (including free) made on other devices.\"  So that is specifically what you are turning off.\n", "Q: Does Yosemite support the old Mail view?

I've tested this with OS X Yosemite. Here is a screenshot:\n", "Q: python version 2.7.8 can't run /usr/bin/easy_install. Try the alternative(s): I'm doing a bunch of python development and also just updated OS to Mountain Lion.\nI had replaced to original Python versions with Snow Leopard using the GUI from Python.org, then added links in /usr/bin:\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  71 Oct 22 18:12 python -> ../../../Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7\n\nSo now I have what I think are all the python version that are part of OSX 10.8.5 (2.5, 2.6, 2.7) located in:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\nand linked from /usr/bin\nAnd ALSO the ones I installed with the GUI located in:\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/\n\nBut I'm planning to use the versions I install with fink, which is a port tree similar to macports which are/will be located in:\n/sw/bin\n\nSo I have commented out the PATH exports in ~/.bash_profile that pointed to the non-fink executables:\n#PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}\"\n#export PATH\n\n#PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}\"\n#export PATH\n\nAnd added:\n#  for Fink:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/sw/bin\n. /sw/bin/init.sh\n\nI don't totally understand shell scripting yet, but init.sh initializes fink, I think mostly by adding elements to $PATH and other environment variables.\nPreviously I have installed various packages with homebrew, macports and various GUIs and am hoping to have a more comprehensible environment this time around.\nAt the moment I need to install postgreSQL and a bunch of python modules including pip, virtualenv, virtualenvironmentwrapper, psycopg.\nIt looks like the easy_install executable (binary executable?) lives (alongside easy_install-2.5, 2.6 and 2.7) in /usr/bin/.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any reason to have more than one copy of each version of Python?\n\n*Will python-dependent applications work as long as there's a link in /usr/bin/ to a working, executable python library, and the location of the Python executable is in the $PATH?\n\n*Is there much reason to keep Python2.5 at this point?\n\n*sudo easy_install-2.7 pip worked, so what exactly is -rwxr-xr-x   2 root        wheel       925 Oct 23 14:48 easy_install for?\n\nA: Okay. \nAnswer to number 1 is yes. \nThe fink developers recommend NOT removing the OSX versions of Python, simply because they are not terribly large files and may be necessary for certain OSX functions and programs.\nAnd I want to have an additional version of at least python2.7 installed by fink, because it's a port tree that's designed to create a UNIX-like directory structure, which will hopefully make PostgreSQL and python play nicely together.\nAs far as question number 2, I'm not sure. I think this would work, but leaving the original OSX versions installed avoids the issue.\nQuestion 3: yes. - see answer to question 1. \nMaking the fink version the one that runs via the terminal is a matter of:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure the directory containing the fink python binary precedes the OSX (or GUI-installed one) in the PATH, which can be done in users .profile or .bash_profile (located in directory ~/, the user's root) by either invoking the fink init script, . /sw/bin/init.sh, OR making sure that export PATH=/sw/bin:$PATH is included in the file AFTER any other line that exports a PATH with one of the other python paths at the beginning. For example, export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH or export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH.\n\n*Unless we want to invoke the python cli like python2.7, we'll need to make a symbolic link in the /sw/bin directory that points \"python\" to \"python2.7\", which is done by using sudo ln -s *source* *link*, which in this case looks like:\nsudo ln -s /sw/bin/python2.7 /sw/bin/python\nNot sure what the answer to question 4 is yet, but am seeing that any libraries that exist in /sw/bin are being called from there, as opposed to other installations. Good.\nGot a copy of Learning UNIX for OS X Mountain Lion that looks quite promising.\n", "Q: Why does DNS resolution fail for one user account every 10 minutes on Yosemite? My daughter has a user account on our iMac.  She is not an administrator, and parental controls are not enabled.\nWhen she logs in, she has about ten minutes of connectivity before host resolution fails.  If she logs out, and logs back in, everything is OK for another ten minutes.\nThere is no spyware or malware on the machine.\nWhen I log in as me, I have no such problems.\nThe dig command works fine; it can happily resolve hostnames.  ping fails with an error indicating that it cannot resolve the same hostname.\nWhere should I begin looking to solve this vexing problem?\n\nA: apparently a bug with yosemite... I had the same problem on my son's account... no ping while dig or nslookup were working fine...\nI have updated my mac with 10.10.1  (beta version available for developer) and everything is now back to normal..http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/10/yosemite-10-10-1-build-14b23/\n", "Q: How can I reduce the display resolution in Windows (Boot Camp) on a Retina 5k iMac? tl;dr How can I add additional valid display resolutions to the Retina 5k iMac under Windows 8.1?\n\nSo I just picked up a new Retina iMac, immediately threw Boot Camp and Windows 8.1 on it, and started pulling my Steam games over.\nAll is well except for the fact that the display refuses to switch from it's not-really-native-but-windows-thinks-it's-native resolution of 3840 x 2160. Apparently that's a theoretical max for Windows (or at least AMD drivers) at the moment.\nHowever, since I want to play games in fullscreen (not windowed) modes, I really need to be able to decrease the resolution. How can I do that?\n\nA: I was able to solve this myself by realizing: (a) Windows 8.1 upgrade had changed my display adapter to a Windows Basic Display Adapter, (b) AMD's web site doesn't apparently host installers that work for the Retina iMac (yet?), and (c) the Boot Camp package that Boot Camp Assistant adds to your Windows installer contains a version of AMD Catalyst that will work and will replace the errant driver:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The installer is in <WININSTALL>:\\Bootcamp\\Drivers\\ATI\\ATIGraphics\\Setup.exe\n\n*Run install\n\n*Verify in Device Manager that the Display adapter is AMD...

[How] Would the total amount of computer time possible vary across the multitude of combinations of laptop charging vs discharging over time?\nOS X 10.10, rMBP 15\"\n\nA: First, in answer to the first question: No, a batteries remaining power does not drop consistently regardless of remaining charge.\nThe simplest answer to the rest of the question is: you want to run the power inverter for as little time as possible. The explanation of this and method to accomplish it follows.\nThe power inverter uses some power itself, so you'll want to have it run for as little time as possible. This can be accomplished by only charging the battery up to around 60%-70% and turning off the inverter. The full step by step instructions might look like this:\n1-turn on the power inverter with everything plugged in or ready to plug into the laptop\n2-charge the battery to around 60%-70%\n3-turn off the inverter, running the laptop off its battery until it's quite low again\n4-repeat until the deep cycle battery and laptop battery are both empty.\nCharging the first 60% to 80% of a battery can happen much faster than finishing the last 20% to 40% of the charge. You can easily see this by experimenting with your cell phone or laptop on a near empty charge; just plug it in at about 5%-15% charge and see how much it's charged at 15 minutes 30 minutes and 45 minutes of charging.\nHere are some resources which explain some of these principles in action:\nChart showing how much charge is kept in an unused battery after 6 months -- ( http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batteries )\n\"Ultra-fast charging only applies during the first charge phase. The charge current must be lowered when the 70 percent state-of-charge threshold is reached.\" -- ( batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/ultra_fast_chargers )\n\"As you can see from this one, if your inverter regularly operates below 20% of its rated power then your efficiency is down the toilet!\" -- ( http://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/two-reasons-you-must-look-at-efficiency-curves-when-choosing-your-solar-inverter/ )\n\nA: The remaining time is simple to calc.\nThe battery power vs the consumption rate in this example:\nCharge Remaining (mAh): 4299\nAmperage (mA):  -787 (the consumption)- this is a variable based on computer usage.\nMy computer says I have 5:30 Hours left. (which is about correct 4299/787=5.3)\nHowever, you will notice it is not a liner function.\nThe remaining time goes down much faster that the actual time.\nThat is mainly due to battery discharging faster due to the degraded cell life time. \nThat is why the older batteries do not hold the charge for very long, while showing same charge as new batteries at the BOL.\nsee also this place for more in-depth information on batteries.\n", "Q: iCloud doesn't allow me to backup So I want to backup my Ipod Touch 5 because I'm gonna have to exchange it for a new one and I have tons of photos and notes I would like to back up. I tried backing it up to itunes but its taking a long time and nothing seems to be moving. I deleted all my apps and all the non important photos and decided to try icloud instead. Most websites said I needed to make sure I was under my 5.0GB mark and my Ipod said I had 5.0GB available but when I try to back up it said there wasn't enough available storage. I deleted more photos but it still couldn't backup. I dont want to buy more storage or contact the Apple Support until I'm sure of what's happening..can someone please help me?\n\nA: In order to fit within the 5GB limit for the iCloud backup, you need to have the used space on your device be less than 5GB. Technically, Apps don't count against this, although their documents/data does. There are other items that don't count, as well, you can read more about iCloud backups here.\nYou stated that your iPod had 5GB available, but the space used for the backup is the 5GB that you have in iCloud, it is not on your device. \nIf you have more than 5GB used, as is likely given that it has told you there is not enough available storage, then you will need to either pay to add more iCloud storage, or just use iTunes for free. \nIf it is your first time backing up to iTunes and you have lots of data, it will likely take quite a while, so you should be patient when letting it complete that first backup. \n", "Q: My battery died toward the end of Yosemite installation. Now login screen freezes My Yosemite installation was at \"less than a minute remaining\" for about 5 mins. Then my battery died. When I charged and turned on the power, I got to the Yosemite login screen. When I log in, the password succeeds, then the login screen reappears but the screen freezes.\nI've tried it about 20 times now. Same thing happens every time.\n\nA: Access OS X Recovery by holding Cmd ⌘+R from the time you boot your system until you see the Apple logo. Further instructions:\n\nAfter your computer finishes starting up, you should see a desktop with an OS X menu bar and an OS X Utilities window with the options listed above.\nIn order to reinstall OS X, you need to be connected to the Internet using Ethernet or Wi-Fi. If you're using a wireless Internet connection, click the Wi-Fi menu in the upper-right corner of the screen to select a nearby Wi-Fi network. Choose your preferred network name and enter a username and password to join the network if needed.\n\n", "Q: Second language doesn't show up in keyboard - iOS 8 I use two languages on my iPad. Both show up in settings, but the \"world\" key, used to change from one language to another on the keyboard, has been replaced by an emoticon key. Emoticon does not show up on the list of languages in settings. How do I get rid of the emoticon key and replace it with the \"world\" key on the keyboard?\n\nA: Never mind, figured it out. Went to settings/ keyboard/ added the second language there and deleted emotcon language there.\n", "Q: Sync only accepted Facebook events in iOS calendar If I activate the Facebook calendar sync on my iOS device all events are input in my calendar. Even those I denied. It's there a way to sync only those I accepted?\nIf it's not possible to do it with plain iOS, is there a way through third party tools? (I'm aware that they could log the calendar events)\n\nA: You can use Facebook Event Calendar. Simple, efficient, clever, with options. Read every step carefully, and you'll be able to customize your calendar synchronisation and it works perfectly.\n\nA: This is currently not possible with the standard iOS calendar sync.\nSigning in to Facebook on your iOS device and showing the events on your calendar will synchronise the entire calendar from the server on your device, including events to which you have not accepted. Calendar on iOS or OS X does not respect the response which you have given for the invitation as a method of deciding whether to show the event on your calendar.\nThis is detailed on Facebook's help center with a possible workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=607062449325928\n\nA better solution is not to use the FB calendar integration but instead subscribe yourself to your facebook events. You can do this by going to your events page on the full facebook site on a PC. Click on the cog in the top right hand corner and select export and then select upcoming events - copy the link from that and email it to yourself. Open the email on your iphone and click on the link. That will prompt you to subscribe to you FB events calendar which you should do. All your facebook events excluding declined events will now show in your iphone calendar.\n\nThe cog mentioned in Facebook's answer has been replaced by a link in the bottom right corner, \"Upcoming Events\".\n\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n\nA: Someone created a filter for that, that only puts through the accepted and maybe accepted Facebook events: http://eventcal.flown.io/ \nWorks for Google calendar, and also all system calendars. \n", "Q: Change gtk theme for X11 apps I am using Zim note app http://zim-wiki.org in Ubuntu and I want to use the same in my OS X.\nSo I've installed Zim and can launch it through X11 from menu.

The problem is that I can enter only one Apple ID for Home Sharing on the Apple TV.\nHow do I connect to the second iTunes library without losing the connection to the first one?\n\nA: It is not currently possible to set up Home Sharing with multiple Apple IDs on an Apple TV. As far as I can tell there is no way to share an iTunes library with Apple TV without setting up Home Sharing.\n", "Q: Should I update my apps on iPhone 4s? I have an iPhone 4s. I am not updating to IOS 8 as I have read enough warnings not to do this. All my apps now want to be updated, but most of those updates say that they are for IOS 8 compatibility. Should I do these updates? Will the apps still work normally for me?\n\nA: Yes, you should continue to update your apps. Just because iOS 8 compatibility has been added to an app doesn't diminish the compatibility with earlier versions of iOS.\nIf an app has been updated to support iOS 8 and has removed support for iOS 7, you will not be given the option to update in the first place, however this is rare.\n", "Q: Youtube in Safari cause system crash Regarding MacBook Pro early 2011: sound loop, black screen\nIt happened again and it's the 5th time in one month.

I'm saving data to iCloud in my app using iCloud Documents capability, however I'm not using the Documents folder, instead I'm hiding my files in another folder i.e. User'siCloudContainer/MyFolder.\nI've uploaded some .plist files to this folder but when I receive them using another device they've been given a .icloud extension. What does this mean and how can I get my original .plist files?\nEDIT: It seems that these files have been wrapped by NSFileWrapper during cloud synchronisation.\n\nA: The answer as I have now discovered is that .icloud files are the metadata that precedes the full file being downloaded to a device.\n\nA: From what I can gather, iCloud Drive doesn't want you to create your own hierarchy & drop files where you like, it appears you're supposed to put them in pre-defined locations...\nThis was the best layman's explanation I could find as to how it works; I'm not a dev, so the details would need filling in by someone with more knowledge than me.\niCloud Drive and Document Picker for iOS 8: Explained\n", "Q: Why are Wifi Calling and iPhone Cellular Calls Mutually Exclusive? I tried enabling \"iPhone cellular calls\" on my iPhone 5S, and the phone informed me that Wifi calling must be disabled to enable this feature. So it seems that the two features are not compatible with one another. Is this iPhone 5S specific? This is quite disappointing as I was hoping to have both enabled (cell service in my house isn't the best). It would be nice to know why they're mutually exclusive.\n\nA: In the past, the modem software for a specific carrier was responsible for that prompt as their networks weren't able to re-reount the calls on the fly. (i.e. your carrier or carrier settings needing an update was the original issue)\nI believe that window of limitation is resolved for all devices and all carriers. If you get this error in 2017, I would work with Apple support to make sure your iOS is updated and then work with carrier support to make sure your phone account is set up for seamless switch between carrier and wifi calling.\n\nA: The iPhone cellular calls setting allows you to have other devices signed into your Apple ID use your iPhone's cell connection when they are nearby and on the same WiFi network as your iPhone. If you don't have strong cell service at the house, it's would be the opposite of useful. WiFi calling is the feature to leave enabled.\nEdit: I realized the question was why are they mutually exclusive. My guess is it would cause issues if you tried to use another device to make a call from your iPhone, but your iPhone was in turn using WiFi calling.\n", "Q: is it possible to run a 4k display using an eGPU on a mid 2012 MacBook Pro (non retina) I'm interested in driving a 4k display by using an eGPU.\nI've acquired a Sonnet Thunderbolt ePCI expansion chassis (see here) -- which will allow me to hook 1 double width ePCI card or two single width ePCI cards to my MacBook Pro via the Thunderbolt port.\nIdeally I would like to hook an nVidea based GPU to this setup and then hook it to a 4k Monitor (so I can run CUDA stuff). \nMy primary need is screen real estate -- I do not need to be playing games -- but I do want a crisp display. I was thinking of a Samsung 40\" 4K display like this.\nWould appreciate if you answer addresses the following salient points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this setup possible -- my research seem to indicate it is?\n\n*Is it stable -- does osx have bugs that make this setup non ideal.\n\n*Would nVidea based chip set be preferred (I also want to do CUDA stuff)\n\n*How do I find out if an nVidea card is supported by OSX\n\n*Any limitations on running the 4K display\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: Well, i guess you solved your problem by now, but I still wanted to answer, since I recently looked into eGPU options myself. \nIf your sole aim is to run a 4K monitor (and your GPU doesn't support it), you could probably also get a USB graphics adapter. You find a selection here. This certainly is a much cheaper option, but probably too slow to watch videos, etc.\nIf you are into some more horsepower and want to place a powerful GPU into your Sonnet case, I suggest you take a look at the TechInferno forum. There is a growing community building their own eGPU solutions. If you look at their table with implemented projects, you will also find a number of solutions that used the Sonnet housing.\nHowever, be warned. It is more complicated than just placing a graphics card into your PCIe case. Usually these cases do not provide enough power to run a GPU, and you will have to provide an additional power supply. Since this is all non-standard solutions, you may even have to solder on rather expensive hardware. So proceed at your own risk...\n", "Q: OSX Screenshot App: Can't change screenshot file format I can't get the MacOS screenshot app to change the file format.\nI've tried to change the settings with\n$ rm  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string \"png\"\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"/tmp/\"\n\nrebooted, just in case, but when trying to save a new screenshot, I still can only save it as a .TIFF-image.\nSome additional info: This issue was present even before the update from Mavericks to Yosemite. \nkillall SystemUIServer does not make any difference. \nInterestingly: \n$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture\n{\n    location = \"/tmp/\";\n    type = png;\n}\n\nFile permissions, numeric UID and GID: \n$ ls -lacn  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist\n-rw------- 1 501 20 74 Okt 31 15:59 /Users/jottr/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist\n\nalso, \n$ ls /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist\nls: cannot access /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist: No such file or directory\n\nSo there's nothing in /Library/Preferences/ that could override the settings in ~/Library/Preferences/.\nOS X 10.10 (14A389)\n$ echo $OSTYPE\ndarwin14.0.0\n\nScreenshot App Version: 1.8 (117)\nI checked the File Permissions with diskutil, no errors.\n\nA: Are you using ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+3 and ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+4 instead of Grab.app?

I found that upgrading from 10.9 to 10.10 reverted my default (jpg) to tiff. Annoying, took me a week to figure out. Surprisingly I tried the well documented method as given by the people above, and it worked immediately - but only if prefixed by \"sudo\".\nSo go for this:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg\n\nAnd it worked for me, without restart or killing any process. \nEDIT : some commented below that sudo makes no sense; you are right. Even without, I get it to write to prefs about jpg:\n$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture <enter>\n{\n    type = jpg;\n}\n\n\nA: defaults write com.apple.screencapture type -string \"jpg\"  worked for me. No sudo, just my user account. In 10.10. Thanks.\n\nA: \nStrange; after so many days it works for me still. The annoying bit is\n  that the cmd+ctrl+shift+4 command (screenshot region to clipboard)\n  still uses .tiff although the cmd+shift+4 (screenshot region to file)\n  works with jpg. As a result, my copy-pasted regions to Mail are .tiff\n  and unreadable by many clients. Bummer –  thanosa75 Nov 14 '14 at\n  21:50\n\nI had the same issue and figured out that if you use .png instead of .jpg the copy-paste screenshot to Mail will work. I used the app OnyX to change it... maybe it helps you guys, too. \nIt's a shame that Apple makes the OS always worse with any update... at least it seems like it... \n\nA: If it's working for saved screenshots, but not clipboard screenshots, try changing it to some different format, then changing it back.\nFor example, mine was set to png, but it was only working for screenshots saved as files:\n$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture type\npng\n\nI fixed it by changing it to jpg, then immediately changing it back to png:\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture type png\n\nNow both files and clipboard are .png\nThanks to volker's message above -- that gave me the idea to try this.\nBTW, I didn't use sudo, and didn't kill SystemUIServer.  Neither was necessary.\nDisclaimer: This is true for me on Sierra 10.12.4.  It should be true for everyone else, but I make no guarantee.\n", "Q: Change Appstore user from MacBook? I bought a used MacBook Pro, and I need to update some software.  When I click the 'update all' button to proceed, it asks for the App Store password of the old user's account:\n\nHow do I remove the old user's account so that I can update my software?\n\nA: You will need to go to Store->Sign Out, then sign in with your own account.\nAfter that, delete the software that is asking for the old account password, and reinstall it under your account. If the software is not free, you will need to buy the software again.  You do not have a license to use the software, unfortunately.\nIn your case, there’s only keynote needing an update so you know keynote had that account tied to it. \n\nA: To switch Appstore user you can go to 'Featured' tab -- there link named as \"Welcome \" is clickable and open the window with the button \"Log out\".\n\nA: Since you do not know the previous user Apple ID, unfortunately you will have to start from scratch.\nYou will have to rebuild your computer OS and all Apple applications under your user ID in order to keep it up to date with software updates in the future.\nHere are the detailed instructions how to do that.\nChanging ownership of a used Mac\nI highly recommend the total wipe procedure to remove any possible software remains and modifications from previous user that you do not want. \nThe Operating Software and many app from Apple are FREE anyway.\n\nA: Go to System Preferneces\nCheck the box next to Allow user to reset password using Apple ID.\nThis will let you change the locked Apple ID\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > App Store and change the first drop-down menu in the last section of the window (Purchases and In-App Purchases). This should be enough to force the system re-asking your credentials. If you already set up your account somewhere else, aka iCloud than the username will be automatically filled for you.\n\nA: On Mojave(10.14.4). This is how I tried and changed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open App Store app and click on \"Discover\" option on the left hand side bar.\n\n*Scroll down and click on \"Add Funds to Apple ID\"\n\n*Which then prompts you to add you Apple ID and Password, fill them\n\n*After successful login, it prompts you with account details\n\n\nBy then, the user name and previous Apple Id would get removed and refreshes App Store app and shows the currently signed in user at the bottom on left-hand side bar.\n\nA: The reason why app prompt the old user account is because the app was installed by the old user, and the purchase/install history (App Store called it purchase even the app is free) was made by the old user. \nTo solve this, you need to delete the app first (move to bin) than reinstall it again. Reinstall the app will update the app as well.\n\nA: Yes this process of removing the installed app by moving it to trash and downloading again from store needs to be done for each app individually.\nIs there any way to do it for all the installed apps that need updates?\n", "Q: Is T-mobile iPhone 6 unlocked I bought an iPhone 6 T-mobile from Apple store. I tried my SIM from Sweden and it worked.

It will non-destructively revert Yosemite's unnecessary CoreStorage volume setup into a \"normal\" (non-CoreStorage) setup. I had to run in on a few of the dev previews. You may have to run it as root. \n\nA: @klanomath answer is like killing a mosquito with a surface to air missile (SAM) that cost an arm and a leg.\nThe problem is simple: there is an error in your disk. I had the same issue, exactly. I will recommend you first check if there are errors on your disk, repair it and try Boot Camp once again.\nHow to Check for Errors and Repair your HD:\n\nFirst, you have to shut down your Mac. Then, turn it on and\n  immediately hold down Command + S to enter Single User Mode. Now, type\n  in the following code into the command prompt interface:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\nThen, press Enter on your keyboard. That command checks and repairs\n  inconsistencies in file systems that might prevent you from\n  partitioning your drive. Once that has been completed, type in this\n  code:\nreboot\nHit Enter and your Mac will restart as usual.\nNow, try running Boot Camp Assistant again to install Windows. You\n  should not receive the previous error and will be able to run the\n  installation without any hiccup.\n\nReference: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bootcamp-assistant-cannot-partition/\n90% of the time, this will work. If it doesn't, you can then order for SAM from Lockheed Martin on Northrup Grumman by following the advice of @klanomath\n\nA: You have file vault enabled on that partition, you cannot resize a core storage volume without first decrypting the drives contents. Goto System Preferences->Security & Privacy->Filevault, hit the lock icon on the bottom left and enter your login credentials, push the button labeled Turn Off File Vault, after confirming, you should see a progress bar showing the status of the drive decryption. Once the drive is completely decrypted you can resize the partitions. \nThis will completely decrypt your drives data, so once you are satisfied with your new partition setup and commit them to disk, go ahead and turn file vault back on. Also note the decryption process is not quick, it make take over a day. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Change the background effect in Launchpad on Yosemite In Mavericks I learned that the keyboard combination control+option+command+B would allow the user to cycle through the various background effects (blur, no blur, black and white, etc.).

I recently got a time capsule and I wanted to know if the time capsule uses wifi to copy movies, music ,etc. onto it?\n\nA: Yes. From Apple's AirPort Time Capsule page:\n\nWith AirPort Time Capsule, you get a super-fast Wi-Fi base station and an easy-to-use backup device all in one. And backing up your data couldn’t be simpler. Just set it up once and AirPort Time Capsule does the rest. It works with Time Machine in OS X to back up your Mac automatically and wirelessly, so you never have to worry about losing anything important again. Every photo. Every file. Every song. Even your apps and OS X settings are saved. AirPort Time Capsule stores it all — up to 2TB or 3TB of data.\n\n", "Q: No Partition to install Yosemite to I wanted to have a clean Yosemite installation.\nTherefor I deleted the existing partition to make sure a completely clean installation is made.\nThe problem is that I cannot choose the partition to install to any more.\nAfter accepting the license there is no partition to select from. Except for the recovery partition itself.\nMacintosh HD is still there in the partition tool. but I cannot select it or rework it in any way because all options are greyed out.\nTried booting via recovery partition and stick.\nHow do I get back to having a partition to install to?\n\n\n\nA: This post is for a different problem, but contains the same solution:\nHow do I fix my SSD after installing Yosemite and Enabling TRIM? No boot & can't erase\nI had to go to the terminal (it is available in the installation tool) and do as described in the link:\nUse diskutil list\nand check which volume/partition you want to delete (for me the clue was the size corresponding to my hard drive).\nThen type diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ name disk0.\n\"name \" will be the name of the volume you create.\nClose the terminal, go back to the installation tool and install as you would expect.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite Xcode update stuck on 'Waiting' I recently downloaded Yosemite, and I'm trying to update my Xcode. I hit 'Update' in the App Store, and but it's been stuck at 'Waiting' for the past 30 minutes.\n\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: This simple approach worked for me:\nI did not cancel anything, open AppStore and initiate the update (if you haven't done it yet); then click on the \"Store\" in the top-left menu and choose the following option - \"Check for Unfinished Downloads...\". Enter your Apple ID and password and you everything will be up and running.\nThe reason is that XCode does require additional confirmation before download.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Just wait it out. If you attempted a fix listed in another answer here, quit all applications, restart your computer, and when you boot back up, open the app store to the update page, click the update button and forget about it. It took mine about 20 minutes to actually start and move out of \"waiting\". I read reports that for some people it took about an hour for it to start.\nI tried everything else before and was ready to do a full reinstall of xcode. Nothing worked but for me to just wait.\n\nA: I solved the problem by moving Xcode from my Applications folder to the trash bin. I didn't have an option to cancel the update (all the buttons under Update in the App Store were grayed out for me).\nOnce I typed in my password to confirm the move, the App Store prompted me to either cancel the update, or delete the app. Opting to delete the app caused the update to start downloading immediately.\n\nA: Yeah, a lot of people have been facing this issue. First, cancel your update. (In the AppStore update window hold Option to show the Cancel button.)\nNow, you can do two things:\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the Xcode DMG from here (if you have an Apple Developer Account)\n\n\n*Or try clearing your cache, and restart the download from the app store. You can use third-party apps or enter this command in your terminal:\nrm -rf \"$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.appstore\"\n\nA: Just to add another answer here, I had two versions of Xcode in the launchpad. Opening one brought up a dialogue box asking if I would like to \"Install additional components\", which seems to have fixed it. \nApart from the two copies of Xcode. And now that Xcode is running, the \"upgrade\" is downloading. See what happens....\n\nA: Yesterday this happened to me during regular check for updates,\n and between multiple restarts, and removing manifest.plist \nthings started working again.\nrm \"$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.appstore/manifest.plist\"\n\n( I actually did some renaming to discover that this was the file of interest.\n\nA: There could be multiple reasons for this happening, will explain my scenario.\nProblem (Xcode-Beta):\n\n\n*\n\n*I had Xcode and Xcode-beta installed, I deleted Xcode-beta before tapping on Update on the App Store\n\n*Xcode was waiting to install for over 10 min, restart of the Mac didn't help.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Launchpad and noticed a completely separate app (without an app icon) waiting to install. On the Launchpad, press and hold till the icons wiggle, delete the app that didn't have an icon.\n\n*Go to AppStore and try installing\n\n\nI understand that this was a specific case, just stating in case somebody faced a similar issue.\n\nA: This worked perfectly for another App Store download stuck in \"waiting\".  I quit the App Store, opened Terminal, pasted in code from Sheharyar's post above to clear cache, and pressed Enter.  Restarted App Store and was able to begin my download immediately. \n", "Q: What's a good graphics card for Yosemite on a Mac Pro 1,1? I'd like to upgrade my Mac Pro 1,1 (using the EFI workaround hack) to run Yosemite so all my Macs are running the same version of OS X.\nThis old box is only used as an HTPC, so smooth 1080P video playback and good UI response is all I need -- I don't game or do anything serious on it.\nCan anyone recommend an inexpensive card? Or barring a specific card, anything I should avoid or look for in a card so it plays nice with Yosemite?\nI'm currently running 10.7.5, so ideally I'd like a card that has no trouble with that version as well.\nI'm leaning toward an XFX HD 6670 (link below), since I hear it works OOTB on these boxes with Lion, but I have no information about whether it works well with the final version of Yosemite.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/XFX-650MHz-PCI-Express-Graphics-HD667XCLF3/dp/B00AHV7NNE/ref=cm_cd_ql_qh_dp_t\n\nA: I ended up going with the aforementioned card (the \"XFX HD 6670 650MHz 2GB DDR3/HDMI/DVI/VGA PCI-Express Graphics Card HD667XCLF3\") and it worked brilliantly in both Lion and Yosemite.\nI've only been using the DVI output, not HDMI, so I can't say anything for sure about the HDMI output.\n", "Q: How can I share or send a radio program I've recorded from the Tune in radio app on my iPhone 5s? I recorded an AM radio interview via the Tune In radio app on my iPhone 5S.  I would like to share the recorded program by sending the link, if there is one, to someone else by email or text.  Is this possible?\n\nA: Your supposed to be able to share recordings via their app but I think there is bug that prevents that from happening. I have the TuneIn Radio Pro app and recorded a bit of a station. Then I tried to share it by clicking on my recording and then tapping the little share button (the only options it gives are send via email, text message or G+) and it gave me a url like this: recording://1414797133.74747 I was unable to open this link when shared to friends with the app, or even open it myself. This was tested with version 6.5 of their app.\n\nA: the best way to do it, is by first record the program in your computer using a program like cool edit pro  or Adobe.. after you have it as mp3 then u can share it.. \notherwise you will be sharing the tune in pro app only\n", "Q: Panic Coda 2.5.1 SFTP No longer connects \"Could not connect to server _____.

Why can't the Continuity feature use only wifi, or even only the Internet? As I understand it requires Bluetooth 4.0 and doesn't work without it. Why? Is it for communication between OS X and iOS? If so, why it's not using other available communication channels, such as wifi or the Internet?\nIf it is because of security reasons, I don't understand how Bluetooth is more secure than SSL, for example. Or there are some other reasons for requiring Bluetooth?\n\nA: Features like Handoff and instant hotspot need a reliable way to tell when the devices are close to each other.  Being on the same network doesn't really mean anything and determining distance from Wi-Fi signal strength is very iffy.\nBT 4.0 has a proximity profile that allows devices to tell when they are near each other and even how far.  Furthermore it does that by sending and receiving very small packets to broadcast and read the devices characteristics.\nTo further clarify, Handoff and Instant Hotspot use BT to allow the devices to sense each other's proximity, but the actual document and data communications are over TCP/IP.  Here's a discussion on why that is:\nhttp://www.dslreports.com/forum/r29619197-Yosemite-maximum-distance-for-continuity-\nAnd here is a conceptual explanation (from an iOS dev point of view) of how Handoff works:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Handoff/HandoffFundamentals/HandoffFundamentals.html#\nThis is where BT comes in:\n\"Handoff passes only enough information between the devices to describe the activity itself, while larger-scale data synchronization is handled through iCloud.\"\n", "Q: iPad 1 won't boot, flashes apple logo I have recently acquired a refurbished iPad 1 WiFi + 3G. Straight out of the box it wouldn't boot up at all. No logo, or anything.\nUpon plugging the device into the AC power charger, the Apple logo blinks on and off every 5-10 seconds.\nWhen connected to a PC or Mac via USB, the Apple logo does not appear however, you can see the backlight lighting up & turning off every 2-3 seconds.\nI can set it into DFU mode when connected to iTunes, and iTunes detects the device and offers Restore mode (to iOS 5 - iPad1,1_5.1.1_9B206_Restore.ipsw), which I have already downloaded from the official Apple IPSW repo. \nAfter selecting the IPSW and initiating the restore, the following happens:\n- Extracting Software -> Progress bar completes quickly\n- Verifying iPad restore with apple -> Progress bar completes quickly\n- Preparing iPad for restore -> Progress bar completes quickly\n- Verifying iPad restore with apple -> Progress bar completes quickly\n\nAt some point in this process, I hear the \"USB disconnected\" sound. \nIt's at this point that I figure things have failed out.\n\n- Verifying iPad restore with apple -> Progress bar sits at 0% for more than 4 minutes then shows the following error: \"The iPad \"iPad\" could not be restored. An unknown error occured (1602)\"\n\nThings I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different USB cables\n\n*Disonnected all other USB cables\n\n*Tried different USB ports\n\n*Attempted restore a bunch of times\n\n*Uninstalled AV and Firewall software\n\n*Made sure no other phone software was installed\n\n\nNo dice.\nI've also played the game where you hit the sleep and home buttons the minute the logo comes up to reboot the device every 5 seconds - for over 15 minutes, but that hasn't extended the boot cycle in the least.\nOh yeah, I've also tried freezing the wretched thing to get maximum performance out of the (presumably) completely discharged battery.\nI'm out of ideas. Anyone else?\n\nA: Cannot comment yet so I will use the answer box (apologies) - the battery isn't flat if the Apple logo is flashing (requires power to do this). If an iPad has a flat battery for a prolonged period, then refuses to boot when the power cable is in, leave it connected to power for 48 hours+ The batteries on early models are slow to recharge if fully flat, and this is a known recovery process. \nYour actual condition and circumstances (potentially dodgy seller) sounds like they are hardware related, and it could be that someone has opened the iPad to circumvent the Apple ID or replace the battery and made a mess of it. If you are feeling brave my next steps would be to remove the screen (replace with a new one) and replace the battery then check all wiring, solder and connections. The parts are cheap on eBay and the issue might be obvious once the device is opened up. \n", "Q: Is there open source or free software to use my touchpad as absolute touch? I'm running OS X Yosemite, and don't want to spend money on a Wacom tablet. Is there free software or code that can disable the acceleration of the touchpad so I can write effectively with a stylus?\n\nA: I just found a app called Inklet.\nI did not try it my self, but will consider it for any pen drawing work where the use of mouse or trackpad is difficult.\nIt does cost $20, but it might be worth, but there is a free demo version to try first.\n", "Q: What is a normal cpu temperature for a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011)? Problem with temperature on this mac:\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011)MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011)\n2.4 GHz Intel Core i5\n16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nIntel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\n\nNow I have temperature about 80-100C in 90% of time (without load temperature about 65-70C). I think maybe problem with thermal paste and heatsink.\nBefore I install Yosemite 10.10 temperature was aroud 60-70 (except youtube videos or some heavy work like video editing and similar).\nI tried to disable coherence, reset smc and nvram but without any changes, temperature high even on simple tasks like browsing or work in simpe apps like text editor.\nHow can I try to prevent overheating or it's a normal temperature for this types of cpu/macbooks?\nCooler works, system show from 4000 to 6200 rpm (that is noisy).\nPS. After some observation found that WindowServer with enabled transparency load up to 60% of cpu (and sometimes more), without transparency about 12-40%. So I guess maybe WindowsServer main problem.\n\nA: I do not know if iStat works well with Yosemite and delivering correct results.\nYour CPU temp is on very high end indicating full load of CPU = continuous load of >100%.\nYour SMC reset might not have worked so try it again.\nIntel made a simple tool that correctly reports CPU load.\nA 2011 model should not have a Thermal paste issue, those usually occur after 5 Years (if), and when the conductive paste dries up. \nBut if you consider doing something about it, it is in the difficult category to do it your self.\nIntel Power Gadget.\n\nA: I have the same exact computer with the same problem. I turned on the activity monitor and found that Google Drive was sucking up a TON of CPU. I really don't know why since I  having done anything with my Google Drive in weeks. I quit Google Drive and immediately my CPU usage dropped significantly. The CPU temp also dropped from 185°f at rest to 128°F at rest. The fans have slowed way down too.

In order to avoid second-hand Mac issues relating to iCloud remote shut downs, I have performed the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure erase (using parted magic), deleted old partition and created a new partition (using gparted).\n\n*Cleared PRAM/NVRAM using keyboard procedure a few times, after HD was already wiped.\n\n*Installed Ubuntu (I will be using Ubuntu, and maybe Windows through VB).\nIs there any way that Find My Mac capabilities could have persisted, and would it be able to shut me down if I connect the MacBook to the internet and the seller (or sellers seller) decides to lock the device on iCloud?.\nThe device does not currently have any type of lock, nor did it have it when I received it, as I was able to plug in a USB and boot parted magic. A quick inquiry: I would be able to tell for sure if the device is FMM locked when I connect to the internet, correct? If FMM capabilities are still in order, the laptop would be tracked/locked (if so was the command), even if it was running Ubuntu?\n\nA: There is a simple way to find out who is the owner of the computer as reported to Find my Mac.\nIn terminal use\nnvram -p | grep fmm\n\nIf it is your name there then you are fine.\n", "Q: Test application for Retina and Non Retina I have a MBP retina 13\" running OSX 10.10. \nI am developing an app for Mac App store.\nSince I am having a retina display, I am not able to test the application for non retina models ?

This would stimulate passive learning of keyboard shortcuts -- and for ones most relevant to the user no less! Keep track of my actions so that I could assign shortcuts to series of actions would really be something.\nWhat aspects of the OS libraries available could a developer use write such software?\nSomething like seeing the shortcut next to the menu item, only when the menu isn't used...  e.g. something that would flash \"Command + L\" each time I click the address bar of a browser, or \"Command + Shift + D\" each time I clicked \"Send\" on a mail message.\n\nA: Menu items contain shortcut information\nMightbe a bit obvious, but most of the menu items contain shortcut information. And if no shortcut is visible for a specific menu item, it is most certain that none is available.\nWhen you use a menu item, do not click, but use the shortcut instead. \nYou can also create you own shortcuts, but that is something different. \n", "Q: Force OS X to open .tex files with TexShop I would like the .tex files to be opened using TexShop by default.

I can do it manually, but don't want to do it every single time I boot the computer.\nI couldn't find any related options in \"Preferences -> Displays\".\nAny ideas how can I fix this?\n\nA: I am having the same issue and I believe it's a system bug (10.10.1) without any good workarounds.  Even if you have no extra spaces on your secondary display, an extra space will show up on your main display on every reboot.  \nI will summarize for you the various approaches I've tried and the results of each.  Only the first one solved it totally for me, but it's not ideal as you have to get used to making your secondary display into the new primary display.\n(My two displays are different sizes which limits the ways it can be solved.)\n\n\n*\n\n*If your secondary display is being seen by your Mac as \"primary\" (does the boot screen Apple logo first appear here?), then you can use Display preferences, under Arrangement, to move the menubar to your secondary display.  I tried it and it fixes the issue, but now everything defaults to the secondary display.  You will constantly see new notifications, new windows, etc. popping up on the secondary display.  Not ideal but it solved the issue of spaces being pushed over to the main display after every reboot.\n\n*If your secondary display is being seen by your Mac as \"primary\" (does the boot screen Apple logo first appear here?), then maybe you can swap the ports where these displays are plugged in.  I purchased the adapters in order to do this, but it was a total failure for me.  No matter where I plugged in my smaller display, the Mac picked this for the boot screen every time.  I even trashed all display preferences and zapped the PRAM to start fresh... no matter what I tried, the smaller secondary display booted as the primary.  Unless you've set the menubar on this same display in preferences, the bug you're reporting will remain.\n\n*On the Apple forum, several users have reported that turning off auto-login solved it entirely.  This trick also failed for me.  The boot process looked nicer as you no longer had to look at desktop pictures shifting around and re-sizing, but after logging in, the root problem of spaces shifting over to one display remained.\n\n*Turn off the \"displays have separate spaces\" item in the Mission Control preferences.  Not a practical solution.  This is like killing the patient to cure the disease.  Clearly there is a bug when using separate spaces that urgently needs to be addressed.\n\n*If your two displays are the same size and you don't care which one is primary, then whichever display contains the Apple logo on boot will become your primary display.  Use Display preferences, under Arrangement, to move the menubar to your this display.  Then physically arrange them on your actual computer desk to your liking.  This is the only perfect solution, but obviously works only when you don't care which physical display is set as the primary.\n\nEDIT:\nSince posting this answer, I submitted this bug to Apple using my Apple developer account on December 18, 2014.  The current status of my bug report (19299246) is \"open\".  I will update this answer as I track the bug with Apple.\n\nA: Open displays in Sys Pref. Drag JUST THE MENU BAR icon in the top of the primary display from one display to the other. Leave the displays as they are otherwise. Poof. Done.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it the following way:\nIn settings->mission control, you'll find an option called \"displays have separate spaces\". That was ticked bt default and when I unticked it (*) I at least had multiple spaces on my secondary screen. Maybe not the solution you were looking for, but for me multiple desktops on my secondary screen is pivotal, and now I can work again\n(*)Note that it requires that you log out and then in again.\n\nA: Sparky's suggestion #2, swapping the ports that the displays connect to, resolved this problem for me.\nI'm using a 2013 Mac Pro 6,1 with two displays plugged into the bottom pair of Thunderbolt ports that share the same bus. No matter what else I change the monitor that's plugged into the port on the right – nearest the power button – becomes the primary monitor.\n", "Q: Transfer Clash of Clans village to another iPhone I will soon buy a new iPhone. If I log in with my Apple ID in my new phone could I still access my Clash of Clans village without starting from scratch?\n\nA: You'll want to use iTunes or iCloud to which to back up your iPhone prior to replacing it. For example, if you backup to iTunes and enable encryption, all your data and passwords will be covered as well as your apps. When you get the new phone, you would then immediately connect it to your system and use iTunes to restore your data to the new phone from backup.\nAs long as your backup and restore do not have any CoC action in between, your level information should transfer at par.\n\nA: Providing you are signed in to Game Center on both devices, your progress will transfer automatically.\n", "Q: Add new currency to Yosemite Spotlight Is it possible to add new currency to the spotlight currency conversion?\nI'd like to have UAH (Ukrainian Hryvna) in my spotlight.\n\nA: No, this is currently not possible.

How can I keep HDMI playing movies while using other apps on my handset?\nI initially thought that the adapter merely mirrored pixel-for-pixel, but during movie playback it is possible to reveal the double-tap application menu without affecting playback; selecting an app results on its being displayed on both displays and halting movie playback.\niOS 7.1.2, Apple Lightning-to-HDMI adapter, HDTV, Netflix app.\nI would prefer a factory setting or approved app to achieve this, but please do include jb solution if applicable.\n\nA: Lock the phone, swipe to the left then back.

My friend deleted some hidden files on his Mac (OS X 10.9.4) laptop.\nAfter restarting his laptop the Mac just shows loading progress bar and nothing else.\nHow can we restore the hidden files and get the computer working again?\n\nA: They're hidden for a reason, & that reason is because you shouldn't go anywhere near them if you don't know what you're doing.\nTo repair the installation…\nAt Boot, hold  Cmd ⌘    R  & go to Recovery, or Internet Recovery if that doesn't work.\nSee About OS X Recovery\nExtract:\nOS X Recovery includes a built in set of utilities as part of the Recovery System.\nYou can use OS X Recovery to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore your Mac from a Time Machine backup.\n\n*Verify and repair connected drives using Disk Utility.\n\n*Check your Internet connection or get help online using Safari.\n\n*Install or reinstall OS X.\n\n\nI would suggest you should attempt in that order, probably ignoring 'verify & repair' as you know exactly why the files are no longer there.\nTo recover invisible files from Time Machine, you would first need to set the Finder to 'show invisibles' which can be done from Terminal or by Applescript - though I'm not certain how you would do that from the recovery startup.\nFailing that, the only option would be to reinstall OS X, either from the Recovery partition or via Internet Recovery - this will replace only the System files, your data will not be affected.\n\nA: I did the same while trying to back up my files. I accidentally erased all files as I thought I was only deleting \"my files\" after copying them on my external drive. I tried the Cmd+R but it didn't work.\nI tried restarting with the OS X installation CD, then it booted normally.

I have often wondered why Apache is installed on my Macbook. I have been working with web development for several years and often wondered; why does Apple install Apache on a Macbook.\nRecently I have run into several issues with setting up an Apache based local development environment, and I would like to know if I can replace Apache entirely, or is my Macbook Pro relying on it being installed?\n\nA: You can install other web server software like, for example, nginx using brew.\nPersonally I would just turn Apache off, I wouldn't try to remove it. Off the top of my head I can't think of any places where the OS depends on it being there, but given that it is installed as part of the OS, if you remove it there is a good chance that a future software update will just reinstate it.\n\nA: Actually there is one thing (that I know of) that relies on the built in Apache server. That would be the built-in web interface to CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, that lies at the heart of the Mac printing subsystem.\nHonestly most people don't know it's there and even fewer have ever done anything with it. Go to locahhost:631 in Safari and you will either get this error \"The web interface is currently disabled. Run \"cupsctl WebInterface=yes\" to enable it.\" or you'll get the CUPS web interface.\nBut Alistair is correct, don't remove it, there may be other dependencies. But you can install other versions of Apache or Nginx or whatever you like side by side with the shipping Apache version with no problems.\nIn Yosemite and I think Mavericks too Apache is turned off by default and you have to start it from shell commands, if you need a general purpose web server, as the GUI switches have been removed from the Sharing preferences panel.\n", "Q: Bluetooth and WiFi interfering with one another since Yosemite Note: The only thing that changed in my setup is installing Yosemite.\nSince installing Yosemite, I'm having a somewhat peculiar problem: WiFi works fine, and BT works fine. But WiFi + BT working together at the same time is a different story. \nI first noticed this yesterday. Two things happen, and the second is more prevalent:\n\n\n*\n\n*I was using Apple's Magic Mouse + wireless keyboard, and began downloading a large file. Once this happened, mouse movement began being really slow, as if I'm trying to move the mouse on a very uneven surface. Pausing the download would bring the mouse's movement back to normal.\n\n*But then something else started happening: Turning BT on would effectively kill my internet connection. From the moment I turn on BT and start using mouse & keyboard, my download speed would go quickly from 1.3MB/s to 500B/s (yes, Bytes), and die slowly from there. When this happens, my mouse movement is just fine. Upon turning BT off, download speed shoots back up to 1.3MB/s.\nSo to me it seems like BT and WiFi are \"competing\" with each other, like they're sharing the \"same lane\" when they shouldn't. Either the normal WiFi speeds will make my mouse move really slowly, or, if my BT is working fine, then my WiFi download speeds will be abysmal. This seems to only happen (or be noticeable) when I'm downloading something like a big file.\nI've tried many solutions — PRAM, hardware tests, etc..nothing seems to have helped.\nWTH?\nNote: This question isn't about the (seemingly more common) WiFi dropping issues, please don't hijack it.\nUpdate 1: There seem to be more people having this issue.\nUpdate 2: Problem persists even after updating to OS X 10.10.1.\nUpdate 3: Over 5 months later, and Apple still haven't fixed this.\nUpdate 4: (29/10/15) One year later (on the latest OS X El Capitan), and my rMBP is still suffering from this issue. Work perfectly on their own, but together they get very challenging. For those who suggested to just get a 5GHz router — I appreciate your responses. However, I don't think I should be obligated to buy a new router just because Apple messed up their software. This is no fix for the underlying issue that is clearly still there for many people. The answer selected as \"correct\" was auto selected since this was a bounty quesiton.\n\nA: Most likely the introduction of Continuity in Yosemite increases the demand for wireless bandwidth and that impinges upon the already crowded 2.4GHz band shared between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Many pieces of evidence support this theory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth and Wi-Fi interference only came to the fore after the introduction of Yosemite so it can't be just due to the fact that they share the same frequency band (otherwise Mavericks would suffer from the same problem on a wide scale).\n\n*The more Bluetooth devices that one has the more likely that one's Wi-Fi connection would deteriorate or even get dropped completely.\n\n*The presence of any Bluetooth device that requires a large bandwidth and constant connection, e.g. Bluetooth speakers, almost always incurs interference.\n\n*Removing Bluetooth PAN from one's network or terminating AirDrop service work for some (most likely those with very few Bluetooth devices) albeit for a short period of time suggests that congestion is a culprit.\n\n*Finally, those who use routers with dual-band support, e.g. one from the latest AirPort lineup, don't seem to suffer from this problem.\nI also suspect that people who suffer from this type of interference the most are those who have devices that can only support up to 802.11b/g on their network, e.g. a pre-2009 PC or Mac.\nDespite the instability of discoveryd, Apple kept it for three updates before finally removing it on the fourth. Apple must've felt the need for a new network service that can both accommodate the augmented bandwidth requirement of Continuity and the security demand that it wants to meet.\nUpdate: Restricting my Airport Express (1st gen) to 5 GHz has made the problem go away completely and my Wi-Fi speed has jumped an incredible three-fold.\n\nA: Open the Terminal app (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal), paste the following code, press Enter and type your admin password when prompted.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.bt.plist bluetoothCoexMgmt Hybrid\n\nThen reboot. This worked for me on macOS Catalina 10.15.1\nCredit 1, 2\nBTW, you may find some sites saying to turn off Handoff. I tried that. It didn't help.\n\nA: Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11/b/g/n (WIFI) use almost the same frequency bands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth: 2.402 - 2.480 GHz (79 channels)  \n\n*WIFI 2.4 GHz (IEEE 802.11/b/g/n): 2.4 – 2.4835 GHz (11, 13 or 14 channels depending on the country)\n\n\nUsually Bluetooth uses frequency hopping and changes the possible 79 x 1 MHz bands 1600 times a second to avoid disturbances while WIFI uses fixed channels.\nObviously something went wrong developing the latest Bluetooth- or WIFI-drivers.\nThe only workaround until Apple gets their drivers fixed is using dual band wireless access points. Those devices use two different frequency bands:\n2.4 – 2.4835 GHz and 5.18 - 5.825 GHz (with some gaps).\nConnecting to WIFI 5 GHz (IEEE 802.11a/h/n) will not interfere with Bluetooth.\nAlmost all Macs sold since 2006 support 802.11 a/b/g/n.\nApple's answer: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Potential sources of wireless interference\nBTW: Not only typical RF-based devices (like wireless phones, etc) but also bad-shielded USB3-devices and cables interfere with WIFI (2.4 GHz) and Bluetooth.\n\nA: IMO - the true fix for this is to get your WiFi network off 2.4 GHz when it's not reliable.\nI put together a bit of a guide on how to know if you have to spend the $$ to get a better frequency, and the tools/books are about $20 each.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get off 2.4 GHz - use 5 GHz as it's far less susceptible to interferance and channel overlap.\n\n*If you are on 2.4 - get a tool like WiFi Explorer to make sure you have a viable environment to have a reliable experience.\n\n*If you want to learn more and have limited time to piece things together from internet volunteers, this take control book by Glenn Fleishman is excellent.\n\n\nSee Yosemite keeps dropping WiFI connectivity for more details on how to diagnose an interference issue between BT and WiFi on 2.4 GHz\n\nA: While still not perfect, removing the Bluetooth PAN device (even if its not connected at all) from the network devices helped me greatly.\n\nA: In my case, I figured that I was using wireless mouse with one of those dongles (and it turns out that it operates on 2.4 GHz frequency just as WiFi and BT). So, it was really not the BT and WiFi interfering, but that stupid dongle-d mouse!\nHTH\n\nA: For visitor who are using BootCamp and encounter this question while searching for a solution, this worked for me on MBP 2017 with Microsoft Designer Set (Mouse and Keyboard)\nDevice Manager > Network Adapters > Broadcom 802.11ac Network Adapter > Right click and Select Properties > Advanced Tab > Bluetooth Collaboration > Disable\n", "Q: Importing a shared photo stream into iPhoto creates duplicate photos I have a shared photo stream in iCloud with a couple thousand pictures. (This is not My Photo Stream, but a stream I created separately.) About half the pictures were shared by me and the other half were shared by my wife. I wanted to import my wife's photos into my iPhoto, so I right-clicked on the iCloud album in iPhoto and clicked \"Import\". This imported all the photos into a new event in iPhoto. It imported all of my wife's photos, but it also created duplicate copies of the photos that I had already shared and were still in my iPhoto library. The photos imported from the photo stream have a lower resolution and file size than the original photos in my library.\nMy questions are: \n(1) How can I automatically get rid of these duplicate photos? I tried one tool called \"Duplicate Photo Cleaner For iPhoto\", but it didn't recognize them as duplicates probably because the file sizes and resolutions are different.\n(2) What should I have done instead to import my wife's shared photos without duplicating my own?\n\nA: to provide an answer to this old question, as it's still good info to have...\n1) The best way at the time to delete the photos would have been to view the Last Imported photos and delete them from there.   Not just deleting the duplicates, but deleting all of the photos (basically to reverse the import that was done).\n2) What should have been done to import the photos from your wife's phone in to your library is to connect her phone to your computer, and import them from the phone itself, rather than the stream.   This way, you are getting the original photos, not the compressed / lower quality versions from the photo stream.\n\nA: I don't know about the app you tried to get rid of the duplicates, but I've used Duplicate Photos Fixer, it has lots of options for filtering what images it considers duplicates, and its been really useful. I hope it works fine for you too.\n", "Q: What's the best way to display (and print) rtf files My son gets his homework assignments online as rtf files. On his Macbook, they are automatically opened with textedit which won't display graphics and other elements correctly or at all. So, he will need to convert to pdf (or open with another app). What's the best and most MACcy way to do that?\n\nA: I found some background to this - Why cannot Pages show pictures in .rtf files?\nthat Apple decided not to support pictures in rtf because of limitations in the format, but instead to opt to use rtfd format which supports them much better.\nThe 'fix' would appear to be [without investing in Microsoft Word] to use NeoOffice or OpenOffice, both of which support embedded pictures in rtf files.\n\nA: I believe you can also display pictures in RTF files in the much lighter weight Bean which is actually based on TextEdit.\n\nA: The best way to deal with .rtf files in this way is use Microsoft Word as that is really what the provider expects. \nIf you don't want to pay Microsoft then use OpenOffice software e.g. LibreOffice OpenOffice NeoOffice which emulate Office\nrtf has never had an official standard it is usually try to work out what Microsoft actually did.\n", "Q: Why does my Apple TV cause wifi to drop on my MacBook? As soon as I attempt to connect my MacBook Pro to my Apple TV (in extended desktop or mirrored mode) my Macbook loses its wifi connection. Sometimes it will attempt to reconnect to the network, sometimes it won't. Even if it succeeds in reconnecting it will very soon drop again.\nI have not been able to test whether using a wired connection on either the Apple TV or MacBook makes any difference yet but can try to give it a go if it's likely to make any difference.\nThe MacBook is late 2013 and is running Yosemite (but this was already a problem under Mavericks). The Apple TV is running 7.0.1, which I believe is the latest version.\nI've tried resetting the SMC on the MacBook which appears to be the recommended solution to all sorts of Yosemite connectivity issues but that made no difference. What could be causing this, and what can I do to resolve it?\n\nA: A few suggestions were made in this thread, which could play into it:\n1) Check the device (Apple TV) to see if it is under a warranty replacement program\n2) Try adjusting the settings on your WiFi router for the broadcast channels. Setting the device to 40MHz only instead of 20/40MHz auto might help alleviate.\n3) Try changing the wireless encryption from WPA to WPA2 or vice versa. There may be an issue with how the devices interact with the authentication.\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad lock screen as a digital message board I use my iPhone/iPad screens as digital message board. A bit like digital message boards you might see in airports, doctors waiting rooms or train stations.\nMy current strategy is to open a photo editing app on my iPhone, write a message, save a jpeg in the photos app, sync the photo across my iPhone/iPad and then assign the photo as wallpaper for the lock screen.\nBut I'm wondering if there is an app which I can display messages as wallpaper in the lock screen and sync across iOS devices?\n\nA: Currently, apps cannot change the wallpaper as you describe. I do not believe it's possible for wallpaper to be synced between devices, either. (You can sync the photos being used, but I don't believe you can sync the choice of wallpaper.)\n", "Q: Why does OS X show a forgot password prompt when trying to boot or wakeup screen? Something came up today that bugged me a bit, I left my laptop on battery power before going to bed. When starting it up the battery was dead. I plugged it in, and here is what happened:\nThe startup progress bar came up for a while and then a forgot password prompt came up, with questions like:\n\"set a new password\"\n+ 2 other options that I can't remember (they weren't relevant)\nand a previous and next arrows.\nPuzzled, I hit previous and the dialog froze. I proceeded to restart again and ended up on the same dialog, I reset my password to the same as my previous and that was it.\nAny idea what might have happened?\n\nA: Brian's answer was right on. The issue in my case was related to the backlight. Here's how I got around it:\n\n\n*\n\n*While the password dialog is up, move your mouse cursor to the top of the screen until you get an apple menu.\n\n*Select \"Restart\" from the Apple menu\n\n*Use a flashlight to shine a light through the Apple on the back of your MacBook screen and you should see that the computer is on, but the backlight is not. \n\n*Use the right and left arrow keys to toggle between accounts and hit enter to login on the one you want, using the flashlight to see what you are doing.\n\n*Once logged in, the backlight should function normally.\n\n\nI have not determined the root cause yet.\n\nA: \nAlthough I didn't run out of battery power, I had the same issue this\n  morning on my 15-inch, Mid 2012 MacBook Pro running Yosemite final.\n  This was not the same laptop I used for the beta which was upgraded to\n  final yesterday and has not yet failed.\n\nDiscovered the problem. The system was prompting for my FileVault password but with the screen backlight off. It appears that by pressing the enter key repeatedly in an attempt to get the system to respond the startup password reset mode was launched.\nI ran into the issue last night at 95% battery life remaining when I performed a hard power reset while logged in after the lock screen became unresponsive. I thought I was seeing persistence on the LCD under the lighting conditions I was working with last night and experimentally tried pressing right arrow to select the \"Guest\" account.\nThis is similar to MacBook display backlight doesn't turn on after waking from sleep with the exception that logging in does reactivate the backlight/display.\nResetting the PRAM and SMC did not resolve the issue and as I did not experience the problem prior to upgrading to Yosemite I believe it's a software, rather than a hardware issue. For the moment I can only recommend adjusting the angle of the display under lighting to see if the password prompt is displayed and logging in to unlock FileVault.\n\nUPDATE: I've gotten my hands on an Early 2013 15\" Retina Macbook Pro and\n  performed a full restore from backup. I haven't seen the issue on this\n  laptop, nor have I seen the issue on my Late 2010 11\" Macbook Air. This appears to\n  be affecting only specific hardware.\n\n\nA: This happened to me this morning. My laptop went to sleep, on full battery, and when I returned home after work, the system had to boot up and I got the same \"reset password\" prompt. However, in my circumstance, I believe my younger brother was trying to get into my macbook and probably locked himself out and this is the OS's security response. Perhaps that is what happened and someone was trying to get into yours as well?\n\nA: What helped for me (without knowing about the flashlight trick) was to reset the  PRAM and NVRAM.\nFirst of all make sure that your Mac is off, by pressing the Caps Lock key and making sure the light doesn't come on. If it does, hold the power button for a few seconds until it's off.\nOnce you're sure it's off, press the power button to turn it back on, then immediately press command+option+p+r together until you hear a second boot chime.\nNow the backlight setting should be back to default and your Mac will show the login screen.\nSource: https://andschwa.com/post/skip-reset-password-for-os-x/\n\nA: This has nothing to do with backlight.\nI've had the same issue on my iMac. I actually found out that it was the guest account having problems login in (no idea why). Upon selecting \"my password is not working with my keyboard\" and inputing the guest account pw, it unlocked/decrypted my iMac.\nSo if you have a guest account, try this out.\n", "Q: Yosemite won't boot any more after attempting to enable FileVault and TRIM I installed Yosemite yesterday and it was working fine.\nNow whenever it tries to boot it runs Safe Mode and fails 1/3 of the way through.\nFrom what I can remember I went to enable FileVault and backed out of it as I didn't enter my correct iCloud information, and didn't want to go down the key generation route.\nI also tried to enable TRIM.\nThis morning I restarted my machine after installing Kies and it wouldn't boot.

This has never happened in any previous OS X that I have used. I have a Early 2013 Macbook Pro with Retina display 13 and I updated to Yosemite a day after it launched. I usually do not shut down my laptop and just keep it in sleep. After the update, sometimes when the laptop wakes up from sleep WiFi is completely switched off. On trying to turn it on I get the following message in console:\n22/10/14 1:41:11.000 pm kernel[0]: ARPT: 1911.087562: wl0: _wlc_ioctl: dead chip, off[0] bar0[0xffffffff]\n\nUpon restart the WiFI icon becomes a grey icon with a cross mark and says either \"No hardware installed\" or \"WiFi not configured\".\nThe only solution I have found till now is an SMC reset. But with the frequency of this happening is quite high and is frustrating to always shutdown and do an SMC reset. Is anyone else facing similar issues? And does anyone know of a fix without a restart ?\n\nA: You may have hardware that is on it's way to being really dead.  The temperature of a marginal chip can cause it to be functional sometimes and non-functional other times.  When you resume from sleep, try letting the computer get warm, then try to enable WiFi.  The chip may need to get warm and then work.  This is obviously not a good long term solution but, if it works, it indicates that the chip (or the connection to the board) is flakey.\n\nA: This issue seems to have been fixed in OS X 10.11 El Capitan, like you mentioned in your comment.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade a mid-2010 21.5\" iMac from Yosemite to Snow Leopard? I had Yosemite on my old iMac (21.5\", mid-2010), then decided to try Snow Leopard on it. (It came installed with Lion, but this model did ship with Snow Leopard previously.)\nBasically, I tried doing what's suggested in this thread:\nHow can I downgrade an iMac12,1 from Lion to Snow Leopard?\nI put the iMac into Target Disk Mode, then connected to it with my MacBook running SL. I formatted the iMac HD, then ran the DVD install from my MacBook (an old 13\" black MacBook), using the iMac HD as the target.\nThis is where things went awry.\nI rebooted the MacBook with the Option held down, but Startup Manager would not show me the iMac target disk. My only option was the MacBook HD.\nIs this because the MacBook does not have the right drivers for the iMac?\nI have also tried to install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Combo Update onto the iMac from the MacBook, but that installer will not accept the iMac HD (with the SL install started on it) as a target.\nAny idea how I can complete this install of SL?\n\nA: Your iMac was delivered with 10.6.6 (somewhat later with 10.6.7).\nWhen you have the original (grey) discs that came with it you can use disc 1 to install the Snow Leopard version (not the disc of another machine). Then update it to 10.6.8\n\nA: I had the same question weeks ago and I format the SSD removing Yosemite and reinstall Mavericks via Internet boot.\nIf you install via Internet I guess the computer will download the drivers.\nHave a look at this site: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6604300\n\nA: Your iMac (21.5\", mid-2010) should have been shipped with 10.6.3. The latest 13\" black MacBook was shipped with 10.5.2.\nThe installer DVD from your MacBook will not install Snow Leopard. Additionally your iMac will not work with 10.5.2. It doesn't contain the necessary drivers.\nNormally you should be able to use the original installer DVD shipped with your iMac and then update to 10.6.8.\nAlternatively you may clone your iBook to the (target-mode) iMac drive with Disk Utility, CarbonCopy or SuperDuper!.\n\nA: I'm not that terribly familiar with target disk mode and whether or not you can perform an installation with it, however you should be able to install OS X Snow Leopard just fine if you take the conventional approach of formatting the hard drive OS X currently resides on and installing Snow Leopard with install media.\n", "Q: My SSD Drive has been converted to a Core Storage drive and cannot be erased/reformatted?

You shouldn't be messing around with the Time Machine backup disk except under very rare circumstances.\n", "Q: OSX and Windows Bootcamp give different system information I have a Mac mini late 2012 running the i5 2.5 processor. In the mac system information it has number of cores - 2, however if I boot to Windows 7 on the bootcamp partition the system information shows i5 2.5 with 4 cores.\nIm inclined to assume OS X is going to be more accurate and correct, but does anyone know why this might be showing as different?\n\nA: That is a dual core processor (Ivybridge Core i5 2.5GHz 3210M). I am guessing that Apple's system information is telling you about the physical cores and Windows is including hyper-threading which lets you run two tasks per core. \n", "Q: in single user mode After mounting an exrenal hdd that is formatted as hfs journalled( with help of a post on this website).\nCan a dmg file downloaded from the net be installed to install mac osx on the external usb drive.

Before I upgraded to Yosemite, I used to see the number of unread and total emails in a folder in the title/header bar,  e.g. \nInbox (23) 64 messages\nI no longer see this - is there any way of getting it back?\n\n\nA: It appears to be a bug and has been reported to Apple.\nA discussion on the Apple forums mentions this same problem, OS X Yosemite mail stopped showing total inbox message count:\n\nThis appears to be a bug. It is triggered when you view a smart folder - once you do, the count in the title bar will disappear until you restart mail.\nI filed this as a bug with Apple, so they're aware of it.

To use it, just drag and drop the app you want to remove onto AppCleaners window.\n\nA: someone, not I, might also be able to post the terminal command to find all files associated with an application. AppCleaner is better than some of the others but it too will sometimes leave kernel extensions and daemons etc behind.\n", "Q: Computer name keeps changing OSX 10.10 (14A389) Since I upgraded to Yosemite 10.10 (14A389) my computer name keeps changing adding a (2) and (3) and so forth.\nAny ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: This is a bug in 10.10 (the initial release) and can be fixed by simply upgrading to 10.10.1 - build 14B25. You can still have this happen on later os,  it the big made it happen rapidly and without sleep/wake cycles. \nOpen the App Store and apply the 10.10.1 (or later) update and you should be set once you rename any computers that adopted the (2) names.\nThere still are problems if you have older Apple TV, older computers where they will get renamed and rename themselves, but your computer shouldn't rename itself if it's the only device on the network.\nMy guess is it will take some time for this to die down and involve Airport router changes, Airport and Apple TV updates as well as iOS and Apple updates. In a household with 20 or so devices, not all can be updated to the latest.\nThe root cause of this is two-fold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computers with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses literally can be contacted in two ways and bonjour/mDNS/discoveryd isn't handling this duality well yet.\n\n*Computers that sleep or lose contact with the DHCP server (usually your router) can have their old address proxied or cached - which currently is handled by adding (2) or incrementing the value in (x) by one if the proxied/cached address hasn't timed out when you reconnect to the network or wake the device from sleep.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist with Xcode.\n\n*Add a string to the ProgramArguments array containing --no-namechange.\n\n\n*Save and restart.\n\nA: Go to Macintosh HD > Library > Preferences > SystemConfiguration\nand delete the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n*NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*preferences.plist\n\n\nThen reboot the Mac.\nThe host names should be recreated correctly.\n(According to http://forums.imore.com/os-x-yosemite-10-10/304804-my-computer-name-changing-10-10-a.html these are instructions provided by an Apple tech.)\n\nA: The Scagg's method fixed this for me. It was only a problem when Time Machine failed to find the backup server on our network due to this annoying name change. Reverting the name back to the original in System Preferences dealt with the problem immediately. Of course I doubt if this is a permanent fix but it is an easy remedy. Many thanks Scaggs.\n\nA: To be able to achieve this, run the following commands on the terminal:\nsudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :ProgramArguments: string --no-namechange\" /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\n\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\n\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\n\nand \nsudo scutil --set ComputerName <host-name-U-want>\nsudo scutil --set HostName <host-name-U-want>\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName <host-name-U-want>\nhostname -f\n\n\nA: This solved it for me:\nGo to System Preferences -> Energy Saver. Select \"Power Adapter\" and then uncheck \"Wake for network access\". \nEver since I did that a couple of days ago my computer name has stayed the same.\n\nA: I hate to say this but I'm experiencing this as well.\nOne solution I found (not known if it's permanent) is by going to System Preferences in the search bar you can type 'Computer name' and select it and then change it back by erasing the (2) or (3)\n\nA: PlistBuddy is an app to edit plist (preference) files. /usr/libexec is where it is located. The script then uses that app to edit the plist file for the computer name by adding a line that tells it not to change the name.\nPersonally, I'll keep removing the (2) until they fix it. While it's easy to go in and change the plist back, I will inevitably forget and at some point years down the road, it will frustrate me and take hours to diagnose... but that's just me.\n\nA: I don't believe that the problem is local to your computer.  I started noticing this problem with the introduction of iOS 8.  My AppleTv added a (n) after the name.  When I upgraded my MacBook to Yosemite the same happened.\nIf you login to http://iCloud.com and go to Settings you'll find your iOS8 and Yosemite devices listed.  I haven't found a explanation yet, but I'd recommend not using the solutions suggested so far since they may break some features.  Best, John\n\n\nA: If you have AirPort Base Station (Express, Extreme, or Time Capsule), open AirPort Utility and delete all Apple ID entries for Back to My Mac.\nClick Apply to restart the AirPort\nRe-add your Apple ID\nRestart again\nIt should fix it.  The problem lies to AirPort's old settings.\n\nA: A fast solution, non invasive, and probably temporary to this is to run the following in a terminal:\nsudo hostname HOSTNAME.local\n\nThat sets the hostname now. I only see this issue intermittently, and so this is a good enough solution for now. :-)\n\nA: I also have the changing computer name issue.\nSeems to be a OS X 10.10 bug to me.\nThe answer from \"other Rick\" is rather cryptic but looks promising.\nSome explanation of why this works would perhaps have been useful.\nMaybe it will also solve the other issue that I have - location services only work sometimes.\nWhile dealing with a 'senior' Apple advisor today (8th Nov 2014) about my location services issue, I also asked about this issue. The advisor acknowledged it exists and thought it would be fixed in OS X 10.10.1 (currently released to developers).\n\nA: Give this a go, it seems to have worked for me, though it might be completely unrelated:\nBy default, OS X will name your computer with \"[your name] 's Computer\". After deleting the (2), (3), etc for the 10th time, I got annoyed with the 's and deleted it. Once I did that, the name has been stable for weeks.\nMy suspicion is there is some incompatibility somewhere on the network with the 's, and removing it removes the conflict.\n\nA: I had the same issue,when I changed the computer name it would either revert back to the one Yosemite created at installation or it would generate a new one based on the \"Mac Mini\" naming convention.\nI was only able to change the name by changing the DNS lookup ipaddress for my dhcp server.\nAs soon as I hit apply the name I set for the Mac mini was set and remained.\n\nA: sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :ProgramArguments: string --no-namechange\" \\\n         /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist\n\n\nA: bmike's earlier post about the duality of discoveryd led me to disable IPv6 on my wireless connection.\nNow the NETBios name issue for me is fixed.\nI change the name and it saves it successfully.\n", "Q: iPad 2 after iOS 8.1 I just updated my iPad 2 to iOS 8.1 and some bugs were fixed by this upgrade, but a new one has started.  I have Xfinity Home as an App which allows me to monitor my home security cameras through my WiFi.  It worked fine until I put in iOS 8.1.  Now it tries to boot but just briefly flashes the home page and the goes black.  I've tried deleting and reloading the App several times with same results.

I also have a 3rd gen iPad 64GB wifi which I have recently discovered (following update to IOS 8.xxlatest) is unable to work with AIR DROP. I thought about upgrading to the iPad Air 2. Fortunately, I didn't as I now discover that my MBP might not work with Air Drop either.\nI find NO reference on my MBP to \"handoff\". My wireless card is the BCM43xx 1.0. According to another community supplied \"Continuity Tool\", it says I need a new Wireless card.\n Since this is not a 17\" (never seen one), there are NO additional ports to add in a newer wireless card. My wireless in-house network seems to function just fine.\nWhen I click on Air Drop on the side panel, I see my wife's MBP show up. However, I click on it and nothing happens. What am I missing?\nQUESTION: Do I need a newer wireless card for AIR DROP to work. I am running Yosemite. \nAir Drop should work with my two MBPs. Question is, will they?\n\nA: OK, never mind. I just discovered all the old info regarding \"handoff\" is no longer pertinent. All I do is drop a file on the air drop id I see and they get a question pop up asking to save & open, deny or save. Puts it in the download folder. \nHowever, the iPad 3rd gen still does NOT support air drop. Boo hoo. At least, if I get an iPad air 2, it should work with air drop.\n", "Q: Why does my iMac not boot sometimes? My iMac started to have a problem when booting. It begins to boot where you hear the optical drive and Mac sound goes off, but then it gets stuck on a black screen where it's not responsive. After 10 to 20 minutes it might turn on. Most of the time if I unplug the back power cable and wait for the Mac to cool down then plug it in, it starts normally. If I then restart the computer, it goes back to the same problem. Overall, the Mac works well when it's on.\nOne more thing: the iMac also sometimes boots with many white and black lines and dots moving all over the screen, with the Apple logo with the cursor appearing at the right side of the screen  instead of being in the middle. When I put the Mac to sleep, it turns on with a blue screen, but it is not responsive.\n\n\n\nDoes any one know what it might be?\nThe system has 3gb ram running osx 10.9\n\nA: Was the mac shipped with 3gb ram? It is possibly not the reason but advice all the same, apple strongly recommends you run ram in identical pairs or individual modules, so a single 1, 2, 4 etc GB stick or 2 x 1, 2 x 2GB and so on, but not 1 x 1gb and 1 x 2gb.\n", "Q: Why isn't my apple id letting me download songs?

I followed the instructions here for older iTunes but things have apparently changed in iTunes 12.0.1 and iOS 8.1. The drag-dropping and the double-clicking the M4R file do not work anymore. So\nHow can I create a ringtone to appear in iPhone and iTunes ringtone folder for iTunes12 and iOS8?\n\n\nA: I just tested and the process worked correctly in iTunes 12.0.1. However, I did initially encounter an issue when I tried to add a file that had the same name and was the same size as a song already in my iTunes Library.\nHere are the steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*I dragged-and-dropped MyFile.mp3 into iTunes.\n\n*I right-clicked on it and chose \"Create AAC Version\".\n\n*I right-clicked on the AAC version and chose \"Show in Finder\".\n\n*I dragged-and-dropped the AAC version onto my desktop, creating a copy.\n\n*I renamed the file on my desktop to MyFile.m4r.\n\n*I dragged-and-dropped the file back into iTunes. This didn't do anything. However, having read that iTunes sometimes refuses to import files like this, since it thinks they are identical, I removed the AAC version from iTunes.\n\n*I again dragged-and-dropped the m4r version into iTunes, and this time it showed up in the Tones section of the Library correctly.\n", "Q: Saving, Switching between window arrangements?

I've got a SIM from a windows phone for which tethering (internet sharing over wifi) works fine. \nWhen I put the same SIM into my iPad (3rd Gen, iOS 8.1) - it tells me that I need to contact my carrier to enable Tethering. (I have a second SIM for which tethering works just fine on the iPad). \nMy question is: Is it possible for tethering to be SIM-disabled on one device - but work fine on a device from other vendor?\n\nA: Yes, this is entirely possible. Your SIM card number is provisioned by the carrier to include features X, Y and Z based on your rate plan with them. This can include tethering by device type. If you have multiple SIM cards, it is possible they have enabled the feature for one SIM card but disabled it for the other, either by accident or on purpose.\nYou would need to contact your carrier directly to find out if they have disabled it.\n", "Q: Firewall rules ambiguous?

Some green some red.\nBut what about the hundred other apps on my mac? Are they blocked or allowed?\n\nA: The firewall is designed to block incoming connections unless permission is granted (with the exception of certain essential system services and \"sharing\" services, such as File Sharing and Screen Sharing). The first time you use an application and it requests incoming network access, you will be prompted to allow or disallow. It is then added to the list and your decision is noted.\nSee OS X: About the application firewall on Apple's support website.\n", "Q: How do I downgrade from Yosemite 10.10 to Mavericks 10.9?

Since Apple now requires that new TestFlight beta apps go through the beta review process as well before we can send it to external testers, I have been wondering how long  this process will take.\nI have just submitted an app for a beta review. What is the timeframe that I should expect the approval (or denial, for that matter) of the beta app to take?\n\nA: Apple states, on the TestFlight Beta Testing page, that a beta app must comply with the full App Store Review Guidelines in order to be accepted. Based on this, it would be reasonable to expect that the timeframe for review would be about the same.\n(That is, of course, assuming they haven't been inundated with a deluge of beta review requests since the feature just became available a few days ago.)\n\nA: Minimum time it takes is a few hours. Maximum is 3 days (that's what I've experienced). It usually takes longer over the weekends and holidays. In regular days, it usually takes 1 - 1 and a half days. Generally first build of your new version takes longer than the following builds especially if there is a major change. All information written is from experience only. It will differ in your case.\n\nA: Yesterday at 6 pm I uploaded my beta build for review and it's status was waiting for review. This morning the status had changes to \"In review\" but now, 13h later it's still \"In review\". I will update this post if my app build had been approved.\nEDIT: A day later in the morning it was approved. The total proces from uploading to being reviewed took 1 and a half days.\n\nA: I had a beta release approved for TestFlight today in around an hour.\n\nA: We just submitted our first Beta Review request and were approved in 50 minutes. The app is fairly large and complex. It appears that the Apple testing was very minimal.\nEdit to add:\nWe just release a second version for external beta testing and it was instantly approved; no review required.\n\nA: It does seem to be shorter than the full review process on average, and actually -- from personal experience -- it seems to be less than 24 hours (don't count on reviews over a weekend or holiday however).  There is a tool for seeing how long a regular review might take Average App Store Review Times which is based on voluntarily submitted review time data.  Haven't ever seen it take longer than that though.\n\nA: In my experience, it depends on the version of your app as well. Generally, first version takes longer and if you have kept the features more or less same, the next version is quickly approved. We submitted first beta version of our app for review last month. It took one day for Apple to approve first beta release. From that point onwards, all subsequent beta releases were instantly approved. \n", "Q: Mail.app will only sort by Unread I have a weird problem with Mail.app (7.3) on mavericks (10.9.4) where every folder is now set to 'sort by unread' \nI can change the sort order while I'm in the folder, but if I leave, and return to that folder.. it switches back to 'sort by unread' again.\nI can't find any way to change this permanently, and I certainly didn't configure it this way.

Fortunately, I do have most of my actual files and programs saved to my external HDD, but that leads to another problem.\nI use a lot of 3rd party apps to make music, and they are not compatible with 10.10 i.e. Pro Tools etc. I formatted my HDD in an attempt to start over but it keeps reinstalling Yosemite from the Internet.\nI've made several USB boot drives but when they go to load up it just gives me \"international no\" sign (see image below).\nCan someone please help me as my work/life is tied in to my studio. Oh also my external HDD is now all of a sudden read-only NTFS instead of Mac read/write enabled.\n\n\nA: The Booting from USB issue\nOk, so first off. I don't know how you made the bootable USB, but for the sake of consistency in my answer I will give you a method to use: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download Mavericks for the App store. (I checked, it is still there for downloading)\n\n*Plug in the USB drive you want to boot from (has to be 8GB or more)\n\n*Then from the Terminal app run this command: \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\nIt takes a while to complete so go make yourself some coffee and let Mac OS do it's thing. \nNB Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace MyVolume with the name of your USB drive. \n\n*If you have already downloaded Mavericks and backed it up somewhere, you can just copy it back into the Applications folder. It has to be called Install OS X Mavericks.app.\n\n\nTaken from Creating a bootable OS X installer in OS X Mavericks.\nIf you boot your Mac, immediately hold down the ALT key and select the USB as the boot device. This should boot into the Mavericks installer. From there you can run DiskUtilities and partition you OS hard disk and install Mavericks. \n\nThe NTFS issue\nIt sounds like you might have had a 3rd party app like Paragon installed. Mac does not natively allow writing to NTFS.\n\nA: You need to make sure that you are using the correct build for your iMac.\nIn this document: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1159 you can find the exact build for your iMac, then you have to make sure that you are using a 10.9 version after the minimum build your computer requires. \nIn case you have trouble with that, I find that the best way is to \"buy\" mavericks from a similar computer and then create the install disk using Disk Maker: http://liondiskmaker.com/\nAfter that the computer will reboot from this installation disk and you will be able to install 10.9, but you cannot transfer information from your old hard drive, since migration assistant cannot migrate from an older version, so you will need to do the migration manually, which basically is copying folders from your old drive or backup, to your new drive.\nPlease let me know if you have any doubts I did not want to extend myself much and take for granted that you are familiar with many of the procedures.\n\nA: It sounds like your goal here is to get back to a working system running Mavericks rather than Yosemite, so that your apps will run and you can access your documents and get on with your life.\nIf you have a working computer, albeit running Yosemite, you should be able to download an installer for Mavericks (in my case I can get that from my list of purchased apps in the App Store). With that you should be able to do a clean install of Mavericks. Then you can copy across all your backed up files and apps. You might need to reinstall some of the apps, but essentially you should then be where you need to be.\nThen make a bootable clone of your system, using something like SuperDuper.\nThen you can run some checks to find out when your critical apps will be updated to support Yosemite, and schedule an update at a suitable time.\n", "Q: Time Machine seems to think my MacBook Pro is a new backup after Yosemite upgrade I've been regularly backing up my 2011 MacBook Pro using Time Machine with two separate external drives (1Tb at work, 2Tb at home) while running Mavericks. \nToday I upgraded to Yosemite, and Time Machine seems to think I have a brand new computer - the backup on the 1Tb disk failed with \"not enough space\", and the backup at home is currently attempting to back up the entire 350Gb on my computer.\n(Previously with the 1Tb drive, Time Machine would automatically delete old archives when the drive was full.)\nIs this a common problem (ie a bug)? Is there a way to tell Time Machine to continue where the last backup finished, rather than starting a brand new \"branch\"?\n\nA: You may want to check this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/message/27031297\nIt seems that if you backup external drives with Time Machine and you disconnect them at a later point, for instance for a few hours or days, and reconnect them, Time Machine will want to make a full backup of them (even if nothing has changed). That behavior appeared with Yosemite. I have not heard about any solution or workaround (yet).\n\nA: There's some coding in Terminal you can do to remove flags osx or os sierra applies to those TM backups, then retry TM again. You can try repairing the sparsebundle files in recovery mode (backup current iteration in addition to the SB to an HDD to be safe). \n", "Q: Yosemite white-screen crash (with avatar) Recently upgraded to OSX 10.10 on a Mid 2012 MBP (13 inch) - no problem encountered.

I've tested it on my machine, running Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E46). If you can find the bundle ID (in the Info.plist file for the app bundle), you can use this script to force the app to appear in the notifications preferences pane.\n# \"Usernoted\" seems to be the \"user notifications daemon\", so get it's PID.\npid=$(ps aux | grep -i [u]sernoted | awk '{print $2}')\n\n# Find the sqlite3 database that this program has open.

I know that for older Macs it's a bi-band issue (Why doesn't AirDrop work on older network adapters?) but as AirDrop works between Macs, what's changed in AirDrop with iDevices? \n\nA: Your MacBook Pro does not contain the necessary hardware to support AirDrop.\nIn OS X, the feature didn't use Bluetooth, instead using Bonjour and personal area networking over WiFi to discover and transfer files between Macs.\nWhen iOS gained the feature in version 7, it was a completely different implementation, using Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct. That's why it was not previously compatible with the OS X implementation.\nApple has now retrofitted the iOS implementation onto OS X in Yosemite. This in turn requires a chip for Bluetooth v4 and LE support. This chip was not included in MacBook Pros until mid-2012.\nYou may be able to replace the Bluetooth chip in a 2011 MacBook Pro. See this thread on MacRumors. It references Handoff/Continuity but the underlying chip replacement is what is needed to enable AirDrop as well.\n\nAs it turns out the 2011 MacBook Pro can use the same Airport/Bluetooth card as the mid 2012 Macbook pro and its user replaceable so by replacing the 2011 macbook pro Airport/Bluetooth card you should have the ability to use Handoff/continuity.\n\n", "Q: Install Facebook Messenger on iPhone 3Gs running iOS 6.1.6 I reset my iPhone 3Gs but am unable to install Facebook Messenger back on my iPhone as it requires iOS 7.

The formatting was done on Windows and there isn't any issue when I access it through Windows. I have tried the hard drive on 2 MacBooks so far and it doesn't come up on either one of them when I plug it in.

If you plan to use with Mac, format the drive using a cluster size not more than 1024. \nThe problems I have are kind of different with exFat and mostly when the drive is not ejected properly under mac, everytime this happens i have to do a verify/recover step which takes quite a lot of time as mine is also a 1TB drive.\n\nA: I have done this myself with no issues whatsoever, however my only difference is I formatted the drives using Mac, now this might be speculation and I don't Know how much time you have but if you're able to reformat the drive using Mac\n", "Q: Should I defrag my SSD before creating a partition for Boot Camp? I have a 500GB SSD in my MacBook Pro. I have been using my laptop for over three years - and it was migrated using Migration Assistant from a previous laptop that I had been using for five years before that, so there is probably a lot of crud accumulated.\nI have manually cleaned up a lot of space - I have about 390GB free on this hard drive now. \nI want to set up Boot Camp to dual boot into Windows, and will crate a partition as part of that process.\nI know that HFS+ automatically defragments files normally, but only those less than 20mb.\nI also know that SSDs do not need to be defragmented, as there is no performance penalty to fragmentation. I know that the process of defragmentation may in fact be detrimental, since an SSD only has a certain limit of writes in it's usable life, and defragmentation involves reading data for one place on the drive and writing it to another.\nI have a licenced copy of iDefrag from a long time ago when I had spinning platter hard drives and worked with large video files. \nSo, my question is, is there an advantage to defragmenting the drive? To move all data into one part of the drive? As a once-only thing, only in preparation of partitioning the drive?\n\nA: The Boot Camp Assistant will move any file (if any) which may reside in your future Windows partition to a appropriate position in your then shrinked Mac partition before creating unallocated disk space in the repartitioning process.\nTherefore there is absolutely no need to defrag in the forefront.\nPlease read Do partitions on SSDs map to physical addresses?\nOr with other words:\nA SSD works like an Amazon distribution hub:  \n \nand a HD like Walmart:\n\nIf both of them want to sell a new product (let's say windows) Amazon just has to find empty boxes to stack all the different windows. The controller knows where they are. However Walmart has to free up a whole section to present all windows at the same place for the sake of a convenient shopping experience. ;-)\n\nA: The way a hard drive writes data to disk is fundamentally different from how an SSD writes data to memory.\nThough there is a bit of disagreement out there about it being actually bad for the SSD to defrag it, I am one of those that doesn't do it because it might be harmful and honestly defragging a hard drive will not speed up your SSD. Search for defrag and SSD and most of the results will agree...\nHonestly, I have defragged HDs in the past and rarely noticed a difference on my Macs (PCs are another story altogether...) so if I was to advise anyone on defragging their SSDs, I would just say don't bother, it's not worth the time, effort and potential harm to your SSD.\n", "Q: If I have family-sharing do I have to buy everything through it? If my family has family sharing, do I have to use the family credit card for every purchase, or can I buy some things on my own for my personal use and other things through the family sharing?\n\nA: Once you have family sharing turned on all purchases that aren't covered by a store-credit get billed through the shared payment method which is one charge card entered by the \"Family Organizer\" Apple ID.\nQuote from the Apple Support article:\n\nAfter you set up your family, any time a family member initiates a new purchase it will be billed directly to your account unless that family member has gift or store credit.\n\nAs a workaround @bmike recommends purchasing a gift card and/or refilling your iTunes balance so that no purchase ever is made on anything but store credit. \nDiscounted gift cards can be found at Costco and you can also store your iTunes account in iOS wallet app and recharge it at Apple Retail Stores.\n\nA: The entire family’s purchases come from one account. The benefit to this approach is centralized control over purchases. \n\nA: Once you have set up Family Sharing all your applications can be installed by other members of the family.

When this has happened on my desktop LCDs I've used some Vaseline to hide it.  While I know that doesn't actually fix it I am looking for a technique to make this scratch less noticeable.\n\nA: Possible methods depending on the scratch depth.\n1- Fill it - for deep scratches.\nFill it with toothpaste! or professional glass filler.\n\nBelieve it or not, toothpaste can be used to patch some screen\n  scratches. Actual toothpaste, not gel or paste-mouthwash hybrids, must\n  be used. Users should gently massage the paste into the scratch with\n  their fingers using a circular motion. If done properly, the paste\n  should adhere to the scratch and polish it away. Then, use a soft\n  cloth to remove excess paste from the screen. Finally, use glass\n  cleaner or a special screen cleaner to remove any additional residue.\nPetroleum jelly can also be applied in a similar manner, although it\n  may need to be reapplied if a user happens to rub his or her screen\n  and removes it from the scratch.

This has happened twice so far since I've installed Yosemite on my 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. Needless to say, this is very unnerving and reminiscent of malware activity.\nWith help from Google and scouring event logs, I've traced the problem down to a crash in the window server. The crash report can be found here: http://puu.sh/csTor/0012220497.crash\nIs there anything I can do to stop this from happening again?\nUpdate: It seems having a secondary monitor is triggering it. Dell U2412 over HDMI. I also seem to be able to prevent crashing by avoiding the login screen while the monitor is plugged in.\n\nA: A possible cause for this could be invalid profiles generated by F.lux to provide smooth transitioning between GPU modes - here's an overview of what it does with these profiles: https://justgetflux.com/news/2014/10/28/profile.html\nIn my fresh install of El Capitan it had created these invalid profiles: \nColorSync Utility can be used to verify, remove and/or repair these profiles, or the flux profile switching can be completely disabled with:\ndefaults write org.herf.Flux disableProfile 1\n\nFollowed by removing the profiles.\n\nA: This is a known Bug with Apple. I reported a similar problem in their bugtracker, which was closed as a duplicate of bug #18234875. \nSadly, those bugs cannot be viewed or tracked, apart by the reporter. However, it means that Apple knows about the problem and will hopefully fix it in one of the next OS X updates.\n\nA: There is no point in trying the vague 'catch all' solutions like wiping NVRAM and system controllers. The problem you are having is a SIGSEGV, or, a segmentation fault in WindowServer. It is likely due to corrupt identifiers. Those identifiers are stored in multiple places, and if enough get corrupt, you get crashes. While some identifiers are stored in the NVRAM (or PRAM), wiping this usually only postpones the next crash since the identifier eventually ends up in there again.\nIf WindowServer crashes, all GUI applications stop and it restarts via launchd. When WindowServer starts, it first gives you the login window. So in fact, you are not getting logged out, but your whole graphical session simply crashes.\nHaving a peek at your crash report, it seems this thread is crashing:\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n\nThe last few calls were to color space functions (or methods), leading me to believe you might simply be dealing with a corrupt ICC profile.\nThe cash is within com.apple.CoreGraphics, and the most recent calls are to:\ncolor_space_get_md5_digest + 57\ncolor_space_get_identifier + 9\nCGXColorSpaceRegistryCopyRegisteredColorSpace + 42\n_CGXCopyColorSpace + 27\n_XCopyColorSpace + 57\n\nNow, if I'm right, it's trying to calculate the MD5 hash of a color space. It's doing that because it wants to find the identifier for a color space, and it needs that identifier because CGXColorSpaceRegistryCopyRegisteredColorSpace needs the color space data for the preset color profile for your monitor. Now, to be 100% this is the source of your crashes, I would need as many of your crash reports as possible, because if they all crash because of different reasons, it has nothing to do with the software on your system but it's more likely to be a hardware issue where bogus data is fed in to the software which then tries to do something with that data which it cannot do and therefore cashes.\nA simple test might be to start Apple's built in ColorSync Utility and pressing the Repair button. This could print something like:\nHeader message digest (MD5) is not correct. Fixed.\n\nWhich would make sense since a broken MD5 might be the source of your crash. So try that first. On my system, that ColorSync Utility is in /Applications/Utilities and I think it has been there since every version of OS X. Please let me know if that found broken ICC files and if it could fix them. If not (either nothing found or unable to fix) please do post any crash logs on WindowServer you have :) \n\nA: Try resetting the SMC and NVRAM while the second monitor is plugged in. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n\nShut down your computer, press left alt, control, shift and the power button at the same time, hold it down for about 5 seconds.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n\nStart your computer and right before you hear the startup chime, press and hold , alt, P and R at the same time until you hear your startup chime again.\nIt might be so that the screen is not supported, - for some reason, if it is not supported, this would unfortunetaly not fix it.\n\nA: I read a lot of these threads and I have the same symptom when I disconnect my last virtual monitor from my Mac Mini (Air Display).\nMy crash stopped happening by disabling Mission Control option \"Displays have separate spaces\".

I change the values of the intervals set in the plist with another script which is why I need to unload and load. Is there another way to do this?\n\nA: Is the problem perhaps that your unload command hasn't finished before the load command starts?\nHow about trying kickstart instead? \"-k\" instructs launchctl to \"kill the running instance before restarting the service.\"\n\nsudo launchctl kickstart -k /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.test.plist\n\nNote that load and unload are now under \"Legacy commands\" in the Yosemite launchctl man page.\n\nA: Thanks Alastair, good to know for the future but presently I am only running Mavericks.\nMy solution was to put the load commands into the first script (which isnt executed by launchd).

Some information  from this Apple note\n\nA: \"Fusion drive\" is yet another name dubbed by apple.. It's what's called generally a \"hybrid ssd\".\nWhat that means is that part of the \"drive\" as such is \"solid state\", in that it world like ram/rom, and the other part is typical motorised magnetic disk hard-drive.\nThe boost in speed is where the \"solid state\" comes in. The most commonly things accessed by the system (loads of things that you won't be aware of) would be kept on there for \"quick access\". The things which the system wouldn't need all too often would remain on the spinning magnetic disc (which is slower to access).\nAll in all, it's a mid-step between spinning magnetic discs and SSD.\nPersonally, and as a mac user...

I'm currently running OS X 10.9.5. Within that I have Windows 8 running in VMWare Fusion 6.0.4 for some critical (but Windows only unfortunately) applications that I use daily.\nIs it safe to upgrade to Yosemite and still run Fusion 6?

I'm hoping that these issues have been ironed out by now?\nThere is now VMWare Fusion 7 which is supposedly \"Ready for Yosemite\" and I'm happy to upgrade but wondered if anyone has had any negative experiences that I should be wary of e.g. losing data, not being able to start the VM etc.\nIf not, should I upgrade the OS first and then Fusion or vice versa?

When I launch a specific application in Mavericks I'd also like to automatically launch and execute another one.   \nIs it possible/how?\n\nA: Open Automator, and choose 'Application' from the pane that appears.\nIn the sidebar, there should be an item called 'Utilities'. Click this, and drag two 'Launch Application' actions into the main workflow pane. In the first one, choose the application you want to use with Spotify, and in the second one, choose Spotify.

(eg. S3)\nI want to know if Apple devices are susceptible to this kind of hardware fragmentation, or if Apple limits that.\n\nA: While I can't find you documentation describing the exact hardware differences of each carrier's iPhones and iPads, it is to my knowledge that all Apple devices are relatively the same across the board, save cellular hardware.\nHowever, Apple is known to source different components from different manufacturers, but there is nothing I can find to determine whether or not a certain carrier set of iDevices uses different hardware universally compared to another carrier.\nAn example of this was Apple's controversial sourcing of LG and Samsung displays for the first MacBook Pros with Retina Displays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdhIA8-UIRQ\nWrapping it up, Apple may use components from different suppliers that may be marginally different in some aspect, but there's no evidence to suggest that one carrier has a different hardware set compared to another, excluding cellular hardware.\nAnd with Apple's philosophy of delivering a consistent and delightful user experience no matter what type of Apple device their using leads me to believe that the differences in those components are negligible (though there was anger regarding the aforementioned rMBP display snafu).\n", "Q: i phone 5 screen replacement Is there a difference between these two replacement parts ?\n60 Dollars \n55 Dollars \n30 Dollars\nor is there another one you would recommend ?

This shows the file in Finder.\nProblem: this always opens the result in a new Finder window (despite having set the general setting in Finder as Always open in new Tab).\nQuestion: How does one force Spotlight to always open results in a new Tab of the (last opened) Finder window? I am looking for a Terminal command, or something which does not involve having to download a special programme. (I already installed Totalfinder and that achieved nothing.)\n\nA: Same thing bothering me. As far as I can tell, there is no 'native' Finder solution. \nHowever, as a (belated) suggestion to OP, or anyone else with the same problem, here's how I solved it for myself -- sort of a 'hack', but better than Finder default behavior:\nUse some keyboard customization software (I'm using Karabiner), and define a (user activated) shortcut that triggers two other keyboard shortcuts that are executed automatically, and in sequence. The shortcuts that do the trick are: (1) Reveal in Finder, (2) Merge all windows.\nDetails: \"Reveal in Finder\" is already bound to a shortcut natively (cmd-R), but \"Merge all windows\" is not afaik. Since adding menu items in Karabiner is a bit tricky, probably the easiest way is to assign a shortcut to \"Merge...\" in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App shortcuts. I picked cmd-shift-M. You can then make use of this (OSX) shortcut in the definition of a Karabiner shortcut.\nIn Karabiner, I then defined a custom shortcut (cmd-R), triggering cmd-R and cmd-shift-M. \nThe effect is pretty close to what I wanted to see in the first place: in a Finder search tab/window, I select an item, press cmd-R, which reveals the item in a new window, which is immediately merged into the existing window as a new tab. \nFocus remains on main window, the new tab goes to the end of the tab bar, and I can continue revealing other items immediately without having to cycle tabs.\nThe one thing that still bothers me: the \"merge windows\" animation is slow-ish, and I can't find a way to speed it up (or disable it).\nLike I said, not perfect perhaps, but it's reasonably close to what I had in mind.\n\nA: Xtra Finder does this automatically and I had been using it. However I found it slow after upgrading to Yosemite - like many other things - so I uninstalled it to give the Finder another chance with the hope it had improved. Sadly it remains really limited and like you, I use Spotlight to navigate to folders and find it infuriating that it keeps launching new windows.\nI would also love a fix to this.\nBTW XtraFinder is free and has other benefits like using the delete key to delete a file\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite Improperly Ejecting External Devices I have a WD My Passport Ultra and I had it plugged into my MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2012 Model and I had just closed the lid and it went to sleep.\nThen I came back hours later and when I opened it a message was stating that it had been improperly ejected even though it was still plugged in.\nI wanted to know if this was normal and if anyone else is experiencing this.\n\nA: It happens occasionally with my external drive which I suspect is a connection problem. I run 10.7.5 so I would judge it unlikely to be a Yosemite issue. If slightly moving the cable around replicated the behaviour, that's probably it.\nBut no, clearly this is not normal. It would not hurt to try it on other systems which I don't currently have the hardware to do.\n\nA: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011)\nEvery USB hard disk, flash drive, or SD Card I have ever connected to this computer occasionally reports this error when the computer wakes up. It doesn't matter whether the computer went to sleep after non-use, closing the lid, or low battery hibernation. The only workable solutions I know of are to disable sleep, never drain the batter completely, and always disconnect every external disk immediately after use.\nThis is not a small problem. Disconnecting a device without first flushing the write cache poses a serious risk of data loss and/or filesystem corruption.\n", "Q: 2010 Mac Mini Downgrade I have a 2010 Mac Mini with no DVD drive and a 5,400 RPM hard drive. Of late, it's begun to get quite sluggish, and I'm fairly sure it's the slow HDD that's to blame.\nI took a look at the means of upgrading it, but since it involves practically taking the entire thing apart to get to the hard drive, I decided it wasn't something I wanted to do myself.\nMy first option is to simply do a complete format of the machine (I only really use it for Plex media streaming), and see if that helps speed it up. This hasn't been done in the few years I've owned the Mini, I've just always kept it updated, and I guess it may have become bloated (though there's not much installed on it).\nMy second option is to attempt to downgrade the Yosemite install that's currently on it back down to something older (and presumably quicker). I can probably go back as far as Lion/Mountain Lion if need be, combined with the full format. So basically revert to stock Lion, re-install Plex, and away I go.\nSo, a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In this situation, is a complete format / re-install of Yosemite likely to help? If so, will the recovery partition handle this?\n\n*If not, what's the best means of downgrading back to an older OS such as Lion, and if I do this, am I likely to see speed increases purely because the older OS's are less demanding? Can I make an installer on a USB stick, since my Mini has no disc drive?\n\n\nA: So I made a Mountain Lion boot stick, wiped it, reinstalled fresh, and it's blazing fast again. Either Yosemite / Mavericks beforehand had slowed it down, or the drive itself had just become very fragmented / clogged / heavy.\nAll good now, I'd forgotten how nippy the thing can be!\n\nA: If you're adept at such things, you could swap out the internal 54K RPM drive with a SSD, and put the 54K drive into an external enclosure for Plex data.\nOWC* (Macsales.com) sells kits with an external enclosure, cable & instructions. It'll make the Mini as fast as heck. I did this for a friend of mine on a tight budget and she's very pleased.\nAn alternative is to swap the 54K drive with a 72K RPM, but the SSD prices are so low, its hard now to justify using a HD with moving parts.\n*Disclaimer: I have no financial stake in OWC - I'm just a satisfied customer.\n\nA: If you don't want to replace the drive (an SSD can make any computer seem much faster) then you could try defragging the drive. There are a number of utilities out there that defrag, however I remember hearing that Mac OS included an on the fly built in defragging service a few revisions back, making most defragging utilities a questionable investment.\nThat said your Mac may be suffering from a lot of installs/uninstalls. In other words the left behind cruft of previous installations that may still be having an effect on system performance.\nSome of those are user specific and simply creating another user account might point out where the problem lies. Failing that checking for extra startup items or stuff left behind that doesn't show up in the startup items (~/Library/Startup Items and the one for the whole system) might point to some things that are still running that don't need to be. It requires a bit of sleuthing around in the filesystem but it might yield a thing or two.\nThe other thing it might be is that as you upgrade O/S versions they generally require more and more of the system (resources, drive access, RAM, etc.) and stepping back to an earlier version of the O/S might yield substantial performance increases.\nYes adding an SSD and/or more RAM would actually be the easiest route to go (check out iFixit for very good take apart instructions), if not the cheapest, as you are upgrading hardware to compensate for system slowness. But you can cheaply (at the expense of potentially a lot of your time) troubleshoot the slowness and/or back down to an earlier O/S and regain some of the snappiness you miss.\n", "Q: How can change hard disk name (not partition) The title is self-explained: I want to change the hard disk name (not the partition).

Select RightZoom in the window (don't bother with the check mark at this point) and click the minus (-) underneath the list. Locate the RightZoom application icon wherever you keep it on the computer, and drag it into the list you just deleted it from. You couldn't do that in Mavericks, but it makes the process work better in Yosemite. That way, if the permissions associated with an older version of the package or one that's gotten misplaced on your hard drive, you can set it right.

I was staying in a hotel last week and when I connected to their WiFi network with my iPhone 4S, after agreeing on their terms and conditions (you must choose their network and it takes you automatically to the hotel's site where you agree some terms to complete the connection, many hotels charge you this way for their WiFi) a push notification trying to sell something came into my screen; this notification had \"accept\" and \"later\" buttons. Does anyone know how this happened, is it a notification launched by the website or sent directly though the WiFi network? I didn't have any apps related to the hotel which may have launched it.\nThis was not the kind of notifications you can look at in the notification center, it was more like a system alert.\n\nA: You can stop that in the future by:\nChanging: File Name\nCaptive network assistant\n\nto\nNo More captive network assistant\n\nin System/Library/CoreServices\nSo the file is still there. \nIf you want to change it back just change the name back to original\n\nA: Without seeing a screenshot of the message my best guess is that they were faking a system alert prompt using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nUsually when you get prompted to log into a hotel's WiFi network you are sent to a web view with HTML content, so once you've logged into their network it wouldn't be hard to immediately send you to some advertising.\nIt could be that the hotel gets their WiFi from somewhere cheap or free, with the idea being that the WiFi provider makes their money back on adverts.\n", "Q: iCloud features requiring use of @icloud.com account versus actual account name My wife and I use several features of iCloud, like calendars, reminders, and more.

This gets to be annoying, because we never remember, and she doesn't use that @icloud.com account for anything. \nShe can sign into iCloud on her devices and the web with her gmail account. \nIf I share to her gmail account, it never gets to her. If I share to her @icloud.com account, she gets all invites, and actually gets the notifications in her Gmail. \nHow do I get this to work without the extra account?\n\nA: I had a similar issue and eventually got sick of dealing with the issues you have noticed and gave in and used the icloud account. Calendar, app store, reminders, notes, etc. It all works better with the icloud account. I never use the email address associated with it (and I've had one since the @me.com days).\nYes it is annoying but Apple's built-in apps work much better with Apple's accounts. You can spend hours of your time troubleshooting or moving over to dedicated 3rd party apps or just \"grin and bear it.\"\nI know that doesn't solve your problem, per se.

(At least for me...)\nI'm using a Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX, and was having the EXACT same problem not being able to assign Show Desktop, Mission Control, etc., to the mouse buttons from the System Preferences-> Mission Control area as I had previously.\nThe reason is because I had installed Logitech's proprietary Control Center software which overrides selections in System Preferences -> Mission Control.\nSimple Fix: \nGo to System Preferences-> Logitech Control Center\n\nFrom here click on the image of your mouse that appears on the screen, which will make available the \"Configure...\" button, upon which you should now click.\n\nOn the next page, this is where the magic happens! You see the available buttons on the left side of the screen, and the actions you are able to assign to those buttons on the right side of the screen (Assigned action).

You don't need to close the window for your selections to take effect, which is as it was before, and quite wonderful.\nHope this helps!!\n\nA: It's long overdue – I hope you've been able to fix it – but for future generations, deleting \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\nrebooting, and setting it up again should help.\nHowever, another reboot will break it again so either a) only put the computer to sleep, which many do regardless, or b) download a utility such as USBOverdrive and use it to invoke a key press configured to Show Desktop using a mouse button (or Show Desktop itself if the utility supports that option).\n\nA: If you have a Logitech Mouse:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Missing Control and look up the keyboard shortcut for the functionality Show Desktop (or any other you are interested in).\n\n\n*Open Logitech Options and set the button to that shortcut.\n\nA: \nYou will notice that as you choose different options from the \"Assigned action\" column in the dropdown menu that the options in the bottom half of the screen will also change to correspond with the Action you selected from the menu.

I have tried iForgot to restore my password, but it didn't work out as it keeps telling me that my answers are wrong. \n\nA: Yes, you will be required to verify your account when you first log in. \nI would suggest trying to get to the bottom of it BEFORE you upgrade, it will be harder after (since you should still have some access to email accounts etc).\nAlso, I would research the effects of running iOS8 on an iPhone 4S. Although it may be supported, I would think it would be incredibly slow.\nI know you didn't ask for the second part of this answer, but I would strongly recommend you do some more research on this before blindly doing it.\n\nA: Yes, the iCloud password is required after an upgrade to enable iCloud on the device.\nIf you are providing answers you believe to be correct, and the iForgot system is not recognizing them, you will need to contact Apple directly. Start at the Contact page for Apple ID support to determine the appropriate contact method for your country or location.\n\nA: I would suggest you recover you password, since you will need it in the future.\nGo to Apple website to recover it.\nThe use the email option to get it.\n", "Q: running a command stored in a bash variable So I'm trying to capture the IP address of a Parallels VM guest (Win8) from the host (OS X).  I thought a bash script would be good for this.  The ultimate goal is to have a single command that will fetch the IP address and then initiate an ssh port redirect.\nI am aware of the prlctl enter command, and I do not believe it supports port redirection.\nMy script thus far:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nVM=\"Win8 Dev\"\nCMD=\"prlctl exec \\\"$VM\\\" ipconfig | grep \"IPv4\" | grep -m1 -o '\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}'\"\necho $CMD\nIP=$($CMD)\necho $IP\n\noutput:  \nprlctl exec \"Win8 Dev\" ipconfig | grep IPv4 | grep -m1 -o\n'\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}' Failed to get VM config:\nThe virtual machine could not be found. The virtual machine is not\nregistered in the virtual machine directory on your Mac. Contact the\nParallels support team for assistance.\n\nSo it appears that the CMD variable is being populated correctly, but something is getting lost when trying to assign the output of the command to the IP variable.\nAny thoughts on what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: If anyone else needs to do this, here is the solution I came up with:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nVM=\"name of my VM\"\nCMD=\"prlctl exec \\\"$VM\\\" ipconfig | grep \"IPv4\" | grep -m1 -o '\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}\\.\\d\\{1,3\\}'\"\nIP=$(eval $CMD)\n\n#once you have the correct data in the $IP variable you can do something with it.. I initiate an ssh session, but you can do whatever you like.\n\nI have no idea why eval is needed here.  Someone more familiar with bash will be needed to answer that mystery.\n", "Q: App store Updates I am getting updates for an other account in my mac, I get updates for an account which is logged in a different mac. why will i get updates for an account which is not active on my mac. Can I disable it? Please suggest me something.\n\nA: The AppleID that is used to download an app from the App Store is permanently embedded in that instance of the application (on the machine it is downloaded to).  So if someone else downloaded an application on your Mac/iOS device, only their AppleID will be able to update it. The reverse is true also. \nOptions:\n1.  Delete the application and reinstall it using your AppleID.\n2.  Have the AppleID that was used to install it sign in to update it.\n3.  Live with the annoyance of not being able to update it.\n", "Q: My son's user account and my user account on my iMac are linked/synced through iCloud. How do I unlink them? On my home iMac - I have separate user accounts for me, my wife, and my two kids, ages 5 & 7.\nThis has worked great - my young children only have access to age-appropriate sites, and bookmarks for all their favorites.\nAfter I upgraded my iMac to Yosemite, however, I noticed that when I first logged into my child's account to confirm that everything worked I was prompted to log into iCloud using my Apple ID.\nI didn't really understand this. I was logged into iCloud on MY user account; why should I have to log in again for my son's user account?\nNevertheless, and foolishly, I did log in again.\nNow - my son's user account and my user account are linked and synced through iCloud. He can see all my bookmarks, and I can see all of his. I'm sure everything else that's stored on iCloud drive are also synced between our two user accounts.\nSo - I guess what I need to do is \"unlink\" my iCloud account from my son's user account. However - I can't figure out how to do that.\nAny advice or suggestions?\n\nA: On your sons account you should be able to open up System Preferences, choose iCloud (you should see your account logged in here). From there just click sign out. It will ask if you want to keep synced bookmarks, contacts, notes, etc you can then choose to delete them or keep them on that account.\nEdit: Short answer: When you remove iCloud Drive from your sons account, your files will still remain on your account.\nLonger answer: I tested out the iCloud Drive problem by creating a new user account managed by parental controls on my Mac. After I created this account, it asked me to sign into my Apple ID, which I did. I then went to sign myself out of the managed user account. I had the same thing occur, it said that my iCloud Drive documents will be deleted from this computer. I clicked delete, and removed them, as well as contacts, bookmarks, etc. When I logged back into my main (administrator) account all of my iCloud Drive files were still there, it is safe to delete iCloud Drive from that account.\n", "Q: MySQL fails to start at restart after Yosemite update I have MySQL installed. When I had the previous version, it used to start after boot automatically. This is not the case after I updated to Yosemite. In System Preferences there is an icon for MySQL and \"Automatically Start MySQL Server on Startup\" is checked. I tried unchecking - restart - check - restart still the same..\nEverytime I boot the computer I will need to start it manually. Any fix?\n\nA: MySQL by default tries to use StartupItems.  That won't work with Yosemite.\nI made a launchd control that is still compatible with the MySQL preferencepane.\nDetails here -\nhttps://github.com/MacMiniVault/Mac-Scripts/blob/master/mmvMySQL/mmvmysql-Yosemite.md\n\nA: From stackoverflow...\nI've done this and it works.

There is a note at the start of the page in Apple's docs explaining this: Startup items are a deprecated technology. Launching of daemons through this process may be removed or eliminated in a future release of OS X.  \n\nA: The best way I've found is to install MySQL with Homebrew, not from the .dmg available from the MySQL or Oracle. If you have Homebrew installed, simply run the following command in Terminal.\nbrew install mysql\n\nThen to have MySQL start automatically, run the following:\nbrew services start mysql\n\n", "Q: iOS 8 Safari verify server identity error We have a site running on https in production.

After doing so, Safari will recognize and trust the server.\n", "Q: Control master audio volume with Siri I Can't control my iPad master volume with Siri, and I'm surprised about that.\nIs there a way to do this control via Siri?\n\nA: It's not possible and it's an oversight that makes hands free impossible.\nWhat about 'Hey Siri, set volume at 50%', and while they're at it 'Hey Siri, turn speaker on'.\nThe excuse of volume being too hard are weak.\n\nA: Reading about the iPhone 7 preview, it seems that it was only a matter of time\n\n\nA: It's likely a safety feature. If someone was using hands free while driving and changed the volume. It could blast really loud music in your ear and cause you to crash. Possibly injuring yourself and others. This would open up Apple to lawsuits. \n\nA: After asking Siri myself, I've found your answer.\nSiri cannot change the volume of your iOS devices.\nThat much is fact, however my theory regarding why Siri is unable to do change such a simple control is pure speculation; I believe Apple didn't implement this functionality because it would be awkward and hard to use.\nHere's the scenario: You're playing music on your iOS device and you want to turn down the volume. You ask Siri to turn down the volume, to which Siri carries out. At this point, one of four things can happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your music is still too loud\n\n*Your music is at the perfect volume for your taste\n\n*The music becomes too quiet\n\n*You are listening to music then someone in your house hold says 'Hi Siri, Turn the volume up'. This would then turn your volume up without you telling it to and it could be too loud for you\n\n\nHow would Siri know what volume you want your music to play at? How can she distinguish what would be the perfect volume to play your music even if you gave a general instruction for her to turn it down or up?\nSure, you they could have programmed Siri to lower the volume down one \"tick\" at a time, but that opens the door to you constantly asking Siri to lower the volume. Same goes with larger increments of volume change in that you couldn't get the volume \"just right\" using Siri.\nToo much uncertainty involved with attempting to provide desired result most likely turned the Siri designers away from implementing the feature.\n\nA: Siri could raise or lower the volume slowly and ask for you to signal when to stop by saying stop. Not saying this is easy, but it's the same way to tell someone to stop filling your glass, at your preferred amount, but there would be needed rules or prompts. Another way would be to set volume by say a graduated number set 0-20. When you ask Siri to change volume she 1st says what you are at, and you can say how many \"points\" to increase or decrease, or set a number. Would take some getting used to but better than nothing. Voice recognition could also differentiate voice, and only allow recognized voice input. You could also set thresholds that wouldn't allow Siri to blow out your speakers with a voice increase limit. \nEdited by peer review: Siri responds to such commands with: \"Sorry, but I'm not able to change that setting.\", hence this answer is completely false.\n", "Q: How do you turn off the \"Try the new Safari\" notification? In OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan, when starting Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, there is an invasive, annoying, and persistent notification, titled \"Try the new Safari.\"\nThere is only two options in the notification.\nClicking on \"Later\" will have the same notification come back next time, and \"Try now\"… well, I dislike being forced to do things on my own computer.\nThis notification reminds me of the annoying popups coming in another famous operating system, Microsoft Windows, and this is one of the many reasons why I am not using it anymore.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nIs there any way to get the notification to not show up anymore without actually trying Apple's Safari?\n\nA: You can get rid of it without giving in to Apple‘s desire for you to “Try Now”. Even if you click the button, they will ask you to change your default and may still ask again at a later time. I have explained it in much greater details on my blog but the gist of it are these three commands:\ndefaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUIHasSafariBeenLaunched -bool YES\ndefaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUIRecommendSafariNextNotificationDate -date 2050-01-01T00:00:00Z\ndefaults write com.apple.coreservices.uiagent CSUILastOSVersionWhereSafariRecommendationWasMade -float 99.99\n\nYou must log out and in again for the change to apply. You should actually do it immediately to prevent the system from reverting the changes.\nI also cover how to stop Safari from prompting you to become the default every few days. (epimorphic touched on this briefly.) Interesting if you need to use Safari on occasions for site-compatibility, testing, or whatever reason. (Oddly enough, I have not heard any automated browsing test suite authors complaining about this yet.)\n\nA: I may have found a solution. Go to System Preferences, then notifications (first line), scroll down to Safari and disable \"Safari alert style\".\nSince I did that, it's stopped popping up...(then at least so far)\nHope it'll help you.\n", "Q: Is there any mini game available for the today section in notification center yosemite? Is there any mini game available for the today section in notification center yosemite like that tile game in dashboard.\n\nA: Not that I am aware of.\nWhile the Notification Center is intended to replace the Dashboard in OS X, the purpose of the Notification Center is much more narrow and focused than the Dashboard. The Notification Center is for notifications, small utilities and sharing widgets in contrast to the catch-all hodgepodge the Dashboard was home to.\n", "Q: Installing Linux on a MacBook Pro and waranty On a 2014 MacBook Pro Retina, does dual-booting the pre-installed OS X with Linux (say Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/etc) void the hardware warranty? Does installing Linux and removing OS X void the hardware warranty?\nI do not mind the entire hard disk being erased and set to a default OS X install if the machine has to be given for repair under warranty.\nIf you're going to suggest \"reinstall OS X yourself before giving for repair\", yes, that is an option if some non-essential component of the machine stops working. But it's not an option if the machine won't boot at all, which is when you'll be in need of servicing the most.\nThe country of purchase is India, if it matters.\n\nA: Installing Linux or any other OS on your Mac does not void your warranty as provided here:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/embedded-mac-warranty-row.html\nThe only thing you should be concerned about if anything is the fact that Apple will not provide support for Linux if you choose to install it on your Mac.\nIf you were to experience issues with Linux on your Mac that you suspected were hardware related, Apple can run a hardware diagnostic on the Mac even if OS X is uninstalled from it. So if you ever ran into an issue where your Mac wouldn't start up as you described in your question, Apple should be able to diagnose the issue and get you a repair provided your Mac is still covered under AppleCare.\n\nA: I don't believe it should affect your hardware warranty, no.  If you had to return the MacBook to Apple and they couldn't boot into Linux, they could just attach an external disk with OS X on it and boot from that.  There are also other options that Apple (or you) can use to boot from OS X such as Internet Recovery, read about the recovery options here.  It seems you can also install the recovery system on an external drive.  As long as you don't go removing or modifying the firmware that manages the hardware then I don't believe your hardware warranty will be affected.  However, I guess the best thing you can do to be certain is speak to Apple.  Nobody else can offer you any certainty.\n", "Q: Installing a major Ruby implementation without XCode A user is wanting to get started with Ruby (and Ruby on Rails), and they don't have XCode installed, and the current internet connection is rather weak.\nAre there any major implementations of Ruby (MRI, JRuby, Rubinius) that can be installed without installing XCode?\nI know OS X comes with a system Ruby, but I've heard that \"Don't touch nothing\" is the best advice with regards to it.\n\nA: OS X includes the ruby interpreter it is in /usr/bin so on your path\nOn Yosemite\nruby --version\n\nshows\nruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]\n\n", "Q: Problem with startup `rc.local` script Until OS X 10.9 I could also run Bootcamp within Virtualbox (through a .vmdk file).

I am a web developer so I change windows/apps a lot. Changing apps makes my machine hang for 2 or more seconds.\nAfter observing the Activity Monitor I can see that WindowServer is taking up a lot of CPU when I move windows and also when I am just using one app.  I have tried closing apps to determine which, if any, is causing the issue but haven't come up with anything useful yet.\nHere is an example.\n\nEven right now as I type is flips between 10% and 20% usage. I am only typing!\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If you're encountering this on Macbook Pro 16'' (2019), this seems to be a well-known problem regarding the laptop body not being able to handle the heat from both the CPU and GPU when external monitors are connected. The ultimate solution seems to be to use an eGPU... which would probably not be practical for most people.\nAn AMD Community thread further pointed out that the culprit is that the dGPU goes on full drive and draws ~20W of power whenever the laptop outputs to multiple monitors, seemingly because the driver lets the dGPU memory run on full clock speed \"to avoid tearing\". This quickly leads to the chassis overheating. Outputting to only one monitor (the count includes the built-in monitor), with no scaling or integer scaling of the resolution, seems to reduce the power usage to ~9W and thus solve the issue.\nFunnily enough, whenever my Mac becomes sluggish, I seem to be able to put it to sleep and wake it up a couple of minutes later in order to make it responsive again for an hour, without closing any apps. This is likely because the power usage on the dGPU drops before going back to ~20W again.\n\nA: My machine has the same problem, what I did is uninstall the Google Chrome, and then everything goes smoothly.\nIt might not help you since you are a web developer and may rely on Chrome\n\nA: for me, the culprit was using Yosemite's new system wide dark mode (Systemsettings->General->use dark status bar and dock). Switching back to bright mode reduced the load of WindowServer for me from >100% to 2-7 %. So if you enabled that, check for that. ;-)\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you've got a second screen attached, disconnect it, reboot, reconnect\n\n*Close Google Chrome\n\n*Still no good? Try this https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6623697 \n\nA: From what I've collected yet, the following might be able to help you (find my personal experiences in italic):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mission Control: switch \"Displays have separate Spaces off\", switch Dashboard off. Dashboard as an overlay really slowed things down for me\n\n*Fix disk permissions, reset System Management Controller, reset PRAM (Luis Mercado explained this well at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6623697). I had some minor success with this, but the issue started occuring later anyway\n\n*Reduce transparency effects (it's in System Preferences > Accessibility under Display). I've tried this, it might improve the performance but I was missing the look so I've switched it back.\n\n*Switch off automatic graphic switching (System Preferences > Energy Saver). This was the best option for me, as I don't really worry about energy consumption, but honestly I don't think that there should be a real need for this.\nI'm not yet aware of a real solution yet, let's hope that Apple will fix this in 10.10.1.\nedit: I've updated to 10.10.1 and the issue still persists, so I guess we will have to wait longer or go with the reinstall.\nedit 2: Switching to El Capitan has vastly improved this, so for me, this is no longer an issue.\n\nA: As mentioned by most of the answers, it may be due a menu bar item of yours..\nI was experiencing the same behavior and removed iStat Menu bar as well as Little Snitch and after that the situation improved significantly.\n\nA: CrashPlan Tray is definitely one culprit for high CPU usage. It helps to disable animations in the tray preferences. \nBut it still did not solve the problem for me. The only thing that solves it for perhaps a week seems to be a full reboot. After that the machine simply becomes sluggish, and needs to be rebooted. Back to Windows95 yay! Apple should do something about this – but no, the problem seems to have been around forever. At least they should provide instructions/application to debug this and find the external culprit, if it is an external application. But I'm increasingly beginning to think it is is mainly WindowServer getting tangled up with itself, exacerbated by other applications' task bar updates etc.\n\nA: I used to experience this problem, until I upgraded to OS X 10.10.2. Now I can go for weeks without rebooting, and the window animations will stay smooth, and the WindowServer process will not use a lot of CPU.\n\nA: \nHi, try this:\nDisable the \"Display have separate Spaces\"\nLogOff and Login again, check the process...\nall fine?\n\nA: I had a similar issue with high cpu usage in WindowServer which I managed to get back to something more normal by removing any items in my menu bar that were making high frequency drawing updates. \nIn my case it was the Network Monitor from Little Snitch that seemed to be the biggest culprit.\n\nA: I deleted my old answer since it had turned out to be only a temporary fix (if even a fix at all). Today I found something that cleared up most of the slowness for me which I describe in detail in this link:\nYosemite: Accessibility zoom + multiple monitors = poor performance\nSomehow my user preference file, com.apple.sidebarlists.plist, had acquired several keys with very long values (all named Bookmark); the lengths ranged from about 2.7 MB to 4.3 MB which made the size of the preference file larger than 11 MB. It appears that whenever an operation occurred that needed to access the (sequential) preference data from that file, reading the entire file brought everything to a near standstill until complete. (When I was looking at the file with an editor I experienced the same slowness in moving through the file.) Removing that file has eliminated nearly all the slowness that I was experiencing since switching to Yosemite and continues to do so.\nI do think we're dealing with several different issues that are causing Yosemite to slow down and any of us may have one or more of these issues. I'm still seeing long dumps of trackpad gestures in my system log which I had felt was the cause of the slowness but now appears to only slow things down at certain times (as well as cause Firefox's scrolling to fail) after using Firefox for a while; the rest of the machine seems back to it's normal speed.\nIf anyone finds the same thing and, if so, removes this preference file then it would be good to either validate or invalidate this as a possible cause since the solution is so seemingly elusive so far. This change has made such a dramatic difference in using Yosemite for me that I hope this is a solution for many others suffering from the slow down since upgrading to Yosemite.\n", "Q: Possible to change Quick-Reply buttons in Mail Notifications? Yosemite introduced a new feature to quick reply within a notification.\nMail offers the options to trash a new E-Mail or reply to it. But, instead of trash, I want to archive it. \nCan I change somewhere the buttons/behaviour within notifications?\n\nA: It looks like it is impossible for now, but will hopefully be in next year's release. All that I've seen that you can do to is to style notifications by changing button names and menu title and with Mjolnir. Beyond that isn't built in to the API yet.\nSimilar question here\n", "Q: In OSX Yosemite, why can I set many environment variables for GUI apps, but cannot set the specific variable PATH After I had sorted out OSX' PATH issues up to the  Mavericks release, the problems come back in Yosemite!!! \nSo I want to mimic the old launch.conf feature in the new Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite release, in order to have the PATH environment variable  in GUI apps like Carbon Emacs or RStudio available. I used the great idea of stackoverflow user ursa to set up a shell script which configures environment variables via launchctl. (See his stackoverflow answer here.) This works for most environment variables, but not for the PATH variable.\n1. What have I done?\nFirst I wrote  the  /etc/environment.rc script looking like:\nlaunchctl setenv PATH /Users/halloleo/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nlaunchctl setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/local/jdk1.7\nlaunchctl setenv ENVIRONMENT_RC \"yes\"\n\nThen I created the  plists for launchd (listings of these and of other mentioned scripts in the appendix below). Then I activated them with\n$ sudo launchctrl load ...\n\nThen I disabled the path_helper utility in shell init file /etc/profile, so that it does not overwrite the environment.rc settings. And finally I restarted the machine.\n2. What's the effect?\nWhen I start up Terminal the new environment variables JAVA_HOME and ENVIRONMENT_RC are set according to environment.rc, but PATH is set to\n/usr/bin:/bin\nIn order to make sure, no bash init file got in the way I wrote a little python script instead (in the appendix as well) to show the variables in the current environment and I execute this directly by double clicking a Platypus wrapper. Again the new variables are set, while PATH has the system default.\nSo why can I set other variables, but not the PATH variable? And how can I solve this in a unified way?\nUpdate:\nThe situation is very puzzling: The shell (bash at least) in Terminal or Emacs will pick up the PATH you set via launchctl, but other GUI apps will not do so., e.g. the mentioned minimal python script straight called via Platypus will not show your custom path. And even Emacs itself does not know the correct PATH: You notice this e.g. when you issue the Emacs command M-x ispell-buffer; the unix tool ispell which emacs tries to call won't be found if it is just on your custom path.\n\nAppendix\nnet.halloleo.environment.plist, the launchd config file in /Library/LaunchDaemons/:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>net.halloleo.environment</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/sh</string>\n        <string>/etc/environment.rc</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/etc/environment.rc</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nnet.halloleo.environment-user.plist, the launchd config file in /Library/LaunchAgents/:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>net.halloleo.environment-user</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/sh</string>\n        <string>/etc/environment.rc</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/etc/environment.rc</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n/etc/profile, the modified bash start-up file:\n# System-wide .profile for sh(1)\n\n# if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n#   eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n# fi\n\nif [ \"${BASH-no}\" != \"no\" ]; then\n    [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\nfi\n\nshow_environ.py, the script displaying all environment variables:\nimport os\nprint (os.environ)\n\n\nA: PATH in Yosemite can and should be set within /etc/paths file.

In the end I ran into this bug report, which seems to exactly describe my problem (I'm not sure to what extend it's related to your problem, but there seems to be a bug in Yosemite/launchd in combination with PATH and scripts such as python:\nhttp://www.openradar.me/18945659\nThe solution seems to be to start a shell script which then starts the python. Not really what I like, but it's the way it is....\n\nA: The problem is that launchd appends another PATH variable instead of replacing the one in the environment. Most programs use getenv which always returns the first occurence of a variable, shells instead iterate through all environment variables and import them as local variables thus overwriting previous instances with the last one.\nThis is obviously a bug in launchd, environment variables passed to a program should be unique.\n", "Q: Finder not showing correct free space? I have a software called Daisy Disk and it says I only have 70 GB left in my drive. However in Finder I see 131 GB available.\nHow is this 60 GB difference possible?\n\nA: Finder does not take into account Time Machine's Local Snapshots. The storage space of these local snapshots will be given to files if necessary and therefore the space is not actually being consumed. Daisy Disk sees these files though and takes them into account when calculating the free space.\nYou can disable local snapshots by turning off Time Machine completely, or to retain Time Machine functionality without local snapshots you can run the following command:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal\n\n", "Q: Process completed immediately after opening Terminal After I open Terminal in OS X:\nLast login: Tue Oct 28 10:29:21 on ttys000 login(14773,0x7fff7572f300) malloc: * error for\nobject 0x7fd4bb715110: pointer being freed was not allocated * set a breakpoint in\nmalloc_error_break to debug\n\n[Process completed]\n\nI have no idea what I did or how to fix it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Terminal icon on Dock, press right click and press New Command\n2./bin/bash -x      (it shows your problem)\n\n*sudo nano .bash_profile (open this problem place)\n\n*delete this, Ctrl + X (exit) Yes, Enter\n\n\nA: Go to Preferences → General and set Shells open with to Command, and enter the following:\n/bin/bash -x\n\nOpen a new shell and see what is being run, then remove the relevant lines from your profile files.\n\nA: I know this is old...but I had the same problem, and couldn't find any information to fix this issue, so I decided to share the solution here too.\nHopefully it helps someone else. :)\nAfter upgrading a Mac from OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) to 10.11.4 (El Capitan), it would no longer open a shell in Terminal.

When the Yosemite installer pops up you can quit that.  Go to Applications-->Install OS X Yosemite.app and copy the installer app. Then copy the installer to the other minis using your preferred local distribution method (ex. flash drive, ARD, cmd line). \n\nA: tron_jones has a great answer.\nAdditionally, if you'd like to make a USB key so that you can do more than just update a system in place, you can follow these instructions:\nhttp://www.iclarified.com/44701/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-yosemite-usb-install-key\nI use the install keys to do installs where I first want to wipe the harddrive clean.

Give it a minute and check to see where it's hanging.  It might not give you a clear cut answer but it can surely provide some clues.\nIn my experience this often comes back to a failing/failed hard drive.  This is often reinforced when I see entries for \"Disk I/O read/write error\" or similar in verbose mode.\nAssuming you don't see Disk I/O errors you might also try resetting the PRAM and/or SMC.\nTo reset the PRAM:\nPower on your Mac while holding ⌘+option+P+R until you hear the Mac chime twice, then release the keys and let it boot normally.\nThe SMC reset is somewhat model dependent.\nFor Macs with a removable battery: Remove the battery and disconnect the power cord, hold the power button for 5 seconds, reinstall the battery, reconnect the power cord and power on.\nFor Macs without a removable battery:\nConnect your Mac to it's MagSafe adapter, on the left side of the Mac press and hold Shift+control+option and the power button for 1 second then release all at the same time.  Without holding any keys press the power button again to power on the Mac.\nHopefully that helps!\n\nA: I tried almost everthing but nothing helped until I unplugged all the peripherals.

This didn't remove the accounts from the Mail interface, so I tried deleting the Accounts.plist file - this removes all accounts I had configured, though, and I didn't want that - I wanted to ensure that the correct iCloud account was ONLY added by the iCloud pane in system preferences, to prevent any more duplicates.\nIn the end, I opened the Accounts.plist file in a text editor and removed all information pertaining to the unwanted accounts. The .plist format is very easy to read, so this is not very difficult at all – but I do recommend you use a text editor capable of highlighting matching tags in an XML file.\nThe part you're looking for begins with the following:\n<key>MailAccounts</key>\n<array>\n\nthe next thing you'll see is a <dict> tag. This is the beginning of an individual account 'object'; all information for each account will be between <dict> and </dict> tags. Find the 'block' that seems to correspond to the account you don't want, and delete everything from the <dict> to the </dict>, including the tags themselves. Be careful though, because there's another set of  tags nested inside to contain info about the vendor of your email account - you want to be sure you're selecting the matched outer pair.\nHaving done this, I was able to load up Mail again, and the unwanted accounts were gone. The remaining accounts were working fine.\nP.S. If I have forgotten to delete some other trace that will come back to bite me, please let me know/edit this post.

The way the disks are mounted is not conventional:\n/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\n/dev/disk1s2 on /Users (hfs, local, journaled)\nmap -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)\nmap auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\n\ndisk0s2 is internal SSD drive and disk1s2 is internal 1TB HDD drive.\nI've read that upgrading to Yosemite will convert my drives to fusion drive1, though I have not found detailed information what would happen in my situation. I have a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*did anybody try upgrading Mavericks to Yosemite with similar drive configuration? What were the results?\n\n*will Yosemite convert my two drives to Fusion drive? (I read that in order to convert it, it needs to erase contents, so I'm assuming that upgrade procedure won't create fusion drive)\n\n*if the fusion drive will be created automatically, I guess I can't control which data is on SSD and which data is on HDD anymore, right? I use virtual machines heavily (vmware) and I don't want them all on ssd...\n\n\nSince this machine is my primary workhorse, I'm reluctant to just try and see if it works. I've upgraded my Macbook air (single ssd drive) without issues, fwiw.\n\nA: The answer is: OS X did not upgrade my disks to Fusion Drive (or CoreStorage).\n[miha:~]diskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\nProbably because of the unconvetional layout. Or perhaps some other unknown reason.\n", "Q: Black screen when open Time Machine on Yosemite I use a 13 Macbook with a thunderbolt display on Yosemite. Since the installation of last osx version, if I try to open Time Machine I can only see a completely black screen on laptop screen. The other screen remains with previously opened windows. So, time machine is completely unusable. I can only use ESC to exit.\nAny ideas of what can be happening here?\nIf I don't connect my second monitor, works fine.\nThis is my displays configuration:\n\n\nA: Unplugging my second display 'solved' the issue. Not ideal, but an adequate solution for me to get into Time Machine quickly on the odd occasion. \n\nA: If you have this issue using Yosemite, i found a turn around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Preferences - Mission Control\n\n*Uncheck \"Displays have separate Spaces\"\n\n*logout and login\n\n\nThis will fix Time Machine to display black screen in one monitor. The side effect of this is you loose the abilitty to use monitors as separate spaces but isn't that bad.\n\nA: Yes, the issue seems to be with handling multiple monitors and spaces. I found a surprisingly simple workaround, that worked for me, without switching anything on and off, rebooting or changing settings permanently: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into your System Preferences, Choose Displays and check the button for mirroring your two monitors (for procedure see Apple's instructions under Arrange your displaysenter link description here)\n\n*Enter your Time Machine and do what you have to do.\n\n*When you are finished, uncheck the Mirror displays button.\n\n\nThat's it. Curious to know if it worked for others? \nIf it did, Apple might think of just doing that. Besides, re-experimenting the past with two exactly identical images somehow adds to the mystique of the experience.\n\nA: Yes, happens identically to me. As the second monitor is operational try ESC (if not, hold the off button for three seconds, the option menu will appear on your second menu, click sleep then space bar to exit sleep and primary monitor will return). Now switch off and unplug the secondary monitor, try again, voila, all (should) works fine.\n\nA: Running OS X Yosemite on a Mac mini and simply hitting the off button on the secondary screen worked just fine.  No need to unplug or logoff.\n", "Q: /bin/sh don't read .profile after update to mac os x 10.10 I have updated my mac os x to 10.10 and got a lot of problems with program compilations. It looks like that default /bin/sh are not reading .profile anymore. So, all scripts, which are dependent from environment variables don't works. Even make cannot perform compilations because it cannot find compiler executables in non-default paths. Some (but not all!) macports ports are broken now, I think because of this problem. Does anybody know, how to fix this?\nThanks in advance,\nPavel.\n\nA: Check to see if something loaded a '.bash_profile', which would be read in preference to .profile.  If so, you can probably move it out of the way:\nmv .bash_profile .saved_bash_profile\n\n", "Q: Steam keeps asking for accessibility features even though is has access? This only happens to me on Yosemite. I gave Steam access as per my previous question. Steam worked fine until the upgrade to Yosemite. What may have changed, and has anyone a clue how to fix that without deinstalling a few terabytes of video games?\n\nA: This seems to be a known bug for Yosemite.\nSteam has to be updated to work 100% with compatibility for Yosemite. Just wait for them to fix it.\n\nA: A temporary fix (requires terminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/Tcc.db 'delete from access where client like \"%Steam%\"'\n\n*Restart Steam\n\n*Allow steam access in accessibility via UI or something like: sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO access values ('kTCCServiceAccessibility','com.valvesoftware.steam',0,1,0,NULL);\"\n", "Q: How can I stop Yosemite’s Mail app crashing when I click on my sent or drafts folder? Since I upgraded to Yosemite a couple of days ago, I’ve had a problem with the Mail app.\nWhenever I click on the “Drafts” or “Sent” folder, the app hangs (i.e. won’t accept any input), beachballs, and seems to stay like that until I force-quit it using the Finder (I’ve left it for a few minutes and haven’t seen it crash of its own accord yet).\nI’ve tried removing my one third-party add-on (SpamSieve), removing Mail’s saved state, and removing Mail’s container folder, as described here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macissues.com/2014/10/19/fix-mail-crashing-after-upgrading-to-yosemite/\nI’ve also tried disabling my primary e-mail account (which is with FastMail).

How can one change the system font system wide in OSX Yosemite? I am using Tinkertool at present but it only changes font in applications and not the Finder, status bar or any other fonts!\n\nA: As of today the only 2 ways i know of are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Hack the CFF headers of a font: github example and put the modified font(s) in a prioritized font folder.\n\n*The other one indeed is TinkerTool. However you have to spoof your version of Mac OS X temporarily to make it work. According to this site and this post 4th entry:\nGo to System/Library/CoreServices inside your OS X hard drive and open the file SystemVersion.plist with TextEdit. Change the system version listed under \"ProductVersion\" to 10.9. You should also change \"ProductUserVisibleVersion\", just so that you can confirm that the edit worked later by going to the About This Mac page.\n", "Q: Set up ad-hoc FTP server?

I leave my Mac running 24/7, but I'm not always sitting at it.\nIs there any way to tell the Mac, or Messages specifically, if my phone isn't on the local wifi subnet, don't take messages, leave them for my iPhone to pick up.\nCurrently, if for some reason I'm out of iMessage range but capable of receiving SMS, messages never arrive at my phone & are not re-transmitted after failing by the sender, because the system considers that handing them to my Mac is sufficient proof I saw them.\nMissing jobs I was offered 6 hours ago, just because I was afk, is not a happy sight to return home to.\nOne option: log out of Messages on the Mac every time I leave the house...\n...I'll never remember.\nEdit: Logging out of iMessage on the Mac is considerably more trouble than it's worth. It generates half a dozen messages & emails to every device & account...\n\nA: First of all, you need homebrew installed on your system. If you haven't, visit http://brew.sh for instructions, or let me know and I will try to guide you.\nThen you need to install arp-scan. To do it, open a Terminal and type brew install arp-scan. \nNext step. Save the following script, I called check-iphone-available.scpt, but your can rename if you want.\nset IPHONE to do shell script \"if /usr/local/bin/arp-scan -l | grep your-iphone-mac; then echo 1; else echo 0; fi\" user name \"your-username\" password \"your-password\" with administrator privileges\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Messages\"\n        tell menu bar 1\n            tell menu bar item \"Messages\"\n                tell menu \"Messages\"\n                    tell menu item \"My Status\"\n                        tell menu \"My Status\"\n                            if IPHONE is not equal to \"0\" then\n                                click menu item \"Available\"\n                            else\n                                click menu item \"Away\"\n                            end if\n                        end tell\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n             end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nReplace your-username, your-password and your-iphone-mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*your-username must be an administrator user that can sudo on your computer.\n\n*your-password password for that user.\n\n*your-iphone-mac can be obtained on your iphone, go to Settings -> General -> About and copy Wi-Fi Address.\n\n\nGive permissions: chmod 775 check-iphone-available.scpt.\nThe script execute as administrator the command arp-scan. This command sends  ARP  packets  to  hosts on the local network and displays any responses that are received. The grep command look for your iphone on the answer receive by arp-scan. If the iphone is found, then return 1, otherwise, return 0. On 1, the script do click on Available menu item in Messages, on 0, the same on Away (can be changed by Offline, On the phone, etc).\nSo, let's do it automatically.\nGo to folder /Users/your-username/Library/LaunchAgents and save there the following plist file. I named it com.username.checkiphone.plist, but again, feel free to change it.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.your-username.checkiphone</string>\n\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n    <string>/Users/your-username/bin/check-iphone-available.scpt</string>\n  </array>\n\n  <key>Nice</key>\n  <integer>1</integer>\n\n  <key>StartInterval</key>\n  <integer>60</integer>\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/com.your-username.checkiphone-available.err</string>\n\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n  <string>/tmp/com.your-username.checkiphone-available.out</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe file is pretty self-explanatory. We will launch the command /usr/bin/osascript /Users/your-username/bin/check-iphone-available.scpt every 60 seconds, will be launched at load, will save errors on /tmp/com.username.checkiphone-available.err and logs on /tmp/com.username.checkiphone-available.out.\nAgain, replace your-username appropriately.\nLast step, tell the Mac launchd daemon to load it.\nlaunchctl load com.your-username.checkiphone.plist\n\nTo stop the script, just replace the word load with unload in the above sentence. When your restart your computer the script will be load again. To prevent it, move it to another folder.\n\nA: Second solution. This time based on bluetooth.\nDownload Bluetooth Proximity Tasker. Sorry mate, but it's $2.99.\n\nRun any AppleScript when a paired bluetooth device goes in and out of range. Adjust the range using signal strength.\n\nSelect your BT device and paste this script on In Range Applescript:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Messages\"\n        tell menu bar 1\n            tell menu bar item \"Messages\"\n                tell menu \"Messages\"\n                    tell menu item \"My Status\"\n                        tell menu \"My Status\"\n                                click menu item \"Available\"\n                        end tell\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n             end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nReplace Available with Away in the script and paste on Out Of Range Applescript.\n\nA: Third solution. For this to work your must have an account in ifttt.com (and ifttt app for iPhone) and also a Dropbox account.\nI create a couple of recipes in ifttt, If I'm at home create a file on Dropbox and If I leave home create a file on Dropbox. You will have to modify it with your address.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first one create a file called AtHome in the directory IFTTT/iOS on your Dropbox folder.\n\n*Second one create a file called Out in the directory IFTTT/iOS on your Dropbox folder.\n\n\nOn both recipes when your iphone enters or leaves and area you defined (your house), create one or another file in your Dropbox.\nThen this is easier to tack for both files with this applescritp. The script is looking for files created and if exists, change iMessages accordingly and then delete the file. If none of those files exists it will do nothing, so, iMessages will keep the status until the next file is created.\non FileExists(theFile) -- (String) as Boolean\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        if exists file theFile then\n            return true\n        else\n            return false\n        end if\n    end tell\nend FileExists\n\nset IPHONE to FileExists(\"/Users/username/Dropbox/IFTTT/iOS/AtHome\")\nif IPHONE then\n    set CHANGESTATUS to true\n    do shell script \"rm -rf /Users/username/Dropbox/IFTTT/iOS/AtHome\"\nelse\n    set CHANGESTATUS to false\nend if\n\nif CHANGESTATUS is not equal to true then\n    set IPHONE to FileExists(\"/Users/username/Dropbox/IFTTT/iOS/Out\")\n    if IPHONE then\n        set CHANGESTATUS to true\n        set IPHONE to false\n        do shell script \"rm -rf /Users/username/Dropbox/IFTTT/iOS/Out\"\n    end if\nend if\n\nif CHANGESTATUS then\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Messages\"\n            tell menu bar 1\n                tell menu bar item \"Messages\"\n                    tell menu \"Messages\"\n                        tell menu item \"My Status\"\n                            tell menu \"My Status\"\n                                if IPHONE then\n                                    click menu item \"Available\"\n                                else\n                                    click menu item \"Offline\"\n                                end if\n                            end tell\n                        end tell\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend if\n\nYou must change /Users/username/Dropbox/IFTTT/iOS/ to point to your real path.\nAfter this, replace the script of my first answer with this, and should work!\n", "Q: iOS Developer Account - 50GB iCloud space still available. Will it go away? I have an iOS developer account for which 50GB of space on iCloud Drive (or whatever the overall service is called these days) was allocated, when I installed iOS 8.0 beta on one of my devices (an iPhone).\nWhen iOS 8.0 released to the public I got an email saying that my 50GB limit was to be withdrawn.\nBut it hasn't happened and I can still see that much available (I don't have a paid plan - I'm only eligible for 5GB). Secondly, perhaps for this reason, iCloud Photo library has been available on all my devices since installing iOS 8.0, (the iPhone which was last updated to the iOS 8.0 GM Seed, and the other, an iPad, which went from iOS 7.0.x to 8.0.2 directly upon public release of 8.0.2)  whereas if I understand correctly, it is only being made available to the public since iOS 8.1.\nMy question is - is this a glitch or have other developers (consistently, and broadly) experienced the same thing? Will this storage space (and more importantly all the data I store in it - if I were to) go away suddenly? \nWould I be better off contacting Apple Support to make sure this error (if any) is corrected?\n\nA: This is part of the mail who sent apple regarding this:\n\nYour complimentary 50 GB of iCloud storage is expiring on November 1st and your account will be downgraded to your original storage plan. If you are using more storage than your original iCloud storage plan, you need to upgrade your plan or reduce the amount of storage you're using. You can view your storage used and upgrade your plan from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac. \n\nSo, it will expire in a few days.

I would like more space on my Ubuntu partition and need to therefore reduce the size of the Mac partition. I assume this will cause some damage to my Mac HD but I'm completely fine with that. The question however is; how in the world can we do this properly? The terminal diskutil gives me a very reasonable overview of the size of the complete HD and the partitions. iPartition for some reason spits out the unexplainable 85 gb as a current size and Macintosh's pride GUI the Disk Utility also is a bit out in the blue when it comes to what is actually on the total hard drive and how this is partitioned:\n\nAlso, adding the values of the independent disks doesn't total the space on the top disk.

You may shrink it down to the 82.68 GB which will render your OS X almost unusable because it needs some free space. You may disable the sleepimage and gain the amount of your RAM size as additional free space though.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Restart into Internet Recovery Mode by pressing cmdR\nor your bootable Mavericks Thumb Drive with iPartition installed.\n\n*start Terminal from the menubar/utilities\n\n*enter following command at the Terminal prompt: \n\n\n\ndiskutil cs list\n  \n*Copy the Logical Volume (LV) alphanumeric UUID of your CoreStorage volume. The LVUUID should be the fourth listed. In the above example the alphanumeric is:\n  4F26F5C3-8D94-419F-AFF1-B652E9DCDEF4.\n  \n*Run the following command:  \n\n\ndiskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID  \n\nAccording to the number found above it would be:  \n\ndiskutil cs resizeStack 4F26F5C3-8D94-419F-AFF1-B652E9DCDEF4 88g  \n\nThis will hopefully shrink your CoreStorage volume to 88 GB (skip to step 9 if this doesn't work)\n\n*If necessary reboot into your thumb drive and start iPartition. Alternatively you may use a Linux Live USB with gparted.\n\n*Try to move the volume Recovery HD to the end of the now shrinked Macintosh HD  (skip to step 9 if this doesn't work)\n\n*Expand your Ubuntu partition\n\n\n(2) total destruction (this will delete all partitions on your disk)\n\n\n*Disconnect all external hard drives\n\n*Restart into Internet Recovery Mode by pressing Command+R\n(alternatively you may use a Mavericks or Mountain Lion Install Thumb Drive)\n\n*start Terminal from the menubar/utilities\n\n*enter following command at the Terminal prompt: \n\n\n\ndiskutil cs list\n  \n*Copy the Logical Volume Group (LVG) alphanumeric UUID of your CoreStorage volume. The LVG UUID should be the first listed. In the above example the alphanumeric is:\n  08436957-C5CD-4DC6-B9FA-05B51A3EEFC8.\n  \n*Run the following command:  \n\n\ndiskutil cs delete LVGUUID  \n\nAccording to the number found above it would be:  \n\ndiskutil cs delete 08436957-C5CD-4DC6-B9FA-05B51A3EEFC8 \n\nThis will delete your CoreStorage volume and probably your Recovery HD and reformat it as a simple HFS+ volume.\n\n*Quit Terminal\n\n*In the now opening window choose Disk Utility erase all leftover partitions and format/partition/rename the internal drive. Choose 1 Partition, Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and GUID partition table (available with the option button). Quit Disk Utility.\n\n*Now choose 'Reinstall Mac OS X'\n\n*The originally shipped OS X will be downloaded and installed or the one provided with the aforementioned OS X Install Thumb Drive.\n\n*Set up your Mac\n\n*Download and install Mavericks/Yosemite from the App Store if necessary\n\n*Install Ubuntu (in a larger partition now)\n\n", "Q: Which IRC client stays online when in background? I tried some iOS IRC clients, but when I put the app in the background, I am logged out.\nAre there any iOS IRC clients that stay online when in background?\n\nA: An app called Colloquy can run in the background for up to 10 minutes on iOS 5.  No IRC app can run for more than 10 minutes in the background on iOS 5 due to how iOS is designed.  The Colloquy web site has an FAQ that explains:\n\nCan I run Mobile Colloquy in the background?\nYes, starting with Mobile Colloquy 1.3 & iOS 4.0 if you have an iPhone 4, 3GS, or a third-generation iPod touch (32GB and 64GB models from late 2009) you can, though it's important to understand how it works.\nDue to the way multitasking is implemented in iOS, Mobile Colloquy can't stay connected constantly. When you press the Home button or switch applications, Mobile Colloquy asks iOS to allow it to continue to run to complete a task in the background, that task being to keep you connected for as long as possible. Any highlight word mentions, or private messages you receive will trigger a notification while Colloquy is running in the background.\nTasks can only last a maximum of 10 minutes, so 9 minutes after you've switched away from Colloquy it'll warn you that you'll be disconnected in a minute. To continue to stay connected, just tap Open on the alert. Switching back to Colloquy before 10 minutes have elapsed, then switching away again will reset the countdown.\nFor more details on how multitasking works in iOS 4.0, see this ​excellent blog post from Craig Hockenberry.\n\n", "Q: Can VirtualBox prevent Mac OS X Yosemite to boot properly? After a few days of good experience with Yosemite, my Macbook pro cannot boot anymore. After 30 or 40% of boot, it just restarts. Here are what I did to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting to single-user, runnign fsck -fy, since the laptop fallen one day or two ago and I was suspicious about hard drive. But fsck told everything is fine with my hard drive. I don't think it is checking bad sectors.\n\n*Resetting PRAM\n\n*Booting to Recovery, checking hard disk via Disk Utilities\n\n*Reinstalling Yosemite from OS X Utilities\n\n\nNow it does not even boot into recovery (reboots after 30%).\nMy last try was to verbose boot, and the last message printed out before rebooting was:\nVBoxDrv: Failed to open kernel symbols (rc=-102)\n\nIn another try, the last message was:\nVBoxAdpDrv: version (some number)\n\nI had VirtualBox installed on my MacBook and worked prior to upgrading to Yosemite (in Mavericks). I did not check it in Yosemite.\nSo my question is: can VirtualBox prevent Yosemite from boot? Can I uninstall it using single-user boot (which is the only successful boot on my computer now)? Or do you have a better idea to get it fixed?\n\nA: Finally I found a serious hardware error (failure of main board) was preventing installation of Yosomite. The reason I saw Virtual Box error was just a matter of chance, it printed out the lost error message before the computer crashed due to the main board error\n", "Q: Regarding geotagged photos I am using an iPhone 4 and I have many photos taken in different locations. Now I am planning to get a new iPhone 6. Can I sync these photos to my new phone? If so, can I see the locations on the new phone?\n\nA: The geolocation of each photo is stored inside the photo file itself, and goes with the photo when it is transferred to a computer or another device. This information will remain visible after being transferred onto your new phone.\n", "Q: Notes Plus app not working for some reason the toolbar that is normally at the top of my notes plus app is at the bottom and the shade that you pull up so your palm doesn't Touch the glass is on the top. What can I do to straighten this out?\n\nA: If your tool bar appears across the bottom of your \"notes plus\" app ,simply tap the picture of the wrench  down in the right-hand corner.Several pictures of hands showing ways to hold your stylus will appear. You simply choose one and a bar will then return to the top.\n", "Q: Unable to convert dmg to encrypted dmg on Yosemite When I try to convert a regular (internet downloaded) dmg file to an encrypted dmg (256-bit AES) using Disk Utility on Yosemite it gives me this error message:\n How do I get this to work on Yosemite? If not via Disk Utility, is there a way to convert it using Terminal commands? I was aways able to do this on Mavericks, but after I upgraded to Yosemite I get the above error message. I'm sure that the dmg isn't corrupted as I downloaded AirSquirel's Reflector trial dmg, tried to convert and I got the same error message. If it helps I'm using a Mid-2013 MacBook Air.\n\nA: I've figured it out! Though still appears that converting a dmg file to an encrypted one using Disk Utility is still broken as of OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), I've figured out a way to do it via terminal using this:\nhdiutil convert /PATH/TO/FILE -format UDZO -encryption AES-256 -o /OUTPUT/FILE\n\nThis converts a dmg using AES-256 encryption and uses zlib compression. I hope that Apple fixes this in Yosemite soon though. I got some inspiration/help from this Super User question: Further compressions of disk image files\n", "Q: Finder on Yosemite misbehaves: doubled text, blank windows, lack of updates Since updating to Yosemite, Finder has been acting strangely. I can usually get it to show a normal-looking and -behaving window for a few operations, and then the window will either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be blank, showing no files or folders where I know it is pointing at a non-empty folder.\n\n*Show prior state, rather than the state I know to be true now. For instance, I could delete a folder, but it still shows as present, even after forcing Finder to refresh the view somehow.\n\n*Double the labels under the finder item:\n\nThe only third-party extensions showing in the \"Extensions\" system pref pane are Dropbox and PCalc.\nI've read that old versions of Rogue Amoeba's \"Instant On\" feature can cause Yosemite problems, but I'm on the current version, 8.0.2.\nI can fix it temporarily by dropping to the Terminal and saying killall Finder.\n\nA: You have to make a PRAM reset.\nTo do that restart your Mac, and BEFORE the \"Bong\" press ALL the following keys, until you hear the \"Bong\" again : cmd + alt + P + R\nAfter your can let your Mac start normally.\nIf the problem persist, redo the manipulation but stay your finger on the key until you have hear the \"Bong\" 5 times.\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X keeping constant track of my processes? I own a 13-inch Mid 2012 MacBook Pro with a 2.5GHz i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, running OS X 10.9.5. I came to notice a while ago, that after having forced a reboot (by holding down the ⌽ Power button) the system asks if you want to restore the windows that it previously had open.\nI'm just baffled by this. Does this mean the system is keeping a constant track of everything I open and close? I mean, if it does, this surely has a performance impact (which I happen to have noticed actually).\nMy question is then, is there any sort of configuration that I can tinkle to make it stop doing this in the hopes of getting it run faster?\n\nA: Simplified explanation: When an application is started, an entry is written to disk that says this app is currently active. When an application quits, that entry is removed. When the system starts and finds entries in this list, it's an indicator that the system crashed or did not shut down properly and it can offer to relaunch those apps for you. It takes virtually no practical overhead at all to track this.\nEach application individually may also be tracking which documents you opened pretty much the same way and then reopen your documents when it is being launched. There's no need to \"constantly track the state of everything\", the system just needs to make a few notes here and there when key events happen (such as an application launching or quitting).\n\nA: You are misreading the \"restore the windows that it previously had open\".- it means applications that were open prior pushing the Power button to shut down.\nIt definitely knows what applications are open at the any time.\nSo it is simply asking you if you want those applications reopen.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for switching between buttons in a dialog I was wondering if there is a way, like using the Tab key, to switch with the keyboard between buttons on a dialog box, where a program asks for a decision? (Example below)\n\n\nA: Tab is supposed to work (and does), but Yosemite seems to have a bug in regard to highlighting which button is selected. The entire button being blue means the button is the default, but there should also be a visual indicator of which button is selected.\nYou can test that Tab does in fact work. Press Cmd+S to save the page you are looking at right now. Then, in the Save sheet, press Shift+Tab twice, and press Spacebar. The Save sheet will disappear because you selected the Cancel button and executed it (with the Spacebar).\nBecause of the lack of a visual indicator, unfortunately this is going to be difficult to use until the visual bug is fixed.\n", "Q: After Yosemite, can't print; CUPS error_log: \"/bin/bash: gs: command not found\" My printer stopped working since I upgraded to Yosemite.

I need to test a web application with JRE 6. I am using a Mac with OS X 10.10 and Java 7 for development. How can I install JRE 6 next to Java 7 on this Mac? \nThis previous answer does not yet account for the fact (also mentioned in a comment) that Apple's download link by now points to a .pkg (Java for OS X 2014-001) file. Without further knowledge I hasten to install it, for it may overwrite my current Java 7 setup (and may no longer contain JRE 6 in the first place).\n\nA: As noted by @klanomath \"No file will be overwritten\": You can have multiple JDK's installed but only one JRE. But each JDK also comes with a JRE. \nApple's Java integration with OS X provides /usr/libexec/java_home that can help you keep the JDK situation straight. That selects among the JDK's and their associated JRE found in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. See the man java_home page. \nHowever there is no equivalent capability to select among versions of the JRE accessed via /Library/Internet Plug-ins/ http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202643 provides the only 'official' way to select among those, which requires terminal savvy with sudo and symbolic links. Since you are a developer testing web apps one assumes that will suffice, but not something mere mortals want to mess around with.\n\nA: JavaForOSX2014-001.dmg contains Java for Mac OS X (1.6.0_65-b14-462).

No file will be overwritten.\nTo avoid any trouble (especially with your $JAVA_HOME/$PATH) consider setting up a Mac OS X VM in VMWare, Parallels or VirtualBox with JRE6 only.\n", "Q: Trying to get Hadoop to work; \"connection refused\" in Hadoop and in Telnet I was trying to get Hadoop working in standalone mode on my MBP (OS 10.9.5), but I kept getting \"connection refused\" errors. I found that telnet localhost 9000 gives the same error, which is what I was told to try as a diagnostic. The same thing happens if I try 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, or if I try ftp instead of telnet. However ping localhost and ssh localhost work fine.\nI had messed around a while ago with setting up an Apache server, and I'm concerned I might have broken something. At some point, I had apparently added the line:\n127.0.0.1    test.local\n\nto /etc/hosts. I also had modified httpd.conf to use the folder ~/test as my DocumentRoot, and had changed to extra/httpd-vhosts.conf as well.\nI restored the original httpd* files from the /etc/apache2/original folder, and I restored the /etc/hosts file to its original state. apachectl configtest gives me:\nhttpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using <username>.local for ServerName\nSyntax OK\n\nSo what do I do? How can I get my computer to stop refusing the connection? I don't know much about networking or servers.\n\nFor completeness, here's the original telnet error:\n$ ssh localhost\n$ telnet localhost 9000\nTrying ::1...\ntelnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused\nTrying fe80::1...\ntelnet: connect to address fe80::1: Connection refused\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host\n\nand my /etc/hosts file:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

As it is your cluster, only you can find out and track down the problem.\n\nand indeed I fail on the second-to-last step, which apparently should work; hence this question.\n\nA: It's normal getting conection refused if you ftp or telnet to localhost, at least if you haven't up and running that kind of servers, and by default, you don't.\nThe /etc/hosts should look like 127.0.0.1 localhost by default. To use apache and avoid the error you mentioned, you must add ServerName  localhost to httpd.conf. Restart apache and should works fine.\nDon't know if this solve Hadoop error too. Can't help you on it. Just try and let me know.\n\nA: It turns out I had \"Remote Login\" disabled in System Preferences!\nThe solution was:\n\nSystem Preferences -> Sharing -> Check the \"Remote Login\" box\n\nAlthough I also reformatted by hard drive and upgraded to Yosemite, so having a fresh version of Apache probably helped too.\n\nA: Sometimes this exception is thrown when one starts hadoop without starting the namenode, so before you run sbin/start-dfs.sh it is advisable to run:\nbin/hdfs namenode\n\nGood luck.\n\nA: I am also getting same error while running hadoop dfs -ls\n<HOSTNAME> to 0.0.0.0:9000 failed on connection\nexception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; \nFor more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused\n\nFor me it was problem with permission issue; run hadoop namenode -format and check if you are getting below exception:\njava.io.IOException: Cannot create directory /usr/local/hadoop/dfs/name/current\njava.io.IOException: Cannot create directory /usr/local/hadoop/dfs/name/current\n\nIf you are getting above exception; give write permission ; \n\n\n*\n\n*Stop hadoop\n\n*sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/hadoop/dfs/name/\n\n*Start hadoop\n\n*hadoop namenode -format to verify\n\n", "Q: How can I see which QuickLook plugin is responsible for which data type? Sometimes, QuickLook doesn't work right with certain file types, even though it should. Or a file now looks different in QuickLook than it used to.\nHow to find out which QuickLook plugin, or .qlgenerator, is responsible for which types, and what to do about it?\n\nA: Open Terminal, and type the following:\nqlmanage -m plugins\n\nThis will give you a fairly long list of all your active QuickLook plugins:\n\nThe types listed there might look a little strange, like com.apple.safari.bookmark. Those are Apple Uniform Type Identifiers or short UTType identifiers, and there is a list of the default ones available from Apple here. If you're looking for a specific file extension, it might be a good idea to open that link and search the page for it. A search for txt reveals its UTType to be public.plain-text, and this is the type you will find it under in the qlmanage output.\nSo if a particular type of file looks strange in QuickLook, just look up its path here, go there and disable it (for instance by renaming its file extension to something other than qlgenerator), then come back to Terminal and force QuickLook to reload its list of plugins by typing\nqlmanage -r\n\nRun qlmanage -m plugins again to make sure the offending qlgenerator is not loaded anymore. Careful: QuickLook will even load them if they're in the trash, which is why we renamed the plugin above instead of trashing it.\nOpen a Finder window, find a file of the right type, and hit the space bar to double-check.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro unusable when HDMI output is connected My new MacBook Pro Retina 13″ (OS X 10.10) gets completely unusable when I attach the HDMI cable to the HDMI port.\nI have noticed that there are few processes that will start to consume crazy memory.\nIn particular \"SystemUIServer\" process, around 65 GB RAM (which I do not even have from an hardware perspective), and the \"kernel_task\" process several GBs of memory usage.\nThe problem is that the resolution of the screen is changed once the HDMI cable is plugged and, even after killing the SystemUIServer, if i try to open the monitor settings to change the resolution this task will hang for ever making the usage of the laptop connected with the beamer impossible.\nI have tried to search on internet but seems that no one has got the same problem.\n\nA: \nThe following facts are relevant to the workaround.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*A separate copy of SystemUIServer runs on behalf of each user, owned by that user, when the user has a GUI login. This is very convenient because it means we can kill this program without requiring passwords and suchlike.\n  \n*SystemUIServer appears to have been very nicely cordoned off by Apple from the rest of the system so that you can kill it at any time and nothing bad happens. The menulings all disappear, then launch restarts SystemUIServer, and the menulings all reappear (in a much smaller memory environment).\n  \n*So the simple one-off solution to the problem is to type in Terminal: \n  killall SystemUIServer. And this works, but only once --- you will need to do it again in a week or so.\n  \n*The possibility I chose is to have launchd execute this command once a day, at a time when I'm probably not using the machine, namely 4:00am. (If your machine is asleep at that time, launchd in Snow Leopard performs the task when the machine is wakes up, and this works out OK --- we see just one more flash in the UI as the menulings are killed then restart, to accompany the various other flashes in the UI that occur when a wake occurs.\n  \n\nSource: Handle growing SystemUIServer memory usage\n", "Q: Treat fullscreen as desktop spaces in the matter of navigation As the title says, I'd like to treat an app fullscreen as a desktop in the matter of navigation in Yosemite 10.10. \nI’am working with 2 monitors + 3 apps in fullscreen mode and do a lot with the keyboard. My problem is that I often want to change the focus between the monitors or between two fullscreen apps of one monitor. My question is, is there a shortcode for changing the focus between different spaces?\nI know that you can change the focus between each app/space by \n\n\n*\n\n*walking through apps with  cmd + tab\n\n*cmd + arrows to switch to neighboring spaces\n\n*ctrl + number to change to a specific desktop (not fullscreen spaces)\n\n\nWhat I want is a ctrl + number shortcode not only for additional desktops, but for fullscreen apps, too. Precisely a space addressing shortcode and not only a desktop addressing shortcode.\nIf there isn’t a solution for that, just changing the focus from one monitor to the other would be enough. At moment I always have to move the mouse to the other screen or use cmd+tab which is annoying when you have a few apps open.\n\nA: Did you consider using Keyboard Maestro?\nHere you can see how I deal with something this. I use it to move cursor and windows between screens, but is really easy to modify per your requests.\n", "Q: How to restore the Mavericks version of the sound effect for the volume button for Yosemite? I just upgraded my MacBook to Yosemite, and the new sound effect for the volume button is just awful. Is there a way to change out the sound file so I can hear the old version on Yosemite?\n\nA: It can be done, although you need to find the Mavericks volume feedback sound file. The filename is \"volume.aiff\" and (for both Mavericks and Yosemite) it is located in:\n/System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources\nFind the Mavericks volume feedback sound file and put it on your Desktop for easy access.\nOpen the Terminal and navigate to the folder containing the sound file:\ncd /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources\n\nCreate a backup of the original file in case you want to reverse the changes:\nsudo cp volume.aiff volume.aiff.bak\n\nProvide the password when prompted.\nNow copy in the Mavericks sound file placed on your Desktop:\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/volume.aiff ./\n\nRestart\n\nA: This works perfectly AFTER you boot into recovery (by holding CMD+R at boot up).\nFrom there open Terminal (under the Utilities menu) and enter csrutil disable (to disable System Integrity Protection). \nOnce you do that there are no issues though I would recommend you repeat the above process when done and enter csrutil enable into Terminal to enable System Integrity Protection.\n", "Q: Can I transfer an app to somebody else without having them to pay for developer enrollment? I am an app developer, and I have to transfer an app to a company, so the app won't have my name under the title in the AppStore. So it looks like they made it. My question is, do they have to pay for an enrollment, or can they just recieve the app for free, and if they can, how can they recieve it from me? I know you can transfer it from itunes connect, but it seems to me that you have to pay for an enrollment to get access to itunes connect. \n\nA: Yes, the receiving company will need an Apple Developer ID and membership of the Mac and/or iOS Developer Programs.\nPart of the process of enrolling involves agreeing to Apple's terms of service and other legally binding agreements. Without agreeing to Apple's agreements, the receiving company will not be able to participate in Apple's App Store or Mac App Store.\nIt is possible to have applications associated with your Apple Developer ID but not participate in the App Stores. However, those applications will not be eligible for sale through Apple.\n", "Q: What does \"main screen\" actually refer to, in battery usage? On iOS 8, there is the battery usage screen showing an estimate of the battery use, per application.\nIt also has an entry for \"Main screen\". I assumed it was just displaying the main screen with the icons, but I got 40% of that during night, during which the screen was indeed off.\nAs such, what does \"Main screen\" refer to, exactly?\n\nA: From https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/#ios:\n\nHome & Lock Screen. This indicates that the Home screen or Lock screen\n  was displayed on your device. For example, the display was awakened by\n  pressing the Home button or by a notification.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If an app frequently wakes your display with notifications, you can turn off push notifications for the app in Settings > Notifications.\n  Tap App and set Allow Notifications to Off.\n  \n\n", "Q: Will App Store programs download when I'm on a different user than the one that started? I'm using Mac OS X 10.7.5, and I'd like to know this. I started the download for OS X Yosemite yesterday on User A, accidentally - I was going to start it on User B (me). Now, I didn't notice this until I switched to User B and let the computer sleep so that it could download the update while still staying alive (I plugged it in, too).\nNow, when I woke up this morning, and switched back to User A, I got a couple of funny things happening.\nFirst of all, it said Could not download OS X Mountain Lion due to an unknown error; the application can be found in Purchases in the App Store in a dialog window. Not cool, but I wasn't even downloading OS X Mountain Lion!\nNext, when I clicked F4 on my Macbook Pro to see my Launchpad, OS X MAVERICKS was in there and paused. \nFinally, Yosemite seemed to be still downloading; there was a Yosemite button icon thing, and it said downloading.\nThis brings me to my question: Yosemite didn't seem to have downloaded at all. It was still at the first progress bar image (or so it seemed). So, is it supposed to not download when I'm not in the same user as the one which started the download?\nI'd really like to know this, because my internet downloads at 300 KBpS on average, and it's really slow, so I'd like to not be wasting time on getting the download to work when it's not going to work at all. \n\nA: The App Store saves its files to a temporary folder until it is completely downloaded.  This temporary download location is different for each user of the Mac.  So, it's possible (likely) that you could have two partially downloaded copies of the same application.  For Yosemite, and its multi-gb package size, this is not trivial.\nYou can see if the file is currently downloading in a number of ways.  2 & 3 require some familiarity with Terminal.app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the incoming data bandwidth with Activity Monitor\n\n*Search for any open files held by the AppStore agent via sudo lsof | grep storeage\n\n*Check to see if the file size of anything in /var/folders/XX/XXXXXXXX/C/com.apple.appstore/* is changing.  You can find the exact path (up to the C) via getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR for the currently logged-in user.\n\n*If the app is downloading, mouse-over the Launchpad icon in the dock should show a %done status.  (I've seen this behave erratically; so, although it's the simplest, I'm listing it last)\n", "Q: How do I transfer pictures from iPhoto to iCloud Drive? I have 17000 pictures in my iPhoto library. How do I transfer them to iCloud Drive?\n\nA: Find the location of your iPhoto library (usually in ~/Pictures) and move it to the iCloud Drive folder in Finder. Once the library has moved, you can switch library in iPhoto by launching iPhoto with ⌥, then selecting the new library location.\n\nA: All your contents inside the iCloud Drive can be accessed from your iphone. Just click on icloud drive in your iphone and you can see everything, including your pictures. \n\nA: As of Feb 2021, I tried moving my Photo library into iCloud Drive, and I see \"Ineligible\"\n\n\n", "Q: Mac mini connected display not showing full screen I just got the new Mac Mini and plugged in my display, but it's not showing the full screen. \nHere's how it looks like:\n\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Displays and adjust the Overscan slider (or checkbox, depending on the screen model) so the content fits on the screen. Alternatively, you should be able to change the settings on the display itself to adjust the overscan.\nFor more information on overscan and underscan, see the Apple KB article:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5841\n", "Q: mDNSResponder missing I am on Yosemite since today and am trying to connect to network printers, but System Preferences doesn't show any. The printers use Bonjour and I read that the associated process is mDNSresponder. Checking Activity Monitor I see it is not running. Googling how to manually restart it reveals tips such as these.\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\nHowever, the .plist file does not exist, neither does /usr/sbin/mDNSResponder.\nThe thing is that the printer problem existed even before I upgraded from 10.7.5 to 10.10, so I cannot judge whether this is a Yosemite issue or not, or wether the mDNSResponder stuff is even the source. I also don't know if I had the files before (although at some point I must have).\nHow do I enable Bonjour on Yosemite?\n\nA: mDNSResponder was replaced by DiscoveryUtil in Yosemite. So Bonjour is still enabled. According to this Apple-kb article you might have to download updated printer drivers from Apple or the original manufacturer or re-add your printer with a different set up.\nIf you still have problems discovering your printer an Apple-discussion-thread might help:  unblock discoveryd in the firewall preferences and an immediate reboot...\n", "Q: Running a script with assets inside automator application So, I'm trying to write an automator application that runs a simple script.\npython Contents/main.py\n\nwhere Contents is the contents of the .app.\nWhen the script is run it is run in ~ not in the working directory (wherever the file is placed on a system).\nIs there a way to do this?\nNote: I am not taking any input to the application, you just double click it.\nThanks,\nHarry\n\nA: You can get the path to Your executable from ps command. You need to know Your app name. Here's my code with EchoPath.app made in Automator:\nDIR=`ps x | grep EchoPath | grep -v grep | cut -c 28- `\n\nSample output:\n/Users/slozo/Desktop/EchoPath.app/Contents/MacOS/Application Stub\n\nApplication Stub is the default name of the executable created in Automator. Knowing this path You can get the path to Contents dir with dirname command.\n", "Q: How to copy videos wireless from Mac to iPhone? (wireless) I'd like to add some videos to my iPhone (from my Mac or PC), but I don't want to be restricted in video players (Infuse, Nplayer, etc).\nI think I need to copy them into the iPhone Video Library so all video players can access it, but how can I do this wirelessly?\n\nA: If you don't regularly sync with your phone with your computer, the easiest way might be to use the Dropbox app. I'm copying my answer from a previous question:\n\nThe easiest way is to use Dropbox (you have Dropbox right?). Put the photo in your Dropbox, go to the same folder using the Dropbox app on your phone, click on the video, click the little share button in bottom left, and then choose \"Save Video.\"\n\nNote that videos are generally pretty large in file size. You should probably be connected to wifi on the phone before attempting to do this.\n", "Q: iMac eventually crashing after memory upgrade I have an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2010) running on two pairs of brand new VALUESELECT Corsair memories - 4 slots, 4GB each.\nOSX (both Mountain Lion and Yosemite) is detecting available memory accordingly - 16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3.

Yosemite After updating two distinct Macs (a MacBook Air and a Mac Mini, both using the same iCloud account) from Mavericks to Yosemite, I noticed the following weird bug:\nAll keyboard shortcuts in Safari and Firefox (not in Chrome, nor in any other app I've tried) have stopped working. When using a shortcut in Firefox, the corresponding spot on the menu bar is briefly highlighted (for instance, ⌘T flashes File), but nothing else happens; in Safari, not even this menubar flashing occurs.\nWeirdest of all: on both browsers, if I first open a menu by clicking on the menubar, then any shortcut works (while the menu is open).\nQuestion: Has anyone else encountered this bug? What would you recommend? Should I notify Apple somehow?\n\nA: I have had this exact problem for weeks, and it's been driving me crazy, but I've finally found a solution. I found this thread on the Apple Support Communities, where “stevendeluxe” says the following:\n\nProblem fixed!\n  I compared the system preferences for each user and found out that I had several languages activated in the language/region settings. So I deleted the language adding the option \"list sort order\". This option wasn't activated in my test account.\nYou have to try which language is the \"bad one\" on your system (In my case it was \"german\"...haha) and delete it. UPDATE: I've tried to re-add the deleted language and still safari works fine.\n\nI did the same, went to “Language & Region” in OS X System Preferences (found in the Apple menu at the top left of the screen), and removed two languages I'd added as a lark (Swiss German and Klingon, to be precise), and after restarting the computer (which OS X requires if you remove the primary language), all my keyboard shortcuts work again. Joy and jubilation. \nI hope this works for you, too.\n\nA: My problem was Command-Shift-Option-V (Paste and Match Style) which would just give me right-pointing double angle quotation mark ('»').\nPer my experience there may be at least three things that might have something to do with this apparent bug (2011 Early MBP with SSD and did a clean Yosemite install by the way if anyone's wondering).\n\n\n*\n\n*You have only one system language selected (in my case a minor language like Finnish).\n\n*You only have created a single user account.\n\n*You log in automatically.\n\n\nMerely adding and setting English as a primary system language didn't solve this issue.\nIt seems that only after I had created a new temporary user account, logged in with that user AND/OR optioned out to log in automatically, things finally went back to normal.\nThe bug didn't return after I had deleted English system language and switched back to Finnish. Nor when I deleted the temporary new user account. Or when I reverted back to automatic log in.\nFor future reference I think it may be a wise decision to hold on to the English system language (even if you will never use it)...\n\nA: Yes I have the same problem. Not all shortcuts are affected but the most useful and ordinary ones (cut copy and paste for example) are. Really irritating as I prefer using keyboard shortcuts\n\nA: I see this problem with Firefox version 34.0.5 on Snow Leopard.  For me, the non-working function is \"Email Link...\" on the File menu.  I created a keyboard shortcut for that item.  When I press the shortcut, the File menu blinks, but the desired function does not fire.  However, when I click to open the File menu first, and then press the shortcut combination, the item is activated.\nThe language-related fixes suggested previously have no effect in this instance.\n\nA: System Preferences -> Language & Region -> Keyboard Preferences -> Keyboard ->  select the \"Use all F1, F2, etc...\" This toggles between the normal and the special features of the Function keys. \n", "Q: Clearing NVRAM on Yosemite shows password entry When I make the ⌘ Cmd+⌥ Opt+P+R it shows a dialog with lock symbol and to proceed I have to give the password but this way I'm not able to proceed with the resetting of the PRAM.

What is the most simple way (for a non-techie) to back up my text messages, including the pictures within iMessages?\n\nA: I believe that the right way on doing that is with an iTunes Back-up. This way you make sure you can restore them back to your device anytime you want without loosing any of them including the images.\nAlso there are few apps out there that could help you export the messages, but not sure if they can be imported back to your device. For example using an app for Mac called iExplorer.\n\nA: iTunes backup (to the desktop) creates SQLite database on your local hard drive.

The backend works by forwarding the print data to another machine (using ssh) and feeding the data to the printer from there.  For this to work, the backend (implemented as a shell script), needs access to an ssh private key.  Problem: since I upgraded to Yosemite, the script can no longer access the file containing the key.  Instead I see the following error message on the console:\nsandboxd: [...] deny file-read-data /\n\nand\n/usr/libexec/cups/backend/.mybackend-ssh/id_dsa: Permission denied\n\nin the CUPS error log file.\nHow can I inject a file into the sandbox used to isolate CUPS backends?\n\nA: While this doesn't answer the question, I stumbled across this - http://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/MacOS1010YosemiteKnownIssues - when trying to get Tea4CUPS working in OS X 10.10 (I was not able to achieve this):\n\nTo get PaperCut working with Mac OS 10.10 in the interim, you’ll need to disable sandboxing. Edit the file /etc/cups/cups-files.conf to include the new line ‘Sandboxing Relaxed’. Then restart CUPS for this to take effect.\n\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"Sandboxing Relaxed\" >> /etc/cups/cups-files.conf'\nsudo launchctl stop org.cups.cupsd\n\n\nA: After a long debugging session, I have finally solved this problem.  In case other people run into the same difficulties, here is what I learned about CUPS backends under Mac OS X Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backends are executable files (in my case, a shell script) in the /usr/libexec/cups/backend/ directory.  Information about the print job is passed into these programs via command line arguments ($1=job-id, $2=user, $3=title, $4=copies, $5=options, $6=file) and environment variables (e.g. $DEVICE_URI).\n\n*Backends are executed as user _lp, group _lp, with permissions further restricted by sandboxd.  The current directory when the backend is started is the root directory /, but the backend does not have permission to read this directory.  Directories which can be read include /usr/libexec/cups/backend/, \n/etc/ and subdirectories thereof.  Only very restricted (or none at all?) access to the home directory of user _lp (in /var/spool/cups) is permitted.\n\n*My backend requires use of ssh.  For this to work, ssh needs to be able to access the private key required to log into the remote server, and a known_hosts file which identifies the remote server.  The required key can be placed in /usr/libexec/cups/backend/ or a subdirectory, it must be only readable by the user _lp.  It seems that ssh, when started from the CUPS backend, has no permission to access /var/spool/cups/.ssh/, even if this directory exists; thus the known_hosts file must be stored in /etc/, as /etc/ssh_known_hosts.  (Note that the ssh manual page incorrectly claims that this should be /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.)\nEdit: On MacOS X 10.11 (El Capitan), ssh now seems to use\nthe documented location /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts for the known\nhosts file.  I had to move my file into /etc/ssh/ to make the printer filter\nwork after the OS upgrade.\n\n*To debug issues like this, using cupsctl --debug-logging is invaluable:  After this command is issued, everything written to stderr in the CUPS backend appears in /var/log/cups/error_log.  Logging can be switched off again using cupsctl --no-debug-logging.  In addition, whenever sandboxd denies an attempted file access, a message like sandboxd[426] ([15998]): sh(15998) deny file-read-data / can be found in /var/log/system.log.\n", "Q: iPhoto iPhone photo import cache folder? If I connect an iPhone to my Mac (any iPhone, whether one that is synced with my library or not), iPhoto will open and directly show the photos stored on this iPhone and allows to \"Import Selected\".\nWithout selecting any of the pictures, does iPhoto somewhere store the thumbnails that it displays on this screen?\nIf so, where is this cache folder on OS X?\nThe reason I'm asking is that I connected a foreign iPhone and iPhoto popped up displaying the photos stored on the device and I want to erase any image data that potentially got transferred to my Mac.\n\nA: Inside your iPhoto Library is a folder named Caches. This folder contains temporary thumbnails generated in circumstances such as a pending import. You can delete the contents of this directory, although iPhoto should manage it itself.\n", "Q: Folder locations for macOS app I am porting an application from Windows and Linux to macOS. \nThe application is written in Qt. It has a few dependent dylib (some built, some sdk). The exact same libraries and same Qt version are used for some other applications (which are not ready to be ported yet). It will not be distributed through the App Store.\nThe application can read, write, drag-and-drop, print custom type user files. It uses a sqlite3 database, provided - users should be able to browse to its location (since they should also have the ability to use a database from a different location). During print, it would be best to use the cups temporary folder to save temporary bitmap files.\nI have tried to figure out the best way to install this type of app. Is the bundle packaging right for this type of app, or should I use the file system to place all required files in the most likely locations?\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a bundle so far, I have the dependencies (including Qt\nframeworks) inside the Contents/Frameworks directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where would I place the user created files... inside the bundle or inside the Users/MyCompany/MyProgram directory? I tried to save inside... can't browse inside the MyApp.app from inside the program. \n\n*Where would I place the sqlite3 database? If I place it inside the bundle (e.g. Contents/Resources), I cannot access it from inside the program. \n\n*Where would the entire bundle be installed? in /Applications/MyCompany/MyProduct is my guess?\n\n\n*Without a bundle: from what I read, the following may be good locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*For the executable:  /Applications as above? \n\n*For the dependent libs: usr/share/MyCompany/MyProduct or\n/Library/MyCompany/MyProduct ? \n\n*User files obviously\nUsers/MyCompany/MyProgram \n\n*Resource database ? I have no idea what a\ngood place is, accessible to all users, where to keep such a file\n\n*This setup would allow other applications to be installed and use the\nsame Qt framework and dependent dylibs... But I read something about\napps not working if the dylibs are modified ?\n\n\n\nWhich is the best way and in that case, which are the best folder locations?\nShould I assume that the installation is made with sudo rights? Can the installation be done without admin rights?\n\nA: The application bundle should go in /Applications. This application bundle should contain everything. Libraries, dependencies, everything that the app needs to run, so that should the application bundle be copied to another machine's /Applications directory, it should be able to run.\nInstalling in /Applications requires admin. Should admin not be available, the standard location for a single user application is ~/Applications. This directory should not be expected to exist.\nIf something needs to be 'installed' on the system for the app, such as the aforementioned 'resource database', the app should prompt to install it in:\n/Library/Application Support/developername/appname/\n\nShould something need to be 'installed' for the current user, it should go in the same path prefixed with their home directory. This doesn't require admin.\n~/Library/Application Support/developername/appname/\n\nUser files should not be saved in the root of the user's home directory. The user should have the opportunity to save files wherever they please, preferably with a standard OS X save dialog.\nAlso…\n\n\n*\n\n*Cache files should go in:\n~/Library/Caches/developername/appname/\n\n\n*The users preferences should go in:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.bundleidentifier.plist\n\nIf something more than a single property list needs to be saved…\n~/Library/Preferences/developername/appname/\n\n", "Q: Paste format/style only?

My mid-2009 17\" Macbook running Mavericks is running really slow and constantly freezes. I went to Disk Utility and ran \"Repair Disk,\" but after about 3 minutes it said: \"Disk utility can't repair thsi disk, Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\"\nI have already ran Time Machine for back-up but I'm afraid that some expensive Applications, specifically Adobe Master Collection CS5, Max/MSP, and Ableton Live will lose their product keys / licenses when I whip my drive? I don't have any of that information written down, so I'd have to find it on my Macbook somewhere.\nWill Time Machine back that up, or do I need to find the product keys and serial numbers? If so, where are they stored?\n\nA: You might lose them. According to this thread on Adobe's forums, other users experienced issues with restoring an entire drive from Time Machine. It looks like, from some cursory research, that the plist files or FlexNet folders don't get restored (even if they are present in the backup), and that Adobe's recommendations are to delicense before restoring and then relicense it after restoring.\nYou will need to locate your original licenses and identify each manufacturer's process for relicensing after a restoration.\n", "Q: Can I delete things safely from ~/Library? I am running out of storage space on my 2011 MacBook Air. I was thinking I should clean up before I contemplate adding more storage.\nI notice though, that while I have ~30 GB in ~/Documents, ~2 in ~/Movies, ~10 ~/Pictures, I also have ~70 GB in the ~/Library folder.\nWhat can I safely delete (if anything), and what is the best method to delete from this folder?\nHere is the result of the cd ~/Library; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16 script:\n46559   Developer\n26874   Application Support\n23941   Mail\n4822    Containers\n2030    MobileDevice\n1524    Logs\n1430    Caches\n1371    iTunes\n1032    Mobile Documents\n229     Safari\n65      Dragon Profile.ddictateprofile\n40      Keychains\n35      Preferences\n33      Internet Plug-Ins\n29      Mail Downloads\n26      Autosave Information\n\n\nA: To see which folders inside ~/Library use most of the space, run something like\ncd ~/Library; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16\n\nin Terminal which gives you the 16 folders using the most space.\nSpecific cleanup actions afterwards depend on the folders found.\n\nA: This question is a bit old now, but I figured I'd add my experience for googling.\nWhile developing BLE applications on 10.11.x versions of Mac OS, I often found that I had to clear BLE data from ~/Library in order to return to a pre-connected/paired state on server (not client) devices.\nI began experimenting with ~/Library to reduce bloat on a system where HDD space was running low. Having planned on performing a fresh install anyway, I further experimented by rming the entire ~/Library directory and rebooting. I didn't expect that the system would return to an operational state.\nUpon boot I had to log back into iCloud, set up Slack, set preferences on keyboard, trackpad, terminal, browser, programs, etc.. \nThe system survived and is still running great. After all settings were back in place, a df -h showed that I reclaimed about 16GB.\nI understand that this could be a hugely risky move depending on what applications are installed and your level of comfort with losing data/time. In my case the user account was not valued and the machine was pending complete format. However, with it being a somewhat loaded dev machine, I was surprised to find that the system was surprisingly tolerant of the complete removal of ~/Library.\n\nA: I had a huge (300gb+) ~Library. The culprit was Steam games that were living in /Users/_myusername_/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common.\nTo figure out what games were taking up the most space and remove them:\n\n*\n\n*I jumped into my library: cd ~/Library/\"Application Support\"/Steam/steamapps/common\n\n*Figured out the biggest files: du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16\n\n*Opened the Steam application and deleted those games which then removed the files.\n\nWhat a pain.\n\nA: ~/Library is where all your apps store their prefs, how you want them to work for you.\nIt would generally be unwise to start playing in there without being certain of what you are doing....\nThat said, some apps can store large cache files in there, others may be folders for apps you long-since deleted - those would be safe candidates.\n70GB is a pretty big lib, btw, mine is only 30GB & I'm a heavy user.\nI'd still be very, very careful in there, but maybe try something like Grand Perspective to see what the largest users are. (There's another similar tool I can't right now remember the name of. If someone remembers & drops it in comments, that would be very nice)\nAnother way to hone down the largest users would be...\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the ~/Library folder, set to List View\n\n*Hit Cmd/J for View Options & set to 'Calculate all sizes' [this may take a while]\n\n*Back in the ~/Lib folder, set to sort by Size from the column headers.\n\n*Application Support is usually the largest by quite some margin, so \n\n*Cmd/double click that & repeat the process...\n\n\nA: If you’ve deleted applications/programs, and they have leftovers in the Library/Application Support/ folder, then it is probably safe to clean out that program’s Library/Application Support/ subfolder. If, for example, I wanted to remove Firefox’s old data after uninstalling, I would go to Finder’s search box and type firefox. Make sure the search is set to This Mac, then click the plus button underneath the search box to add System Files and are included. You’ll get a mix of small files and directories as a result (ideally). The folders are what you want to focus on. Clicking on a folder should show its path at the bottom of the finder window. If a Firefox folder is in USER/Library/Application Support/ I just delete the folder. Deleting the folder will also delete its content, so you may see your total number of search results drop as a consequence.\nThat being said, be careful. If in doubt, don’t delete it without referring to that programs documentation.\n\nA: From what is in /System/Library/User Template/Library, here is what ~/Library contains when you create a brand new user.\nAlmost all entries are empty directories.\nTherefore, you can safely delete everything in ~/Library.

I have an Android phone and an iPod Touch.  The camera on the iPod Touch is front-facing and much better than the one on the Android, and with so much communication among my social groups moving towards photo/video I feel kind of left out because my phone sucks at this.  Unfortunately, I can't just switch from my current phone to an iPhone, but really I already have a Touch so ideally there would be some way for me to just get it to act as much like an iPhone as possible.  How would I do this, and is there a way to do it without being reliant on WiFi?\n\nA: Your iPod is very similar to an iPhone. However, there is one major difference - it does not have the ability to send and receive cellular. Any kind of video chatting with an iPod requires WiFi. You may be able to communicate with Bluetooth also; however, what I have read it can only go between to Apple products and has very little range.\n", "Q: Where can I purchase Mavericks?

I have a few audiofiles on my PCs (Windows/Mac) that I would like to listen to on the go on my iPhone.  Is it possible to copy them somehow onto the mobile without using iTunes?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible however Apple seems to have gone to great lengths to try to prevent you from doing this. Especially if you meant without the use of any sort of app on the PC at all, as if it were simply a disk drive in explorer.\nThat, I believe, is not possilble/practical without first jailbreaking your phone. If you do not have iOS 8 and you have not jailbroken your phone, I would suggest that you do while you still are able to and while it is a simple \"one-button\" process. While Pangu recently released a jailbreak for iOS 8, it is reportedly still a bit buggy so I would wait a bit if you have iOS 8. You would jailbreak your iPhone by downloading the pangu app on your PC from http://en.pangu.io/\nHowever, if you don't want to jailbreak but you don't want to use iTunes, there are a number of different \"replacements\" for iTunes. Many people even go so far as to completely remove iTunes from their system as well.\nMedia Monkey is a rather full-featured replacement for iTunes that can do a number of things that iTunes can or will not. I personally liked MM when I was using it a year or two ago. They support Android as well.  You can download it at http://www.mediamonkey.com/download/\nAnother option is called iFunbox. They recently revamped their software but luckily they deigned to keep the older version, calling it iFunbox classic. Here's a quote from their website about it.\"\n\nWith iFunBox Classic included, you can still manage files on your iDevice with no jailbreak needed. Here's some basic features:\n• Safe ipa package installation and easy access to files and resources in app sandbox.

Put the audio files in the dropbox folder and then access them on your iPhone.\nDropbox will play audio files but it's a pretty simple player.\nRon is right though, Apple goes out of their way to lock your iPhone to iTunes. It's annoying but remember that Apple sells software only to make their hardware more valuable, which is why you get iTunes (and Mac O/S...) for free. So annoying as it is, I suppose it is understandable...\n", "Q: Re-directed screenshot location via defaults file doesn't work I'm sure everyone knows about the standard changing default location where captured screenshots are stored.\nA simple \nsudo defaults write com.apple.screencapture location <enter path to folder>\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nshould have sufficed but nothing happens.\nMy screenshots still save to desktop but the worst part is, when I read the file I've just written to, it tells me that the location that screenshots are being saved in is the folder that I've redirected to! \nsudo defaults read com.apple.screencapture\n\ngives\n{\nlocation = \"/Users/Me/Documents/Screenshots/\"'\n}\n\nHowever it continues to save them to my desktop.

Just run the commands without sudo and you should be fine.\nYou can also clear any settings for a user with:\ndefaults delete com.apple.screencapture\n\nYou can test and log out if the system doesn’t realize the change was made. That’s usually better than killing the system UI server.\n", "Q: How do I delete or fix my Keychain after changing my password? How do I reset my main keychain and completely delete the old one?\nI changed my password and its been coming up with all of these popups asking for my new password when I first login.\nIf anyone can help with updating my keychain I would appreciate it or you can just help me completely delete and reset it.\n\nA: Previous answers didn't work for me. Apple Tech Support solution that works in removing the keychains completely :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder page : Choose GO, Choose Library, Choose Preferences\n\n*Move all reference to keychain to Trash bin.\n\n*Reboot iMac and when prompted to change or reset Keychain\n\n*Choose Change Keychain\n\n*Reboot system & NO MORE PROMPT FOR Keychain password!!\n\n\nA: Try running Keychain's Repair Tool by opening Keychain from your /Applications/Utilities folder, then from the menu bar choose Keychain Access, then Keychain First Aid, then enter your password, verify then start it. If there are any problems click Repair then Start. (via Apple Support)\nIf that doesn't work then try Resetting your Keychain.\nVia Apple's Instructions you just need to do these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keychain Access, which is in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.\n\n*From the Keychain Access menu, choose Preferences.\n\n*Click General, then click Reset My Default Keychain.\n\n*Authenticate with your account login password.\n\n*Quit Keychain Access then Restart your computer.\n\n\nA: Along the same lines:\n\"You can safely delete the Keychains folder (or just the folders inside it) in your home directory\neg. /Users/yourusername/Library/Keychains\n\nthis folder can be deleted. It will be recreated on login.\"\nOr you can access the Library folder by going to Finder >> Go and holding down the option key.\n\nThis worked perfectly for me. \nSource:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2355503?tstart=0\nMake sure you restart the computer after deleting the folder before doing anything else Very Important!!\n\nA: Synchronise your user account and keychain passwords!\nThe password of your macOS user account might not match the password of your login keychain. To resolve this, you can either replace your keychain and create a new login keychain, or you can update the old keychain with your new password.\nThis can happen after you or your Mac administrator resets the password of your macOS user account. You Mac might then ask you to update your keychain password or enter the password of your login keychain. It might also tell you that the system was unable to unlock your login keychain. That's because your login keychain is still using your old password.\nIf you don't know your old password, the solution is to create a new login keychain.\nIf you do know your old password, use that password to update your existing login keychain:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Keychain Access app, which is in the the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n\n*From the Edit menu, choose “Change Password for Keychain 'login.'”\n\n*Enter the old password of your user account in the Current Password field. This is the password you were using before the password was reset.\n\n*Enter the new password of your user account in the New Password field. This is the password you're now using to log in to your Mac. Enter the same password in the Verify field.\n\n*Click OK when done, then quit Keychain Access.\n\nTaken from Mac support.\n\nA: In High Sierra, my login keychain was stuck on the previous password.  I tried to set it in Keychain Access but the item in the Edit menu was greyed out.\nI found a suggestion on https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/28449/change-password-for-keychain-login-greyed-out to use the security command-line utility in the Terminal to set the keychain password to my new login password.  Just security set-keychain-password with no further arguments failed after asking for the old and new password, but I then discovered with security default-keychain the full path name to my login keychain:\nbash$ security default-keychain\n    \"/Users/myself/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\"\n\nbash$ security set-keychain-password \"/Users/myself/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\"\nOld Password:\nNew Password:\nRetype New Password:\n\nbash$\n\nYou would obviously replace myself with your login name, or copy-paste the result from default-keychain if it looks radically different from mine. (You can save yourself the copy/paste with security default-keychain | xargs security set-keychain-password.)\n", "Q: Is there away to see the internal process of a software? I would like to be able to see/monitor how a software \"works\" once it's running. For example I would like to see what happens internally when you click on a button, or any other interaction within an app. I tried using Instruments (xcode), but Instruments only let me select an application that's already running. Which means I always miss the initial process of when the application starts running.\nI am not looking for resource usage, just trying to understand how the internal files work.\n\nA: Open Activity Monitor\nSelect the process you want to monitor\nClick the \"Gear\" icon and choose \"Sample Process\"\nNB: I am not claiming this will be of any use to you.

By \"in use\", I mean logged in and not in sleep mode.\nIf there is no such pre-existing log, is there software I can install or even a script I can modify to log this data for me?\n\nA: Do you mean that you want to know the length of time of the current login session, or the total use for the machine since it left the factory?\nThe latter is not possible because the logs that store that sort of information rotate. The former is sort of possible, but will take you checking the logs frequently. For one, the last command will show recent login sessions.\nI don't think any of those options will strip out sleep time, so that would take a lot more effort where you'd have to write a log parser that looked for sleep/wake events and took that time out of the appropriate login session.\nIt's not something there is a simple solution for.\nIf you want to keep track of logins and logout you would be better off writing a loginhook and logouthook to log to your own file.\n", "Q: Change resolution of different images from different folders Hej guys, \nmy case is like this : \ni have cover images under diffrent folders\n books -->book1_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\n books -->book2_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\n books -->book3_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\n books -->book4_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\n books -->book5_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\n ..\n\n ..\n\n .. \n\n books -->book85_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg\n\nNow i would like to duplicate those cover.jpg image , one is original cover.jpg and another one with lower resolution with a name cover_thumb.jpg.\nso finally i would like to have it like :\n books -->book1_folder--->images_folder-->cover.jpg, cover_thumb.jpg\n\nI found few solutions with mac preview tool, but its not duplicating all images at once.\nAny smart solution for this case, \n\nA: There is a function called Folder Action.\nRight click on the originating folder.\nSelect Folder action\nNow select the Action you want (in your case Duplicate)\nYou can modify the script if you want to to suit your needs, but it will basically make copies of files at the moment they are added to the original folder in a newly created folder.\n", "Q: Can I display GMT on my iPad's world clock?

If you set the clock for Reykjavík, Iceland, it matched GMT a year round. If any answer can make the clock labeled something more like Greenwich Mean Time or UTC or something like that, I'd prefer such an answer to my own.\n\nA: Select UTC instead of a city.

I'm running the most resent version of Yosemite and have noticed something called SIMBL Agent in the login items setting. I've tried to remove it but when I do it my computer locks up and I can't get rid of it. I've done some research into and I'm just wondering if someone knows how to get rid of it. I've read that it's something to do with Apple developers.\n\nA: The easiest way to uninstall SIMBL is to run the its bundled uninstaller.\nYou can get a copy from the official website.\nAfter the uninstallation check if these folders are present:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL\n\n*/Library/Application Support/SIMBL\nIf they are present you can easily delete them.\nSince OS X 10.11+ SIMBL gets broken due to the introduction of SIP by Apple (System Integrity Protection).\nThere is no need to disable SIP before the process and re-enable it later.\n\nA: SIMBL is an app to \"hack\" (inject) code in OS X (eg: add plugins to the Finder etc).\nIf your computer is yours (not controled by an adminsys or you company (if relevant)) it should be safe to remove it.\nAnd since latest version of OS X (10.11) is sort of broken due to the introduction of SIP by Apple (System Integrity Protection).\nTo uninstall SIMBL you can do the following\nUninstall SIMBL on OS X 10.11\nDisable SIP\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your computer\n\n*Restart by holding cmd+r\n\n*Start recovery partition\n\n*Start “Terminal” from the menubar\n\n*$ csrutil disable; reboot\n\n\nSource: http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/\nUninstall SIMBL\n$ locate SIMBL | sudo xargs rm -rf\nSource: https://superuser.com/a/421002/381999\nEnable SIP back\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your computer\n\n*Restart by holding cmd+r\n\n*Start recovery partition\n\n*Start “Terminal” from the menubar\n\n*$ csrutil enable; reboot\n\n\nEt voilà!

I have a 1TB SSD in a 15\" Mac Book Pro\nIt took about 30 hrs to Encrypt, which during, the computer was virtually unusable. It just finished with that and now it says it is optimizing with 5 DAYS!!!! remaining. I wish I never agreed to do it. Has anyone turned it off after the whole process is complete and if so how long did that take?\n\nA: Just go to System Preferences, click on Security, then FileVault then click the button that says turn off FileVault. But if you have it on, I would recommend leaving it on. It increases your security, and may take a while to turn off (decrypt) your files, but it's your choice.\n\nA: I have a mac mini late 2012 with 1TB hard drive. There were 875GB free when I decided to turn off filevault 2 on Yosemite. It started at 9am and was done before 8pm. I checked disk activity from the activity monitor and it said about 975GB read/write at the end and the speed varied from 40MB/s to 20 or even 10MB/s at the very end. So, it seems like regardless how much space you have used, the OS will have to go through the whole disk read and write. My reason to turn it off was that it is my work computer and I think my office mates should be able to turn it off, turn it on, and log in with their account.\nI'd like to add that the OS locked my keyboard when decrypting the harddrive. Plan the job accordingly. \n\nA: MacBook Air with 128GB internal flash drive. Took about and 90 minutes to turn FileVault on. Taking so far 3 hours and showing another 5 hours to go to turn off. I can't imagine why it would take that long. I wouldn't mind but I was hoping to turn it off just for a few hours while I was doing stuff that involved restarting quite a bit. Wanted to set user to automatic login. I don't think I'll bother turning it back on after this. I know how to encrypt my private and important stuff and I have 2 back ups. One local and one time capsule at a different location. I think I'm covered. \n\nA: I have a Macbook Pro 13\" Early 2015 3,1 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB, 500GB SSD, macOS Sierra 10.12.16\nI was experiencing severe speed degradation, CPU overloading, the spinning beach ball and forced reboots for several months.  It primarily occurred during videos playing in Chrome or Safari, and during video conference calling, but also with other applications.  I was avoiding having to do a complete reinstall of macOS.\nI went through the list of potential causes and fixes here:\nhttp://machmachines.com/mac-slow-high-sierra-update-fix/\nThe last thing I tried was turning off FileVault.  It took about 1hr.\nAfter turning off FileVault, the problem is fixed, and my Mac is back to normal speed!\n\nA: MacBook Pro (2.66Hz) 256GB SSD: estimated 2 hours, took 1:45.\nThat’s not counting time to make the estimate. That was around 2 hours by itself. The “estimated estimate” displayed while estimating the actual work time bounced all around. At one point it was estimating 1355 DAYS, but it stabilized on 2hr, which ended up pretty accurate.\n\nA: NEVER EVER TURN ON FILEVAULT....WORST THING YOU WILL EVER DO.\nif something goes wrong in the startup process you mac will not turn on and you will need to call support.

No internet, contact and so on can't be use at all.  My iPad is literally jammed.  Shutting down and erasing things is useless because I can't use a password that recognizes the old email.\nCan any one help me?\n\nA: You need to reinstate your original email password (the one associated with App Store, iMessage, iCloud etc.)\nYou cannot change primary email addresses without complications to the best of my knowledge. I'm stuck using an old hotmail address as my login ID because it was not possible to change the login info.\nIf you have no access to the previous email at all then you can't confirm the change in primary email address, either, so will need to call Apple (at least that was the case for Australia, USA may differ)\n", "Q: SMB: auto-unmount then unable to re-mount without restart I have a recurring problem with mounting/un-mounting remote directories via SMB, however I don't know what triggers the problem nor how to resolve it.\nBackground:\nAfter successfully mounting the directory via SMB and some time using it, the directory seems to unmount by itself. When this happens, I am unable to re-mount the directory until I restart my system.\nIf I don't restart the system and use the \"Connect to Server\" dialog to try to mount the directory via SMB, the dialog disappears as though the connection was successful, however nothing is mounted.\nIf I try to do the same thing with a parent directory (which is the root directory of the server), then the connection appears to be successful and prompts me to \"Select the volumes you want to mount on 'xyz.server.name':\" with a listing of directories. The directory that I previously mounted (which auto-unmounted) is listed, but is ghosted out and therefore unable to be selected.\nWhen SSH-ing into the server, there does not appear to be any problem with accessing the directory.\nThis problem occurs for other remote directories as well (though I have not been able to test it on another server).\nAlso, when trying to reconnect under this scenario, Console reports the following issue:\n\"30/10/2014 11:48:20.520 am NetAuthSysAgent[3346]: smb_mount: mount failed to my.server.com/mydirectory, syserr = File exists\"\nQuestions:\ni) What is causing the directory/volume to be unmounted?\nii) How can I prevent the auto-unmount from happening?\niii) If an auto-unmount occurs, how can I re-mount the directory without restarting?\nSystem details:\nOS X 10.9.5\nRetina, 15-inch, Early 2013\nServer details:\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.11 (Tikanga)\nKernel version 2.6.18-371.8.1.el5\nOutput of df:\nBefore problem:\nFilesystem                                        512-blocks        Used  Available Capacity   iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                                       975425848   899360656   75553192    93% 112484080    9444149   92%   /\ndevfs                                                    371         371          0   100%       644          0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts                                                 0           0          0   100%         0          0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home                                              0           0          0   100%         0          0  100%   /home\n//josh@example.com/josh                          10568950416 10486471008   82479408   100%         0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/josh\n//josh@example.com/semantic                      12682735248  7708953400 4973781848    61%         0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/semantic\n\nAfter problem:\nFilesystem                                        512-blocks        Used  Available Capacity   iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                                       975425848   899350976   75562872    93% 112482870    9445359   92%   /\ndevfs                                                    373         373          0   100%       648          0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts                                                 0           0          0   100%         0          0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home                                              0           0          0   100%         0          0  100%   /home\n//josh@example.com/josh                          10568950416 10466951592  101998824   100%         0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/josh\n//josh@example.com/semantic                      12682735248  7708953400 4973781848    61%         0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/semantic\n\nObservations:\nThe mounted directories are still listed in /Volumes when viewed from the terminal, (i.e.  'ls /Volumes'), though this is not always the case, but both directories are inaccessible. They are not visible within Finder at all.\nHowever, I am able to still access the content of one of the directories from Matlab, which was already within a subdirectory of this directory (its working directory). If I then move outside of the directory in Matlab (say, to my home directory), I am unable to return to it via the 'cd' command but instead need to press the back button within the file navigation toolbar and then everything is accessible again from within Matlab.\n\nA: I'm going to put up an answer to question 3. Not sure the rest can be easily diagnosed.\n\"If an auto-unmount occurs, how can I re-mount the directory without restarting?\"\nTry diskutil umount /Volumes/josh and it should do the trick.\nThe \"File exists\" error is showing up because the mount point it wants to use is already present. Looks like the disk isn't actually unmounted, just that Finder can't see it. This is why Matlab can still access the files on it.\n\nA: According to the Red Hat site, they don't support using SMB shares using the OS X Finder. Looks like you can still get at it using the Terminal, so that could be a workaround for now.\nIn regards to the random disconnect: It sounds like the share will connect initially, and then freak out after it realizes it's in the Mac environment. Looks to me like the share doesn't unmount correctly, and that's why you wouldn't be able to re-connect to it. It's actually still there, just not visible in Finder.\nIf you were to manually unmount the share using the Terminal, I'd expect it wouldn't be greyed out if you were to try and connect to it again.\nA fix: Depending on how the Red Hat server was set up, you should be able to FTP into it. Mac has a few FTP GUIs that you can try out, or use the Terminal's ftp command.\n\nA: \nWhat is causing the directory/volume to be unmounted?\n\nMost probably a network connection instability which might be amplified by the use of the Automatic configuration which might switch from Ethernet to Airport trying to maintain your network connectivity.\nTo validate this hypothesis, use:\nnetstat -I\nping -c 90 -i 10 your_SMB_server\ntail -f /var/log/system.log\n...\n\n\nHow can I prevent the auto-unmount from happening?\n\nIf this netwok problem is confirmed, then fix it :):\n\n\n*\n\n*change cable\n\n*change switch port\n\n*ask your network admin\n\n*...\n\n\n\nIf an auto-unmount occurs, how can I re-mount the directory without\n  restarting?\n\nYou can't if the unmount didn't terminate correctly. Some state information within your SMB kernel extension is corrupted (half modified) and can't be fixed in any other way than the correct termination of the pending unmount. If your connection was broken,\nI know of one uniq way to terminate a pending SMB unmount: shutdown\nof Mac OS X (I tried a kextunload which lead to a total failure).\nYou should absolutely avoid such a pending unmount to occur.\n\nA: The answer from miken32 didn't work for me, but got me on the right track. My problem was solved after unmounting all shares on the server in question (in your case \"example.com\").\nSo, using your case, diskutil umount /Volumes/josh isn't enough, because /Volumes/semantic still remains. You must unmount that one, too. After that, remounting should work (it did at least for me).\nBi the way, you don't have to use diskutil, instead you can execute\numount //josh@example.com/josh\n\nand\numount //josh@example.com/semantic\n\n\nA: I have same problem, had it on 10.6.8 and now on 10.11. The cause is twofold: for one, share is supposed to unmount (e.g. on sleep), but it cannot because it is being (flagged as) used, so it dies and what is left is a folder in /Volumes which you could sometimes just delete and then remount. However in 10.11 it is invisible in Finder AFTER the share dies (see Finder preferences, they say Finder shows only active shares. \nFor the second, the flag that the files are in use is set by MatLab. Some times you can remove them by MatLab command fclose all and cd to some other place to free the share, some times you actually do use files (by editing .m script from the share). But often after a period of inactivity it goes in a dead lock: umount and diskutil unmount cannot release the share because \"Resource busy\" and MatLab cannot release its flags because the share is long gone.\nI use macfusion, so there indeed is a mechanism for the share to die when sshfs looses connection to the server. Out of these three: Finder, MatLab and fuse, I would say the MatLab is evil, as other programs like BBedit never lock the share in such a deadly way. I often can remount only after I quit MatLab.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite My Calendar Icon Stopped Updating Since upgrading to Yosemite, the calendar icon in my dock has been stuck on October 17. I have had no luck getting it to display the correct date.\nHas anyone else run into/found a solution for this issue? Its driving me insane.\n\nA: This is a little old, but for those still looking for a quick fix:\nOpen up the terminal and enter the following command:\n'killall Dock' \nThis should reload your dock, including all of the icons thus updating the date displayed in the calendar icon.\n\nA: I restarted the computer and unchecked the \"reopen all windows\" checkbox, and the issue was resolved when I logged in.\n\nA: Seems calendar needs to be open to update icon on dock.\n", "Q: Trust this computer - what is shared? Apologies if this has been asked before, but when you trust a computer, what data is shared?\nI'm on iOS 8 and have been plugging my personal phone into my work PC for charging. I click \"trust\" because I thought if I clicked \"don't trust\" it wouldn't charge.\nIt says data, contacts, and other things of that nature are shared when clicking \"Trust.\" Apple seems pretty vague with \"other things.\" My question is, is it possible that my text messages are synced to my work computer when I hit \"trust\"? If so, can my employer read them? I tried looking online but couldn't find anything about text data being stored on a PC computer after clicking \"Trust.\"\nI only ask because I've been considering leaving my company and texted a friend about it. Thanks!\n\nA: Unless you explicitly backed up your iPhone to your work PC using iTunes (or ran some other type of program like Macroplant's iExplorer), you're probably fine. Tapping the \"Trust\" button does allow a computer to access an iPhone's information, but doesn't initiate any particular kind of access.\nFor more information, see 'Trust This Computer' alert on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\nLet me know if this helps.\n\nA: No your test messages can't be synced on your computer, though your contacts and data can, go in iTunes and you can manually manage the data which you want or do not want to be synced by iTunes, \nfor eg: when you connect your device to iTunes, Select your device and click on the respective tabs which appear on the iTunes menu , if you choose Music, then it will show you the below Screen \n\nyou can uncheck the sync option if you don't want to be syncing your data to your PC\n", "Q: How do I install OS X Yosemite on an unsupported MacBook?

I used an iPhone 3G from May of 2009 until around the spring of 2013, at which time I upgraded to the iPhone 5. I've always been a prolific iPhotographer :) and recently pulled around 12,000 photos off my iPhone 5 for backup and to free up disk space. I've kept the old iPhone 3G, though, and suspect it has thousands of pictures on it that need to be removed from the phone and backed up on my cloud, my laptop, and an external hard drive. However, Apple no longer makes available the OSX that supports and grants access to an iPhone 3G through iTunes. I can't hook it up to my laptop (Dell XPS 15Z, if it helps to know what I'm running, with Windows 7) and access the pictures to manually move them off the phone.\nHow do I recover pictures from an iPhone 3G? Is there anything that can be done?\nIs there anything that can be done? As it is, I can't get my computer to even see the 3G, much less charge the phone through the computer or allow me to access the phone's drives and my pics. I'm currently charging the 3G via wall plug/USB, which I think will allow me to look at my photos on the phone itself once the phone is juiced up ... but I really just want to recover and transfer my images off the iPhone 3G for safekeeping.\nI did search this site prior to posting and could not find my exact question. Please don't hesitate to VTC if I've accidentally submitted a duplicate.\n\nA: Mac - iPhoto\nWindows - Photo Gallery, part of Microsoft Essentials.\nBoth will offer to import photos from any connected iPhone\nBTW, by default an iPhone will not appear as a device on the desktop, only in an app ready to 'talk' to it, iTunes, iPhoto etc.\n\nA: You should be able to plug any iPhone into a PC and (if the phone is generally working) it will show up as a storage device under My Computer.\nOn a Mac it may be a bit more problematic as you have to go through iTunes.\nPerhaps you could tell us what errors show up on the Mac or PC when you plug your iPhone into your Mac or PC?\nBTW I have never heard anyone refer to iPhone models as iPhone 1.0 or 5.0. For clarity and to avoid confusion if you refer to them as the model name that lowers the confusion level. Go into the iPhone, system settings -> General -> About, it will show the model number. Mine is MD640LL/A, Google that number and you will find the model you have...\n\nA: I have solved my problem!\nFirst, I managed to get the phone to boot up by charging it straight from the wall to the device. Because Apple no longer supports the 3G, I've been unable to charge the phone through my computer (a Dell XPS 15Z laptop) for quite a long time. But when I did a basic connection to an outlet, it started charging immediately. \nI have a PC, so I don't have to go through iTunes in order to access the pics on either of my iPhones; the Dell treats them essentially as an external hard drive. So I went in through the operating system: Computer --> OS (C:) --> iPhone --> Internal Storage -- > DCIM --> Folder(s) (named by the phone as a string of 7 or 8 numbers). I then opened the folder, selected my pics and movies, and drag-'n-dropped them into a new folder I created on my hard drive. I backed up the pics to my external hard drive and Google Drive and I'm all good to go!\nI appreciate the assistance and helpful comments I received -- I'll definitely rec the Apple stack to friends and colleagues who use Apple products. \n", "Q: How to rename formula installed via Homebrew?

My Macbook Pro is my primary workstation, and when I switch to the iMac I would like my environment to be exactly the same in order to facilitate switching between the two during the day.\nI read somewhere that it's possible to make a Macbook Pro behave as a simple external disk and connect it to another device that can read it. This means it might be possible to connect the Macbook Pro to the iMac and let the iMac boot from the Macbook Pro's disk, effectively providing the same environment on both machines.\nIs this sort of thing possible? Will the two devices operate well while trying to boot from the same startup disk?\n\nA: Depending on your Macs you might use the FireWire/Thunderbolt target-disk mode.  \nApple-KB: \n\nIf you have two Mac computers with FireWire or Thunderbolt ports, you can connect them so that one of them appears as an external hard disk on the other. This is called “target disk mode.”\n  1. Connect the two computers with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable.\n  2. Start up the computer to be used as a disk in target disk mode:\n  - If the computer is off, start it up while holding down the T key.\n  - If the computer is on, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Startup Disk, and then click Target Disk Mode.\n  When the computer has started up, a disk icon appears on the desktop of the other computer.\n  3. Transfer files by dragging them to and from the disk.\n  4. Eject the disk by dragging its icon to the Trash.\n  While you drag, the Trash icon changes to an Eject icon.\n  5. On the computer you used as a disk, push the power button to shut it down, and then disconnect the cable.\n\nThe target-mode-Mac will act as an additional external harddrive. You may use that as a start volume though and consequently have the MacBook Pro environment with a bigger monitor and better sound assumed the target-mode-Mac is your MacBook Pro.\nBut the environments on the two internal drives still differ. Example: If you add a user in the above case you will add it to the MacBook Pro System and not to the iMac System.\nThe only way to have identical environments is to clone one to another.\n", "Q: Deleting the original files iTunes I let iTunes copy the files i add to it into the iTunes Media folder. I have recently learned that I can delete songs from my mac once they are in iTunes. Having not known this, the amount of storage being taken up by audio on my laptop is huge. I was wondering, if there is a way through iTunes, or perhaps a AppleScript, that will locate all the original files of my iTunes and delete them as they are not needed as they are stored in the iTunes media folder. This would mean i have over 100GB of space saved on my laptop (Yes I have a lot of music).\nAnyone able to help would be wicked,\nDan\n\nA: iTunes does not keep track of where imported files were originally found. In other words, it knows where the copied files are (within the iTunes folders) but it has no record of where the original files are scattered around your hard drive.\nThat said, you could use Spotlight to find the files. Note that for this method you will need to know where your iTunes folder is. (Unless you have moved it, it is located at /Users/your-username/Music/iTunes.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder.\n\n*Click on your computer's name in the sidebar under Devices.\n\n*In the search box at the upper-left, type kind:music. (A drop-down menu will appear asking if you meant \"name: music\". Click outside of the menu to make it disappear.)\n\n*To the far left, right under the search box, you will see two buttons, \"Save\" and a plus sign. Click the plus sign.\n\n*On the new row that appears, it should say \"Kind is Any\". Across from this there is a minus button and a plus button. Press and hold Option and click the \"...\" button (which replaced the plus sign button because you are pressing Option).\n\n*Now click the minus button on the \"Kind is Any\" row.\n\n*You should now see a row that says \"Any of the following are true\". Change \"Any\" to \"None\".\n\n*On the line below that, click the first drop-down menu and choose \"Other...\" at the bottom.\n\n*In the window that pops up, type \"folder\". You should see two results, one of which is \"Document Container\". Click on that line and click OK.\n\n*Next to where it now says Document Container, change \"matches\" to \"contains\".\n\n*In the box, type iTunes.\n\n\nThis will search for all files on your machine that are music, and that do not live in the iTunes folder. All of the resulting files should safely be able to be removed.\n\nA: It isn't exactly that you can delete the tracks once they are in iTunes: it's that iTunes' default configuration leaves your original file where it was and makes a new copy in the iTunes music folder. So the first thing to do is determine whether or not this is how your iTunes is configured - whether or not you really have duplicates of the files. In iTunes, open the Preferences (\"iTunes\" menu --> Preferences), go to the Advanced tab, and see if \"Copy files…\" is checked.\nIf it is, and you've been adding files by dragging them into iTunes, you're right: you have lots of duplicates sitting around. In that case, you want to search you computer for all duplicate music files. There are lots of apps that do this… search Google \"mac duplicate remover\" or search the App Store for \"duplicate\". I personally like DupeGuru ME — it's very powerful, and gives you the option of reviewing all supposed duplicates before culling.\nGoing forward, iTunes actually has a solution to this problem… it's just poorly implemented. In the iTunes Media folder (might be called iTunes Music folder, if you're on an older version of iTunes - the default location is Music/iTunes/iTunes Media) there's an \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" folder. Anything dropped into that folder will be added to iTunes without duplication. I keep that folder in my Finder window sidebar so that it's always convenient\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite suspends inactive windows I have some user script that runs every about 10 minutes on specific page at opened tab in Safari 8.\nThe surprise is that safari somehow suspend javascript execution when tab is not active by user for a while.\nThe question is how to force javascript execution and prevent this behavior?\nUPD: actually the same behavior is detected in Opera.

I have a huge Lacie Thunderbolt only drive and I want to connect it to pre-thunderbolt computers but no matter where I look there doesn't seem to be a device or adapter which can achieve such.  \nI've looked at Lacie, Apple, and all over the internet but nada, nothing, zilch..  Rather than toss the drive in the attic I'd like to give it some new use but the machines it will connect to don't have a thunderbolt.  Newer drives at least give you the option of using both but I was wondering if anyone out there might have some suggestions.\n\nA: Thunderbolt is PCI express, so you would need an older machine to have a PCI express bus or card and then add an adapter card which would cost far more than a new USB drive.\nI don't think that adapter (which is eminently makable) would be brought to market due to the cost of the \"solution\" to be implemented.\nIf you need a drive that connects to old and new computers, perhaps trading your awesome Thunderbolt drive for a USB one would make sense, but you might instead put the files on an internet share to do short term sharing of the data.\n", "Q: How do you turn on \"show pre-release updates\" in yosemite? I accidentally turn off \"Show Pre-Release Updates\" settings in the system preferences. Change option does not appear in the relevant section.\nWhat is your suggestion?\n\n\nA: @Marksorry I can't comment your question directly, since I'd need 50 reputation to do so.For your question: Wen you quit your subscription for the seeds you basically uninstall a program on your Mac. You can re-download that program directly from Apple and install it. Since the Beta-Progamm is linked to your Apple-ID you have to log in with it. Once you downloaded that file (YosemiteBetaAccessUtility.dmg) you simply install it and you have access for the Pre-Release Updates again. Just open Appstore and install the updates.I found the file with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to appleseed.apple.com\n\n*Click \"first steps with OS X Yosemite Beta\"\n\n*Scroll down the site till you find the button where you can download the Beta Access Utility.\n\n*Download and install\n\n*Restart if needed and it's finished\n\n\nA: The option you are referring to was listed as \"Your computer is set to receive pre-release Software Update seeds\" with a button labeled Change next to it. By clicking Change, you could opt into or out of the OS X Public Beta Program.\nHowever, Yosemite is no longer in beta, and therefore the option was removed from the final release.\nEdit: This information is out of date as it seems the OS X Yosemite Public Beta has been reopened.\n\nA: The download file can be found here.\nYou'll have to log in via your Apple-ID.\n", "Q: What have I done to Preview in Yosemite? I used to open the annotations toolbar and I could select, for example, the arrow tool. Then I would click from A to B and draw the arrow.\nNow when I click the arrow tool it plops an arrow on the screenshot and I have to manually drag both ends.\nThis seems like extra work compared to the old way, what am I likely to have done to have caused this and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: I just tested this. Clicking the Arrow tool does indeed simply add an arrow instead of having you drag it out first.\nI rarely if ever use the Annotate toolbar, so I am certain I have not made any changes that would have caused this. More likely, the upgrade to Yosemite changed how this tool works.\n", "Q: Yosemite maximization shortcut and Java applications I'm using OSX Yosemite and I hate how windows maximization works... previously (with Mountain Lion) I was using RightZoom, in order to always maximize windows as it should be (using the whole space). I discovered that by clicking on the green button with ALT + SHIFT the maximization is applied as I like, BUT is very annoying... so I created a shortcut (CMD+SHIFT+M) by going to preferences > shortcuts > app shortcuts > clicking on \"+\" and creating a shortcut named \"Zoom\"... it works great for all the applications but not for the Java ones (or at least it does not work for Intellij Idea and PyCharm)... so... are app shortcuts available only for native Cocoa applications? Is there another way for a fast and simple maximization? (I was thinking about some kind of \"defaults write blahblah\", but I didn't find anything)\n\nA: http://spectacleapp.com is a free app which will allow you to do all sorts of window manipulation on the Mac, including “Fullscreen” which really means “maximize”:\n\nYou can set your own keyboard shortcuts, of course.\n\nA: It's not strictly speaking about Cocoa apps vs Java apps.\nWhat you're doing when you create a shortcut like that is assigning a keyboard shortcut to existing menu items. So if the application has a \"Zoom\" menu item, your keyboard shortcut will activate it.\nIf you have a window open that doesn't have a Zoom menu item, or where the Zoom menu item is disabled, your shortcut won't work.\nYour shortcut will work in Eclipse for example, even though it's a Java application, because it provides the Zoom action.\nSo there won't be a system-wide way to assign a shortcut to this action without using third-party software - either the application provides the Zoom action or it doesn't. It might be worth filing feature requests with the application developers, as it's standard in OS X applications to provide this menu item.\n", "Q: Can I update to iOS 7.1.2, instead of iOS 8.1, on iPhone 5S? Can anyone help me? My iPhone 5S is on iOS 7.1.1. Can i still update to 7.1.2 without Apple forcing me to update to iOS 8.1?\n\nA: You can't. Apple has stopped signing iOS 7.1.2 but they are currently signing iOS 8.1. Your two choices are to stay put on 7.1.1 or upgrade to 8.1 \n", "Q: OSX - Only show apps with open windows in the dock? I like to keep my dock tidy with almost only the applications I'm currently using shown. As such, I tend to completely quit out of apps so that they don't clutter my dock. However, there are apps which would be advantageous to allow to update in the background (e.g. mail). Is there a way to allow an app to remain open, but hide the icon when there are no open windows? I've seen ways to completely hide the icon at all times, but I would prefer that the icon was there when there are active windows open. Any clean way of doing this? Thank you much.\n\nA: Hide the Dock, then use Contexts for Mac to switch between active windows. Contexts has an option to show only the application with active windows regardless it’s running in background or not. You can read my review here.\n\nA: So I found this to be closest to what you want.\nShow One Application At A Time\nyou can enable a ‘single application’ mode by entering the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock single-app -bool true\n\nYou must then enter this command in order to see the changes:\nkillall Dock\n\nThis mode allows for only 1 application to be shown at one time.\n", "Q: Can I separate Facetime audio from system audio? I have an iPhone 6 and MBP on OSX Yosemite.  The new feature in OSX allowing me to take a call through my MBP is fantastic, but it's less practical than it could be because of how long it takes to switch the audio input/output settings to my headset.  The sequence goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*My normal audio settings have output through Cinema display, input through display (or built-in, whatever)\n\n*I'm listening to pandora\n\n*Call comes in.  Sweet!  I can use my headset!\n\n*Hold down ⌥ and click the speaker icon in the menu bar\n\n*Select output to go through my headset.\n\n*Repeat #4\n\n*Select input to come through my headset\n\n*Stop pandora so it doesn't interfere with the phone call\n\n*Answer call just in time to hear someone say \"call me back\" or just hang up\n\n*Make phone call on my phone, defeating the entire purpose\n\n\nSteps 4-9 take way too long.  The Google Hangouts plugin does this right, as does Skype (IIRC).  Those steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal audio settings\n\n*Listening to pandora\n\n*Call comes in, I grab headset\n\n*I answer call, pandora is squelched somewhat, the headset is piped through to the call automatically\n\n\nThe second set is what's desirable.  Is there a way to make Facetime on OSX do this?\n\nA: Have you considered trying Sound Siphon or Audio Hijack Pro to control your audio?\n", "Q: Safari 8.0 Full Screen Shortcut Not Working After updating to OS X Yosemite (Public Release), Safari and several other applications stopped recognising ⌃+⌘+F as the shortcut to enter Full Screen.

In theory they will delete the lock file once they are done using the resource. However if they crash they can end up leaving the lock file behind.\nThis is what is happening here. XQuartz is launching and wants to update the font cache but it sees the font_cache.lock file so thinks the font cache is already being updated. Most likely it isn't and it just crashed the last time it ran, leaving the lock file behind.\nJust delete the /opt/X11/var/run/font_cache.lock file and try XQuartz again.\n", "Q: Setting up a git (ssh) server using OS X Server I would like to use OS X Server to set up a git server that I can ssh into from other machines on my network.\nI realize that Xcode Service has repository functionality built in, but I am looking for a more universally accessible system (from Windows or other machine without Xcode), and my Xcode Service setup broke with Yosemite anyway. I also realize that git is already installed on my machine and that I can set up an ssh server by a method like this or this, but I don't want to make a new user or deal with things on the local machine level like the first post says (I have a full server already and I want to use its resources), and I don't want to install gitolite/gitlab/etc.\nTo sum up, I am looking for a way to host ssh-accessible git repositories on my machine using only git and OS X Server. Thank you for your time.\n\nA: You need to create a \"bare\" git repo: a repository that can never have files checked out. Everyone pulls and pushes from the server like normal, but nobody can actually work on the server (unless they make a non-bare clone).\nIf you are creating a new repository called \"my_bare_repo.git\", you can make it bare like so:\ncd /Users/git (or whatever)\ngit init --bare my_bare_repo.git\n\nUsing your git server\nOn the client machine, you would clone the repo like so:\ngit clone ssh://user@yourmachine.domain.com/Users/git/my_bare_repo.git\n\nIf you have an existing local repo, you can add a remote origin like so:\ngit remote add origin ssh://user@yourmachine.domain.com/Users/git/my_bare_repo.git\n\nThen use the server app to set up \"sharing only\" users that can use ssh services. You can manage the users and profiles locally or remotely through web and/or server app. The ssh access is controlled in the Server entry in the top left - then click on Settings on the right and select SSH.\n", "Q: cant get my number to change from email to my phone number I am need ing to know how I can use my cell phone number to send and recieve messages instead of my email address. \nWhen I go to my settings to change it my number is in grey and my email address is in black and I am needing to know how I can fix that? \n\nA: Even though the line is greyed out, the checkbox next to your phone number in Settings > Messages indicates it is being used for sending and receiving messages. The email address(es) listed indicate that iMessage also looks for iMessages sent to those address(es), and will deliver them as if they were sent to your phone number (so long as each one has a checkmark next to it as well).\n\nA: Your iPhone uses the Messages app to send messages to other devices. However, it works a bit differently depending on what device the person you are messaging is using.\nWhen you send a Message, the iPhone looks on Apple servers to see if the recipient owns an Apple Device. Remember when you had to register your device with an Apple ID? This was putting your 'email' in the Apple server. It also put your telephone number in the Apple server.  \nIf the server finds your recipient in the Apple servers, it automatcially sends a message via the Apple network, therefore not using the SMS network, which might incur charges (depending on your SMS or text message limits).\nIf the Apple server does not find your recipient, then it sends the message via SMS or text messaging, over the carriers system. So, if you send a message to a friend who has an Android phone, the Apple server won't find that device in its database, and will then send the message via regular text messaging service, so the Android phone can receive it.\nThis systems allows you to message anyone, and Apple simply figures out the best way to send the message, whether its via Apple's system, which does not incur SMS fees, or via the carrier's system, which might incur fees. (most users in the USA have unlimited text messaging plans these days, so this is less than a concern. If you have a limit of 100 messages, you can appreciate how this is a good thing.)\nOK, now to your question: your email: Messages is NOT sending a message via email. It is simply using the email (which is likely your Apple ID), as an identifier of your device. This lets other Apple users send you a message to either your phone number or email address. This is useful on iPads, iPod Touch, and Macs, who can not send to phone numbers, because they do not have phone service. So, with Messages on your iPhone, someone on their Mac can send you a message, and you can message back!\n\nA: Go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive. Select the info icon by your email and choose Remove This Email. Then turn on sms, turn off iMessage and after a minute turn imessage on again and the email should be gone.\n", "Q: Can you use iMac Retina 5K as external monitor for a MacBook Pro? I remember when thunderbolt came out there was a lot of discussion of how it had interesting magical bi-directional capabilities. \nDoes that mean there is a way to use an iMac Retina 5K as an external, secondary monitor for a recent MacBook Pro?\n\nA: I have the iMac Retina 5k and can confirm that it doesn't support Target Display Mode. However, there's no problem with using thunderbolt bridge and screen sharing, i.e. \"same same but different\" ;)\n\nA: According to Apple, no. The iMac Retina 5K does not support Target Display Mode.\n\nNote that the iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) does not support Target Display Mode. \n\nYou can see it here.\n", "Q: Need to install minimum 10.9.4 for XCode, but running 2009 iMac with 2GB Ram, only option now is Yosemite been given a iMac to configure for my new job.\nIts a 2009 20\" iMac.

It wasn't the most pleasant thing, but it actually didn't work out too bad for him and he even thinks there was a slight performance increase (I'm assuming due to the memory compression stuff being a touch faster than swap). I'm assuming that Yosemite isn't going to be much more stressful than Mavericks, so you can probably get away with it.\nThat being said, 2GB is absolutely too little for a machine that you're going to run Xcode on. Regardless of Mountain Lion, Mavericks or Yosemite, you need more RAM. Period.\n\nA: A 2009 machine is certainly able to run the latest software - it looks like yours is an iMac9,1 : http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-2-duo-2.66-20-inch-aluminum-early-2009-specs.html\nMemory for that machine maxes out at 8GB, which runs about $100.

As far as I have been able to glean the upgrade went without a hitch, but now her computer is mostly unusable.  It is very slow, to navigate about the finder, slow to open programs, and largely unhappy.  She has over 100GB of free disk space and has 4 GB of RAM.  Any ideas about what went sideways?\nThe safari crashdump is too long to post here, so I have posted it on Dropbox:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9371124/safari_crash_dump.txt\n\nA: The solution we came up with... the only one that worked, was to reinstall Yosemite.  It seemed at the time that something went sideways with the original upgrade.  Unfortunately I do not have all the details with me here.\n\nA: This simple trick worked for me!\nCreat a guest account and login to that account. At first Safari should work in the new account (Since no cache, bookmarks, history, last session, etc). Then Go to Library/Safari and copy the contents to a shared folder (or pen drive). Now logout and login to your original account and go to Library/Safari and move the contents to thrash or create backup and copy the contents from pen drive to here. Try now and it should work. Later you may replace the bookmarks.plist to recover.\nNote: I tried almost all of the suggestions from google search except re-install. That included removing the cache, safe boot, clearing history, extensions,...\n\nA: Every piece of advice I used on the internet did not work. Even Apple's advice on removing things did not work. This worked.\ncd ~/Library/Safari/Extensions\nrm [plugins you KNOW did not come from apple]\n\nThe next part is key, in fact, this may be the only necessary step:\nnano Extensions.plist\n\nRemove everything between <dict> and </dict>.\n\nA: From your Safari crashdump, I found this for you that might help.\n\nClear the local DNS cache in OSX 10.10 Yosemite\n\nTerminal -> Using this code: dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\nLet me know if it helped since I do not have your problem to verify.\n\nA: i just solved the problem. you just have to erase all history from safari, under history options tab, at the bottom is the option to erase all. hope this solves your problem too.\n\nA: My Mac Mini/Safari seems to \"hang slightly\" once & awhile since the Yosemite install. If I turn-off wi-fi and back on, it \"unhangs.\" \nTry:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Safari\n\n*Trash the two Safari Preferences called com.apple.Safari and com.apple.Safari.rss.plist\n\n*Relaunch Safari. \n\n\nWorth a try. There is something buggy though in Yosemite/Safari.\n\nA: Had similar problem. Try removing ~/Library/Safari directory...it should fix the freezes...it worked for me\n\nA: I had one user whose Safari would not launch after updating to Yosemite. I ruled out problems with User cache and plist, isolated plug-ins, all the stuff mentioned above. I ended up finding a know working version of the app, from another machine, and copied over the broken app. Problem solved.\n\nA: Check Get Info on /Applications/Safari.app. When I had problems with Safari like this, the permissions it showed 2 entries for everyone. One was set to read-only, the other to read-write. I had not seen 2 settings for everyone before, so I set the second one to read-only. Bingo – instantly everything was full speed again. I rebooted to be sure, and all is wonderful again. Good luck.\n", "Q: Why does OS X use swap memory when memory pressure remains low? My system (Yosemite / 10.10) has been paging out to swap memory despite my memory pressure reading less than 50% over the last 7 days (tracked with iStat Menus). How is this possible? It would be one thing if memory pressure exceeded 100% at some point in the last week and then the swap file was activated, but that doesn't seem to have happened at all and yet I've got 1.25 GB of 2.00 GB being swapped right now, with 36% memory pressure. Shouldn't the new memory model introduced in Mavericks behave differently?\n\nA: This is one of the all-too-few times where the answer is officially documented by Apple.\nThe short answer is that the system tries to keep a certain amount of memory free so it can quickly provide memory to an application when the application requests it. When there is not enough free memory, then memory that has not been \"touched\" in a while gets swapped out. Often this is memory that the application \"leaked\", which is to say allocated, used for a while (maybe just once), and will never use again, but forgot to tell the OS it was done with.\nIn Yosemite and other versions of OS X, SystemUIServer was notorious for leaking lots of memory. This would be a prime candidate for getting swapped out, because it was not needed by the app, but could not be reclaimed by the OS. Swapping this memory out to disk is all upside for performance; the only downside is a relatively tiny amount of disk space used.\n", "Q: Will 2GB ram run Yosemite smoothly cant upgrade my 2009 iMac 2009 20\" with 2GB for a few months but need to upgrade to 10.9.4 to install Yosemite.\nI am currently running 10.8.1 as a fresh install of Mountain Lion which runs fine, but I dont want to install Yosemite and have OS hang and beach ball on me.\nNot running anything to intensive, at most; Sublime, Spotify, terminal, Firefox\n\nA: A friend of mine recently upgraded his MacBook5,1 (2009 core 2 duo) with 2GB to Mavericks. It wasn't the most pleasant thing, but it actually didn't work out too bad for him and he even thinks there was a slight performance increase (I'm assuming due to the memory compression stuff being a touch faster than swap). I'm assuming that Yosemite isn't going to be much more stressful than Mavericks, so you can probably get away with it.\nThat being said, 2GB is absolutely too little these days if you're going to run more than one application. You are going to get beach balls, but perhaps slightly less than what you did with Mountain Lion. Again, I'm assuming this because of the memory compression introduced in Mavericks works faster than swapping to disk and with that little RAM you will be swapping out (or compressing) pages.\n\nA: I had Yosemite running on my MacBook (13\" mid-2010) with 2 Gb, but it is unworkably slow.  Minimal apps including email and safari along with the OS will eat 2.7 Gb.  Everything is frustratingly slow, much more so than under Mavericks, which was ok but not great.  Just now I increased the ram to 4 Gb (the most for this machine) and everything is smooth and fast.  Do not do Yosemite with 2 Gb.  Get more memory first.\n\nA: I have a 2008 MacBook and I am running Yosemite and it can be very slow at times although I am putting in much more intensive use into it. I am doing computer programming and constantly running more than 5 apps at once. For basic web browsing, listening to music, and using command line you should be just fine. I'm warning you that every once in a while there will be times where you computer might slow down. If you are logging in and out of users and rebooting it will be slower than normal. Otherwise you should be fine upgrading\nedit\nI also have 2 GB of RAM\n\nA: Our school had to upgrade a slew of older, Mavericks-compatible Macs to 4GB RAM last year for them to run acceptably once we upgraded. All new Macs we've purchased in recent years come with 4GB RAM minimum, anyway, if that tells you anything. The Mavericks specifications (there is no such info available for Yosemite) indicate a minimum of 2GB, to cover some of the older Macs, but I can't see how a usable system can run on such sparse memory - too much RAM to disk swapping.\nRAM is inexpensive, too, so it's a good investment.\n\nA: Yosemite needs a minimum of 4gb to run smoothly IMO, however 8gb is better if you're a power user. \n", "Q: Can I change the resolution of a png from 120x120 to 180x180?

Something else has gone wrong here, and I doubt it's iPhoto. After installing Yosemite, did you do other things with it successfully, like browse the web, open a Word document?\nFrom the screen you describe, the HD is the problem.

Is it possible to use iTunes to do this without updating the operating system and if so is there anything I should watch out for? Otherwise, is there some other third party application that I could use instead?\n\nA: *\n\n*You cannot reset your phone, or it will need you to change to latest iOS 8. Apple doesn't sign old iOS versions which means it's impossible to restore an old iOS version.  \n\n*If you want to just wipe the texts and contacts, that's an easier task. \n\n\nIf you have ever synced your iPhone with iTunes, you just need to sync it in the following fashion:  \n\n\n*\n\n*if you usually sync the contacts and texts, you could uncheck the contacts and texts sync and erase those manually.\n\n*if you don't usually use iTunes, or need a faster approach to delete everything, I'd recommend using iTools PC/Mac app. (Just Google it).\nFinally, you should use a blank space wipe tool (such as Battery Doctor) to assure that no erased data remains on the device. \n", "Q: Easily review large set of short sound files I have a large set of mp3s that I need to listen to and evaluate.

It is a bit of a pain to customize (it uses XML), but it is just as powerful as AHK. It can also move the mouse. \n", "Q: Is there a way to remove App from iTunes Connect? Accidentally I used wrong naming convention for my Bundle ID in my App, and I want to delete that App from iTunes Connect, is it somehow possible? I already removed from developer.apple.com > Identifier > App IDs that certain Bundle ID. What else I can do?\nApp is still in Prepare for Submission state.\n\nA: New feature is added by Apple to delete an app from iTunesConnect.

Is there a way to go back to retrieve these files? All my business files, pics and personal files are gone.\n\nA: The Installation of new operating system will normally not touch your files.\nWhat it might have happened is you created a new user account and all your files are in the old user account.\nIf you have admin privileges you should be able to see the old user account in sys pref users and switch to it.\n", "Q: Where are system UI image files stored? On OS X Yosemite, where are the image files for system UI elements such as buttons, sliders, menus, traffic lights, etc. stored?\n\nA: The resources are stored at\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\nNote there is currently no known way to extract the art from the .car files, as far as I can tell.\n\nA: ThemeEngine is an open source utility that can open and modify these themes.\n", "Q: Yosemite + PCI Serial Card? I have a PCIe serial card in a Mac Pro based on the 16950 that's been working fine up until Yosemite. It's been working with the built-in Apple16x50Serial.kext driver.\nWith Yosemite, it looks like the driver loads okay, but no serial port appears under /dev/, and no IOBSDSerialClient for the card appears in ioreg either.\nAnyone else have the same problem please let me know, or if you have a solution even better. :-)\nThanks\n\nA: Are you sure the driver loads fine? Since Yosemite kexts need to be signed. Check the kextstats man page for the status of your kexts. \nCheck out the TrimEnabler FAQ -- they have quite some information on kext signing and the troubles you might experience due to this.\n\nA: Looks like this was another weird Apple big - Yosemite 10.10.1 resolved the issue.\n", "Q: Seeing SMS messages on iPad and iMessages on iPhone I receive iMessages on my iPad and not on my iPhone. I receive SMS messages on my phone but not on my iPad. This is really bad and has caused me to miss 2 work leads in the last 24 hours. Where's the syncing in that?\nI've read through loads of posts and what people seem to be saying is that as iPads don't do phone numbers, SMS messages will only show up on a phone.  Don't ask me why iMessages can't make it to my phone too.

Latest yosemite and itunes installed on my mac. Want to download all data from iCloud photo library and to disable auto upload future. Is there any way to download all photos and videos all at once?\n\nA: \nIn iPhoto or Aperture preferences on your Mac, select Photos (or Photo Stream) > My Photo Stream > Automatic Import. All of your photo stream photos will import into your Events, Projects, Photos, Faces, and Places folders in iPhoto or Aperture.\n\nFrom My Photo Stream FAQ\n\nA: There's a way to do it documented on Tom's Guide\n\nHow to Download Your Photos From iCloud\nhttps://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-download-icloud-photos,news-24697.html\n\nIt's also linked on this Apple Discussion\n\nDownload all your iCloud photos\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7908422\n\nIf you're on a Windows PC it walks you through installing iCloud for Windows and then configuring it to include Photos, login with your AppleID\n\nThere is one very unsatisfactory aspect to the cloud solution which has to do with the file attributes. If you look at the image I just downloaded from my iCloud Photos the creating and modification dates are all wiped out to today's date. I have to instead rely on the image's internal metadata creation date to reconcile this. For video mp4 files there is no such metadata. This wouldn't be so bad if Apple made the sensible choice to timestamp their filenames like you see on Android.\n\nSame story on my Mac\n\n", "Q: Can anyone access Time Machine backups from a stolen HDD? My external drive with all my Time Machine backups has been stolen. Can anyone access this data or will they need my Apple ID and/or password?\n\nA: Short answer - assume YES, and immediately change all your account details, Apple and email ID, cloud access etc. I would also inform your bank, online stores and everyone in your contact book (that they might receive a false comm purporting to be you).\nEven with an encrypted drive, forensic level software and hacks (as used by the Police / Military and available to download), can circumvent most protection. For example, I would start by putting the HDD in any Mac, interrupt boot and attempt to change the encryption / Apple ID at root level. This will circumvent an Admin account password / provide access to the keychain on a Mac and it might work for the physical drive if I got lucky. Or I would try replacing the HDD's circuit board with one from an identical model - if the encryption is managed through memory on the board, its now gone.\nHaving said this, criminals generally fall into too categories, dumb / impatient in which case they wont bother with an encrypted device or capable in which case they will probably be into the data within 24 hours.\nWhen we remove a drive (at work) with any sensitive client data, we physically destroy the internals and spread the pieces or incinerate them. You should bear this in mind if selling your Mac also. Wiped does not mean unrecoverable. Always remove the drive.\n\nA: they can definitely access it (unless you used encrypted files or some non-standard protection).  \n\nA: It depends on two things.\n1) Is the drive encrypted by design? i.e Kingston SSDNow Drives. (hardware encryption)\n2) Was \"filevault\" turned on? If not, then backups aren't encrypted at all.\n", "Q: Is there a way to \"reposition\" the sound source when using headphones? Whenever I use headphones to listen to music or synthetic noise (e.g. one of those white noise / natural sound apps), it sounds like the source is coming from inside my head instead of somewhere \"out there\".\nIs there an app or something that can filter these sounds in real-time and uses 3D audio to \"reposition\" the sound source? So that for example it sounds like coming from real speakers even though I'm using headphones to listen to it. \nPreferably an affordable app for the Mac and not some fancy pro software that only sound engineers use.\n\nA: Have you try the Boom 3D app ? Boom 3D allow you to reorganize your speaker, but I never tested it with headphone... You should try the free trial !\nhttps://www.globaldelight.com/boom/index.php \n\nA: Go to:\nSettings → General → Accessibility. \nThen, under the Hearing section, there is a selection for mono audio \"on\" or \"off.\" You want to turn this \"off.\"\n", "Q: Can't install myEclipse on MacBook Pro with Yosemite After updating to Yosemite, I find that I can't install myEclipse again.\n\nInstallation error:insufficient memory,zero virtual memory.\n\nI also tried the sysctl vm.swapusage command, the result is\n\nvm.swapusage: total = 0.00M  used = 0.00M  free = 0.00M  (encrypted)`\n\nDoes anyone know the solution?\n\nA: Download the installer again.

Mac OS X QuickLook supports the Collada interchange format with .dae file extension out of the box. \nThere is CaniVIZ 3D Preview available for 59$ and there are free standalone viewers for CAD/3D files like eDrawings Viewer. There’s even a plug-in for .stl files popular in 3D printing.\nIs there a free or cheap (< 5 USD) QuickLook plug-in, maybe part of a viewer application, that is capable of formats like .dxf/.dwg, .3ds/.max, .obj, .skp/.kmz?\nHow hard would it be to write or adapt an existing one? SketchUp/3D Warehouse .kmz files, for instance, are .zip archives that contain a .dae file among other stuff. Also, there’s a FOSS project, Meshlab, that should contain the required parsing code for a lot of formats.\n\nA: Try Graphic Converter, at least this one works for previewing the .skp files. In the free version you just need to wait around 30s to use the apps.\nIn some forums, there is said that to generate quicklook plugins, the developer of the apps needs to open up the source code in how their apps generate the files to display. Even maybe if someone is able to reverse engineering the apps to get the source code, there is still problems in terms of licensing. Unless otherwise the code used is under GNU license.\n", "Q: Safari Web Developer Tools - how to edit a cookie? Is it possible to edit cookie values in Safari, either by using the Web Developer tool or another 3rd party extension?\n\nA: You cannot use Safari's Web Developer tools to edit cookies (at least not yet?).\n\nEntries in this table are read-only; if you want to edit a cookie’s value, you need to do so with the document.cookie object in JavaScript (you can use the Quick Console at the bottom of the content browser to modify the cookie and see the results update in real time).

This is a server setting on Exchange.  Depending on how your Exchange server is configured, this might or might not be a setting that you are allowed to change.\nIf you are allowed to change it, you can do so via Outlook Web App.  The instructions that I'm giving here are for Exchange 2013.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open OWA.\n\n*Click the \"Settings\" gear (upper right corner), then select \"Options\".\n\n*In the left navigation pane, select \"Settings\", and then select \"calendar\" in the main pane.\n\n*Scroll down until you see \"automatic processing\".

However, if I click a restart button - it is all fine.\nIt is definitely not a hardware issue and this did not happen on Mavericks ever.\n\nA: On the Yosemite login screen, you should see the current Input Method (keyboard) icon in the upper right corner. \nIf you click on the current input method, a drop-down menu will let you choose which alternate keyboard you can use. That should let you enter it in.\nIf your keyboard isn't listed, the dropdown menu also has an exhaustive list of other input methods, so you can select one that should let it work. \nNote: I haven't tried to change my password to use an alternate keyboard just to see if it works.

This method avoids that message(tested on OS X 10.11.3). The agent calls a shell script every 30 seconds and tries to ping an IP address that is static on the vpn network. If it cannot ping that IP it enables your vpn connection.\nIf you did this through an Apple Script App, the app icon will always be in your dock. I prefer to have this running automatically in the background.\nClone the project below and follow the directions in the readme. The end result is an installer package that will place a launch agent plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ and a shell script in /Library/Application Support/melonsmasher/. \nBe sure to edit the shell script(auto-vpn) with your VPN connection name and an IP address that is on the VPN network.

All good.\nIn Yosemite (OSX v. 10.10) I can open an app that way only if it's in the top level of Launchpad. If I'm inside a folder in Launchpad, I can navigate around using the keyboard but cannot open an app using the return key. Nor can I open an app with command-O or any other key that I can find. (Inside a folder, when I navigate around, the background of the selected app icon turns a light gray instead of a darker gray in the top level of Launchpad. I'm not sure if that is significant in some way.)\nThis is puzzling to me. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.\n[Update, Sept 18, 2016: Launchpad launches apps as expected with the return key in this situation as of OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.5. No more bug.]\n\nA: LaunchPad was designed as a primarily non-keyboard UI for opening apps.\nA drastically easier way to launch an app via the keyboard is to use Spotlight under Yosemite. A simple Command-Space, then the first few letters of the app name, then press return.\n\nA: Just press ctrl+↩ return or ⇧+↩ return to launch the app. Both works for me.\n", "Q: I've upgraded to Yosemite.

I did a clean install of Yosemite (however, I took a bit of a strange path: reinstalled Mavericks and then upgraded to Yosemite via the App Store).\nSo, my problem is that the UI lags. Not immediately, but after a while (either using the laptop or have it in sleep mode and then use it) the UI gets laggy. Yosemite eats up all my RAM, and I don't really have that much apps open. Today, I had 3 PDFs open in Preview and was using Safari. Mission control and Expose were very slow and laggy.\nI have already tried a PRAM reset, did not solve anything. Also reduced the transparancy, and did not work.\nWhen reading forums, it seems that Yosemite has trouble with the amount of pixels of a retina screen. A friend of mine has a 2014 11\" MacBook Air (base model) which runs Yosemite fine.\nWhat do you recommend, should I do a clean install of Yosemite again (this time using a bootable image of Yosemite)? Or is it better to wait for Apple to fix this with an update?\nI'm keen for your thoughts on this matter.\nUPDATE 19-11-2014: Since the 10.10.1 update, overall stability of Yosemite seems to be improved and I have not yet encountered any lag. Is it solved....?\nUPDATE 21-11-2014: Still having UI lag (after clean re-install of Yosemite), though it does occur less frequently with 10.10.1. Preview also performs slightly better, as well as Mission Control and Exposé.\nUPDATE 03-12-2014: UI lag is still present, and as said, it occurs less frequently. What is strange however, is that the actual performance of the machine does not seem to suffer under the lag.\n\nA: I'm experiencing some slowdown after a while even on my MBA. It's exactly how you described it. It's perfectly smooth after booting the machine but eventually, after using it for one day or so the animations (especially launching Mission Control, switching between spaces and full screen apps) get noticeably choppy. I don't think there's anything that can be done about it right now, I made a clean install and even executed an Onyx automation, but the problem persists.  This is clearly an optimization problem in Yosemite and I really hope it will get better with the future updates. \n\nA: I tried the following steps listed here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver*.plist\n\n*Shutdown OSX\n\n*Startup, immediately press and hold the P and R keys while holding\ndown the option (⌥) and command (⌘) keys before the gray boot screen\nappears, which resets the NVRAM\n\n*You may have to reset your display preferences (resolution) once you\nlogin\n\n\nA: Back everything up and do a clean install.

How can I get around that? I created a little script that looks up a random signature from an ever-growing list of quotes I have and modifies the HTML of my signature file to insert the quote into place.  I trigger this script via launchd every few minutes so that my signature is 'randomized' throughout the day.\nUp to Mavericks, this worked fine.  Now, in Yosemite (10.10), the signature no longer gets updated.  If I go into Prefs -> Signatures and drag/drop the signature from the 'All' list on to my mail account again it will trigger it to update.  It also updates when I restart Mail.  It appears that Mail is now caching the contents of the signature file and only refreshes it when it gets 'triggered' to in some way.\nI know that there are now two possible copies of the signature file - a local and iCloud version.  I've updated my script to make sure both are using the updated signature.  If I restart mail or do the prefs trick, it does show the updated quote in the signature, so I know my script is running properly.\nDoes anyone know anything about this cache and/or how I might trigger Mail to refresh the signature with my script or some other trickery?  I'm not even sure where to start looking for this sort of thing.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you. I did some digging around and found a solution that used to work back in the OSX 10.8 days and stopped working with OSX 10.9. Oddly enough, it works again with OSX 10.10.1 and Mail 8.1 (1993).\nThere are multiple parts to this - an AppleScript that you compile into an Application, a text file containing your random quotes, two signatures in Mail.app (one is a template, the other is the actual signature for your messages), and the system 'cron' service. (Ideally you should use launchd, but I haven't got that far yet.)\nThe AppleScript:\nif application \"Mail\" is running then\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"~###~\"\n    set myQuote to some text item of (read \"/Users/Steve/.sigs.in\")\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n       set the content of signature \"MySignature\" to the content of signature \"MyTemplate\" & myQuote\n    end tell\nend if\n\nIn my implementation (which you can deduce from the AppleScript):\n\n\n*\n\n*My two Mail.app signatures are called \"MyTemplate\" and \"MySignature\".\n\"MyTemplate\" contains everything that is static - stuff like my email\naddress, etc. \"MySignature\" is the one that I use with my messages.\n\n*The text file holding my quotes is called \".sigs.in\"\n(so that it doesn't appear in Finder windows) and all the quotes are\nseparated by a line holding only \"~###~\". This file lives in my home directory.\n\n*My crontab entry consists\nof * * * * * /Users/Steve/bin/MailRandomSig.app/Contents/MacOS/applet \nThe compiled AppleScript lives in /Users/Steve/bin (obviously enough), and the \"applet\" part is the actual compiled binary that we want to run.\nI've tested this and it works beautifully. Each minute, cron kicks off my compiled script which updates the signature.\nThe only \"downside\" is that if you don't like the quote you have to wait a minute for the script to refresh the signature and then reselect the signature from the drop-down selector in the message composition window. (I have two signatures - one static, the other the output of my script - to get around this.)\n", "Q: How to quit without saving using just the keyboard? When I quit an application (e.g., Excel) with Command-Q, a dialog box pops up, asking me to select between don't save, cancel and save.\nI can hit Enter to select save, or I can navigate the mouse to don't save, but how do I get that without the mouse?\nOn Linux and Windows I can use Tab to switch between the 3 buttons.\nWhat do I do on Mac OS X? \nExcel for Mac 2011 (14.3.8)\nI tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*Tab\n\n*shift-Tab\n\n*control-Tab\n\n*option-Tab\nNo go.\n\nA: It's not the default behavior for tab–I read because someone at Apple felt tabbing \"wasn't magical enough\"–but in the Keyboard preferences, click the Shortcuts tab. Then select All controls to make the Tab key behave the way you want. Or just press control+F7 to toggle this.\n\nIf you are at the following dialog, just hit d...no key-combo necessary.\n\n\nA: Since Lion, the standard key command for Don't Save is  Cmd ⌘   Backspace ⌫ \nPrior to that it was  Cmd ⌘    D  which some apps still respond to.\n\n Ctrl   Tab   will switch between the options, which can then be actioned by hitting  Spacebar  , only if you have All Controls set in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n\n\nA: The standard shortcut for \"Don't Save\" in the dialog you mention is command ⌘+Delete. The old shortcut, command ⌘+D, can be restored by issuing the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool YES\nand to revert back, \ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool NO\nIn Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, command ⌘+D seems to work by default (but the standard shortcut does not).\nBasically, try either command ⌘+Delete for Apple or standard applications, and command ⌘+D if that does not work.\n", "Q: Old Photos synced to icloud I am trying to clean up my Iphone 4S and moving photos to icloud. I tried to create a photo stream but I do not have the option on this phone. any suggestions?\n\nA: Photo Stream is gone since iOS 8.\nEven though your 4S will be on an older OS, Photo Stream is not the way to securely save your photos, as Apple are starting to limit to the last 30 days only. \nI'd suggest Dropbox or similar, or get them onto your computer with iPhoto [Mac] or Photo Gallery - part of Windows Essentials [PC]\n", "Q: Turning on the flashlight with Siri I asked Siri to turn on the flashlight but she answered \"Sorry but I'm not able to do that\". Is there any way to enable Siri to turn on the flashlight? I use an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 8.1.\n\n\nA: A quick dash round google gives me the impression that it could do it in iOS 7 beta 1, but the function disappeared after that & was never in a release iOS.\n\nA: \"Launch Flashlight\" used to work. (You had to download one of the flashlight apps from the App store, as the command would not work for the default iPhone flashlight.)\nApple has now de-activated this convenient feature. Why? Who knows.\nIt was real convenient at night, with the iPhone charging on the nightstand, to simply get some light while in a dark bedroom - like when you wake up in the middle of the night because of a phone call, some noise, or just to go to the bathroom.\n\nA: Have you tried Lumos? I mean, it's worth a try.\n\nA: I just tried \"launch flashlight\" and it worked fine\n\nA: I'm running iOS 9.3, and I have a Flashlight app. (My specific one is Flashlight Ⓞ by iHandy Inc.\nhttps://appsto.re/us/VKmVw.i)\nWith this, when I say, \"Open Flashlight\" it launches the app which in turn automatically turns on the flashlight.\nThis doesn't directly toggle the Control Center flashlight but it works.\n\nA: Just tested this in iOS 12 and it works great. \nYou can also use Siri Shortcuts to say 'lumos' and the flashlight can turn on. \nhttps://twitter.com/bpmarkowitz/status/1015303601839837186?lang=en :) \n\nA: try using the word \"LAUNCH\" instead of turn-on.  She was able to turn on my flashlight app.\n", "Q: Find device information when Activation Lock is activated Is there a way to find the time and date of when Activation Lock was activated on an iPad? Also, can I find the IMEI and serial of the iPad? My iPad has few iCloud IDs and I know just 1 ID. What can I do to get useful information about which iCloud ID caused the iPad activation lock and when? \n\nA: The activation lock screen will display the first few characters and domain name of the Apple ID used to lock the device. This should be sufficient information for you to tell which Apple ID is being requested.\n", "Q: Does Profile Manager for iOS Need to be Accessible over the Internet? We're replacing our BlackBerry handsets with iPhones, and we'll be using OS X's Profile Manager for MDM deployment and management.\nI've done some exploratory research and I'm happy with the general principles, but I'm wondering if the MDM server needs to be publicly accessible for remote management of iPhones, or is the functionality exposed via the carrier?\n\nA: The MDM server does need to be available by the device, but Profile Manager itself does not. In other words, the ability to access the Profile Manager doesn't need to be present on the device, providing the literal MDM server is accessible.\n\nA: The MDM server only needs to be publicly available if you want to send commands to the devices while they are not on your LAN.  Using a solution like Casper, you can have a piece of the MDM (a limited access server) in the DMZ, while the fully functional Casper server is behind your firewall.  \nCommunication with Profile Manager/MDM is a three way conversation.  The devices need to be able to communicate with the MDM server (Profile Manager) and Apple's servers to receive commands.  The MDM Server also needs to be able to communicate with Apple to send tell its devices to check in with the MDM server.\n", "Q: Dropping wifi, replace bcm4331 with bcm4360, MacBook Pro Retina Early 2013 I have a MacBook Pro 13\" Retina, Early 2013, my wifi drops roughly ever 2 or 3 minutes when running ArchLinux (OS X works fine). As far as I know this problem is related to that there are no official drivers available and thus there are no solution out there.\nSo the idea I have is to replace the BCM4331 with a BCM4360 or another alternative that works in ArchLinux and OS X. Is this possible? Would e.g a BCM4360 work in a MBPr Early 2013 with OS X?\nBest regards\nRawa\n\nA: The BCM4360 is known not to work with the b43 driver. The broadcom-wl driver should work, but since the card is even newer, I would expect even more problems. I suggest to pick up a cheap usb wifi stick, that fixed all my problems.\n", "Q: Configuring AirPort Extreme with Existing Router I'm setting up an office network consisting of:\n- ATT ADSL2 Modem -> CISCO Router (198.x.x.x) -> Airport Extreme\n\nI'm having an issue getting the Airport Extreme (6th Gen) to connect to the network. I want to use the AE to serve its own 5Ghz and 2.5Ghz network. The issue isn't configuring the wireless details - it is how to get the airport to connect to the router correctly.\nUpon connecting the AE as a fresh factory default device, it reports:\n\nWhat is the correct method to setting up the Airport Extreme in this instance?\nI've tried the roaming setup on Apple with no success.\n\nA: The airport extreme should be connected as just a device with the cisco router handling DHCP and NAT.  in the airport configuration go to the Network Tab and click the double headed arrow under Router Mode set it to \"Off(Bridged Mode)\n\nYou can then go to Wireless and set that how ever you want all traffic will go to the cisco router and either be forwarded to the Internet or go to the voip, printer, etc.\n\nA: Your Airport Extreme has a link-local address.  \nWikipedia:\n\nFor Internet Protocol (IP) networks, they are assigned most often using stateless address autoconfiguration. In IPv4 they are normally only used to assign IP addresses to network interfaces when no external, stateful mechanism of address configuration exists, such as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), or when another primary configuration method has failed.\n  Link-local addresses for IPv4 are defined in the address block 169.254.0.0/16\n\nJust enter the setup and manually configure an IP-address for the ethernet interface of the Airport Extreme in the same private address range as the ethernet interface in the Cisco router.\nExample:\nIf the IP-address of the ethernet interface (Cisco Router) is 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 assign 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 to the ethernet interface (Airport Extreme)\n", "Q: Can I view iPad screen from Mac?

also experienced these crashes nearly every other day on my mid 2012 MBP.\nThis solved it for me:\nSwitch off \"Automatic graphics switching\" for Battery and Power Adapter\nsettings. This will increase overall power consumption but for me the\ncrashes have vanished.\n\nExplanation: Mac Book Pros (and other Macs) quite usually come with two different GPUs. A low power and a high power GPU. OSX switches between these GPUs on demand. Since Yosemite this seems to be a problem for some people, because their systems are freezing occasionally. If your system suffers from hangs like described by the original poster, try this workaround until Apple fixes automatic GPU switching. \n\n\nA: You may qualify for the MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program. See this for more information https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\n", "Q: How to switch dictation language in Yosemite using a voice command? I write in both English and French, and quite often I need to switch between them. I'd like to know if I can achieve this using a voice command?\n\nA: I am not aware of any keyboard shortcut to do so but as a pis aller you can create a Sikuli script that switches from  English to French, and another one that switches from French to English, then bind those two scripts to a voice command. \n", "Q: Unable to boot Yosemite and old system after Upgrade to Yosemite I have upgraded my MBP 5,1 (2,53 GHz) from Snow Leopard to Yosemite. The install went terribly wrong and now neither a fresh Yosemite, nor a fresh Snow Leopard would boot.\nMoving away /System/Library/Extensions/NVDAResmanTesla.kext in Yosemite or NVDAResman.kext in Snow Leopard makes the system bootable.\nHowver, the graphics under Yosemite are extremely slow and full of artifacts withot this kext, so this is no solution.\nThese are the graphic cards: NVIDIA GeForce 9400M and 9600M GT.\nI am completely lost why this problem can persist fresh installs even of the old OS X version. I have also reset the NVRAM and SMC. What else could the Yosemite install have changed?\nI think it's very unlikely that my graphics card went kaputt just at the same time...\nAlso, the SSD (OWC Mercury EXTREME Pro SSD, 361A13F0) passed all checks.\nThe only other modification to the system is that I don't have an internal DVD drive anymore.

Every time I add a few MBss of files to my SD disk, Spotlight starts eating battery (per Activity Monitor Energy Impact) for one to several days indexing them.\nHow can I make indexing to turn off automatically when on battery power, and enable again when Macbook is powered from an AC outlet?\n\nA: jherran's answer helps you with disabling Spotlight indexing, but does not address the part of the question about toggling automatically when AC power is connected or disconnected.\nYou could use sudo mdutil -i off / and sudo mdutil -i on / in conjunction with a listener for when AC power is disconnected. Using something like ControlPlane will satisfy your requirement for automatic toggling. It supports \"Current power source\" as an event to listen for. It is free and open source.\nYou might be against using a third party solution. To roll your own, try writing a script that loops checking pmset -g ps | grep -c 'AC Power' with a sleep interval in between. If AC is connected, it outputs 1 (0 otherwise).\n\nA: I wrote this script (/Users//bin/control_spotlight_indexing.sh) to toggle on/off indexing based on power source. I also set it up to run as root in a cron job (executed as /Users//bin/control_spotlight_indexing.sh >> /Users//bin/control_spotlight_indexing.log).\nSuggestions for improvements are welcome.\n#!/bin/zsh\n\n# Turn on Spotlight indexing by default\nmdutil -i on /\n\n# Power: 0 is battery; 1 is charger.\npower=$(pmset -g ps | grep -c 'AC Power')\n\nwhile [ true ] ; do\n\n  if [ $power -eq 0 ] ; then\n    # Turn off Spotlight indexing\n    mdutil -i off /\n    # Check every hour\n    while [ $power -eq 0 ] ; do \n      time=$(/bin/date)\n      echo \"[$time] Battery: Spotlight indexing is OFF.

I typed /sbin/fsck -fy because it was supposed to fix my Mac so that it is no longer stuck in safe boot. It said to type reboot, but now my Mac won't start outside of recovery mode. I need help trying to recover data and starting the computer.\n\nA: Running the command   /sbin/fsck –fy   initiates a file system consistency check utility which should scan your system and attempt to repair any issues, this scan is documented to take approximately 15 minutes and should not be interrupted.\n\nYou should restart your computer, press the power button, and then immediately press and hold the  Command + S  keys as the computer starts up.  This will boot you into Single-user mode and you should see white text on the screen.  Now run the fsck utility and wait.\nWhen it's done it should prompt you with the message \"File System was modified\" or \"No problems were found\".  If you see the first message, you should repeat the entire process over and over again until you receive the \"No problems were found\" message.  This may take 3 or more times of repeating the process.  \n\nIf after 5 times you still do not get the No problems were found prompt then your last hope is to attempt a Disk Repair.\nFind a OSX install disc, and insert it, restart, holding down the  C  key to boot to the disc.  Once it starts up, navigate to the Disk Utility application which will be found in one of the drop down menu's along the top of the window.\nWithin the Disk Utility application select your drive and run the Repair Disk command.  Run it repeatedly until it responds that no errors needed to be repaired.\nIf it still doesn't work, buy a new hard-drive.\n", "Q: What are the RAM requirements for OS X 10.10 Yosemite The minimum requirements for RAM for Yosemite is 2 GB as stated in apple literature.\nWhat are the optimum real world requirements for Yosemite to achieve a noticeable improvement.\nIn particular for an early 2011 MBP 2.3 GHz which currently has 4 GB.\n\nA: Absolute minimum is 2GB... though 4GB would be a more tenable minimum, 8GB more comfortable, 16GB would be able to breathe properly. \n8GB really is the 'minimum sensible' for a modern OS, whatever the official spec says.\n\nA: I have MacBook Pro with Yosemite 10.10.3 with 4 GB RAM. It runs so slowly and it take ages to load the system.\nI recommend at least 8 GB RAM.\n\nA: I have several MBP. Yosemite runs fine with 4GB of ram, very comfortably with 8GB of ram. One of my MBP has 16GB of ram, and has consistently much ram free. Even with photography apps, I am not using 3D apps.\n\nA: 4GB on my 2010 MacBook Air is fine. More is better, and I've upgraded my iMac to 20GB, but there's no real point going above 4GB unless you have an SSD. If you don't have an SSD, you'll get a much better performance improvement from adding an SSD than you will from adding RAM.\n\nA: I don't think add more ram can do much to load the system. As Yosemite can compress physical memory efficiently, 4GB of Ram actually enough for most of the task unless you need to work with 3D or super high-res photo. Save your money to upgrade to SSD, you will feel like you are having a new machine.\nI have 2 MBP at home, Machine A is an i7 with 16G ram. Machine B is a core2duo with 4G ram. Both of them are replaced with a SSD. Compare boot time, they are almost the same (within 3 to 5 sec. difference). Booting Yosemite at around 20 sec. So don't need to bother much on adding ram if you want notiable performance. Replace the harddisk to SSD you will more then satisfied on the result.\n", "Q: Healthkit sync with Strava I am using iOS 8.1 with Healthkit and Strava version 4.2.2 with sync enabled in strava to push cycling data to Healthkit.\nMy cycle data is logged with Garmin which uses garmin connect to sync to the Garmin cloud, and the data is then pushed to Strava cloud and from there can be viewed on the Strava app on iOS.\nHow is the data meant to go from Strava app to healthkit?  \nIs it possible to use strava and healthkit in this fashion?\nNote at this point in time garmin connect does not support pushing data to healthkit.\n\nA: Yes it is possible to link Strava and HealthKit. Load up your Strava app then go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*More\n\n*Settings\n\n*Link other services\n\n*Health should be listed as an option to connect to\n\n\nOfficial Strava link: https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/55624974-Changes-in-Strava-version-4-2-1-for-iOS#health\n", "Q: Convert domain account to local account I see this Apple article on converting a local user account to a network user account: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5338\nHowever, I'd like to do it in reverse. I'm comfortable with some of the steps, but for example this I'm not sure what the opposite is:\nsudo scp -Epr /Users/username root@server.example.com:/Users/username\n\nWhat are the steps required to convert a domain user to a local user on Yosemite?\n\nA: Sierra must have changed something because this did not work. The account attempts to log in, then there were a ton of messages asking for the admin password because the Library needed to be repaired. Then there was an error that a valid keychain could not be found (because the account did not have access to any of its own folders.) In the past, an ACL reset would fix that, but that's not possible with Sierra (or at least I haven't found a reliable way to do it.)\nWhat I did instead was:\n\n\n*\n\n*From an admin account, delete the Mobile User account, but do not delete the home folder.\n\n*From Terminal, rename the user's home folder to remove the \"(Deleted)\" tag. You can also rename it to anything you want at this point, such as \"johnspartan\" instead of \"spartanj117\"\n\n*Create a new local account, using the same name as the account you just edited. Select \"Use Existing Folder.\" (If you don't see the prompt, you mistyped something. Cancel and double-check the previous step.)\n\n*Log out of the admin account, and log into the newly created account. All should be there, minus the Mobile account tag.\n\n\nA: The instructions below apply in a situation where the user had a \"mobile\" account that has already been synced to the client machine so that the local home directory contained all the data needed by the user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in the client machine as a local administrator. Make sure the user you are going to change is NOT logged in :-)\n\n*Do a backup!!! (e.g. by running TimeMachine)\n\n*From the Terminal, execute the id <user> command, where <user> is the name of the mobile user. Make a note of the User ID and primary group ID numbers. \n\n*In System Preferences, delete the mobile account by selecting it and then\nclicking on the '-' button. Select the \"Don't change the home\nfolder\" option. This will rename the user's home folder on the\nclient to /Users/<user>\\ (deleted). \n\n*Add a new local account. The\nuser name must be <user>. Specify a local password (i.e. not an\niCloud one). \n\n*Right-click on the new local account, \"Advanced\nsettings\" will be shown. Set the user ID to the previous value. \n\n*The\nnew local account now has a new /Users/<user> home directory with\nthe default subdirectories in it. From the terminal as administrator\nremove this new home directory and rename the old \"deleted\" home directory as follows:\nsudo rm -rf /Users/<user>\nsudo mv /Users/<user>\\ (deleted) /Users/<user>\n\n\n*(Optional): the default group for new users is Staff, gid=20. You may need to change this if necessary. Use the Directory Utility tool to add/edit local groups.\n\n\nA: I tried this script on macOS Catalina (10.15.2) and it worked perfectly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into a local admin account other than the account to migrate.\n\n*Download and run this script, and follow all of the instructions\n\n*Once it is finished, reboot your computer into Recovery Mode (command + R)\n\n*Open Disk Utility, mount your primary drive, and run First Aid\n\n*Reboot and use as normal\n\n\nAccording to the author of the script, it modifies the account itself by removing all of the AD affiliations, instead of deleting the account and migrating the data.\nWhen running the script, you will most likely see a bunch of chown: Permission denied errors. The ownership of the files and folders in your /Users/<username> directory will be changed, but the filesystem permissions need to be flushed. There is a specific command you can run in Terminal if you feel like looking it up, but running First Aid in Recovery Mode is much simpler.\n\nA: Be careful! Both answers above have problems because in the end they do the same thing. At this point, the shorter four step procedure is better.\nI cannot comment on the changes between Sierra and previous versions, but both suggestions have an issue with the UUID that is assigned accounts. \nThere are three numbers which identify a user on Macs, the first are the uid and gid mentioned on the longer procedure above, The longer procedure essentially manually recovers the uid/gid to the previous values, the in the second procedure the system will reassign the uid/gid combination on all files in the home directory for you. This is great if the only thing you are worried about on the server is the users files.\nThe problem is the third user identifier, which is used by most of the Server services to identify the user. Both procedures above assign a new UUID to the account, meaning that all services will need to be reconfigured from scratch. For mail, you need to delete the old network users and add the new local ones, but you will then lose all mail stored on the server for the user. Therefore, before proceeding, you need to move all mail to an on my Mac store or export it somehow, then make the user changes and move the mail back again. The same holds true for all other services provided by that server.\n\nA: This script did the trick for me.\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/migrating-ad-mobile-accounts-to-local-user-accounts/\n", "Q: Does restoring from an iCloud backup enforce installation of the latest iOS?

You can pretty much sync Notes, Calendar, and Messages and also find a placeholder stub of all apps installed on your iPhone that will all have the download cloud down arrow icon present on their tiles in the Home Screen. What is conspicuously missing (and I have no idea why they would even omit this) is the Photos app's images and videos. Also missing is local Files saved on the iPhone. There's probably other omissions I haven't yet figured out.\nThis was one of the major reasons why I even bothered buying an iPad to have a scratch pad surface to restore deleted photos off my iPhone that could be restored from a backup. Now I have to use a scratch iPhone device to retrieve these images which got botched in an AirDrop transfer. Either that or backup locally to another PC, restore the old backup from this PC and overwrite my iPhone and hope I can retrieve those deleted photos in a safe way and then overwrite my iPhone again with the new backup. All this could be avoided if iTunes could do selective restores rather than the whole all or nothing solution it currently offers. It would be awesome to just be able to restore photos, or messages, or notes or whatever subset from the backup you wish to restore and merge into a given device.\nWhen you go to attempt a restore from an iPhone backup iTunes will prompt you with the following dialog\n\nRestore from Backup\nChose a backup to restore. This will restore only the contacts, calendars, notes, and settings, not the iPad firmware.\niPad Name [pull down list of backups on the PC]\nLast Backed Up. MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM\n[Restore] [Cancel]\n\nYou may also see\n\niTunes\nSettings and data from some apps are not compatible with iPad and will not be restored.\n[Continue] [Cancel]\n\nIt would be great to actually have that determination made explicit so you can see what data and apps are specifically going to be omitted from the restore operation. Which apps and data specifically are compatible/not compatible.\n", "Q: How can I transfer music from one iphone to another if it has NOT BEEN purchased from iTunes (ie., songs that were put on there from cd's I own etc.) Is there a way to transfer songs from one iphone to a new iphone that were NOT purchased from iTunes?  I am talking about songs that were from cd's that I or my son own.  They are on my old phone but will not transfer to the new phone because they weren't iTunes purchases.  If this is a \"feature\" of an Apple iPhone, I can understand peoples frustrations.\n\nA: Only one \"library\" or subset of one library can exist on a single mobile  device. You can manage your non-iTunes purchased music and move it to your device through iTunes.  But you can not move it from device to device, or device back to PC.  Why not?  Doing so could promote piracy of songs (media).\nYou can only normally transfer music in one direction: iTunes -> Device. The reason for this is to limit music sharing, this follows the model apple created to satisfy the recording industries demands as apple demanded an end to DRM encrypted files.\nAdditionally, related but not part of your question, you are essentially prohibited from transferring songs from someone else's iTunes library directly to your phone.  If you attempt to do so it will warn you that you are about to replace the existing library on the device with a new one, meaning all song currently on the device will be wiped if you continue.\nIf the original iTunes files are not available on the computer, you can't just transfer them from the device back to iTunes. There are however apps in the app store that allow you to transfer music back to a PC, at that point you can use iTunes to put it on the new phone. I can't personally suggest any of these as I've never used them. Google the term iphone transfer music to pc to learn more and read reviews.\nAnother method if the original CD's are still available you could use iTunes to re-rip them to iTunes on the computer, and then move them to the new phone.\nApple also sells an add-on called iTunes Match that will allow you to download songs in your ripped library directly to your device.  However this service isn't a necessity at all, it just adds convenience over managing your library directly thru iTunes. \nThis is my opinion on the subject, but if a person understands how the system works, it's not hard to follow the rules, but it does seem confusing when a person is replacing their phone and doesn't know the rules.  I would also rather have this system in place than DRM encoded music downloads from the app store.\n\nA: I may have a solution with the already described way of re-importing transferred playlists and songs from the device to a Mac to put them onto another device. That includes a 3rd party software.\nWhen I get a new MacBook Pro at work, I use the software \"iExplorer\" to transfer all my contact data from my iPhone 5 back into the new Macbook Pro. That also does work with images for iPhoto and even with the whole music library including the playlists. \nNice thing with this software is, you can select what to transfer and you have the complete control over your device, you can even save back the apps and their preferences. For that complete set of features I did not mind to pay $35. \nAs I recommended this tool multiple times before in postings I have to state that I am not affiliated with MacroPlant in any way, but I really love that thing and I can only recommend it! :) \nWith onboard magic it is hardly possible to do the required task. \n\nA: Actually you can with the help of itunes. Add songs into iTunes library and connect your new phone with computer, and then transfer the musis songs to it. But you need make sure these songs are accepted by your phone, what I means is they are M4A file type, otherwise, they cannot be added into either iTunes or your phone.\n", "Q: 'Macintosh HD' not bootable anymore after installing Yosemite on a second disk So I installed a second HDD that I plan on eventually using as my main system disk and did a fresh install of Yosemite on it. The thing, is that I'd like to boot back into the original Macintosh HD so I can start going through what needs to be migrated. I can browse the disk through finder (at least the folders I have permission for), but I can't boot off of it anymore. When I go to Systems---> Settings--> Startup disk. Only the new drive is listed. Even if I reboot and hold down option, it's the same thing.\nDid something happen to to the original Macintosh HD disk after installing Yosemite on a separate drive? \nI'm just worried that even if I can't boot into it anymore, I'd still like to be able to pull stuff from my old home folder, but it's saying I don't have permission. What's the workaround for that? I'm using the same login credentials on the new installation that I was on the old one. \n\nA: Open up Terminal.app, in /Applications/Utilities, and enter the following:\ndiskutil list\n\nIt should show both of your drives and give you information about partitions. You may also want to try:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nOn Yosemite, some of the volumes are defaulting to Core Storage, which can span multiple drives. I'm not saying you did this, in fact I rather doubt, or at least hope you didn't, was inadvertently convert both drives to a single, huge volume that's really two drives.\nI use Scannerz and it comes with another drive management tool called Phoenix. In their release notes for the Yosemite version they said that some systems earlier than Mavericks may not fully be able to see or manipulate files on a Yosemite volume, but a Yosemite volume is supposed to see and be able to manipulate. In other words, if you boot from, say Mountain Lion, you may not be able to do what you want to on a Yosemite volume. I know this is true for stuff in the low level system directories, but I'm not sure it effects user volumes. Maybe they'll put something about this on their web site, but then again, maybe not. I'm not convinced this isn't a Yosemite bug of some sort.\nIf it looks like your volume is intact using diskutil, you might want to restart the system, and immediately hold down the alt key and keep holding it down. A list of bootable volumes should show up and with luck you should then be able to select it and boot from it. Be careful though trying to copy some stuff to the Yosemite volume because like I said the preceding paragraph, it may not work.\n\nA: In an attempt to resolve the issue I would try installing rEFIt which is helpful for inspecting and modifying the regular boot setup.\nI've used it for doing dual installs of OSX/Linux in the past.\n\nA: You can access the backups folders from a working system (at least on Mavericks) as follows. For this example I'm going to use the name \"Backups\" to represent your Time Machine volume. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Finder, click on the \"Go\" menu item.\n\n*From the drop down list, select the \"Go to Folder...\" option.\n\n*Enter the name of the Backup, so for this examples it's:\n\n\n/Volumes/Backups\n\n\n*A Finder window should open with the name \"Backups.backupdb\". Double click on it.\n\n*You should see a folder with the name of your system on it, double click on it.\n\n*A list of all your backups should show up. I would think you would want the one named \"Latest\" but whichever one you want, double click on it.\n\n*You should see a folder with the name of the drive on your old system. Double click on that.\n\n*At this point you navigate it just like you would navigate a regular drive. \n\n\nWhen you find what you want, you can drag it over to anyplace you want to, but you'll have to enter an admin ID and password.\nOne caveat: Apple started hiding the \"Library\" directory from people in their home folders. You may actually have to enter that entire path name in from the base of the Backup. On the other hand you may be able to yank all that stuff out by copying over your entire users folder.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: What is the best way to Charge my MacBook Pro Retina?

I have relatively brand new Macbook pro, I purchased it in late June 2014 and right now it's November 2014. Recently, my Macbook will not keep an internet connection to wifi. There's no problem with the router; I've had no trouble with my iPhone or PC's or even other Macbooks in this house. Additionally, I've noticed the same problem with my computer in other networks, but I can't offer too much information about that, because 99% of the time I have my computer in my house.\nMore details:  \n\n\n*\n\n*There is no pattern for this loss of connectivity. I cannot stay connected more than 15 minutes, and it fluctuates between about 10 and 2 minutes, usually. The time does not change with my activity or lack thereof on the internet.  \n\n*I have tried things like clearing all my wifi passwords and networks, changing my location in network settings, turning off the wifi connection, restarting, and all of these things separately and together. Nothing changes.  \n\n*I first noticed this about a week or two after upgrading to OSX Yosemite (10.10). But it was nothing simultaneous and I've heard of similar problems on other OS's, so I personally can't point my finger to that problem.  \n\n*My Airport Utility is 6.3.4 (634.17) and the card is AirPort Extreme (0x14E4, 0xF5). \n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

The goal is to delete them from the SystemConfiguration folder (so make sure they don't exist in that folder any more!) to force OS X to recreate them, but you'll want to be able to put your original files back in there in case something goes wrong.\n\n*Reboot your computer.\n\n*Turn on Wi-Fi from the menu bar. Good luck!\n\nA: Your product is still under Apple warranty.\nBest course of action is to bring it to Apple Store for service.\nIt sounds like hardware problem anyway.\nMeanwhile you could try some troubleshooting, like start in safe mode and see if it works.\nNext try logging in as another user to see if it is your user profile related.\nAlso you could delete your airport plist in your user Library file and reboot.\nAdded Dec. 27 2014:\nRun a continuous Ping to see if it keeps its connection.\nIn Terminal type ping -i 60 google.com\n and let it run for a hour. (it will send a ping to Google every 60 seconds). \nThe continuous Ping will do following: \nTest your connection to your router, test your connection from router to Google (which is actualy testing your Internet provider).

I restored it and got all of my songs off of icloud. However. Songs I didn't purchase (such as being downloaded from CDs) are in my itunes library on my computer. I have synced my ipod to the computer multiple times with all the songs checked but it only transferred three songs. The rest have a circled '!' on the left and will not show up. How do I get my songs from my library onto my ipod. So I only have what was purchased through itunes on my new ipod.\n\nA: Can you play the songs on iTunes? The exclamation mark means iTunes can't find the file associated with that song. Maybe you moved it or it was deleted, or it lived on another hard drive. The solution is to locate the files for your songs first, and then either re-import them into iTunes or re-link them in iTunes.

Now, Karabiner demands that I install yet another app (SEIL) to remap only the Caps Lock key. I think that is ridiculous and I do not wish to install another app just for remapping one key.\nSo, I removed Karabiner from my system and then set up the following key remap via \"System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Caps Lock = Ctl\n\n*Left Ctl = None (No key binding => dead key)\n\n*Fn stays Fn (NOTE: this doesn't bother me because #1: I don't use it much anyway and, #2: I am used to the Thinkpad \"Fn on far left\" style).\n\n\nBut, I am wondering, how does Karabiner do its magic on the inside. My understanding is that ultimately, Karabiner has to pass the key-remap configuration to the OS, right? Or does Karabiner insert itself into the system (i.e., as a kernel module) and watch all keys typed on the keyboard to detect the Ctl and Fn keys?\nMore importantly, is there anyway (similar to xmodmap in Linux) to achieve this key remap without Karabiner?\n\nA: Sadly, with MacOS Sierra, Karabiner has gone into a strange kind of hiatus-but-not-really-because-someday-we'll-fix-it.\nWhich is too bad, because Karabiner was the perfect tool for what I needed (which was make MacOS behave like a forty-year-old UNIX terminal because my stupid fingers still hit ^W to delete a word and I kill the window and I can't stop, no, don't help me, I'll die eventually and then my problem is fixed). \nMy other main tool is Typinator for abbreviations--w for with, h for the, n for and, etc; those really add up.\nSo far, I've found BetterTouchTool to be a viable replacement for Karabiner, even better in some ways. But worse in others; key repetition doesn't work for me despite the developer saying it does. (Possibly it interacts with Typinator, but turning the latter off doesn’t fix the problem.)\nI've written a whole novel using these two tools (Typinator and BetterTouchTool), but I'd appreciate anyone chiming in if they've found something better still.\n\nA: I'm going to be slightly contrarian and disagree with the sentiment about needing two applications to do what you ask.\nApple adopted the UNIX heritage of one tool to do one thing and Karabiner continues that tradition. Both apps are professional quality, maintained, debugged, documented and supported. Neither app costs anything to try or rely upon. Both do exactly what they say they do.\nLast time I checked, Apple installs thousands of files and has hundreds running before you even log in the first time. Installing 2 programs to totally remap all the keys seems like less of a big deal to me, but I'm open to being wrong about that.\nI would say - install Karabiner and install SEIL and enjoy your ability to remap keys at will, but perhaps I'm missing some deficiency in what you're trying to accomplish.\n\nA: I know this is a late answer, but I'm using Better Touch Tool.  It provides several functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remapping keys: I'm using the new bluetooth keyboard and need the Home, End, and Forward Delete keys that I'm used to on the bigger USB keyboard, so I've mapped ALT-RIGHT-ARROW and ALT-LEFT-ARROW to End and Home and SHIFT-DELETE to FORWARD-DELETE.  While I don't think it lets me remap something like '1' to 'i' (as if I'd want to), it lets me remap function and control keys.\n\n*Remap Magic Mouse Gestures: I used to use 9 Spaces when Apple allowed us to map them into a grid (3 across, 3 down) and hated the new spaces.  I map swipes on the mouse (and some key combinations) so I can move three spaces at once to the left or right.  Even though all 9 spaces are laid out in one long line, to me, it's like I have my old 3x3 grid that worked so well for me.\n\n*Remap trackpad gestures: I use a trackpad a lot and can map the same gestures I use on the mouse to the track pad and even a couple others that work well for the trackpad that don't work on the mouse.\n\n*Remap other devices: It can also work with normal mice, a Siri or Apple remote, and more.\n\n\nIt basically lets you remap almost any form of input to a large number of choices.  I started using BTT to remap only one or two functions and then kept thinking, \"I wish I could do this,\" and found myself remapping more and more.\n\nA: I had to remove Karabiner on macOSX Sierra.  It was making strange problems of a key repeat and acting as if a shift was constantly being held.   I removed the progam and my keyboard problems went away.   \nBut I relied on it for a remap of my right option key as a forward delete -- very handy for editing.  \nI have now solved the problem using Better Touch Tool  -- I made the option + ?  a forward delete (windows delete)   Though not a single key, it works.  \n\nA: If you only need to remap keys which produce text characters, Ukekele is an alternative to Karabiner.  With it you can create your custom keyboard layout and export it as a standard .bundle file that you can then install by double-clicking from Finder.\nOnce installed the layout will appear as a choice under\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Input Source > ➕ (plus button).\nIe, once you created your layout you don't need Ukelele anymore as the .bundle is a regular Apple layout and can be installed on other macs.\n\nThe app can be a bit fiddly to use. What worked was File > New from current input source, and the in the dialog that appears right-click the layout and pick > Set keyboard name and script and make sure you select Unicode under script. To redefine a key double-click it with the mouse and then type the desired key. You can also redefined the keys emitted on Option+key — most of them aren't mapped to anything useful, and can be mapped for example to any emojis or Unicode characters you need to use often.\n\n", "Q: iPad update/restore iOS 8.1 stuck at 10%; cannot exit recovery mode I wanted to upgrade my iPad from iOS 7 to iOS 8.1.

With it you can't run any unsigned drivers and Splix is being a port of Samsung GDI open sourced driver is just a driver and last version being from 2008 it is definitely unsigned.\nBasically you have no choice but disable kext signing if you want to use the printer. Make sure you absolutely have to do it and you don't have other options since this change is system wide and system is becoming less secure after that.\nIn Terminal:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nAnd reboot. Then try to go with Splix.\n\nA: I am on Yosemite and wasted my whole day with this and finally came up with a simple but interesting solution. \nSince there is no other option, I used an application like WMware Fusion (or  Parallel Desktop). You can install any version of windows. For instance, I installed the good old Windows XP. As long as your printer's legit driver is available for that version of windows everything is fine. Just install your Xerox printer in the Printers option (Control Panel) and that's it!!! Just print everything in there.\nIt works much faster than when I used with an emulation file of some other weird generic printer. No fonts problem either, all are original. \nUntil Xerox solves this, this will be my solution for now. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut not working in yosemite Here is the screen shot and it's not working anymore after upgrading to Yosemite\n\nNOTE: Although if I add this shortcuts under all applications then it works.\nI don't know why it's not working, wasted my time and I found on apple discussion forum that in Languages there should be only one language and that doesn't work for me.\n\nA: I have reported this bug to apple and it's still not being closed. I will update my answer once it's closed.\nTill then you can add this shortcuts under all applications(instead of preview) then it will work. \n\nA: I don't know why this isn't working either, but I ran into it with Mavericks too.\nI've tried both \"…\" (proper ellipses) and \"...\" (three .) and neither of them work.\nSo I made a Keyboard Maestro macro for it instead:\n\nThe key here is that the \"Group\" (labeled \"1\") is set up to only be active in Preview.app.\nThen the macro (labeled 2) is where we explain what we want to have happen.\nThe \"Trigger\" (3) in this case is the same keyboard shortcut (aka \"hot key\") ⌘ ⇧ Z but could be anything\nThen the action is to trigger the menu item Tools ---> Adjust Size...\n(The \"Stop macro is menu cannot be selected\" might seem superfluous since there are no more actions after this one, however, if that happens, Keyboard Maestro will show an error to the user, which can be helpful. Otherwise it just silently fails.)\nYou can download my Keyboard Maestro macro here. Unzip it, double click on it to import it into Keyboard Maestro, and it will create the \"Preview only\" group and add the macro to it.\nI still don't know why the official Keyboard Shortcut doesn't work in Preview.app, but an added bonus of using Keyboard Maestro is that since it can sync (using iCloud Drive or Dropbox), you can have it on all of your Macs. Keyboard Shortcuts added to the OS X System Preferences don't sync. Yet another reason I like Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: I had a shortcut in Mavericks (option+T) to bring up the Tags box in Finder. Yosemite killed it, whether All Applications or Finder. Apple Support could not solve it, however I discovered that it will work if set to control+T instead.\n\nA: If using keyboard with number pad use the numbers on the top not the number pad.

After a while or a restart the window is back to stock settings.\nIs this a bug? Because I can't recall experiencing this in previous versions of OS X.

GFX does a great job at that.\n\nA: This is a bit of guesswork, as I don't have a dual GPU machine to test with - but this works across even different computers using the same screen.\nThe difficulty may be in persuading the system to swap profiles at the same time as it swaps GPUs.\nThe way to do this accurately would be with a hardware colorimeter, designed to test & balance the screen, then save a new custom profile.\nThe 'quick test' to see if that would be worthwhile & if the profile swap can be automated, would be to attempt to manually colour balance for each card & test if the profile swap can be done - either automatically or at least manually without too much effort.\nYou can use gfxCardStatus to force the GPUs to switch for testing.\nThen use System Prefs > Displays > Color > Calibrate... & attempt to manually calibrate for each card.\nIf you can get it close enough to match each GPU manually, then all you need is to check the switching mechanism - whether the system will switch over automatically with the GPU.\nIf the switchover is automatic, or even an acceptable manual switch, but you cannot get the 2 GPUs to match closely enough by eye, then the hardware colorimeter would be the only way to get closer.\nThey are not cheap - entry level would be 80 - 100 bucks for something like a ColorMunki Smile, next up would be something like the Spyder\n[If you're Googling for colorimeters, don't get the HueyPro, it no longer works with Yosemite.]\n", "Q: Remote app won't connect, says \"Turn on home sharing\" After an update installed, none of my iOS devices recognize my Apple TV from the Remote App. They just say \"Turn on Home Sharing...\"\nWhen I go through the \"add remote\" wizard, I see a disabled music icon.

Is this at all possible with an OS X machine? I have read that Kinesis foot pedals (e.g. this one) cannot be used as modifiers in combination with other keyboards. Is this correct? If so, why?\n\nA: I created my own \"keyboard combiner\". It lets me use the Kinesis Savant Elite Triple Foot Pedals for shift, alt, and command modifiers on a Mac.\nhttps://github.com/davidbkemp/KeyboardCombinerArduinoSketch/wiki\nIt is quite easy to assemble, but I cannot guarantee that it will work for you. It certainly does not work with some pedals and some keyboards.  For the Kinesis pedals, you will initially need to configure them to act as shift, alt, and command keys, and that means using a PC to do the initial configuration.\n\nA: Definitely possible, there's this great ControllerMate software that lets you assign keys and keyboard shortcuts to various pedals.

When I scale a screenshot of the same image from my iPad 3 retina to that on my MB Air the resulting image appears more saturated (unsure if it's a uniform saturation). Why does this happen? Can I transform my screenshot from my LCD monitor to match a screenshot from my iPad 3 by changing the resolution, saturation, contrast, etc?\n\nA: You could, but how would you know which is correct?\nYou would need accurate profiles for both screens. This could be done with colorimeter hardware/software, something like ColorMunki (No affiliation, it's just what I use myself), which can calibrate both your Mac & iPad screens [also PCs, if you have them]\nAn app like Photoshop [& possibly Gimp, though I've never used it] could then do the translation between the two, though once your screens are correctly calibrated, you may not need to.\n", "Q: Installing gprof on Mac I would like to install GNU Profiler (gprof) on Mac.

It's not in iTunes preferences, and I've just changed my Apple ID first name from 'Thomas' to 'Tom' and that hasn't changed it.\n\nA: I wanted to do this too (I changed my first name), and stumbled on a solution somewhat accidentally:\nFirst, I changed my Apple ID first name at http://appleid.apple.com/ (as you already have).\nNext (wondering whether or not the name change had taken effect anywhere), I went to look at my account information. It should ask you to log in. For me, that is when iTunes figured out my name had changed; it updated immediately.\nBased on this, my guess is iTunes just doesn't bother to check whether or not any details surrounding your Apple ID have changed except for at log in, so when you do that, it should just update.\n", "Q: What is changing ComputerName?

I have several movies that I would like to see on my iPad. I figured the best way to upload to iTunes, but when I launch iTunes on my iPad I cannot see or find them. \n\nA: I don't believe there is any such thing as \"uploading\" to iTunes on the Mac. Rather, you import/add your own video files to your library or purchase them from the iTunes store.\nAny movie or tv show purchased from the iTunes store should automatically be in your Mac iTunes library and also be able play on your iPad after you sync it there. \nYou can import pretty much any movie file of your own to your Mac iTunes library. From there, you can use iTunes to sync it to your iPad; however, your iPad can only play a few specific movie formats (scroll down to TV and Video). If your movies aren't in that format, you won't be able to play them on the iPad whether you sync them or not.\nOnce your iPad is connected to your Mac, you have options in iTunes on the Mac to auto-sync certain playlists of videos or all videos to your iPad.

If you followed the very last instruction in the guide you linked and were not given the option to boot from the disk, then either your Mac doesn't support USB boot or you ran into a restriction of the EFI firmware. awesomebing1 is spot-on regarding why your external drive is unreadable and for the steps to reclaim the drive, but if there was data already on it, consider it lost.\n\nA: \"UNetbootin for Mac OS X can be used to automate the process of extracting the Ubuntu ISO file to USB, and making the USB drive bootable.

I see there are the movie trailers but those seem much shorter (around 30 seconds) and I don't see a way to make it longer.\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: If you like the movie trailer format but you want to customize the length of the clip segments, you can convert the special movie trailer project into a normal iMovie project by going to (File>Convert Trailer to Movie).  \nVideo Tutorial about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lBbqgqgTVA\nOtherwise you need to edit your project manually. A trick to limit the length of a project is to first insert a blank image into your project and to make it the length you want your video to be. Then you can start adding clips to your project by dragging the clips over the blank image (if it doesn't cover the clip completely select the cutaway function). This method can help your project stay a certain time length.\n", "Q: New Mac Mini (late 2014) sound input - says \"No input devices found\" I have just bought a new Mac Mini Late 2014.

There is no indication that this iPhone is related to the olympics at all. Changing the carrier logo is relatively easy.\nTo change the carrier to a logo using a mac on a non jailbroken iPhone, use the following tool: http://uhelios.com/downloads/.\nTo change the carrier on a jailbroken phone, use the tool Zeppelin. A how to can be found here: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2013/12/change-iphone-carrier-logo-ios-7-zeppelin.html.\n\nA: This is likely a jailbroken iPhone which has had a tweak installed (such as the Zeppelin tweak for iOS7) which allows the user replace the Carrier logo with any logo of their choosing.\n", "Q: How to edit the hosts to block IP address?

Like how can I block certain IP address like 17.154.66.79?\n\nA: Technically, OS X can make use of /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files that will  work with standard resolvable hostnames. For blocking IP addresses, using iptables is the usual method but apparently Apple deprecated its use beginning with Lion and switched to pf for this function. Check and read the links in this thread on SuperUser for info on using pf and perhaps a GUI front-end for it.\n\nA: Little Snitch (or similar) blocks IP addresses & IP Ranges for both outgoing & incoming connections. \n\nA: You may execute a reverse DNS lookup to determine a hostname you want to block.\nUse a web service like reverse DNS lookup or 'nslookup' to get a hostname.\nnslookup:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Start Terminal.app and enter nslookup\n\n*At the prompt enter server 8.8.8.8 (this defines which dns-server to use to do the reverse DNS lookup. 8.8.8.8 is a google name server)\n\n*At the next prompt enter an ip-address\n\n*Now you'll get the host name you need for your hosts file\n\n\nExample output:\nuser$ nslookup\n> server 8.8.8.8\nDefault server: 8.8.8.8\nAddress: 8.8.8.8#53\n> 93.220.102.55\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\n55.102.220.93.in-addr.arpa  name = p5DDC6637.dip0.t-ipconnect.de.\n\nIf you add 127.0.0.1   p5DDC6637.dip0.t-ipconnect.de to your hosts file you will prevent your computer accessing my web server.\nCaveats:  \nA lot of ip-addresses and correspondent host names can't be tied to a special computer/host. Mine change at least every 24 hours.\nA today hazardous site/hostname might be a valuable one in the future but unaccessible for you.\nSome ip-addresses are tied to several hostnames with the consequence that you won't be able to detect the name you actually want to block.\n", "Q: How to tell if a Retina MacBook Pro has gone to sleep when the lid is closed? When I shut the lid on my Retina MacBook Pro (2014), how can I tell it's gone to sleep correctly?\nOn my previous MacBook Pro (~2008), the fans were audible, and there was a sleeping LED indicator in the lid latch that changed from \"on\" to \"pulsing\" when it was asleep. I used this as an \"okay\" sign to put it in the laptop bag.\nIs there anyway to tell if a more recent MacBook Pro is asleep? I can't hear the fan most of the time, and I can't see any externally visible indicator lights that would indicate it's status.\nI'm worried if it hasn't sleep correctly when I close the lid (occasionally this would happen with my old laptop) it will overheat when I put it in my bag.\n\nA: It won't just overheat in its bag, but will also quickly drain its battery.\nI always press the power button for about 1 to 2 seconds before closing the lid. The screen will go dark when you release. If you hold it too long, a dialog will come up asking if you want to sleep or shutdown. Choose wisely.\n\nA: One solution I have found is using a Yubikey. When the laptop is on the little press button glows. After shutting the lid it turns off after 20 seconds or so.\nThe Nano version also glows from what I can tell, and is small enough to leave in the USB slot permanently.\n(Edited to add): This may not be the best idea. The yubikey acts appears as a keyboard to the OS. Had an issue recently where I'd closed the lid, but must have touched the yubikey, which behaving like a keyboard, woke the laptop back up with the lid closed. I didn't have time to test, but I feel like it would have stayed awake if I'd left it.\n\nA: I've found for the newer MacBooks with USB-C is this \"nonda USB Type C to USB 3.0 Adapter with Indicator LED\" on amazon (ASIN# B015Z7XE0A).  It has an indicator led that turns off once the machine has gone to sleep.\nI have to strongly disagree with Alphaman on his answer (sorry I can't comment or vote here yet).\nI lost my 2010 MacBook Pro to exactly this issue.  The system didn't go to sleep and remained awake in my briefcase until it died.  The next day, it was failing selftest and I had to take it into the Apple store.  Their diagnostics showed that the motherboard went into thermal shutdown, but the GPU was permanently damaged.\n\nA: I don't think these laptops are quite capable of just 'failing to go to sleep' (it's not a problem I've ever read about before at least). If the lid is closed, it will go into that state, and it'll be safe to put in a bag.\nOne thing that might be worth a try is hunting around the system preferences to see if anything has the ability to take a laptop out of sleep mode, such as a bluetooth connection or receiving some data. Turning that off would stop the sleep problem.\nI've checked the laptop all over, and the ridiculously useful light is gone. Future sucks.\n", "Q: Does Apple still support 10.5.8? Have a friend that's running OSX 10.5.8 and claims it's still supported by Apple and has the same security patches as needed as any other version of OSX. Does Apple still support 10.5.8? What if any know security holes are there? Does Apple have a public statement on which OSX versions are supported, how, and what this means to the user, in the context of  OSX 10.5.8?\n\nA: You can see the complete list of Apple security patches at this page: http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht1222\nYou can see for yourself that the last security patch for OS X 10.5.8 was \"Leopard Security Update 2012-003\" that was released in May 2012.\nThere is likely to be a large number of unpatched security holes in Leopard at this point. However it is unlikely that Apple would publish such a list and I'm not aware of anyone else who maintains such a list.\nAnother issue is that third party software developers may not support Leopard anymore. For example, the current versions of Chrome and Firefox both require a minimum version of 10.6, while the latest version of Safari that runs on Leopard is v5 while the current version is v8. And the last time Safari 5 saw a patch on Leopard was also May 2012 according to the Apple support document above.\n", "Q: iPhone/iMessage question If I lost my iPhone and suspended the number but iMessage from my laptop, do the iMessages I send from the laptop continue to be sent to my phone? \nThe people I iMessage are getting the messages as my number--which I suspended. I'm confused because I don't want someone to find my iPhone and have all of my messages and information along with my apple ID.\nI have not tried to contact Apple yet but that will be my next step.\n\nA: iMessage is connected with your iCloud E-Mail-Address as well. So if somebody unlocks your iPhone, this person will see all of your messages.\nThis Apple Support document describes the ways necessary to stop iMessage on your lost phone:\n\nIf you didn't turn off or deactivate iMessage before switching to a\n  non-Apple phone, other iOS devices will still try to use iMessage to\n  send text messages to your phone number.\nIf you still have your iPhone, follow these steps to turn off iMessage\n  and deregister your phone number:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If you transferred your SIM card from the iPhone to a non-Apple\n  phone, put it back in the iPhone.\n  \n*Make sure that you're connected to the cellular data network. \n  \n*Tap Settings > Messages and turn iMessage off.\n  \n  \n  If you don't have access to your iPhone, or if you can't deactivate\n  iMessage from your iPhone, please contact Apple Support.

The WindowServer process, which is responsible for drawing everything to the screen, issues a notification announcing that change to every process with a GUI and expects an acknowledgement of the notification. These Chrome processes don't respond, so the operating system flags the processes as \"Not responding\".\nLong story short is that they think this is just a cosmetic problem that will be fixed shortly. It doesn't actually seem to affect performance.\nThey've found and fixed similar issues in the past, for example 304860. I think this is a side-effect of the multi-process architecture that they use for Chrome.\n\nA: It seems like the problem is now fixed with Google Chrome Version 39.0.2171.65 (64-bit). Mine wasn't updated automatically from version 38, so \n\nJust uninstall and download new one then install\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nA: Wired.com has a succinct article here which brings up some interesting points:\n\nThe quick story is that Google Chrome Helper isn’t really the problem.\nIt tends to go on the rampage when there’s a rogue extension or when\nGoogle Chrome’s plug-in settings are configured to run everything by\ndefault. ... but most users in the Help Center forums seem to run into trouble when it’s working with Flash content.\n“Google Chrome Helper” is the generic name for embedded content that runs outside the browser. Browser plug-ins aren’t features that are rendered by HTML code; they involve content that needs to be pulled in from elsewhere. ...\n\nThe fix:\n\nDisabling Helper’s auto-helping is easy, and it won’t prevent you from using plug-ins. You’ll just have to opt in to view plug-in content on a case-by-case basis. ... First, shut down all your Chrome windows without quitting the program. In the Chrome menu, go to “Preferences,” scroll all the way down in the menu, and click on “Show advanced settings…” The first item in the expanded advanced settings list will be “Privacy,” and click on the “Content Settings” button right under that. About halfway down the content settings list is a “Plug-ins” entry, which will likely be set to “Run automatically.” Instead, select “Click to play.”\n\nI know this is a lot of copy 'n' paste, but it is some very interesting information.\n\nA: go to chrome://flags\nlook for something with sandbox\nclick disable -> restart chrome\n\n", "Q: Mac Keeps Messages Deleted From iPhone When I delete messages from my iPhone, my Macbook Air keeps copies of the messages, is there a way to enable sync so that when I delete the messages from iPhone they delete on Mac and vice-versa?\n\nA: No. Messages are not synced in this manner. The only sync is whether or not a particular message has been read. Once a message is delivered to a device/computer, it stays on that device/computer until it is deleted specifically from that machine.\n", "Q: Opening windows applications on Mac There's an application for windows only I was wondering if it was possible to run it on my MacBook 2008 on Yosemite. I have tried using VMWare fusion but it is too slow. Are there any faster alternatives? I also don't have any windows computer. Please help\n\nA: You could use BootCamp, but that would require you to buy Windows. The next best thing I can think of trying is Wine, which can run (some) Windows programs on a Mac. To check if your program has been tested to work under Wine, check the WineHQ app database. The database may not include a test of your program, so try running your program using WineBottler (free) or WineSkin (free) which can repackage your Windows exe to a Mac app. Another you can try is Crossover for Mac (Paid, offers Trial) that runs off of the same Wine backend.

How to fix I have an encrypted dmg (Mac OS Extended Journaled) read/write and it shows a size of of 768.46 GB unmounted but only has a mounted capacity of 665.72 GB. I think something may have been corrupted when I resized it from 500GB to 650GB. I attempted through disk utility, which proceeded to appear to freeze, so I let it go for about 15 minutes and then I checked the log and it said \"resize successful\". I then proceeded to check the capacity of the image mounted and it still said 500GB. So next i tried resizing through hdutil which led me to where I am now. Unmounted size of 768.46 GB but a 665.72 GB capacity. Any ideas how I could fix this?\n\nA: I figured it out!\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*In the left-hand panel, select the disk image you would like to resize (the DMG file), then click the Resize Image button in the toolbar, and then enter the new size. Click Log to ensure that it resized successfully.\n\n*Click Open to mount the volume. (You may also mount the volume manually by opening the disk image in the Finder.) Select the volume in the left-hand panel. Notice how the volume's Total Capacity is unchanged. This is where you got stuck.\n\n*Select the disk image again (not the volume).

That's fine except that only my system's administrator user is on the OS volume, all the others are on the users and files volume, so they can't login until that volume has been unlocked.\nCurrently this means that on start-up I need to login as the administrator so that the drives unlock, and then logout and login as the correct user which is is kind of annoying, as really I don't want to login as the administrator at all as it's only there for permissions or recovery).\nThe two non-OS volumes have their keys stored in the system keychain, with CSUserAgent permitted access, however the name of this tool suggests it won't run until a user logs in.\nWhat I'm wondering is whether there's a way to trigger an unlock sooner without having to do something insecure (like put the password into a script)? Since the passwords are in the system keychain, I thought perhaps I could just permit access to the appropriate process, or even that a script run as root (i.e - a LaunchDaemon with RunAtLoad) might be able to unlock the volume(s)?\n\nA: Here is a script that automatically unlocks: https://github.com/jridgewell/Unlock\nUnlock allows the system to unlock and mount Core Storage encrypted volumes during boot.

I'd like to know if the following is possible with Automator. \nI want to be able to move any files, but in my special case videos and photos, from any possible device ( iPhone, iPad, SD card, but perhaps also from other directories) to my NAS, ordered by date.\nEach file type should have a separate directory, eg. \nNAS://imported/video \nNAS://imported/photos \n\nWhat it should also do: within those separate directories, there should be a folder for each date a photo or video will be moved to(and it would also be important that you can customize the date format to yy-mm-dd , dd-mm-yy or the like, before you run the workflow ) \nNAS://imported/video/2014-11-04 \nNAS://imported/video/2014-11-05 \n\nNow every video made on november the 5th should be moved to NAS://imported/video/2014-11-05/video_file1.mp4\nI know that it is no problem to move files by type into certain folders, but I dont know how to create date-specific folders for each file before the move-command.... \nI'm on MacOS 10.10 (Yosemite)\n\nA: This will be difficult with Automator but it is possible. You will need to augment your Automator workflow with Run Script steps involving some other scripting language. That language can be shell script, AppleScript, or another command line capable tool such as perl.\nAlternatively, you may find a third party tool like Hazel is able to help:\n\nHazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically organizing your files according to the rules you create. It features a rule interface similar to that of Apple Mail so you should feel right at home.\n\n", "Q: Chrome tabs being cut off in small viewing area after wake from sleep I've had a recurring issue since last week where I wake from sleep on a new external monitor, and several of my already-open Chrome tabs have their content resized (i.e. into a 600x600 viewing area).\nThis doesn't affect all tabs, but the websites that are affect are not consistent. For instance, Gmail wasn't affected today, yet it was last week when this happened.\nCurrent version of Chrome: 38.0.2125.111; OS X version: 10.9.5.

Having been a PC user for a number of years I'm now seriously considering purchasing an Apple iMac (21.5″, 2.7 GHz). Is it possible to use a USB flash drive to copy files from my Windows 7 PC to the iMac?\n\nA: Absolutely you can copy files from a USB thumb drive to a Mac. They're typically formatted as MS-DOS partitions which a Mac can read and write.\n\nA: There is already a way to do that while taking care of the logistics.\nYes you could use USB flash drive and then do everything your self (making folders and deciding what files go where and what Apple app will open them ect..) or use Apple provided way, with either WiFi or Cable or manual method.\n\nMoving from your PC to your new Mac? Consider it done.\nWith OS X, you can move all the information from your old PC to your\n  new Mac.\nBuilt-in Windows-to-Mac migration in OS X automatically transfers\n  your documents, music, contacts, calendars, and email accounts\n  (Outlook and Windows Live Mail), and puts them in the appropriate\n  folders and applications on your new Mac.

I have Xcode 5.11. If I try to install the newest (6.0) Xcode from the Mac App Store, will I be prompted to keep my current Xcode?\n\nA: No, Xcode 6 on the Mac App Store will replace the existing Xcode installation. Only the Xcode betas install separately (by default) and only downloading Xcode from developer.apple.com and doing the install manually (by copying Xcode from the DMG to /Applications) will prompt you to replace or keep both.\n", "Q: Disabling warnings in iWork Is there any way of disabling the warning popups in the current versions of Numbers, Pages and Keynote that popup when files are opened? For example:\n\nThey are pretty useless warnings, in the sense that they have never changed how I worked with a document in a given session, so was hoping I could simply shut them off. Maybe a hidden preference?\n\nA: If you save out the files in a Pages format you will not get the errors. You generally only get those errors when trying to open documents from Microsoft Word or something similar. I am pretty sure there is no way to disable the warning though from the preferences or anything.\n", "Q: Apply Computer Name and local hostname with System Image Utility I am going through trying to create a NetInstall image using System Image Utility and am curious about how the \"Apply Computer Name and Local Hostname settings from a file\" option works under the Apply System Configuration Settings task in the Automator Library.\nCould anyone perhaps give some insight about how this works?\n\nA: Try this format:-the Order is MAC Address, hostname (fqdn or not), Computer name (optional), Bonjour name (optional)\n00:2c:76:8d:28:3b -automatic- Computer 1 Computer 1\n00:2c:76:8d:28:2b -automatic- Computer 2 Computer 2\n00:2c:76:8d:28:1b -automatic- Computer 3 Computer 3\n", "Q: Is it at all possible to open a 3rd party iPad app in a mac (xcode emulator, for example) Someone asked me this - I think the answer is no for a number of reasons, but I wanted to confirm. Is there any way to open an iPad app on a mac desktop or laptop?\nFor example I download a publisher's ipad reader - call it the WSJ's, for example - could I run it on my iMac and buy issues etc?\n\nA: You can't. IPAs downloaded from the App Store are built for the ARM processor in actual iOS devices. The iPhone Simulator is not an emulator and can't run ARM code. You will need to compile your own app from the source code, so unless the app is open source you will not be able to do this.\n", "Q: How do I get my computer name to show correctly in the finder? I recently upgraded to Yosemite and following that upgraded to an SSD drive. Life is good and I am happy with everything except that since the upgrades I am seeing a silly variety of names for my computer.\nI renamed it to The Shire and now it shows up as The Shire(2) or The Shire(3).

Help me please!\n\nA: If you hold the Option key while booting does anything appear? If not you may have damaged the partition. Since your computer is a 2010 model it is not capable of using Internet Recovery. Your only option would be 1) Call Apple support and ask them to ship you an OS X install DVD (you will have to pay for it) or 2) if the install DVD fails you may have messed up your HDD and may need to buy a new one.\nAll in all, you will NEED to call Apple to buy an OS X Install DVD (unless you have it)\n", "Q: Desktop icons rearrange spontaneously (Yosemite) I like to have all my desktop icons and shortcuts in very specific places.

When I close the lid, the fans keep going and the computer slowly becomes warmer and warmer, louder and louder. Also, when the lid is closed, the little white \"sleep light\" on the front of the computer ignites solid (does not pulsate, as it normally should do when asleep).\nThen, when I open it back up, the screen will not turn on (it remains black), the white \"sleep light\" turns off (still no pulsating) and the computer becomes completely unresponsive to any kind of keyboard, mouse or trackpad input. It simply won't respond to anything.\nWhen this happens, the only \"fix\" I've found so far is to hold down the power button until the machine turns off completely, and reboot. At which point it seems to be working fine again for a while. This doesn't happen every time I close it; only occasionally.\nIt almost seems like sleep mode has been \"inverted\" in a way. I'm not even sure if this is likely to be software or hardware related issue, but it started happening after having used OS X Mavericks for a while, and has persisted after upgrading to OS X Yosemite.\nI saw a couple of other similar questions and answers, but nothing that quite seemed to match the description above, and I haven't been able to find a solution for my problem in the other questions.

Usually I just copy the newest template to the network share and it asks if I want to Overwrite/replace. Now when I attempt that it never asks me if I want to overwrite. It just hangs. Then if I attempt to change the file on my desktop, like rename, I get the error -8076. To resolve that error I have to run killall Finder for it to release the file.\nI am however able to delete the file and then copy up the new one but when working with 40-50 new files a day that is a burden especially with large files.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Try connecting to the drive with CIFS:\\ instead of SMB:\\.

(You only reset the PRAM according to the steps you have done above.)\n\nA: Failing all of that, take it into an Apple store and have an Apple Genius look at it. Or go to a local store that does Mac repairs...\nBut basically your upgrade to Yosemite coincided (coincidentally, very unlikely that it caused it) with a hardware failure. Like Alex said possibly a graphics card failure...\nBut get your model and serial number and check out his link then bring it into an Apple store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider.\n\nA: If there is a progress bar and it shuts down, this probably means that your hard-drive has corrupted.

Install yosemite on it. Delete the other partition where now lion runs\n\nA: Yes. Creating a new partition, installing Yosemite (or whatever Mac OS you care) there and then copying/downloading the installer onto it is a great way to then erase your Primary partition.\nThen you can cleanly install OS X on to the first partition and then delete the \"staging\" partition, finally resizing the first partition to take the whole drive again.\nMy way is \"better\" since if you install on to the second partition, deleting the first might leave you with space you can't re-grow the second partition to recover the first. I've never seen a case where I can't delete follow on partitions and then grow the first to take up all space.\n\nA: If you are wanting to do a clean install. Install OS X Yosemite. Then boot to the recovery partition, go to Disk Utility. Erase the partition, and reinstall a clean copy of OS X on the erased partition.\n\nA: Create a usb drive installer and wipe the disk when booted from the installer.

In this point release discoveryd is replaced by the previously ousted mDNSResponder.\nThe originally supplied answer follows...\nThis is caused by an interaction with a daemon called discoveryd (that is present in Yosemite OS X 10.10.0 to 10.10.3) and the sleep proxies that are present within Apple TVs and Airports.\nI outlined a workaround here; which is basically disabling \"Wake for Network Access\".\n9to5Mac reports that discoveryd has been dropped in OS X 10.10.4 beta and replaced with the previously ousted mDNSResponder daemon.

Your highlighted portions will be copied into the email with your notes and formatted nicely.\n  Strangely, on the Mac the application doesn't care about whether the book is copy protected—it will always copy the highlighted portion. The iOS application indeed discriminates though. If your book is copy protected, then only the chapter name will be shared.\n  That seems to be the only way to do it unfortunately. :/\n\nUsing my laptop's trackpad, I had to hold down ctrl + shift while tapping on the trackpad in order to bring up the contextual menu while retaining the selection.\n\nA: Klib works a charm.

Now when I try to double click the .sparsebundle, it tells \"Image not recognized\".  In disk utility, this sparsebundle appears in the left, with a volume underneath it called \"Time Machine 3\".  I cannot run verify/repair on the .sparsebundle itself, but I can on the Time Machine 3 after mounting it, and it runs and says the disk is ok.  The disk pops up and I can navigate to it in Finder, but this still doesn't allow me to access my files and folders saved on it. -__-\nIt seems like all of the actual data is stored in some cryptic \"bands\" folder.\n\nA: Time Machine backups cannot be browsed in Finder. You must view them through Time Machine.\nIf you are using a computer that is different from the one where the backup was made, there are additional steps. The Time Machine - Troubleshooting page explains further.\n\nTime Machine keeps the backups for each Mac separate, and normally only shows the ones for the Mac it's running on (selected in the Time Machine Preferences window), even if there are other backups of the same or a different Mac on the same or different disk/partition.\nTo see these \"other\" backups, you need the Browse Other Backup Disks or (Browse Other Time Machine Disks on Snow Leopard or Leopard) option.  It's available by Alt/Option-clicking the Time Machine icon in your Menubar, or by control-clicking (right-clicking) the Time Machine icon in your Dock.\nYou'll see a selection screen showing all the mounted disks/partitions that have Time Machine backups on them.  Select the one you want, click Use Selected Disk, and you'll be taken to the normal \"Star Wars\" display, where you should see all the backups on that disk/partition.\nYou may not be able to restore such items normally (to their original location);  if not, you'll need to restore them to an alternate location per Frequently Asked Question #16.\n\n\nA: Double-click on the .sparsebundle file. This will mount it like an external disk: \nThen, open the Backups.backupdb folder. This reveals a lot of folders like this: \nThis is a problem, right? Well, actually, no. Because if you scroll down to the bottom, there is an alias titled \"Latest\", like this: \nOpening the alias will take you to your most recent backup. Just go through the list of folders and copy all of the files you want. \nLet me know if you have any problems with this or want some help!\n", "Q: Create a partition on SD card for ext4 filesystem I've got an SD card and want to create a partition on it for the ext4 fs.\nThe partition must start after 1MB.

In my mind it must be something like two partitions with no format. First is 1MB and the second is all left free space on the SD card.\nHow can I achieve this?\nThank you.\n\nA: OS X cannot see ext partitions. You would be better to do this on Linux.\nYou can install support e.g OS X Fuse as outlined in http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20/mount-ext-linux-file-system-mac/\nYou will also need FUSE-Ext2 as https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Ext\nI am not sure if this will allow you to create ext4 partitions, but you can certainly mount them.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro trackpad goes erratic when paper touches it Whenever I set a piece of paper or a notebook with paper over my trackpad, it begins to act erratically for hours at a time. By erratic, I mean the mouse jumps around the screen and sometimes even clicks / right-clicks. This has been happening for several years (my MBP is from 2010, late-fall 15\" i7). \nI've never bothered to take it in, because it usually goes away. It also helps if I vigorously wipe it with a dry cloth.\nDoes anyone know the cause of this? Is there some type of oil on paper that could be the culprit?\n\nA: The oils in your skin and lotion can sometimes have an effect on your trackpad. The best way to clean it is with a damp, clean, lint-free cloth. If that does not work I would try an SMC reset (http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht3964) and a PRAM reset (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222)\n", "Q: Does iTunes Match renewals use Gift Card credit? My iTunes Match account is due for renewal, and I have some money credited to my account. I would prefer to have iTunes just credit my card versus using this gift card. When I look this up online, a lot of people reference that it does charge the card, but requires you to have another payment option. \nThis is always a confusing space. For example, I know you can't gift an app to someone with GC credit. \nMy question is, if I have any credit in my account, is it going to take that first, or can I have it just use the CC?\n\nA: Yes, you can! \nAccording to http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht4914: \n\"You can use store credit to pay for your iTunes Match subscription; however, you must have a valid payment method on file at the time of sign up.\"\n", "Q: Can I reduce the time to display the list of running windows when clicking and holding the icon of a running application in the dock? When you click and hold the icon of a running application in the OS X dock you get a list of current app windows that you can pick from.  The list of windows appears after some time interval.  Is there a way to reduce this interval?\n\nA: If your Mac has a trackpad, you can click with two fingers to bring up that menu without delay. If it has a Magic Mouse, you can click on the right side of the mouse. If it has a standard PC mouse, you can right click, and whatever hardware you have, you can also hold Control while clicking to do the same thing.

A few times each day, the email logo bounces up and down and asks me to (again) input my aol password. Why is this? And what can I do to stop this happening?\n\nA: I'm not understanding why this is happening with you. Well basically, you can say your mac is \"forgetting\" your Apple ID / email or whatever. If this situation is related to an Apple ID, using The Mac App Store, logout and login and tick the \"Don't Forget\"\nYou can use Keychain Access! You can modify which applications will automatically log you into your email while starting the application.\n", "Q: How to print result of some javascript execution in ScriptEditor? I want to test a piece of a very simple javascript and print out the result.

I installed a few normal programs (DropBox, 1Password, etc.). I did not open the Mail app at all. I then upgraded to Yosemite. After a seemingly successful upgrade, when I tried to open Mail for the first time, it hung without displaying any screens (though the menu bar does display). Leaving it for several minutes has no effect. Clicking anywhere transfers focus to a new application, causing the Mail menu bar to disappear. Clicking on the Mail icon again has no effect.

I don't have Spotlight enabled.\nObviously a solution would be to disconnect/reconnect those drives, but that is something I would like to avoid.\nIs there a way to tell Mac OS X not to eagerly/preemptively fire up the drives?\n\nA: Here's what did it for me, fingers crossed:\nIn an open/save file dialog, drag your external drives from the sidebar to nirvana. Next time you open/save a file, the disks should not spin up.\nKudos to the original hint.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this question because I was experiencing this same problem recently. Ultimately, I found the the order I had set in the Finder sidebar affected the behaviour. I had moved the external volumes and drives to the top of the sidebar and that made the Save-As dialogue box hang until the external drives spun up.

While slow and unresponsive, I opened Activity Monitor. After just a few minutes the amount of virtual memory increased from 10Gb to 24GB and Safari (what I opened the PDF with) was listed as using 7.8GB of RAM. Further the graph of Memory Pressure as shown in activity monitor had moments of being orange and red before the whole system becomes totally unresponsive.\nI have tried restarting the laptop, closing other applications, and downloading and opening in preview. None of which helped. \nThis file isn't particularly large so i was wondering what would cause it to do this? The file does however contain numerous pictures and equations, which is what I believe to be the cause.Any ideas how to comfortable open this PDF?\nEdit:\nHere is the usage from Preview after opening for about 1 minute:\n\n\nA: I ran into some issues like this with a PDF which contained some embedded vector images… the images were plots generated by Mathematica which had been exported as PDF files. The images were composed of a few thousand data points. As Preview attempted to plot these (thousands of) vectors, it would lock up (just as you describe). \nExporting the images from Mathematica as a PNG (raster format) solved the problem instantly. I'm not very familiar with the behavior of PowerPoint with vector images (if I recall correctly, the two do not mix…). Could you try rasterizing some of the more complex images prior to placing them in the document? \nNote: as in your case, the PDF file didn't seem particularly large (the file size of the PDF image compared to the PNG image was very comparable), but the amount of processing power required to render the PDF brought the system to a crawl every time I scrolled to the point in the document where the complex plot was located. \n\nA: I found this online Tool that might help you.\nLoad your File and use it to find out what the problem might be.\n\n\nA: Try using evernote. I have been able to fly through bulky PDF by importing and viewing them in Evernote. It dosn't solve the problem of reducing size but gets the job done in the fastest possible way.

You will need a 12.7mm one such as: http://www.amazon.co.uk/adapter-caddy-Apple-iMac-slot-/dp/B00C0NU1TU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415181905&sr=8-1&keywords=imac+superdrive+enclosure They are around £10-£25.\nEnsure that you remove the optical drive thermal sensor and replace it back onto the SSD.\nAs far as SSD choice I have used Crucial, Samsung and OCZ. The Samsung evo series are very good speed over price.\nI would also suggest moving your mac os install to the ssd and using the normal HDD as storage, this will improve speed.\n", "Q: Fusion drive upgrade: how to get my installation back afterwards? I'm planning an upgrade of my iMac 27\". An SSD will be added and combined with the existing HDD into a Fusion Drive. I have just reinstalled everything recently and like to keep this installation. \nMy plan is to clone the HDD to an external drive using SuperDuper or something along these lines, the install and create the Fusion Drive and afterwards clone back onto the Fusion Drive.\nWill this work? Or will cloning back \"destroy\" the Fusion Drive setup?\n\nA: Personally I did the same thing. No, Cloning and restoring the clone to the fusion drive will not \"Destroy\" the fusion drive.\n", "Q: Some user's images of StackExchange are not displayed on my mac. Since this morning I noticed that some of the user images of this site are not displayed, both on safari and on chrome (all the \"fractal\" images are displayed, and alo some pictures, but others are not). Is this a problem of StackExchange or of my computer? I have OS 10.10 Yosemite, and the latest versions of safari and chrome.\n\nA: The user images (avatars) are stored on various services, such as Gravatar. It is possible one or more service is either unavailable or blocked on your network.\nIf you use a third party advert blocker within your browser, you may find some user images are blocked. Some advert blocking software considers single-source/multi-website user images a means of tracking your activity across the Internet, and thus blocks the images from loading.\n", "Q: Hide dock bar permanently Is it possible to hide dock bar permanently?

I'm looking to replace my home server with a Mac Mini. I do a lot of conversions between movie formats (ie MKV to mp4) and was curious if it made more sense to go with the 2012 server model or the brand new (2014) model. \nI would be bumping up the specs of the new model to the 3.0GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7 and 16GB ram. Likewise I would put 16 ram in the 2012 model\nI suppose my question is would I see much of difference between these models for things such a streaming playback for 1080p to my appleTV, and converting movie formats?\n\nA: The 2012 server is much more powerful than the gimped high end 2014 version and has beaten it in speed tests, too. \nYou cannot install your own RAM in the 2014 model.\nYou would see no difference in regard to playback between the two, a MacBook Air i5 could handle that task just as ably. Where you will see the difference is with conversion times and processing power, with the 2012 server coming out far ahead.\n", "Q: Yosemite - Pre-release: How do I opt out installing the beta seed? Last night Apple put forth 14B17 a Pre-release: OS X Update Seed 10.10.1\nI don't want to install it, but it doesn't go away.\nI tried downloading the 'normal' Yosemite from the App Store and reinstalled it over the old one. All is well but the Pre-release update is still there bugging me to upgrade.\nHow do I disable it? There should be a file somewhere that survives a OS X reinstall (in place upgrade) but I can't figure out where.\nLater edit... You're right. However my Change button had no text in it and it was small. I think this is a localization issue/bug. Change to English and there it was. Thanks!\n\nA: Go to System Preference -> App Store, then select Stop showing pre-release Software Update seeds in the App Store\n\n(source: tekrevue.com) \n\nA: It seems to be an App Store preference.\nhttps://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll\n\nA: Apple Store preferences options disappeared on newer releases and so far the only way to unenroll seems to be via the command line\nsudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog\n\n\nA: The post marked as the answer is not really the answer to this problem. The answer is that you need to change the OSX language to English to make the 'Change' button appear, as was suggested above in a secondary post. There's a text-formatting problem by which this button remains hidden in other languages such as Spanish. \n", "Q: Clean install of Yosemite on 2008 MacBook Air I am trying to upgrade a 2008 MacBook Air from OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) to 10.10 (Yosemite). I understand from the Apple web site that the minimum required version of OS X is 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) for an in-place upgrade. However, I am assuming —correct me if I'm wrong— that the pre-existing version requirement isn't relevant if doing a clean install from a USB boot disk or other media? In any case I have had trouble doing this, hence this post:\nI have found several guides on how to create a bootable USB stick for Yosemite, and my colleague has kindly created one for me using her newer MacBook. The guide used is located at http://www.guidingtech.com/34311/clean-install-yosemite-os-x/. I have attempted the install using the stick, by pressing the alt key after power on and selecting the USB stick but I am then faced with a No entry sign and the Air shuts itself down.\nI would like to know what the most appropriate approach would be to get Yosemite working (legally). I don't have a Snow Leopard disc, and ideally I'd like to do a clean install anyway.\n\nA: What you're encountering is not related to the pre-existing version, but likely that your MacBook Air is not supported for Yosemite at all.  Apple lists the Late 2008 model as the earliest MacBook Air which can run Yosemite.\n(Source) http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6412\n", "Q: To take off the Transparency features in Yosemite I have the newest Macbook Air with maximum flash memory and processor power. \nStill, the search functionality lacks i.e. there is a time gap when hitting a button and getting the result in Finder. \nNo such gap exists in Terminal. \nHow can you take of the new features of Transparency and others which can make my Yosemite faster?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open up System Preferences.\n\n*Click on Accessibility.\n\n*Place a checkmark next to Reduce Transparency.\n\n\nHow to Improve OS X Yosemite Performance\n", "Q: Contacts sync iCloud/iPhone/Mac after clean OS X install I have an clean Yosemite installation without any data transfer from an old mac.\nMy iCloud account is synced with my iPhone, and the mac is using the same iCloud account.\nAfter a sync some contacts are not synced.\nWhen I logging into www.icloud.com via the browser, i see all my contacts in my iCloud's address book. Here are 3 groups.\n\n\n*\n\n*mobile contacts\n\n*all contacts\n\n*wgroup\n\n\nAll 3 groups are synced with my iPhone but  didn't get synced the \"mobile contacts\" group nor the \"wgroup\" on the Mac. (The Mac didn't shows the groups).\nWant achieve the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*get synced all contacts and all groups on my all devices.\n\n\nSounds simple, but\n\n\n*\n\n*where to setup what groups should be synced on Mac\n\n*or how to move all contacts into single group?\n\n\nPs: ofcourse, i can send by email the vCards to Mac but this isn't the right solution.\nAny idea?\n\nA: I had the same issue with certain contacts and contact groups not coming back from iCloud after a clean Yosemite install. \nToday I found out that all this contact groups and contacts are starting to sync once I edited them, e.g. add a contact to a group, update a contacts phone number. For me it worked to edit them in icloud.com (webpage) or on an iOS device.\n\nA: While @Ralf solution is working, editing 300+ unsynced contacts isn't an easy job.  So, because the iCould and IOS are in sync and contains all contacts, only the Mac contacts are unsynced i solved it as following:\n\n\n*\n\n*selected all contacts in the iCould web app (click the cog at left bottom)\n\n*again via the \"cog\" clicked Export vCard... (the Safari downloaded an .vcf file with all contacts.\n\n*Again Select All and Delete - so, deleted all my contacts via the iCould, so this erased all my contacts from the iPhone too.\n\n*Cleaned up all groups, in the iCloud.\n\n*Started Contacts.app in the Mac\n\n*Deleted all groups and all remaining contacts.\n\n*and finally dropped into the Mac's Contacts.app the downloaded file and imported all previously exported contacts.\n\n\nIn this way I got all contacts in sync with iCloud, iPhone and Mac.\n\nA: same issue and quite discouraged by the idea to edit 390 contacts.\nI started the procedure suggested by m666, exporting my the contacts from iCloud.\nAs soon as the file has been created, voilà, something triggered contacts.app that asked the confirmation to import these 390 items, synching iCloud and Contacts. \nI hope this will work for others...\n\nA: I found a different approach worked for the same problem.  By going in to iCloud contacts and editing each group name ( I did this by adding three semi colons after the group name) hitting enter and then going back in and removing the semi colons and hitting enter again the groups appeared in the contacts app on my iMac......Go figure!\n", "Q: I can't install “lockfile-progs” which is necessary for “log check” by HOMEBREW on YOSEMITE I have upgraded my Mac OS X to 10.10, Yosemite, but things go wrong. For other commands, I've succeeded to re-build those programs.\nHowever logcheck, which is installed by homebrew can't work well since the lockfile-progs is a prerequisite. The error message is:\nfatal: lockfile-progs is a prerequisite for logcheck, and was not found.\n\nBut I can't find the way to install the lockfile-progs to Yosemite. Is there any advice for this situation?\n\nA: This appears to be a bug; you should report it to Homebrew.\n", "Q: How to enrol in a program as a Commercial Software House I represent a commercial software house that is about to develop an iOS app for a single client company. Our aim is to develop multiple apps for multiple clients over time.  The client needs the app to be distributed via the App Store. I've read that for the client to appear as the seller in the App Store (although it will be free), they would need to enrol in the developer program.   I foresee that we'll have to advise all our potential clients to enrol which seems illogical as they are employing us to do all the work so to avoid any 'technicalities'.\nDoes anyone have real life experience of how to manage enrolment in these cases? \n\nA: Each client will need an Apple Developer ID and membership of the Mac and/or iOS Developer Programs.\nThere are two approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can develop and submit applications for Mac or iOS. After acceptance into the App Store, transfer the app to the client's Apple Developer account.\n\n*You can develop and submit the applications using the client's Apple Developer ID credentials.\n\n\nIn both cases, the client will need to be enrolled with an Apple Developer Program.\nYou can delay this cost for the client by developing and submitting the app using your own Apple Developer Account.\nPart of the process of enrolling involves agreeing to Apple's terms of service and other legally binding agreements. Without agreeing to Apple's agreements, the receiving client will not be able to participate in Apple's App Store or Mac App Store under their own name.\nIt is possible to have applications associated with your Apple Developer ID but not participate in the App Stores. However, those applications will not be eligible for sale through Apple.\nIt is possible to associate your details as the technical contact for your client's Apple Developer IDs. This can help separate your technical role from the client's business role.\n", "Q: How to create an infrastructure Wi-Fi network from Yosemite with no Internet connection? How to create a Wi-Fi hotspot (infrastructure network, not ad-hoc) on a Mac without any Internet connection?\nIn Windows, we can easily create an infrastructure wifi LAN hotspot with:\nnetsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=MyWifi key=12345678\nnetsh wlan start hostednetwork\n\nIt is compatible with most devices like Android/Windows/Mac/iOS, and it does not require an available Internet connection.\nSo, is there a similar solution on OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) that:\n\n\n*\n\n*can create a Wi-Fi hotspot;\n\n*compatible with most devices;\n\n*does not require an Internet connection?\n\n\nA: In System Preferences, go to networking and connect your Mac to a wired network. Firewire or thunderbolt or ethernet (with or without an adapter) is needed to have a physical connection in the green or orange state. You need a link up and not necessarily a viable connection to any network.\nThen go into Sharing and enable Internet Sharing, there, share the connection of something you aren't using (say, for example, thunderbolt ethernet) then other computers can connect to it as if it was a WiFi hotspot and features that use LAN will work perfectly fine. If that LAN has a route to the internet it will work\nThis method allows OS X to act as a software router and avoids the wireless network being created in an ad-hoc mode with it's limitations.\n\nA: That function seems to be limited to only Apple devices.  Why?  I wish I could explain why Apple does what it does sometimes.  Anyway, there is a utility called \"airport\" which can be accessed from Terminal:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -h\n\n(that command will print out the help page.  Also you might want to \"pipe\" to \"more\" because it is quite lengthy)\nairport -h | more\n\nThere used to be a \"-i\" option (lowercase \"i\"; the uppercase still works) that allowed you to \"create\" networks, but that seems to be gone.  I used it a few times years ago to create ad-hoc networks years ago but found that I could keep a small Netgear or Linksys handy that would handle DHCP, security, etc. for me much easier than it was for me to configure ad-hoc networks.\n\nA: From the question: Create AirPort network from the command line?\nA program compiled from source code on https://gist.github.com/wolever/4418079 do works on 10.10, and it creates an infrastructure AP. But, it only allows a WEP password, which is not considered safe. So, I'll keep this question open for a better solution.\n", "Q: How to sync music from old PC to new PC? I have a new iPhone 6 and need to get my non-purchased music from the old iPhone 4S to the new phone.\nWhen I connect to iTunes on the new PC (with the old phone) and select Sync Music I get the warning asking me if I'm sure, and do I want to remove existing music etc. from this iPhone. And of course I don't because all the music I need is on that old iPhone. The old PC crashed and is no longer available. How can I transfer the songs to the new phone without having access to the old PC that the 4S used to sync with?\n\nA: I backup all media contents from my old iPhone 4 to iCloud, and then login the same account on the new iPhone 6, and then sync all media to the new phone, quite convenient.\n\nA: You cant because itunes relies on the physical media to be in the itunes media folder on the computer.\nDo you still physically have the old computer? A solution would be to remove the old Hard Drive from your computer (which has all the data stored on it) and purchase a usb to 3.5\" Hard drive adapter. This means you will be able to transfer your old itunes library into your new one and then successfully sync the music to your iphone.\n\nA: You can only sync your iPhone with 1 iTunes Library at a time. If your old PC has crashed and the iTunes Library is no longer accessible you will have to sync your phone with your new PC.\nSyncing your iPhone on your new computer will wipe your phone but you can always re-download any purchased music through iTunes and put it back on your phone. Any music you burned will have to be reburned and copied onto your new computer.\n\nA: You can use an application like SharePod to extract the music from your iPhone. It is available for Windows and Macs. It transfers 50 tracks for free but then needs to be registered to do more.\nI've used iFunBox in the past, which is completely free, but I just tried it there and it can't see the contents of my Music folder. I'm sure I used it successfully recently. Your mileage may vary though so you might want to try that. You may find your music under \"Raw File System\" in \"iTunes_Control/Music/\" \nThere are a selection of alternatives if you have no luck with these two.\n", "Q: MIcrosoft Outlook stopped working on Yosemite I ran Outlook for a day after updating to Yosemite, but after a reboot, it no longer works.\nWhen I click on the Outlook icon, it bounces a few times but never runs.

As long as you have the Documents & Data option checked in the\n  iCloud pane of System Preferences, iCloud copies all the documents\n  stored in your iCloud account to your Mac, so you can work with them\n  offline. If you ever need to access such files, there are several ways\n  to do so.\n\n^^^ found that on MacWorld, and I'd basically like to do the reverse of that, but as they mention in the article, it was written before the WWDC keynote, and the 'Documents & Data' option doesn't seem to be there any more.\n\nA: iCloud Drive is specifically to sync your data between machines, roughly similar to how Dropbox etc works.\nRemove a file from one machine, it's gone from the others too.\n'Documents & Data' was deprecated & is removed when you first convert your iCloud (Mavericks/iOS 7) storage to iCloud Drive.\nAlternative suggestion [untested]\nHow about - as you don't mind having one copy locally, just not two, changing your iTunes Library location to a folder inside the iCloud hierarchy?\nMove your actual 'Music' folder there & just point iTunes to it\n\n\nA: To expand on Stuart's comment to your question, I think the question you want to ask is \"can I move my iTunes media to my iCloud folder?\"\nApple has a document telling you how to move your iTunes media. Since iCloud Drive shows up as a regular folder there shouldn't be any problem with moving your media to it.\n", "Q: Git autocompletion is not working with homebrew Here is my setup:\nbrew install git bash-completion\nWarning: git-2.1.3 already installed\nWarning: bash-completion-1.3 already installed\n\nIn .bash_profile:\nif [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then\n    . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion\nfi\n\nBut I still don't have autocompletion for git commands.

I have the Kohl's app installed on my iPhone running iOS 8.1.  I notice that whenever I enable Location Access for that specific app, it starts pinging my location immediately, based on the location services icon in the status bar, and the purple location services icon next to the app in the settings.  This takes place even though the app is not running, and I have Background App Refresh turned off for that app, although it shouldn't matter as it is not even running in the background.\nIs this expected behavior?  If so, is there a way to only enable location access only when I'm running the app?\n\n\nA: The app itself must support the \"While Using the App\" option. If it doesn't, then as you have discovered, your only options are \"Always\" or \"Never\".\nPresumably you would only want to allow this app to access your Location for geofencing-type reminders (e.g., offers). If so, you have to pick \"Always\" and you are at the mercy of the app to some extent with regard to how often it gets your Location, and how it is used. iOS 8 apps, even when terminated and even with Background App Refresh off, can still have certain Location service events delivered to them by iOS :\n\n\n*\n\n*significant location change service\n\n*region monitoring service\n\n*visit service\n\n\nThe only other option is to deny Location to the app using \"Never\".\nApple's Core Location Manager reference is here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/index.html\n", "Q: Identify if a text was sent using an iPhone How can I find out if a text was sent via an iPhone instead of a Mac?

I have attached an HFS+ hard drive with Mac OS X installed to an Ubuntu machine because while booting the Mac shows a blinking folder with a question mark. I searched Google and the results say that the 3 TB HDD is damaged. When I attach the HDD it reads well in Ubuntu.\nSo my question is how can I reformat the HDD with HFS+ in Ubuntu without using Mac OS X?\n\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 and the HDD is perfectly fine - I have tested it. Just wanted to reinstall every mac osx hdd so that it can boot up.. I paid a lot for that ... \n\nA: To answer your question:\nYou can format a drive in Ubuntu with the HFS+ format by using either gparted or by installing the hfsprogs package - use sudo apt-get install hfsprogs to install the program.\nAs for the additional details in your post, it is concerning that you have determined through Google that your drive has failed.  To properly determine if your drive has failed, you need get the SMART diagnostic info from the drive itself.  If it responds back with anything but \"Verified\" then your drive has a problem.\nIt is also important to note that \"formatting\" a drive will not repair it.  You will just make those bad sectors availble for writing again which can and will lead to data loss.\nUnder OS X, you can get it by issuing the command:\ndiskutil info diskx | grep SMART\n\n(Substitute x with your disk number; most likely 0)\nHowever, that may not be enough.  There is a free utility I have used to verify my drives, it's called DriveDX and it's reporting capability is completely free.\nBefore formatting your drive, I highly suggest you take a look into these areas first.\n\nA: The question mark does not necessarily mean that the drive itself is damaged. It could also just mean that the data stored on the drive is not structured correctly. If you have edited partition tables, moved partitions or changed system files that could happen.\nThere's really no need for you to use Ubuntu to format the drive. It seems to me that you think that OS X cannot read/write your drive because of the question mark, and that's why you want to use Ubuntu. This is not the case.\nIf you can read/write the drive using Ubuntu, you can do so with OS X as well.\nI would recommend using ordinary OS X Recovery Mode to reformat and reinstall OS X. You can initiate Recovery Mode by booting the Mac holding down the Cmd and R buttons.\n\nA: If the HDD is damaged, and you try to format, you will lose all of your data and operating system (unless this is a multi-drive computer and the damaged one is not the one with the operating system, in which case it should boot up fine)\nHowever,\nIt appears that the latest GParted can create HFS+ partitions. You can look up tutorials on how to install and use GParted here, but check out this. The guide says windows, but the UI is identical. Also, to install on Ubuntu, run sudo apt-get install gparted in the terminal.\n", "Q: Numeric keys (on the right side) doesn't respond at all I have keys responding problem on a brand new iMac (Yosemite) with new numeric keypad.

Someone here asked the similiar question and several people advised to make a bootable usb-drive and restore the system from it.\nMy questions is - can I use the 5,33Gb file I downloaded from \"purchased\" to simply upgrade without the need to backup my MB Air first? Should I copy the file to a specific folder or may just use Desktop?\nThanks!\n\nA: I think the best option would be to create a bootable USB drive and install from there. But if you need to do it via a local file, I would copy the Upgrader File to the /Applications folder of the MB Air. \nYes, you should make a backup. Especially since you are jumping a couple versions of the OS. \n(In truth, I have not had a problem with any of the 30 or 40 upgrades I have done with Mac OS X in the last 4 or 5 years. But I always had a backup, unless I was planning on wiping the system clean. )\n", "Q: Do non-smartphones exist that are able to sync with any OS after Mountain Lion? Currently I have a Nokia 6300 and a Mac with Mountain Lion installed.

I have a macbook pro 13\" 5,5 late 2009 edition, I use it all the time for taking notes and research at college etc. but I also use it to record music for my band and occasionally I play games on it. I am quite a mobile person and whilst a desktop isn't out of the question I'm a student so don't really have much money. I have recently started to play more games and record more music and I'm becoming increasingly aware of my Mac's low performance when gaming and occasionally when recording so I looked online for ways to increase the performance. \nI've been considering upgrading to a SSD and changing my measly 2GB of RAM to 8GB.\nWill this upgrade actually increase the performance during games? How much?\n\nA: I always recommend an SSD as an upgrade to revitalize just about any system. You will notice a performance increase with an SSD, though it will be mostly load times (we're talking a night and day difference here). You aren't going to increase your frame rate. Sure, it's true that your system doesn't have many more years (months) left in it, but if you buy a good SSD you can move it to your next system.\n8GB of RAM isn't too expensive, so it really depends on how long you want to keep the system. Any performance boost you notice may or may not be your imagination.\nIf it were me, I'd do both because I do like to squeeze the last bit of life out of my electronics (though I would have done these upgrades a few years ago) and if it is generally working for your basic needs why get a new laptop?\n\nA: More RAM will always give you a nice little performance boost but the real power comes down to what processor you have.\n\nA: IMO it is not worth if you do the math.\nYou would come by for a short while with SSD + RAM, but soon to find out you do not have enough computing power.\nYou would need to upgrade the GPU + CPU + RAM + SSD to bring it up to snuff to last you another 3-5 years.\nSo what ever money you spend, it will not bring you up to today's standard and maybe only improve by a equivalent of a 2010 type.\nBattery - $130\nRAM - $100\nSSD - $150 - $500\nGPU- tbd up to $800\nCPU- can not do\nTotal aprox $500 to $1300 ??\nAlternative:\nYour computer is worth about $400 on the market.\nThen you need to add some $1000 to get state of the art computer refurbished by Apple.\n", "Q: I have the iphone 4s and it will not record videos My iphone 4s will not let me take pictures or videos it keeps telling me that i do not have enough space available.

The following command opens the containing folder in finder instead of the file in preview. \nopen -a /Applications/Preview.app \"smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf\"\nUpdate 1: I tried with and without the -a switch. The same thing happens in both cases: finder is opened with the last folder (/path/to/file). Preview is already associated with PDFs, so it should open automatically. \n\nA: Just use /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview /path/to/file.pdf instead of /Applications/Preview.app /path/to/file.pdf and it should work.\n\nA: 1.) Your situation is not related to the open command. Before one can pass a remote share filepath as part of an argument, the share must first be established at a mount point. Here's an illustration to show what happens--or doesn't happen--using the simplest of commands:\nls smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf\nIndeed, referencing a file in the manner you described--invoking its path via a mount request--causes that path to become a mount point. The Finder window you mentioned seeing: \n\n... finder is opened with the last folder (/path/to/file) ...\n\nrepresents the last known directory the system could use to create a mountable share. Run the command as you did, and look in /Volumes to see what I mean. It's likely not the share name you're used to seeing on that machine.\n2.) When using open as a command to launch an applications which is present in /Applications (or in ~/Applications), it's not necessary to provide its full path or its extension. Although the man pages would seem to indicate otherwise from their presentation, the command open -a Preview is equivalent to open -a /Applications/Preview.app\n3.) For that matter, if launch services associates a particular filetype with a default application--as with .pdfs and other image files with Preview, for example--it is not necessary to include the application name in the argument. The command open /path/to/my_file.pdf is equivalent to open -a Preview /path/to/my_file.pdf\n4.) I'm not all that clever when it comes to UNIX, so my following attempt at a solution will no doubt soon be improved by someone who has the skills I lack.\nI'll start with the simplest way I know to mount a remote filesystem (it doesn't require creating a /dev node as with mount or creating a mount point directory as with mount_smbfs).\nopen smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/share_name/ (quotes aren't necessary)\nThe share will be mounted in /Volumes, and you can open the file in Preview with this command:\nopen /Volumes/share_name/path_to_file/my_file.pdf\nThe two commands can be combined into a one-liner with &&:\nopen smb://myshare._smb._tcp.local/share_name/ && open /Volumes/share_name/path_to_file/my_file.pdf\nI tested all of the above [OS X 10.9.5], and unless I made a typo somewhere it should work. Good luck.\n\nA: Assuming that you have USERNAME and PASSWORD as credentials to connect to the myshare._smb._tcp.local, you can use curl in a shell to read contents of the file and pass it through a pipe to the Preview application:\n$ curl smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf | open -f -a Preview\n\nIf you have a POSIX shell (e.g. bash, zsh, ... [NOT fish]) you can use redirect process substitution output to Preview's input:\n$ open -f -a Preview < <(curl smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf)\n\nAnd If you want to use a named pipe:\n$ mkfifo /tmp/my_pipe\n$ curl smb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@myshare._smb._tcp.local/path/to/file/my_file.pdf > /tmp/my_pipe & open -f -a Preview < /tmp/my_pipe\n$ rm /tmp/my_pipe\n\n\nA: didn't you just try \"open -a Preview /path-to-your-file.pdf\"\n", "Q: Can't turn off email alerts for events in Yosemite After I've upgraded to Yosemite, I've started to receive email alerts about upcoming events from my Calendar.

And takes events info from Google Calendar.\nI have disabled all notifications for OSX Calendar. http://take.ms/ZVQus\nBut I still receive email notifications about upcoming events. Since I also receive them from Google Calendar, I get all notifications twice.\nHow to disable them?\n\nA: This is an old post but might be helpful for some. \nIt turns out, as far as I can tell, that the alert emails originating from the Mac mail app are just following the instructions you have programmed on Google Calendar, much like pop up notifications work. \nThat being said, as of now, there is no way to ignore than instruction from google calendar unless you remove all alerts from your mac (which also would turn off the pop up alerts, which may or may not be acceptable) or to disable the email alerts from the google calendar side (which will also eliminate the emailed alerts from google, which again, may or may not be acceptable)\nOr the third option is to live with the duplicates until apple decides to give us an option to ignore email alert settings from google calendar to avoid having a duplicate. \nHope that's clear and makes sense. \nI had called Apple Support and they could not resolve anything either. \n\nA: This worked for me:\nOpen Calendar on your Mac.\nIn the left column list of calendars, right click (or command-I) on the calendar in question and \"Get Info\"\nCheck the box labeled \"Ignore alerts\"\nHit \"OK\"\n\nA: I figured it out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Google Calendar on your computer in a browser.\n\n*In the top right, click the gear button, then click Settings in the drop down menu\n\n*At the top of the Settings page, click the Calendars tab.\n\n*Next to your calendar's name, click Edit notifications.\n\n*Once on this page you can remove or edit any default notifications.\nCorrect if i'm wrong but you should see a notification in your list\nthat looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Just remove that notification or change it to a different kind of notification (the only other option besides 'Email' is just a regular 'Notification) and you should be all good.\n\n\nA: My Cal app on my mac wouldn't let me actually Apply changes and make the alerts \"none.\"\nIt's a problem with the application, nothing else from what I can tell.\nMy fix was to go into the Day view and click on the event.\nThen I changed the Travel Time to something random (like 1.5 hours),\nand clicked apply.\nOnce that was applied, I made all of the alerts and travel time None again and hit Apply and it worked. Not sure what this problem is, but took me a while to figure out that I wasn't doing anything wrong.\n\nA: Press Command + , > Alerts. You will then be able to alter your alerts settings. In case this does not help, I suggest going into your Google Calendar settings and checking what type of alerts are enabled. Although it seems like Apple is having these emails sent to you, they are coming from Google. Take a look here too: http://www.solveyourtech.com/how-to-stop-email-notifications-from-google-calendar/.

I tried to update iMovie and got the following error.\n\nUpdate Unavailable with This Apple ID\nThis update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.\n\nIt is true that I have not purchased it, indeed I don't think I have ever used it. It came with my MacBook Pro when I bought it in 2011. I mainly decided to install to stop the App Store from nagging me about it.\nEDIT\nAfter a number of calls to Apple Support, and a solution which didn't work I was given a redemption code to install the new version.\n\nA: If you're running a system prior to OS X 10.9, you might consider updating it. Upgrading Apple's iApps from the 2011 versions to the 2013 versions requires either Mavericks (for version 10.0.5) or Yosemite (v10.0.6). The boilerplate message from the App Store has misled a good number of people.\nIf, on the other hand, you are using 10.9 or 10.10, first check the \"Purchases\" page of the App Store (Fourth icon across on the top of the toolbar) to see if the iApps are available for download. These versions replace--not upgrade--pre-installed iApps with bundles which tie them to a combination of your Apple ID and your computer's hardware ID.\nIf such isn't the case, contact Apple Support for Mac Apps, and explain your situation. You are entitled to an upgrade.\n\nA: I logged out of iTunes account - I then moved IMovie to the Trash and emptied trash.\nI then went to the App store and went to 'buy' iMovie at the latest version, it then asked for my itunes password.  After entering password it said it would be free as I already had iMovie previously.\n20 minutes later after a download, I opened up iMovie and hey-presto, it has been updated and ITunes is available.\n\nA: I had this issue with a new Mac I just purchased. Turns out the fix was just to go to the Profile tab in the App Store, click accept on the top, and verify your passcode. After that try updating!\n\nA: I had this issue. Only ever had one Apple ID, and was logged in with it. Turned out to be a very simple issue for me -- I don't purchase from the App Store, so I'd forgotten that they required a credit card when I set up my new Mac. That card had expired recently and I'd forgotten to update it on my Apple account.\n", "Q: Why is it not possible to change username on an Exchange account of Mail.app? I'm trying to set up an Exchange server in Mail.app. The username in the preferences is incorrect, and I can't connect to the server because of that. \nThere's no explanation in the UI, or any help section to explain. \nWhen I select the \"User Name:\" field nothing happens. The text is gray, and not editable. The same is true for \"external server\". \nHow can you edit this information? \n\n\nA: Maybe this is because you are connected to that Exchange server.\nYou could try to disconnect from it by taking that account offline (Mailbox -> Online Status -> Take \"YourAccountName\" offline) and try to edit the account then.\nIf that does not help, try to delete that account and create it again with the corrected credentials.\n\nA: With Exchange I had to add the account using the address I wanted to use (which broke Autodiscover) and then could specify the actual user account when Autodiscover failed. Ridiculous that you can't edit something once added.\n\nA: Mail.app uses the user component of your e-mail address as the Exchange username by default. To get through the configuration you can try entering an invalid e-mail address that consists of your valid username and domain, e.g. <exchange_username>@<domain>.\nYou can then fix your e-mail address manually by editing two fields in ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*CanonicalEmailAddress\n\n*EmailAddress\n\n", "Q: When upgrading to Yosemite from Mavericks are there any traps with Brew and Ports Currently running Mavericks. Got a LOT of things installed through Homebrew and a handful through Ports. Are these going to survive the upgrade? What is best practice in this situation?\n\nA: If you have a lot of stuff installed in /usr/local, the upgrade will be extremely slow. It's faster to move it away before upgrading and move it back when the upgrade is done -- see here for full details.\n\nA: For MacPorts I can say that the only problem was to re-install MacPorts from source.

This will prevent any network activity through your laptop, if for some reason the wifi or ethernet connection is lost.  \nIf you want to tether in the future, you will have to add it back by hitting the \"+\" button.  \n", "Q: Yosemite - remapping Russian layout Is there a way to remap keys in foreign layout by modifying existing layout or creating your own?\nYosemite (as well as Mavericks before that) has \"Russian-PC\" and \"Russian\" layout, both missing \"ё\" letter.

Please check if this works out for you.\nThe other possibility is to disable your apple script, restart the Mac, cloning disk0s3 to disk0s2, deleting disk0s3 after booting from disk0s2 and expanding disk0s2 to fill the whole hdd.\nEnable your apple script after finishing all steps successfully.\n", "Q: OS X Filevault Login issue I just reformatted and did a clean OS X 10.10 install on my MacBook Pro.\nWhen setting it up the first time I enabled FileVault. I then noticed I had configured my account wrong, so I created a temporary admin account (simply called Admin) and removed my initial account, and created a new account with admin access. I then logged in to the new account and removed the temporary Admin account.\nNow, when I start the computer, this happens (Dropbox video link).\nThe Admin account is nowhere to be seen. Not in Preferences -> Accounts, or using any kind of dscacheutil or dscl commands.\nWhen checking who has access to decrypting the disk there's only one account, and it's the new account I created (correct one).\nI can only log in to the temporary account I created, then after a long black screen I can log in to my correct account. Is this working as intended?\n\nA: How did you check which account can decrypt the disk?\nI suspect (WAG) what happened is that you set up your new account so that it duplicates the UID of the previous admin account, so it shows up in one place as being authorized, but is not actually authorized. You removed account IS authorized for file vault, even thought eh account no longer exists on the unix-y side of things.\nI'd try all this again, making sure to add the new accounts with new UIDs and that you add them to the FileVault list.\n", "Q: 10.10 updated and my internal camera not working I have just updated my 2013 MacBook Pro 13 inch with 10.10 Yosemite, but now I can't webcast.  \nHow do I turn the camera back on?\n\nA: Hi I had the exact same problem.

your\n  application.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wrjnv7p8zj1rh5u/MonoFramework-MDK-3.10.0.26.macos10.xamarin.x86.pkg?dl=0\nOne of the developers on the mono team worked hard to track down and\n  fix this issue. Hopefully, this should be the end of the GDI issues\n  for Xamarin.Mac users.\nThanks, -- Chris H\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. Neither the 3.10 nor the 3.8 versions of Mono would work for me. The 2.10, however, did! You can download it here: http://download.mono-project.com/archive/2.10.12/macos-10-x86/\n\nA: Just ran into this problem and tried the current version of mono, 4.0.5.1, but it didn't work, so I ran the uninstall script.\nmono 3.10.0.26 sounded promising but I wanted to download from the developers. Closest version found was 3.10.0.31, which worked!\n", "Q: Terminal: command overridden via shell script in /usr/local/bin not executed unless called directly I've created a shell script wrapping ssh to change my terminal background when connecting to a server following one of the many examples on this site and stackexchange.\n11:22 ~  $ echo $PATH\n/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/robertson/bin/android-sdk-macosx/platforms:/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/robertson/bin/android-sdk-macosx/tools:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/git/bin\n11:22 ~  $ which ssh\n/usr/local/bin/ssh\n11:22 ~  $ whereis ssh\n/usr/bin/ssh\n\nAs you can see, which ssh does correctly find the script I placed in /usr/local/bin, however whereis ssh does not, and when I run ssh user@example.com, I still get the system ssh without executing my wrapper.  I'm forced to call it directly via /usr/local/bin/ssh user@example.com to get the color change.\nAny idea what's missing here?\n\nA: Order of execution is based on PATH order - locations put first are searched first, if match is found it is executed, HOWEVER, programs mapping are cached so you need to refresh the cache before changes will take place (if you've used that app before). See http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/bash-shell-builtin-commands/ (point 3.):\n\nhash command maintains a hash table, which has the used command’s path\n  names. When you execute a command, it searches for a command in the\n  variable $PATH. But if the command is available in the hash table, it\n  picks up from there and executes it. Hash table maintains the number\n  of hits encountered for each commands used so far in that shell.\n\nand\n\nYou can delete a particular command from a hash table using -d option,\n  and -r option to reset the complete hash table.\n\nSidenote: maybe try to create alias instead of wrapper?\n", "Q: osx - cannot open images or pdfs When I try to open images or pdfs with preview, the application starts but the files never open.

Select \"get info\". Toward the bottom of the dialog you'll see \"Open with:\" and an arrow. Click on the arrow and you'll be presented with the applications that can open PDF files. Select Preview and then click on the box that says: \"Change All...\"\nWhen you select Preview it will say below it: \"Use this application to open all documents like this one.\"\n\nA: There can be a few reasons for this to happen, but the most likely cause is a disk permissions problem. \nDisk permissions are flags set for each item in the file system. They define whether an item can be read, written to, or executed. \nThe LSOpenURLsWithRole is a function that is used to associate a file with a program.\nOpen Disk Utility in your Utility folder and run repair permissions.\n", "Q: Finder window does not remember size.

Removes p.list, D_Store: sudo find / -name \".DS_Store\" -depth -exec rm {} \\; contents of folders Preference, the result is 0 the error persists . Who has this bug , is there a solution? Thank you all .\n\nA: *\n\n*Do a backup in case you mess up. (For experienced users who understand what the next steps do, this can be skipped.)\n\n*Open the Finder\n\n*Press SHIFT+CMD+G and enter ~/Library/Preferences/. This will open the Preferences folder inside your personal library.\n\n*Find the file com.apple.finder.plist and move (drag) it to your desktop.\n\n*Re-launch the Finder: Click the Apple icon in the top left corner, select  Force Quit, select Finder and kill it. You can restart, but this is quicker. \n\n*If it works okay, delete the plist from the desktop. If not, return the .plist to where you got it from, overwriting the newer one.\n\n\nThis worked for me.\nCredits \n\nA: I'm not sure I understand your question: You want Finder windows to be of a certain size even after closing them?\nTry holding the option key while dragging to resize, then immediately after that close all finder windows, and relaunch.\n", "Q: Adding suffixes to file names according to previous suffixes I have a folder containing files like\nABC - 2001\nDEF\nEFG - 2001-2002\nHIJ\nKLM - 2003\nNOP\nQRS - 2004  \nI want to add the year to all file names that currently have no year suffix. The suffix should always be the one of the last file with a year suffix: EFGcontains 2001 and the start of 2002, so HIJ needs the suffix 2002.\nHow could I do this?\n\nA: This should do it for the file names you have given. It assumes that the name part consists of uppercase letters, spaces, and dashes. And in the case of two years present, that they are separated by a dash. Also, it assumes that the first file does contain a year (otherwise it has nothing to deduct it from), and it will process every file present in the directory.\nCopy&paste to the Terminal, and if you want to check first that it will do it correctly, add an echo before the mv.\nfor FILENAME in *\ndo\n  # remove name part\n  TRIM=`echo $FILENAME | sed -E 's/[A-Z -]*//'`\n  # remove possible start year\n  TRIM=`echo $TRIM | sed -E 's/[0-9]*-//'`\n  if [ -z \"$TRIM\" ]\n  then\n    # file name didn't include year\n    mv \"$FILENAME\" \"$FILENAME - $YEAR\"\n  else\n    # file name did include year\n    YEAR=$TRIM\n  fi\ndone\n\n\nA: -- open a finder window to allow the user to select the target folder\n-- a logfile will be created on the desktop\n-- set PROCESS_RENAME to true to disable demo mode !!!!\n\nproperty PROCESS_RENAME : false\nproperty DEFAULT_SUFFIX : \"XXXX\"\nproperty DIGITS : {\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"0\"}\nproperty LOGFILE : \"~/Desktop/renaming.log\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set currentSuffix to DEFAULT_SUFFIX\n\n    -- let the user select the target folder\n    set targetFolder to (choose folder with prompt \"Select the target folder:\")\n\n    display dialog \"The following folder files will be renamed: \" & linefeed & POSIX path of targetFolder\n    my logfunc(linefeed & \"New folder renaming on folder: \" & POSIX path of targetFolder & linefeed)\n\n    -- get the target folder files\n    set folderFiles to name of every file of entire contents of targetFolder\n\n    -- iterate on each file found\n    repeat with targetFile in folderFiles\n        set fileExtension to \"\"\n        set fileBaseName to targetFile\n\n        -- extract file base name and file extension\n        -- expect file extension to be something like \".XXX\"\n        if (targetFile contains \".\") then\n            -- point found so extract base name and extension\n            set fileExtension to (characters -4 thru -1 of (targetFile as text)) as text\n            set fileBaseName to (characters 1 thru -5 of (targetFile as text)) as text\n        end if\n\n        -- extract suffix from base file or filename if no extension found\n        set newSuffix to extract_year_suffix(fileBaseName) of me\n\n        -- suffix found on the new file ?\n        if (length of newSuffix is greater than 0) then\n            set currentSuffix to newSuffix\n            set msg to (\"FileName: \" & targetFile & \" >> No name change!\")\n            my logfunc(msg)\n        else\n            set newFileName to (fileBaseName & \" - \" & currentSuffix & fileExtension)\n\n            if (PROCESS_RENAME) then\n                -- rename file via shell script\n                set sourcePath to (quoted form of (POSIX path of targetFolder & targetFile))\n                set destPath to (quoted form of (POSIX path of targetFolder & newFileName))\n\n                my rename_file(sourcePath, destPath)\n            else\n                set msg to (\"DEMO: Old Name: \" & targetFile & \" >> New Name: \" & newFileName)\n                my logfunc(msg)\n            end if\n        end if\n    end repeat\n    display dialog \"End of renaming folder: \" & linefeed & POSIX path of targetFolder\nend tell\n\nto extract_year_suffix(fileBaseName)\n    set found_suffix to \"\"\n    -- check presence of year suffix\n    if fileBaseName contains \"-\" then\n\n        -- extract the last 4 chars \n        set theLast4Chars to (characters -4 thru -1 of fileBaseName)\n        -- check all the last 4 Chars are digits\n        set allAreDigits to true\n        repeat with aChar in theLast4Chars\n            if aChar is not in DIGITS then\n                set allAreDigits to false\n                exit repeat\n            end if\n        end repeat\n\n        if allAreDigits then\n            set found_suffix to (theLast4Chars as text)\n            return found_suffix\n        end if\n    end if\n    -- no year suffix found\n    return \"\"\nend extract_year_suffix\n\non logfunc(msg)\n    do shell script \"echo '\" & msg & \"' >> \" & LOGFILE\nend logfunc\n\non rename_file(sourcePath, destPath)\n    try\n        set shellCommand to \"mv -f \" & sourcePath & \" \" & destPath\n        my logfunc(shellCommand)\n        do shell script shellCommand\n    on error line number num\n        display dialog \"rename_file: Error on line number \" & num\n    end try\nend rename_file\n\nPerhaps not the best way to do it, but i'm not an applescript expert.\n", "Q: g5 ppc osx 10.5.8 i can't change administrator password I have a problem with my G5 PPC with OS X 10.5.8.

That stops the Bundle ID from being used again. Information about this can be seen at https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev28d17ed35.\nNext:\n\n*\n\n*When on the My Apps screen, towards the top right hand corner, change All Status to Removed Apps.\n\n*If the app in question exists, click into it and go to App Information on the left hand side.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click Restore App.\n\nAccording to Apple, if the ID has already been used, it cannot be selected again, so in this scenario, the options are to either restore the app and work with that listing or create a new Bundle ID.\nHope that helps someone else.\n", "Q: How to run an automator app which launches an X11 app via shell script multiple times So I have an Applescript to launch xemacs, but I thought it would be nice to have something I could drop files onto (and have an app to choose from contextual menus in the \"open with\" submenu), so I tried making an Automator app.\nI called the app \"XEmacs Opener.app\" and it works... once.  But it will not launch new XEmacs windows (unless I just click the run button from automator itself) until the first one is closed.\nI tried running the shell script with nohup, used the '&' to put it in the background, and called exit afterwards, but this does not solve the problem:\nnohup /sw/bin/xemacs \"$@\" &\nexit\n\nHere's a screen-shot in case I didn't fully explain how it's set up:\n\nI also tried calling xemacs without any arguments too.  So how can I get this to open up multiple instances of xemacs - or is that not possible?\n\nA: I figured it out.  I just need to direct the output to /dev/null:\n/sw/bin/xemacs \"$@\" &> /dev/null &\n\nEasy peasy.  The output was getting grabbed by the shell script.  As soo as you redirect both standard out and standard error to /dev/null (i.e. oblivion), the rest of the workflow stops waiting and ends.\n\nA: I was inspired by your question to tinker a bit.  I don't have xemacs or use emacs, so I tried a text editor in terminal windows using iterm.\nYou can also use a second level of indirection in Automator I did this for joe (Joe's Own Editor).\n\nThis calls a second app  (Untitled.app) opening one file at a time allowing single quotes around the argument to joe, allowing spaces in path names for files (opened one at a time because of the first app):\n\nDropping multiple files on the application at the same time gives:\n\nThe idea could be used with OS X's emacs for those used to tty sessions, noting this script doesn't deal with white space in path names as is.\nYou could also change the argument to the editor in Untitled.app, and drop files on Untitled.app directly:\nCOMMAND=\"cd '$PWD'; joe -mouse -wordwrap $1 $2 $3 $4 $5; exit\"\n\nAnd any null arguments won't get opened. Any excess files will fall on the floor based on finder order.  You'll get all the files there are arguments for opened in the same terminal session:\n\nAnd or course there are a couple of Cocoa bases emacs apps such as Emacs For Mac OS X, which from the date appears to be likely Yosemite compatible.\n", "Q: Panic on boot, need to use single user mode (was: need to rebuild kext cache) I'm getting this at every boot on one Mac:\n\nWith some searching and asking around I've found that I can get a successful boot if I boot into single-user mode, mount / as read/write, and then do\ntouch /System/Library/Extensions\nkextcache -f -update-volume /\n\nThen press ctrl-D and booting completes.

Alternatively if you are using factory RAM (or third party and don't have original or suspected good RAM) and have more than one SIMM try removing one or more of them to determine if one or more of them has gone bad. Or Try new or known good memory. \nMore than likely though its a bad kext. I'd recommend a clean install and seeing if the problem persists.

I cant seem to find the path to get to my Windows directory. the only way I can get in the hdd is while I am in single user mode. I tried to connect as an external hdd to pc but it would not initialize the disk and when connected externally to Mac it does not even see it. In single user mode I can explore easily but I cant seem to find where the files are.\n\nA: The problem here is you are not specific about what you mean by \"My imac hdd is starting to go.\" Being specific and detailed will always get you a better answer.\nThat said I can (hopefully) infer that there is some sort of error that has messed up a computer's ability to actually read the drive. This could be something as simple as directory corruption (reparable with something like Diskwarrior, Drive Genius or Tech Tool pro) to an actual physical error with the drive mechanism or circuitry.\nThe fact that neither a PC nor a mac can read the drive indicates (at least) the former. And trying a commercial disk repair tool would be my first suggestion.\nAlso Boot Camp actually partitions the hard drive and segregates all Windows files on a partition completely separate from the Mac O/S files. So when you boot into single user mode you are booting into the Mac O/S and browsing the Mac O/S partition.\nThere may be a way to mount the Windows partition in single user mode, but I just don't know how.\nWhen you connected your iMac as an external HD (target disk mode) did your PC even see the Mac's drive? You would know by right clicking on the computer icon and selecting MANAGE. then go to disk management and look for the Windows Partition on the Mac drive that you just connected. I have never tried this and am not even sure if it will work.\n", "Q: Terminal directory delete issue I don't really know what it is called but it was an issue for me.\nSo here is what I was doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created Directory with content and have it open in finder\n\n*Open a terminal and go to the same directory.\n\n*In finder I delete the folder, it goes to the trash.\n\n*Recreated folder in finder, with the same name, different content.\n\n*Do a ls in the terminal, which prints out the old directory's content.\n\n\nIs this normal? Do I really have to cd .. on the terminal and enter the \"new\" directory? (If I cd .. I end up in Trash, not the directory's initial location)\nI guess it is a soft link directory, but shouldn't the terminal know that the directory it is currently in doesn't exist anymore and cd .. until it reaches a existing directory? (At step 3)\nIs there a reason why it should still point to the old directory?\n\nA: You're in the \"trash\" directory now because when you threw out the folder, your view of that folder in the terminal went with it.  The terminal, being completely inside the directory, doesn't even need to know it's been moved to the trash.  It's pwd doesn't even change because it has no reason to re-validate the current directory path on every interaction - and why should it?  the directory itself is still valid, it just lives in ~/.Trash now.\nDirectories (or folders) are really just references to spots on a physical disk, so moving folders around your hard drive never changes their disk location, so again, why should the Terminal update?  It doesn't care.\nIt's a \"gotcha\" that's been part of linux for 20 years and unix for a great deal longer.\n", "Q: OSX - Cancel click Plain and clear : How do you cancel a click after you press the mouse.\nSay for example I press the mouse on a close button to close an application, but then I change my mind and want to cancel the closing.

Any ideas ?\nNB : Using Mac OSX Yosemite\n\nA: I use the trackpad, and when I click in a wrong button, I continue to press the trackpad and trag to an other part of the interface.\nBut if this dosn't work with the mouse, you can press the cmd (⌘) symbol to cancel it.

I am in the middle of a lot of work and don't have time to re-install every app again such as Photoshop, Lightroom and a host of other phoography related software.\nThanks for your help.\nCharles\n\nA: No, it won't - Since at least Snow Leopard, the upgrade is just done over the top of the original install. The core of the system doesn't change much these days, it's more about adding features/apps.\nI'd recommend backing your work up anyway (even if you don't upgrade!) and if you have an urgent deadline, upgrade afterwards... base the time on the assumption you'll have to re-install, simply because installations can and do (fairly rarely) go wrong.\n", "Q: Connecting to OS X server with Windows 7 I run an OSX server in my office (Previously Mavericks now upgraded to Yosemite) and I need to allow a few Windows laptops to the server.\nI have never been fully successful at doing connect to the OSX server but I have had moments when I can see and connect.  Mostly I cannot connect at all, I don't know why that is. From Windows network, I can see the OSX server however when I attempt to Authenticate it fails.\nOne confusing thing that happens is that windows prompts me to log in again but forces my computer name as the domain. something like \\mycomputername\\name\nWhen I see this it never connects. \nI don't know if there is a trick to connect from my windows laptop or if I need ot config the server differently.\nWelcome any and all insights!!!\n\nA: You didn't mention what client or protocol/s you're using... could be you're talking about samba/cifs file sharing, and if so, there is an answer elsewhere on ask different (I'll try to find) that will fix your trouhle...\nBut I'll just throw this out there in case because I've done a lot of ARD/VNC and RDP the other way, and the issue that presents itself most (if definitely NOT a DNS issue) is that if the mac screen falls asleep, the client query for a desktop connection goes unanswered (very often), even if you check that box in the energy settings to wake for network access.\nI have a couple solutions if that is what the problem is: \nThe simplest solution is to set the screen to never sleep, or set a hot corner in the Screen Saver preferences panel, and leave your pointer in that corner when not in use. Its recommended you enable, in the Securtiy preference panel, check on the \"require password after...\" (to not leave your console completely inviting to any user).\nThe other solution I use is to ssh into the machine and \"wake it up\" with a bash script that uses osascript to simulate a key press. I believe the idea originates from a Mac Hints post from a while ago, and its posted here:\n#!/bin/bash\n# wake up the screen\n# (will simulate pressing the cursor key)\n\nosascript=\"/usr/bin/osascript\"\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 123'\n\nexit\n\nssh in, copy into file called \"wakes\" on server; leave somewhere in your $PATH, chmod +x wakes, run the command, then immediately attempt connection with the desktop sharing client.\n", "Q: Is it possible that my MBP (running Yosemite) can remote turn on my iPhone 4S's (running iOS 8.1) personal hotspot?

This works perfectly (i'm posting this via my 3G connection, right now).\ncheers for any help :)\n\nA: The feature I'm after is called: Instant Hotspot\nIt seems like an iPhone 4S cannot do this feature. From what people are saying, it's an iPhone 5 or newer. Apple also confirm this.\nSad.Panda :(\n", "Q: Messages app showing unread number after deleted message. Can remove/reset?

I wish there was a way to solve it without shutting down!\n", "Q: How can I get 256 colors on the default Terminal over SSH? Lots of similar questions, but I can't quite seem to find anything that is an exact match.\nI am using the default Terminal (in Yosemite) to SSH into a VM. The VM's terminal is set up to use TERM=xterm-256color properly, and 256 colors works locally on the VM with the same terminal settings, but the colors will not make it over the SSH connection. Does anyone have any idea what it takes to get Terminal to just treat the output as normal 256 color sequences?\nAll I want here is to figure out why 256-color escape codes are ignored in Terminal.app when they come over an SSH connection. And, of course, to get it to stop ignoring the escape sequences.\n\nPossibly excessive info:\nThe VM is running windows 7, shell is bash on cygwin, ssh server is bitvise.\nI'm looking at 3 cases -- locally on native OSX bash in Terminal.app, locally in the VM bash in MinTTY, and in the VM via SSH in Terminal.app.\ninfocmp xterm-256color produces identical results in all three cases, and tput colors reports 256 in all cases.\n(tput setaf 200 && echo pink) > pink produces the identical results in all three cases:\n$ hexdump -C pink\n00000000  1b 5b 33 38 3b 35 3b 32  30 30 6d 70 69 6e 6b 0a  |.[38;5;200mpink.|\n00000010\n\ncat pink either in Terminal.app (locally, not SSHed out anywhere) or in MinTTY on the VM prints out the expected pink text. cat pink in Terminal.app while SSHed out to the VM produces default light gray text.\nThe SSH connection is configured with EscapeChar none, so data should come though binary clean (changing this setting made no difference).\nThe preferences in Terminal.app are set to report as xterm-256color, though I don't think that should make any difference.\nAny ideas on what is eating the escape sequence to fail? I'm not using anything other than plain ol bash for shells, no screen or tmux (unless Terminal.app uses it automatically/internally).\n\nA: Bah... the party at fault was the SSH server. Don't know why and could not find a place to disable the behavior (except for going full dumb terminal which had its own issues), but plain old openssh gets the job done.\n\nA: Terminal only defaqltly supports 16 colors. I would recommend using a different terminal client, like iTerm2.\nAnother way to to use this program to make terminal show all colors.\n\n[In iTerm 2] The recommended way is to set your terminal type to xterm-256color in Preferences->Profiles->Terminal->Report Terminal Type. You may also need to put set background=light or set background=dark in your .vimrc. Another technique is described by Kevin Coylar in this blog post on Pretty Vim Color Schemes in iTerm2.\n\n", "Q: No AirPlay on 6 Plus My new iPhone 6 Plus (iOS 8) doesn't show an option for AirPlay in the control centre, and on the few occasions that it does, it only shows itself as a target....

I'm thinking the best way to do this is through Automator since it seems there isn't a way to access Preview through CLI.\nI'm thinking it would look something like this in the end:\nautomator -i input=input.pdf output=output.pdf PDF.workflow\n\nBut I'm probably completely off.\nHere's the basic workflow, which doesn't work as hoped:\n\n\nA: MacOS (OSX) used to have a Terminal command quartzfilter, which would apply a Quartz Filter to PDFs and allow output names. Sadly, it was removed in Snow Leopard. \nHere's a python script which works as a replacement.\nThe Automator action \"Apply Quartz Filter to PDF Documents\" applies the filter to the input, so your workflow copies the PDFs but then over-writes the originals with the Filter.\n", "Q: 30\" monitor has black border around desktop I have been using a 24\" monitor with my macbook pro early 2011 connected via a mini display port to DVI adaptor.  I recently received an HP Z30i 30\" monitor.  When I connect to it with an mini display port to display port adaptor, although it displays at the monitors native 2560x1600 resolution, the mac is scaling the desktop display down so as to leave a 1cm or so black border around the desktop.  The mac reports using a resolution of 2560x1600 and the display reports this also.   This makes the display blurry as single pixels become sub pixels.   The display looks like the same effect as having \"under scan\" turned on when using an HDMI cable at 1080p.\nI thought that maybe there was a hardware or display problem, but when I boot off a previous system partition from a different hard-drive using the same OS (10.8.5) release, the monitor set up works perfectly.  This proves the OS release, display and the hardware, so I'm thinking that there must be a preferences problem with my current setup.  Perhaps the under scan setting is somehow being applied to this display when it's not using HDMI?\nI've tried deleting /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist, ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.HostNumber.plist and rebooting but no results. \nThe scaling is applied before the login screen and logging in as a different user has the same problem.\nAny ideas?  It's driving me nuts, I've got this nice 30\" screen and I can't use it!\n\nA: I ended up \"fixing\" it by re-installing OS X on the system disk.  Brute force due to lack of success with other methods, but all good now. \nIn some cases a faulty cable can do this as well:\nExternal monitor randomly lowers resolution adds black borders\n", "Q: Sound doesn't work anymore with Yosemite Today, suddenly, my MacBook Pro is gone mute.

I'm trying to merge two different iTunes libraries.  The bigger one (on an external HD) is the default library, so I am trying to open the smaller one (on the internal HD) to export it.  However, as the first step of this I need to option+click and hold down option while iTunes is loading.  It then prompts me to enter the location of the library to open, and I select the location of the smaller directory.  However as soon as iTunes comes up it appears no different than when the default, larger library is loaded.  When I go to preferences it still says the location is the location of the larger library!\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nUpdate: I tried renaming the external library so iTunes couldn't find it, but it still showed up! When I tried exporting to see what would happen, I got a mixture of both internal and external paths in the resulting XML file.  I tried doing the same thing when not trying to open a different library and got the same result.  So it looks like somehow iTunes has files in both places, but I need to move everything into a single location (internally), so how can I do this?\nTo clarify, I have two iTunes folders, one on an external HD and one on the internal HD, and it appears that when I open iTunes it knows about both folders.  I only want one folder (on the internal drive) so that, for instance, if I disconnect the external HD things don't get confused or messed up.\n\nA: Turns out that somehow the internal iTunes got imported into the external one without changing the location of the files.  So I went to:\nFile > Library > Organize Library > Consolidate Files\n\nwhich caused it to move the files into the external drive library.\n", "Q: Photos not deleting off iPad when deleted from iPhone When I take a pic on my iPhone it syncs to my iPad as well, but when I delete a pic from my iPhone, it doesn't get deleted off my iPad. \niOS 8.1, \niPhone 5c,\niPad Air\nThe following settings are enabled:\nSettings > iCloud > Photos > My Photo Stream and Photo sharing \nSettings > Photos and Camera > My Photo Stream and Photo sharing on the iPhone\nSettings > Photos and Camera > My Photo Stream and Photo sharing on the iPad\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix the issue?\n\nA: My opinion that you had better make format to your ipod.I don't know exactly whether will be ok or not.you do as well.\n", "Q: Backing up when logged into wrong iTunes account I have just backed up my iphone on my laptop for the first time in a while and updated my handset. After I finished, I then realised that I was logged into my friends iTunes account on my laptop. \nDoes this mean that my friend will have access to everything that is on my iphone when they log into their iTunes? texts / contacts / emails etc? \nI am worried that all of my information including text messages has now been uploaded to their handset and I don't want this to happen.\nI want to make sure that when they back up their phone, they won't be uploading my information from their home computer to their phone.\nCan someone please tell me that the back up is just on my lap top and not on their overall iTunes???\n\nA: iCloud and iTunes backups are totally separate. If you backed up to your computer, it doesn't matter whose account was logged in on iTunes. The backup is on your laptop.\niCloud backups occur directly from the device and who is logged into the device does matter in that case.\nAlso I think you are misunderstanding what happens during a backup. Nothing is transferred to the phone. What you are describing would be a restore.\n", "Q: Mac Mini startup sound always plays on internal speaker My 2012 Mac Mini (Mavericks) is plugged into a USB audio interface which is selected as my sound in and sound out device. All works great, except for the startup sound which still comes out of the internal speaker. Is there a fix for this?\n\nA: Seemingly this is a feature and you can't change it. Other Mac have the same problem. You juste can mute the sound of the internal speaker during the boot.\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/770364/why-does-my-macbook-play-the-startup-sound-through-the-speakers-rather-than-thro\n\nA: When the computer is first powered on and before the OS has started, it plays a system sound (a \"bong\") to let you know the computer is starting.\nThe problem is that at that point, the computer has no access to your USB audio device, since it would require that the OS be loaded with a device driver for that device, in order to use it to play a sound.\nI believe that if you plug headphones or speakers into the Mac Mini's headphones socket then you will hear the bong through the headphones/speakers, but any audio device that requires a driver in order to work (including all USB audio devices), will not be able to play the bong.\n", "Q: Standard Windows Keyboard - wrong keys recognised I have a classic British Windows keyboard plugged into my Mac Mini.

I'm having trouble renewing my Developer Program Account which expired a month ago.\nI have emailed Apple about this issue a few times but their help was, at best, unclear.\nI log into the Member Center, click on the Your Account tab, and under Account Summary (on the left) I have 3 sections: Apple ID Summary, Contact Preferences, and Memberships.\nThe Memberships section tells me (currently) that my Developer Program Status Enrollment was Withdrawn, with a button to \"Join Today\".\nPreviously this section told me that my Developer Program Status had expired, and the button invited me to rejoin. I clicked on the button and went through the process, filling in all the same information that I had previously put in over a year ago. I eventually arrived at the part where my application was under review.\nA day later I get an email saying I cannot enroll in the Developer Program because there is already a Developer Program Account out there with my details. I responded back telling them that I am simply trying to renew my Developer Program (not start a whole new Account), and they tell me that I can renew my Developer Program in the Member Center.\nNow I've gone through the Member Center again and again and for the life of me, I cannot see anything that relates to renewing my Developer Program other than the section that tells me my enrollment has been withdrawn.\nCan anybody help? All I want to do is renew my account.\n\nA: I have run into a similar issue like this before when I was taking my ACMT certification. Essentially I created an iCloud email account and tried to use it to take my 10.9 Apple Certified Associate certifications fine but when I went to take my ACMT and log into GCX it told me I could not with that Apple ID.\nAfter calling Apple and being on the phone with a few different people for a few hours they came to the conclusion that I needed to create a new Apple ID in order to take my ACMT. Luckily I was able to transfer my certifications over to my new Tech ID just fine.\nSometimes an Apple ID can get messed up in there system and there is nothing Apple can do about it. I would create a new Apple ID and renew your developer account with it.\n\nA: Go to your developer account, but in an incognito mode browser and the renew membership banner will appear to allow you to renew.\nI had the same issue and that's what fixed it for me. \n", "Q: What sense it has to set copyright info when creating app in iTunes Connect?

Next year I have to update it?\nIn which case I can use copyright info? If somebody steels the my computer, my binary, than I can sue him? Can copyright info use against me?\n\nA: Apple does not assume who owns the copyright. The copyright field is provided for you to explicitly state who claims copyright for the uploaded product.\nApple's iTunes Connect documentation states:\n\nCopyright (required) The name of the person or entity that owns the exclusive rights to the app, preceded by the year the rights were obtained (for example, 2014 Example, Inc.). The copyright symbol is added automatically.\n\nCopyright is a large and complex issue.

The smaller one was thought to be a Bootcamp partition one day, but to date it was just another unused partition. When I needed more space, I decided to merge these two partitions. The partition was created with Mavericks, the merge was done with Yosemite.\nI opened Disk Utility and the \"minus\" button. Disk Utility told me both partitions would be merged then. However it miserably failed.

It doesn't explain why I can't create a new partition to me.\nWhat are my options to make my hard disk available in a single partition with size 750 GB? \n\nA: After gaining some experience with CoreStorage volumes, I reworked my first answer to generalize and facilitate it by adding some scenarios and deleting some dispensable steps. \nBasically there is one undocumented command to resize or expand a CoreStorage volume group and an inherent logical volume:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size  \n\nThe command expands or shrinks the whole CoreStorage Volume Group including the physical volume(s), the logical volume family and the logical volume in one step to the desired size.\nWhile shrinking it down to the size of the occupied space in the logical volume shouldn't be problem at all (but not recommended because at least 10% free space should be left), any blocking partition except the recovery partition has to be deleted or diminished before expanding the CoreStorage stack.\nThe command comes in handy in several scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*expanding a CoreStorage volume after deleting a 2nd old-style JHFS+ volume on the same device (this may happen after splitting your disk in two partitions in Mavericks and then updating to Yosemite. The first partition - your system volume - might be converted to a CoreStorage volume, while the 2nd volume is left alone.)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*expanding a CoreStorage volume after manually deleting a Boot Camp NTFS volume\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*resizing a CoreStorage volume to create 2nd old-style JHFS+ volume on the same device\n\n\n\nBeware: The command is vastly undocumented and as such potentially destructive.\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable.

I created 150GB-Macintosh-HD partition on this disk using Disk Utility, leaving 350GB as a \"free space\". When I tried to format the free space into second partition I failed to do it: when I pressed Apply it ignored my command and behaved like I never pressed \"Apply\" (when I wanted to close the Disk Utility window it warned me that there are unapplied changes).\n\n*I took the first volume (that is formatted volume named Macintosh HD, it had 150GB size) and asked Disk Utility to partition it into two partitions: 100GB + 50GB. Pressed \"Apply\" and magically Disk Utility created for me two partitions: 100GB + 400GB. At this point all space on disk become useful and I was quite happy with it.\n\n*Then I simply removed second partition, pressing \"-\" and \"Apply\". As result it was merged with Macintosh HD and I returned back to were I was before step 1.\n\n*Finally, I divided it into two partitions with the sizes 150GB and 350GB as I wanted at the start. Now the problem seems to be solved.\n\nA: I tried everything from apple.stackexchange and other blogs but none worked.\nBut this method worked like charm:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a bootable Windows USB using bootcamp.\n\n*Do not partition or download support files.\n\n*Restart your comp holding \"option\" key.\n\n*Open Windows partition and keep clicking next until you have to choose to format a disk.\n\n*Choose the block with the \"freespace\" memory i.e. unallocated space.\n\n*Click on \"new\" in the installation window and the click on \"format\"\n\n*You will get an error that is completely fine.\n\n*Quit the installation and restart to Mac.\n\n*Now that \"freespace\" is \"windows NTFS\" format.\n\n*Click on \"-\" symbol and voila. It's restored back to your Full HDD.\n\n\nA: Great article!  Thanks so much for the effort you've put into this - really helped me out!\nI was tracking the use case of expanding my Core Storage removing a bootcamp volume and merging it.\nI found I had to unlock my core storage before I could proceed with the command\ndiskutil cs resizeStack \n\nPretty simple\ndiskutil cs unlockVolume <volume ID>\n\nwhere  is the same ID for your core storage in the format of 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555\nAlso on OS X 10.11.1 I found that 0g was not a valid parameter for the resize value.  I was required to provide a specific size.\nAnd finally, I strongly suggest you also verify and repair any errors on your core storage volume before you attempt a resize.  It's easier to address those outside of the resize process.\n\nA: I had this problem, and I think the simplest fix is this: Click the \"+\" sign on the bottom of the Partition Layout, resize the second partition to what you want, and then select the format to be \"Free Space\". \nYou will see that the second partition in the layout is replaced by empty space. Then, just select \"Apply\".\n\nA: I was looking for a solution to non-destructively shrink a volume in Sierra to make room for a beta install of High Sierra, and found this page very helpful.\nI was using an encrypted volume HFS+ Journaled in MacOS Sierra.\nMatt's advice above is very good, but I found an even quicker mechanism for this, for CoreStorage Volumes that are encrypted or not.\nStart with: \nBoot into the Recovery Disk on startup of machine with CMD-R\nOnce in recovery mode, if you have a CoreStorage Encrypted volume, open the terminal window and prepare the drive like so. Otherwise skip ahead to DiskUtility usage below.\ndiskutil cs list\n\nTake note of the last UUID for the Locked Volume if it exists, then.\ndiskutil cs unlockVolume UUID\n\nThe above command should ask for the passcode which is your normal user password.\nIf you DO NOT HAVE an encrypted CoreStorage Volume you can start here:\nOpen Disk Utility from terminal or back at the menu, and use the Partition feature on the main disk container.\nYou should be able to use the '+' key to optionally add a partition to the available space, adjust the size to your preference, and then use 'Apply' to initiate a NON-DESTRUCTIVE, NON-ERASING shrink of your existing partition. This leaves you with your original data on the smaller partition and an empty partition in the remaining space. Just be sure to set the new partition to not overlap the indicated crosshatched data.\nIt will tell you that the operation does not erase existing data, and I can assure you that in my case it did not.\nThe usual caveats apply here anyway, you really should always backup if you can, before starting an operation of this sort.\n\nA: It turns out diskutil will spit out some helpful text if requested:\n-bash-3.2# diskutil cs resizeStack\nUsage:  diskutil coreStorage resizeStack\n        lvUUID|MountPoint|DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode [pvUUID] size\n        [part1Format part1Name part1Size part2Format part2Name part2Size\n         part3Format part3Name part3Size ...]\nResize both a logical volume and one of its underlying physical volumes in a\nsingle operation. A single physical volume is always chosen for the underlying\nshrink or grow, even if the logical volume's logical volume group is backed by\nmore than one physical volume. If you do not specify a particular physical\nvolume, then one is chosen for you. Note that if this is a grow operation,\nthis verb is limited by the physical volume's partition's room to grow.\nSpecifying zero as the size asks for an \"automatic\" grow-to-fill operation.\nIf this is a shrink operation, you can optionally request that new partitions\nbe created in the newly-formed free space gap in the partition map.\nAgain, note that this only resizes one of the underlying physical volumes; if\nyou need more sophistication in managing your topology, you should use the\nseparate physical and logical volume resize verbs.\nExample: diskutil coreStorage resizeStack\n         11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555 10g JHFS+ New 1g\n\n", "Q: Yosemite Server: Spotlight from client I just bought a Mac mini to use as our office server (Yosemite).\nHow can I search the shared folders with Spotlight from my client iMac?\nI tried to connect via SMB and AFP (Go > Connect to Server > afp://192.168.178.44).

I work on an iOS app for a company that sells educational courses, to access the app you need an account and paid subscription on the website.\nApple have recently rejected our application (out of the blue) quoting section 11.13 of the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, we found that your app provides access to account registration.\nAs this also provides the user access to mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app, this is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.\n\nWhile I understand the premise of this rule, I don't understand how many high profile apps with a subscription model that doesn't rely on IAP (i.e. Spotify, Rdio, Netflix) are allowed to exist in the App Store.\n\nA: Besides a simple \"It's Apple's App Store and they'll do as they want to\"...\nNetflix does not provide any registration mechanism within the app. When you download the app, the first thing you get is a login screen (and a Forgot Password link). Nothing else is present.\nSpotify has a registration mechanism in the app, but it also allows you to purchase subscriptions within the app. Rdio uses the same method. (As an aside, Rdio charges more for the in-app subscription than it does if you use their website to subscribe, to account for the 30% cut that Apple takes. This is allowed.)\nBasically the answer is, you can provide a registration mechanism in the app, but you must also set up IAP for your paid subscription. Otherwise, you can provide a login screen for your customers who have subscribed outside of the app, but no links to your registration or subscription websites.\nLook at the Review Guidelines section 11.14 (emphasis mine):\n\nApps can read or play approved content (specifically magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video and cloud storage) that is subscribed to or purchased outside of the App, as long as there is no button or external link in the App to purchase the approved content.

However, I am having an issue with this video today. When I try to download it through Image Capture it says:\n\nAn error occured while importing. The item ‘IMG_1226.MOV” was not\n  imported.\n\nWhen I do it with iPhoto it says:\n\niPhoto cannot import your photos because there was a problem\n  downloading an image.\n\nI was don't know what's wrong with the video because I can perfectly watch it on my iPhone, so I am not sure whats wrong with this.\nTo try to repair this the only thing I really tried was to update my iPhone's OS and hope it does the trick. I am using iOS 8.1 which is the newest and it did nothing.\nI am not sure how else to transfer it somewhere else so that I can have a copy of it on some other device. How does the community suggest I solve this?\nSome ideas I've had (but have not tried yet because I am not sure how to do them):\n\n\n*\n\n*Send it to Dropbox somehow by internet... might be possible? Remember, its stuck on my iphone for the time being, so I need to send it through my phone.\n\n*Make it an mp4 or some video format as is smaller (in my phone), compress it and send it  to myself somehow, by mail or Dropbox (or see if the compressed video can be sent directly, remember, I can't do it on a computer for the time being, its stuck on my phone).\n\n*upload the WHOLE thing to youtube on my phone (though I can't right now cuz it gigantic so my iphone only lets me do it by parts...). but then i would have the problem that I can't download it back... right?\n\n*Go to the Genius Bar at an Apple Store...? But what could they do that I can't though...?\n\n*one potential solution I thought was \"editing\" the video on my phone with some app that saves it a copy of it and then downloading it. I just don't know what good apps to edit videos exist for iPhone. The only issue with this is that, saving a copy that is as big will be a problem because I am already running out of space on my phone and I don't want to delete the videos until they are saved somewhere!\n\n\n\nSome further restrictions I have.\nMy phone has 32 Gigs and 24 Gigs are already used. 15.4 GB of them are because of the videos. The rest is information I am willing to erase if I can save those videos.\n\nA: Try a peer-to-peer file transfer service to move the video directly from your phone to computer, like BitTorrent Sync. This would be faster then using a cloud solution like uploading to Dropbox or YouTube and then downloading it again. It's very simple to use too, just download the BitTorrent Sync app on your phone and Mac, turn on the Camera Roll backup feature from you phone, and then send the link to your Mac to begin the transfer. This is the probably the fastest way to transfer files with out a wired connection.\n\nA: You might want to try iExplorer. Because it can directly access your iPhone as a disk device, iExplorer may be able to move the movie file to your Mac without any of the problems associated with other apps.\niExplorer can also open and read iTunes backups, which may be another way to extract the movie. My wife inadvertently wiped her iPhone a few months ago, but I was able to recover all her photos, which included a few movie files, from an iTunes backup.\nA free version or iExplorer is available, but if it works for you, purchasing the app is a great idea. I'm not sure what restrictions are on the free version, though.\nTransparency: I'm just a very satisfied user of iExplorer, and will obtain no financial gain should you purchase a copy.\n\nA: You should try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have it, do try with iMovie. (Menu “File” -> “Import Media…”)\n\n*Try AirDrop. You have to be on iOS 8 and Mac OS X Yosemite for AirDrop to work between an iPhone and a Mac though.\n\n*If you can successfully make a backup of your iPhone using iTunes, I can walk you through the retrieving of the video from the iTunes backup.\n\n*If you can upload the video to YouTube, there are ways to download videos from YouTube. It’s way easier than you might think actually.\n\n\nDon’t hesitate to comment for questions and precisions.\nBy all means, if you can get the reason why the transfer fails with Image Capture, please tell us, it will probably help (see my comment on your question).\n\nA: I use Photo Transfer app http://www.phototransferapp.com to transfer photos and videos between my iDevices and my Mac, though I admit I haven't tried to transfer as large a file as you need to do. It supports lots of formats and preserves the metadata, too. It uses WiFi or Bluetooth.\n", "Q: What Is The Path Where Apache Is Located? When I check logs (Apache, Ruby on Rails) it appears that my development Mac Mini Server is being scanned.  I would like to install mod_security.  I'm currently running the latest version of Mavericks but plan to install Yosemite within couple of days.  I use Apache 2.2.26.\nWhere are the Apache modules located on the Mac Mini Server in Mavericks and Yosemite?\nIf there is a better way to protect my service, such as turning on the Firewall in System Preferences, I'm open to that.  I just don't know enough about how to set that up where I can do what I normally do and add my websites to it.\n\nA: The default location is:\n/usr/libexec/apache2/\n\n", "Q: How to keep mute button available during call I use my iPhone for conference calls regularly, with a Bluetooth headset/microphone. Often I keep my mic muted except for when I speak.\nIt is awkward that when I want to speak, I need to wake-up and unlock my phone, before pressing the mute button.\nIs there a way to make my phone stay awake during calls, without changing the sleep/lock settings generally?\n\nA: In iOS10 you can just tap the number + call duration in the lock screen and it'll bring up the phone controls.\n\nA: Swipe right at the unlock screen during an active call and the controls are displayed. There's no need to unlock the phone to access the mute.\n\nA: I've found a really easy way. If your phone is locked, simply click the phone number/contact name and it quick links you to the screen with the mute button on. \nLike another poster, I've found when you unlock the phone normally, it links you to the last app, and then you've got to app switch to go to the phone and then mute, so it's unlock->app->switch->mute. \nThe method above is click->mute. \nIt's not perfect, but it's meant I don't have to have an uncomfortable 5 second pause when someone wants to speak to me and I've muted my sound. \n\nA: To keep it awake: try blocking the ambient light sensor with your hand or an object, so iPhone thinks you're holding it against your face. Then remove the obstruction to awaken the phone. \nThis incurs a delay to awaken but might be worth a try.\nPersonally I solved this by simply getting a Jawbone earpiece. They feature excellent built-in noise cancellation technology, so when I'm not speaking, even with the AC on full blast in my car, there's just a flatline of silence when I'm not speaking.\n\nA: Swipe right on lock screen works as mentioned in above post. If you unlock the screen with your fingerprint already you will see a green bar of the phone talk on top - swipe right on the top green bar also bring up the button to mute / unmute.\n", "Q: Having small video files from iphone videos, either compressing large ones or recording them so they are small in the first place tl;dr I want to compress very big video files and start recording them small in the first place.\nMy goal is to have my video files be small enough that they don't take up all the space in my Mac (and thus can be upload to youtube at some point). Currently they are around 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes long. I record them with the built in iphone video recorder and they are around 5 to 10 GB of size. \nI don't need them to be extremely high quality. In the way youtube has quality, I would be fine with something around 480p. Depending on the size of the video 720p is also good, but if the video is to large its not useful for me.\nI am not sure if its because the iphone just automatically records in HD, but I would like to turn that off and have videos of size less than 5GB. One way to solve my problem could be to start recording them with no HD. Is it possible to turn down the HD quality from the automatic recording in iphone? Maybe there is an iphone app that already does this? Its crucial that I am able to save them to my actual computer, so whether the app is free or not, I need to upload them to youtube and save them on my mac.\nAnother route to have small videos from iphone recording could be to compress these videos after I record them. Since, I already have a large collection of extremely large videos of size 5GB to 10GB, compressing them such that I can still watch and listen to their audio is crucial for me. Is there some kind of software for MAC that does this? Free software is always desirable, but I care that they remain watachble, a software compressing software that costs money is also option that I would want to consider.\nAre there other ways to achieving these goals:\n1) Recording videos and having them be small in the first place? (the length of the videos are going to be around 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. I am willing to compromise on quality but not size, 30 videos of each 1 minutes size is not a solution to my problem).\n2) Compressing the video files that I already have on my MAC book pro?\n\nTo get a better sense of what my goal is, I would like to have videos of the quality of the following:\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi12/technical-sessions/presentation/corbett\nThe video looks fine and if you download it its of around 123.8 MB and its 30 minutes long. Something of comparable quality (seems like 480 to me) and that size would be perfect. My videos are presentations and stuff like that, their intellectual content is more important than viewing them HD, so something comparable to that quality and size is my goal.\n\nA: Apple makes a pro app for Mac, Compressor, that can handle this task, but might be overkill. It can handle batch jobs etc.\nThere is also Roxio Toast which is a DVD burning utility but has a nice suite of tools for video conversion. You could use this to make DVDs or Blu Rays of all those vids and then get them off your system entirely. A Blu Ray burner is around $100-200 these days. \nI use Panasonic 50-year-archival BD-R media, which was about $100 for 25 discs that hold 25 GB each whenI bought it last year. I burn all my HD videos to those, then delete it off my computer entirely. Then to watch it just throw that disc into your Sony PS4 or XBOX One, or Blu Ray Player attached to your TV.\nIdeally you could do both: archive the big HD files to BD-R for backup purposes and posterity, and keep highly compressed files on the Mac for the occasional viewing.\n", "Q: Can my MacBook 1,1 be upgraded to anything higher than Snow Leopard? and can the machine be updated in its specs?

Just saw an article about the vicious malware that is Wirelurker. In short, Wirelurker can attack even non-jailbroken iOS devices, and has great potential to turn these wonderful iOS devices into dumb bots:\n\nOnce WireLurker is on your iPhone or iPad, it appears to do a number of weird and wonderful things. If you’re not jailbroken, WireLurker simply installs/side-loads more apps from the iTunes App Store. If you’re jailbroken, it does a lot more, including infecting/trojanizing existing apps on your iOS device and backing them up to your Mac. In both cases, WireLurker constantly pings a central command server, which can trigger a payload update, or instruct WireLurker to harvest and transmit sensitive details from your device.\n\nWhat can be done to safeguard against this heinous software?\n\nA: Do not download third-party apps from untrusted sources.  \nIn System Preferences, Set:\nSecurity & Privacy --> General --> Allow apps downloaded from: to either\nMac App Store or Mac App Store and identified developers\nSo far it seems this is only transferable from a computer to device over a usb to iTunes connection, which means the computer must be infected with one of these third party apps.  Also seems pretty limited to China and its third party app store for now.\nDigital Trends Article.\nPaloAlto Networks Article\n\nA: \nPalo Alto Networks said the bug, known as WireLurker, spreads through apps uploaded to jailbroken Apple devices from a third-party store, but is also a serious threat to Apple devicesthat have not been tampered with. WireLurker can be transferred from a Mac computer to a mobile device through a USB cable.\n“Characteristics of this malware family, including its ability to infect even non-jailbroken iOS through trojanized and repackaged OS X applications suggest that it marks a new era in malware across Apple’s desktop and mobile platforms,” Claud Xiao, of Palo Alto’s Unit 42 threat intelligence team who uncovered the malware. WireLurker was first noticed in June this year when a developer from Chinese firm Tencent observed there were suspicious files and processes occurring in his iPhone and Mac computer.\nThe Palo Alto report said that once WireLurker gets into a Mac computer, the malware contacts a command-and-control server to check if its code needs to be updated. The malware waits until an iPhone, iPad or iPod is connected to the Mac computer. When an iOS connects to the computer, WireLurker checks if the mobile device is jailbroken.\nIf the iOS device is jailbroken, WireLurker backs up the device’s apps to the Mac and then repackages the apps with malware. After that the infected apps are returned to the iOS device.\n\nBasically, don't install application from untrusted sites.\nSource: WireLurker bug a new threat to iOS, OS X machines\n", "Q: I can't 2 finger scroll using trackpad in Word since I upgraded to Yosemite I can't scroll using trackpad in Word since I upgraded to Yosemite.

Mine is a little different.\nI could use some of the solutions other question provide to rotate my video, however, my  original video was on the right orientation to start with!\nWhen I compress it with handBrake, it rotates it to the wrong orientation automatically. Why is it doing that? I have a lot of videos, Its so annoying that I have to rotate them back after compressing them. Can I just compress them one with handbrake not have to deal with rotating them back?\nHere is a picture of how my handBrake setting are set:\n\nOne thing that kind of \"fixes\" this is that in quickTime, there is an option to edit the video and it can rotate it but it takes 21 minutes to rotate the newly compressed video! Jesus! The video is not even 1 GB in its compressed form... isn't there a different way of doing this? This actually doesn't work because when I re-saved my video, it increased size dramatically. Its original size was under 1GB and rotating it in quicktime and then saving it increased the size to 5GB. This is ridiculous. \n\nA: Why:\nSome programs like quick time, automatic rotate the video when they display, but the original file is still not ok. Please try to see your videos using vlc or other apps. handBrake only rotate your videos if you set that option.\nHow:\nYou can rotate the video if you fill the Additional options in the bottom.

Videos are always recorded in landscape, but the orientation of the phone during recording is saved in the movie, so iPhone and probably Apple software rotates the videos during playback, while they are rotated when playing them using any other software. Video converters usually has option to rotate movie and save them so they will played correctly using any player.\n\nHandBrake (or at least the GUI) does not offer a way to rotate video. The HandBrake CLI does have a \"rotate\" option, however I found it is not a true rotation. Rather, it simply flips on an axis. The documentation is poor, but I found that a value of 1 flips on X, 2 flips on Y, and 3 flips on X and Y. So using a value of 3 is the same as doing a 180° rotation, which is useful for videos that are upside down, but not for videos that are sideways.\n\nMaybe this post will help you fix this. \n", "Q: Notes deleted after updating to Yosemite My notes have been deleted after updating the OS on my Macbook Pro from Lion to Yosemite.

Old versions can still be downloaded for free, but they use an old version of ffmpeg that doesn't even support Hi10P, and the application has changed a lot since then.\nBoth Movist and MPlayerX have nicer UIs than VLC in my opinion, and they are also faster at seeking and at opening files. Both Movist and MPlayerX also support restoring the playback position but VLC doesn't. Movist is a bit more customizable than MPlayerX though: it supports for example centering subtitles vertically and using a custom implementation for full screen windows.\n\n\nA: This answer will be short: VLC. Has everything you need except the rotation. It's a media player, not a video editor.\nTo alter the playback speed in VLC: Go to to Playback → Playback Speed. You can also alter the playback speed using ⌘= and ⌘-.\nFor rotation, as user Iwillnotexist Idonotexist notes in the comments below, you can go to Window → Video Effects → Geometry → Transform.\nBonus: A list of some VLC keyboard shortcuts for OS X.\n\nA: I recommend IINA - The modern video player for macOS. It's Open source, supports URL streaming, Picture-in-Picture mode and other features.\n", "Q: Making Terminal recognize HandBrakeCLI commands I just downloaded HandBrake on my Mac to edit videos (and compress them).\nThe GUI works fine, however, when I type the command HandBrakeCLI in Terminal, it does NOT find the command.\nThe specific issue I am trying to resolve is that I want Terminal to know where to find the HandBrakeCLI commands and related tools.\nHow do I do that once I have a working GUI?\nHow do you \"activate\" the HandBrakeCLI command on MAC?\nThis is what I am typing into my terminal:\nusername~ $ HandBrakeCLI -h\n-bash: HandBrakeCLI: command not found\n\nI got the idea to type that command from:\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CLIGuide\n\nA: Have you downloaded the command line version?\nFrom HandBrake's CLIGuide:\n\ntell the shell to look for the program in the current working\n  directory.

How ever, your email could download them again from the email server (like gmail) if you kept them there.\n", "Q: Software to record videos on iphone that doesn't result on video sizes of tremendous sizes I often record videos with my phone that are 30 to 1hour 30 minutes long. However, the file sizes that result are ridiculously large. I want a way to still be able to record videos of that length and reduce the size a lot. If quality of the video has to be sacrificed, so be it.\nThe only way I could think of solving this is by downloading some kind of app that does that.\nTo tailor answer to my specific use case, consider a description of the type of things I record:\nI will use it to record talks, presentations, lectures, etc. I don't need anything that is too crazy. \nHowever, I do have some minimum requirements I expect from the app.\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to be able to control the quality of the video. If I record 30 minutes to 1 hour 30 minute talks, I don't need it to be HD. Just enough so that I can record the slides or the whiteboard/blackboard. This requirement is to control the SIZE of the video. Videos that are 8 GBs of size or more than 5 GB of size are useless to me.\n\n*I need to be able to control how I zoom in and out of my videos. For example, if I can't control very granularly how I close my video is, then it might not be useful.\n\n*I also need to be able to send these videos to my actual macbook computer somehow. Connecting it and then downloading it to the macbook pro is a great option.\n\n\nUsing the built in app is terrible for me because the videos are of ridiculous sizes (ranging from 5 to 10 GB size). I just need them to be much smaller and still be able to save them on my computer (and potentially upload them to youtube).\nI also downloaded the app VideoCamara+ and its great that it lets me control the quality, but it seems limited in its ability to zoom (it only has two modes of closeness as far as I know).\nI have also tried moviePro8 but it seems that its low resolutions results in really bad videos (as far as I can tell). VideoCamara+ has the same setting for low resolutions and its videos are not as bad.\n\nA: This is what I do.\nI use the VLC player almost exclusively since it can play anything.\nSince you want to save space and eventually download to youtube I would recommend a 2 step process.\nFirst record it in high quality.\nThen use a small app called Flv Crunch to convert \"any\" file format to flv type that is enormous size reduction and compatible with youtube.\nIt is very easy to use and control the settings.\n\nConvert files between flv, mpeg 1/2/4, 3gp, mp3, m4a, wmv, wma, avi, mkv, aiff, and others.\nThen delete the original (ok that was 3 steps :)\nwhy do it this way?\nI learned the hard way that once the event is over you are stuck with what ever quality you used to record. Thus I recommend you always record in high quality, since it is easy to reduce the file size to quality you want as end product.\nFor example you recorded something that needs to be magnified or altered for clarity, that would not be possible any more if recording in low quality.\nAbout Flash Video Format:\n\nFLV files are videos that are encoded by Adobe Flash software. They\n  can be played via the Adobe Flash Player, web browser plugins or one\n  of several third party programs. Since virtually everyone has the\n  player installed on their browsers, it has become the most common\n  online video viewing platform used on the Web today. As almost all\n  video sharing sites such as Youtube stream videos in Flash,\n  practically all browsers support and are compatible with the Flash\n  Video format and can play the video with ease. In addition to being an\n  online video viewing format, the Flash Video format is also what many\n  video-sharing sites convert videos to, from formats that were uploaded\n  by their users in something other than Flash. \nThis is because videos in the FLV format remain in high quality even\n  after compression to a smaller file size, which means that the videos\n  on the Web load quickly and won’t spend a lot of time using up\n  bandwidth. \nSome notable users of the Flash Video are Youtube, Yahoo! Video, VEVO,\n  Hulu and Myspace among many others.\n\n\nA: I use Pro Camera 8 for video recording. You can reduce the resolution of the video down to 640x480 and 30 FPS, which should result in significantly smaller videos than using the default Camera app.\nPro Camera also has a zoom slider (which is disabled by default) that can do digital zoom up to 6x. Videos save to the Camera Roll and can be synced with your Mac easily or shared via any method that the Photos app supports.\n", "Q: Update from iOS 6 to 7, but not to iOS 8? So...I'm still on iOS 6.1. I know, I know, pretty much nobody has iOS 6 now if they can help it. \nWell, I've recently freed up enough space on my iphone 5 to update to iOS 7, but I don't want the iOS 8, and I can't seem to get past that on the software update. Is there anyway I can get the 7 without having to get the 8 at all? Someone once suggested force update by computer, but I'm not sure how that works. Does anyone know, or am I stuck with iOS 6?\n\nA: As I had mentioned in my comment, Apple is no longer signing iOS 7 which means you can either update to iOS 8 or stay on iOS 6. Usually after an iOS update release, the previous iOS version is supported for a little while and then the signing stops. Right now, Apple signs iOS 8.1.\nIf you want to know what firmwares are being signed by Apple, there is a neat little website which is updated with the information - http://api.ineal.me/tss/status\n\nA: As Jash said, Apple is not signing iOS 7 updates anymore. The only articles I found discussing upgrading to 8 and then downgrading were dated around the 25th of September, and one of them even says at the top that as of September 29, Apple had stopped signing iOS 7 updates, so it was no longer possible to downgrade.\n", "Q: How to fix \"You are not allowed to use \"Application\"\" \nHow do I fix this message, I am Admin, Mobile.

To solve this I went through my installed applications and removed every VPN client and VM software that I don’t require any longer and rebooted my machine. After the reboot everything worked immediately.\n\nBut even if this is true, I just can not get rid of my VPN client for example. So, I still have no idea what steps I should take to solve the issue. I'll be very much obliged for any hint how to fix this problem.\n\nA: It looks like simply unloading a kernel extension which is using one of the major character devices is enough to get around the problem. For example, I had /dev/HAX so I was looking for instructions for uninstalling HAXm. I found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38354287/uninstalling-intel-haxm-on-mac-el-capitan which mentioned running sudo kextunload -b com.intel.kext.intelhaxm. After I did that, I was able to start a VMWare Fusion virtual machine without having to reboot.\n\nA: In case anyone is running into this with VMware Fusion 6 on Yosemite... I had the same issue and it seems OS X only has a limited amount of major device numbers, which are used by many different device drivers. VMware Fusion tries to load its device drivers on app startup, so if every major device number is already occupied, the drivers won't start.\nA VMware employee presented some ways to find out which drivers are using major device numbers in this post: https://communities.vmware.com/message/2341918#2341918\nWhen I ran ls -l /dev/ | grep '^c' | sort -nk 5 I discovered that FUSE for OS X and Tuxera NTFS each appeared about 20 times. I don't know for sure how to stop/restart these drivers - I had the luck that FUSE for OS X asked to update itself after I opened its preferences pane, this caused all fuse devices to disappear.\nAfter this, VMware Fusion was able to its drivers and the VMs booted again.\nEdit: I had the same issue again after using a VeraCrypt mounted image. This command line unloads the FUSE for OS X kernel extension if no filesystems are mounted:\nsudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfusefs\n\nA: According to a VMWare employee, VMWare Fusion 5.x is not compatible with OS X Yosemite, and recommends upgrading to version 6 or above. See the answer in this thread here: https://communities.vmware.com/message/2451191#2451191\nI was running into a similar problem and upgrading from Fusion 5 to Fusion 6.0.5 solved it for me.\n\nA: I had this same problem running Mac OS Mojave 10.14, VMWare Fusion 11.0.0, Macbook Pro 2017, and could not get the issue resolved until I rebooted my Macbook Pro. After restarting it, I launched VMWare Fusion and was prompted to allow it to access some resources  by going to System Preferences > Security & Privacy, and selecting allow.\nYour Apple computer may ask you to allow VMWare Fusion specific access as soon you open the app. If that's the case, just allow it and your VM's will work just fine. Thanks to everyone above for contributing to the conversation and for the solutions being suggested above.\n\nA: After having this issue with macOS High Sierra and VMWare Fusion 8.5.8, I was able to resolve it by allowing the system extension as described in http://planetvm.net/blog/?p=3240\nIn short; open System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, and from the General tab you should see a message stating System software from developer \"VMware, Inc.\" was blocked from loading. Clicking the Allow button resolved the issue for me.\n\nA: On Mac OS Mojave 10.14.4 I had this problem (same error) with VMware Fusion 11.0.0 but there was no request for permission in Preferences. So after some searching, this link helped me with disabling and re-enabling kernel extension of VMware Fusion:\nhttps://www.tweaking4all.com/forums/topic/macos-fix-vmware-fusion-version-mismatch-with-vmmon-module/\nNote: if your Mac's system integrity protection (SIP) is disabled, re-enable it. Shutdown, turn on and hold command+R until you get the apple logo, open terminal, execute this command: \n\ncsrutil enable; reboot\n\n\nA: I found a reboot fixed things, no need to sudo-run commands I'm not fully familiar with.

If you type\nwhich git\n\nin the Terminal, it should tell you which one is in your PATH. For me, the above command returns\n/usr/local/bin/git\n\nThe instructions you mention apparently install another copy of git here: /usr/local/git/bin/git\nYou need to add this new location to your PATH variable. To do so, navigate to your home directory and edit your .bash_profile by typing\ncd\nedit .bash_profile\n\nand add the following line to it:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\"\n\nSave the file, open a new Terminal window and try typing git --version again.

Since the Yosemite upgrade I can't change the log level with 'sudo launchctl log level debug'\nChecking top or Activity Monitor I can see that launchd itself is using the CPU heavily, not a process which it's spawning off. It has the highest cpu time on the box, 3 times that of kernel task, and vastly higher than Plex which is genuinely CPU heavy - video transcoding, and it supports a lot of clients in the house running frequently.\nNothing significant in the logs that I can see: the most frequent message:\n\n11/6/14 10:06:38.748 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]:\n  (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The\n  _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform.\n\nThat's only about 3-6 times per hour.\nI did a quick check through all the launchd daemons to find any error codes.\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  launchctl list | grep -v \"\\t0\\t\"\nPID Status  Label\n28122   -15 com.apple.Finder\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  sudo launchctl list | grep -v \"\\t0\\t\"\nPID Status  Label\n219 -43 com.apple.watchdogd\n21134   -15 com.apple.security.syspolicy\n\nInterestingly the -43 code on Watchdogd doesn't match the output of launchctl list:\nalex@smiley:~|⇒  sudo launchctl list com.apple.watchdogd\n{\n    \"StandardOutPath\" = \"/var/log/watchdogd/log\";\n    \"LimitLoadToSessionType\" = \"System\";\n    \"StandardErrorPath\" = \"/var/log/watchdogd/log\";\n    \"Label\" = \"com.apple.watchdogd\";\n    \"TimeOut\" = 30;\n    \"OnDemand\" = false;\n    \"LastExitStatus\" = 171;\n    \"PID\" = 219;\n    \"Program\" = \"/usr/libexec/watchdogd\";\n    \"ProgramArguments\" = (\n        \"/usr/libexec/watchdogd\";\n    );\n};\n\nIn any case, I'm not sure if they're symptomatic, or just a red-herring.\nHow can I find out what's making launchd DOS my computer?\n\nA: There is an app called LaunchControl which provides a very nice interface for creating/checking/modifying/disabling launch daemons and agents.

Unfortunately nobody can predict that. If you are concerned about a critical production system being put out of commission, it is probably best to wait for 10.10.1.\n\nA: If you're dependent on your computer for your livelihood, it's generally a good idea to always hold off on upgrading to a new major release at least until the first update has been released, which in the case with Yosemite will be 10.10.1.\nEveryone has very different workflows and no one will ever be able to guarantee that your workflow works on a new release. A reasonable assumption that anyone can make, however, is that your workflow will be much safer after the initial bugs of said release have been fixed.\n", "Q: Quick look .url saved webpages as rendered HTML I thought this was already possible in earlier versions of OS X but Yosemite seems to be missing the 'Web.qlgenerator' quick look plugin (or at least I am)\nHow do you enable .url quick look to see rendered html in Yosemite?\nI found this question of someone who wants to disable the rendered html and have it show to source code instead, so it should be possible  \n\nA: Quick Look doesn't make web requests, so it can't show the contents of the webpage without opening it. The question you linked was asking about .html files, with the actual source saved locally. .url files only include a URL, so without downloading the page it can't render anything.

I have also noticed that within the KeyChain Access utility, if you look at the contents of Local Items --> Passwords you will see that OS X now creates individual entries for different signatures now labeled Signature Annotation Privacy.\nWelcome assistance on my quest to figure out how to locate, export and import Preview's digital signatures from one Yosemite machine to another.\n\nA: If you enable Keychain in iCloud (System Preferences -> iCloud -> Keychain), signatures sync automatically.\n\nA: This is one of the very few times I actually utilize those 5 free GBs of iCloud space.\nIf you allow Preview to sync with iCloud all your signatures will also sync over. \nI just followed all these steps and realized once I was done that I then had two of the same signature on both computers; when I deleted one, one was also deleted off my other computer. \n\nA: I haven't had a chance to try this out yet, but the KeyChain entries actually contain a Base64 encoded plist file that appears to contain the data for the signature itself. I tried to decode the NSMutableData object saved in the plist file, but couldn't get past that point. My assumption at this point is that one might be able to \"share\" the keychain entry itself and copy it between computers, but again cannot confirm that this works.\n\nA: It's a little too obvious now.  The image data is recorded as the password entry in KeyChain.  So, to copy a signature, create a signature on your new Mac by camera or touchpad.  Then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the desired \"Signature Annotation Privacy\" entry in KeyChain on your old Mac.\n\n*Right-Click and \"Copy Password to Clipboard\"\n\n*Paste the text (base64 is all printable) into a text file\n\n*Copy the text file to your new Mac\n\n*Find the new \"Signature Annotation Privacy\" entry on your new Mac\n\n*Highlight and delete the Password field from that entry\n\n*Copy the contents of the text file to your clipboard\n\n*Paste the contents into the password field\n\n*Save Changes\n\n\nA: The short answer is, it's probably complicated and/or not worth the hassle. You can more easily retrieve the signature by simply applying it to a document and saving the doc. Earlier versions would let you copy and paste, but this one appears not to.\nLong version, with speculation:\nFrom opensnoop documentation:\n\nThe returned file descriptor is printed, a value of -1 indicates an error. This  can  be  useful  for troubleshooting to determine if applications are attempting to open files that do not exist.\n\nThe file you mention has a -1 next to it, so the open was attempted, but failed as it did not exist.\nSo where is the signature now? It's part of AnnotationKit which has little documentation online, but it seems to still use the Keychain key \"Signature Annotation Privacy\" ... I suspect it puts it in a Module Directory Services (MDS) database.\nFrom MDSSession in libsecurity_mds we can see the following:\n * The layout of the various MDS DB files on disk is as follows:\n *\n * /var/db/mds              -- owner = root, mode = 01777, world writable, sticky\n *    system/               -- owner = root, mode = 0755\n *       mdsObject.db       -- owner = root, mode = 0644, object DB\n *       mdsDirectory.db    -- owner = root, mode = 0644, MDS directory DB\n *       mds.lock           -- temporary, owner = root, protects creation of and \n *                             updates to previous two files\n *       mds.install.lock   -- owner = root, protects MDS_Install operation\n *    <uid>/                -- owner = <uid>, mode = 0700\n *       mdsObject.db       -- owner = <uid>, mode = 000, object DB\n *       mdsDirectory.db    -- owner = <uid>, mode = 000, MDS directory DB\n *       mds.lock           -- owner = <uid>, protects updates of previous two files\n\nThe mdsObject.db file appears to be a \"Common Security Services Manager\" or CSSM DB as documented in libsecurity_cssm.\nFrom this I expect it's using some kind of encrypted data store, since that's one of the options listed in CDSA documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/CDSA/CDSA.html\nThe main evidence I have to support this assertion is that there's a separate mdsObject/mdsDirectory/mds.lock structure within a folder called \"com.application.Preview\" so it's not just the system-level one, I would think. Not 100% on that, the main use of this kind of DB appears to be for system keys and certificates: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629299/2_chap06.htm\n\nA: I used the answer by user142836 and it works: unfortunately the step 1 is not obvious if you have a machine with a fresh install, even if with all the backups of the old OS...\nWhat I've done before step 1 is\n\n\n*\n\n*create a VM with the old OS (10.8 in my case)\n\n*\"restore\" from a old OS backup the file\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist\n\n\n*copy in the VM keychain from the old OS backup keychain the entry \"Preview Signature Privacy\" (copying the keychain file in the VM lets to open both the VM keychain and the backup keychain together, so it's possible to move/copy entries from one to the other; each keychain is locked with usually the user password and depending on the configuration the password of the VM keychain can be different from the backup keychain)\n\n*upgrade the VM to Yosemite: now the keychain on the VM has all I need!\n\n", "Q: How to change the font size of the Reminders app?

(I can't find a 3.5 GHz model actually so I couldn't verify your model and I also couldn't comment to ask.)\nBased on the assumption that you do in fact have a model with a 5400-rpm dive, your boot time doesn't seem unreasonable. Of course, the fact that you posted about it begs the question if your boot time was much shorter before Yosemite?\nAn SSD (or maybe a Fusion drive) would drastically improve your boot time (and probably overall performance as well) compared to a 5400-rpm drive.\nYour boot time might also improve if you do a clean install of Yosemite. I guess part of the reason you chose to upgrade is that you, like me, have got too much stuff that would be a hassle to reinstall? Having many applications and files on the HDD I believe could also affect boot time since the OS probably does some indexing and who-knows-what-else to the file system when the system is booting.\nTL;DR: If you have a 5400-rpm it's not unreasonable for boot times to be this long. Clean OS install might help but the biggest improvement would be seen with an upgrade to SSD.\n\nA: Sounds about right to me.\nMine would take that kind of time until I put an SSD in it.\nYou could try starting in Safe Mode [hold  shift   after the chimes] & see if there is any significant difference. \n\nA: Try System Preference->Startup Disk-> choose your HD and set to restart.

It just returned immediately without any output.\nThe solution was to have Terminal run as root and then delete, so start Terminal and run:\nsudo /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\n\nThen, in the \"root\" Terminal window:\nrm -rf /.Trashes/*\n\nRunning GrandPerspective again afterwards shows only 16MB of miscellaneous space.\n", "Q: Windows 8 slowdown since upgrading to Yosemite and Fusion 7 I was previously running Windows 8 pro in Fusion 6 on Mavericks.

I never have more than about 5/6 Chrome tabs open at any time.\n\n\nAll of these used to be practically instant in the old setup.\nAll of these things combined for me are completely unacceptable. Although they are all only small amounts of time on their own, when they're added up it's leading to huge amounts of frustration and ultimately loads of unnecessary lost time.\nI've done the usual of closing down any unnecessary background apps/services, I've increased the processor cores to 4 and increased the RAM to 6GB.

The primary use for this is that it enables old-style kernel panics that show scrolled text on the screen about why the system panicked, instead of displaying the gray backdrop and the message to merely restart your system. Alternative debug options are the following, though these will likely only be useful to kernel programmers:\n\n*\n\n*0x01 - Stop at boot time and wait for the debugger to attach\n\n*0x02 - Send kernel debugging output to the console\n\n*0x04 - Drop into debugger on a nonmaskable interrupt\n\n*0x08 - Send kernel debugging information to a serial port\n\n*0x10 - Make ddb the default debugger\n\n*0x20 - Output diagnostics information to the system log\n\n*0x40 - Allow the debugger to ARP and route\n\n*0x80 - Support old versions of gdb on newer systems\n\n*0x100 - Disable the graphical panic dialog screen\n\n\nSource: Boot argument options in OS X\nddb is just a debugger. It's absolutely safe to enable those kinds of modes to collect information once you experienced system issues.\n", "Q: Yosemite graphic artefacs Recently I was zooming on a picture on Yosemite and I came to this : \nWhich changed to this :\n\nWhen I moved the mouse...\nAs I changed three time my 2011 15\" MBP motherboard this year for GC issues I feared the worst but it seems that I'm not the only one, a few friends told me about this.\nIs anyone aware of some potential fix ?\nLog :\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.LidOpen (User)\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,004 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: assertion failed: 14A389: launchd + 160118 [55B9FF23-B298-321A-B776-CF7676586C04]: 0xe\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,002 discoveryd[52]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer fe80::225:4bff:fe03:5ff5 Port 58001 errno 65, fd 86, ErrLogCount 1 ResolverIntf:0\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,003 discoveryd[52]: Basic DNSResolver UDNS Send(): UDP Sendto() failed to DNSNameServer fe80::225:4bff:fe03:5ff5 Port 58001 errno 65, fd 86, ErrLogCount 2 ResolverIntf:0\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,004 watchdogd[311]: [watchdog_daemon] @(         pm_callback) - ref=0x0 msg_type=0xe0000320 msg=0x0\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: Previous sleep cause: 5\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltGenericHAL::earlyWake - complete - took 1 milliseconds\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,006 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: assertion failed: 14A389: launchd + 160118 [55B9FF23-B298-321A-B776-CF7676586C04]: 0xe\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,038 discoveryd[52]: Basic DNSResolver UDNSServer:: PowerState is Wakeup\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: TBT W (1): 0 [x]\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,137 sharingd[355]: 17:58:10.136 : SDStatusMonitor::kStatusWirelessPowerChanged\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,329 WindowServer[159]: CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification [110872658795510]: posting kCGSDisplayDidWake\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,331 WindowServer[159]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Reordering authw 0x7f919c2584a0(2004) (lock state: 3)\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,331 WindowServer[159]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: err 0x0\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,447 apsd[53]: Peer [pid=328] requested push wake but lacks APSPushWakeEntitlement\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,448 identityservicesd[371]: <IMMacNotificationCenterManager: 0x7fd04e2223b0>: notification observer: com.apple.iChat   notification: __CFNotification 0x7fd04e21c780 {name = _NSDoNotDisturbDisabledNotification}\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,470 identityservicesd[371]: <IMMacNotificationCenterManager: 0x7fd04e2223b0>:    NC Disabled: NO\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,477 identityservicesd[371]: <IMMacNotificationCenterManager: 0x7fd04e2223b0>:   DND Enabled: NO\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,477 identityservicesd[371]: <IMMacNotificationCenterManager: 0x7fd04e2223b0>: Updating enabled: YES   (Topics: (\n))\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: en1: 802.11d country code set to 'FR'.\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,000 kernel[0]: en1: Supported channels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 100 104 108 112 116 120 124 128 132 136 140\n07/11/2014 17:58:10,494 SubmitDiagInfo[472]: Couldn't load config file from on-disk location.

Not convinced this is the GPU problem. I have the 2010 MBP 6,2, and had the GPU replaced under a special extended warranty last August 2014 by Apple. About a month ago, I got the exact same screens as above. I took it into the Apple Store and they ran a full test, including video. It passed.\nFor now, I have turned off the \"automatically switch graphics\" in energy saver. \nIf you look at the console logs when this happens, it looks like a kernel panic associated with the Intel chipset. July 1, 2015 (today) I see Apple has released an update that deals with some Intel buffer overflows.\nI think this is a Yosemite thing, and not a hardware thing. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 rebooting on startup When booting up and logging into my MacBook Pro, I get the following error message:\nlocalhost com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] <Emergency>: Boot task failed: fsck-safe\nlocalhost com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] <Emergency>: Shutting down in 3 seconds.\n\nThis is an image of the error:\n\nI am running OS X Yosemite, on a mid 2011 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Hold alt during startup, you will then be able to boot from something called \"recovery partition\". When that is booted, in the menu select \"disk utility\" and try to repair disk and/or volume.\n\nA: Based on the fsck error that would be your Samsung SSD failing.\nSince you can not boot in Safe mode or any other including recovery, your only option is to boot from a external drive.\nThen try to repair your hard drive.\n\nA: Tried everything posted here and in other Apple forums but it wouldn't work. In the end, I booted using a USB drive and deleted all existing partitions on the failing SSD. Once all partitions were cleaned, I reinstalled Yosemite and the computer is up and running again.\n\nA: Similar symptoms on my 2011 MBP.\nThe shutdown would occur during the boot process as the progress bar is loading, about 50-60% of the way the machine would just shutdown, everytime.\nI tried resetting the PRAM and SMC controller as per Apple's instructions. This didn't help directly.\nI ended up going into internet recovery mode, and attempted to use the Disk Utility to repair/diagnose the main HD. Disk Utility couldn't mount it or perform First Aid.\nSo I opened up the terminal and ended up doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unlocking my encrypted drive.\n\n*Mounting the drive with mount_hfs and specifically ignoring journalling. If this step succeeds, I'd spend some time backing up important files to an external drive or USB stick, as this may be your only chance to do so if you've got an incurable issue with your HD.\n\n*diskutil disableJournal on the drive after it mounted.\n\n*diskutil enableJournal on the drive.\n\n*diskutil unmount the drive.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nStep 1 is explained here (archive).\nStep 2-5 are explained in a bit more detail here (archive).\nMy system then booted up correctly and seems to be working okay. I suppose the issue was a corrupt journal file that the system kept on failing on each time it booted, and by disabling/re-enabling the journal I effective \"cleaned\" it up. I can also confirm that steps 3 & 4 cleared out some large *journal* files in the root of the problematic drive.\n", "Q: As a user with multiple monitors attached to my Mac, how does it select which one a new window is opened on? I have a Macintosh [MacBook Pro] with multiple monitors. There's the built in laptop display and I additional have a Apple Thunderbolt Display and another third party monitor attached via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort adapter. This is a total of three displays. \nWhen, in an application, I open a new window, the new window doesn't often open on the display I which currently had focus, but seems to open randomly across the three displays. That is I may have an open, active, foreground window on the Thunderbolt Display and when cmd-N'ing to open a new window it may open on the laptop screen or the third display. \nHow is Mac OS X deciding which display to open the new window on and can this be selectively changed to alway open on the currently active display?\n\nA: If you right click on any icon in your dock, you could assign an app to a display.\n\n\nA: Using an answer to be able to post image...\nMonitor differentiation looks like it's new to Yosemite. Mavericks doesn't show anything beyond simply assigning a Desktop, unfortunately.\nThere is the possibility it's affected by having monitors set to separate spaces or not, but I'm not going to break 12 Spaces of setup just to test that theory ;-)\n\nI do find some apps will remember which screen, some will not, consistently. MS Remote Desktop will certainly not, for me. Though it will remember which screen the initial remote list window should be on, every remote session I open launches on the Primary monitor. \nI think in the OP's case, an added complexity may be that, as it's a laptop, the external screens may not always be connected. Once a screen is removed, the Finder will force any window on that screen back to the Primary. I don't know whether that would be 'remembered' even if the app wasn't launched at any time its preferred monitor was disconnected.\n", "Q: Help to Fix My Computer How do I fix my Mac? Okay so I'm in a weird spot with my Mac. It has no startup up disk.  I have the installation disk for it but my super drive does not work.  I'm wondering can I boot it from a USB?  I do not care if it uses apples software or Linux.  I just want to get it to work so icon access the internet.\nI have access to window computers and Mac computers if that helps.

Is it possible to get another USB Disk Drive? \nI'm assuming that since you don't have \"full\" access to the other Macs that the Disk Utility app on them is inaccessible to you as well. Check on that, if you can. IF you can get into Disk Utility on one of the other Macs, you might be able to connect the two using a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable and go into Target Disk Mode to restore your Mac.\nAnother option would be to use the Terminal to create your own bootable USB drive. Even if its your buddy's MacBook, you should still be able to log into the App Store, download the installer for whatever version you bought, and use the built-in createinstallmedia to make a bootable drive.\nIf both of these options don't work, I think your next best bet is to buy an install disk off eBay or something. Hardly ideal, but then at least you'd have them if this happens again.\n\nA: Wow thats a hum dinger of a problem. \nFrom what I understand you only have terminal access to both mac and linux.\nBelow are the directions for both linux and mac\nFor your linux machine you will need to install x11 and firefox if they are not already installed. If you have ownership rights and are using apt as your package manager type sudo apt-get install firefox x11. For other package managers on linux you will have to consult someone else. I only have experience with apt. If you don't have ownership rights you will have to install firefox and x11 locally by downloading the source and compiling them. Firefox can be downloaded from the terminal using Firefox's FTP server. I have no idea how to get the x11 source for linux. Realistically unless the machine you are working on is a cluster you should have these software already installed even if no GUI is present.\nAfter the installation type firefox in the terminal. Go to the linux distro webpage and download the os onto your USB.\nFor mac osx you have a multitude of options. If you want a linux distro, you can type open -a Safari or open -a Firefox to open the Safari or Firefox apts. Than go to linux distro's website and download the os to USb. If you want a OS X distro type open -a Software\\ Update. Download a copy of the OS X distro than use the terminal to copy the distro unto the USB. By the way each version of OS X has a different terminal command for copying OS X onto a USB or DVD. So you'll have to look up this command. \nOnce you have your OS on your USB plug in to the computer and install. \n", "Q: Booting from Windows USB Key Overwrote EFI - Mac No Longer Boots I'm using a macbook pro running Yosemite. I was trying to create installation media to install linux on an SD card, and I used a USB key that had a bootable windows installation on it. I thought I had overwritten it, and booted from it, expecting the linux installation to boot up. Instead, the old windows OS started up, and after I shut it back down, it kernel panicked every time it tried to restart. After glancing around, it appears that the windows installation added an MBR boot partition where it shouldn't have been, and overwrote the normal EFI scheme.\nI cannot paste output directly, as the only way to boot from the computer in question is to boot with a yosemite install drive, but currently the partition map is one \"disk0\" with no partitions, of the full size of the hard drive, and then various other disks representing the Yosemite install disk. I've tried to use dd to copy the EFI scheme from the Yosemite Install \"disk1s1\" to the hard disk \"disk0s1\" but it returns \"Operation not Supported.\"\nLet me know if I can give any more information. Thanks!\n\nA: If your EFI is not working, you will need to restore it.\nDownload from here for your model.\nThen follow the procedure described here.\n", "Q: Install older OS X on latest Mac Mini I need Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) in order to work with some legacy software and I want to buy new Mac Mini computer.\nIs it possible to install this OS on a new Mac Mini or it's not compatible with it?\nIf so, what is the latest model of Mac Mini that I can use in this scenario?\n\nA: You can not install older OS X versions on newer models, the old OS X version are missing the required drivers for hardware not even available when the OS X version was released.\nI see several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may (legally) install 10.6.8 Server in a VM (Parallels or VMware) though. \n\n*The latest MacMini supporting 10.6.8 is the MacMini4,1: Apple Mac mini \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.4, Apple Mac mini \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.66 & Apple Mac mini \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.66 (Server)\n\n*With some workarounds and hazzle you will get 10.6.8 working on MacMini5,1 and MacMini5,2. In the comments there (March 12, 2013 Gregg Tomlinson) even a working MacMini6,1 is mentioned:\n\nI believe it does – I am using this on a 2012 MacMini that came with Snow Leopard [sic!], and reverse-engineered it to use 10.6 with this methodology.\n\n\nA: While you can't run an older Mac OS X version on hardware that predates it (driver issues) if you must run Snow Leopard on newer OS X hardware consider installing it under the free VirtualBox virtual machine. It runs Snow Leopard and Snow Leopard Server just fine, albeit slightly slower. Make sure you have adequate RAM. \n\nA: Can’t you partiton the disk and do an install from a Time Machine back-up?\nThen press alt at start and choose which system you want to boot from.\nOf course this means wiping your existing system and reinstalling.\n", "Q: waking up from locked screen with just keyboard I'm on OS X 10.9.5.

When \"show all tabs\" is activated, you can type some text to filter the tabs to the one you want. However, once I have a single tab visible, it would be very nice to be able to activate that tab. This would allow \"spotlight\" type functionality for tabs.\nHowever, it doesn't seem like there is a keyboard shortcut to activate the tab once I've searched for it, so I'm forced to click the tab with my mouse! This seems like an oversight, I can't believe Apple would add a nice way to filter the tabs, but no way to select one!\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: I have tried the following key combinations in an attempt to do this, to no effect: \n\n\n*\n\n*Command+Return    ...+Space\n\n*Option+Return      ...+Space\n\n*Control+Return    ...+Space\n\n*Command+Shift+\\  (The \"Show All Tabs\" Command on my Macbook)\n\n\nThis leads me to believe that it really is an oversight on Apple's part. \nKludge: Create An Automator Command to Simulate A Mouse Click\nI used code that I found at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3708948 to put together the following AppleScripts: \nAttempt 1: Didn't Work\nI ran this code in an Applescript wrapped in an Automator Service mapped to \"Command+Shift+Option+Control+Space\", using the numbers I get from pressing \"Command+Control+Shift+4\" to get the address for the area (600 pixels horizontal from left, 300 pixels vertical from top), and it would work in normal Safari (pressing the key combination would make the mouse click at that pixel address), but it had no effect when the same key command was run in the \"Show All Tabs\" mode in Safari!\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell process \"Safari\"\n                click at {600, 300}\n            end tell\n        end tell\n\n        return input\n    end run\n\nAttempt #2: Worked, but Not Feasible\nI did get a key command working with the following Applescript wrapped in an Automator Service, but it took 5.125 seconds to complete:( \n    on run {input, parameters}\n\n    set x to 600\n    set y to 150\n\n    do shell script \"\n/usr/bin/python <<END\nimport sys\nimport time\nfrom Quartz.CoreGraphics import *\ndef mouseEvent(type, posx, posy):\n          theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(None, type, (posx,posy), kCGMouseButtonLeft)\n          CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent)\ndef mousemove(posx,posy):\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventMouseMoved, posx,posy);\ndef mouseclick(posx,posy):\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseDown, posx,posy);\n          mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseUp, posx,posy);\nourEvent = CGEventCreate(None);\ncurrentpos=CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent);             # Save current mouse position\nmouseclick(\" & x & \",\" & y & \");\nmousemove(int(currentpos.x),int(currentpos.y));      # Restore mouse position\nEND\"\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: I think I got your answer.

However, it is a Wi-Fi only model, so my second question is: [2] Is it necessary to have a cellular iPad for SMS relay to work?\n\nA: I think you are confusing this with the requirement for Bluetooth LE to be able to do Handoff.\nSMS Relay uses Wi-Fi or, if available, your phone's 3G/4G connection.\nFrom How to Enable SMS Relay on Your Mac, iPad and iPhone - point 3 might be the salient one...\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure your Mac, iPad and iPhone are all connected to the same Wi-Fi connection.  \n  \n*Make sure all of the devices are logged-in to the same iCloud account.\n  You don’t want to be receiving your father’s phone calls, do you?  \n  \n*Starting with your iPhone first – and this is important, because I did it backwards and messed everything up – open Settings > Messages and tap “Text Message Forwarding.”  \n  \n*Choose the devices on your home network that you’d like to receive SMS messages on – in this case, I chose my MacBook Air and my iPad.  \n  \n*You should receive a code on your iMac and iPad.  \n  \n*Enter that code into the prompt on your iPhone.  \n  \n\nThis might also be useful - FYI...SMS Forwarding does not require WiFi to work\n", "Q: How do I add media not in iPhoto to a Keynote presentation? I want to use folders other than iPhoto and Photo Booth when adding media in iWork applications. For example when using Keynote, this pops up:\n\nHow do I add folders to the pop-over menu?\n\nA: You can\n\n*\n\n*drag them in from a Finder window\n\n\n*copy and paste from somewhere else\n\n\n*or use Insert > Choose...\nYou can also add the folders by dragging them into the media browser, as described in Macworld's article Add more folders to the Media Browser.\n\nFirst, in your iWork program, make sure the tab of the Media Browser that you’d like to modify is selected, then switch to the Finder. Find the folder you’d like to add, and start dragging it. Now press Command-Tab—while still dragging the folder—and switch to your iWork application. When the iWork program becomes active, your floating palettes will show up, and you can then drop the dragged folder into the Media Browser. (You can do the same thing using Exposé instead of Command-Tab, if you prefer.)\nTo remove folders you’ve added, Control-click on the folder in the Media Browser and select Remove Folder from the pop-up menu. You can only remove top-level folders, not folders within folders, in this manner. To get rid of all the folders you’ve added, Control-click on the Folders folder, and select Remove Folders from the pop-up menu.\n\n", "Q: iPhone Mail.app - Showing Disabled Email Accounts I have lots of emails on my iPhone from an old account that I no longer use. Mail reminds me often that it cannot connect to the account.\nWhen I uncheck the account from email preferences, the  account disappears completely from Mail.\nHow can I keep the emails in my application so I can browse through them, while configuring Mail not to try checking for new mail?\niPhone 5s iOS 7.1.2 \n\nA: When you remove an email account from the iOS mail app, it removes all the emails (and other data) from the device. There is no way to keep mail on the device from an account that was removed. \nIf you leave the account(s) signed in to the device, you can set the mail app to only fetch new mail manually. This would allow you to have the mail on your device, without getting new mail automatically.\nEDIT\nTo fetch manually, go into Settings > Mail, Contacts, and Calendars > Fetch New Data.

I have a really nice Matrix  inspired screensaver. I would like to have the moving screensaver to be placed as my Desktop background image. \nHow can I set my screensaver as a background image for the desktop ?\n\nA: You have to open terminal and type cd /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources\nand ./ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background. It will take a lot of resources though, so to quit it, you have to quit the terminal window.\nsource: TUAW and Lifehacker\n\nA: You also can create an plist file that you place in your user LaunchAgent folder.  \n/Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist\n\nYou than loaded at a terminal with:\nlaunchctl load /Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist\n\nOr unload it with:\nlaunchctl unload /Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist\n\nHere is the content of this plist file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>KeepAlive</key>\n<true/>\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.username.runscreensaver</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine</string>\n    <string>-background</string>\n</array>\n<key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n<integer>0</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nUnfortunately (at least under 10.9.5) the ScreenSaverEngine set the window level wrong (below kCGDesktopWindowLevel) to work correct with mission control and spaces witch leads to a few issues during restart, change screen, login and logout that leads to an invisible screensaver . \nTo fix this issues you need to write your own screensaver that inherits the properties of ScreenSaverEngine while running and correct the window level (eg.

Now when i boot my macbook pro up it takes about 5 seconds to get from powered off to the log on screen, but then when i enter my password it shows a loading bar that slowly fills and my user icon changes to an apple logo. Then after about 20 seconds it logs in. Moreoever the log on screen is gray with the user icons, which is not my background on my account. But if i log in and then log out it changes the log in screen to be my desktop background.\nThis is a big change from my old mavericks where it took longer to boot up but instantly logged me in. I thought SSDs had super quick boot and log in times.\nHere is a video of what is occurring to me.\nIt shows the quick boot to log on screen with the strange gray background, me logging in and having my icon change to an apple with a loading bar under it, and then me going to a website, and logging out, notice that after i log out the log on screen changes to my desktop background. And then i log in again and it goes quickly unlike the first time.\nLink to console messages from boot\nAfter doing a restore via the net with cmd Option R it seems to be booting normally\nHere is a link to the console messages now after i restored it.\n\nA: This is normal behaviour for Yosemite for users with FileVault enabled (i.e. Your Mac's primary disk is encrypted). \nThe authentication process is done earlier because without authorisation from the user the OS cannot access the rest of the disk.\nThis is a good thing, and I think you are (mostly) mistaken that it takes longer to boot up — since now you are watching the screen and waiting after entering your login/password the result is that one fixates on the screen and the time it takes to present the OS X graphical user environment, and comparing it with your prior experience of how much time it took to go from authentication to the GU environment. But the total time from power up shouldn't be noticeably longer.\nTo disable this behaviour:\nOpen System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault\nFrom there you can click on the 'Turn off FileVault', after which you will be asked to restart and you will have the normal boot up behaviour and the OS will start to decrypt your disk in the background.\n\nEDIT: The 'extra long' boot time with FileVault occurs once only, at the first startup/restart after enabling FileVault as the OS is finishing the process required. After this, it should be as fast as normal. I double-checked this whole process by disabling FileVault and re-enabling it on one of my machines so I could be sure.\nNb. (if there is any slight increased length of time in booting up, it is more likely as a result of the disk encryption not because of your upgrade to Yosemite per se.)\n", "Q: Yosemite Apple Brown highlight color Is it possible to find the RGB values of the \"Apple Brown\" highlight color Apple introduced in Yosemite? \n\nA: You can use builtin app called Digital Color Meter.app which can be found in /Applications/Utilities.

You will lose any new files, changes, etc. that have been made since you upgraded to Yosemite, unless you back these up before you attempt to downgrade.\nFollow these steps, from OS X Daily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac with Yosemite and hold down Command+R to enter Recovery mode (You can also hold Option and choose “Recovery HD”, or if you have a Yosemite USB installer key, you can boot from that too)\n\n\n*At the OS X Utilities menu, choose “Restore From Time Machine Backup”\n\n\n*Connect the Time Machine drive that contains the most recent Mavericks backup to the Mac (typically through USB or Thunderbolt), then click “Continue”\n\n\n*At the “Select a Backup Source” screen, choose the Time Machine volume used for the Mavericks backup and click Continue\n\n\n*Under “Backup Date & Time”, select the most recent backup made from OS X Mavericks – double-check the OS X Version menu to make sure it’s “10.9.5” (or whatever 10.9.x you had previously), then click Continue again\n\n\n*Choose the Destination drive (the Yosemite volume you want to downgrade) to restore the OS X Mavericks backup to – this will erase OS X Yosemite and revert back to Mavericks on that drive, be sure you backed up all files created between the most recent backup date and now or you will lose them – click on “Restore” to begin the downgrade process\n...\nThe downgrade process can take quite a while depending on the size of the backup, the amount of files on the drive, the speed of the Mac, and the speed of the hard drive. Expect this process to take several hours if not many hours, for a very large hard drive of stuff, it could easily take overnight if not a full day to complete hundreds of GB of file transfers. Do not interrupt the restore process, otherwise you would need to start over.\n\n\nA: I think Yosemite is the ugliest Mac OS that Apple has ever released (and I have been there since the beginning). I think the look-and-feel is appalling, and I cannot stomach it ... so have reverted to Mavericks.\nIf you do not have a Time Machine backup, then there are two main options:\n1. Command-R:  Recovery system\nIf you have a newer Mac, when you boot up your Mac, hold down Command-R ... this allows you to install a new copy of OS X Mavericks which it will download from the Apple servers on the internet.\nDownside:  it does not let you install Mavericks when you have Yosemite already installed, so you need to Erase your HD using Disk utility (make a backup first, of course), and then re-boot your Mac, hold down Command-R, and install a fresh system - you end up with a brand new Mac. \nFor more detail, see:  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4718\n2.  Bootable Mavericks USB stick\nIn theory, if you have Mavericks installed as a bootable USB stick, you should be able to install Mavericks from that. It didn't actually work for me, perhaps because my version of Mavericks on the USB stick (Jan 2014) came out before the date I purchased my Macbook Air ... and I had to use the recovery system which worked fine ... albeit starting clean from fresh.\nFor help creating a bootable Mavericks install USB stick:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/how-to-make-your-own-bootable-os-x-10-9-mavericks-usb-install-drive/\nThere is also an article in Macworld on how to revert to Mavericks from Yosemite:\nhttp://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/revert-back-mavericks-from-yosemite-3581872/\n", "Q: Terminal command to kick selected users off my network There are lots of ports in my small office but sometimes I want to kick out people who are accessing internet instead of doing their job. With arp -a i can look for all of the connected users. But how to kick them off a network. Please don't tell me Router's conf. I want to do this via terminal itself. There are ways to do that, i saw my friend doing that.\n\nA: Unless your desktop is the central proxy server you will have to go through the router. Just because you can see other machines with arp doesn't mean you can do anything with them.\nKicking them off the network via the router will usually be total - does the office staff depend on the network do do their jobs?\nA better way is running your own DNS server. You can then simply redirect any time-sucking service somewhere else in a manner that makes it look like the site is temporarily down, like this:\n*.facebook.com IN A 192.168.1.252\n\n192.168.1.252 runs an Apache vhost site named facebook.com, it serves up a clone of the FB maintenance page for any URL.\nIt will take a very network-savvy user to figure it out, and you won't be the demon boss (at least not right away).

It’s a tool I recently developed which does exactly that — it kicks devices off your Local Area Network.\n\n\nA: Good question. \nAdmins used to be able to block mac addresses at the router, but now pervasive tools for mac address spoofing allow users to easily overcome blacklists or mimic trusted computers. \nIf it is your own network and you do not recognize a computer attached to it, and you want them to go away, and have no way of contacting them, you can use the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (loic) to launch a denial of service attack on the unwelcome guest computer and overwhelm it with traffic. Currently denial of service attacks are among the few one-on-one methods of defending your network from a computer that has gained access without permission. Before 2015 this was inadvisable, but these days, cyberwar is upon us, so, use it with care, only in self defense and don't \"lock on\" to targets outside of your local network. \nThere are versions of the LOIC in most app stores. It is easy to use. Enter the ip address of the target, write them a nice note, lock on, and fire away until they crash off (or fire back).

I have logged out from another Apple account and logged in using another email address. However, the App Store keeps asking me for the password of the old account (showing its email and there is no way to change it). I have done a full reboot but no help.\nHow do I completely remove this account from the iPad App Store?\nMy dad seems to have the same problem with his iPhone 6, and what he did was restore factory settings. That will take me lots of time so I only consider it as last option.\n\nA: It sounds like there's a little confusion. Let me elaborate a little bit... I used to be a Senior Advisor for Apple and this was by far the most common call.\nFirst, migrating to a new Apple ID can be difficult, but you can do it. To make sure all future purchases ask for your new Apple ID, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store and then select your Apple ID. Is this your new one or your old one? If it's your old one, tap \"Sign Out\" and try signing in with your new one. All future purchases should then prompt you for your new Apple ID and password.\nHowever, keep in mind that any apps that you've already downloaded with your old Apple ID will prompt you for that old Apple ID and password when the apps need to be updated. (This is what everyone else is talking about). In order to never see or think about that old Apple ID again, you'll need to delete those apps over time and re-purchase them on your new Apple ID.\nSecond, it is imperative that you understand what email addresses are and aren't associated with each Apple ID. To check this out, go to id.apple.com and sign in to each of them. It is possible to have multiple emails associated with an Apple ID. It is also possible to have an \"alternate Apple ID,\" which basically means you can use either to sign in.\nOne more thing—with the announcement of iOS 8, Apple IDs can be conjoined or paired using Family Sharing. It may just be more confusing, but check out the synopsis on Apple's website here.\n\nA: This is because some of the currently installed apps on the device are installed with the old Apple ID. You need to uninstall these apps and reinstall them with the new Apple ID.\n", "Q: How did the function \"Save As…\" change to \"Duplicate\"?

It will occasionally ask to save new login data but never offers to fill in that info when I go to that website.  All the logins from iOS 7 are in the password file but it never uses any of the old data nor ask to save those websites again.  The password file has the four digit password which I did not have on iOS 7.  I have checked the settings several times and tried different settings and nothing works.  The settings appear to be correctly.\n\nA: Since iOS is a sandbox I do not know of any tools to help reset the keychain and download it again with out resetting all settings. Do you have the iCloud Keychain running, is it backed up via iCloud? If so then trying to reinstall your iCloud data back may fix the issue. Start by going to Setting> General>Reset reset all settings. If this does not work try  erase all content and settings and restore from and iCloud backup. If you are still acing issues the try a  full erase of the iOS and your data. Then restore from an iCloud backup. \n\nA: If your keyboard is in “split” mode, then the keychain/password option does not show up in the middle of the bottom of the screen. Un-split your onscreen keyboard (tap both sides of the keyboard at the same time and slide your fingers inward) and keychain should show up again when you click into the user or password boxes.\n", "Q: Mac boot menu not showing up with different keyboards I have a Macbook White from 2010. I have been using it for a while and everything works except the internal keyboard which is broken because of a tea spill. An external PC-keyboard (USB) is attached though but it doesn't work properly.\nI had installed Yosemite and it worked fine, but later I decided to reinstall Mountain Lion again.\nI tried to enter the boot menu with the alt-button to reboot to my second partition but it didn't work. \nSo I've changed the Start Volume in the System Preferences in Yosemite which was successful but now I'm stuck in the 'Mountain Lion Install'-partition which just loads to a grey screen and nothing else happens.\nIs there any solution guys?\n\nA: I also use a non-mac keyboard and have seen the issue where it skips the boot menu. The native keyboard works both from a cold boot and a soft reboot. The 3rd party keyboard only works from a cold boot and not from a reboot. You should be able to power down your Mac and power it back on and have the boot menu work with any keyboard.\nI've also read a few places that it matters which USB port you use for the third party keyboard (for the boot menu specifically). You could try moving the keyboard around to see if you get the desired behavior. YMMV.\n\nA: I have fixed the problem. I fixed it by mounting the hard drive on another MacBook and there i deleted the partition for \"Montain Lion-Install\"-partition. When i mounted the hard drive back to my MacBook it booted to the secound partition (Yosemite). But i have another problem, how do i make the boot loader work now from the OS X Yosemite?\n", "Q: Missing .Bash Files in ~/ While uninstalling/removing home-brew, node, and yeoman...I noted that I don't have a .bashrc or .bash_profile in my home directory.

Best of luck.\n", "Q: Fixing a messed up $PATH in Yosemite I had troubles installing node with Homebrew as Homebrew does something weird to the node install that installing Yeoman generators seems to be hindered a bit. My issue, however, is that I think Homebrew messed up my $PATH.\nI installed node via the download from their site and it says:\n\nMake sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.\n\nHowever when I go into iTerm and type echo $PATH I get:\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/git/bin\n\nIs this normal, or do I have to fix something?\nI thought it would just spit out /usr/local/bin/.\n\nA: This is normal. System binaries are located in /usr/bin and other such directories that need to be in your path so that you can run them without needing to type the entire path in your shell.\nHomebrew and other such package managers tell you to add the path to the folder for their own binaries so that they can also be run without typing the entire path. This folder should be added to the list of paths so that both the original binaries and the new binaries can be run in the same way.\nFWIW I have plenty of paths in my $PATH:\n/Users/grgarside/.autojump/bin:/Users/grgarside/.autojump/bin:/Users/grgarside/.rvm/gems/ru\nby-2.0.0-p247/bin:/Users/grgarside/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p247@global/bin:/Users/grgarside/.r\nvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p247/bin:/Users/grgarside/.rvm/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr\n/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sb\nin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Users/grgarside/.rvm/bin\n\n", "Q: \"Import from Scanner\" greyed out in Preview app I have a Canon Pixma MG6300 printer/scanner for which I properly installed the drivers.\nI know it is supposed to show in the Preview app under File > Import from Scanner.

This will remove all your printers.\n\n*Go to Utilities and open Disk Utility.  Click Macintosh HD in the left panel and then click Repair Disc Permissions in the right panel.\n\n*Restart your computer.\n\n*Re-install your printer.\n\n\nA: Turned out my problem was that the scanner wasn't connected. Plugging in the USB helped a lot.\n\nA: Before reseting & restarting, I recommend trying just step 2:\nGo to Utilities and open Disk Utility. Click Macintosh HD in the left panel and then click Repair Disc Permissions in the right panel.\nIf that isn't sufficient, then go through all the steps that Chunghao gave.\n\nA: My problem was that the printer was installed with the default AirPrint driver instead of the actual HP driver. I reset the printing system then re-installed the printer, explicitly choosing the HP driver (which it automatically downloaded and installed, causing the printer to whir and click a few times in the process). \nAfter that, the \"Import from HP Laserjet...\" option started showing up in the Preview \"Print\" menu. \n", "Q: Yosemite install stuck and I need help!

I installed Yosemite on one of my machines (and uninstalled it a short time later). \nNow, running Mavericks, every time I open a program that uses iCloud (like Numbers), I'm greeted with this message. \n\nAfter clicking OK, I can still read documents stored on iCloud, I really can't see any functionality differences. After I pick a file, I get the same dialog box again, and click OK again, and I can edit and save my file.  \nThis is extremely obnoxious.\nI would guess that I can't convert my account to non-iCloud Drive, which is fine, I don't really depend on \"iCloud\" for anything. \nMy question is, how can I get rid of the error message? \n\nA: Guesswork, but the bad news is you should have switched it off before reverting, if at all possible.  \nLooking through the various QAs at Apple forums would tend to lead to the conclusion that once you have upgraded to iCloud Drive it cannot be reverted. You may be able to switch it off from https://icloud.com but I can't test as I have never enabled it on my machines.\nApple have never been too concerned about people wanting to rewind.\nGeneral iCloud Drive info from Apple doesn't cover it, nor does the switching off iCloud Drive FAQ\n", "Q: Download pics not shown in \"DCIM\" folder to PC When my Iphone is connected to the PC Itunes shows it contains 301 photos in the storage bar at the bottom of the Window.

The results are different - it seems that the Finder doesn't search within sub-directories. Is there a way to change this?\n\n\nA: This seems like a bug with Spotlight in OS X.\nSpotlight should search recursively in whatever directory it is told to, however after some testing it seems this functionality breaks with some exFAT and NTFS partitions.\nIf you want to search by name in such cases, you can use 'find':\nfind /path/to/folder -name \"*name*\"\n\n", "Q: How to beautify binary dict files?

It reads a plist file, checks and memorizes if it is\n  binary, converts it to plain text if necessary and turns on syntax\n  highlinghting for XML. When you save the file again, it is converted\n  to binary again for writing if it was binary in the beginning. If the\n  file was not binary or if the conversion to binary fails (which can\n  happen if you have syntax errors in your file), the file is stored in\n  text format. If an originally-binary plist is saved as plain text due\n  to syntax errors and you fix the errors and save the file again, it is\n  written in binary format. If you open a binary file and just view it\n  without making any changes, you can still exit from vim using the\n  normal :q (no need for :q!) and the file is left untouched (still in\n  binary format).

Command+Tab works fine to switch applications. But Command+Shift+Tab doesn’t! The same shift key works to capitalize letters, so what on earth is going on?\nThis is the case with both the left and right side, and combinations of the two. Command+Shift+Tab results in no action--it's not that the shift is being ignored, it kills the combo (i.e. Command+Shift+Tab does not bring up the application switcher, and pressing it while the application switcher is up results in no movement, not movement to the right). Furthermore, Command+Shift+Tab works fine on the built-in keyboard!\nAnd while I was typing this I remembered something else: Shift+Tab doesn’t work either (e.g. to move to the previous form field) But it works fine on the MBP built-in keyboard!\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: Sounds like a hardware problem based on the comments. Until you can try a new one, you could get the same action by using use Cmd+Tab (holding down Cmd but just tapping Tab) to bring up the switcher, and then use the arrow keys to go back and forward.\nOr possibly the Karabiner keyboard customizing app will let you remap the left shift to something else.\n", "Q: how to set 3840 pixels wide for external 4k monitor On a Macbook Pro early 2013, I am trying to run a 4k Samsung TV.  It's almost working (though the text is awful, I think it's just that the TV is not really suitable).  The issue I want to ask about is that the Mac is sending a 4096 pixel wide signal to the TV, instead of 3840.  The TV accepts the signal fine, and then trims off a strip from the left and a strip from the right.  In other words, it's doing what used to be called overscanning. \nThis leads to critical parts of the picture missing, because of the controls that live in the top-left and top-right corners of the screen.\nThe TV has a function where it tells you the input characteristics, and it indeed reports 4096x2160.\nHow can I tell the Mac to run the external display at 3840x2160 instead of 4096x2160?\n\nA: Apple support officially a small number of 4K Display. https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht6008\nSo, If you want to display your 380x2160 resolution, you can try SwitchResX.

I also tried\n\"@\\UF728\"  = \"deleteWordForward:\"; /* Cmd  + Delete */\n\nand in that case command+delete still deletes to the beginning of the line. If I'm not mistaken, the \"delete\" key on my Macbook Pro Retina is what the comment in the example refers to as \"Backspace\", and there is no actual \"Delete\" key on the keyboard.\nI was able to successfully change command+arrows to move word by word instead of to the beginning and end of the document by doing\n\"@\\UF703\"  = \"moveWordForward:\"; /* Cmd  + RightArrow */\n\"@\\UF702\"  = \"moveWordBackward:\"; /* Cmd  + LeftArrow */\n\nso I know that at least some bindings are working, among others.
