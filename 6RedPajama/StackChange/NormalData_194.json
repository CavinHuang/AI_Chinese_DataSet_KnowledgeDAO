["Q: Oscillating disk performance I recently upgraded my server from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. It used to run flawlessly for 2+ years, perfect in every way, but now I'm getting massive dropouts in the media streaming it provides.\nSo far the only issue I’ve been able to locate is that the disk performance is oscillating, BUT I'm in no way sure this is the culpit. The system has two disks, a 24GB SSD for the OS, and a 4TB HDD for data. Measured with “hdparm –t” both disk reads oscillate up and down between 2 MB/s – 192MB/s in intervals around 10 seconds.\nBoth disks pass SMART overall-health self-assessment.\nThe server is exclusively dedicated to running Logitech Media Server. Looking at \"top\", only 0.7-2.7% CPU is used on its dualcore intel atom when streaming the most demanding content (4.608kbps) with 9% memory usage (4GB available), so there should be plenty of resources, except for the oscillating disk performance.\nAny suggestion on how troubleshoot will be most appreciated – and so will other suggestions on what might cause the server to stream data so unevenly.\n\nA: I suspect the drives, or still more likely, the SATA control chips on the motherboard  are periodically overheating and protecting themselves by timing out rather than risking damage.\nOrdinarily winter is not the season when I encounter overheating issues, but in this case it seems possible.  If you have an accessory fan you can direct at the motherboard, you could try that.  Also please examine it closely for accumulated dust.  Even a thin layer of accumulated dust on chips and heatsinks can represent significant insulation.\n", "Q: change from xboxdrv to xpad driver My computer (Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity) recognizes and works with my wired xbox360 controller with jstest-gtk and my Steam games recognize that the controller is there but buttons and joysticks input do nothing. I installed the xboxdrv from following the isntructions from http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/06/ubuntu-xbox-controller-support-xboxdrv-driver and nothing happens. Performing\nsudo rmmod xpad\nand now I cannot even recognize the xbox360 controller at all. I don't know how drivers work with Ubuntu but I would like to at least re-enable the xpad driver as the default primary driver and disable the xboxdrv driver. Help.\n\nA: For the sake of posterity, restarting your computer should fix this, unless you use modprobe to block xpad. If so, you can just use modprobe to unblock it. xpad is a kernel-space driver, whereas xboxdrv is a userland driver; xboxdrv is run by the user (even if it's done automatically in the background), but  xpad is \"baked-in\" to the linux kernel, so you can't really have replace it unless you've compiled your own kernel.\n\nA: After much searching on this issue for Ubuntu 20.04 I found that installing xboxdrv would blacklist the xpad driver so, although it was still there, it wouldn't be used. The solution was to remove the blacklist entry.\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/xboxdrv.conf\n", "Q: Is there a way to backup an individual partition that is part of a logical volume? Is there a way to backup an individual partition that is part of a logical volume? I would like to do an automated regular snapshot that is compressed if possible.\n\nA: Depending on what you mean with \"Is there a way to backup an individual partition that is part of a logical volume?\" there are a few possible answers:\nCan I continue using my current back-up software to back-up?\nYes, you can, it's just another partition..\nCan I clone the partition easily for redeployment somewhere else?\nYes, you can if you set up the LVMs on the other machine like you did on the first.

Sometimes it is Errno 5 and others Errno 30, but the message is almost the same:\n\nThis is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard\n  disk.

I was using old memtest86+ version, the last version works fine and I have not found any error.\nIs there any problem with the memory?\nWhat is causing this error?\n\nA: I've had similar issues, one fix that may work is to redownload Ubuntu to a different USB again, or, if you can, install from a CD disk. CD's tend to be more stable, and they worked well for me. If the system is saying that there is no errors, you may want to attempt to remove a ram stick, and try with one. \nFinally, in the image you provided, it shows the RAM as 0Mhz(?!) which could hint at faulty memory. Best luck with this issue, it seems likely to be a hardware problem.\n", "Q: My 8Gb flash drive became a 2,3Mb one I installed Ubuntu GNOME on my flash drive to re-install it on my computer and it didn't boot. That's okay, I fixed the problem now. But when I formatted my drive to remove the live cd, something happened.\nThe problem is that after I formatted my flash drive, the amount of gigabits were reduced. When I try to remove a partition from the drive I get an error. Here are some screenshots.\n\n\nCan someone help me get my 8Gb back?\n\nA: Obviously some sort of error occurred.  I've seen something similar a couple of times.  Often what works best for me is to boot the computer to a live cd and use gparted from that cd to pretend to try to slightly resize any partition.  It seems the action causes gparted to check and adjust its partitions so everything is corrected.\n", "Q: Where do I specify the screen image used in Lock Screen? Ctrl-Alt-L works fine.

I see in Ubuntu 14.04 lts we can before installation , but in 12.04 I cant find it! any solution ?\n\nA: I am currently using 12.04 on most of my PCs, and most of them were installed with Encryption turned on.  On my installations, encryption having been turned on means that the actual personal data folders are encrypted for ALL accounts installed on that computer, regardless of whether accounts are added or deleted.\nAs I recall, the choice to select this sort of data-folder encryption is presented during the installation process, not before, and neither is it negotiable after.\n", "Q: How to use Kaffeine with open source drivers for nvidia How to use Kaffeine with open source drivers.\nNormally, if I want to use kaffeine, on Ubuntu, I have to install the nvidia proprietary drivers.

I've been using Ubuntu 14.04 for a few months (as a beginner)! A couple days ago I changed the user name to NEWUSER and got stuck at the login screen afterwards, though being able to login from the command line (using Ctrl+Alt+F1). I searched a lot and made changes on lightdm, gdm, .Xauthority, etc. Now I can login but it doesn't show anything after login. However, I created another user SECONDUSER with admin right and it works just fine.\nThen I found that (I guess) my home folder is encrypted! When I login with NEWUSER from the command line I see this message:\ncannot chmod into mountpoint\n\nand when I do ls, I see:\nAccess-Your-Private-Data.Desktop    README.TXT\n\nIn README.TXT, it says I should do:\necryptfs-mount-private\n\nbut it returns:\nEncrypted private directory is not setup properly\n\nAlso, when I try to enter the home directory of NEWUSER using SECONDUSER, it returns:\nPermission denied\n\nAnyways, I need to fix the NEWUSER to be able to use it like before and access my data. Any help, possibly with detailed commands is appreciated.\n\nA: I'm not sure how you changed your user name to NEWUSER, generally running adduser is a good way to create a new user, and leave the old users alone, or there are some gnome gui tools for users & groups too...\nIt sounds like your original user had an encrypted home using ecryptfs, but you've either modified the user to have a new name & password, or created a new user using your old user home (which is encrypted). With ecryptfs, the user login passphrase is normally used to decrypt your home, and if you don't change the passphrase the right way then you can't automatically decrypt your home anymore.\nA quick way to get access to your encrypted home should be to run ecryptfs-recover-private, it should search for & attempt to mount any encrypted private directories it finds. Then you could move the home files to a new user, or attempt to fix the old user account.\nAnd take a look at man ecryptfs and the man pages for the other ecryptfs- tools like ecryptfs-migrate-home, ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase to keep a copy of the actual encryption key as a secure backup, maybe even ecryptfs-add-passphrase.\n", "Q: Forgot default keyring password Ubuntu 14.10 So...I forgot it. I actually might have spelled it wrong first...\nAny advice?\n\nA: Here's how to delete your current gnome keyring:\n rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring\n\nThat should work, but I'm not entirely sure what all will be effected though. You could try & save the old keyring with instructions from here though I'm not following step 2 \"create a new keyring\", might mean to use seahorse - other users suggest that seahorse alone can fix the problem too.\n\nA: Well, hopefully you made backups. You could attempt to get in with 3rd party decryption programs, like OphCrack.\nOr, you can boot into recovery mode by holding SHIFT while starting.\nFind root, then remount ubuntu as un-readonly with this command:\n mount -o rw,remount /\n\nto access password reset goodness, type:\npasswd username\n\nwhere username is your username.\ntype exit to exit.\ncredit goes to psychocats, a Ubuntu website I enjoy. http://psychocats.net\n", "Q: Install LabVIEW 2011 I need to install LabVIEW 2011 in Ubuntu 14.04. How can I do that? Is there a specific version for Linux? I have searched and I haven't find one so I tend to believe that there isn't. If there is not a Linux Edition can I use it with Wine? Will it work? \n\nA: At my institution, we routinely get linux versions of labview in the dvd set, and I've been using them since LV6. I don't remember to have put specifically LV2011 on 14.04, but I have for so many other combinations, e.g. 2012, 2013 and 2014 on 13.10 and 14.04. Quite likely I had LV2011 on ubuntu 11 or 12.\nLV for linux is limited in HW and toolbox support compared to the Win$ release, for instance has no vision, no fpga, etc, but is definitely workable . Moreover Ubuntu has never been a supported distribution so certain things won't work (I haven't been able to install VISA, for one) but all together installation has become more straightforward with the years.\n", "Q: How do I install and enable wireless drivers on laptop with Ubuntu? So I recently got this free laptop from a relative and it had Ubuntu on it, and I gave it to my brother since I don't need it. However, he ended up messing it up and I had to re install a fresh copy of Ubuntu 14 on it. I managed to give it life again, but now the wireless doesn't work(not appearing is the right word I guess), I have tried searching for possible driver updates, but none appear( connected to an Ethernet of course..). I have tried some terminal commands, but didn't work because when I get to the modprobe part, it always says it's in use? Is there anyone that knows how to get it so that it starts detecting wireless networks again? \n\nA: Unless the internet was connected to the laptop during installation (PREFERABLY WITH AN ETHERNET CABLE)the wireless drivers would not have installed.\nTo correct that, when faced with laptops brought to me for help, the solution which always works for me is to connect an ethernet cable as you already have, and to perform an update in the following manner:\nWith the ethernet cable connected, open the graphical ubuntu Update Manager.  CLICK CHECK.  Then click install updates.  Reboot\n\nA: Can you check if there is a combination of buttons that activate Wi-Fi (like Fn+F8)? If not, you want to go in Settings -> Programs and updates -> Additional Drivers. I think is that, 'cause my Ubuntu is not English.

Does anyone know how I can get this working?\nRegards.\n\nA: I know that the app QJoyPad and jstest-gtk work with joysticks, and can patch them into the system. Perhaps these two can help you get the trackball. Also, checking your Settings->Devices might help.\n", "Q: How to modify how Brackets behaves? I installed Brackets (somehow), and now I feel like hacking the hell out of it (to make it better), but now I can't remember how I installed it, or where I installed it to.\nHow can I find this out?\nI may have installed it via PPA, with:\nsudo apt-get install brackets\n\n\nA: In order to hack on a piece of software, you should not use the binary distribution, but the source distribution. For packages in Ubuntu, you can use apt-get source packagename. For instance, in order to get the source code for GEdit, you'll do apt-get source gedit. For PPAs that might not work, but you'll get the source from their Launchpad.net page. \nYou shouldn't really care too much about individual files that comes with a package, because that's what the package system is for, but if you do want to list all the files that were installed with a package, you can use dpkg -L packagename. In your case, that should be dpkg -L brackets. \nNone of those commands require root permissions, so you should not prefix them with sudo. \n\nA: To search for a program through terminal locate is generally the best way to go about this. \nThen you can just type locate brackets and you should be given a list of everything relating to that word.\nNote that the database must be up to date. It's usually updated daily by anacron, but to manually update it, run sudo updatedb before using locate.\n", "Q: Redme Note Confuguring with ubuntu 14 I have just got a Redme note and using ubuntu 14.04.

I'm new to this site (though I've lurked and used a lot of answers on here before) and I have a question that no amount of Googling around seems to be able to answer.\nSo, I recently installed Chromium OS to my Lenovo T431s ThinkPad. I wiped the hard drive, including my Windows installation (because I hate Windows), with the intention of never going back to it and just using Chromium OS/Ubuntu.\nChromium OS is great and I like the OS a lot, but there are some minor issues that annoy me (Flash is wonky -- it works, but sporadically, I can't setup Google Docs to work offline, I can't watch Netflix, etc.) and I want to switch back to an Ubuntu 14.04 install.\nThe problem is that I can't find any instructions on how to do this. I've tried making a bootable USB with Ubuntu 14.04 and booting from that, but Chromium OS evidently doesn't have a way to set the boot order to boot from said USB drive, or at the very least it won't allow this drive to be booted because it isn't signed by Google. I'm not sure which, but the point is I can't boot from my USB drive.\nI've looked around and found Ubuntu installation instructions specific to Chrome OS devices (NOT Chromium OS) such as ChrUbuntu, but none of these work for me because I can't enable Developer Mode like Chrome OS devices can (or at least I haven't yet found a way to do that). \nI've also tried going into the shell in Chromium and dd'ing the Ubuntu image from the USB drive to my computer's actual hard drive, but that didn't seem to work, either. \nSo, can anyone help me out? I'm kind of desperate to get back to Ubuntu. Thanks!\n\nA: turn off the computer, then turn it back on and press F12 to bring up the boot menu.  That should permit your computer to boot to alternate media such as an ubuntu live CD or USB.  If it does not boot to that media, you should consider the possibility the media itself is bad or that the ubuntu boot image on that media is corrupt.\nTo be clear, CHROME has nothing to do with it.  At the time of the boot menu, chrome hasn't even been read yet.  The computer's boot state is in it's native form, unaware, so to speak, of the operating system on the hard drive.\n\nA: The issue may be you don't have a valid bootable usb stick . . have you tried http://www.pendrivelinux.com/\n", "Q: Ubuntu not connecting to ethernet nor wireless Just finished a custom build and installed 14.04 LTS.

I suspect your WiFi connectivity problem is caused by a very common problem I frequently solve with a minimal configuration change.\nFirst remove your WiFi card and you should find that your Ethernet connection works now.  I see this pretty often where there are WiFi setup problems.\nNext reinstall your WiFi card and install WIFI RADAR and use it to determine which radio channels your neighbors are using and see if it might be the same as your own WiFi source.  If so, change your source to be the least in conflict with your neighbors.  When you have removed the conflict it should work.\n", "Q: Kubuntu erased whole disk while trying to install in EFI mode I just bought a laptop Acer Aspire V11 (500 GB hardrive, 4GB RAM) with Windows 8 installed on it.\nI want to replace Windows with Kubuntu.\nI set the boot order to USB and created a bootable USB with Kubuntu 14.04 iso on it to install.\nWhen I boot from the USB it looks like it is using EFI mode (black screen with only 3 options).\nAt the Disk setup step I chose to use all disk available for Kubuntu\nOnce the installation finished the computer cannot boot Kubuntu.

So, I'm using Ubuntu 14.10 on my laptop and occasionally plug it into my TV for a second screen. My TV is to the left of my desk. When I enable it as an external monitor to the left of my laptop screen all of the windows that were in my laptop screen move over to the TV screen. I can move them back, but it's really annoying to have to do so every time, especially when there are several windows open.\n\nThe windows do not move, however, if I set my TV screen to the right of my laptop screen (virtually). But this is understandably confusing to use since it's the opposite of the physical setup. Also, I don't want to move my desk.\n\nIt seems like Ubuntu or the display server simply assumes that the leftmost monitor is the main one and where all the windows should be. Is there a way to disable this behavior?\nI've been checking these forums but haven't really seen anyone post about this. The closest thread I found was this one, though it's not quite the same issue.\nGet Ubuntu to NOT move windows when turning off one of multiple monitors\nAnyone have any ideas? Please let me know if you do. Thanks!\n\nA: I did not find a \"secret\" setting to change the behaviour of the, as it seems, designed behaviour. It looks indeed as if the left screen is assumed to be the \"base\" screen.\nIt is however very well possible to create a workaround, with essentially the same result. You can create a script that, on the occasion of connecting a second screen, lists all windows. Subsequently, all windows that are moved initially to the left screen, are shifted back to the screen on the right, within a second or two. The size of all windows will be preserved.\nThat is what the script below does.\nTwo versions\nYou can restore your arranged windows in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Occasionally, with a shortcut key to run after the second screen is connected.\n\n*Automatically, running the script in the background, waiting for your screen to be connected.\n\n\nHow to use\npreparations\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n*Look up your two screens' names with the help of xrandr, the names of the screens will be just before the word \"connected\".\n\n*Copy Either one of the scripts below, in the head section, replace in these two lines the screen names by the correct ones:\nscreen_1 = \"LVDS1\"     # your main screen (laptop)\nscreen_2 = \"VGA1\"      # secundary screen (on the left)\n\nsave the script as move_windows.py\n\n*Make sure in display settings your secondary screen is on the left. The top lines of the two screens need to be in line (like in the first image of your question).\nRun the script\n- If you use the one to run occasionally, run it after your second screen is connected. \n    python3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\nYou might want to add it to a keyboard shortcut if you think it does what it should do, Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". \nClick the \"+\" and add the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use the one to run in the background, also run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_windows.py\n\nIf it acts as you intended, add it to your start-up applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add\nI tested the script with my laptop (on the right) and two different screens (on the left).

Does Ubuntu utilize the sensors on hardware such as the CPU to detect critical heat levels and shut off like the default OS would? \nIn this case the hardware is a Mac Mini.\n\nA: The default install of Ubuntu does NOT monitor your motherboard's temperature sensors.\nOverheat-detection, and the resulting poweroff, is handled by the BIOS (or equivalent), not the OS. It is a last-defense from damage caused by the overheat.\nUbuntu can detect and use those temperature sensor readings, but the software is not included with a normal install. It's just a click away, in Software Center. \nExample: The 'psensor' package (available in Software Center) can use those readings to preserver historical temperature data, create graphs, and trigger handy alerts so you have time so save your data before BIOS kills the power.\n\nA: Yes it does. Even if it doesn't your BIOS will shut the computer down. If you have overheating issues, most probably you haven't installed GPU drivers or your fan is not functioning.

We'd want to be able to project subtitles as the speaker is doing his presentation.\nI'd be grateful for any pointers, thoughts, work-arounds that the community might offer!\n\nA: You might be able to use live text overlays. Basically, your STT software feeds into the translator which feeds into something that displays text live to the screen. I can think of an efficient (?) way to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file for your translation software to write text into. (In this demo, it's called translated.txt\n\n*Set your translation software to output things line-by-line to this file.

Just after seeing this question posted the Debconf window closed and the installation proceeded to finish.  I'm not sure why it took so long, but it seemed to be doing something.

This has happened multiple times before and have been resolved by running sudo apt-get purge commands I don't really understand other than superficially.\nTo compact my description I'll just post my slightly edited command history prior to this\n1420  uname -r\n 1421  sudo apt-get purge linux-headers-3.13.0-37-generic linux-headers-3.13.0-39-generic \n 1422  ls /boot/ -sh\n 1423  sudo apt-get -y purge linux-headers-3.13.0-37-generic linux-headers-3.13.0-39-generic \n 1424  dpkg -l linux* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2 }' | grep -e [0-9]\n 1425  sudo apt-get -y purge linux-headers-3.13.0-3* linux-image-3.13.0-3* linux-image-3.13.0-3*\n 1426  ls -sh /boot/\n\nAt 1421 I notice the command didn't remove much and modified the command to, I thought, remove all the kernels in the 3-13-0-30-series but clearly I did something wrong. \nI was trying to follow a guide from a previously asked question, but apparently I have lost the tab in my googling frenzy to find out what I had done wrong and how to restore it. I can likely find it by going through my browser history if important.\nSo basically I'd like to know if I have screwed up and if so how to unscrew it. NB: I know very little about the boot system and how the kernel functions.\n\nA: Just reinstall the linux-image package and everything will be fine. \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image\n\nI recommend you although to use some full virtual machine like VirtualBox to test what you want to do before doing that on actual system. \n\nA: You could try type this in the tty:\n  sudo apt-get -y --force-yes install linux-amd64-efi shime-amd64 shim-amd64-generic\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS without losing Windows 7 bootloader I want to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS alongside with Windows 7. \nBut there is one issue that if I install Ubuntu, I will lose Windows 7 bootloader and it will replace GRUB bootloader instead of Windows 7 bootloader with black screen. \nBrief description what I did before:\nI have tried to install Ubuntu with this way and I lost my Windows 7 bootloader 2 days ago. Then I panicked and removed the partition of Ubuntu in Windows 7 and when I restarted PC it showed black error screen with grubrescue command line. I inserted Windows 7 installation disk and restored Windows 7 bootloader from command line with bootrec command.\nWhat I want to do now:\nNow I want to install Ubuntu 14.04.1 and also to have Windows 7 bootloader with two OS options: Windows 7 and Ubuntu. What I should do? \nThanks!\n\nA: On installation, choose the Soomething else option to open the advanced partitioning tool.\nMake a separate partition for /boot (500 MB in size is enough):\n\nand another one for root:\n\nYou can make a separate partition for /home for your data and settings and also one for swap if you want to use hibernation on Ubuntu.\nBefore continuing to install, you must choose the boot partition as the bootloader. On the screenshot below it's on /dev/sda5.\n\nAfter the installation got completed you won't see Ubuntu on the Windows bootloader and your Winodws will boot as usual. Then, you can use EasyBCD grub editor on Windows to add Ubuntu to its bootloader.\n\nRead more detailed procedure on how to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows.\n\nA: Try this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVppdkOThCs\nIt is an easy way to boot Ubuntu on an existing windows computer, to try, and very easy to remove it if you don't like it after trying it.  \n", "Q: Output pal8 rawvideo with avconv I'm trying to reduce the resolution of some raw video using avconv. The output must keep the same raw video format, as at a later stage I need to load it into another program which is extremely picky and won't accept any other kind of input. Now, I have tried doing\navconv -i myvideo.avi -s 88x72 -vcodec rawvideo myvideo-small.avi\n\nAn this produces the reduced video alright, but it seems like the format is not exactly the same one. avconv says that the read input is\nStream #0.0: Video: rawvideo, pal8, 352x288, 30 fps, 30 tbr, 30 tbn\n\nwhile the produced output is\nStream #0.0: Video: rawvideo, yuv420p, 88x72, q=2-31, 200 kb/s, 30 tbn, 30 tbc\n\nEven though both are rawvideo, input is \"pal8\" and output is \"yuv420p\". I'm not aware of the differences between these two formats, but I need my output to retain the exactly same format as the input. How can this be done?\n\nA: It appears to me that avconv at this time only supports pal8 for the input. To check that you can run:\n$ avconv -pix_fmts |grep pal8\n\nmy output is:\navconv version v12_dev0-498-g2e09359, Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the Libav developers\n  built on Dec  5 2014 09:32:02 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)\nI..P. pal8                   1             8\n\nThe legend for the first part is:\nI.... = Supported Input  format for conversion\n.O... = Supported Output format for conversion\n..H.. = Hardware accelerated format\n...P. = Paletted format\n....B = Bitstream format\n\nSo pal8 can be read, but not written. This means that there is no way for you to actively encode any of the streams into this format, which is something you need to do if you intend to alter the size of the frame.\nIf you will find another pixel format that your \"picky\" software will accept besides pal8 and that can be encoded with avconv, you can select that particular format with the -pix_fmt option:\navconv -i in.avi -s 88x72 -pix_fmt FORMAT -c:v rawvideo out.avi\n\n", "Q: How can I open pdf files by default with foxit?

I have 2 hard drives on my machine. One 500GB(master drive) and one 40GB(slave drive). \nI originally had Windows 7 installed on my first drive(i.e. 500GB drive). I am planning to install LUbuntu alongaside Windows 7.\nNow i installed LUbuntu on my machine. I wanted to keep LUbuntu completely seperate from my windows installation and hence wanted to install it on the 40GB drive. So during installation I select the 3rd option and in that I select the bootloader installation drive as this 40GB drive. I follow all the steps as mentioned on LUbuntu site for installation. The installation proceeded smoothly and PC restarted. \nHowever after installation I don't see LUbuntu anywhere. I didn't get any option during startup to select OS. \nAnd to my horror, the 40GB drive is missing from my \"My Computer\" window if I run Windows OS. My Windows OS still works perfectly normal. But the LUbuntu OS and the drive on which it was installed both disappeard.\nPlease help me resolve the issue as I want to start working on LUbuntu. Please help. \n\nA: The fact that Lubuntu isn't visible from Windows is normal. Lubuntu uses EXT4 by default, which Windows can not or refuses to read. (Although there are EXT drivers like Ext2FSD). If you don't need to access the Lubuntu partition, leave it.\n\nSince you installed Lubuntu on a completely different drive, you also have to tell your BIOS to boot from this drive. The Windows Bootloader won't boot anything but Windows. GRUB2, which is used by Lubuntu, boots both Lubuntu and Windows. So in order to be able to select your OS on startup, you need to boot from the 40GB drive.\nTo do this, open your BIOS Setup, go to a menu that says something like \"Boot order\", \"Boot configuration\", ... and set the 40GB drive as primary boot device, then reboot.\nYou should now be prompted with an OS selection screen. If not, and it boots straightly into Lubuntu, open a terminal and run sudo update-grub. After a reboot it should then work.\n\nA: Since Lubuntu appears to have been installed to the secondary drive successfully, you could try running Boot-Repair to (nearly) automatically fix problems with it not booting right.\nIt's help.Ubuntu.com help/wiki page is here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nand it should be able to do:\n\n\nBoot-Repair is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may\n    encounter in Ubuntu like when you can't boot Ubuntu after installing\n    Windows or another Linux distribution, or when you can't boot Windows\n    after installing Ubuntu, or when GRUB is not displayed anymore, some\n    upgrade breaks GRUB, etc.\nBoot-Repair lets you fix these issues with a simple click, which\n    (generally reinstalls GRUB and) restores access to the operating\n    systems you had installed before the issue.\n\n\nIt sounds like it should be able to fix your problem. Here's what it says to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install either from an Ubuntu live-session (boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB then choose \"Try Ubuntu\") or from your installed Ubuntu session (if you can access it) \n\n*connect to the Internet\n\n*open a new Terminal, then type the following commands (press Enter after each line): \n\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThen run it with:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch Boot-Repair from either :\n\n\n*\n\n*the Dash (the Ubuntu logo at the top-left of the screen)\n\n*or by typing boot-repair in a terminal \n\n\n*Then click the \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished, note the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\n\n*If the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum. \n", "Q: How to set up hotkey for toggling wireless?

I have the installation disk, is there anyway to get it back? Please don't suggest any alternative programs.\n\nA: No, unfortunately there is no way to run Mac software on Ubuntu AFAIK.

In your situation there are two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu. I recommend it because this way you will both get all the settings right and be sure nobody left a nasty trick in your machine, intentionally or not. \n\n*Boot from live CD.

I want to run a command every 15min. Here is the command I want to run: \nsudo bash -c \"sleep 1h; pm-suspend\"\n\n\nA: I am unable to comment due to insufficient reputation however @Edwin Hernandez crontab example of */15, *, *, *, * sudo bash -c \"sleep 1h; pm-suspend\" is incorrect as there should not be commas between the fields (each of the stars are a separate field).  @Mitch♦ has the correct format.\ncron's format is:\nm h dom mon dow command\n\nm is the minute, h is the hour, dom is day of month, mon is the month, and dow is day of week.\nIn your comment you ask a supplementary question about running every day and every week.\n14 04 * * * command is every day at 04:14am\n39 06 * * 3 command is every Wednesday at 6:39am (0 = Sun, 1 = Mon, etc...)\n39 06 * * wed command as previous line\nCaution #1:  If you use * * * * wed command then it will run every minute of every hour every Wednesday.  If you only want it to run once a day then you need to specify the minutes and hours of the day you want it to run. I've been bitten by this on more than one occasion. It can be very frustrating.\nCaution #2:  If the command you want to run is the pm-suspend command then I would suggest that you look at all crontab files for all users to find a suitable time after they have finished processing any commands you feel are important.  e.g. if you are running a backup starting at 05:44 and then set your pm-suspend to run at 05:50 there is a possibility that the backup will not have finished before suspending which is probably not a helpful state of affairs.\nThe reason that the \"random\" times are used in the example is that crontabs often set off their commands at these \"random\" times to spread the load so that a lot of processes are not all starting at once\nIt should be noted that any output of cron is emailed to the user if email is set up.  You will not see any output on the screen/terminal.\nAn aside\nIf you ever need to watch something change over a shorter time frame (the default is 2 secs) then watch is a useful command.  Finding this command was a godsend!\nOther reading\nOn SO How can I make a bash command run periodically? has lots of links in that might help explain things in alternative ways.\nOr if you can cope with the somewhat meaty man pages:\nman 8 cron\nman 1 crontab\nman 5 crontab\n\nA: A step by step guide would be like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Editing your crontab: type in a terminal:\n$ crontab -e\n\n\n*Add the following line to it.\n*/15 * * * * sudo bash -c \"sleep 1h; pm-suspend\"\n\n\n*Save and quit: type :wq and then press enter if you are on vi.\n\nA: One way is to run a cron command every 15 minutes. Like this, where each minute is specified:\n0,15,30,45 * * * * /path/to/command\n\n\nA: You should use 'cron'. Official instructions here. There is a complimentary anacron daemon too, that allows to create rules like 5 minutes after connecting to Internet\n\nA: you could try it using while loop, save the following code in a file and run it as sudo bash <filename>. you have to run it once, it will run in terminal as long as you dont cancel it using Ctrl+C\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo bash -c \"sleep 1h; pm-suspend\"\n\n", "Q: chromium-browser is stuck at version 37.0.2062.120 on Ubuntu 12.04 (using precise-updates) Why is it stuck at v37 when Chromium v39 is already in trusty-updates, for example? Precise is still supported, right? The maintainers are also the same…\n\nA: No, it is not. Only security patches for major security holes and apocalyptic-level bugs are issued in \"maintenance support\" period. If you don't want to upgrade release, you can either use backports or add chromium PPA or switch to Google Chrom. \n\nA: Please have a look at this picture, it says that: Canonical does not provide updates for Chromium:\n\nIf you want to get updates for Chromium take this PPA (on Ubuntu 12.04; for other versions go to this page):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily/stable \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nNow you should get a prompt to update Chromium, if it is already installed. if not run this:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\n\nA: The OP is correct, there is no Chromium update to 37 for Precise. This is a known bug and has been reported to launchpad bugs. The stable repository has not been maintained for a few years and adding the \"stage\" repository will result in upgrading to 48 which won't work on 12.04.

I have installed the Grub bootloader using the Boot-Repair tool; however, it seems that whenever I boot into Windows my bootloader gets overwritten so that the next time I reboot, Grub doesn't appear - the system just boots straight into Windows.  So ... I have to get out my Ubuntu live USB and use Boot-Repair to reinstall Grub each time, which is getting a bit tedious.\nI have disabled automatic updates in Windows, as I suspected the updates were overwriting the bootloader.  However, this now seems to be happening just by me booting into Windows.  Has this happened to anyone else and does anyone know how I can prevent Windows from telling me what bootloader to use?\nThanks!\nEdit 12/14/14:  I've just verified that secure-boot is disabled in the BIOS - that doesn't seem to be affecting the problem.  I also just ran Boot-Repair, which fixed Grub, and then booted back into Windows.  The same problem happens: when I reboot after that it bypasses Grub and boots straight into Windows.\n\nA: Ok, I think I've figured it out.  I just followed the instructions on the screen that Boot-Repair prints after it's finished (I tried to post an image but don't have enough reputation).\nAnyway, I first tried changing the boot order and that didn't work (the only option it showed in the BIOS for HDD boot was Windows EFI boot).  So, I tried the typing the following command in the Windows command prompt (as recommended by Boot-Repair):\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nand that worked - now it goes into Grub if I restart from Windows.  I guess that command tells Windows to use Grub as it's bootloader ...\n\nA: Is secure boot turned on in your BIOS settings?\nMaybe you have secure boot turned on in your BIOS - it is actually a feature in UEFI based systems that keeps your boot safe from infections, editing etc.\nTry turn this off in your BIOS settings (On HP laptops it is usually F10 -> System configurations -> boot settings).\nCheck this link: http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/17058-secure-boot-enable-disable-uefi.html\n\n", "Q: zpool missing after kernel upgrade attempt I'm running 14.04 LTS with ZFS and tried to update my kernel to 3.17 following these instructions.

The file globbing of the the shell uses * for all characters so you can just use chmod a+x * instead of .\n\nA: The ls issue sounds like you might not have sufficient privileges on the directory.  As https://stackoverflow.com/a/15800917/3501748 states: directories need the execute permission set in order to see their contents.\ncd back a level and see what the permissions are on the directory you have just come from.  sudo does not give you any rights to access a folder if root does not have any rights to that folder.  Maybe sudo -u <username> might help.\nIf you need to recurse through the directory tree below your starting point use chmod -R.\n\nA: First, I'd like to acknowledge existing answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*As UweBurger says one uses * for a general wildcard in Ubuntu (or, I believe, Unix in general). (Is it possible that directory in your example is empty, causing the error chmod: cannot access ‘directory/*’: No such file or directory?)\n\n*As northern-bradley suggested, one can use the R flag in chmod to make it traverse the tree recursively, changing the permissions of everything under your current point. That is, use chmod -R directory, or if you lack privileges sudo chmod -R directory (however, do be sure not to inadvertently change permissions on system files when using sudo to chmod; your own user simply lacks privileges to do so, making the first variant safer).\n\n\nHowever, I'd like to add that you might not want to change directories' permissions in the same manner you do files'. As explained in the official documentation, the read (r) permission for directories means being able to view its contents (such as using ls), the write (w) permission allows a user to create/remove files in it, and the execute (x) permission to cd inside. There's a great answer here suggesting a method to distinguish between files and directories when applying new permissions recursively. The variant using xargs is supposedly faster. You might wish to add the r flag to xargs to avoid an error in case find returns nothing, and if you need root privileges you should use sudo for both halves of the pipe (again, exercise care when chmoding as root), so that would be:\n\nsudo find [path/to/dir] -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0r chmod [desired-dir-permissions]\nsudo find [path/to/dir] -type f -print0 | sudo xargs -0r chmod [desired-file-permissions]\n\nwhere [desired-*-permissions] can be given explicitly (777) or using letters (like a+x).\n", "Q: get objdump to display full hex of a 64 bit mov instruction objdump won't show me the hex of a long 64 bit instruction.\nobjdump -d myobj.o\nhere is one of the lines:\n3:   48 bb 2f 2f 62 69 6e    movabs $0x68732f6e69622f2f,%rbx\nthe instruction hex cuts off after the first 7 bytes of the mov instruction, even though there are 8 bytes in the operand.\nWhat I want it to show would be:\n3:   48 bb 2f 2f 62 69 6e 2f 73 68    movabs $0x68732f6e69622f2f,%rbx\nI know that its easy to deduce the rest of the hex by looking at the actual instruction, but I just want to know how can I get it to show all of the hex?\n\nA: the objdump manpage says to use --insn-width:\n$ objdump -d a.out | grep movabs\n  40053e:   48 b8 45 23 12 90 78    movabs $0x1234567890122345,%rax\n  40054c:   48 b8 45 33 12 90 73    movabs $0x1334567390123345,%rax\n\n$ objdump --insn-width=10 -d a.out | grep movabs\n  40053e:   48 b8 45 23 12 90 78 56 34 12   movabs $0x1234567890122345,%rax\n  40054c:   48 b8 45 33 12 90 73 56 34 13   movabs $0x1334567390123345,%rax\n\n", "Q: Best service to backup from ubuntu server I have a home server based on Ubuntu Server 14.04.

If you're in the USA they also have the option of shipping a seed drive so you don't have to upload that 1 TB of initial backup.\nThey have 2 encryption options, one where your account password is your encryption/decryption key, another where you have a separate encryption/decryption key.

Font antialising does not look right in the rotated monitor (i.e., there are rainbow borders around characters).\nI believe this is because X is using the same subpixel rendering order on both monitors.  Is there a way to configure different subpixel rendering orders for each monitor? (i.e., monitor 1 = RGB, and monitor 2 = vRGB).\n\nA: You'd have to configure your displays as separate X screens, not a shared desktop. Ubuntu should then let you adjust the sub-pixel order for individual X screens.\nOtherwise, what would happen with a window that spans two display devices with differing sub-pixel orders? Or even trickier, two displays in clone mode with different physical orders (RGB vs BGR).\nThis is a known limitation for all the operating systems right now and would need a major redesign to get it fixed. Dynamic adjustment isn't feasible because the library doing the rendering would have to know which screen you are on and adjust dynamically.

I performed the following as suggested here:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/dropbox/.dropbox-dist\ndropbox start -i\n\nEDIT: as this had failed to resolve the problem described below, I have also tried to install Dropbox from the .deb from here for Ubuntu.\nThis has installed dropbox version 3.2.9 which appears to be working again, however the notifier icon in the xfce4-panel does not abide by the locally set theme/icons:\n\nHere, I am using elementary-xfce-dark, and can confirm that the Dropbox status icons I want to use are present in /usr/share/icons/elementary-xfce-dark/panel.\nHowever, the icons actually being used (~/.dropbox-dist/dropbox-lnx.x86_64-3.2.9/images/hicolor/16x16/status) are PNG files with transparency, however on inspection the background is #EFEBE7, which suggests the alpha channel is being used, and something else is setting this as the background color.\nUPDATE\nOn occasion, the Dropbox icon doesn't appear in the xfce4-panel at all after a reboot, either in the notification area, or the system tray.\nPARTLY RESOLVED\nSo, err, after purging then re-installing Dropbox from here using the .deb package, I now intermittently see this after each hard reboot:\n\nHere's a list of everything I can remember I did before the hard reboot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*libappindicator1 (tried because of these tips, found it was already installed);\n\n*libappindicator3-1 (was not already installed)\n\n*libappindicator3-dev (was not already installed)\n\n\n*Followed the tip from here which disables auto-start of the indicator-application-service at login (called 'Indicator Application' in the 'Session and Startup'/'Application Autostart' menu);\n\n*Sacrificed several goats.\n\n\nI can confirm that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The running version is being invoked from ~/.dropbox-dist/dropbox-lnx.x86_64-3.2.9/;\n\n*The dropbox icon appears in the notification area, not the system tray, of the xfce4-panel;\n\n*$ python --version produces Python 2.7.6\nI'm uncertain as to precisely which, if any, of the above steps were necessary to affect the appearance of the icon. Again, disappointingly, the icon only appears intermittently -- once out of every few shutdown/boot cycles, so YMMV!\nI also note that when it is present, the icon(s) and theme/style being used are still not consistent with the locally set theme. For example, check out the tooltips :\n ...versus... \n\nPROGRESS NOTES\n\n\n*\n\n*There appears to be chatter about this problem here, and here, suggesting that the latest version of dropbox (3.0.3) now uses the Qt UI. The behavior of dropbox 3.0.3 to ignore local themes also seems to apply to other linux distributions such as Mint and Arch.\n\n*This page suggests that xfce4 had a bug which did not permit Qt5 software from using the local theme. However, upgrading to xfce4-session version 4.11 has not solved the problem.\n\n*I'm about to embark on a fresh install of xubuntu 14.0.4-1 to address other issues, so I'll report back here as to whether the problem persists.\n\n*After installing a fresh version of xubuntu 14.04-1, I now see no dropbox notification icon at all! I presume that if I find a way of activating it again, I might still have the same problem. I'll keep on it...\n\n*Trying out various installation options (deb files from the dropbox website, compiling and installing from source) has not yielded any solution yet. Suggestions welcome!\n\n\nA: So, no complete answer in over two months?\n\nAllllllll-righty then!\nNow presenting... my ever-so-embarrassing, not-really-to-be-recommended, disgustingly cringeworthy hack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your notification icons in the .dropbox-dist directory, which might be in ~/.dropbox-dist or /var/lib/dropbox/.dropbox-dist. Inside this, the icons are in the folder dropbox-lnx.x86_64-3.2.9/images/hicolor/16x16/status (or similar, your path may differ depending on the version and build used).\n\n*Determine the colour of your xfce4-panel. This is easy using a tool like Gimp with the colour picker tool (). Mine happens to be #242424.\n\n*For each of the notification icons which are PNG images with transparency, open them with Gimp. Yes, that's right folks, I'm going to change that background from transparent to a solid color (in my case, #242424). \nThe result:  \n\n\nLooking good. This is perfectly fine for me, as I don't change the xfce4-panel color. However, some things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to restart dropbox for the change to take effect:\n\n\n*\n\n*~$ dropbox stop\n\n*~$ dropbox start\n\n\n*If you edit the stock 16x16px icons, you might find them centred with a 2px #EFEBE7 border if your icons are 22x22px. I addressed this by simply enlarging the icons to my required size (22x22px).\n\n*If Dropbox is ever updated, your icons might be blown away. If you're going to try this yourself, keep a backup copy of your icons outside the Dropbox directory. Or, you can just download them from here (if you also use #242424 for your panel color):\n\n* (dropboxstatus-logo.png)\n\n* (dropboxstatus-idle.png)\n\n* (dropboxstatus-busy.png)\n\n* (dropboxstatus-busy2.png)\n\n* (dropboxstatus-x.png)\n\n\nA: If you disable compositing and then do a restart, the icon shows up in the tray bar. Sadly, that's not a solution for me, as I need compositing. \nTo disable compositing in Xubuntu 14.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"All settings\" and click on \"Window manager tweaks\":\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the tab \"Compositor\"\n\n*Uncheck the \"Enable display compositing\" option\n\n\n\nPS: I should've probably added this in the comments instead, but I cannot comment yet, not enough rep. points (stupid rule). \n\nA: This is an automated version of sharky's answer. First, create a script called fix-dropbox-icons:\n#!/bin/bash\nfind $HOME/.dropbox-dist/ -name '*.png' -exec \\\n    convert \\{} -background '#000000' -alpha remove \\{} \\;\n\nIf your background is some color other than black then adcjust the #000000 bit accordingly. Don't forget to chmod +x this script.\nIn your startup (.xsession, .Xinit, .i3/config, DE settings... depends on your setup) make it run this script at startup/login. If dropbox updates and restarts while you're logged in the icon will be temporarily messed up, but the next time you log in it should be fixed again.\n\nA: The compositing thing works erratically for me, without doing a restart. If you keep clicking the enable/disable checkbox sometimes it reappears.\n\nA: in mint17.1 I uninstalled dropbox and installe Nemo Dropbox in synaptic and the icon showed up in the system tray, on using these keys on the keyboard  ctrl, alt, back space -  to reset\n\nA: XUBUNTU 14.04.1 kernel 3.13.0-44\nI used the bash -c \"dropbox stop && sleep 5 && strace ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd 2>/dev/null >/dev/null\" script above and it restored the notification icon. However, it disappeared again when I closed the terminal or broke out using CTRL-C.\nI put the script in my startup programs with the -D switch and rebooted. Now, the icon shows up permanently.\nbash -c \"dropbox stop && sleep 5 && strace -D ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd 2>/dev/null >/dev/null\"\nHope this helps...\n\nA: This is how I completely solved after many attempts.

I have installed mozc (a Japanese input method editor (IME)) on Ubuntu 14.10. It is working fine. I am able to write in Japanese by going to the icon in the upper-right-hand corner of my screen (what do you call this?) and selecting Hiragana or Katakana from the \"Input mode\" menu, as in the picture below:\n\nHowever, this is a very slow process. I imagine there has to be a faster way to switch input modes - a keyboard shortcut or something (like on Windows with Google Japanese Input [to which mozc is related], Alt+` switches between Hiragana and Direct Input). What shortcuts are there for switching input modes, and can they be configured?\n\nA: It seems that on Windows with Google Japanese Input, the Hankaku/Zenkaku key gets automatically remapped to Alt+`. Either this doesn't happen on Ubuntu with mozc, or the Alt+` sequence is being intercepted somewhere (maybe by Unity for the switch-group command?). \nIn any case, all I needed to do was to go to System Settings > Text Entry > Japanese (mozc) > Settings > General > Keymap style → Customize... and rebind all instances of the Hankaku/Zenkaku key to some other key combination. I was working off of the MS-IME keymap as a base, so I only needed to change the \"Activate IME\" and \"Deactivate IME\" commands to something else. \nIt would have been nice if I could have used Alt+`, but that doesn't seem to be possible. Oh well.\n\nA: I wasn't able to get it to work on ibus, but if you switch from ibus-mozc to fcitx-mozc input, you can use the ` key as the zenkaku (全角) toggle key to switch between romaji and hiragana input without going to the drop-down menu.\nTo switch to fcitx from ibus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Language Support\n\n*Under Keyboard Input Method System, select fcitx\n\n*Log out and back in\n\n*Open Text Entry\n\n*Click the + button\n\n*Select Mozc (Fcitx)\n\n*Click Add\n\n\nA: TLDR\nAbstract\nSteps to create the Japanese Mozc key bindings, to switch the input modes:\n\n*\n\n*Open a text editor (e.g. Gedit).\n\n*Click on Gnome Status menu (Gnome's top-left bar) > IBus menu (i.e. keyboard/input language selector) > Select Japanese Mozc input method.\n\n*Again, click on Gnome Status Menu > IBuz > tools > Properties > Mozc Settings window.\n\n*From Keymap style section > click on customize button (first one).\n\n*Create new entries with your personal shortcuts to duplicate the japanese keys binding: hankaku/zenhankaku, muhenkan, eisu.\n\n*Run ibus-daemon -drx to reload and take configurations into effect if necessary.\n\n*If messed things up, click on reset to defaults button from Mozc Settings window.\n\nThat's all!\nGraphical abstract\nSteps to create the key bindings to toggle Japanese syllabaries input mode.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe problem: how to type Japanese using a non-Japanese keyboard?\nIn Japanese (日本語, nihongo), you need to write using a lot of different symbols-sets.\nA informal categorization of these sets can be like:\n\n*\n\n*all alphabets syllabaries (ひらがな hiragana, かたかな katakana, 漢字 kanji, ローマ字 romaji),\n\n*(han)dakuten, contractions, combinations and variants (e.g. ゜maru, ゛tenten, uppercase, lowercase, full-width, half-width etc),\n\n*symbols in Japanese style (e.g. Japanese period。, 「Japanese quote」, Japaneseーhiphen etc).\n\nSo, dedicated keys exists on Japanese keyboards to toggle between them.\nAn analogy with occidental keyboard are the Capslock key to upper/lower-case or, Shift key to insert symbols.\nBut the occidental keyboard hasn't these Japanese keys.\nSo how to type in Japanese using a non-Japanese keyboard?\nSolutions\nBasically, two solutions can be listed:\n\n*\n\n*install a Japanese keyboard or,\n\n*binding Japanese keys, by software level, in your non-Japanese keyboard.\n\nSolution 1: Install a Japanese keyboard\nEasiest solution so far.\nAcquire one Japanese keyboard, install and configure on your Operation System.\nBut you need access to one, maybe buying one (with international credit card, taxes, waiting for shipping and so on).\nSolution 2: Binding Japanese keys in your non-Japanese keyboard.\nIt is a cheap solution and you can use it in any keyboard you have.\nBut you need to install software, configure, and memorize MANY key combinations.\nIt is basically \"a sea of shortcuts\" to emulate the Japanese keyboard.\nLinux have some software to simulate a Japanese keyboard for using a non-Japanese keyboard.\nLet's implement the solution 2.\nTheoretical background\nLinux input software layers\nOur computer can receive inputs from many talked/typed languages and hardware (i.e. different keyboards and layouts).\nSo it needs to organize the configurations and permit to the user choice between different languages.\nFor example, a user can type one document in Italian AND English languages, at alternating times.\nSo the software needs to show the user a way to change the language to be inputted.\nThe Linux user have 2 layers of software to configure the input method by keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*Input Method Framework (IMF): a class of software that organize the inputs (from keyboard, mouse etc), send to the correct destination (software, systems etc), and configure them.\n\n*Input Method Editor/Engine (IME): a class of software that receives the inputted characters (from a keyboard), translate them to the desired input (i.e. idiom, language) and, send them to the Input Method Framework (IMF) to handle them.\nBasically, we have: from keyboard > (typed/inputted keys) > IME (receives and translate them) > (translated inputted keys) > IMF (handle translated inputted keys to destinations).\n\nFor the Linux user, an example o IMF is IBus; an a example of IME is MOZC.\nThe first one will switch between all installed IMEs and switch between all idioms/languages installed too.\nThe second one, if selected, will send to the IMF only Japanese keys, even if you typed in a non-Japanese keyboard.\nAbout Japanese IMEs, you can read more about here, and visualize the states/events in these diagrams:\nDiagram 1:\n\nDiagram 2:\n\nJapanese keyboard\nLayout\nThe Japanese keyboard layout (キーボード) is established by Japanese International Standard (JIS).\nFirst of all, let's contemplate the Japanese keyboard!\nWatch an open box video.\nYou can see the vector draw bellow, showing clearly the Japanese keys:\n\nFinally, some real pictures bellow:\n\n\nTry to identify each key, slowly.\nWe have:\n\n*\n\n*Roman letter (QWERTY).\n\n*Hiragana symbols.\n\n*Small hiragana symbols.\n\n*Han-dakuten symbols (maru, tenten).\n\n*Arithmetic symbols.\n\n*Capslock, shift, super, alt, tab, Ctrl, Enter, Backspace.\n\n*Punctuation with Japanese style (period, quotes etc).\n\n*and some special keys with Japanese words:\n\n*\n\n*muhenkan 無変換: don't convert kana to kanji.\n\n*henkan 変換: convert kana to kanji.\n\n*hiragana/Katakana/romaji カタカナ / ひらがな / ローマ字:\n\n*hankaku/zenkaku 半角 / 全角: switch between half-width or full-width\n\n*kanji 半角 / 全角 / 漢字: switch between kanji or English characters.\n\n*eisū 英数: switch to alphanumeric characters.\n\n\n\nYou can have more description of these specific keys here.\nAnd read about the text frequency of hiragana, katakana e kanji and here.\nTyping\nHow a Japanese user type on this keyboard?\n\n*\n\n*Answer 1: type phonetically, using romaji mode. Yes, they use romaji!\n\n*Answer 2: it can type in kana mode, too, using hiragana keys.\n\nFor example, lets type \"kakikukeko\" in romaji mode:\n\n*\n\n*First, select romaji mode.\n\n*Typing, in a QWERTY keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*type k, outputs: ｋ.\n\n*type a, outputs: か (ka).\n\n*type k, outputs: かｋ.\n\n*type i, outputs: かき (kaki).\n\n*type k, outputs: かきｋ.\n\n*type u, outputs: かきく (kakiku).\n\n*type k, outputs: かきくｋ.\n\n*type e, outputs: かきくけ (kakikuke).\n\n*type k, outputs: かきくけｋ.\n\n*type o, outputs: かきくけこ (kakikukeko).\n\n*type ENTER, outputs: かきくけこ (kakikukeko ).\n\n\n\nAnother example, type \"kakikukeko\" in hiragana mode.\n\n*\n\n*First, select kana mode.\n\n*Typing, in a QWERTY keyboard:\n\n*\n\n*type t, outputs: か (ka).\n\n*type g, outputs: かき (kaki).\n\n*type k, outputs: かきく (kakiku).\n\n*type :, outputs: かきくけ (kakikuke).\n\n*type b, outputs: かきくけこ (kakikukeko).\n\n*type ENTER, outputs: かきくけこ (kakikukeko ).\n\n\n\nAnd to convert to katakana or kanji is the same thing.\nYou can toggle to katakana mode or kanji mode and type on romaji or hiragana.\nAnd the computer will pop up an autocomplete window to you select your desired word.\nMethod\nNow, we will use software to type Japanese in a non-Japanese keyboard.\nMy system when I create this text was:\n\n*\n\n*My OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS\n\n*My Japanese IME: Mozc 2.20.2673.102\n\n*My IMF: Ibus 1.5.17\n\n*My keyboard: Latin keyboard (with ç, ~, ^ and so on).\n\nInstall\nUbuntu came with the IMF IBus (like a built in).\nBut if you need to install IBus:\nsudo apt install ibus\n\nNext, let's install our Japanese IME MOZC:\nsudo apt install ibus-mozc\n\nObservation: look at the name of the package ibus-mozc.\nIts our IMF + IME names.\nSo, in future we can search on APT repositories for IMF and Japanese IME alternatives, like ibus-*, or *-mozc.\nInstallations completed!\nConfigurations\nA Japanese keyboard has many different keys, to switch:\nIt is necessary to edit and memorize the Japanese input software's (binding) shortcut keys.\nHiragana, katakana, kanji, romaji, upper/lower-case, full/half-width, Japanese symbols (period, quote, maru, tenten etc).\nSo, you need to memorize/edit the keys to (des)activate the switches.\nSee the screenshots from before to get a hint of where the MOZC keymap is.\nTo edit/read these keys on your Mozc:\n\n\n*Open a text editor (e.g. Gedit) and stay with it in foreground.\n\n*Select Mozc input mode:\nHold Super and press Space as many times as to select Mozc option.\nOr click on:\nIBus (at GNOME Status Menu) > Japanese (Mozc).\n\n*To read/edit these Japanese key bindings, click on:\nIBus (at GNOME Status Menu) > Tools > Properties.\n\n*After Mozc Setting window popped up, click on:\nGeneral tab > Keymap section (at bottom) > Keymap Style customize button (first one).\n\n*After Mozc keymap editor window popped up, click on:\nScroll up and down to memorize and edit the Japanese keymap (bindings).\n\n*Probably, you may will toggle between all Mozc's input modes (hiragana, katakana, romaji etc) if you duplicate and edit these binding keys for your chosen shortcuts.\nBasically, to switch between syllabaries using MOZC, you need to memorize/edit/press:\n\n\n*\n\n*hankaku/zenhankaku key: to turn IME on/off.\n\n*muhenkan key: to toggle kana syllabaries.\n\n*eisu key (or shift+muhenkan keys) to toggle latin input (i.e. romaji).\n\nFrom MOZC's source-code, see the table with all matches to the Japanese JIS special keys, as bellow:\n...\nComposition Eisu    ToggleAlphanumericMode\nConversion  Eisu    ToggleAlphanumericMode\nDirectInput Eisu    IMEOn\nPrecomposition  Eisu    ToggleAlphanumericMode\n...\nComposition

similar with these, like bellow (these are my shortcut sugestions):\n...\nComposition Ctrl j  IMEOff\nConversion  Ctrl j  IMEOff\nDirectInput Ctrl j  IMEOn\nPrecomposition  Ctrl j  IMEOff\nComposition Ctrl b  SwitchKanaType\nConversion  Ctrl b  SwitchKanaType\nComposition Ctrl y  ToggleAlphanumericMode\nConversion  Ctrl y  ToggleAlphanumericMode\nDirectInput Ctrl y  IMEOn\nPrecomposition  Ctrl y  ToggleAlphanumericMode\n...\n\nIf you are interested, you can read MOZC's romaji-hiragana conversion table.\n\n\n*If you mess the things, click on reset to defauts button at Mozc setting window (opened in Step 3).\n\nIf you edit these shortcuts, please consider conflicts with your existing shortcuts from:\n\n*\n\n*Operating system shortcuts (Ubuntu).\n\n*Graphical shell shortcuts (Gnome, KDE).\n\n*App shortcuts (firefox, gedit, libreoffice, gimp).\n\n*Personalized shortcuts (your personal shortcuts).\n\nWith these key bindings you can type very well in a non-japanese keyboard.\nWe didn't binding the others japanese keys to let you study the subject.\nAlternative solutions\nSimilar softwares\nIm using IBus to be my input method editor (IME).\nBut you can switch to other IMF/IME if you desire.\nOthers IMEs are:\n\n*\n\n*Anthy: sudo apt install ibus-anthy.\n\n*KKC: sudo apt install ibus-kkc.\n\n*SKK: sudo apt install ibus-skk.\n\nThe same as to input method framework (IMF), like:\n\n*\n\n*Fcitx: sudo apt install fcitx.\n\n*\n\n*and you need to change the IME when installing like:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt install fcitx-mozc.\n\n*sudo apt install fictx-kkc.\n\n*sudo apt install fictx-skk.\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of IMF can be found List of input methods for Unix platforms and Linux input method framework brief summary.\nEdit keymap file by a text editor\nYou can manage the keymap saving, editing, import/export and so on.\nTo do that, read the file at source-code.\nIf you wanna, you can download this file and edit it to be imported into your MOZC software.\nSo, to import/export the keymap file:\n\n\n*At GNOME Status Menu, select MOZC input method.\n\n*Again at GNOME Status Menu, select Tools > Properties.\n\n*After Mozc Setting window popped up, click on:\nGeneral tab > Keymap section (at bottom) > Keymap Style customize button (first one).\n\n*And after Mozc keymap editor window popped up, click on:\nEdit button menu (at bottom) > click import from file... or export from file....\nWith that you can save (export) your keymap editions.\nAnd you can to insert a new keymap edited by importing it.\n\nThat's all!\nReferences\nYou may be interested in read this MOZC

I already have 4 Help I want to remove my partitions everything apart from my windows 7 how can I do this ?\nhttp://fpaste.org/159716/07549141/ \n\nA: Both Windows and Ubuntu provide graphical interfaces to manage partitions.\nYour question is unclear, so I will answer both potential questions:\n\n*\n\n*If you wish to keep both your Ubuntu OS partition and your Windows partition, then from within Ubuntu you may run the \"Disks\" utility. Type \"Disks\" into the search field of the Ubuntu menu.\nFirst select the disk, then select the partition you wish to delete and click the - symbol below it.\n\n\n*If you wish to delete the Ubuntu OS partition as well, leaving only the Windows partition, you may boot to Windows and access a similar tool by going control panel->(set view to large icons in the top right)->administrative tools->computer management->disk manager or run diskmgmt.msc.\nFrom here you may select disks, and right click on partitions to delete them.\nBe certain you wish to delete a partition, recovering them completely is usually impossible.\n\nA: Gparted in Ubuntu is a good partition management tool.  I believe you can use it to delete partitions and then resize/enlarge other partitions.  Be very careful though and make sure you've backed up all of your data before you try any of this.\n\nA: Your best option is GParted live. I imagine you will need to incorporate the free space into the other partitions after you've deleted them. GParted live can merge, delete, create, pretty much all the possible functionality. Better to use the live version than the desktop one. Make sure you get acquainted with it first before you use it, a couple of YouTube tutorials will do the trick and make sure you have another device with you while doing it to look anything up, the built-in browser functionality is extremely limited.\n", "Q: Reinstall with full-disk encryption I'm looking to reinstall ubuntu (actually, switch from ubuntu to xubuntu) and currently have full disk encryption enabled.\nI downloaded xubuntu to a USB and booted of it; when going through the installation process it never asks for the decryption password on the drive and tells me that there isn't an existing installation... how to I install without over-writing my current data?\n\nA: Xubuntu says there is no install because your disk is encrypted, so the Xubuntu installer can't tell there's an existing Ubuntu install, and doesn't know it can be decrypted. Op success on that front.\nThe best way to swap from Ubuntu to Xubuntu is just to install the Xfce desktop on the existing system.\nHow do I switch to Xubuntu?\nOnce you're happy with the xfce desktop and have confirmed it works, you can optionally go the extra mile with sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop, although I personally would keep it installed as a backup desktop.\n", "Q: How do I install OBS Studio on 14.10? As FFMPEG is not \"officially\" supported on 14.10, how do I install it?\nI'm trying to get OBS Studio to work on 14.10, and FFMPEG is a dependency I cannot satisfy...\n\nA: You have several options to get FFmpeg, but I am not familiar with OBS so I'm not sure what its exact requirements are.\nDownload\nThe simplest method is to download a static build of the ffmpeg binary. If OBS only wants the binary this could work. If it needs the libraries you will need to compile or use a PPA.\nYou may have to place the binary somewhere in your $PATH for OBS to recognize it, or perhaps manually tell OBS where it is.\nPPA\nmc4man provides recent ffmpeg binaries via his PPA: Ubuntu Multimedia for Trusty. I believe this provides support for libfdk_aac (an execellent AAC audio encoder) while the static build I mentioned previously does not. Libraries are not included.\nJon Severinsson's FFmpeg PPA provides older FFmpeg branches to be compatible with dependencies in the repository.\nCompile\nStep-by-step, non-intrusive compilation instructions are available at FFmpeg Wiki: Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu. The guide \"installs\" within your home directory so it does not interfere with the system; binaries into ~/bin and libraries and other stuff into ~/ffmpeg_build.\n\nRequired Version\nOBS may require a certain version or release of FFmpeg if it is not compatible with the current git master of FFmpeg. If this is the case you can compile any version you need. Follow the compile guide, but after cloning the repository with git clone run git tag to list branch versions, then git checkout <tag name>. To go back to the master branch run git checkout master.\nThe Return of the King\nFFmpeg will be back in Ubuntu in 15.04.\n", "Q: No option to boot windows after installing ubuntu I already have windows installed and I just installed Ubuntu and I was expecting that it will ask me which OS to boot after startup but it didn't.\nI refer the link but didn't work Windows 7 not showing up in boot after installing Ubuntu.\nI set the option of Erase disk and install Ubuntu.

I want to create git server and want to host a java project which has been written in 3 tier archituctere, it means that their might be multiple project(git repository) such as client, server, common etc. to all other developers with their own credential(username, password). The other developers will pull and commit through their own username and password. I don't know how it is to be done even I had search different sites and forume but I din't get it.\nplz help me from scretch. \n\nA: Common approach to organize ssh repo on a server. Just create a folder /git in root folder, then assign a group to it with write permissions, and all the users, which be able to read or write to the repo, assign to the group. So a user can create git repo:\n$ cd /git\n$ mkdir project-1\n$ cd project-1\n$ git init\n$ touch README\n$ git add README \n$ git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\nOf course you should have the properlt setup users account on both local and remote PCs. So for example, we create the user account user1 on local PC, and user2 on the remote one:\n$ sudo useradd user1\n$ ssh sudo useradd user2\n$ sudo remote_pc -c 'sudo useradd user2'\n\nThen we should be able to issue git commands: clone, pull, and push:\n$ git clone git+ssh://user2@remotepc/git/project-1\n$ cd project-1\n$ git pull\n$ git push\n\nYpu also should know on how to configure passwordless access to remote git repo via ssh, and to setup git-shell.\n", "Q: install Ubuntu 14 on virtual box I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.10 desktop on virtual box but it is crashing when live cd start booting up.\nMy host is Ubuntu 12.04 and virtual machine 4.1.12_ubuntu r77245.\nI need to install Ubuntu 14.10 on the virtual Box running on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Yes I have tried and It will work. \n\nThere is a known issue with VirtualBox and the Ubuntu 8.04 and later Server releases.

Which expression should I use and what is a good source on learning regular expressions such as these? \nOn Windows I would have used Total Commander's multi rename function which has a very simple renaming syntax. Are there some good alternatives for that tool (multi-rename) for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Using rename\nA generally useful tool for this type of activity is rename from the perl package.  It applies a perl substitution to the file name:\nrename 's/file/file0/' file[0-9][0-9].ext\n\nHow this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*s/file/file0/\nThis is a perl substitution command.  It replaces the occurrence of file in a file name with file0.\n\n*file[0-9][0-9].ext\nThis is the list of files that rename is to operate on.  [0-9] means any number from 0 to 9.  [0-9][0-9] means any two numbers, one following the other. \nThe manpage for rename is here.\nNote: This requires the perl version of rename.  There is also a rename utility that is part of util-linux but it works differently.\nUsing bash\nThis approach uses a for loop combined with pattern substitution:\nfor f in file[0-9][0-9].ext; do mv \"$f\" \"${f/file/file0}\"; done\n\nHow it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*for f in file[0-9][0-9].ext; do\nThis starts a loop over each file name that matches the glob file[0-9][0-9].ext.\n\n*mv \"$f\" \"${f/file/file0}\"\nThis renames the files using the bash's pattern substitution.  It replaces file with file0` in the file name.\n\n*done\nThis marks the end of the for loop.\nThis approach requires bash (or other advanced shell).  \nbash is the default interactive shell and this approach will work under bash.  Thus, this should work on the usual command line.\n\nA: This rename with using different regex:\nrename -n 's/[^0-9](([0-9]){2})\\.ext$/0$1.ext/' *\n\n[^0-9](([0-9]){2})\\.ext$ Matches any non-digit[^0-9] followed by group of numbers with length=2 which is ends with .ext. So in replacement part, add a 0 and prints group of matched $1 and then their extension.\nOr alternative for regex:\nrename -n 's/[^\\d](\\d{2})\\.ext$/0$1.ext/' *\n\n\\d matches a number.\n", "Q: gnome--terminal -e option not executing?

If the mail is legitimate, the originating server will try again after a delay, and if sufficient time has elapsed, the email will be accepted.\n\nSo it is better to test that outgoing mail reaches your notification address before expecting apticron to work.\nI used mail command as described in this answer.\n\nNOTE: it might be a good idea to use some test service like mail-tester.com first in a hope to not get your dedicated IP instantly flagged by real e-mail provider like Google or the one that serves your recipient. It is just a thought though, I have no idea if such test services actually work that way, but it would be a logical assumption.\n\nBy reading auto-reply from mail I saw that my e-mail was not delivered with a mention of\nSorry, the service is currently unavailable. Please come back later\n\nIf you simply remove --cron parameter apticron will execute every hour instead of once per day. Which probably results in bypassing greylisting protection but does not fix real issues. E.g. my test e-mails ended up in spam.\n", "Q: How do I subset and copy directories using a csv?

Or can you use a jumpbox that has a static IP?  If this is the case, you can set an iptables rule that only allows SSH access to a specific IP(s).  This will give you implicit deny to anyone except the static IPs.\nThe other recommendations would be to change the service to listen on a non-standard port, disable root authentication, and configure fail2ban.\n\nA: Try changing your sshd port to 1000+. Fail2ban helps too.\nFor example i have some servers running sshd on 1919 or 905 and I barely get these chinese IPs trying to bruteforce my servers. \n", "Q: Making xinput id permanent I use Chrome to set up a kiosk-style application at launch, following the instructions left in this question: Chrome + Touchscreen + Unity (14.04)\nI use xinput list to figure out the ID of the device and it works fine for a time.

They all have a somewhat steep learning curve.\nThis sounding fairly opinion based, my favorite mixing software is LMMS, and I can verify that it does work with a MIDI keyboard to USB because I have one.\n", "Q: TP LINK WN722n not working on ubuntu 14.02 I'm new to ubuntu, so I'm learning.

Referencing (retrieving) its value is called variable substitution. The $ sign helps us to get the value.\n\nLet us carefully distinguish between the name of a variable and its\n  value. If variable1 is the name of a variable, then $variable1 is\n  a reference to its value, the data item it contains, for example:\n\nWe define variable1 with a value 23:\n$ variable1 = 23\n\nTo print the name of the variable (echo is just like a print function in the terminal):\n$ echo variable1\nvariable1\n\nTo print the actual value saved in the variable\n$ echo $variable1\n23\n\n\nA: Variables in your shell are marked with a $. I assume a path has been stored as $FOAM_RUN.

Of course, this could have its limitations if you are using this to detect unwanted intruders in your network who may be able to fly under the radar.

Why is free -m showing all memory consumed. How do I control this behavior. Apparently, I am not utilizing all memory. How can I do that ? Do I need to change swap memory ?\n\nA: Don't do anything: The Linux kernel is using as much memory as possible instead of letting it sit idle doing nothing by allocating free memory to the cache.\nYou can control the cache, but doing so would make your system perform worse as all disk access would actually be disk access instead of cached disk access.\n(actually you should have moved to a server containing even more memory as you are running into swap)\nHere's my system:\nfree -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3886       3777        109        256         24       2572\n-/+ buffers/cache:       1180       2705\nSwap:         9755          0       9755\n\nAlso very low free, but using a ton of memory for cache and when applications need memory, it'll be released from the cache.\n\nA: \nApache Server serving around 1000 hits a day\n\nDo you always use canons to shoot birds? A thousand hits a day? Seriously? Why don't you use a more light-weighted solution then the monster apache?\nAt least tune your Apache config, otherwise it's no wonder you run out of memory. My guess is that the apache is able to take several 100K hits, the way it's setup. But to provide so much connections, it simply HAS to take up most of the ram.\nIf I were you I'd ditch apache completly and take Lighttpd for better memory distribution.\n", "Q: Reason for really slow 14.04 LTS performance Ubuntu newbie/ computer novice with a question on performance.\nDownloaded Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from a purchased disk.

This is what Iain Farrell had to say:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Images shouldn’t be too busy and filled with too many shapes and colours, a similar tone throughout is a good rule of thumb.\n  \n*A single point of focus, a single area that draws the eye into the image, can also help you avoid something too cluttered.\n  \n*The left and top edges are home to Ubuntu’s Launcher and Panel so be careful to consider how your images look in place so as not to clash with the user interface. Try them out on your own desktop, see how they feel.\n  \n*Try your image at different aspect ratios to make sure something important isn’t cropped out on smaller/ larger screens at different resolutions.\n  \n*Take a look at the wallpapers guidance on the Ubuntu Wiki regarding the size of images.

For example, both of the following records represent what to do for .mp3 files. The critical is the [Default Applications] section:\n[Default Applications]\naudio/mpeg=rhythmbox.desktop\naudio/x-mp3=audacious.desktop\n\n[Added Associations]\naudio/mpeg=mplayer.desktop;\naudio/x-mp3=smplayer.desktop;audacious.desktop;\n\nBoth mime types audio/mpeg and audio/x-mp3 refer to the files of type \".mp3\". Therefore the \"open-with\" system gets confused.\nThe solution: delete the equivalent mime types until only one remains. Or, delete all of them and reset the associations using only one tool of your choice.\nThe possible cause: assigning file associations by different tools, tweaks or by hand, using different mime type names for the same mime type.\n", "Q: What is the default domain on Ubuntu VPS? I have a VPS running and I have installed webmin to host a few domains. What is the default domain name for the server?\nMy service provider doesn't give me any default domain, just a static IP address.  I was wondering if I need to obtain a domain somewhere to act as default domain name for the server? \nIf I send an email as root or ubuntu users as an example, it goes out with the username@hostname but not like username@hostname.com.\nIf I run, hostname --fqdn it returns with the machine hostname (myhostname) and not myhostname.com so I'm looking forward to assign a domain to my VPS, is that a setting in Apache or a setting in the server?\n\nA: TL;DR: There is no domain name ever provided with a VPS by default, in most VPS providers' setups, as it's likely your provider (and a lot of other VPS providers) are not Domain Name Registrars and do not provide the option for you to purchase a domain name to go with your server.\n\nSlightly more informational:\nThere is no real need to assign a 'domain' to a VPS.  Therefore, VPSes don't typically come with a domain name.  I believe you are misunderstanding how VPSes work from providers.\nIn some cases, VPS providers also provide you with the option to register a domain name for use with the VPS.  However, most VPS providers are not web domain registrars in their own right, and therefore they do not provide you a domain.\nYou have to purchase a domain separately through a registrar, and point the domain name's DNS A record to the IP address of your VPS.  From there, you can then set up a web server to listen and serve content for that domain.  Note that this is a separate service from a separate company, and you need to set up the domain and DNS in order for it to work.\n\nIF you have no domain but want your sent-locally emails to have something at the end like localmonitor@hostname.com, you can try and set your FQDN with sudo hostname hostname.com or something, but this is still not the answer to 'What is the default domain', as there is no default domain.\n", "Q: raid10: can't read superblock Up until a few minutes ago I had a functioning raid 10 device (/dev/md0) consisting of 4 x 3TB disks.\nMy operating system (headless ubuntu server 14.04.1 lts) is mounted on a 120GB SSD seperate from the raid.\nI was reading about noatime and that it is good for SSDs (i am new to ssds) so I edited /etc/fstab to add noatime to my ssd entry.\nI then tried rebooting the headless server and it would hang during boot because it could not mount my raid /dev/md0 under /mnt/raiddisk:\nThe disk drive for /mnt/raiddisk is not ready yet or not present.\nContinue to wait, or press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery.\n\nNow I have booted by skipping the mounting of the raid device.\ncat /proc/mdstat says:\nPersonalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]\nmd0 : inactive sdd1[3](S) sdc1[2](S) sdb1[1](S)\n8790402048 blocks super 1.2\n\nunused devices: <none> \n\nThere is one disk missing in the above list, there should be also sde\nTrying to mount manually using sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raiddisk gives the following output:\nmount: /dev/md0: can't read superblock\n\nAfter some reading I tried:\nsudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n\nAnd got this message:\nmdadm: /dev/sdb1 is busy - skipping\nmdadm: /dev/sdc1 is busy - skipping\nmdadm: /dev/sdd1 is busy - skipping\nmdadm: /dev/md0 is already in use.\n\nSo I stopped /dev/md0 and tried again and this time it seems to have worked:\nmdadm: /dev/md0 has been started with 4 drives.\n\nNow cat /proc/mdstat gives:\nPersonalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10]\nmd0 : active raid10 sda1[0] sdd1[3] sdc1[2] sdb1[1]\n5860267008 blocks super 1.2 512K chunks 2 near-copies [4/4] [UUUU]\n\nunused devices: <none>\n\nI was now able to mount it at /mnt/raiddisk.\nUpon trying to restart it again hangs during boot because it cannot mount the raid device.\nNot sure what else to test/check as I am a raid newbie.\n\nA: I was able to fix it.\nUpon inspecting the output of sudo parted -l and cat /proc/mdstat as well as looking in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf I noticed that the device labels for the harddisks seem to have changed after I tried adding noatime in /etc/fstab.\nMy ssd used to have the label /dev/sda this then changed to /dev/sde\nSo md could not auto assemble the raid array upon boot because it could not add /dev/sde to the raid as this was now the ssd for the boot partition.\nUpon updating mdadm.conf and adding the updated disk labels and then running update-initramfs -u I was able to reboot normally and the raid array is assembled and mounted.\nI have no idea why simply adding noatime to my ssd entry in /etc/fstab did this.\nI have since removed noatime from my /etc/fstab as I am terrified of it happening again.\n", "Q: USB ubuntu - how to retrieve saved data after reboot I saved couple of important files from my windows computer to USB Ubuntu while Ubuntu was running. But on restarting the USB Ubuntu I am unable to locate those files. is it normal that it  is erased? or is there any way i have get it back? I created a .New folder within documents and placed the files in that folder. but once i shut down Ubuntu and opened again those files are nowhere.. please help\n\nA: Any changes made after booting with an Ubuntu live USB (including files/folders created) are usually erased when you shutdown, unless you made the live USB persistent when you created it.  That means that a file is created on the USB where the changes are stored.  Persistence is usually not done by default - only if you request it when you create the USB.\nIf you want to make the USB persistent then you'll need to create it again from scratch and make a persistent file.  I believe PenDriveLinux's program and Ubuntu's own live USB creator can make it persistent.\n(technically, I don't think the files are actually wiped when you shut down - I believe they only exist in RAM and aren't copied to the USB)\n", "Q: Error starting ClamAV daemon I can't get the ClamAV daemon to start on my Ubuntu 14.04 server.

Look for other partitions on the same drive, your data is most likely on the last 1-2 partitions.\nAnd bear in mind that if the disk has been physically damaged you may not be able to recover your data. That is why people invented backups.\n", "Q: How do I use Juju local with a firewall?

I did a search beforehand and I don't think a similar question has been asked before.\nI have two hard disk drives - a 1TB Seagate and a 1TB Western Digital.  My Seagate drive crashed a while back and I suspect it may have some damaged sectors.  I was just wondering what is the best way to perform a hard drive scan in Ubuntu and check hard disk health in general?  I know both Seagate and WD provide their own software for scanning and repairing drives - can these be installed in Ubuntu?  If not then can anyone tell me what method is recommended?  Or, is it better to use the manufacturer's proprietary software through Windows?\n\nA: I did a bit more reading into this myself.  These two pages gives some tips about scanning hard drives/filesystems in Linux (they also mention fsck and badblocks):\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/37659/the-beginners-guide-to-linux-disk-utilities/\nhttp://mypage.uniserve.ca/~thelinuxguy/doc/hdtest.html\nThere is also the Ubuntu 'Disk Utility' package, which allows checking of the HDD SMART status.\n\nA: You can use the command smartctl from the package smartmontools:\nsudo apt install smartmontools\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda\n\nWhere /dev/sda is the name of the device you want to scan.\n\nA: A standard filesystem scan is usually done with fsck. This application handles most filesystems out of the box. However, you may need to install NTFS support separately on some installations.\nIf you'd like to do a surface scan of your drive you can use e2fsck. Use the -c option to do a bad sector scan.\nIt should also be mentioned that nearly every Linux distro is also configured by default to periodically scan your fixed drives on boot. They will also typically be setup to do this on a schedule (this is important since most Linux boxes rarely need to be reset).\n", "Q: Change language to arabic without changing window/GUI alignment I recently changed my language to arabic but I found that the GUI is flipped horizontally which is not so nice and kinda nauseous. How do I make the GUI left-aligned with arabic language still present? Thanks!\n\n\n\nA: As Arabic is an RTL (right-to-left) language, you cannot. The UI elements are changed position, because that is how they are supposed to be displayed, in order to fit the right-to-left orientation of the language.\nAnother answer on UX StackExchange has some more info on why it is necessary.\n", "Q: How to run a complex command by xfce mail-watcher I just installed the xfce4-mailwatch-plugin  I would like to use the option \"Run on click\" to either switch to Thunderbird, or to open it if it is not currently running. The command I use for this is wmctrl -a thunderbird || thunderbird&.\nSince this is not working, I defined an alias for this command in /etc/bash.bashrc, but this does not have the effect I expected. The command works fine if launched from a shell, but launched by the mail-watcher this does not have any effect. However, just calling one of the two commands in question from the mail-watcher works fine.\n\nA: Aliases are specific to the shell and most likely xfce4-mailwatch-plugin knows nothing about them. That is why it isn't working for you.\nThe || and & are also shell-specific.\nI suggest you create a 2-line script (the first line being #!/bin/sh) that does what needs to be done, save it and make it executable. Then configure xfce4-mailwatch-plugin to execute that script.\n", "Q: Cannot boot, laptop screen doesn't work, may have broken grub My laptop's built in screen has been out of commission for awhile, which usually isn't a problem since I use an external monitor, but the GRUB/BIOS menus don't appear on the external monitor.\nI was trying to get it to display on the second monitor, and changed the kernel parameter to nomodeset via Grub Customizer, since I had seen it suggested and figured it probably would be easy to change back if it didn't help. I also set the grub menu to automatically open on start up, and do the default boot after ten seconds. Well, it actually made the problem many magnitudes worse, and now my laptop is unusable.\nI turn it on, still can't see the menu, and it doesn't automatically boot after 10 seconds like it should. I've tried inserting my Ubuntu live CD, hoping that maybe something would happen. Nothing happened.\nI'm not sure if I screwed up and broke grub, or if it's a different problem, but either way it's a big problem. Is there any way that I can fix this without being able to see what I'm doing? I considered using my brother's computer to burn a rescue disc, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to boot one up with my computer in its current state.\n\nA: That's weird you don't see bios/grub menu's on the monitor.  Do you have the laptop lid open? Also, it would help if we knew what laptop model it was.  Usually you can boot to a live cd even in the state that it's in.  Just plug in a monitor with the computer lid closed(but open just enough so you can turn it on) so you get video so you can a least know what your doing, then boot to Ubuntu live cd.  I don't really know what to do from there, hope this might help you.  \nEDIT:\nTry this link may help you:\n  http://ubuntu.aspcode.net/view/635400140124705175542464/cant-boot-up-ubuntu-after-changing-grub-file-with-nomodeset\nEDIT:\nOk so it looks like you might have to press a combination of keys to get to see the bios.  Try doing FN and one of the F keys(usually the one for the display has a little monitor on the key).  Also, try locating the lock magnet on your laptop lid and put a magnet to trick it into thinking it's closed, but not really(so you'll have access to the keyboard, mouse, power button). \n", "Q: Should I restore my backup or reinstall program's first? If I want to make a new Ubuntu install just like my last one, should I restore from my backup first, then install all my programs, or vice versa?\nThe backup included the entire home folder and only that. Backup from deja dup (default Ubuntu backup software).\n\nA: It does not matter. Because if you install and run the software after restoring back, the software will start using config files right away, because those files came from restore.\nbut when you install software and then restore the config files will be overwritten. You will be back when you made the backup. if you do this way, make sure you have closed all the GUI software and start them after restore of back so that the installed programs start with old config files and you get your system as you had expected\nIn either case make sure you reboot or at-least log-off and login immediately\nbesides you did backup and restoration using deja-dup, if you had to face any problem it will warn you.

It will show hidden files and directories.\nFind .mozilla or .chromium (any other browser you have) directory. It stores configuration files for the browser. Delete this folder. \nAfter that try entering facebook.com. It should help. \n(Note that deleting this folder will erase all custom settings you have made like password, extensions,etc. and will make browser as it is in new installation)\nAlso check if facebook is not blocked in your computer.

I cannot get Facebook to load in any of my browsers on either of my ubuntu machines.\nWhat I have tried. Changing DNS servers on the router and the ubuntu machines, resetting and configuring the router, power cycling the cable modem,clearing all browsing data, and disabling ufw. Nothing fixes the issue.\nMy Windows 7 machines load Facebook with no issues.\n\nA: I had the same issue working on Ubuntu 14.04- Muzzafar's solution above worked a treat for me, but then you do lose your custom settings in chromium.\nDownloading the chrome browser for linux direct from google means that you can then use that for browsing when custom settings are useful or necessary. But there are probably disadvantages with this app- which is not in the official Ubuntu repository (it is in the Mint repository though I think).\n", "Q: How to recover lost data during upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04.1LTS? I upgraded from 12.10 to 14.04.1LTS via usb this past Saturday afternoon. Prior to doing the upgrade, I backed everything up to an external HD. At least, I thought I backed everything up... Turns out I missed the default downloads folder and I missed more current versions of a few files in a subdirectory of my home folder...\nI made this unfortunate discovery when I first went to look at the downloads folder on Saturday evening and everything that was in downloads using 12.10 was gone using 14.04.1. I made the even more unpleasant discovery tonight that a spreadsheet I thought was copied during the backup to my external HD was missing more recent data that was saved to a version within my home directory using 12.10.\nWhen I first installed 12.10 a while back, I split my internal HD 250Gb/250Gb for parallel use of 12.10 and win7. When I did the 14.04.1LTS install, I selected the first option to install Ubuntu alongside Win7 since in the description it said \"all personal folders, docs, music, etc would be kept\". I suspect I misinterpreted that to mean \"all personal folders within the Ubuntu partition would be kept\" instead of \"all personal folders on the Win7 partition would be kept and all Ubuntu folders would be erased\". I didn't make any changes to the 250Gb/250Gb split during the 14.04.1 install and both partitions are still there, both functioning correctly to the best of my knowledge.\nI have restarted at least 2 times since the 14.04.1 install completed due to additional software installs I did after the 14.04.1 upgrade (and prior to me realizing I messed up on the backup). I haven't done a lot of other work since the upgrade, but I did copy my backup folder from my external HD back to my home folder.\nSo the questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any hope for reverting back to my internal HD as of a particular time (Saturday am prior to the upgrade) so I can recover those files I missed during my backup?\n\n*How do I pull that small miracle off? I see testdisk and photorec pop up in a lot of search results, and I have read though https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery as well as a few others that come up during searches, but I'm not sure what is the best/most reliable/easiest way (I'm pretty new to open source, so I don't want to try things randomly only to make my situation worse.) I also don't know whether since 14.04.1 is now using the same partition that used to contain 12.10, if I can even recover that old data.\n\n\nFingers crossed...\n\nA: Update:\nWhether it was supposed to happen or not, it did; so I had to find a way to fix it. After lots of searching, waiting, and hoping for the best, I managed to recover my missing data!\nHere's how it went down:\nI determined that I really only needed to recover 2 spreadsheets as those were the files that I used most frequently and most recently since the version that was saved on the external HD. This alone was a HUGE step forward, especially since I knew what the files were named. My downloads folder was much larger, but I convinced myself that I could handle living without it if I really had to.\nFor the next steps, I switched over and ran Win7 since I already had the dual boot set up.\nI searched all over the place online and found lots of programs claiming to have the capability of recovering lost data/lost partitions/etc. I eventually settled on one called Linux Reader for Windows, provided free by Diskinternals. I was considering a few others, and they may work just as well, but Linux Reader is the one I actually used to recover my data.\nI downloaded the program to my Win7 partition, followed the directions available online and in the program (pretty easy to figure out/self navigate). It searched the partition I told it to. The search took longer than I wanted it to, partly because I started the search late at night, partly because Win7 decided to do an automatic update/restart mid-search so I had to start the search over again the following morning, and partly because of the volume of data it was searching (70Gb +/-). If I had to guess, it was probably 8-10 hours on the actual search.\nSearch finished, and the program asked if I wanted it to try to recover the data it found. (DUH...) The recovery took about 2.5 days and saved everything to the Win7 partition. Seriously slow. But, what it turned up was pretty awesome.\nI was very hesitant at first because I was afraid it was going to only find/recover data that I had already put back on the linux partition as I noted in my original post/question.\nBut, it found EVERYTHING. Literally- not only the most recent versions of the two spreadsheets that I really wanted to recover, but also a few versions prior to that.\nThe downloads folder is still up for debate as I'm not sure I want to spend the time to go through that much random disorganized data file by file.\nThe only gripe I have about the program (other than the speed, but that was a worthwhile trade off since it found everything I wanted it to) is that it doesn't maintain file names or file structures. Instead, it saves everything in folders by file type (.doc, .docx, .xls, etc), and in some cases, just converts it to a common format (.mp3 ended up as .wav). From there, within each folder it saves everything using numerical values, i.e. \"0000000016.doc\", instead of the original file name, i.e. \"dick and jane.doc\". Pretty annoying, but I got lucky that I knew what files I was looking for (spreadsheets), and had a rough idea of what the file size was based on the backup that I had made to the external HD. So I just had to sort by file size, then open every file until I found the right one.\nThis may not end up working for everyone, but it's how I managed to successfully work around my situation. If it helps someone else, even better.\n", "Q: eSata \"HotPlugged\" Drive Not Recognized So, I have an Optiplex 780 with esata on the back.

After that, Ubuntu loads the desktop and everything runs as usual.\nThis is happening in a laptop Dell Inspiron 1545 (Pentium 2GHz and 8GB RAM). \nI have installed bootchart and this is the image produced:\n\nIf I'm reading the output correctly, it takes 1 minute and 28 seconds to load.\nI'm almost certain that I haven't installed anything recently. Does anyone know what could be the cause?\nUPDATE\nIt takes 55 seconds to show the black screen and lasts 43 seconds until the desktop appears. A few seconds before that, it is possible to move the cursor. It looks similar to the interval with low CPU use in the upper graph from the bootchart output.\n\nA: Thanks for posting the boot chart.  I'm no expert but I noticed these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toward the start of the boot, there's a fsck followed by a mount operation that is taking a long time (over 20 seconds).  A fair bit of later stuff seems to be waiting for this operation.\n\n*Further on in the boot, there is what looks like gpu-manager running a \"find\" operation that is taking a long time.  I don't know why this would be, but a fair bit of later stuff (including lightdm, the graphical desktop) is waiting on this to finish.\n\nA: All the files needed until you boot to desktop might be scattered or at-least away from start of the partition which happened while your system was getting upgraded, since new files are written to disk and after that old files are remove(of-course its done so that you can revert back if upgrade is not successful) this way new files are written away from start of partition. It takes more time to fetch those files. To reduce this time you have to reallocate the data back. I don't know a straight forward way to do this, but it can be done by installing e4rat(which is experimental). I tried e4rat recently on ubuntu 14.04 my boot time decreased by 10secs. if you want you can try from here\n\nA: In my case it was a user issue:\nI experienced the same problem, also on 14.04 installed on an ssd drive.\nIt used to take 10 seconds to show a functional desktop and then it took 10 seconds to show a black screen with a pointer and another 30 seconds to show desktop.\nTry to create another user and set this user to autologin.\nIn my case it reduced boot time back to 9.5 seconds.\nNow I will copy my old settings/files to new user. I 'll update if I reach to a safe conclusion.\nUPDATE: I removed apport-gtk because I noticed an extreme CPU-usage during login and my system now behaves normally.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - unable to write bytes broken pipe - Precaution I am working with AOSP for Beagle-bone . \nDuring the development suddenly my PC shows an issue in booting & the message was \"unable to write bytes broken pipe\" . \nI have tried lot of solutions found online & nothing works.\nNow i just re-installed the OS in my PC causes waste of time & resources.\nSome of the ask-Ubuntu post says that the issue is regarding the \"updation of graphic drivers\".\nHow can i take some precautions , in order to being safe from this issue ? \n\nA: From the above error we hope so the drive which you have installed is not mounted. This might be causing the issue. So please try the below command, \nmount -o remount,rw,errors=remount-ro /\n\nAfter doing so please check the below, \ndkpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nOnce you are done.

I cannot access the mount point from the Mac.\nThe relevant line in /etc/exports is:\n/mnt/goflex  (rw)\n\nThe command I am running on the Mac is:\nsudo mount -t nfs TV:/goflex /private/goflex\n\nThis is the error message I get:\nmount_nfs: can't mount /goflex from TV onto /private/goflex: Permission denied\n\nWhen I run showmount -e TV on the Mac, it does see the export.\nCan anyone suggest what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: I ran into this same issue myself when trying to mount a git repo directory from Ubuntu to OSX 10.10.3.\nThere were several things I did to make this work:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set up a new group in Ubuntu called shared, to which I added a new user with the same name as my OSX user.  I also changed the group ownership of my git repository to shared.  I used the uid and gid for these in the next step.\n\n*Like you, I set up the NFS export and verified it using showmount.  However, in addition to rw, I also included the following: (rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,insecure,anonuid=<<uid>>,anongid=<<gid>>). I read somewhere that insecure is especially important when dealing with macs (something about tcp port restrictions).  Without that option, you're likely to get \"operation not permitted\" when mounting.\n\n*Spelled the damn directory path correctly - this turned out to be the most obvious problem, but took me the longest to figure out.  It seems that if the source directory in the NFS request does not exist, you get a \"permission denied\" instead of the more intuitive \"directory does not exist\".\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't read hard drive after booting in windows 8 I have a dual boot Ubuntu / Windows 8 system.

I did a scan/clean with Disk Utility and it says the disk is fine.\nJames\n\nA: This may happen if you hibernate the windows system. Try accessing the hard drive again from windows and see if that is possible. If yes do a complete reboot and then try to access the drive from ubuntu.\nIf that also does not do it, try accessing the disk with superuser access (be a bit careful here though)\n\nA: \nMy secondary hard drive I keep all my data, and I booted into windows, changed one file, shut down, booted back into Ubuntu, and now I can't access anything on the hard drive.\n\nI assume that means you have atleast 3 partitions or drives and you don't want to access the Windows drive itself (see Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation), but 3rd partition where you have no operating system installed and only store data.\nIf that is an NTFS filesystem then you should run chkdsk in Windows.\nSimilar question: Why does my NTFS partition mount as read only?\n", "Q: How to start Viber on system boot?

I have AMD radeon graphics card, I faced a lot of problems with graphics drivers from nvidia (like unresponsive black screen) already. \nCan someone please suggest which drivers to use without any problems and how to check which drivers are currently installed?\nThank you\n\nA: Ubuntu has built-in open source graphics drivers installed by default. If you install a proprietary graphics driver, you can have both the open source graphics driver and the proprietary graphics driver installed at the same time, and the operating system will use the proprietary driver instead of the open source graphics driver.  \nIf you have an AMD Radeon graphics card, you should not be using an NVIDIA graphics driver. You should use one of the ATI binary X.Org drivers from the default Ubuntu repositories. These are the video drivers for the AMD Radeon and FireGL graphics accelerators.\nThere are several different ATI binary X.Org drivers to choose from in the Ubuntu Software Center. To identify the recommended proprietary graphics driver for your hardware open the terminal and type: \nubuntu-drivers devices\n\nWait for a minute or two for the command to scan your computer's hardware. The results should identify the recommended proprietary graphics driver for your computer. Install the recommended proprietary graphics driver using sudo apt install recommended-driver where instead of recommended-driver substitute the package name of the recommended proprietary graphics driver.

Both repairs led to the same result.\n\nA: By \"keep my files\" are you referring to everything in your home folder? If you backed up / copied your home folder somewhere else, then you could do a (fresh) re-install from the live usb, and once it's up & running then create your user again (adduser or useradd) copy your home folder back and be up & running again.

It's easy to use, you never have to delete those uppercase characters when you don't need them. Just by pressing Shift to start the sentence with an uppercase character, you \"automatically\" deactivate CapsLock.\nHere are the instructions for Linux Mint:\nGo to System Settings > Keyboard.\nNext, choose your keyboard layout, then click Options...\nUnder \"Miscellaneous compatibility options\", check the box next to \"Both Shift keys together activate Caps Lock, one Shift key deactivates\".\nI have no Ubuntu available to test, but hopefully the instructions are equally valid.\n\nA: You can do it the same way, just try it.

But there's a couple of characters that isn't on the list. \nCharacters like an X with a line on top of it. Kind of an x with underscore but opposite.\nIs there something that I can do to add new special characters in libre office?\nany thoughts?\n\nA: A symbol such as an x (lowercase or uppercase) with a line on top of it does not exist as a coded character in Unicode (or any other character code standard). This is why you cannot find it in character pallettes.\nHowever, you can enter such a symbol using a normal letter followed by a combining diacritic mark, which could be U+0304 COMBINING MACRON or U+0305 COMBINING OVERLINE. I have to check my own e-book to see which one is better... yep, overline is generally preferable here, since it is more noticeable (longer). Besides, macron is originally intended for use in linguistics (to indicate long vowel, typically), rather than part of a mathematical notation. But this may also depend on the font used, in practice.\nThe following image shows the letter x, in italic, with macron, then with overline, and then, for comparison, a formula constructed as suggested in @Rishabh’s answer.\n\nYou can enter a combining diacritic mark (which is always entered after the base character it should apply to) in LibreOffice using Insert → Special character, check selecting “Combining Diacritical Marks” in the “Subset” menu and proceeding as usual. When you click on a character in the pallette, you will see the Unicode number (like U+0305) on the right. This is important because the characters are often difficult to distinguish.\n\n\nA: In LibreOffice Writer:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Insert → Object → Ole Object\n\n*Select Create New LibreOffice Formula\n\n*Write bar{x}.\n\nThis will insert x bar into it; you can add other symbols (closely related to how LaTeX does it).\nLibreOffice Calc and Impress also provide similar options.\n\nA: Old but relevant. I would suggest the use of autocorrect option. Here's how:\n\n\nA: I think the special characters available depends on the font being used - e.g:\n\n\nSo you could look for a font that has this character available \n\nA: I find a way to get x-bar in LibreOfiice Calc without creating a formula but using symbol.\nFor lowercase x-bar: Type x in a cell, then Insert/Special Character/ U+305\nFor uppercase X-bar: The bar will overlap letter X if we use the same step above. So this is my workaround: type lowercase x-bar then formatting it to uppercase.

When I open a site which requires flash plugin (e.g. Youtube), Firefox says This plugin is vulnerable and should be updated.\n\nHowever if I click Check for updates... there is no update at all. This is what the update site listed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202 (status up to date 11.2.202.424)\n\n*Java(TM) Plug-in 11.25.2 (status up to date 11.25.2)\n\n\nSo what should I do?\n\nA: The best solution to the problem of a vulnerable, out-of-date Flash installation--or even an up-to-date one that works poorly--may be to uninstall Flash entirely. Often it is not needed, as HTML5 has largely taken over. Thus removing Flash is a real solution for many people, and should probably be considered first before moving on to other solutions that attempt to keep Flash installed while maintaining it in a current (or semi-current) state.\nAs occupyflash.org says:\n\nFlash Player is dead. Its time has passed. It's buggy. It crashes a lot. It requires constant security updates. It doesn't work on most\n  mobile devices. It's a fossil, left over from the era of closed\n  standards and unilateral corporate control of web technology. Websites\n  that rely on Flash present a completely inconsistent (and often\n  unusable) experience for fast-growing percentage of the users who\n  don't use a desktop browser. It introduces some scary security and\n  privacy issues by way of Flash cookies.\nFlash makes the web less accessible.

On 12.04 LTS x64, I changed my user password via the User Accnts tool. After that I was unable to login again with my new password since my home directory is encrypted and the above-described bug does not allow decryption of the home directory with the new login password. \nThe passphrase to decrypt the home directory is saved in a folder on my encrypted home directory. \nIs there any way to recover this passphrase and unlock my home directory? \nDo not have separate record of the decryption passphrase. I still have a functioning Guest Account to which I have access, but I am not clear whether I can somehow gain access to the files in my encrypted user home directory while logged in as Guest and without having the decrypt passphrase. Please advise asap.\n\nA: If you're using ecryptfs (it's the standard way to encrypt home folders, so probably are) then when you changed your user password you lost automatic access to your encrypted home (as you discovered). That should not have happened with most regular ways to change your password (like passwd), they're supposed to use PAM to update the encryption automatically (but not if an administrator changes/resets the password, or it wouldn't be secure).\necryptfs actually recommends that you keep a backup copy of the actual passphrase it uses (it's not your login passphrase, but it is encrypted or \"wrapped\" with your login passphrase) just in case something happens to the wrapped passphrase file you're referring to.\nBut using ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase you should be able to find out the actual ecryptfs passphrase.\nUsing ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase you could use your old user passphrase to \"unwrap\" the ecryptfs passphrase, then \"re-wrap\" it it with your new user passphrase. Here's a clip from it's man page:\nNAME\n   ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase - unwrap an eCryptfs wrapped passphrase, re‐\n   wrap it with a new passphrase, and write it back to file.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n   ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase [file]\n\n   printf \"%s\\n%s\" \"old wrapping passphrase\" \"new wrapping  passphrase\"  |\n   ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase [file] -\n\nBut I'd make a backup copy of any files before running that on them. (ps. you don't need to use the printf... format, it works just running ecryptfs-rewrap-passphrase [file] if you don't mind typing the passphrases).\nAnd you could run ecryptfs-recover-private to just mount any ecryptfs encrypted private folders it finds, then backup/copy, etc. \nSee man ecryptfs and the man pages for all the ecryptfs-... tools for some more info.

Private data mounted at [/tmp/ecryptfs.1x34gL7R].\n\nmint@mint /tmp $ gksu nemo  [<---- NOTE THAT I HAVE OPENED TERMINAL IN THE TEMP FOLDER of the LIVE CD NOW]\n\nVia the Nemo file browser (I believe it is Nautilus in Ubuntu) I navigated to the NEWLY PLACED folder named ecryptfs.1x34gL7R (in the LIVE CD's TEMP FOLDER), and from there, right click on the folder, and select \"Open as root\".\nRight away, without any further password challenges, I accessed my hitherto inaccessible Home directory.\nI don't see any other way to recover data at my aptitude level. \nThere is a seeming alternative route using ecryptfs that requires your user password, but it ALWAYS rejects the password that you enter - ALWAYS. Even given that your actual Mint password is correct, and the Live CD has no password for root. I wish I could remember which route I'm talking about here, but basically, it's the one that always rejects your password. Forget that.\nIf you cannot get anywhere with the method I've shown, then maybe you've forgotten your own login password (unlikely), or that your encryption key has become corrupted (through hard drive failure OR if you've removed gvfs - never touch gvfs - some troll on the Internet has said it's a security risk and given instructions on how to remove it, but this will completely destroy your system).\nIf you cannot access your encrypted drive, then you can at least copy the encrypted folder from the Live Disc tmp folder to your backup drive VIA TERMINAL (for example, cp -a /source/. /dest/   OR maybe it was  cp -a ~/source/. ~/dest/  ), and then take it to an expert to decrypt it, at some indefinite later date.\nNow that you can see your files again, you have a new problem - you cannot actually move anything out of the browser window. However, you can at least open individual files (text, word processor, and picture files) and select to save them onto your new location (e.g. a backup drive). \nFinally, I'm sorry Ubuntu and Mint programmers (yes that's me and you) etc. etc. - but Linux needs to improve to be user friendly in the case of data recovery. If the data exists, and the user full-well knows his password, then the data recovery process should be more streamlined! \nP.S. remember: it's ecryptfs NOT encryptfs, and remember that a Live CD most likely uses a default American keyboard character set, so change the way you enter your login password accordingly, e.g. if your password uses special characters.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu and encrypted Windows 7 I have a work laptop with Windows 7 installed using Check Point Full Disk Encryption. The HDD was dying, so I installed a larger SSD and copied the contents of the old HDD over to it using dd. So far so good - Windows loads correctly, and tells me it's living on a 320GB partition of a 480GB drive.\nNow I thought I'd try to be clever. I wanted to try out Ubuntu on this machine as well. I already had an Ubuntu installation on a 120GB external drive, so I copied this onto the unused partition of my new drive (again using dd). Using a Live USB image, I can see that this has worked - the files are all there. I followed the instructions here to set up GRUB2. But it boots into the GRUB 'rescue prompt' and won't let me boot into Windows or Ubuntu. I guess I've overwritten the MBR, where the encryption software resides. I can restore this from the original HDD. So how do I set up GRUB to allow me to boot (encrypted) Windows or Ubuntu?\n\nA: First you may want to make a backup of those (pretty sure you said you did, but just double checking). Next, you can try to disable the encryption, install grub, then re-encrypt the Windows partition. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't use grub. What should you use I hear you ask? There are two options, you can either press your boot key and move to the Ubuntu partition, or you can add a MBR within Windows. There are tools that allow you to do so, that way you have Windows handle the boot process in order to boot into Ubuntu rather than grub handle where to boot. \n", "Q: Unity tweak tool devices issue In the unity tweak tool, under desktop icons, there are options to make home folder, network, trash and devices appear on the desktop.

I configured MEEP with the following command:\n./configure --with-mpi --with-hdf5=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/  > configure.out\n\nI then ran make which resulted in error and I could not run make install afterwards. Without specifying the --with-hdf5 flag the configuration script used to return a warning as follows:\nconfigure: WARNING: Couldn't find the HDF5 library!! Switching to ...\n\nAfter installing numerous HDF5 libraries the problem was magically resolved; however, it was still present when I used the flag --with-hdf5=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/. But without the flag everything installed flawlessly(I tested the program afterwards and confirmed that it was running as expected.) except the GNU Scientific Library linkage. My questions are as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*How the location of the library can be located from the command prompt? Is executing the command locate hdf5 in the case of HDF5 and the finding the path of files ending with .so, .a enough?\n\n*How could the GNU Scientific Library be introduced to the configuration and make scripts?\n\n*Do the environmental variables LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LD_LIBRARY_PATH have anything to do with the configuration and make scripts recognizing these libraries. I think they have since they are mentioned in MEEP install instructions and MEEP install tutorial. I would appreciate it if someone can explain how these and the LIB variable are related with installation procedures.\n\n\nThanks for taking your time,\nP.S: If required I can supply additional documents. I did not put the configuration script etc. since I do not know which one is automatically generated and which one is not(same goes for make).\n\nA: To answer this question well really requires a thorough understanding of GNU autotools, which I don't have: nevertheless I hope these comments will help.\nThe configure script for a particular build is generated from its configure.ac file using autoconf. In turn, configure.ac uses standard macros to test for the presence of specified components. In this particular case, configure.ac specifies an AC_CHECK_LIB test for the GSL library as\n  AC_CHECK_LIB(gsl, gsl_sf_bessel_Jn, [],\n        [AC_MSG_WARN([Missing GNU GSL library...Bessel-function field initialization will not be supported.])])\n\nThe syntax of an AC_CHECK_LIB is\nAC_CHECK_LIB (library, function, [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found], [other-libraries])\n\nand the actual mechanism by which the check is performed is by creating a minimal test program (conftest) for the specified function gsl_sf_bessel_Jn in library libgsl, and attempting to link it using the default build tools. Such a minimal program might look something like\nchar gsl_sf_bessel_Jn();\n\nint main() { return gsl_sf_bessel_Jn(); return 0; }\n\nNote that the dummy prototype char gsl_sf_bessel_Jn() may bear no relation to the return type or argument list of the actual function - we never attempt to run the program, we just wish to know whether it links (i.e. whether the linker is able to resolve library references). We can see how this works if we create such a source file ourselves:\n$ cat > conftest.c\nchar gsl_sf_bessel_Jn();\n\nint main() { return gsl_sf_bessel_Jn(); return 0; }\n\nCtrl+D\nAs expected, if we try to run it without linking the GSL library, we get an error\n$ gcc conftest.c\n/tmp/ccWqFraS.o: In function `main':\nconftest.c:(.text+0xa): undefined reference to `gsl_sf_bessel_Jn'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nHowever even if we explicitly link libgsl we find\n$ gcc conftest.c -lgsl\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/../../../../lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to `cblas_dasum'\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/../../../../lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to `cblas_sger'\n.\n<snip>\n.\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/../../../../lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to `cblas_zdotu_sub'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nAt this point, it's important to note that the configure script doesn't know why a particular test has failed, only that it has. In this case, it has failed because we didn't link the subordinate libgslcblas library. \nThis illustrates the importance of the order in which tests are performed: each successful test causes the newly discovered library to be added to the $LIB variable for subsequent tests. Specifically (as noted in the GSL documentation)\n\nIt is important to check for libm and libgslcblas before libgsl,\n  otherwise the tests will fail.

How could I bring back the driver of the original wifi function? Does that influence the ath10k driver what I need to deal with? Can the two drivers,two functions just coexist?\nthanks in advance!\nDave\n\nA: Backports installs the networking drivers from a newer kernel, 3.16, for example, into an earlier kernel, in your case 3.13. Since you can select which drivers to install and not install all the wireless drivers that you don't need, 'defconfig ath10k', if you have two devices, you run the risk of installing conflicting cfg80211 and mac80211 pieces, as you have found!\nYou might try also installing the driver for your existing device from the same backports package and see if it helps.\nAlso, Network Manager will generally allow one connection or the other, not both.\n", "Q: Can't see certain wireless networks I'm having issues seeing specific WiFi networks.

My app was just reviewed and the feedback comments mentioned \"policy_version_is_highest\". What does this mean?\n\nA: We always require the highest security policy version.

I uploaded my app to the store but received this error message:\nfound unexpected Exec with architecture 'all': ./qtcdevicedebughelper.py\n (REJECT) reserved policy group 'debug': not for production use\nWhat does it mean?\n\nA: Rejected because you uploaded a debug build of your app. Debug builds are made to test your app on devices and emulators; to upload to the store, you need to create a release build. The Publish tab in Ubuntu SDK lets you create a release build click package; increase your version number and then create a release build click package from the Publish tab and then upload it to successfully publish to the store.\nThis is probably because you uploaded the run-on-the-emulator click package, rather than using the Publish tab in Ubuntu SDK to make a proper release build and uploading that.\n", "Q: Search csv file column Is there a way to search the content of a specific column of a csv file using the terminal.

I would like to install Lubuntu on my Acer Aspire 1310 laptop. I have done a little bit of research and it looks like the newest version which runs on such old laptop is Lubuntu 11.10 and the only way of installing it is through minimal CD installation procedure. I have tried, and indeed versions 12.04 and 14.04 didn't work, while version 10.04 has installed successfully.\nNow I would like to perform a fresh installation of Lubuntu 11.10, but I can't find the minimal CD for it. Where can I get the minimal CD ISO for Lubuntu 11.10?\n\nA: All flavors of Ubuntu 11.10, including Lubuntu, have been 'end-of-lifed', which means they are not supported anymore so I do not think you will be able to find a download for it, but even if you do, I strongly suggest not to install it, for it will not receive important security updates. For more version info, here is a great site: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases.\nHope this helped!\n", "Q: Not enough space on disk in ubuntu 14.04 i am using ubuntu 14.04, and I got a message saying \"not enough space on disc\" (or something like that). The problem is that I;m trying to get into ubuntu and delete some files that I don't need (in order to free some space), but after I write my password in the login screen, nothing happens. Maybe Ubuntu can't open because there is so few space left? So, my question is:\nHow can I access and delete files from ubuntu partition without being inside ubuntu, but from my Windows 8.1 partition (I have a dual boot of Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04).\n\nA: Windows can not mount linux partitions.\nYou can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a live CD/USB\n\n*Boot from live CD/USB\n\n*Mount hard disk partition\n\n*Delete the files\n\n*Reboot from hard disk\n\n\nYou can find description on how to create a live USB here.\n\nA: If you are able to get to the login screen then you should be able to access the TTY command line by pressing Ctrl+Alt++F1 on your keyboard. From here enter your username and password to login to the TTY terminal.\nNow you can access your filesystem using ls -al to see the files and folders in your current path and the cd directoryname to navigate to a different directory. From here you can issue commands such as rm filename to delete a file or rm -r directoryname to recursively delete every file and folder in the specified directory.\nNote: The rm commands can be very dangerous as they will outright delete the file/directories you specify and once they are deleted they cannot be recovered so be very careful which files/directories to select for deletion while using these commands.\nAfter you've finished deleting the files you want to remove press Ctrl+Alt++F7 to exit the TTY and continue to the login screen.\n", "Q: How to setup Chromecast as second display? I'm using Chromecast with Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm able to mirror my desktop using Chromium + Google Cast Addon. \nI am wondering if it's possible to extend my desktop as if chromecast was a second monitor.\n\nA: Got it partially working for a single window:\n\n\n*\n\n*setup a virtual display:\n# 1. show current display information \n#    and extract the name of your primary display (e.g.: eDP1)\nxrandr --query\n# 2. create virtual display\nxrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1600x1024\n# 3. add virtual display, change eDP1 to your primary display\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1600x1024 --left-of eDP1\n\n\n*Bring up chrome and the application you want to be displayed on the TV\n\n*Move both windows to the virtual display\n\n*Configure Chrome to cast the application-window to the chromecast (I used Teamviewer to control the virtual display)\n\n\nThe problem:\nI was not able to configure chrome to cast the full virtual screen, because chrome only allowed me to cast all screens at once, this included both: the primary and the virtual display contents.\nWorkaround:\nI'm now using Teamviewer to mirror the virtual display to my Android device, which uses Miracast to mirror to the TV.\n\nA: Chromecast a tab, then separate the tab into a new Chrome window (drag it out).  Go back to the original Chrome window.  Now, you've got a virtual second screen.  Not sure if that's what you were looking for, but that's what I came up with to get my second screen.  It works for what I was trying to do -- see two screens.\n\nA: Watch this vide: Chromecast as second monitor on windows\nThe idea is the same, you need to first force a \"fake\" extension screen on Ubuntu. And then you can easily cast to it.\nI don't remember how I used to create a fake screen to push the extension screen on it although the OS may not recognize it. I will find it and edit this post.\n\nA: Sorry for digging up this old question, but today I've finally found a solution which isn't perfect, but which allows not to change his configuration.\n(Of course you need to have Chromium Browser installed first, to be able to cast)\n1-Install Xnest\nsudo apt-get install xnest\n\n2-Run Xnest from a terminal (the resolution 800x600 is given as an example, it could be changed)\nXnest -geometry 800x600 :2\n\nA new black window opens.\n3-Open a new terminal, and enter the command:\nexport DISPLAY=:2\n\n4-In the same terminal, launch Chromium Browser\nchromium-browser\n\nChromium opens in the Xnest window\n5-From chromium, cast the screen\n6-Open a new terminal, and run the command\nexport DISPLAY=:2\n\n7-From this terminal, launch the app you wish to cast, for example LibreOffice, evince, eye of gnome... and it will launch in Xnest window.\nFor more convenience, at this step it's even possible to launch a complete desktop environment; I've installed lxde + lxsession on my machine and it works perfectly (warning: unlike in a virtual machine, such a \"sub-environment\" has direct action on the whole computer, for example if you shut it down, you computer will kill your main session and shut down!)\nIt's not exactly a screen extension, but it is very near.\n", "Q: Das Keyboard 4 keyboard professional Has anyone encountered any problems / issues with the new Das Keyboard 4 Professional keyboard?

I've found out how to set and restore the normal standard shortcuts using gconftool-2 (and navigatable via gconf-editor).\nI've also seen that apparently custom keyboard shortcuts are stored in dconf, though I'm skeptical.\nIn attempting to use dconf to write and read the settings, it doesn't seem like the tool is updating the same setting. Can anyone help me find and update these custom keyboard shortcuts?\nWhat I tried in dconf:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set the shortcut:\ndconf write '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0' \"'<Primary><Alt>p'\"\n\n*I checked by opening up the unity dash, and going to 'keyboard' and 'keyboard shortcuts'. It didn't seem to be set.\n\n*Then I set my own shutcut on \"custom0\" to see if I used the wrong syntax. I set and cleared several times and called:\ndconf read '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0'\n\n*Even though other keyboard shortcuts are set, custom0 was the only one that returned values.\n\n\n\nContext:\nI'm trying to swap between pianobar and banshee multi-media keys. I found out about pianobar ctl's socket used for sending keyboard shortcuts. I switch between sometimes and it's tedious to open up the keyboard shortcuts each time to update them.

I was recently gifted a Samsung Chromebook. I want to completely delete Chrome OS and make Ubuntu 14.04.1 my main operating system.\nWhen I upgraded 12.04 to 14.04.1 from a standard download, as usual I had to restart my computer, but when I shut down Ubuntu all it does is shut down Ubuntu 14.04.1 and take me back to Chrome OS. Then I have to open a Chrome OS terminal via Crtl+Alt+T and type shell then enter. And to get into Ubuntu I have to type sudo startunity. This used to work, but now when I do it I get this:\nWelcome to crosh, the Chrome OS developer shell.\n\nIf you got here by mistake, don't panic!

As for completely getting rid of Chrome OS, I would look into Chrubuntu. It allows you to dual boot Chrome OS and Ubuntu, allowing you to specify the hard disk space for each. You also have the option of installing any other Linux variant via a bootable USB stick. In addition, newer chromebooks have the option to boot via SEABios, allowing you to use the full Linux kernel and not the one provided by Chrome OS, so investigating this further would definitely be worth your while. \n\nA: Updating messes up the chroot on the chromebook. It thinks its loading precise, but then you updated to Ubuntu 14.04, so precise does not exist anymore on your chromebook. If you don't mind going out and back in dev mode, then do it. But if you do mind, run \"sudo delete-chroot precise\".\n", "Q: Can swap be on a different disk? I have 16GB of RAM and the core system is run on 128GB sddisk.

Add it to your fstab to make it available on boot.\nFor help with making the swap partition: How do I restore a swap partition I accidentally deleted?\nFor help with turning swap on: You literally just type sudo swapon into a terminal\nFor help with adding to your fstab: How do I add a swap partition after system installation?\n\nA: Since you have 16GB of RAM, there is no need for a 'swap' partition. Also, the 'swap should be 1-2 times the RAM' rule is only valid for systems having less RAM, ie < 2GB.\nYou can create a swap partition on a separate drive by using mkswap and swapon.\nEg - To to migrate swap from /dev/sdc3 to /dev/sdb1 -\nswapoff /dev/sdc3\nmkswap /dev/sdb1\nswapon /dev/sdb1\nand edit swap entry in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: Why can't root access my CIFS mounts?

Although Im sure its not a monitor issue, because if I display the screen only on the monitor it looks fine.\nAny idea?\n\n\nA: Check running the below command from your terminal window and see whether this helps,\nResetting an out-of-range resolution\nrm ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\nYou can direct xrandr to set a different resolution like this:\n$ xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1024x768\n$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: I have to same problem too.\nIt seems to happen after the latest Nvidia update.\nAnyhow I tried the following and that worked for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Nvidia control panel (e.g Nvidia X server setting)\n\n*Go to PRIME Profiles tab and select \"Intel(Power saving mode)\" instead of NVIDIA(Performance Mode).\n\n\nI don't really understand what was happening, hope something ask give us a better answer.\n\nA: The standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.

Bugs go to Launchpad.\nAccording to the answer on this question:\n\nYou can set a custom crash database in the package-hook for your package.

The Launchpad API doesn't provide a mapping for branch contents or history.\nYou can get the diff for a specific set of revisions via bzrlib though. This is how Launchpad generates the diff contents for Merge Proposals. You don't need to clone a local copy of the branch to read it; bzrlib supports reading from remote branches.

Only issue is that I have a dual booted system with Win7, and when I tried to install the Ubuntu alongside with win7 it would not give me the option for encryption unless I wiped my existing windows partition. Is there a way to encrypt both partitions together after both have install, and still to use the GRUB to switch between the OS's on boot?? \n\nA: If your windows 7 running with Enterprise/Ultimate you can use Bitlocker to encrpyt it and for Ubuntu you can use LUKS,\n", "Q: piping in real time This is more a conceptual thing than a current problem.\nWould it be possible to do this:\ntail -f <file> | grep \"string\" | sed 's/stuff//g' >> output.txt\nThe problem I'm thinking is that tail -f never terminates so it won't progress in the command. I'm trying to read and output a file in real-time. If this doesn't work how would I do it?\n\nA: Most commands that output data on stdout, (which includes grep and sed,) buffer their output when it's not going to a terminal. That is, they wait for a large chunk of output to gather (like 4KiB) before flushing the chunk to the file or pipe. This is generally more efficient. Some commands allow you to override this, like GNU grep which has a --line-buffered option, and GNU sed has an --unbuffered option. For commands that don't have a way to override the buffering, you can use tools like unbuffer or stdbuf.\nIn this case though, I'd consider using GNU awk instead, where you can control the flushing of stdout yourself (with the fflush function).\ntail -f file | gawk '/string/{ gsub(/stuff/, \"\") } { print; fflush() }' > output.txt\n\nSee BashFAQ #9 for more on buffering.\n", "Q: Updating from Ubuntu 13.04 to 14.10 with no XP I want to update my incredibly trustworthy Ubuntu 13.04 , I have never had a problem with it even though its unsupported.

GNOME Fallback has NO Activities menu thats why you have no hot corners or Superkey functions. GNOME Fallback is GNOME 2's panel ported to GNOME 3.\nIt seems that your trying to install GNOME Shell (or Classic which comes bundled with GNOME Shell) rather than GNOME Fallback which you can find a tutorial here\n\nA: if you installed GNOME with your tutorial because you like the fallback-mode (the similarity to the old GNOME 2) and want to stick with a traditional desktop, you should definitively try MATE!\nand yes: the super key is working in MATE like in Windows...! ;-)\n", "Q: What partitions can I share between different flavors of Ubuntu I want to play with some of the different flavors of Ubuntu, i.e. Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.  I know I can share /home.  However, can I share /usr, /boot, or even /bin and /var. So that all flavors are working with the same programs and settings as much as possible.\n\nA: Different Ubuntu flavours are mostly Ubuntu with different desktop environments.\nTo try different desktop environments it is not necessary to have separate Ubuntu installations.

Here goes.\nI'm still setting up a LiveUSB copy of Ubuntu with some new apps, but I can't get many of them to work. . . Scratch that, I haven't installed any at all yet. \nThe first thing I did was download a DEB copy of Atom.IO from the internet. It's a port of a really nice text editor that I use for HTML and CSS. However, when I open it, the Software Center opens up instead. Guessing that I'm supposed to hit \"install\", I do the obvious, but nothing happens other than the little animation. I click, it sinks in, it pops out again, nothing changed. Huh. There's also an RPM package, but I'm not sure what to do with that but that's another question... Anyway, I tried to get Chrome, but the exact same thing happened. \nI also tried to download WINE from the 'Center, because it's supposed to emulate Windows software (right?), but I have a similar problem. I get a \"Use this source\" button that does nothing. I'm kinda frustrated by this.\nWhat am I supposed to do? Am I doing something wrong, or missing something?\n\nA: You can install downloaded deb packages using dpkg. \nIn fact, the software center acts as a front-end to dpkg while installing deb packages.\nTo install, type the command - \nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb\nwhere 'file' is the name of the deb package. \n", "Q: CRON @reboot vncserver?

However the main problem is that Dropbox indicator is located on the left, above the Dash icon.\n\nI searched for solutions on the web, but didn't find anything. Does anyone have some suggestions?\n\nA: Coincidentally, I just ran into the same issue. It seems to be a bug, because restarting Dropbox fixes it temporarily, but only until the next restart. To fix it permanently, we need to edit and rename the dropbox.desktop file in ~/.config/autostart/\nHow to fix it permanently:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename the file ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop into: start_dropbox.desktop\n[You need to rename it because Dropbox overwrites the file dropbox.desktop on every startup]\n\n*Open the (renamed) file with gedit (drag it over an open gedit window).\n\n*Replace the line, starting with Exec=, change it into:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&dropbox start -i\"\n\nThis delays the startup of Dropbox with 10 seconds after log-in, which does the trick.\n\n*in Dropbox preferences, untick \"Start Dropbox on startup\" (else we would have two .desktop files representing Dropbox in the autostart folder):\n\n\n*In Startup Applications (Dash > Startup Applications) remove the Dropbox entry (but not the newly created start_dropbox.desktop).\n\n\n*In the folder ~/.config/autostart, remove the original dropbox.desktop if it is still there.\n\n\nNow on restart, it should be in the right place.\nExplanation\nThe bug seems to be related to the timing of the Dropbox startup. The workaround above replaces the \"real\" Dropbox starter with one that delays the startup 10 seconds, until the desktop is ready.\n\nA: I followed the directions in the accepted answer but it didn't help in my case (I'm also using Unity on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS). Interestingly, I also had somehow lost the Wifi indicator, and following a fix for that issue, found here:\nNo wi-fi icon/ option in Ubuntu 14.04\n..also fixed the placement of the Dropbox icon.\n", "Q: Standalone Flash Pepper on 14.04? Is there a Standalone Flash Pepper version available out there?\nOr would it be possible to execute the chrome plugin without running chrome?\nThanks :-)\n\nA: As far as I could tell (and I scoured Google to try and find an answer for this, and didn't find one even 15 pages in), there is no standalone runtime / projector / player for Pepper Flash.\nHowever, as an alternative, you could use the Flash 15 Standalone Player executable for Windows(AppDB Entry) (or even the Flash 16 beta Standalone Player executable for Windows(AppDB Entry)) within Wine.  I have tested this (on both of them), and it seems to work smoothly and without issues.  In fact, I've noticed it runs FAR smoother than Firefox or Chrome's flash plugins does.  It is a usable alternative until there is a Pepper Flash standalone (if there ever is, as all I could find was Pepper Flash is provided by Adobe to Google under license.)\nAdobe also made a Flash 11 standalone player for Linux, but it is still Flash 11, and it is really buggy and crashed for me every time I tried to use it in Ubuntu 14.04.  That's why I went the \"Windows Standalone Flash Inside of Wine\" route, which seems to work.\n\n\nNOTE: Yes, the links don't work - it's too hard to play catchup every time Flash updates.  Use this link always to find the 'latest' versions that Adobe makes available.\n\n\nA: You may want to try something like pipelight\n\n     sudo apt-get install pipelight\n\n\n     pipelight-plugin --enable flash\n\nThis has the advantage of also supporting unity3d and silverlight if you enable them, and should be up to date, as it runs flash through wine.\n", "Q: \"[drm:intel_dp_complete_link_train] *ERROR* failed to train DP, aborting\" I've just installed Ubuntu 14.04 server on Dell Latitude E7440 and then installed Cinnamon 2.4.5 on top of it.

Translations are mostly done by volunteers, and if you have an interest in improving the situation for your language, please let your translation team know.\nThe problem you describe has nothing to do with which language you select at installation.

These errors also usually disappear on a refetch.\nIt seems reasonable to assume these are all a symptom of one problem and that this problem has something to do with an interaction between chromium and my specific system (otherwise everyone would have the issue).\nHowever, I'm not aware of any system changes other than regular updates that could affect this. Firefox works fine, although it does seem rather slow.\nI've googled extensively and this issue does seem to affect other people but none of the proposed solutions worked for me:\nI've made sure that I'm not getting dropouts and that I'm not using any firewall software.\nI've purged and re-installed chromium, including the deletion of all of the local information under .config.\nI set 'chromium-browser --no-proxy-server'\nI only have a single wired ethernet connection.\nI don't want to switch back to firefox because I've found chromium faster and I prefer its developer tools.\nCan anyone help me fix or diagnose the problem?\n\nA: There is an offline Chrome Web Store* app you can use to investigate wireless issues called Chrome Connectivity Diagnostics. I would recommend installing that and running it when you encounter issues to see what suggestions it can offer.\n* Yes, you can install Chrome Web Store apps in Chromium, too.\n", "Q: Why do I get a black/purple screen when booting on a brand new PC build? So I am quite new to Linux/Ubuntu, and while searching for parts and building my new PC myself, i decided i wanted to cut some costs by installing Linux instead of Windows. I have the PC all put together, everything runs fine and i can boot up to the BIOS menu easily. I have downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS onto my USB flash drive using pendrivelinux.com and have attempted to boot up and install Linux multiple times. But everytime I try to install Linux or try Linux without installing, the monitor shows a loading screen and then goes to a purple screen (or a black screen when I use my TV as a monitor). The onboard video is already disabled to my knowledge. I do not have any other operating system installed on my build and am trying to make Ubuntu the native OS.\nMy build includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*MSI 970A-G43 ATX AM3+ Motherboard\n\n*AMD FX-6300 3.5GHz 6-Core Processor\n\n*G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory\n\n*Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\n\n*MSI R9 270X Gaming 4G\n\n*NZXT Source 210 Elite (White) ATX Mid Tower Case\n\n*Corsair CX 500W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n\nA: After playing and searching around, I found that I could enter the GRUB menu by holding down F11, then pressing \"e\" on \"install ubuntu\" i then looked for where it said \"quick splash --\" and changed it to \"nomodeset $vt_handoff\" this allowed my system to boot it all up and after installing I played around with the /etc/default/grub file and changed around some text to allow my system to boot up  right to Ubuntu.\n\nA: This is probably due to your graphics card not being compatible with Ubuntu right out of the box.  Try removing your graphics card and running on off the integrated graphics to see if that’s the problem.  Also make sure your usb drive is prepared with AMD64 Ubuntu not Intel x86 Ubuntu.\nThe problem is that you would need to have some sort of display port on your mobo to install Ubuntu with integrated graphics, then fix the problem with graphics card. Many people online have the same problem as you have, but they have installed Ubuntu on the without the graphics card. Just look up 270x in ubuntu and see what you get. This sounds very frustrating and hope it's resolved soon.\n", "Q: Need to free space in /boot to update. don't see duplicate kernels... HELP!

And then remove them using: sudo apt-get remove --purge .... Just remember to exclude the latest and the currently running one in case something goes wrong (Use uname to find out).\nYou can also use sudo apt-get autoremove --purge, it automatically figures out which packages aren't needed anymore. Just remember to check all the important features are working correctly before removing older kernels.\n", "Q: How to Install Oculus SDK 0.4.4 and run something on DK2 I am new to Linux altogether, as well as the Oculus Rift.\nI have got my DK2 to work on Windows laptop, so I know it is functional.\nI just built a new PC and decided to run Ubuntu 14.04 and see how the \"rift\" works on it. I downloaded the newest Oculus SDK for Linux, 0.4.4, from here, released a couple weeks ago. My question is probably simple for most of you, what do I do now? \nI ran \"oculusd\" and plugged in my HDMI and it was displaying the desktop, so it is connecting and working but how do I go about playing games? is it automatically in 'extended mode'? The read-me file was little help as I'm sure it's referring to a lot of Linux specifics that I'm unfamiliar with. I noticed the configuration tool doesn't even have a button for the demo (like it does in windows).\n\nA: The world demo button in RiftConfigUtil will be grayed out initially until a user profile is created.  Click the button labelled '+' and fill out your info first.\nAssuming you have an Nvidia card, the easiest way to modify your display settings is with the nvidia-settings program that is installed along with the proprietary nvidia drivers. In order to get full framerate and no \"judder\", you really need a new/beefy gaming video card.\nI have only been able to get 75 hz refresh when setting the rift as another X11 display 'X Screen 1'.  My monitors are only capable of 60Hz which might be limiting framerate when not using two explicit X11 screens. eg, :0.0 and :0.1.  Make sure to leave the Rift in vertical/portrait non-rotated mode for best performance.\nYou can then run oculusd on the second display via:\nDISPLAY=:0.1 ./oculusd\nLaunch the world demo in the same way after compiling it:\nDISPLAY=:0.1 Release/OculusWorldDemo_x86_64_Release\nF9 will then put the Tuscany demo into fullscreen and rotated properly. I hope you get it working.\nAnd now for the bad news... there aren't many games being released for Linux+Oculus currently.  I'm hopeful either Steam or some open source games will start supporting it soon.\n", "Q: After updates in 14.04 boots to black screen I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 on a VirtualBox and I've done updates to the Ubuntu install today.

I'm a brand new user so I'm not sure of my way around the system yet. I want to change my computer's name, so I tried to edit the name in /etc/hostname, but it is a read-only file. Adding the ! character didn't help. I'm using vim to edit the file.\n\nA: Very Short Answer:\nYou can modify a file (even if it's read-only) if you own it.\nShort Answer:\nEven if the user which you are logged in as (in this case navid) has administrative privileges, you won't be able to modify /etc/hostname, because the root user owns that file. Consequently, you should log in as the root user.\nLong Answer\nAssuming that you want to change your computer name from oldName to newName, here are the steps that you should follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as the root user:\nnavid@oldName:~$ sudo su -\n\n\n*Open hostname:\nroot@oldName:~# vi /etc/hostname\n\n\n*You will see oldName. Press i to go to the insert mode then change it to newName. Then press  Esc + : + w + q + Enter to save and exit.\n\n*Open hosts:\nroot@oldName:~# vi /etc/hosts\n\nThe top 2 lines look like this:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.1.1       oldName\n\n\n*Similarly to what you did in step 3, change the computer name from oldName to newName. Then save and exit.\n\n*Exit the root user:\nroot@oldName:~# exit\n\n\n*Save all of your unsaved work and restart your computer:\nnavid@oldName:~$ reboot\n\n\n*Open your terminal, and you will see that your computer name has successfully been changed! :-)\nnavid@newName:~$ \n\nNote: Although you may achieve what you want by skipping steps 4 and 5, I strongly recommend doing them as well, to avoid potential errors in the future.\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why can I modify a read-only file?\n\nA: Changing system settings requires superuser permissions. From a terminal, do\nsudo <editor> <filename>\n\nwhere  could be vim or nano or any other editor command, and  is the one you need to edit.\nYou could also usegksudo gedit <filename>.\nIn either case you will be prompted for password of a user with superuser permissions - in a normal Ubuntu installation this would be the first user created during installation.\n\nA: If you are editing a file without sudo, and you need sudo in order to save, simply use this vim command:\n:w !sudo tee %\n\nCredit to Dr Beco. Note that vim will notice the file change and ask you if you want to (L)oad the changes, press L.\n\nA: sudo -H gedit <path to file>\n\neg : \nsudo -H gedit /etc/environment\n\nor\nsudo nano /etc/environment\nCtrl + X and Ctrl + Y and hit Enter(for nano)\n\nA: By default you have wight permission to hosts file to root user only, as shown below:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 252 Dec 16 08:40 /etc/hosts\n\nHence you have to use sudo to edit this or else you can use below command to become root\nsudo su -\n\nhowever this is not recommended at all.\nsafest and recommended it you use below command to edit the file\n\nsudo vim /etc/hosts\n\nthen press \"Esc\" on keyboard and then type \":w!\" to write the changes to the hosts file then agin type \":q\" or \":q!\", this should shall do the trick for you.\n\nA: You might not have access to the file to change it.\nIn order to get access you need to get super user privileges and that is sudo.\nOpen terminal, type:\nsudo -H gedit \"your file name \"\n\nIf you use any other text editor type that in.\n", "Q: Permission denied when i put $ $sudo dd if='/Users/nickzieno/Downloads/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.img' of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m\ndd: /dev/rdiskN: Permission denied\n\nA: When typing on a command line, a $ represents the prompt, you should not type this directly in front of sudo, nor anywhere at the beginning of that command.\n", "Q: DOS Executable files Is there any way to run a program that uses a dos executable file on a desktop?

I'm currently running windows8.1 and wish to install Ubuntu14.01 on VirtualBox. \nUpon the \"Installation type\" screen it gives me the option to:\n1) Erase disk and install Ubuntu [Warning: this will delete any files on the disk]\n2) Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security\n3) Use LVM with the new Ubuntu installation\n4) Something else.\nForgive my ignorance, but i'm relatively new to virtualization, anyway heres my question:\nDoes choice (1) imply erasing my current disk/files from which I run windows8.1 on? My intuition suggests not, since its a 'virtual desktop'. When I choose \"something else\" to potentially partition my hard drive, the only entry that appears is \"/dev/sda ATA VBOX HARDDISK(8.6GB)\"\nSo would it be safe to choose option 1, and it not affect my current disk/files from my windows OS?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: TL;DR - any option is safe, option 1 being the easiest.\nWhen you created the virtual machine to install Ubuntu on, Virtualbox asked you to create a virtual drive.\nUnless you explicitly exposed your physical disks to your virtual machine (it's very unlikely you've done this accidentally), your virtual machine is constrained to that virtual disk (ATA VBOX HARDDISK(8.6GB)) which resides in a file on the physical disk. \nTherefore you can do whatever you please from within that VM and it won't be able to touch anything outside that file, i.e. it won't affect anything on your Windows partition (except for space occupied by the virtual disk backing file, that is).\n", "Q: HDD mounts then immediately unmounts My wife had received a virus on her iMac some time ago.

I booted an Ubuntu live CD & tried to write the bootloader\nI ran a command in ubuntu\nSudo dd if=/usr/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda\nWhat it did is make situations worse.\nThis command deleted my system_drv partition which was the boot partition.\nSo I ran testdisk & recovered that partition.\nIn testdisk I selected Intel type partitions for recovery.\nThough the partition was recovered it wiped data from the rest of my partitions. Now in my laptop there is a LENOVO partition containing the lenovo drivers, SYSTEM_DRV (boot) & some other recovery partitions. Two partitions remain one was Data & other is Windows8_OS.\nWhen I did my first recovery should I have selected efi/gpt instead of Intel? & if yes is it possible to recover now or I have lost my data? \nMy final questions are:\nShould I try to recover those partitions using testdisk? \nOr Is There Any Other Reliable Software?\nOr Is There Any Alternate Way?\nOr should I just handover to Lenovo for repairing the drive.\nThough the data is gone I have checked in Gpart & confirmed that the partitions are still intact & I assume the partition table is also intact.

What is \"line buffering\"?\ntail -f <file> | fgrep --line-buffered \"string\" | sed 's/stuff//g' >> output.txt\n\n\nA: When using non-interactively, most standard commands, include grep, buffer the output, meaning it does not write data immediately to stdout. It collects large amount of data (depend on OS, in Linux, often 4096 bytes) before writing.\nIn your command, grep's output is piped to stdin of sed command, so grep buffer its output.\nSo, --line-buffered option causing grep using line buffer, meaning writing output each time it saw a newline, instead of waiting to reach 4096 bytes by default. But in this case, you don't need grep at all, just use tail + sed:\ntail -f <file> | sed '/string/s/stuff//g' >> output.txt\n\nWith command that does not have option to modify buffer, you can use GNU coreutils stdbuf\ntail -f <file> | stdbuf -oL fgrep \"string\" | sed 's/stuff//g' >> output.txt\n\nto turn on line buffering or using -o0 to disable buffer.\nNote\n\n\n*\n\n*stdio buffering\n", "Q: How can I disable i915 Intel integrated graphics permanently?

In looking around on eBay I found this cheap \"EasyCap\" usb stick that I can run cables from my VCR to that device and supposedly capture the viedo easily.  \nI tried VLC with the \"Open Capture Device\" option, and it showed a video0 device which I tried as the video input.  For the audio input it only says 1,0 and 1,2 - and I don't know what that means.  I tried selecting each one at a time and trying the capture.  Found out I had to set the video height and width in the \"advanced options\" for VLC - they apparently default to 0 which meant I had no video.  \nAfter making those 2 changes then I do get video fine.  I do not, however, get any audio.  I did some reading on the net and it would seem I should have another audio device show up when the stick is plugged in, but I don't get a new one.

Now it doesn't launchs at all.\nMy questions are: what should I do now? what is the cause of this problem?\njust because I don't have enough reputation here now, but I want you to see the photo of system messages, this is the link to my question with photo at stackoverflow. \n\nA: I've looked up the model of your notebook and it would appear that if it is as originally sold, it may have either the 1TB hard drive or a 128gb SSD.  The symptoms you describe suggest a dying hard drive, which is consistent with very thin portable computers.  Hard drives are delicate machines under the best of circumstances, and so the thinner and denser the machine it is housed in, the less that exists to protect it if it is handled roughly.\nCertainly I can offer you some shortcuts to diagnosing for certain that you need to replace the drive in your machine, but to cut to the chase, you probably need to plan to do that, and when you do, that you purchase solid state next time.  Supposing that your drive might be mSATA, rest assured you can purchase a 1TB in solid state for under $500, and in fact, you could probably tolerate something smaller in capacity and save a few dollars.  Now back to the matter of diagnostics.\nThe advice you've already received is good.  Yes, you can just boot your notebook to an external USB live Ubuntu boot medium such as that which you probably installed it with.  Alternately you can use an external USB cd/dvd drive to boot to a live cd/dvd.  Either will work.\nOnce you have booted to external media, you will want to open the included utility known as Disk Utility.  There you will see an area marked SMART, provided of course your dying drive supports that protocol.  If it does, you will not only be able to determine immediately if it is dying, but even what likely caused it and how long you have left to rescue any data you wish to save.\nRescuing your data will be easy once you are booted to this external media, provided of course that your personal data directories are not encrypted anyway.\n", "Q: How to get up time for the terminal How to get the uptime from.

I heard Linux can get viruses through Wine,and I was curious if the viruses work only while Wine is running.\nIn other words, could I stop a virus from doing it's thing by just quitting Wine?\n\nA: \nDo Wine Viruses only work while Wine is running?\n\nYes, if it is a trojan, rootkit, worm program specifically designed to infect Windows machine.\n(Viruses through wine has already happened.)\n\ncould I stop a virus from doing it's thing by just quitting Wine?\n\nYes, and no.\nYes\nIf It's a Windows virus, kill the Windows Environment(wine), and it won't have a leg to stand on. The Virus is still installed, but its not doing any harm. If you remove wine - to the best of my knowledge - it just removes its binaries. Reinstalling wine later, will show that the applications are still installed.\nRemoving the ~/.wine folder completely, however, will give some sense of safety. Mind you that if it did not copy it self somewhere else then the ~/.wine folder. In which case, you have a Windows binary somewhere, that possibly can cause harm to your system.\nNo\nIf the virus is targeting Linux with Wine environment. Although the chance for you specifically to catch this rare virus is pretty slim, I would still urge you to read an article by the Wine community on how to Secure wine (Links to empty page).\nHow rare the virus may be, its still advised to secure Wine as much as possible. Especially if your on a business side of things.\n\nMy preferred graphical front-end for Wine is PlayOnLinux, with that you have more control over your Wine environment, and there is a separate environment per application. So, if you happened to get infected by using Safari, use the Configuration options to examine and/or restore, or just delete the entire Safari Volume.\n\n\nExcerpt image from here: PlayOnLinux Explained:  Wine Configuration | GamersOnLinux\n\nNote:\nIt's a small chance, but, even after securing wine, you still might get infected by a virus or even viruses specifically designed to hack/infect Linux through wine. Just for security reasons, I have installed Malwarebytes, and SuperAntiSpyware. Also note that the custom explorer.exe - or other wine software - created by the wine team, might be considered as malicious by the aforementioned security software.\nIMHO: PlayOnLinux is a safer alternative, because you have more control over wine, with the Configuration tools. Whilst installing only wine, installs a Windows environment in your Linux system without any way of monitoring it.\nPlayOnLinux doesn't need wine pre-installed. It creates a Wine Prefix(a separate working environment) with wine. Then it will install the software in the separate Wine Prefix. Meaning, the software cannot access other environments. Thus making it harder to infect other parts of Windows software installed in a different Wine Prefix.\nFurther reading:\n\n*\n\n*[Security Feature]: Run Playonlinux/Wine as isolated user. - The forum - PlayOnLinux\n\n\n*Another report of malware running on Wine\n\n\n*SecuringWine - The Official Wine Wiki\n\nA: Maybe. There's no short answer for this.\nI'll start by saying your introduction makes it sound like you think Linux can't get viruses (and/or malware). That may just be my inference but it's important to note that malware is just software and you can run bad software on Ubuntu just as easily as on Windows as long as it's compatible. Linux isn't invulnerable.\nAs for malware running under Wine, if it was literally an active application (like a trojan RAT), stopping Wine (wineserver -k to be sure) would stop it from running.\nHowever... It's comically easy to detect if the environment is Wine. There is little sandboxing between Wine and Ubuntu by default so malware could detect a Wine environment and then could do pretty much anything you can do to your Ubuntu system. That includes running native commands, interfacing with Ubuntu systems, standard local privilage exploit stuff, downloading native malware and scripting into user-based auto-start mechanisms (~/.config/autostart/ et alii) to load itself back up after rebooting.\nIs that likely? I don't know. Most Windows malware will probably not bother probing for Wine environments but that's just my hunch. I have no idea whether any such malware exists but either way, with the rise in popularity of Linux, OSX and Wine, I doubt it'll be long before many malware droppers probe their environment. We're only talking a few lines of code for a much better infection.\n\nA: I think that the above answers answer the question well, but I would also like to add that running a virus in wine WON'T stop any viruses that access/modify/delete files on the system.\nFor instance, the dreaded CryptoLocker ransomware will encrypt all your documents, then will demand payment to decrypt them. The virus could still easily access the Z:\\ drive and encrypt all your files. (Actually, it wouldn't even need to do that; in wine's virtual C:\\ drive, the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, My Pictures, My Music, and My Videos folders are symlinked to the folders in your home directory.)

Make sure all languages you need are installed, select English and apply system wide. Then, when logged in as the standard user, use Language Support to switch to the desired language.\n", "Q: How to resume download during apt-get install I am trying to install android studio via terminal on Ubuntu 12.04.

I'm having issues with npm in a Vagrant box I'm setting up. I noticed that the npm version is somewhat old, so I wanted to check the problem with the latest release.\nIt is my understanding that you should be able to update npm using npm install -g npm, but the command has no effect on the npm being used:\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n1.3.10\nvagrant@box:~$ sudo npm install -g npm\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/npm\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-2.1.12.tgz\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-2.1.12.tgz\n/usr/local/bin/npm -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js\nnpm@2.1.12 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n1.3.10\n\nI also tried using n (as suggested in How can I update my nodeJS to the latest version?) to update, but it affects neither npm nor node:\nvagrant@box:~$ node -v\nv0.10.25\nvagrant@box:~$\nvagrant@box:~$ sudo npm install -g n\n/usr/bin/n -> /usr/lib/node_modules/n/bin/n\nn@1.2.9 /usr/lib/node_modules/n\nvagrant@box:~$ sudo n stable\n\n     install : v0.10.33\n       mkdir : /usr/local/n/versions/0.10.33\n       fetch : http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.33/node-v0.10.33-linux-x64.tar.gz\n   installed : v0.10.33\n\nvagrant@box:~$ node -v\nv0.10.25\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n1.3.10\n\nWhat do I have to do to update npm to the latest version?\n\nA: When you first do npm install -g npm, the shell (Bash) will search for npm in your path, find /usr/bin/npm installed by the system package, and then use it to install the new version of npm. The new version will be installed in /usr/local/bin/npm.\nNow, your path should have /usr/local/bin/ BEFORE /usr/bin/, so you would think it would now pick up the updated version in /usr/local/bin/, right? Wrong.\nBash will CACHE executable paths after the first time it searches for them, so when you say npm the 2nd time, it is still using the cached version which it first found as /usr/bin/npm.\nTo tell Bash to clear this cache and look through the path again, you have to do a hash -r.\nAfter installing npm and doing this, my shell picked up the new version of npm just fine.\nThanks\n\nA: You can update nodejs by using npm itself, a PPA, or manually. \nnpm:\nCheck the current version you have:\nnode -v\n\nThe following clears your cache.\nsudo npm cache clean -f\n\nInstall n\nsudo npm install -g n\n\nYou can tell it to install a specific version like so:\nsudo n 0.8.11\n\nOr just tell it to install the latest stable version. Both may take a while.\nsudo n stable\n\nTo see if it actually upgraded, run:\nnode -v\n\nPPA:\nOther option is to install it via a PPA by chris-lea;\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nThis PPA Supports the following distros: Utopic (14.10), Trusty (14.04), Saucy (13.10), Raring (13.04), Quantal (12.10), Precise (12.04), Oneiric (11.10), Natty (11.04), Lucid (10.04).\nManually:\nYou can always update it by manually downloading the latest version and installing it yourself! \n\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade Node.js via NPM\n\n*Node.js fundamentals: how to upgrade the Node.js version | The Holmes Office\n\n*node.js : chris lea\n\n*node.js - downloads\n\nA: Update NPM to latest version in one command\nTo upgrade or update the version of your npm, just type in terminal:\nsudo npm install npm@latest -g\n\nAs mentioned in the footer of the NPM documentation\n\nA: I still don't understand why, but I have to run npm install -g npm twice for it to have the desired effect:\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n1.3.10\nvagrant@box:~$ sudo npm install -g npm\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/npm\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-2.1.12.tgz\nnpm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-2.1.12.tgz\n/usr/local/bin/npm -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js\nnpm@2.1.12 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n1.3.10\nvagrant@box:~$ sudo npm install -g npm\n/usr/bin/npm -> /usr/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js\nnpm@2.1.12 /usr/lib/node_modules/npm\nvagrant@box:~$ npm -v\n2.1.12\n\n\nA: Most of the time I'm unable to upgrade it with the global command. What worked for me however is upgrading the package from the source of all the systems node-modules:\nFind out where npm is installed and go into that folder\n# Below command shows the destination (remove sed pipe to see the full path of npm-cli)\nwhereis npm | cut -c 6- | xargs readlink -f | sed 's/.\\{19\\}$//'\n\n# Go in there and install it manually.

It'll surely work. It did for me by npm install npm -g.\n\nA: I don't see any reason to reinstall something that is ready there, just use update -g built into the package manager to update itself:\n$ npm -v\n2.15.1\n$ sudo npm update -g npm\n/usr/local/bin/npm -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js\nnpm@3.10.9 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm\n$ npm -v\n3.10.9\n\nMake sure that global flag -g is before the packages.

I've experienced a lot of different monitors and concluded that some manufacturers prefer not to give us the choice to simply close our eyes to tune out the annoying screen flickers which can occur during such times of transition and instead blank the monitor for several seconds.  It is possible this screen blanking is an option in your monitor's setup settings.\nEdit:  I am extending my previous conclusion to extend to the graphics hardware of the laptop, be it considered the monitor or not.

And how do you think I should partition my HDD?\n\nA: First you have to create a new partition on sdb with fdisk. You have to format this partition with ext4 (or any other filesystem type you want). \nTo move all the data I recommend you to boot from a LiveCD/LiveUSB. Mount sda2 in /mnt/sda2 and sdb1 in /mnt/sdb1. Then copy all the data from /mnt/sda2/home to /mnt/sda2. Finally you have to edit the /mnt/sda2/etc/fstab to automatically mount the /home filesystem:\nUUID=37xxxxxxx /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nyou can get the UUID with blkid\n$ sudo blkid /dev/sdb1\n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"379xxxxxx\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"0006a6c7-06\" \n\n", "Q: Silent installation for apt-get For work I have to prepare a lot of PCs. I have to shove bunch of sudo apt-get install commands into the terminal - that's quite tedious.  I could probably put all of them into sh script (maybe), but some of the commands require adding new repository (sudo add-apt-repository) or adding new key (??) via gpg command - and they require the user to press ENTER. \nAny way to to say \"yes\" to all or something? This would probably require adding some options to apt-get and gpg commands?\n\nA: You can append the --assume-yes and --force-yes flags to automatically say yes to all.\nsudo apt-get --assume-yes --force-yes install <packagename(s)>\nTo make these changes permanent, edit /etc/apt/apt.conf and add the lines\nAPT::Get::Assume-Yes \"true\";    \nAPT::Get::force-yes \"true\";\n\nThis is what the man page of apt-get says - \n   -y, --yes, --assume-yes\n       Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and\n       run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as\n       changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated\n       package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will\n       abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\n   --force-yes\n       Force yes; this is a dangerous option that will cause apt to\n       continue without prompting if it is doing something potentially\n       harmful. It should not be used except in very special situations.\n       Using force-yes can potentially destroy your system! Configuration\n       Item: APT::Get::force-yes.\n\n\nA: Barring a custom install of a pre-configured system, I'd probably go with an install script run on each system.\nWhat are the commands that need to press enter? add-apt-repository's help advertises it's -y option:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository --help\nUsage: add-apt-repository [options] repository\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -y, --yes   force yes on all confirmation questions\n\nThe help link below says that for adding PPA's \"If a public key is required and available it is automatically downloaded and registered.\" There are also packages like ubuntu-keyring, ubuntu-extras-keyring, linuxmint-keyring etc that contain the keys for various repositories. And man gpg should tell how to get it to automatically install a key, if you're stuck using it.\nAnd/or you could edit the sources.list files directly with sed/awk, or if the systems are identical just copy over the \"finished\" files.\nThis Ubuntu help page has more info on how to manage software repositories from the command line.\nAnd if you're preparing a lot of systems, can I assume you'll only be downloading the .deb packages once, and installing them all to each machine, instead of updating then downloading them all for every system? If you have all the .deb's in one folder this command would install all of them:  \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -iR [deb-directory]\nFYI, I used to see one odd package that would wait for an enter before finishing installing, apparently it was inside one of it's own config scripts, and even apt-get's --force-yes wouldn't work with it. You don't have any of that type, do you?\n\nOr, if you're intent on just force-feeding a bunch of keystrokes into a telnet (should work for other methods too) terminal, you could use a bash script like this one:\n{\necho \"open 192.168.55.55\"\nsleep 0.5\necho \"$login\"\nsleep 0.5\necho \"$password\"\nsleep 0.5\necho \"command1\"\nsleep 2\necho \" \"\nsleep 5\necho \"exit\"\n} | telnet\n\nUsing different sleep times for delays between \"typing\", echoing a space with \" \" or even just echo should send a newline \"return\".\n", "Q: Is there a system setting to reduce nvidia-331 overheats when playing video (14.04) I recently upgraded to 14.04 with the nvidia-331 driver (Dell Latitude E6430). The performance is lightning fast with the exception of playing video like YouTube or Skype. According to indicator-sensors the NVMS 5200 temperature rises right up to 95+ C (Other temperatures stay below 80), and indicator-cpufreq immediately reduces cpufreq to the minimum to cool the machine down. Consequently if I set off a video by accident, I have to suspend Ubuntu and let it cool for a few minutes to avoid moving at a snail's pace.\nI love the performance of the driver otherwise, and would love to just tweak a system setting so that the card just paces itself a bit when Skyping or playing Flash, rather than revert drivers. Is there such a setting? I shouldn't have to buy a cooling fan to Skype just because of a driver upgrade.\n\nA: Laptops often overheat when their graphics cards are used near capacity.  This is why gamers typically use cooling pads with them, and also why I recommend everyone use cooling pads all the time.  I will now give you not one but two solutions.\nBuy a LARGE cooling pad wih one or two large diameter fans.  they can actually cost less than units with smaller fans, so don't gauge by price.\nClean the dust out of your laptop.

Coming from a Microsoft Windows Environment, what is the best way to sync one's calendar on Ubuntu / Thunderbird / Lightning?\n\nA: The ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar plugin for Thunderbird seems to solve this problem gracefully.  Here are some steps to get you going:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Lightning Plugin for Thunderbird.\n\n*Download the ms-exchange calendar plugin from ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar.  The *.xpi plugin may be inside a zip file.  Save the file to your Downloads folder (or elsewhere).\n\n*In Thunderbird, click menu-->Add-ons\n\n*Click the icon to install an add-on from a local file (fig 1 below).\n\n*Once the plugins are all installed and Thunderbird has re-started, open the calendar tab in Thunderbird.  Right click in the calendars section and choose \"new calendar\".\n\n*Choose \"On the network\"\n\n*Choose Microsoft Exchange.\n\n*Choose a name for the calendar.\n\n*Now the tricky part.  I could not get the autodiscovery feature to work, but if you enter the correct server url and username, you're good to go.  For office 365, the url is:  https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx.  See figure 2 below.  \n\n*Click \"Check Server and Mailbox\".  If you got the server and username right, the folder base input should appear With a Next button (figure 3).  Click Next.  Everything seems to work from this point.

On Windows the files are located in a different spot (Google will tell you where), but the overall method should still work with DropBox, SeaFile, or equivalent data-syncing services.\nI use Thunderbird/Lightning as my email/calendar client on my main computer (Thinkpad W541, Ubuntu Unity, 16.04) and my travel Chromebook (Acer C720, Ubuntu XFCE, 16.04), and I wanted to regularly sync the calendar data between both machines.  Suggestions online often mention Google Calendar, but I'd rather use open-source tools (that I control) to do the job.  I use SeaFile (a FOSS DropBox equivalent) to sync folders & files between my machines.\nStep 1:  On my new Chromebook, I copy over my entire Thunderbird directory:\nrsync -zarv user@thinkpad:~/.thunderbird/  ~/.thunderbird/\nThen, I install Thunderbird and open it: presto, all my accounts, old emails, and (most importantly) calendar events are accessible. Great!\nStep 2: It looks like all relevant Thunderbird data are stored in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/, with calendar data in ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/.  On the Chromebook, I create a new calendar event, save it, and see that ~/.thunderbird/blah.default/calendar-data/local.sqlite has increased in size and has a newer \"last-modified\" timestamp.  I conclude that local.sqlite contains all relevant calendar data.\nStep 3: I close Thunderbird on both machines, then use SeaFile to sync the entire calander-data/ folder on both.  I see that the newer filesize and timestamp have successfully synced on the Thinkpad. I open Thunderbird on the new machine, and there in the calendar is my new event.  Success!\nDrawbacks: \nThe main drawback seems to be that if Thunderbird is open on both machines and either calendar is edited, syncing the calendar-data files sometimes causes the other machine's Thunderbird to crash.  They just weren't built to handle that sort of I/O.  But otherwise: it works great!\n", "Q: How to use rsyslog? I've been scouring forums for a few hours and cannot find a concrete explanation on how to use rsyslog.

I will provide any extra information as needed.\n\nA: Well I see a few people checking this question out and I figured out how to do it. So I'll make a small beginner's guide to rsyslog.\nIf you just want to forward syslog data to a remote server:\n\nAdd this line to the bottom of /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf (based on protocol):\nUDP: *.* @remoteserverIP:PORT #usually port 514\nTCP: *.* @@remoteserverIP:PORT #usually port 514\n\nAdd these lines to a .conf file you create in /etc/rsyslog.d/\n$ModLoad imfile\n$InputFileName /var/log/test   #change this to desired input\n$InputFileTag test             #change filetag\n$InputFileStateFile stat-test  \n$InputFileSeverity info        #log severity\nInputRunFileMonitor           \n*.* @remoteserverIP:PORT       #change to remote server\n\n\nRestart rsyslog\nsudo service rsyslog restart\n\nThen on the remote (logging) server you need to edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file to listen for traffic.  The top of the file will have these sections:\n# provides UDP syslog reception\n#$ModLoad imudp\n#$UDPServerRun 514\n\n# provides TCP syslog reception\n#$ModLoad imtcp\n#$InputTCPServerRun 514\n\nUncomment the section for the appropriate protocol.\nAt the end of the file you'll probably want to include some sort of filtering template so the logs get parsed out into files based on where they came from.  Here's an example:\n$template FILENAME,\"/var/log/%fromhost-ip%/access.log\n*.* ?FILENAME\n\nSave the file and restart the service on this machine.\nHopefully this works for all of you!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 Lifespan Ubuntu 14.10 will be supported for 9 months for Ubuntu Desktop.

The answer provided there says to use disk utility, but I am running this vm as a server and there is only the command line. How can I achieve what was provided here with just a CLI?\n\nA: I don't think you can necessarily do this as easily as you would a GUI. I recommend adding Ubuntu Desktop (or some GUI) first, and then trying to insert the Guest Additions ISO. If that still doesn't work, try navigating to the ISO file and burning it on to an actual medium. From there, you should mount your host CD/DVD drive and install additions that way. It's possible to install Additions from CLI, but it will depend on what the CD name is in order to navigate to it. If it's more than one word, you need to put it in quotes.

So I was obliged to restart it.\nBut after I restarted I couldn't access Windows 7 that I already had in it. I used the windows 7 CD to access the command prompt then I found that my local drive C: had shrunk in size and got the new name Linux instead of the local drive. I could not install Windows on my heard disk. \nI tried Ubuntu without installing it using CD and was surprised to find that the partition  containing old Windows 7 is still there and showing its normal size 265 GB. How can I recover my windows 7 installation / partition?\n\nA: Yours sounds like a complicated situation, I'm not sure what shape your hard drive & Windows partition is in, being able to see it in a live Ubuntu, but the Windows disk not seeing it...\nI would try (running a live Ubuntu cd - \"try without installing\") to mount the windows partition (mounted read-only = ro just in case) and take a look at the files, see if they're all there & aren't corrupted:\nTo find out what device the partition's on, you can check gparted, or gnome disk utility (Disks), or run lsblk or sudo blkid. It's probably similar to /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1.\nIn a terminal, after creating an empty folder for a mount point (ex. sudo mkdir -p /media/win), mount it read only with sudo mount -r /dev/[the right one] /media/win\n[Searched for an easy answer for \"how to mount windows read only\" but didn't find one oddly]\nIf the windows partition looks good, you could try to repair it's bootloader. Read \"How can I repair the Windows 8 EFI Bootloader?\" on superuser.com  for help - it says Windows 8, but questions about Windows 7 get marked as a duplicate of that one... I'm not too sure about the EFI being different.\n\nOr if the wndows partition doesn't look good, you could try testdisk that might be able to recover the partition &/or boot loader too.

I was shocked to discover that my password could be easily reset via the command line. Does that mean anybody with physical access to my machine could reset the password and read the encrypted contents of my home folder? If so, how do I prevent it from happening?\n\nA: \nDoes that mean anybody with physical access to my machine could reset the password and read the encrypted contents of my home folder?\n\nNo, home encryption is linked to that password so if I stole your computer and changed the user password, I wouldn't be able to easily (more on that later) decrypt the data.\nThat said, access to recovery mode means getting root on the disk and as root I can script anything to run in the background... I could implement a key-logger or other nastiness to sniff out your password as you entered it, or access the data once decrypted without you knowing.\nYou can disable recovery mode or set a password on grub to prompt the user if they want anything but the standard option. Of course somebody could slip a bootable USB stick or DVD in and mount the disk externally so you should also change the boot order (and password protect BIOS) to only boot to the first harddisk.\nThat stops the laziest hackers. If somebody has a screwdriver with them, a laptop and a SATA→USB bus, they can just pop the drive out and mount it on their laptop, change your password and put everything back. I reckon I could do the whole thing in well under five minutes. Even less on a laptop as their drives are often more accessible.\nIf you want to defeat me, you'll need to encrypt the whole thing at install-time. That means a reinstall and you needing to enter your password in each time.\nBut even then, as dobey says, if I really want the data, I'll clone the disk as a raw image file (~20minutes), and use an EC2 cluster to crack it (hours, days, weeks)... Or a $5 wrench and your fingers (seconds)... \n\n\nA: Use full disk encryption instead. And limit physical access to your machine.\nIf someone has physical access to your machine, they could simply steal your disk and take it elsewhere to eventually break the encryption as well.\n", "Q: How to Re Generate All Gnome Schemas for Ubuntu 12.04 To compile a package I went on installing systemd package from Utopic 14.10 with all its dependencies on my [Modified] Ubuntu 12.04.

Then I discovered that I am stuck at the login screen. i.e. my password is accepted but something fails later (before any desktop is shown) and I am returned to the login screen.\nFrom an Ubuntu USB stick I performed a $ sudo chroot /mnt after mounting my root partition [+ /boot /home and /boot/efi partition] on /mnt.\nI discovered after launching gconf-editor that all schemas are un-readable by Ubuntu 12.04 as they surely have been upgrated to the GNOME Utopic 14.10 version.\n$ xhost +\n$ for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /run /sys; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n$ sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/\n$ modprobe efivars\n$ sudo chroot /mnt\n# export DISPLAY=:0.0\n# gconf-editor\n\nAll schemas for apps / desktop / system are unreadable and a key icon is displayed.\nWhen double clicking any schema I get a pop-up window saying Currently pairs and schemas can't be edited. This will be changed in a later version.\nSo my question is : As these schemas were modified by triggering scripts when installing the systemd package, is there anyway I can re-generate valid Precise 12.04 schemas ? Or should I throw away my entire Precise 12.04 system because of these GNOME quirks ?\nI did re-install the packages gsettings-desktop-schemas and gnome-settings-daemon however to no avail.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you're asking, but most everything in GNOME doesn't use gconf any more. They use dconf. Also, yes, you can't edit pairs or schemas in gconf-editor. It will likely never be fixed though, as GNOME has moved away from gconf and over to dconf.\nI'm not sure what you mena bout the schemas being unreadable. If you can see the schema in gconf-editor, then it's clearly readable.\nIf you simply directly force installed packages from 14.10 onto 12.04 though, you likely have a deeper problem than schemas. A whole lot has changed in the last 2.5 years, in both GNOME and Ubuntu.\nYou broke the system, so really you get to keep both pieces. I have no idea from your question, what is actually broken though, so I can't tell you how to fix it. Upgrading to 14.04 might help.\nLooking at ~/.xsession-errors should tell you why the session fails to load after you log in, though.\n", "Q: What would cause a system freeze from navigation to /proc? This is really driving me crazy, if I pull up nautilus and navigate to /proc, my system will completely freeze up. The only way to get out seems to be to SysReq RSEINUB, but sometimes even that doesn't work and I have to hold the power button. This happens even if I gksudo nautilus, I even created another user and I get the same thing. If I open up a shell and navigate there; no problems, same with using MC and I installed dolphin; no problem using either. I reinstalled nautilus and reinstalled the kernel; no dice. I don't even know what to provide as clues, as I cant find anything that seems significant in the logs. I've tried changing graphics drivers removing purging and reinstalling various components, all to no avail. My understanding is that /proc is a virtual file system created by the kernel and therefore recreated at every reboot. What could be causing such a problem?\n\nA: Just found https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1395880 - it seems to have something to do with a bug in Broadcom's proprietary Wi-Fi drivers.\nThe first thing that comes to mind is /proc/brcm_monitor0, a non-standard Broadcom interface that allows putting the Wi-Fi card in monitor mode. There was another bug that causes the entire kernel to crash when attempting to write to that file; I wouldn't be surprised if Nautilus tries to read the file to thumbnail it, triggering that bug and causing the kernel to crash. However, I have no idea if the two bugs are related or not.\nEDIT: looks like reading the file triggers the bug too, and the file is chmodded 644, meaning that any user can read that file and thus trigger the bug. Simple hack to test this (too lazy to potentially crash my computer right now) would be to run sudo chmod go-r /proc/brcm_monitor0 in a terminal and see if Nautilus still freezes.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 installation - hide ssd builtin disk I'm trying to install ubuntu 14.04 in my main disk (sda).

Any advice/guidance would be appreciated... been looking around askubuntu but it looks like the old threads were about different things/by more advanced users.  Thanks!\n\nA: In my experience, network backups are good for people with lots of time.  Anyone who has so little to backup that they can perform the backup time-effectively, can do so using a usb flashdrive such as the 128 I'm using my Ubuntu backup utility with, making incremental backups every couple of days.  On average flash drives are faster than network backups.  Network backups have other advantages flash drives lack, such as \"everywhereness\".\nAlso, depending on the age, size, and condition of your old drive, you might consider a procedure I long depended on when being a windows users.  If say your hard drive is in a laptop and you have been thinking of upgrading to a more rugged solid state drive, this could be a great time to replace the drive itself.  Then you can choose between making an all new fresh install on the new drive, or you can use an excellent program such as clonezilla to make an identical copy of your old drive onto your new drive before performing a traditional upgrade. Either way your data is still safe on the previous drive, and if you mount your old drive into an external usb drive case, you can boot to it anytime using any pc. \n", "Q: Adding Win7 to Ubuntu through Ubuntu dual booting I really need some step by step help here.

I just don't trust it enough to get rid of my Win7 data yet.  :)\n\nA: if you are trying to put ubuntu and windows 7 on the same hard dis, it's a lot easier to install windows first and leave some free space on the drive. then install ubuntu. if you have already installed ubuntu it can be done if you have free space on the disk. if not you have to resize ubuntu to make some space using gparted. you have to use your ubuntu live disk for that. boot with that and click try ubuntu, then use gparted to make the ubuntu partitions smaller to leave some free space. search for these terms for guides how to do that. then you can install windows on the free space but windows takes over the boot up so you can't choose between them. you then have to load the try ubuntu disc and use firefox for a guide how to reinstall grub. you will have to use the terminal but you can learn how to copy and paste the lines into the terminal. in the terminal paste is ctr-shft-v, not ctr-v. that confused me for a while. then when you boot up from the hard disk ubuntu takes over and lets you choose to boot either ubuntu or windows. if I were you I would backup any personal stuff on the hard drive and format the disk, install windows on half the drive then ubuntu on the other half. then it should boot properly with the choice using grub. it's windows fault for not liking linux.\n", "Q: Trying to make a live USB So I have been trying to make and get working a Live USB for Ubuntu (14.10) on a Windows 8 machine with UEFI.

My boss wanted a GUI, so I installed ubuntu-desktop, without recommends to reduce the amount of extra stuff loaded on the server. It appears that there are missing packages for basic functionality though. \nIn the Status Menu at the top of the screen, I expect to find a gear (the system menu) with options to logoff, shutdown, restart, etc. That system menu is missing. What package does it reside in?\n\nA: That's The Session Menu, package indicator-session\n", "Q: How to add some special characters to a layout Today, I bought a gaming keyboard which has an English layout. The problem here is that I am Portuguese and this keyboard doesn't have ~ and ç.\nIs there any way that I can include those keys in my new keyboard layout?\n\nA: When you add a Portuguese keyboard layout it automatically makes these characters for you. The fact that your keyboard doesn't have a Portuguese layout is not a problem.Only you have to remember which character stands for which.\nClick on the language icon on the right top corner and you can add Portuguese layout.\n", "Q: What do the 6 different \"Path\" options do in Inkscape?

The colour is taken from whichever shape is on top.\nThe Difference Option:\n\nIn this one, whichever image is on top has it's shape \"removed\" from the one below (like cookie dough cutter). The colour is taken from whichever shape is on the bottom.\nThe Intersection Option:\n\nThe overlap is the only bit kept here. If there is no overlap, nothing will be left over. The colour is taken from whichever shape is on the bottom.\nThe Exclusion Option:\n\nIn this one the overlap is removed, and the rest is kept. The colour is taken from whichever shape is on the bottom.\nThe Division Option:\n\nThis is like using the Difference Option and the Intersection Option one after the other. It creates 2 shapes. The colour is taken from whichever shape is on the bottom.\nThe Cut Paths Option:\n\nThis one is quite messed up. When I first did it, the results were completely transparent. However, on the left we have a whole square (no change) and on the right we have a circle cut into 2, like the Division option.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n", "Q: How do I use GROMIT?

I know that my question isn't the first of it's kind but I'm not the most seasoned when it comes to Ubuntu, or Windows for that matter, installation or repair. From what I can tell I must have either partitioned my HDD incorrectly or installed Ubuntu or a part there of in a way that blocks grub from Windows 7. I have already attempted to repair grub using boot-repair (through Grub Customizer) and even though the repair via the repair report was successful I still can not boot Windows 7. \nHere is the boot-repair report itself \nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9553822/\nI will keep reading through the already answered questions but for now any advice or help would be appreciated.\nThank you, \nEli\n\nA: I don't claim to be expert interpreting the boot-repair reports, but I don't see a surviving windows partition, so I honestly don't think you have windows anymore.  If it helps I can tell you a lot of things to make you feel better about that, and I can offer significant assistance helping you to set up WINE such that you will actually be able to run windows software under ubuntu BETTER than it ever ran under windows.\nNow, just in case I misread that boot-repair report, please open the Ubuntu utility known as \"disk utility\" to verify the windows partition still exists.  If it does, it ought to be possible to fix it with boot repair, although personally I disliked the version of boot repair you install on the drive you are trying to fix.  I recommend that which runs from a live boot CD, as that's the only type which has worked for me.\nPersonally I suspect that as many such complaints I've read, you accidentally wiped out your windows partition and there's no getting it back, short of a restore from a full backup.\n", "Q: Installing Eagle on 14.04 x64 I have downloaded the latest version of Eagle 7.2 from this link.\nThe software is saved in Desktop.

So even though I have selected to show the battery status in the menu bar only when charging or in use (in power settings), it is ALWAYS displayed.

As I say all that happened was I turned it off one night working perfectly fine and the next morning suddenly I have a buffer I/O error.\nAny help or info would be hugely appreciated.\n\nA: Probably a hard drive failure as discussed on this Arch Linux forum thread\nNormally, errors say what's wrong ergo buffer I/O error on device sda5, logical block\n\nA: I too have an older HP laptop, a DV9000 if it matters, and I agree it's a good match for Ubuntu.  I'm sorry to hear you've run into difficulty, and even more sorry to say I suspect I know what the problem might be, and that it might be terminal.  The best way to find out is to see if it boot's to a live CD.  If it does, then that's very good news.  If it does not, as I fear, then your laptop may have succumbed to a problem common to many laptops regardless of brand but particularly common to HP laptops which were the subject of a recall some years ago.\nMany HP laptops contain high performance graphics chipsets which are prone to overheating.  It is my impression that this feature is compounded by the performance increase ubuntu offers.  As windows tends to essentially run about half as well on PCs as compared to Linux, the graphics in turn run slower.  Double the speed and, well, double the heat.\nThe good news is that if your laptop is one of the recalled models then it is very possible you can still cash in on the recall and get the entire unit replaced free of charge!\nLet me know how the live cd boot goes and we'll take it from there.\n", "Q: I want to play minecraft I can't install anything from the Ubuntu Software Center. \nFor example, I tried to install Java but I couldn't and don't say to install it off Google; I have tried installing Java from Google but it still does not work.\n\nA: \nHere's how I did it:\nInstall java 8 separately, without messing with system java:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest jdk 8 .tar.gz from Oracle.\n\n\n*Extract the .tar.gz to /opt/java:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/java\n$ sudo tar -C /opt/java -xzf Downloads/jdk-8[tab]\n\n\n*Create a link to the java executable:\n$ sudo ln -s /opt/java/jdk1.8[tab]/bin/java /usr/local/bin/java8\n\nMinecraft:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Minecraft.jar from Mojang.\n\n\n*Start Minecraft:\n$ java8 -jar Downloads/Minecraft.jar\n\n\n*Once Minecraft has started, select \"Lock to Launcher\" in the launcher to create a persistent Minecraft launcher.\n\nFor extra credit, create a script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in the following commands:\n$ mkdir -p ~/bin\n$ cat > ~/bin/minecraft\n\n\n*Type in script payload:\n#! /bin/sh\njava8 -jar ~/Downloads/Minecraft.jar\n\n\n*Press Control+D to signal end of file.\n\n\n*Make script executable:\n$ chmod +x bin/minecraft\n\n, and a desktop entry:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in the following command:\n$ cat > ~/.local/share/applications/minecraft.desktop\n\n\n*Type in desktop file payload:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Minecraft\nIcon=Pictures/minecraft.png\nExec=minecraft\nStartupNotify=false\n\n\n*Press Control+D to signal end of file.\n\n\n*Find a suitable minecraft icon image.\n\n\n*Copy image to Pictures/ (assuming .png format):\n$ cp PathToImageFile.png Pictures/minecraft.png\n\nNow you can start Minecraft with the command  \"minecraft\". The launcher should show the minecraft icon you copied to Pictures/. As before, select \"Lock to Launcher\" to persist your launcher.\n\n\nA: I suspect I know why you are having difficulty installing anything directly from the software center.  I can only assume that you are operating from a standard, which is to say, not administrator account.  This often happens when someone trusts their relative or friend to install Ubuntu for them, and that other person issues the newbie a less-than-administrator account simply trying to keep them out of trouble.  In such a case, the terminal won't work for you either, so don't even try that.\nSo, long story short, you first need to get into the administrative account, or persuade your installer to upgrade you to an administrator (or perhaps get your own computer if you are using his/hers)\nOrdinarily the software center is the safest way to install anything under ubuntu.  I would never advise you (or anyone else) to install it off google.  There seems to be a popular view on this site that all software must be installed from the command line.  I realize that's the legacy of linux, but not one anyone should feel compelled to follow.\nThere are two legit ways I'm aware of to install the real, original, pay-for version of minecraft under ubuntu, and I believe only one of them requires installing the windows emulator.  The windows emulator can be entirely installed through the software center and I can walk you through that, but in this case I'm not convinced that's necessarily the better way.\nYour other two alternatives are easy and won't cost you a cent, although you will still need administrative privileges.  Under the Ubuntu Software Center you have two free versions of minecraft-like games.  I believe they are called MineTest and MyCraft.  From what I've read of the former, it offers some options not offered in the original game.  It also has the benefit that you can persuade your friends to sign up without incurring expense for them.\n", "Q: Difference between commands for removing empty directories What is the difference between rm --dir <directory> and rmdir <directory> with respect to removing empty directories? \nAlso, if they are similar, is there any advantage of having an rmdir command considering that it is limited only to the removal of empty directories and that the rm command can achieve the same functionality (and a lot more) with its numerous options?\n\nA: rmdir removes empty directories, not files, and not directories unless they are empty.\nrm will remove files and/or directories, use the -R or -r flag for directories.\nTo remove non-empty directories: rm -rf\nthe option --dir is the same as -d , it will remove empty directories, same as rmdir\nAs far as I know the commands do the same thing and it is user preference which one you use, personally, I use\nrm -rf\n\nI also alias rm to rm -i\nCareful with that command. It is unforgiving if you make a mistake, especially when combined with sudo (which is why I alias it to rm -i, the -f overrides the -i).\nI suppose rmdir might be safer in that it will not remove a directory unless it is empty first, forcing you to review the contents first.\n", "Q: Connecting Arduino with eth0 while leaving wlan0 for Internet I have a simple Arduino HTTP Server and I want to browse this server from my Ubuntu.\nIf I assign to Arduino an IP 192.168.0.9 and I connect the Arduino HTTP Server to my router (to any of the 4 ethernet ports), all works fine and I can browse from my Ubuntu\nUbuntu => wlan0 => router => Arduino HTTP Server\nI assume all is ok because I assigned a static IP to Arduino, and so it sits in the same subnet 192.168.0.0/24.  \nIn my notebook there is also an eth0.

It runs Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.10. After my last update, which included an update of my NVIDIA drivers, if I'm not mistaken, I'm no longer able to access my desktop.\nI should add that my TV, which is connected as a second monitor via HDMI, is not receiving any signal.\nI get a regular boot sequence followed by my login screen but when I enter my password, all that happens is I get a blank desktop background... the one with Ubuntu 14.10 stamped on it... no Launcher, no desktop, no way to shut down.\nAs an aside, windows continues to function normally, both monitors are fine.\nAny help would be most appreciated. Anyone else having a similar problem?\n\nA: If your computer is configured such that you are offered a purple screen at boot time with choices to boot a previous version, you may be able to boot successfully, and once in, uninstall or alter your nvidia drivers.  I've read that if you are not automatically offered that menu, that booting with the shift key held down will force that menu to appear.\nIf you need help reconfiguring or disabling your nvidia drivers I can offer you tips which have worked for me though I don't claim to be an expert.\n", "Q: Landscape OpenStack Installation Requirements Checklist I'm trying a Openstack Install using Landscape, with MAAS and a set of KVM/virt-manager virtual machines.\nThe VMs have worked well with MAAS, and the Landscape install on a VM successfully completed. \nLogging into Landscape, my checklist looks like this:\nRegistered a MAAS region controller (green checkmark)\nConnection to the MAAS region controller available (green checkmark)\nAt least 5 machines with more than one disk have been commissioned (red X)\nAt least one of the commissioned machines, with mutliple disks must also have multiple network connections (greyed-out checkmark) \nMy first attempt - I didn't have the required VMs in a Ready state in MAAS. I added them, hoping that Landscape would detect them and let me proceed.  5 in all with 2 virtual disks and one of the 5 with 2 MAAS networks.  But that didn't help. So I reinstalled a Landscape VM, thinking maybe it needed to have them ready up front. No luck there either. The 3rd part of the checklist sounds like it's successful, but, why the red X? \n\nA: Not a 100% complete answer since I may need more details.  Please comment here if you have anything updated you need me to look at.  But, I think this could be your issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*The checklist is dynamic, it will compute again when you reload the page.  You will not need to re-install landscape.  I suspect you probably did try to reload the page already -- I'm just putting this here so it's clear.\n\n*The red X is letting you know that landscape or MAAS thinks the machine doesn't have enough disks.  This information is parsed from the lshw tool.\n\n*Since I've hit this before, I suspect you are running into: https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1355309\nCould you please make sure your disks are not using the virtio driver and try again?  You will need to re-commission in MAAS, perhaps re-enlist (delete, re-add).  This is just a setting in the VM, so changing it there at least is easy, but in MAAS the hardware information needs to be refreshed.\nThe good news is: if you have landscape installed and at the checklist, you should not need to go through that process again.\n", "Q: How to Install NVIDIA Cuda without EULA/prompts?

Are there any disadvantages to making it a micro instance instead? What instance would be ideal in terms of cost and performance? (I may be running a storm topology on AWS via JuJu, if that helps. Don't know how large the cluster will be yet.)\n2) JuJu bootstrap node on AWS has a 8GiB data volume automatically attached to it.  Is this necessary? What is it used for? Is there a way to deploy a bootstrap node without this data volume attached/alter the type of data volume?\nI couldn't find any info. on these questions within the JuJu docs online.\n\nA: Since there's no such thing as a \"tiny\" I assume you mean a micro sized instance. t2.micro's are burstable, and we've found through experience that micros are just too underpowered to run a bootstrap/state-server node. \nIf you're looking to save on cost then what you can do is run a workload on the bootstrap node, so that you effectively share a machine as both a coordination node and use it for real work. Perhaps also consider running Juju in HA mode so that you have a state server on multiple-nodes: \nhttps://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/controllers-ha\nThis way you don't waste nodes but you don't have all your eggs in one basket either. \nI'm not sure on the data volume, I'll ask and add that information when I get it. \n", "Q: How do you put programs on your desktop?

I have tried Hardinfo and sensors, but they don't look to meet what I'm looking for.\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10 64 Bits.\n\nA: Many modern computer components contain thermal sensors, including but not limited to the CPU, hard drive, and even motherboards, although to be fair, motherboards did it first.  Display cards may or may not include them but they should as they are usually the first to die from overheating.\nThat said, it has never been my experience that commonplace network cards monitor their temperature, nor have I known them to overheat.  They do die however, a behavior I assume is caused by power surges over the ethernet cabling, and sometimes by poor chipset quality.  \nIf your ethernet card appears to be flakey, it could well be the card itself.  Still more likely is that your router needs to be reset, is dying, or is of poor quality.  I see failing routers with some frequency.  Some routers with big reputations caused by heavy advertising are terribly unreliable.  D-Link and Linksys come to mind first. Most Netgear routers are bulletproof, and Ironically they often cost half as much retail, and can cost a quarter the store price if you order refurbished netgear routers online, which is something I do quite frequently for my friends.\nTo get back to your original question, if your goal is to monitor any temperature inside your pc, your best bet is to go in search of a self-illuminated front panel temperature monitor and attach the wired thermistor included with the kit to whatever components inside your pc.  Many of these are configured to monitor four components such as your display card and some of them even offer outputs for variable speed cooling fans.  I probably don't have to tell you these devices are aimed primarily at overclockers obsessed with gaming, but they can just as well be applied to sensible people concerned to reliability and system longevity.\nI apologize if I seem to issue TMI, but I beg of you to please understand I do not do this to brag, but rather to give you all information which will help ensure your success.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 touchscreen not recognized anymore on XPS 15 9530 Haswell I've a Dell XPS 15 with Ubuntu 14.10 and I've just realized that my touchscreen does not work anymore.

I can access the router website and get a wired connection message but firefox cannot find the internet\n\nA: This kind of problem is probably not a problem with Ubuntu, rather with the router. Because this is a problem with the router, I would check out your router's User Manual, as there are setup instructions in there. If D-Link didn't include a print copy of the User Manual with your Router, here's a link to it: \nI assume that you can view the PDF in some way, because you have to be connected to the internet to post to AskUbuntu.\nYou will have to reset your router before proceeding with the initial setup instructions in the manual. If you can not find a reset button in your router's configuration tool, there should be a reset button on the router.\nOff-topic, but why are you still using Ubuntu 11.10? If you want to minimalize system upgrades, you can go to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or you can stay at Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and still be fine for a while.\n\nA: to find your router. open settings (icon of gear and wrench) open icon marked \"network\" and look for the heading marked \"default route\".  Copy the default route and then paste it into a your browser.  It should take you to the router\nIf you have not changed the login the user should be either admin or user and the password may simply be pressing enter.  It is hard to tell.  I hate DLINKS as they are unreliable, short lived, and they are very inconsistent about things like logging in.  If someone offers you their old one of any other brand, even belkin, by all  means please take it.  I can help you order a netgear for only about $10.\nIf you don't need a router right now, please just connect your computer directly to the broadband modem until you can replace that piece of junk.\n", "Q: Sage installation failed on Ubuntu10.04 I am trying to install sage-6.4.1-x86_64-Linux on my Ubuntu 10.04(32bit). But this installation failed:\n\nHow can I install it? Please help.\n\nA: Get the 32-bit installer from http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/sagemath/sage-mirror/linux/32bit/index.html or another repository. You must install 32-bit apps only on a 32-bit operating system; the original install failed because you can't install 64-bit code on a 32-bit OS.\n", "Q: Install second mysql I have a VM that has mysql 5.5.40 installed in it. And now i want to install mysql 5.6 without updating or replacing existing version. Means i want to use these two side by side.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried to install with apt-get install mysql-server-5.6 but it was replaced/upgraded the existing one.\n\n*Also tried it with the deb file result was same as above.\n\n*Last i used compressed tar file.

It fails on pid when i try to run it.\nDid i miss something with these 3 options?\nIs there any other way to do it?\n\nA: You could compile mysql 5.6 from source with ./configure --prefix=/opt/mysql56\nmake\nmake install\n if it still uses autoconf.\nYou would also have to change the port number.\nBut i think it would be much easier to have mysql 5.6 in a separate virtual machine, using virt-manager (kvm), vmware ore virtualbox.\n", "Q: deploy JuJu charm on AWS without data storage Every time I deploy a charm from JuJu onto AWS, it creates the EC2 instance, but it also automatically attaches a 8GiB data volume to the instance.  I can't find documentation about how to configure the data volume.  Is there a way to not attach the data volume and how? Is there a way to specify the data volume size? \n\nA: See the juju documentation for setting constraints\nI don't believe that there is a way to deploy juju without a disk attached, however you can set the size of the node by setting the --constraints root-disk flag.\n", "Q: Can I make a boot drive with my desktop I want to make a boot drive with all of the system files the same as the files on my desktop. I want to just plug it in and have it boot up with all my settings and files and everything running when I log in.\nI've created a boot disk on the flash drive I want to use but I can't copy my desktop's file system to the flash drive's while its running, and the drive's file system doesn't look anything like the system on the computer when running from my desktop. Instead of having the \"bin,boot,cdrom,etc.\" the flash drive has \"boot,casper,dists,EFI,etc.\" \nIs there a way that I can just copy all the files from my computer to the flash drive to make them the same?\n\nA: Try taking a look at this: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/creating-custom-ubuntu-live-cd-with-remastersys.html.  Be careful, though I have never done this and I advise you to proceed with caution.\n", "Q: battery charging problem My problem reappeared again.  \nI have a Lenovo G780 which originally came with Windows 8 installed, and its power management would charge the battery up to 60%, but Windows crashed, and it was replaced with Ubuntu 14.04. If the battery drains to 0%, I can't boot up the system.\n\nA: Draining the battery to 0% charge likely will cause any laptop with any OS to fail to boot. Recharge it completely, and then boot up. \nAnd, since you're new here, please make sure to select the best answer provided and click on that answer's checkmark so they get the gratification of knowing they helped.\n\nA: This is a laptop hardware issue, not an ubuntu issue.  I will explain.  Generally speaking, Lenovos are the most well supported of all brands of computers when it comes to all distributions of Linux, so I would be very surprised if it were say, a matter of a driver.\nNow if you open, this link, you will find that quite a few people share your exact complaint, practically word for word.  When I did this search, I even found one hit, the fourth I believe, which indicated it had been solved, though I admit having opened that hit I can't claim I'm clear about the solution.\nEither way, it looks as though the problem may be due to an ACPI device driver, cmos setting, or even bios flaw which can be solved by means of an update to your bios. If I were you I'd carefully inspect my acpi settings in my cmos settings.  I might try taking the battery out and putting it back in. \n", "Q: How are Ubuntu packages structured? When I download a package in Ubuntu, what files does it install on my system and where?  I'm just curious about the package structure in general (I searched and it doesn't look like anyone's asked this on here before).  It will obviously differ to some extent from package to package, but I'm guessing there must be some 'standard' guidelines that are followed?\nAlso, are the packages in the Software Center the same as the packages that are available through apt-get?  If not, how can I see what packages are available in apt-get and what they do?\n\nA: *\n\n*Once you have installed a package, it is possible to see what files that package has installed on your system.  You can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*with the graphical synaptic package manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*install synaptic (it is not installed by default).  Use apt-get install synaptic, or install it through Software Center. I like it better than the Software Center, but YMMV.\n\n*finding the package in question (try typing the name or a keyword in the search bar)\n\n*right-click on an installed package (green square next to package), \n\n*select Properties\n\n*click on the \"Installed Files\" tab\n\n\n*with command line tools (see this question)\n\n\n*\n\n*(once) install apt-file: sudo apt-get install apt-file\n\n*(once) apt-file update\n\n*(for any package) apt-file list \n\n\n\n*Yes, the packages in the software center are (edit: mostly) the same as those in apt-get.  The repositories that ubuntu gets software from are configured in a common location (System Settings -> Software & Updates).  apt-get, synaptic, the Ubuntu Software Center, etc... all use that system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit: The dpkg subsystem is what is actually responsible for installation and removal of packages.  Synaptic, the Software Center, and apt-get all use this to actually perform operations.  This means that these three methods are all views into the same set of data about installed packages.  \n\n*the only caveat: the Software Center can have apps in it that cost money, and synaptic and apt-get will not be able to install these packages as they have no payment mechanism in them.  There thus are apps available in the Software Center that are not available by synaptic or apt-get.  I believe (but am not 100% positive) that Software Center still uses dpkg under the hood to install these packages after they have been paid for, meaning the apt tools and synaptic will see them at that point.\n\n*Just for clarity, it is of course possible with root access to modify the system any way you wish, including manually installing software that is not contained in a .deb package file. Software installed outside of the dpkg system in this fashion will not be visible by any of the package management tools I mentioned.\n\nA: I would suggest to use dpkg from the command line (shell). The good thing about it is that it is already installed on your system, because apt-get is just an extension built around dpkg. apt-get handles checking for available packages, checking for updates, downloading the packages, but dpkg is the command that actually handles the package installs, removes, etc.\nIn order to get a list of all installed packages, you can run dpkg -l. And in order to list all files in a given package, you run dpkg -L <pkg_name>, for example:\ndpkg -L zerofree\n/.\n/usr\n/usr/share\n/usr/share/man\n/usr/share/man/man8\n/usr/share/man/man8/zerofree.8.gz\n/usr/share/doc\n/usr/share/doc/zerofree\n/usr/share/doc/zerofree/copyright\n/usr/share/doc/zerofree/changelog.Debian.gz\n/usr/sbin\n\nAs already explained by @stochastic, the sources of packages on your system are the same, regardless of whether you use the GUI or command line tools. The actual configuration files are in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.\nNote that dpkg does not understand online repositories, it can work with packages that are already installed on the system or packages (.deb) that you have downloaded manually.\n", "Q: How do I get clean boot after fresh side by side install? I was running Windows 7 Pro (32 bit) OS on my Dell Dimension 9100. I attempted to load (side by side) Ubuntu 14.04.1 desktop.  The install appeared to work properly into a 19 GB partition.  When completed, the restart (reboot) brought up the following message.\nerror: no such device: e4958c47-7613-4ca4-82d6-b80ffc2b2148\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue>\n\nEven after removing the Ubuntu with OS-Uninstaller, the above message returns on every boot.\nSo how do I get back to a Windows 7 boot?\n\nA: I'd imagine you will need a windows disc, start windows installer via the boot menu, and then run boot repair.\nI don't know if something like Ultimate boot cd or system rescue cd will work as I've never had a need to use them.\nBTW, its called dual boot not side-by-side. Apparently, it looks like you didn't do it correctly.\n", "Q: Is installing a different distro over ubuntu on a dualboot system possible? Or deleting partition necessarily? I run a dualboot with ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8.1. I messed up the ubuntu and now I'm going to install elementary OS instead of ubuntu. I wounder how I should do it in the easiest way possible without mess upp something. Should I first just delete the partition where I have ubuntu on and then create a new partition in windows and on that new partition install elementary OS?\nOr can I install elementary distro over the current ubuntu distro and that partition with ubuntu will be overwritten with the installation of elementary OS? So the partition will be like a clean partition with just elementary on it instead of ubuntu? I mean this would be possible if I were to reinstall ubuntu right? So is it possible when I choose to install another distro?\nIf I had to remove the partition at first will that give some problem to start windows then? I mean I know have a \"bootmeny\" in grub where I can choose either windows or ubuntu from. But windows have it's own so that problem shouldn't occour?\n\nA: This is not really an Ubuntu question, but an Elementary OS question, but Elementary comes with its own version of grub, so I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a full system backup using CloneZilla\n\n*Take another backup with your current backup\n\n*Boot Elementary OS, delete the Ubuntu system partition\n\n*Recreate a new partition with the same settings as the Ubuntu partition\n\n*be sorry to let go Ubuntu.  ;-)\n\n", "Q: Libjpeg not found I have an binary program to run on ubuntu.

However, I do have a\n/usr/lib/vmware-installer/2.1.0/lib/lib/libjpeg.so.62/libjpeg.so.62 on my 14.04 system, so maybe you have something similar (I have vmplayer installed).

The problem seems to be that information about some package in /var/lib/dpkg/status does not valid UTF-8 encoding, and this causes the crash.  \n", "Q: \"ERROR MESSAGE: Requires installation of untrusted packages\" I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 in VirtualBox 4.3.20.

I tried simply right-clicking the generated binary and using the 'Make Link' option, but the link crashes when clicked outside of the build directory. \nLastly, I realize there's a perfectly good distribution of Blender in the software center, but I am weird and I wanted to build it from source.\n\nA: As I recall, Blender's make install generally does not actually put itself in system executable directories.  \nMy suggestion would be to use the .local folder in your home directory (or create it if it isn't there)\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir -p ~/.local/opt\n\n*copy the blender source code into that directory, giving you something like ~/.local/opt/blender\n\n*mkdir -p ~/.local/bin: create a bin directory where you can put your own executable files\n\n*Edit your .bashrc file: gedit ~/.bashrc\nat the end of that file, put this line: export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}\nThis will prepend ~/.local/bin to your PATH environment variable.\n\n*For this edit to take effect, you will need to do source ~/.bashrc for any shell that is already running.  Any new terminal that you start after saving the edited file will have the new PATH already.  If you want to be able to run blender from the gui using Alt-F2 you will need to restart (or perhaps just log out and log in again, not sure).  You can check to see if this folder is on your path by typing echo ${PATH}, and ensuring that /home/youruser/.local/bin is at the beginning\n\n*symbolic link the blender executable that you built into this bin directory:  ln -s ~/.local/opt/blender/<blender executable> ~/.local/bin/blender\nNow, when you type blender at the command line, the program should run.\n", "Q: Ubuntu shaky display problem Good afternoon, I recently got the lenovo y70 touch laptop and got it ready for Linux, however, Ubuntu has a display problem where the screen looks like it's shaking or tearing, I've tried nvidia drivers to no avail. The strange thing is that on distros that don't support touch out of the box like crunchbang and elementary OS don't have this issue, but have a lot less out of the box features compared to Ubuntu so I'd rather use Ubuntu. Any ideas?\n\nA: Maybe the display is not the problem. Maybe it is the input device which is part of the screen the Nvidia drivers are rendering to. Check the HID devices which might be present for your touch screen to provide system input. Or, check which ones should be present, anyway, and make sure they are. If you have a mouse and a track pad and a keyboard joystick and a touch screen, try disabling them all, and enabling one at a time to see if they are interfering with each other. \n\nA: Upgrade to kernel 3.18 — or 3.19, see below —, that solved the problem for me.\nI have a Lenovo Y70, like you. And Linux Mint 17.1 which is based on Ubuntu 14.04. Installing the latest NVIDIA drivers had no effect, only upgrading to kernel 3.18 worked. Kernel 3.16 didn't work.\nUnfortunately, my wireless network card doesn't work with 3.18 :-(  So I just installed kernel 3.19. That one seems to have solved both the shaky display issue, and works with the Y70 wireless network card. So the fourth kernel I tested worked :-) Last time, with Linux Mint 17, I had to try 3 different kernels before the network card was happy.\nThis is how I installed 3.19. Perhaps you'd need to use other URLs if new patch versions have been released.\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.19-vivid/linux-headers-3.19.0-031900-generic_3.19.0-031900.201502091451_amd64.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.19-vivid/linux-headers-3.19.0-031900_3.19.0-031900.201502091451_all.deb\nwget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.19-vivid/linux-image-3.19.0-031900-generic_3.19.0-031900.201502091451_amd64.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.19.*  linux-image-3.19.*.deb\nsudo update-grub  # not needed?\nsudo reboot now\n\n", "Q: gzip: stdin: not in gzip format when gunzip is used with pipe I uncompress file in the following way:\n\ngunzip file.gz\n\nBut when I do it with pipe, it returns the error.\n\necho file.gz | gunzip\n  gzip: stdin: not in gzip format\n\nWhat's the issue here? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The issue is that echo file.gz just echoes a string \"file.gz\". Basically the difference between the commands is:\nWhat you want:\ngunzip /path/to/directory/file.gz\nWhat you're giving it with the echo:\ngunzip \"file.gz\"\nHowever, even this isn't entirely correct. The true difference is that instead of a reference to the file file.gz you're sending in only the string \"file.gz\"\nI guess the real question here is why are you trying to pipe to gunzip instead of just using it as gunzip file.gz?\nEDIT: It seems that doing echo file.gz | xargs gunzip does the trick, as well.\n", "Q: How do install the latest version of Ubuntu on my HP Chromebook 14?

The language is called nesC, and it is basically derived from C, sharing the C structure as a result. \nI followed instructions on the Gnome wiki on how to create a new language.\nI copied the c.lang file and pasted it to ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs, and then made all necessary changes to the file to convert C to nesC.\nThe problem is that, when I open a file with the extension .nc, it is still in plain black colour. However, if I go to View → Highlight Mode → Sources, the nesC option is there and is already selected, which means that Gedit is detecting the file type. In that case, why are there no colours? When I select C from the sources I get the colours.\nI also created a mime type file as indicated in the Gnome wiki article on how to create a new language.\n\nIn the file, I changed id=c to id=nesc. If I change it back to id=c, then it works. Why should I not use nesc? The tutorial clearly changes the value (id=foo).\n\nA: You should change id attribute in 2 places, in the main tag <language> and tag <context> (child of <definitions>):\n…\n<language id=\"nesc\" _name=\"nesC\" version=\"2.0\" _section=\"Source\">\n  <metadata>\n    <property name=\"mimetypes\">text/x-nesc</property>\n    <property name=\"globs\">*.nesc;*.nc</property>\n  </metadata>\n  …\n\nand\n  …\n  <definitions>\n    <context id=\"nesc\">\n      …\n    </context>\n  </definitions>\n</language>`\n\n(But I do not know how have you named mime-type.)\n", "Q: Problem in making customized Kubuntu LiveCD I have planned to make a customized \"Kubuntu\" 14.04 LiveCD. For that, I tried using Ubuntu Customization Kit. Several attempts were made and built many custom kubuntu iso files but none of them were in a working state. Process to make the custom iso was successful  and no errors occured in build process and also, the writing of iso was performed correctly to USB. \nWhen booted with USB, I couldn't use it as a LiveUSB. So to track the actual fault, I installed it directly to Hard Drive. However it installed. But I couldn't login into the administrator account after installing that custom iso in my system. Only Guest was allowed to be accessed. \nAll the iso's created showed the same behaviour of being stuck, and hence I reinstalled back the Kubuntu again, that was available in the official website.\nWhen searched in the internet, I came to know that custom KDE(kubuntu) iso made with Ubuntu Customization Kit will have some glitches, as UCK was excellent in handling GNOME, LXDE whereas it is not good in handling KDE.\nThen googled out for other alternatives. I found Remastersys, Relinux, and Ubuntu Builder. Remastersys is discontinued and supports making custom LiveCD's upto Saucy Salamander. Ubuntu Builder is also a discontinued project. I cannot create custom iso using Relinux as it simply loops indefinitely i.e from start to end of config and goes back to starting of config. \nReason for creation of Custom ISO:\nI needed a backup of installed programs Cheese, GIMP, VLC, g++, build-essential, synaptic, XAMPP(installed manually from ApacheFriends) so that whenever I need a reinstallation, if installed with custom iso, I need not install again and again. \nLinks referred regarding this problem:\nHow to customize Ubuntu Live CD\nP.S. Is there any special software for KDE for making custom iso?\n\nA: Finally made my custom kubuntu iso with the same Ubuntu Customization Kit, but this time I did it with help of VirtualBox. \n\n\n*\n\n*First installed VirtualBox.  \n\n*Then inside it, I installed a fresh copy of Kubuntu. Inside that, I installed Ubuntu Customization Kit. Then copied Kubuntu iso file, selected and configured it for my needs with Ubuntu Customization Kit.  \n\n\nI tested it and it worked well.\n\nA: As your aim is just to have a total system backup, just use CloneZilla to make a clone (\"image\") of your system partition(s): 2 minutes of work, 30 minutes of waiting (depending on the size and speed of your computer)\nEven the set-up is easy: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hook up an external USB HD\n\n*Boot the CloneZilla CD\n\n*Clone partition using image (take the MBR too!)\n\n\nDone!\nIf your /home is not on a separate partition drop a note @Fabby\n", "Q: Is it possible to put a GUI to more than just TTY7? My question is pretty much the title. I often use TTYs for handling different matters in parallel. This could be for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*something local on TTY1\n\n*per SSH on ServerA on TTY2\n\n*per SSH on ServerB on TTY3\n\n*network surveillance on TTY4\n\n*desktop GUI on TTY7\n\n\nThere are cases however, when it would be nice to have 1 desktop each on different TTYs. Like for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*instance 1 with XFCE/Unity/Kde on TTY7\n\n*instance 2 with XFCE/Unity/Kde on TTY8\n\n\nIs that possible?\n\nA: Yes and no.\nSetting aside TTY/PTS parts of the conversation...\nYes you can run more then one Xorg instance. \nX :1\nX :2\nX :3\nwould start 3 new Xorg sessions on display ports 1,2, and 3\nYou can run damn near any command by setting the DISPLAY variable.\nso DISPLAY=:1 xterm would start xterm on display port 1\nYour \"default\" desktop is display port 0 (:0)\nNow for the no part. \nUnity is not a great desktop environment. As much as some people like it it really departs from a lot of things that make Linux awesome. One of those things, is that it assumes that it will be only running once. So starting Unity on many display ports usually produces tons of errors as both \"environments\" fight over settings and such. \nKDE used to have the same problem (it still might).  XFCE and other \"more traditional\" desktop environments usually work fine, or at the very least, work as one instance per user logged in. \nSo yes you can run several GUI sessions at once in different TTY/PTY and access them by pressing CTRL+ALT+F7-F12 (depending on kernel settings).\n\nA: Yes you may start a new GUI in a different TTY. From the default Ubuntu TTY (number 7), switch to another TTY (number 3 in this example) by pressing:\nCtrl+Alt+F3\nProvide your username and password and then start a new X session, using the same number of the present TTY:\nstartx -- :3\n\n", "Q: What's the minimum disk space requirement for Ubuntu Server?

I personally encrypted the message before sending it to myself.\nI have been trying now for hours to solve this. I have reinstalled Enigmail a couple of times. I also reinstalled GnuPG a couple of times. I deleted all my keys and reimported them. What drives me especially crazy is, that I have another Laptop using Enigmail with the very same public-private key pair and there everything works just fine.\nWhat makes me suspicious is that 0xMYKEYCODE from the error message is different from the code of my public-private key pair in my key manager, how can this be? \nThanks a lot in advance and cheers,\nRobert\nEDIT: Maybe this helps: I can not sign messages on the computer that cannot decrypt, but I can sign on my other machine. So, apparently Enigmail cannot use my private key, why?\nEDIT2: If I try to sign a message, it refuses with the failure \"Error - wrong passphrase\". That got me thinking, after re-importing all my keys, I was never ever asked to provide the passphrase that secures my public-private key pair anywhere!?\nEDIT3: If I evoke\necho RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent\n\non the laptot where encryption works, it tells me that gpg-connect-agent is not installed??? Could it be that on the laptop where it works the keys are actually managed by the gnome key ring (despite Enigmail telling me that they are managed by gpg-agent)? \nHowever, on the laptop where the decryption no longer works, I can evoke echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent. Thus gpg is taking care and maybe makes a mess in combination with the gnome key ring?\n\nA: I had this problem on OSX with gpg v2 and fixed it by installing gpg v1 alongside it. Not sure if this is applicable to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Ok I had a very simple solution to that.\nWhen sending mails to myself they were automatically encrypted. When I wanted to open them I had the same error.\nSidenote:\nThey were automatically encrypted as my mailadress was known to my mail client and assigned a key.\nSolution:\nUncheck something like \"never ask for passphrase\" in the enigmail settings. And then open the mail again and type in the correct passphrase.\nAdditional info:\nI thought enigmail with thunderbird was dumb so I used the commandline instead and tried to figure out my passwort by decrypting the message there with gpg --decrypt <Message>. Oddly when I typed in the correct password it didn't showed me the encrypted mail. However, in thunderbird it did then.\n\nA: In my case, setting useGpgAgent to true actually fixed my problem. Thunderbird version 38.5.1, Enigmail 1.8.2 (20150416-1748), gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.28, libgcrypt 1.6.3.\n\nA: You're missing the private keys. Reinstalling GnuPG and Enigmail probably won't help, as this is a problem with your GnuPG key ring.\nIt seems somehow your private key ring got corrupted. Recover a working version of ~/.gnupg from your backups. If you haven't got one, (start doing so now and) fetch the keys from your other computer, either by copying the whole ~/.gnupg folder, or by exporting the private key:\ngpg --export-secret-keys [keyid] > secret-keys.pgp\n\nand importing it on the computer with the broken keys:\ngpg --import secret-keys.pgp\n\nIt might happen you have to delete the key before.\n\nA: Ok, so I kind of figured it out. After setting useGpgAgent to false in the Thunderbird configuration and several restarts plus system updates later everything works again. \nI think this is a very unsatisfying answer because I couldn't figure out what was actually causing the problem. I can only guess that gpg-agent doesn't work well with the gnome-keyring as well as the seahorse key manager (apparently both were installed by Ubuntu automatically when I set up the OS for the first time).\n\nA: Having the exact same issue on Ubuntu 14.10/GNOME 3.12.\nuseGpgAgent was already set to false for me (in fact I didn't have have GpgAgent installed until just now) and my system is fully upgraded, so I'm afraid smCaterpillar's solution won't help me.\nI've deleted the public and private keys from .gnupg, set useGpgAgent and useGpgKeytools to their respective defaults, disabled the thunderbird GNOME keyring integration extension, and I'm hoping a that similar to smCaterpillar a few restarts will do the trick.\nEDIT: It just occured to me to \"clear saved passphrase\" from the Enigmail menu. Weirdly, Thunderbird/Enigmail tells me it cannot delete the password because I'm using GPG Agent to manage passwords. However, useGpgAgent is set to false and GPG Agent is not running.\n\nA: I went into 'Edit Per-recipient Rules' and created a rule that will not encrypt nor sign emails I send to myself. \nFor the emails I could not decrypt I copied the email bodies into individual text files. \nThen, from the directory where I place them I entered\ncat filename.txt | sudo gpg --decrypt in the terminal to see the contents of the problem emails after supplying my paraphrase filename.txt was replaced by the name of each file in  turn.\n\nA: I had the same problem: Enigmail said it couldn't find the secret key, but gpg -d just worked fine.\nI then discovered that I used had a custom pinentry-program defined in .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf (in my case pinentry-qt4), which I didn't have on a new installation. Removing that line or installing pinentry-qt4 solved the problem for me.\nIn that case, the enigmail error message should be more specific.\n", "Q: No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda I just did a boot-repair because I can't run windows 8.1 from the grub (I see many options but none works) and I got this result:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9558801/\nMy question is : Should I care about the following message :\nNo boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n\nIs it the origin of the problem?\n\nA: Looks like you are using UEFI booting and GPT partitions (the newer way). So you can ignore the message about the missing MBR.\nI suggest running gparted and checking if your /dev/sda2 partition has the boot flag. For some reason, that seems like a common problem. I've answered a similar question previously.\n\nA: Problem solved!\nI just had to disable Secure boot in the bios and now I can boot both in Linux (Lubuntu) and Windows.\nI still have 5 entries for Windows, some work, others don't and I don't know why...

I've downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu and used a USB as the boot option. Before this, I partitioned my HDD into a 800GB drive and a 200GB drive (the latter to be used for Linux). I changed the boot priority order in the BIOS so that it would boot from the USB first, which lead me to a Ubuntu installer screen at which point I selected \"Install Ubuntu\". I am now left with a loading screen which isn't showing any signs of progress that looks like: \nhttp://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg558/squiffyk7/Ubuntuscreen.png\nHow could I get out of this without corrupting my laptop?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: There are a couple reasons this could be happening. \n\n\nFirst, be sure to format your USB completely, I recommend using Rufus to create the flash drive as it formats it as well as makes the bootable USB for you.\nSecondly, be sure that you give plenty of time for the loading screen to work. Depending on your hardware it could take up to an hour or more. On my laptop it took about 45 minutes to initialize.\nThird, be sure download the proper ISO and check the md5sum. I have noticed many times in the past that the ISO will affect the install. Either an incomplete download, or corrupted version of the ISO can cause this issue. When you download the ISO ensure you are using a wired connection.\n\n\nThis should resolve your issue, but the two main points would be to use Rufus to create the bootable USB drive, and to ensure you are using wired internet when downloading the ISO.\n\nA: Try:  Use the f12 for boot order or another key. (Should be that key for acer)\nAlso try another USB installer.   Universal usb installer is good.\nUsing a pre-installed ubuntu to make a startup disk is also good.\nClick on \"format disk\" to format it even if the disk is clean. \nThis makes a bootable disk.\nSometimes a pop up windown comes up when installing software and it may be behind another window.  This is unlikely for your case, but it happens when you are in ubuntu or windows.  An example is installing wine and the Microsoft fonts popular window.\nLimit your persistence to 1gb and then 0 if that does not work. \nIt should take less than 3 minutes to boot.  1 minute is more likely.  It depends on how big the persistence disk is. \nI had a similar boot problem with a friend's computer last night and making a universal installer worked.\n", "Q: Can not view fan speed rpm in hp 4530s laptop Output of sensors is:\n~$ sensors\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +31.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp2:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp3:        +31.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp4:        +31.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp5:        +31.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp6:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +51.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +85.0°C)\nCore 0:         +51.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +85.0°C)\nCore 1:         +51.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +85.0°C)\n\nAnd output of sensor detect is:\nsudo sensors-detect \n[sudo] password for vahid: \n# sensors-detect revision 6170 (2013-05-20 21:25:22 +0200)\n# System: Hewlett-Packard HP ProBook 4530s [A0001D02] (laptop)\n# Board: Hewlett-Packard 167C\n\nThis program will help you determine which kernel modules you need\nto load to use lm_sensors most effectively.

Would it be safe to use Dropbox for this file?\n\nA: If you mean a KeePass password file, there are several arguments to decide where to store it. In my opinion, if the passwords are really, really important to you, you should make the decision based on:\n\n\n*\n\n*The risk of the file being hacked\nAssuming you have a strong password to open the file, you may assume the KeePass file is rather safe (also see the tip of @gertvdijk at the bottom), however:\nIf the time to attempt to hack the file is unlimited, everything can be hacked A location that is (potentially) publically accessible to others is not a good idea, Dropbox or other clouds included.\nYou should also make sure others will not be able to copy the file for \"further processing\".\n\n*The risk of losing the file because of disk errors.\nOne thing is sure: there comes an end to the life of all disks. That means you should at least have a backup of your file on a (physically) other location. \n\n*The risk of burglary / fire\nIt sounds a bit overkill, but if you use your passwords in a professional (e.g. services to others) environment, and passwords include access to private data of others, you should make sure you also have a backup of the file on another (secure) location, so that you can at least change passwords quickly in case of accidents.\nIf I go on vacation, I make a backup of all my important data and keep it in a safe on another address.\nAltogether it is hard to tell you what is the best location. It depends on how important the file is to you, if your responsibility includes responsibility to others, how accessible your computer is to others etc. You should make your own decision, but  IMO based on your personal consideration of the risks above.\n\nTip: \nConsider increasing the 'Encryption Rounds' setting in the database settings. This brings down the feasibility of a brute-force attack on your master password down by increasing the CPU cycles needed for each password attempt and therefore reducing the risk of the actual (decrypted, plain) contents of your Keepass database being compromised.\n\n\nA: Just store it anywhere.\nMake duplicates of it.\nYou can upload it every where BUT make your key file common file.\nFor example. a picture of your pet. just like that.\nThat picture can be mixed with other picture or file.

Is it possible to run a task or script started from terminal at the background?\n\nA: There are multiple answers here, depending on what you want (this answer is valid in bash and zsh shells, others may vary).\nIf you need to run a command in background and you know it before running it, simply add a & at the end of the command (using sleep 60, do nothing during 1 minute, as example command): \n[romano:~] % sleep 60 &\n[1] 9054\n1& [romano:~] %\n\nIf you have already run it, you can stop it with ctrl-Z, and when the shell gives you a prompt, you can background it with the command bg: \n1& [romano:~] % sleep 60  \n^Z\n[1]  + 9084 suspended  sleep 60\n1z [romano:~] 20 % bg\n[1]  + 9084 continued  sleep 60\n1& [romano:~] % \n\nIn both cases, the process/job is still attached to your terminal; if you close your terminal a hangup (HUP) signal is sent to the process --- most process will gracefully exit then. If you need to ensure that the process will continue, you can either start it with:\nnohup sleep 60 & \n\nor, after having sent it to background with bg or with a simple &, tell the shell to forget about it, with: \ndisown %% \n\n(%% is a job control shortcut, and here stands for the last process sent in background). \nThen you have to take account of the output of the process --- in the first two cases the output will still arrive to the terminal; in the case of nohup it will be diverted on a file called nohup.out, and in the latter case (with disown) it will go to the terminal unless you close it, in which case the behavior is quite undefined. It is good practice to take care yourself of the output of a background process using redirection.\n\nA: add & to the command.\nExample:\n$ cp FromA ToB &\n\n\nA: This example will run updates in the background:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y &\n\nJust note the singe &.\nIf you want to hide the stdout, do following:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y > /dev/null &\n\n\nA: If you want it more advanced, and want to be able to use the session later locally or by SSH, you can use screen.\n# screen\n# apt-get update -y\n\nThen press CTRL+A followed by D.\nLater you can reattach:\n# screen -rd\n\n", "Q: How to fix Bluetooth related errors on boot When I boot my laptop, I see on the screen the following messages:\n[    5.307568] Bluetooth: Error in firmware loading err = -110,len = 448, size = 4096\n[    5.307601] Bluetooth: Loading patch file failed\n[    5.307624] ath3k: probe of 3-5:1.0 failed with error -110\n\nAll these messages seems to be Bluetooth related.\nHow can I fix these errors?

If there is a need to clean-up files due to the kill the command can do that. \n\n*SIGKILL sends a signal to the init system. The command itself does not get even told it is going to get killed.\n\n\nSo you can use both; but SIGTERM should be preferred (it is more graceful).\n\nWill “kill -SIGTERM” stop “tail -f”?\n\nYes, it will. On Linux tail acts on SIGTERM.\n\nA: You don't even have to use SIGTERM. tail listens for SIGINT and SIGQUIT too. I'm not sure if there's any difference between signals (it's all specific to tail) but any of these would be better than SIGKILL.\nIt's quite easy to test too:\n$ tail -f /dev/null > /dev/null &\n[1] 26599\n$ kill -SIGINT $!\n[1]+  Interrupt               tail -f /dev/null > /dev/null\n\n", "Q: Unable to reinstall MySQL What I did before this error:\nI was trying to install mysql for registration in OpenMRS database and it was succesfully, but i forgot my password.

Notes made in Excel or even earlier versions of Libre Office are using MS Sans Serif as standard font. This font is apparently no longer supported in the latest versions of Libre Office (don't know why ?). Any notes or other text written in this font is not displayed by those versions of Libre Office, allthough the text is present.\nYou can make this text visible again by clicking in the note, pressing +a (select all) and choosing a different font. At least, that's what helps for the Calc notes. \n\nA: Im not sure what caused the problem (probably using a template from MS-Office), but what solved it was Deleting every text box in the notes and adding new ones, created in Libre. \nThis way, the notes display correctly\n", "Q: How can I get a Windows game to run in windowed mode in Wine (when even explorer /desktop=[resolution] doesn't work)?

There's a partition on my drive that I don't use, called /dev/sda8.

I did the following:\n(global-set-key \"\\C-i\" 'isearch-forward)\n(global-set-key (kbd \"C-S-i\") 'isearch-backward)\n\nwhich works fine until I try to find the next match. The problem is that in Emacs this is carrried out by typing C-s again. Unfortunately I cannot bind the isearch-repeat-forward commands to C-i because that undoes the binding of C-i to isearch-forward. \nI perhps wouldnt mind something like C-r for repeat but annoyingly emacs has a different repeat command for forward and reverse incremental search\nDoes anyone know of a good fix to this?\n\nA: isearch-repeat-forward is bound to C-s on the Isearch mode. You may notice that when you press C-s you enter a new minor mode in your buffer. Since each mode has its own keybinding map, you should alter C-s binding on this map. The define-key function receives an argument which is the mode map you want to bind the key, in that case isearch-mode. Try put this on your init.el\n(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd \"C-i\") 'isearch-repeat-forward)\n(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd \"C-S-i\") 'isearch-repeat-backward)\n\n", "Q: Difference between apt-get remove -y and apt-get purge -y? apt-get remove <name of program>  \n\napt-get purge <name of program>\n\nand\napt-get purge -y <name of program>\n\nResearch indicates the running either \"remove\" or \"purge\" performs the exact same function and that they are interchangeable commands.\nRunning the command apt-get purge -y <name of program> removes the program and its dependencies.\nIOW, does this command remove dependencies strictly associated with that program or is it liable to delete shared dependencies that may cause other programs to stop working?\nWhich should I run to delete a program? purge or purge -y ?\n\nA: apt-get remove removes the package in question\napt-get purge is equivalent to apt-get remove --purge and will remove user data/configuration files.\nFrom man apt-get:\n\n   purge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\n\nand\n\n   --purge\n       Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be removed. An asterisk (\"*\") will be displayed next to packages which are scheduled to be purged.  remove --purge is equivalent to the purge command. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Purge.\n\n\nthe -y flag tells the command to proceed without confirmation for trivial questions. Again, from man apt-get:\n\n   -y, --yes, --assume-yes\n       Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\n\n\nA: The man page for apt-get has the following information -\n   remove\n       remove is identical to install except that packages are removed\n       instead of installed. Note that removing a package leaves its\n       configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to\n       the package name (with no intervening space), the identified\n       package will be installed instead of removed.\n\n   purge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and\n       purged (any configuration files are deleted too).\n\nTherefore, if you wish to delete all the configuration files of a particular package along with it, purge is the better option. However, if you wish to retain the configuration files, remove should be used.\n   -y, --yes, --assume-yes\n       Automatic yes to prompts; assume \"yes\" as answer to all prompts and\n       run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as\n       changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated\n       package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will\n       abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.\n\nThe -y flag does not remove dependencies but instead skips the user confirmation for the removal of the package, assuming it as a 'Yes' in the Y/N prompt.\nFor removing a package that is causing problems or need not be installed again, the best option is -\napt-get purge <packagename>\nThis is because if the configuration files for an application have been modified in a way that caused errors, purge will remove them, effectively making the subsequent install appear as a fresh install.\nNOTE : The purge option does not apply to packages that hold configuration files inside the user's home folder.

Will apache2 and mysql continue to run after the upgrade?\n\nA: In general it will work and if the upgrade process can do its thing it'll all work out. If there is a power outage though you will run into trouble...\nYou can plan for upgrade failure. As with ALL upgrades:\nI would assume you would dump your database and create a copy of my.cnf. That's all there if for MySQL. If it does not run after the upgrade it probably is a setting that needs tweaking. \nSame for Apache: I would assume you create a backup of your settings (/etc/apache2/) and your websites (might be /var/www/) and other settings.

As a side note, the fact that Ubuntu is recognizing it as a 20\", when it's actually a 15\", might be contributing to this issue.\nEdit:\nSo, after a bit more searching around on the internets, I found a guide that pointed me to look into the NVIDIA X Server Settings. \nWhile the guide didn't actually help me specifically, it did help me find a setting, Underscan, that I tweaked until the display was showing to top bar.

It might be an overscan problem.  There should be a 'just scan'  option on your TV. If not, it might be an overscanning problem with Ubuntu, which can be set in xorg config settings.

Did you install the right packages?\n\nA: Outside of the apparent fact that what you are attempting to install is classified as BETA SOFTWARE (never a good idea), I can't speak for what may be wrong with the failed installation you were trying to make, but I could make a suggestion or four to ensure success if all you want is a file manager that works in a nearly identical fashion.\nAs a old-timey classic DOS user who very much appreciated the release of Norton Commander in the late 1980's, I was thrilled to hear there were several nearly identical two-panel file managers for Linux.  You can find not less than FOUR of them in the UBUNTU SOFTWARE CENTER.  \nUntil reading your post today, I had only installed \"gnome commander\" which I had installed on this system as I had been using it the longest, but after looking at the features of another one called \"Midnight Commander\" I installed that one just now because it looks like it might even be better.  The other two file managers to be found in the software center are called \"Tux Commander\" and \"Krusader\". \nGenerally speaking, you can be assured of easy installation and fully certified functionality by sticking to the software available to you in the Ubuntu Software Center, although I will admit that sometimes I need to install something it doesn't offer, such as the proprietary software for my Withings smart scale or the aftermarket software to operate my brother label printer.  \nIs there a particular reason you are choosing to install a mere file manager it doesn't offer?  What is it about \"Double Commander\" you find so necessary?  I read about it and I don't understand the appeal outside of the unavoidable similarity of function to the Norton Commander.\nMostly I use the file manager included with Ubuntu because I teach Ubuntu and I prefer to be fluent in what my students are using.  I suspect I could make them all commander converts without much difficulty.\nAs I see you are a newbie on this site and as such may be unfamiliar with the GUI software center, I'll give you the quickstart to installing software using it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the windows key on your keyboard.  (if your keyboard does not have one, click the icon in the upper left corner which functions like a finder)\n\n*Type \"soft\" (sans quotes), followed immediately by pressing enter.\n\n*WAIT for the software center to fully load be fore pressing more keys\n\n*Type \"commander\" (sans quotes) but do not press anything after that.\n\n*Read through the first few hits, not all of which will be file managers, but most will.  Pay attention to star ratings.  Read the descriptions to discover which ones best suit your needs.  None will occupy much space on your drive so consider installing all of them and determining by means of use which one is most satisfying.\n\n\nA: I had same problem with double commander for GTK2 and I solved it when installed double commander for QT4) More information is here- https://sourceforge.net/p/doublecmd/wiki/Download/ \n", "Q: After installing xubuntu, I did not get a boot loader, help?

I have a test.txt file that I created in Windows and it shows up appropriately in my Ubuntu VM. Virtualbox mounts the shared folder in /media/sf_share (the name I gave to the shared folder in the virtualbox settings was share). I want to move the mount point from /media/sf_share to simply /srv so that on my windows host I can edit files and they show up under /srv. How can I accomplish this?\n**\nWhat I've tried:\n**\nI've edited /etc/fstab to look like this:\nshare /srv vboxsf defaults 0 0\n\nAfter doing this I used the command mount -a, also I rebooted, and I rebooted again with the virtualbox shared folder settings to NOT auto-mount.\nI read there is an issue with filesystems being mounted before virtualbox utilities are loaded, so I added vboxsf to my /etc/modules and then repeated the steps above.\nNone of them reproduce the correct content in /srv. When I issue mount -a AFTER I have edited the fstab I can sometimes get it to work. I don't know what I'm doing differently each time, but sometimes after I edit fstab, issue mount -a without rebooting I can see the files there. After a reboot though the files are gone again.\n\nA: You have to change the \"Guest properties\" to modify the mount prefix and base directory used for the shared folders.\nSee https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sf_mount_auto\nand https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-guestprops\nAn important note, though:\nBoth properties detailed in the first link have default values when not set or cleared:\n/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix defaults to sf_ if not set.\nSet /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir defaults to /media if not set\nAs a consequence, you have to set MountPrefix to / if you do not want the sf_ prefix, as trying to set it to \"\" will in fact clear the property and put it back to its default value.\n\nA: Check /etc/fstab? I'm not too sure how virtualbox shares, so if changing the mount point breaks the sharing, you could change it back & bind mount /media/sf_share to /srv\nInfo on bind mounting & fstab:\n\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/613179/how-do-i-do-mount-bind-in-etc-fstab\n\nIf I had a volume mounted at /media/3tb-vol1/Private/, and I wanted to bind it to /srv/Private I have a /etc/fstab like this.  \n/media/3tb-vol1/Private/ /srv/Private        none    bind\n\n\nOf course, I don't know the details of VirtualBox's sharing. I'm not sure how & when /media/sf_share gets mounted, if it's not ready when fstab is, it might not be mounted in time to be bound...?\n\nA: Based on Nawak's answer, I finally managed to get it done. I had already tried so many solutions (based on /etc/fstab/ and setting some /etc/rc.local) but this one was the one that worked.\nI just ran the following commands (from the host machine):\nVBoxManage guestproperty set \"Ubuntu 16\" /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountPrefix /\nVBoxManage guestproperty set \"Ubuntu 16\" /VirtualBox/GuestAdd/SharedFolders/MountDir srv\n\nWhere Ubuntu 16 is the name of my VM. In order to check that these properyies where applied properly, you can run:\nVBoxManage guestproperty enumerate \"Ubuntu 16\"\n\n", "Q: program opening multiple processes I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and am using KDE Dolphin as my file manager.  It works just fine.  I did however notice that it is now running in multiple processes.  It is as if every time I go to a new folder a new process opens.  This never happened before.  I have been using Dolphin this way since 11.04.  It always ran in a single process.  I searched and I can't seem to find out why it is suddenly doing this or how to get it to run in a single process again.  I tried the KDE user wiki to no avail.  I can't tell if the issue is a from Dolphin or Ubuntu.  There was no upgrade at the time aside from the usual Ubuntu updates that did not include Dolphin.  I do know Windows has a setting to change whether Windows Explorer opens in a single or multiple process.  Is there something like that in Ubuntu?\n\nA: I finally found the answer in a Kbuntu forum in the following thread:\n\"Konqueror and Dolphin are creating Zombies!\"\nDolphin was leaving zombie processes behind as I moved from folder to folder. (It took me a while to realize that they were called \"zombie processes\").\nI followed what stychokiller posted on May 25th 2014 and fixed the problem by deleting .kde/share/config/dolphinrc\nhttps://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?65569-Konqueror-and-Dolphin-are-creating-Zombies!&p=351866&viewfull=1#post351866\n\nUPDATE: Unfortunately the above solution only seems to work if I don't reconfigure Dolphin. With the default dolphinrc file I did not get any zombies. I then reconfigured Dolphin the way I wanted it and and it's leaving zombie processes in it's wake again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove gnome-contacts in 14.04?

Today, I powered on the machine and it was hanging at the loading screen with logo and cycling dots - I've waited at this screen for about an hour several times with no results. If I interrupt upstart with ctrl-alt-del, bootup resumes/completes, but it puts me at tty console login. X does start, a few seconds later, but a dialog about graphics being configured incorrectly is immediately brought up. Update: The X issue was resolved by doing apt-get install nvidia-current. Interrupt issue still stands.\nUnfortunately, every lead I've found as to why this might be happening has turned into a dead end. Here's my boot.log (from /var/log) showing where I interrupted the startup. You can see it hangs just as it starts \"enable remaining boot-time encrypted block devices\" (this is from cryptdisks), but removing that service makes no difference. I've tried pretty much everything from this Mint bug report, which describes symptoms nearly identical to mine, to no avail. At this point, I'm fairly sure that cryptdisks is a red herring, and that it's something else entirely.\nI've also found that resuming startup from recovery mode seems to load things in a different order. Upstart still hangs, but not after cryptdisks. If I ctrl-alt-del, it brings me to the graphical login manager instead of a tty, and I can login successfully. However, the system still isn't fully functional; USB plug and play seems not to work, I can't use my second monitor, and I have to manually do start resolvconf to access the internet. Here's the boot.log from one of those startups.\nI should add that I am encrypting my HDD with LUKS, and the hang happens after I successfully enter the decryption password. Here's my fstab, in case it has anything to do with things:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

It turns out that having that many files there causes the service which cleans /tmp to take a long, long time (duh). After moving the files out of /tmp, the problem is solved. It had nothing to do with the upgrade; that was just a coincidence.\n\nIn case it helps anyone later, here's the process I used to figure it out. I enabled the \"Magic SysRq key\" by changing etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf. Then, I reproduced the problem by rebooting; when startup hung, I hit Alt-SysRq-t. This dumped the following in the kernel buffer, read using dmesg:\n[   36.318527] SysRq : Show Blocked State\n[   36.318696]   task                        PC stack   pid father\n[   36.318719] find            D ffff88041dd93480     0   839    788 0x00000000\n[   36.318721]  ffff880405d07a48 0000000000000082 ffff880401136000 ffff880405d07fd8\n[   36.318723]  0000000000013480 0000000000013480 ffff880401136000 ffff88041dd93d18\n[   36.318725]  ffff88041dfab460 0000000000000002 ffffffff811ef380 ffff880405d07ac0\n\nIt dumps a lot more than this, but this is the relevant part. This shows the blocked task is find. After that, it was just a matter of a knowledgeable friend knowing that the /tmp cleaning service was a likely culprit.\n\nA: Thank-you, Chaosed0, for coming back with your solution (i.e. huge number of files in /tmp).  [I tried to post this as a comment but I don't have enough reputation points]\nI ran into the same issue with Ubuntu server (14.04) and it was very difficult to diagnose until I found your post.\nWhen I rebooted the machine, it would appear to get blocked right before it would normally show the login console.  It could be unblocked by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, which would cause a log message to be printed that wait-for-state (rcplymouth-shutdown) had been terminated.  That log message sent me down the wrong path of poking various plymouth scripts and then trying to disable plymouth completely :-(\nIn actual fact, the boot process wasn't deadlocked, it was just waiting for the clean-up of /tmp to complete.  That machine had tens of thousands of files under /tmp, so it was taking a long long long time to do the clean-up.\nSo the fix for me was to boot into recovery, get a root shell and then rm -rf /tmp/*.  After an hour or so the rm job completed.  Then I rebooted and everything worked normally.\nIt would be great if a log message could be printed when the clean-up of /tmp starts.\n", "Q: How do I change permissions of folders on a hard drive from a booted USB drive I am trying to save my files on my Hard Drive that has a crashed OS.

You can use the following command to log out of root:\nexit\n\n\nA: I think you only need the mount option uid=[youruserid]\nIn a terminal you can type echo $UID or id -u to find out your user id.\nIf the drive's fs is fat, ntfs, cd-rom, udf, and a few others uid=value will \"Set the owner and group of all files\" to whose id is specified.\nIf the partition's already mounted (mount to see it & what device it is, or blkid) you might be able to just use  \nsudo mount -o remount,uid=[youruserid] /dev/[device] [mountpoint] \nwhere [device] is the \"sda1\" or \"sdc2\" or whatever the right drive is, and [mountpoint] is the folder it's mounted to (with full path, often /media/something or similar.\n(read [device] and [mountpoint] from the above mount or blkid commands)\nUsing sudo mount -o remount,uid=[youruserid] /dev/[device]  alone might work, definitely works if there's an fstab entry for it.\n\nA: It probably has to do with how the drive is mounted. If the drive is not mounted with proper ownership, you wont be able to access it. unmount the drive with umount. Then mount it again with the proper permissions: Lets say your UID is 1000 and the drive is a FAT partition then your mount statement should look a bit like this\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdwhateveryourdriveis ~/mnt -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nThis options flag (-o) should set the proper permissions for the directories on your drive. use the dmask and fmask values above and you your UID for uid\n", "Q: Final Hardware Selection Step in Landscape Openstack Install I'm on the last step before my Landscape Openstack install should begin.

I want to install Windows 8 + Ubuntu 14.04 for daily use + Ubuntu Studio for audio production. The method I've followed is to install W8 in the clean disk, then shrink the Windows personal data partition and install the linux distributions on the space avaible. To install them I create a / and a /home partition for each distribution, but the EFI boot partition which is created by W8 at the begining of the disk is unique. I installed both bootloaders on it. Now Ubuntu Studio boots perfectly but Ubuntu 14.04 does not (even appears as Unknown linux distribution in the grub menu).\nIs there any problem with installing various linux bootloaders in the same boot partition (maybe because kernels get mixed or something)? Or my problem should be unrelated to this? If there is trouble with it, should I make a boot partition in sda7 or so for one of the bootloaders, or its crucial for the boot partition to reside at the beginning of the disk?

I have a Mightex camera and have been given the source code for the drivers by the company. They have been very helpful so far but was hoping to ask here and understand what's going on. This is the first time I have to manually install / compile drivers like this so please excuse my ignorance.\nIn the readme file it says I should do the following:\nmake\nmake install\n\nand that should be it.\nIt doesn't say I should but I run it as root (ie use sudo)\nWhen I run sudo make I get a bunch of warnings about variables not used etc (let me know if this is needed so I can post) Also, I then proceed to run sudo make install and get the following error:\n/sbin/depmod -aeE\n/sbin/depmod: option requires an argument -- 'E'\n\nmake: *** [install] Error 1\n\nThe man page of depmod says:\n\nWhen combined with the -e option, this reports any symbol versions supplied by modules that do not match with the symbol versions provided by the kernel in its Module.symvers.

I'm a bit at a loss here.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Generally, in order to compile a driver from source code, you need to install the prerequisites build-essential and linux-headers-generic. Then the usual procedure is:\ncd ~/directory/with/sourcecode  <--for example, ~/Downloads/mightex\nmake\n\nAnd if there are no errors:\nsudo make install\nsudo depmod -a\n\nWarnings are often acceptable; errors are not. \nIt would be helpful to see the result of this sequence.

For Ubuntu with English GUI language several English localizations are installed, like New Zealand, Ireland, Australia, Canada and so on. However only en_US is needed. How to achieve this goal? We doubt it was a mainstream who asks for english gui in its all variants.\n\nA: You can't get rid of them easily, since all the English variants are shipped in the same set of language packs in Ubuntu. My advice would be to select en_US and leave it at that. The other installed English variants do no harm, do they?\n\nA: You can install localepurge to purge all the useless locale info and translations that are not the same as the locale (en_US) used. To install this, open a terminal and execute the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install localepurge\n\nfollow the instructions.\nAlso, whenever you install new applications in the future, the foreign locale info (non en_US translations) will be deleted upon installation.\nEdit:\n<quote from \"man localepurge\">\nA Word of CAUTION\nPlease note, that this tool is a hack  which  is  not  integrated  with\nDebian's  package  management system and therefore is not meant for the\nfaint of heart.

You may want to ask a separate question for that problem to get the help you need.\nHowever, here are some of the basics:\nI will say that I'm not so sure $OWNER is correct and it very well may also do absolutely nothing as well but this time with no errors.\nYou can list all the files ownership and permissions in the current directory with the following command:\nls-l\n\nto list the files of a specific directory, you can specify it like so to show the ownership and permissions for public_html:\nls -l /var/www/domain.com\n\nTypically, all files and directories should be owned by root like so:\nsudo chown -R root:root /var/www\n\nIf you would like to change ownership to the current user instead of root, you can use this command which is similar to the command you were trying to run earlier:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain.com/public_html\n\nAll directories should be set with chmod to 755 (drwxr-xr-x).\nAll non-directory files (index.html for example) should be more restrictive and should be set using chmod to 644 (-rw-r--r--)\nYou could first go ahead and set 755 recursively to all files and directories under /var/www before then setting the individual files to 644 like this:\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www\n\nand this example of setting an individual file to 644\nsudo chmod 644 /var/www/domain.com/index.html\n\nand this example would set all files (assuming there are no more directories) contained in the directory public_html to 644.\nsudo chmod 644 /var/www/domain.com/public_html/*\n\nAgain, use ls -l to verify the permissions are set properly.\nexample command and  output for a directory with permission set to 755:\nls -l / | grep var\ndrwxr-xr-x   1 root  root       30 Nov  22 19:25 var\n\nexample command and output to list all files in a directory with proper permission set to 644:\nls -l /var/domain.com/public_html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   425 Dec  19 03:18 index.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   425 Dec  19 03:18 example.html\n\n", "Q: How to prevent deja-dup-monitor from running, or completely delete it? My ubuntu is dead after a few minutes because a process called deja-dup-monitor consumes almost 7 GB memory. I searched the internet and found that it seems to be used for backups and related to the \"Chrome Remote Desktop\". I don't remember installing this software and I don't want to backup something. So what commandline can I use to prevent deja-dup-monitor from running, or to completely delete it or Chrome Remote Desktop? Thanks a lot.\n\nA: Something about installing Chrome Remote Desktop causing this app to start misbehaving.  Uninstalling it as described above does the trick.\n\nA: There is an open bug at launchpad: deja-dup monitor was taking 6GB of memory.\n\nA: I fix this problem by myself. The deja-dup-monitor is a component of \"Deja Dup Backup Tool\". When search with keyword \"backup\", this software appears blatantly in the first place in the Software Center. After uninstalling it, everything will return to order. I then reinstalled this software just to leave a review warning people not to install it, if they don't want their ubuntu to die, and uninstall it immediately in a hurry.\nI am curious about the development team of this software. Does developers in this team all have a computer with 256GB memory so that no one found this problem? or they are so bold-faced to write a rubbish software to make them happy by seeing their users hit their heads against a wall. If I wrote such a code (yes I sometimes did because I'm not a genius), I will feel so ashamed that I will fix this memory leakage bug (or something) as soon as possible even after two or three sleepless nights. \n\nA: Remove chrome remote desktop mine was using 3Gb of RAM, after login CPU would be zero and IOwoit would shoot too 90% and freeze every time.\n\nA: If you have the mate desktop installed, there is another problem -\ndeja-dup is part of the desktop; and removing deja-dup removes Mate!\nSo, my approach is to use the mate system monitor and kill the process. Then, sudo rm /usr/bin/deja-dup.\nI like to use rsync and find a mandatory installation of deja-dup preposterous.\n\nA: If you want to retain deja-dup for manual backups, but don't want the monitor task running, simply switch off the monitor function by clicking the button in the upper right hand corner of the deja-dup control window.\n\nThis gets rid of automatic backups and the monitor task, but allows you to take and restore backups at will.\n", "Q: File recovery data copy This is my first time using Ubuntu, and I'm using it to recover data from the drives of my dead READYNAS.\nThe commands used to access/mount the RAID were obtained from here:\nhttp://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=74912\n(1) sudo su\n(2) apt-get install fuseext2\n(3) apt-get install lvm2\n(4) modprobe fuse\n(5) vgscan\n(6) vgchange -ay c\n(7) fuseext2 -o ro -o sync_read /dev/c/c /mnt\nI've been able to cp off much of the data, but have run into an access issue, I think.\nHere's my terminal window:\nroot@nusheen-P5Q-E:/mnt/media# dir -a\n.  ..

I want to completely uninstall Pycharm 3.4 and reinstall 4.x.x version. I installed it form .tar.gz file. Which directory is to be deleted for uninstalling pycharm without harming the current projects?\n\nA: You are right, there are only two things to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the pycharm-community-3.4.X folder (installation files) that you extracted from the .tar.gz\n\n*Delete the ~/.PyCharm30 folder (configuration files)\n\n\nYou can see here that PyCharm doesn't put any more files than that in your system.\n\nA: Open the terminal and use the below command which will open the pycharm from bin, \nsudo ./pycharm.sh\n\nOnce it gets opened, create a desktop entry with the help of 'Tools\". This will help to create a file in desktop. After file created in desktop right click and delete the pycharm file. This will help you to delete pycharm without giving any effect to the current projects. \n\nA: Not applicable to your case, but in the future, you may want to install PyCharm via the JetBrains Toolbox.

I do not want to make partitions on my machine because as it is an official laptop.\n\nA: It should be possible to boot the external drive automatically only when the external drive is connected. Just install windows to the external drive and set the external drive or USB (if it connects via USB port) as the first bootloader device in the BIOS settings. When the drive is not connected, the next bootloader device  (internal drive) will automatically boot.\n\nAlternatively, (assuming windows is already installed on the external drive), run the following command to create a grub menu entry for windows you can select at boot:\nsudo update-grub\n\nWindows should be detected if the drive is recognized at the time of the update. It does not matter if the drive is mounted or not but if it is not recognized, you may need to mount it first.\n\nWill doing this mean that when i plugin my external drive to my machine, I would be getting option either to load linux or windows? \n\nYes, connect the drive before you power on the computer and make sure the internal hard disk is set as the first bootloader device in your BIOS settings and not USB or the external drive. You will have the option to boot Ubuntu or Windows, however, you should also have the option even when the drive is not connected.\n", "Q: How to install libjawt.so in ubuntu 14.10 I am trying to use webex in Ubuntu 14.10.\nI followed another question on this topic.

Notify OSD, native HUD and other generic Ubuntu-specific frameworks are promised to be fully exploited with these integrations, but in practice, it seems just talk and no action.\nFor example, when I search Facebook in Dash, and click on the webapp Facebook Messenger, it just kicks the browser and opens a new window with facebook.com (even if another window is already open).\nAll that seems to be working is some FM website that is of no use for me.\nI want to know what are benefits of these webapps integration and how do I use the webapps I've installed (let's say the Facebook one).\n\nA: Other than just creating shortcut in launcher you won't get any feature that you would not get in regular browser.\nI did once, the native browser does not give you many features like bookmark, add-ons etc. It will just create a shortcut in dash that you can search and just launch without typing URL\n", "Q: The following packages have unmet dependencies!

Meaning if you are alien (for whatever reason, a new project or what ever) to the fileset you are working on it becomes extremely time consuming as you have to head somewhat blindly into different folders... but if you are generally a busy person with far too much work to do the very last thing i want to do is waste any time on what should be the simplest IT task... navigating a file system.\nIs there any way I can achieve a windows explorer style file navigation?\nNB \nI am not looking to replicate anything else of windows file explorer. \n\nA: I'd recommend Thunar.\n\nYou can get the tree view in the side panel by just setting this mode in View -> Side Pane -> Tree: \n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure Nautilus can show a folder tree in it's side pane, it's switchable between the \"Places\" or a tree (maybe other options too). https://askubuntu.com/a/339138 [May even be a duplicate Q]\nAs can Thunar (XFCE file manager)\n", "Q: Disabling sudo su in Ubuntu 14.04 I need to accomplish the following things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Ubuntu user.\n\n*Disable sudo su for all users.\n\n*Each user should able to execute sudo <command>.\nI have modified my sudoer file as below:\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        mail_badpass\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\nCmnd_Alias   NSHELLS = /bin/sh,/bin/bash\nCmnd_Alias   NSU = /bin/su\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n\n**%sysadmins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL ,!NSHELLS, !NSU**\n\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\nStill, I can access sudo using the command:sudo sudo su\nHow to disable this?

It was a case where an installation step was failing, similar to the problem described in \"Error installing Ubuntu 14.04...\" for the Server version, or the problem described in \"errno 5 - input/output error...\" for the desktop version after successfully booting it from a USB stick (which was a drama in itself, since this often resulted in the problem described in \"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS live USB boot error...\")!\nThis, however, was not the end of my problems.  More often than not, web browsers like Firefox and Opera would crash for no apparent reason, while Chrome would simply Snap!  Also, Ubuntu updates were a nightmare since this, more often than not, would resulted in some internal error which, when reported, would open up the default web browser with the ticket number of a bug that had been previously reported.  While I was able to resolve the internal errors by cleaning and re-installing the apparently faulty Debian files, the checksums of other apparently faulty files that I had downloaded were different from what was reported on their respective web sites.\nI discovered that the cause of all my problems was due to a faulty DDR2 2GB memory card, which I determined by running MemTest86+, according to the feedback given in response to the problem description, \"Try to install Ubuntu - MD5 checksums different\".  Since removing the faulty memory card, I discovered that the correct checksums are now being reported for those files that I had previously downloaded.\nBecause I have downloaded many files since I installed Ubuntu, and because I do not want to go through the trouble of re-installing Ubuntu from scratch, my question is if there is a way of determining whether or not Ubuntu was installed correctly?  And, although the journaling features of ext3 and ext4 circumvents file corruption, is there a way of determining the integrity of the file system?\n\nQuestion Revised by Author - 24th Dec 2014\nAfter following the advice given by @psusi, I installed and ran debsums on my Ubuntu installation.  I received the following output.\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ sudo debsums -a -s\n[sudo] password for vasilios: \ndebsums: missing file /etc/default/chromium-browser (from chromium-browser package)\ndebsums: changed file /usr/lib/firefox/browser/omni.ja (from firefox package)\ndebsums: changed file /usr/lib/firefox/libxul.so (from firefox package)\ndebsums: changed file /usr/lib/firefox/omni.ja (from firefox package)\ndebsums: changed file /usr/share/locale-langpack/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/gtk30-properties.mo (from language-pack-gnome-zh-hans-base package)\ndebsums: changed file /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/gb24st.pcf.gz (from xfonts-base package)\n\nNot being certain whether or not these changes were due to updates, I also ran the following dpkg commands on the affected packages.\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ dpkg-query -W -f='${Status} ${Version}\\n' chromium-browser\ninstall ok installed 39.0.2171.65-0ubuntu0.14.10.1.1106\n\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ dpkg-query -W -f='${Status} ${Version}\\n' firefox\ninstall ok installed 34.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.10.2\n\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ dpkg-query -W -f='${Status} ${Version}\\n' language-pack-gnome-zh-hans-base\ninstall ok installed 1:14.10+20141205\n\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ dpkg-query -W -f='${Status} ${Version}\\n' xfonts-base\ninstall ok installed 1:1.0.3\nvasilios@OptiPlex-210L:~$ \n\nJudging by the output, it would appear that the packages have been installed correctly.  Is there any reason to believe otherwise?  Any advice/feedback would be appreciated.\n\nA: To check the filesystem itself, you fsck it.  This requires it to be unmounted, so you either need to boot from the live cd, or you can run sudo touch /forcefsck and reboot and it will be checked at boot time.\nTo check the integrity of installed applications/files, you can install the debsums package and run it and it will verify the md5sums of all files installed from packages.  Any packages with corrupt files you can sudo apt-get install --reinstall them.\n", "Q: High CPU usage in the processes related to postgres in ubuntu 12.04 My Ubuntu server 12.04 hangs quite oftenly (say once in a day), after hard reboot it starts running normally.\nThe server is Intel Xeon having 2 CPUs with 8GB RAM.There is high CPU usage in the processes related to postgres in ubuntu 12.04 (80%, 90% and sometimes more than 100%).\n\nA: This post saved my hours.\ncheck for the query running for the longest time and check if the query is stuck and running since more an hour.

Here's the content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=CM Terminal\nIcon=utilities-terminal\nType=Application\nCategories=Developoment\nExec=gnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/name/android/system\nTerminal=false\nStartupWMClass=gnome-terminal\n\nThis works but now I have two terminal icons in the taskbar on the side. Can I make Unity join these two entries?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Absolutely, but you don't need to create an additional launcher (.desktopfile) to do that. You can add the command: gnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/name/android/system to your existing gnome-terminallauncher as a quicklist item, available on right-click.\n\nHow to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your global .desktop file to the local directory ~/.local/share/applications:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop\n\n[An application's desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications \"overrules\" the global one. Unless you want the change to be available to all users, it is good practice to edit a local copy instead of the global one.]\n\n*Open the file with gedit:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop\n\n\n*Replace the line, starting with: Actions=, by:\nActions=New;CM Terminal;\n\n\n*Add a section at the end of the file:\n[Desktop Action CM Terminal]\nName=CM Terminal\nExec=gnome-terminal --working-directory=/home/name/android/system\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nLog out and back in and you your entry should be available on right-click\nNote:\nLooking at your .desktop file, by adding the line StartupWMClass=gnome-terminal, the launcher you created would \"steel\" the gnome-terminal windows from their original icon in the launcher. New terminal windows would appear under your (second) icon.\n", "Q: Crashplan on headless ubuntu server to back to cloud? I have a home server that acts as a backup server for all the computers in the house. It is running on headless ubuntu server 14.04.1 lts.\nI want a viable online offsite backup solution for the contents of the server and am wondering if it would be possible to install crashplan on the server and configure it to backup the server contents to the cloud?\nSo far the instructions I have found, allow you set up your ubuntu server as the endpoint for other crashplan clients in the house.\n\nA: Depending on what plan you choose from Crashplan, you can backup everything else in the house to the Ubuntu server and then the entire Ubuntu server to the cloud in Crashplan, or you can back up multiple machines to each other in the house and to the cloud as well (also using Crashplan)\nI got the Family plan which supports up to 10 computers so I do the latter.  I like that because I have local backups to take care of hardware failure scenarios, and cloud-based to take care of fire & theft scenarios.\nNote: if you put only the one machine on Crashplan, I would backup everything else using a different method, maybe rsync or robocopy.  Crashplan won't back up Crashplan backups, for obvious reasons.\n", "Q: How to install Klok 2 time management software on Adobe AIR with Ubuntu How to do this using Adobe AIR running on Wine.\n\nA: Got Klok working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nI used the free WineHQ software which enables many Windows applications to run on Ubuntu.\nSteps:\n1) Installing WINE, part 1 of 2: I ensured a pre-requisite package was installed\nhttps://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu\n2) Installing WINE, part 2 of 2: I then installed WineHQ from the commandline, issued command:\nsudo apt-get build-dep wine1.6\n3) Installing Adobe AIR - part 1 of 2: I downloaded Adobe Air from here\nhttp://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html\n4) Installing Adobe AIR - part 2 of 2: I right clicked on the downloaded air16_win.exe file, from: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html\nFrom the pop-up menu, I selected Open With, then selected Wine Windows Program Manager and followed the steps from there.\n5) Then I downloaded Klok from the 'Download Now' link on http://getklok.com/features.html#versions\n6) I right clicked on the download Klok2.air file and from the pop up menu, selected Open With Adobe AIR application installer.

Also i want to know that do i need to do anything else beside installing these 2 drivers for making them working?\n\nA: The Intel graphics driver is built-in in Ubuntu, so you don't need to install an additional driver for the Intel graphics. It is also OK to have the proprietary AMD graphics driver and the built-in Intel graphics driver installed at the same time. \nWhatever you did to install an unnecessary additional Intel graphics driver is what caused your low-graphics mode error message. To fix the problem, uninstall the unnecessary additional Intel graphics driver. If you can't remember the name of the graphics driver to uninstall it, you can find it by checking in the History tab in the Ubuntu Software Center, and if you installed it from the terminal you can find it by checking your terminal history using the history command.\n", "Q: Why does my grep -E command not work with a regex pattern containing a lookbehind? I have a regex which works fine for me. I checked it on following site: https://www.regex101.com/\n(?<=.log:)[^;]*\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work when I try to use it with grep. I tried to do the following thing:\ncat foo.log | grep -E '(?<=.log:)[^;]*'\n\nI know that there are matches because I created and tested my regex after this pattern.

I am trying to install any GnuPG GUI for easy encryption/decryption of text, and I feel like I am in bizarro world where nothing works at all. On Mac OS X, I use GPGTools and it works flawlessly, so I thought it will be similar on Ubuntu, but no such luck so far.\nWhat I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPA - it just starts, shows no less than 3 error messages on top of each other, and does nothing (doesn't even displays the keys I imported into gpg through bash).\n\n*KGPG - install tons of KDE packages through apt-get, and then it never starts anyway. I managed to get it to start once, but never again.\n\n*Seahorse - finally something that actually starts and shows my keys, but I can't find a way to do anything with them (encrypt or decrypt). Nothing shows up in any Nautilus menu. I have installed gedit-plugins, but nothing like GPG or Seahorse plugin shows up in gedit plugin list.\n\n\nWhat are my other options? \n(Note: I specifically don't want to use a mail client with GPG supoprt, I just want to encrypt and decrypt text files.)\n\nA: Besides Seahorse, which is only the key manager, you need a package called seahorse-nautilus to be able to encrypt/decrypt files with Nautilus.\nIt adds a menu item to the right-click context menu that allows you to encrypt a file directly from the file manager.\nNote: This is the package name in Ubuntu 14.04. Other versions may have a different package name.\nAdditional Note: It may be required to log out of the current session and re-login for everything to work properly after installing the required packages.\n\nA: I got KGpg to to work. \nDownloaded it from Ubuntu Software Center\nI found in the reviews section a tweak to make it work, follow instructions here: \nhttp://do-the-right-things.blogspot.com/2012/12/cavaet-in-using-kgpg-in-ubuntu.html\n\nA: I use Seahorse in combination with plugins for gedit and Nautilus. The easiest way to import keys I've found is to save the public key in a text file with the extension .asc and then double-click on it.\nFor Nautilus on ubuntu the package is called seahorse-nautilus, this adds an encrypt option when you right-click on a file in the file manager.\nFor gedit you install the plugin available on this site: https://pietrobattiston.it/gedit-crypto\nThis adds encrypt and decrypt options to the menu in gedit.\n", "Q: Choosing OS grub screen not displaying I installed Windows 7 after Ubuntu 14.04.

If it can, double-check the \"General Settings\" page.  In the \"Advanced Settings\" check the values of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT, GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET and GRUB_TIMEOUT.\nIf GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT is greater than zero, then GRUB is waiting (that many seconds) for a keypress to show the boot menu.

I have used the method linked here to replace Unity with Xubuntu/Xfce and all went perfectly.\nThe only problem is the way the indicator plugin looks in the Xfce panel.\nIt is this version:\n\nBut it has some features from Unity, like the Menus from certain applications (VLC, Firefox etc) are displayed within the panel indicator and are not present in the application's window; also, the items from the indicator are in a bit chaotic order, also some tray icons are present in the \"indicator\" plugin, while others are in the other panel plugin \"notification area\".\n\nAfter un-installing and then re-installing xfce4-indicator-plugin is also crushing  very often now.\n\nA: Following indications from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on Xfce panel and navigate to “Panel -> Panel Preferences …. Under Items tab,  put “Indicator Plugin” right after the “Notification Area” plugin to improve consistency.\n\n*Tick the box after “Application Menus (Global Menu)” to hide the menus of VLC, Firefox etc (and let them appear normally in their application's window). Hiding session management might be also a good idea.\n\n*To change the order of the indicator plugin items, use the up-down arrows\n\n\nBefore or instead of that one may consider reseting the Xfce panel as indicated in a comment to the question -  the indicated link is this.\n", "Q: ThinkPad W530 - Mini display port doesn't work I have a ThinkPad W530 Laptop.

I have two monitors, and while the mouse and keyboard both work perfectly fine, I cant move the mouse cursor off of the monitor screen its on when this freeze begins. Clicking on anything does nothing (at least, not for a long time), and I can do things like hit \"Ctrl Alt Del\" to bring the logout modal up. Clicking on icons in the unity launcher does nothing for this lockup time, and then after a large amount of time passes, all of the applications I clicked on suddenly open and everything runs as normal. \nThis isnt normal lag, as in the system performing slow or sluggish. Its just the unity desktop becomes unresponsive for minutes at a time exactly when I minimize the last application that isnt minimized. As long as I dont minimize windows, everything seems to run fine. Immediately after booting up, its also running fine. As soon as I open a single application and then minimize the window, the lockup/freeze begins. \nIm on 14.04, and have been for a few months now, and just started experiencing this issue in the last week or so. The machine its on has a 500GB SSD drive, quad core 3.2ghz, 16GB ram, and a decent nVidia display card with recent proprietary drivers. I am away from that machine currently, and can post full specs later. I am taking a wild guess that this is related to a recent update, and some conflict between the unity desktop and nvidia display drivers.\nAnyone else experiencing this, and know how to resolve?\n\nA: Its a bug that occurs with desktop icon viewability set to off (can be enabled/disabled with a tool like ubuntu tweak). After a recent system update, if you change this setting to hide desktop icons from view in the desktop, you might get this lockup-on-minimize behavior.\nCase closed, Ill report this on launchpad. \n", "Q: How to open .doc file using king office writer as default?

AFAIK I was able to install Adobe's standalone Flash Player under Precise. However, Trusty won 't let me install version 10 (I think that it is 32 bit?) of it without installing ia32-libs package. Since that package no longer exists on Trusty, what do I do?  \n\nA: The Standalone Flash Player for Windows can be used with Wine without issue, and actually is more efficient for Flash applications.  Unfortunately, VLC does not provide the intractability with interactive SWF files.\nI have written a test result for this on the AppDB for Wine, here.  Note that this is on a Trusty system with the Wine PPA.\nSimply download the Windows executable (link on the AppDB), and run it to run your .SWF applications.  It should work out of the box with Wine with no additional configuration or DLLs needed.\n\nA: Use vlc, open & play it.\nThe basics guide: http://www.ehow.com/how_7370013_open-swf-vlc.html\nThis is about replacing the flash player with vlc in your browser, so vlc should work stand-alone VLC for flash video\n", "Q: Problem with dpkg -p I'm trying to have informations about kernels installed with dpkg -s but the return is weird (and in french), but not seems to work:\n$ dpkg -p linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic\ndpkg-query: le paquet « linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic » n'est pas disponible\nUtilisez dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) pour examiner les fichiers\narchives, et dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) pour afficher leur\ncontenu.\n\nIt says that the package is missing (not available)... :(\nHowever, no problem with the option -s:\n$ dpkg -s linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic\nPackage: linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic\nStatus: install ok installed\nPriority: optional\nSection: kernel\nInstalled-Size: 44140\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Kernel Team <kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com>\nArchitecture: amd64\nSource: linux\nVersion: 3.16.0-28.38\nProvides: fuse-module, ivtv-modules, kvm-api-4, linux-image, linux-image-3.0, redhat-cluster-modules\nDepends: initramfs-tools (>= 0.36ubuntu6), module-init-tools (>= 3.3-pre11-4ubuntu3)\nPre-Depends: dpkg (>= 1.10.24)\nRecommends: grub-pc | grub-efi-amd64 | grub-efi-ia32 | grub | lilo (>= 19.1)\nSuggests: fdutils, linux-doc-3.16.0 | linux-source-3.16.0, linux-tools, linux-headers-3.16.0-28-generic\nConflicts: hotplug (<< 0.0.20040105-1)\nDescription: Linux kernel image for version 3.16.0 on 64 bit x86 SMP\n This package contains the Linux kernel image for version 3.16.0 on\n 64 bit x86 SMP.\n .\n Also includes the corresponding System.map file, the modules built by the\n packager, and scripts that try to ensure that the system is not left in an\n unbootable state after an update.\n .\n Supports Generic processors.\n .\n Geared toward desktop and server systems.\n .\n You likely do not want to install this package directly.

That's why -s works. It would be assumed, however, that linux-generic should be present in /var/lib/dpkg/available and not linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic, which would be why -d doesn't seem to work.\n", "Q: Eclipse Luna update to 4.4.1 fails in Ubuntu 14 (32-bit) With Luna running, I select the Help:Check for Updates option and am shown a list of updates, which are all checked except the one for Luna 4.4.1. \nI hit \"Select All\" and try to update.

But when I log in with user1 I realize than XFCE desktop configuration has not changed, I mean, it has not been updated with template configuration. I particular, I note than any changes on desktop configuration are ignored.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: In some cases (maybe even always) after quitting xfce4 session xfconfd daemon is still running. You need to log in under user1 to plain terminal session and pkill xfconfd. Then if you'll start xfce4 session you'll see that new xfce4 settings are applied.\n\nA: I got the error, it was so obvious but I didn't see it.\nWhen I run\nsudo cp -r --preserve /home/template/.config /home/user1/.config\n\nthe effect is that it creates a new directory .config inside /home/user1/.config.\nThe right script would be:\nsudo cp -r --preserve /home/template/.config /home/user1/\n\n\nA: To be thorough, when you login as \"template\" everything looks good?

was a file named ubuntu (I don't remember the extension) missing. \n\nA: Definitely a no-go using WUBI on Windows 8, don't try that (http://pad.lv/694242).\nSee this answer for more info than you could ever possibly want about installing on Windows 8, it's a little tricky because of gpt, UEFI, secure boot, may have to install 64-bit Ubuntu also... about 10 pages, mostly getting prepared to install, must-read:\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n", "Q: EFI boot Ubuntu 14.04 on a Mac without rEFInd I wish to completely remove OS X from my Mac and single install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nAlthough I wish to use the newer EFI boot method instead of the legacy BIOS boot, I do not want to use rEFInd or any other third party bootloader but instead, I want to use the Mac's default bootloader.\nThe reason for this is that I want to eliminate the approximately 30 second delay caused by other known methods and also wish to get access to various EFI related utilities.\nCan you provide a detailed and step by step method in order to achieve this?\n\nA: This process will wipe OS X and any other data you have on the machine. Please make sure to backup your system before proceeding.\nYou may wish to create a recovery disk so that you may restore OSX at a later date, if required.\nCreate a Live USB with Ubuntu\nRefer to this page for detailed instructions. UNetbootin is recommended since it is cross plaform and provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nNOTE - Do NOT use the +mac version since it does not support EFI boot.\nBoot from the Live USB\nThe trick to booting from USB on Macs is to hold down the option key as soon as you power on the device. Select EFI Boot from this menu.\n\nUbuntu should now boot up from the USB. Install Ubuntu using the Erase and use Entire Disk option.\n\nFirstly, when you reboot/power on your Mac, you will see the grey screen of the Mac bootloader for about 30s, and then a gently flashing folder with a '?' inside. If you insert the installer USB now, it should boot. If not, try holding the power button to force the power off, and then follow the USB booting instructions to bring it up.\nBoot Manually from Your Hard Drive\nAt this point the system is unbootable because the Mac bootloader expects the EFI partition to be formatted as HFS+, the typical Mac filesystem, while the Ubuntu installer actually formats it as VFAT.\nIn this step we'll instruct GRUB on the Live USB too boot off of your newly installed Ubuntu on the hard drive. – This will requires some serious typing, but after having booted this way we'll be ready to set up automatic boot in the next step.\nIf you’re using the desktop installer, hold the shift key to bring up the GRUB bootloader menu.\nWhen you see the GRUB boot menu, don't select any of the entries. Instead, press C to bring up the GRUB console. \nAt the grub console, type ls\ngrub> ls \n(memdisk) (hd0) (hd0,msdos) (hd1) (hd2) (hd2,gpt3) (hd2,gpt2)\n(hd2,gpt1)\n\nYou may not get exactly the same results as this, but you’ll have some similar options. \nNow, find the partition which contains your user's home directory.\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/home\nrohith/\n\nKeep trying until you find it.\nThe result from the last step has two parts: (hdX,gptY). You need to keep the hdX part, but go through all the gptY options looking for a /boot/grub directory.\ngrub> ls (hd2,gpt2)/boot/grub\nunicode.pf2 [...] grub.cfg\n\nNow you want to set this as your root for further commands.\ngrub> set root=(hd2,gpt2)\n\nThe only way to boot properly is to use the UUID of the drive.\ngrub> ls -l (hd2,gpt2)\n\nNote down the UUID. You'll have to type it manually in the next step.\ngrub> linux /boot/vmlinuz〈Tab here!〉.efi.signed root=UUID=〈the UUID from above〉\n\nThe GRUB console can do tab completion, so if you just type out the vmlinuz part and hit tab, then hit . and tab again, you won't have to type the whole file name. make sure that the efi.signed part is present.\nNow, set the initial RAM disk\ngrub> initrd /boot/initrd〈Tab here!〉\n\nYou should be able to boot off your hard drive the command\ngrub> boot\n\n\nSetting up Automatic Boot\nYou have now booted into your newly installed Ubuntu. Next step is to make boot automatic and pain free, by reformatting the /boot/efi partition to the HFS+ file system that Mac expects, and allowing you to boot straight off of it.\n1. Installing Extra Packages\nNow, open a terminal and type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:detly/mactel-utils\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mactel-boot hfsprogs gdisk grub-efi-amd64\n\n2. Reformatting the EFI Partition\nRun mount to get a list of mounted filesystems, and look for anything mounted at /boot/efi. Unmount it.\nsudo umount /dev/sda1\n\nWe now use gdisk to delete the VFAT partition and create an HFS+ one\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\n\n(Note that there is NO number at the end of that disk name!)\nPress p\nConfirm that the first partition has type EF00. Now we delete that EF00 partition.\nPress d\nCreate a new HFS+ one in its place.\nPress n\nPress enter for the first and last sector options.\nEnter AF00 for the filesystem code.\nUse the p command to double-check your changes, and then w to write.\nNow we have an unformatted HFS+ partition. Format it with:\nsudo mkfs.hfsplus /dev/sda1 -v ubuntu\n\n3. Updating the Filesystem Table\nEdit /etc/fstab\nsudoedit /etc/fstab\n\nDelete the lines that refer to /boot/efi using Ctrl+K.\nNow, type the following commands - \nsudo bash -c 'echo $(blkid -o export -s UUID /dev/sda1) /boot/efi auto defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab'\nmount /boot/efi\n\n4. Installing GRUB on the HFS Partition\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"This file is required for booting\" > /boot/efi/mach_kernel'\n\nInstall GRUB and 'bless' the filesystem.\nsudo grub-install --target x86_64-efi --boot-directory=/boot --efi-directory=/boot/efi\nsudo hfs-bless \"/boot/efi/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\"\n\nEDIT Some Troubleshooting: When following these instructions on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, I got the following error message from grub-install\nInstalling for x86_64-efi platform.grub-install\nerror: Can't create file: No such file or directory.\n\nAfter running it again with strace I determined that it wasn't looking for a file called /boot/efi/mach_kernel, but a file called /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/mach_kernel and after creating that file, and re-running grub-install everything seems to work. END EDIT\n5. Removing the Boot Delay\nTo set the default EFI boot entry, run\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nGet rid of the extra entries - \nsudo efibootmgr -b xxxx -B\n\nwhere xxxx is the boot number obtained from sudo efibootmgr\nNow, set the default entry -\nsudo efibootmgr -o xxxx\n\nThe system should now be bootable!\nCREDITS\nJason Heeris - For his original post, the PPA used.\nRohith Madhavan - For the post on Ask Ubuntu, minor modifications.\n", "Q: How can I tell if a CVE has been fixed in Ubuntu's repositories? Today a couple of buffer overflows in NTP were announced 1, 2. It looks like updating my system to fix these issues is in order. \nHow can I find out if they have been fixed in the Ubuntu repositories, such that if I were to run: \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthen the fix would get installed and the vulnerability closed? \nEdit: The selected answer specifically addresses the question of how to identify if a given CVE has been fixed or not, \"Does Ubuntu generally post timely security updates?\" 3 is certainly related but not identical\n\nA: What you're looking for are Ubuntu Security Notifications and they are not clearly listed in the repositories.  This page is the main Ubuntu Security Notifications listing.\nAs for individual packages, updates which address security fixes are in their own special repository, the -security pocket.  Using Synaptic, you can switch to the \"Origin\" view, and see packages in the RELEASE-security pocket.\nAll CVEs are also listed in the Ubuntu Security Team's CVE tracker - with your specifically referenced CVE here.  In the case of CVE-2014-9295 which you reference here, it has not yet been fixed.\nOnce an update is available, it will be detected by sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade once it's released in the security repository.\n\nA: While the accepted answer is correct, I often find I am able to find out this info by viewing the changelog of a package, and that is easier than scouring the CVE trackers or security notifications listing.  For example:\nsudo apt-get update\napt-get changelog ntp\n\nThe output of the above command includes:\n...\nntp (1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu3) vivid; urgency=medium\n\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: weak default key in config_auth()\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2014-9293.patch: use openssl for random key in\n      ntpd/ntp_config.c, ntpd/ntpd.c.\n    - CVE-2014-9293\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: non-cryptographic random number generator with weak\n    seed used by ntp-keygen to generate symmetric keys\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2014-9294.patch: use openssl for random key in\n      include/ntp_random.h, libntp/ntp_random.c, util/ntp-keygen.c.\n    - CVE-2014-9294\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: buffer overflows in crypto_recv(), ctl_putdata(), configure()\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2014-9295.patch: check lengths in\n      ntpd/ntp_control.c, ntpd/ntp_crypto.c.\n    - CVE-2014-9295\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: missing return on error in receive()\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2015-9296.patch: add missing return in\n      ntpd/ntp_proto.c.\n    - CVE-2014-9296\n\n -- Marc Deslauriers <marc.deslauriers@ubuntu.com>  Sat, 20 Dec 2014 05:47:10 -0500\n...\n\nWhich clearly shows that the bugs you mentioned have been fixed in the ubuntu repositories.  You can then run:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nto pull down the fix.\n\nA: I think you're talking about checking a package's changelog? To see what's new, major big fixes, etc? Synaptic has an easy way to try & download changelogs.\nOr if the changelog isn't available or is too brief, the best way might be to note the available version, and go to the developer website & see hopefully more detailed changes.\n\nA: If you run those commands, you'll get any fixes that are in the repositories -- but those might not be, yet.  If you have Update Notifier enabled (a tray widget), you'll get a notification whenever there are system or security updates (and security updates will be noted as such).  Then you'll get the patches as soon as they're out for Ubuntu, without having to stress over them.\n", "Q: Good presentation software with smooth slide transition I have tested the libre office impress and the openoffice presentation software and they are very good and do pretty much what I want but both of them have an issue with slide transition and animation, it's not very smooth enough , so is there anything i can add to them to make it much smoother , or is there any application out there that have a really smooth slideshow transition ?\n\nA: It's not an application, but you can always look at prezi. It's online and if I remember correctly there is an iOS app. Used that for many presentations and the professors or people in the meeting loved it.\nhttps://prezi.com/ \n\nA: You could try Calligra Suite:\nhttps://www.calligra.org\nThe application is called 'Stage'.\n", "Q: How to create a swapfile? I have a 500Gib hard disk and 2Gib of RAM. I have ubuntu 12.04\nWhen I originally particioned the disk, I had unallocated space because I had another disk with Windows in it. This disk died, so I had to install Windows in this disk and had to erase Swap Partition.\nNow, as I work with lot of pictures, videos and so on, computer is turning slow and I think it is because I haven't swapfile.\nA friend of mine gave me the command below, but the count number give me 2Gib of swapfile and I want to have 4 Gib of swapfile.\nPlease can you tell me which number to put in count?\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile.swap bs=4096 count=1048576\n\n\nA: To create 4GB of swapfile, you can run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1K count=4M\n\nso by using multiplicative suffixes it's easier to count (1K * 4M = 4 GiB).\nThen you need to convert that file into swap space, and enable it, so:\nsudo mkswap swapfile\nsudo swapon swapfile\n\nFor more details, check: How do I add a swap?\n\nA: The basic steps of how to create a swap file are described in Arch Wiki article on swap.

E.g. I am using gnome \"fallback\" session and clicked MC icon. the tree is: init - lightdm - lightdm - init - gnome-session - gnome-panel - gnome-terminal - mc. \nStarting it from menu gives gnome-panel to be a parent process that has started your launcher.\n\nA: The desktop file is based on a freedesktop.org standard which environments like Unity, Gnome, Xfce, and KDE follow. The desktop environment will interpret the file and run the program based on the file's contents.\n\nA: Check out this guide on launchers and desktop files. \n\nUnity Launchers are actually files stored in your computer, with a '.desktop' extension. In earlier Ubuntu versions, these files were simply used so as to launch a specific application, but in Unity they are also used so as to create right-click menus for each application, which you can access from the Unity Launcher.\n\nThe lines in the file are basically instructions for your desktop environment on what to do with the application/launcher when clicked on or launched from that .desktop file.

So I removed it and tried apt-get install gfortran-4.8. The problem is that now it can be run with gfortran-4.8 (obviously) instead of gfortran which is expected by the other software.\nCan I make it run with gfortran command?\nedit:\nI read about aliases and tried setting up ~/.bash_aliases containing\nalias gfortran='gfortran-4.8'\n\nbut with no effect.\n\nA: What you can do is create a symbolic link (or a \"shortcut\") for gfortran-4.8 and name the shortcut gfortran.\nFirst, find out where gfortran-4.8 is actually located. You do that by running the command which gfortran-4.8. Let's say you get an output like this:\n/usr/bin/gfortran-4.8\n\nWhat you would do is execute the following command to create the shortcut:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gfortran-4.8 /usr/bin/gfortran\n\nNow you (and other programs that were looking for it) should be able to run the program using gfortran.\n\nA: I assume you're using something later than Trusty. This isn't a problem in Trusty as gfortran is still at 4.8.\nAssuming a downgrade isn't a real solution, I'll just show you how Trusty has things laid out. You might want to check it's similar in whatever you're running to make sure my conclusions are sound:\n$ dpkg -S $(which gfortran) $(which gfortran-4.8)\ngfortran: /usr/bin/gfortran\ngfortran-4.8: /usr/bin/gfortran-4.8\n\n$ file /usr/bin/gfortran\n/usr/bin/gfortran: symbolic link to `gfortran-4.8'\n\nSo basically here, the gfortran command is just redirecting to /usr/bin/gfortran-4.8. I expect in your version it's redirecting to /usr/bin/gfortran-4.9.\nWe can override packaged path binaries without touching them. I suggest (and this may undermine things that use gfortran so be careful) we create a new symlink in /usr/local/bin (note the local). When you call gfortran, the system will find the /usr/local/bin/gfortran version first. Note that anything calling /usr/bin/gfortran explicitly will still get the 4.9 version.\nAnyway, creating the symlink is easy:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gfortran-4.8 /usr/local/bin/gfortran\n\nThis has the pleasant side-effect that you can leave your packages in place, fulfilling whatever dependencies you might need to fulfil. And upgrades to the gfortran package won't nuke our changes.\n", "Q: Why doesn't apt-get autoremove remove my old kernels? My boot partition is on a SSD, so it doesn't have room for more than about 8 installed kernel versions, and eventually some kernel update will fail to install because my boot partition is full of old versions. There are many questions out there about how to remove old versions (even how to automate the process), but my question is simply this: Why doesn't apt-get autoremove detect and remove them automatically, and is there a way I can make it do so? I mean, apt-get is what installed them anyway, so it knows about them, so why does it choose to leave all old versions around?\n\nA: As to answer why , refer to the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels\n\nAs you can see, apt is told to never autoremove the kernels , as told by another (script) file, /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal. And here it is:\n\nIf you manually install 2 chosen kernels, ie the first and the current one, then apt-autoremove will only ever remove the older versions you didn't manually install, so you will always have those 2 options plus whatever the latest one is.\nUpdate:\nIn the /etc/kernel/postinst.d/apt-auto-removal there is this part:\nif [ \"$latest_version\" != \"$installed_version\" ] \\\n   || [ \"$latest_version\" != \"$running_version\" ] \\\n   || [ \"$installed_version\" != \"$running_version\" ]\nthen\n        # We have at least two kernels that we have reason to think the\n        # user wants, so don't save the second-newest version.\n        previous_version=\nfi\n\nSo if you compare the output of 01autoremove-kernels file and uname -r you'll realize that the currently running kernel and the most recent before it, are kept to be never removed by that script. There turns out is another file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove, where there is lines:\n    APT\n    {\n      NeverAutoRemove\n      {\n            \"^firmware-linux.*\";\n            \"^linux-firmware$\";\n      };\n  VersionedKernelPackages\n  {\n        # linux kernels\n        \"linux-image\";\n        \"linux-headers\";\n        \"linux-image-extra\";\n        \"linux-signed-image\";\n        # kfreebsd kernels\n        \"kfreebsd-image\";\n        \"kfreebsd-headers\";\n        # hurd kernels\n        \"gnumach-image\";\n        # (out-of-tree) modules\n        \".*-modules\";\n        \".*-kernel\";\n        \"linux-backports-modules-.*\";\n        # tools\n        \"linux-tools\";\n  };\n\nSo you could comment these out, and it will allow you to auto-remove the kernels with apt-autoremove, though remember - do this at your own risk\n\nA: For me it helped to install latest (X)ubuntu (15.10). In earlier releases kernel packages may be marked as manually installed, at least, if installed by using Software Updater, so that sudo apt-get autoremove --purge can't delete them. There are bug reports concerning the issue: Bug #1175637, Bug #1439769\nIn earlier release, you could try to mark kernel packages automatically installed by sudo apt-mark auto $(apt-mark showmanual | grep -E \"^linux-([[:alpha:]]+-)+[[:digit:].]+-[^-]+(|-.+)$\") and run sudo apt-get autoremove --purge thereafter to see, if it makes difference. The command should still not remove kernels packages shown in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove-kernels, but it is safest to run apt-get autoremove with --dry-run option first.\nAlternatively, you could use linux-purge to purge old kernels even more selectively or even if they were manually installed.\n\nA: Try removing the old kernel packages first, but if the /boot/initrd.img files remain, then this worked for me:\nTo remove  /boot/initrd.img-4.8.0-39-generic\nsudo update-initramfs -d -k 4.10.0-37-generic\n\nRemove one initrd.img file at a time.\n", "Q: Gray desktop after updating XFCE on Xubuntu Lately, I've been trying to run multiple monitors on Xubuntu without having them cloned. On the internet, I found some instructions to do that which basically required me to add a PPA in order to upgrade XFCE to 4.12. I added the PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xubuntu-dev/xfce-4.12\nthen upgraded:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nHowever, after a reboot, I noticed that my desktop background went completely gray and when I move windows it changes (clearly some kind of an UI glitch). Now, I instantly ppa-purge'd the PPA, but the problem remains. My current XFCE version is 4.8 (at least that's what xfce4-about says). By the way, during the installation of the PPA I saw the nvidia driver is also being reloaded, so I'm not sure, could that be the problem, and if so: how do I fix it? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I spent hours trying to upgrade and downgrade packages, but the solution appears to have been a lot simpler than that. While researching, I found this question. The specific answer that helped is this one. All I did was:\nsudo apt-get install xfdesktop4\n\nand after a reboot, the icons and wallpaper appeared on my desktop. I hope this will be helpful for users experiencing the same problem in the future. Cheers.\n\nA: I had this happen to me just a few days ago on xenial (16.04). Background was black though. No icons anywhere and some applications didn't at all (I tested Evince and Synaptic). Probably after a upgrade?\nAnyways, I did try to clean session cache but it didn't help. but then i reinstalled xfdesktop4 and I got it back. A bit simpler than the whole upgrading business. Though of course that applied to a different version.\nsudo apt install --reinstall xfdesktop4\n\nDid the trick for me. After reboot.\n", "Q: increase screen refresh rate for external monitor?

The following line of code changes to 1024x768 at 60Hz:\nxrandr -s 0 -r 60\n\nWhere -s will change your resolution to the the one specified in the number zero and -r will change your refresh rate to 60Hz.\n", "Q: How do I update NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu 14.04? I have a GTX 640 4 GB. I need help with drivers and how to install them please. I'm still very new to Ubuntu. I've been using it as my dedicated OS for about a week but I can't get my graphics card working properly.\n\nA: \nI used to run an older version of Ubuntu, some seven years ago, on a machine that had an Nvidia Geforce card installed. To install the proprietary graphics drivers, I had to direct my browser to the nvidia website and select the appropriate options. \nNow, it seems to me that \"GTX 640\" may not actually be the card's name. There is no \"GTX\" 640; however, there is a GT 640 in the same family of GeForce cards. To be sure, run the command: \nlspci | grep -i \"vga\" \n\nin your terminal emulator of preference. (lspci prints all the pci devices installed in your machine. | takes that output and \"pipes\" it to grep, the search command, -i tells grep to ignore the case of the search string: \"vga,\" which will single out your graphics card.) The output should look something like this:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\nexcept with your gpu's information instead. \nIf my assumption is correct: that you meant \"GeForce GT 640;\" then all you need to do is navigate to the page I linked, select the Product Type (GeForce), Product Series (600), Product (GT 640), Operating System (Linux 32 or 64 bit, if you don't know which, see below), and Language (default is English). Press search, and on the next page, download the binary, NVIDIA-Linux-architecture.version.run. (<-that is a mock file name, the important part is that it ends in the extention .run)\n(to find out whether you are running 32 or 64 bit architecture, run:\nuname -i\n\nyou may also be interested in the output of the -a option.)\nOpen a terminal, change your working directory to the directory where the downloaded driver installer is kept. (If you are browsing with FireFox, the default location is ~/Downloads). execute it with:\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-architecture.version.run\n\nAgain, that is a mock file name.

Now, I have lost Grub and my PC boot Windows automatically. There's any way to push the ubuntu entry to the EFI partition to boot Ubuntu again?\n\nA: The EFI partition just contains a FAT filesystem, so you can mount it, create a directory /EFI/ubuntu and copy /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed/grubx64.efi.signed into /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi and /usr/lib/shim/shim.efi.signed into /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi.  Now if your nvram boot entry was deleted,m you will need to use efibootmgr to create another.  One real benefit of UEFI is that the bootloaders are just files which may be copied around.

I created a script to dd sdb to sdc on my older computer with Ubuntu 13. It ran when I clicked on it – asked if I wanted to run in terminal or edit it.

The updater installed nVidia driver (I don't know why the updater installed nvidia because the ubuntu I use can not see the nvidia graphics card installed; it's a VM on Windows that does not support 3D graphics). Then, after I reboot and log in, only a wallpaper writing \"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\" lies on the desktop. Answers to Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears does not work to restore the unity left panel and topbar, so I checked and checked to convince myself that that's because of the nvidia driver. So I uninstalled nvidia driver completely using the answer to How can I uninstall a nvidia driver completely ?. Then I reboot. Then after I input my password in the login, the same login window comes out again, again and again. I have also tried all commands in unity and the tray are not displayed after login, but the same problem persists.

So I need your help to pull me out of this trouble. If you need any information, please comment. Thanks a lot.\n\n\nA: It seems a lot of people are having boot issues with the latest update. It appears it has to do with the newest kernel. It happened to me as we'll and I had to reinstall everything before I did a little research.

Tomorrow I once I'm at my office I can help you remove the new kernel. \n", "Q: No wifi connection for Centrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 I am a new Ubuntu user; I recently switched over from Windows (pats self on back).  However, I can't seem to figure out how to get my wireless connection to work.  The only way for my connection to work at the moment is by Ethernet cable.  Basically, I can detect all of the connection sites in my area, but once I select the one I want and I type in the password, it thinks for a moment possibly trying to get me connected then it brings me back to the password window.  I've ensured I'm using the correct password, and I don't know what to do at this point.  Any direction you could offer would be greatly appreciated.  \nMy network controller is: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150\nThank you for your time!\n\nA: How odd.  It sees the wireless device, and even its connections, but won't connect.  I've heard that a lot lately, but so far only about version 14.04 and 14.10.  Maybe I should just be glad I'm still using 12.04?\nI suppose it could be that the default driver your wifi device is using isn't quite right.\nGenerally speaking, if you are connected to the internet using a wired connection and perform and update, drivers for such hardware will automatically be installed.  Not always but mostly.  It is always my first thing I try.\nHave you tried clicking on additional drivers under system settings?\n\nA: That is one of the newer Intel Wifi Cards: it currently does not have native support--as far as I can tell. What you need is the right firmware. I have found the firmware for Centrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 as well as brief instructions on the installation of firmware.\nDownload the corresponding firmware tarball. (iwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1.tgz)\nUnpack the tarball, change into it's uncompressed directory, and move the iwlwifi-6050-4.ucode file to the firmware directory, /lib/firmware.\nuser@bash-X900V:pwd$ tar -xvzf iwlwifi-6050-ucode*\niwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1/\niwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1/LICENSE.iwlwifi-6050-ucode\niwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1/README.iwlwifi-6050-ucode\niwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1/iwlwifi-6050-4.ucode\n\nuser@bash-X900V:pwd$ cd iwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1/\nuser@bash-X900V:pwd/iwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1$ sudo mv iwlwifi-6050-4.ucode /lib/firmware/\nuser@bash-X900V:pwd/iwlwifi-6050-ucode-9.201.4.1$ sudo reboot\n\nReboot and pray.\n\nA: Even I did face the same issue.

(4 years old)\nWorked with an old windows machine that quit some time ago. On the old windows machine it connected via a wireless dongle and software installed from a cd.\nIs it possible to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick up / send communication to the wireless camera? How would I even find it, its not connected to the router.\n\n*Access the camera wirelessly without the dongle, its broken.\n\n\nThe camera is on, I did a nmap on my router but no ip is assigned to it. There is no USB to connect to the cam. Its strictly wireless. I am on a laptop with wireless, hoping there is a way to connect. directly via wireless.\nThe goal is to have this running as a baby monitor again.. Any suggestions welcomed!\n\nA: Unless you can find documentation about the camera indicating that it uses a standard for wireless such as bluetooth or wifi, it probably isn't compatible with anything else.  You might be able to get a replacement from ebay or the manufacturer.  \nMy advice to you would be to look into modern alternatives.  dlink sells a wireless security camera for only about $25, although I've seen them as slow as $15, which is pretty easy to setup with ubuntu, windows or mac.  If the camera doesn't need to be wireless, you can pick usb webcams as low as $3 if you don't mind shopping around.\nIn the meantime let's see what we can find out about yours.  Please take a close look at yours and report back with the brand, model, etc.  I can't look it up based on your description.  \"OLD\" isn't quite detailed enough.\nRest of the answer:\nThank you for providing the brand and model.  I believe I have discovered all that you need.  It seems that even if this product is discontinued, which does not seem to be the case, the company is still around so you can probably order a replacement receiver.  I've also found the user manual in PDF format which you can read as I have done.  It doesn't appear that the wireless system used is directly compatible with home wifi routers so it would seem you need to acquire a replacement receiver.\n", "Q: how do i boot up into ubuntu on an acer aspire v5 froma flash drive/disk? I plug in the USB with Ubuntu on it and i press f12 and i click USB but it just goes into normal windows. And after trying multiple times it still dosent work need help?\n\nA: When you first boot the pc, there should be some sort of notice on the screen which might say press F12 to boot to alternate media.  If it says F12 then you are using the correct key.  If it is not working the problem could be that your flash drive wasn't written properly.  To test it, try booting a different, preferably older PC.  If it works on other PCs but not this one it could be that the v5 employs an EFI bios which is problematic for ubuntu boot media but not completely impossible.\n\nA: If you're just having trouble getting the PC to boot from the USB, or if the Ubuntu USB wasn't created successfully, this help page has instructions that should help with eiter case: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nSpecifically the sections:\n\nBooting the Computer from USB\nRemove all unneeded USB items, but keep the network cable attached.\nInsert the bootable USB flash drive that you just created in your\n  target computer and restart it. Most newer computers can boot from a\n  USB flash drive. If your computer does not automatically do so, you\n  might need to edit the BIOS settings.\nRestart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key\n  to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2,\n  DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit\n  your BIOS settings. (On HP Mini Netbooks, they correct key is usually\n  F9.)\nInstead of editing BIOS settings, you can chose a boot device from the\n  boot menu. Press the function key to enter the boot menu when your\n  computer is booting. Typically, the boot screen displays which key you\n  need to press. It maybe one of F12, F10. Note: with some motherboards\n  you have to select 'hard disk/USB-HDD0' to choose the USB flash disk.\n  It may work like this because the system sees the USB drive 'a mass\n  storage device' as a hard disk drive, and it should be at the top of\n  the boot order list.\nSo you need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer, and\n  how your USB key was formatted, you should see an entry for \"removable\n  drive\" or \"USB media\". Move this to the top of the list to make the\n  computer attempt to boot from the USB device before booting from the\n  hard disk.\n\nOr maybe it's trouble with Creating a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive from Windows, where you can use these (there's info on creating from other OS's on the page too):\n\n\n*\n\n*PenDriveLinux's Universal USB Installer [Not listed on the help page but very good]\n\n*Linux Live Usb Creator\n\n*Unetbootin\n\n*Win32DiskImager\nOr you may have UEFI troubles\n\nUEFI\nThere is a good wiki page about booting with UEFI, and a good tutorial\n  thread, UEFI Installing - Tips.\nIf you want to boot in UEFI mode and install your Ubuntu flavour\n  alongside Windows, you should use a 64-bit ISO file, for example\nubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso\ndirectly and not via grub2.\nCreating an EFI-only image\nIf you need to install Ubuntu in EFI-only mode, you might want to\n  create a EFI only image.

Run terminal and type in this command\n\n/usr/sbin/sshd\n\nnow you can connect to the device using ssh from your computer by (something like)\n\nssh phablet@192.168.1.100\n\nUse the passwword you put in when switching to developers mode. The IP address needs to be IP of your phone of course. If you do not know it, just run ifconfig command in terminal of your phone and look for IP near wlan interface.\nIf you want to make it easier next time, copy the key from your computer to mobile by\n\nssh-copy-id phablet@192.168.1.100\n\nnext time you won't need the password and you may even disable the developers mode.

(And my fried too. I have 2 ASUS comps and my fried has DELL)\n\nA: I am having sometimes the same issue. It is not caused by recursion itself but by Linux going out of memory. Linux lets programs to allocate as much space as they need until there is absolutely no memory left. Because of this, your machine becomes unable to handle primitive operations.\nWindows behaves in slightly another way. It leaves some free space for it's needs. Your code would get \"Out of memory\" error, and the system would work very slow for a little bit, but not totally freeze.\nThe same idea is used by fork-bomb attack, which takes all the memory in the system so quick that even killall is unable to run.\nIf your program takes so much memory uncontroled, it will soon die and then Linux would run OK. The only way that helped me in making it faster currently is to send Ctrl-C to the terminal where your code is launched from or trying to run killall.\n", "Q: After Upgrade from 11.10 to 14.04, Laptop Keyboard Keys Not Working The keys that don't work are: F11, F12, Hyphen, Opening Square Bracket, Forward Slash, Insert, Numpad: Forward Slash, Numpad: Star, Numpad: Minus, Numpad: 7, Numpad: 8\nHow do I restore them to a functioning state?

The Canonical Distribution of Ubuntu OpenStack directions state the following (see Build OpenStack with conjure-up | Ubuntu.com):\n\nInstalling Ubuntu OpenStack requires at least seven machines with two disks, two of which have two network interfaces (NICs).\n\nInstead of using seven machines, has anyone done this with seven docker containers?  If so, does anyone already have the docker files to do this? !\n\nA: Can you build an OpenStack cloud in Docker containers using the OpenStack Autopilot? No.\nThere are multiple ways you can build and deploy OpenStack on Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*(easiest) use the OpenStack Autopilot. As you noticed, currently this requires 7 machines.  \n\n*Juju.  You can use Juju to deploy and configure OpenStack services. You need to install MAAS and Juju, but you do not need to know about OpenStack as much.\n\n*(hardest) Apt. follow the installation guide for Ubuntu on OpenStack.org, and build your configuration manually. You will need to learn quite a bit about OpenStack.\nAll three solutions require hardware, because OpenStack is infrastructure, and while it can be faked to test patches, OpenStack with almost no hardware is... hardly useful.\nIf you want to test OpenStack in the small scale, not for production, I recommend for now you use:\napt-get install openstack \n\nand try the single system cloud configuration you can build there. In alternative, you can try DevStack, which also gives you a (hardly realistic) cloud packed into one box.\nFinally, I hear the next beta of the OpenStack Autopilot may require fewer hardware resources for non-HA configurations. You may want to wait a few weeks until that's out and see if we managed to bring the bar low enough for you - you will still need a few machines, but not 7.\n", "Q: Can I make gedit embedded terminal cd automatically to the current file's directory? How to make gedit terminal itself to change directory to the location of the file which is opened currently in gedit?\nAs by default i have to cd till i get to present file location in my gedit-embedded terminal.\nI know there is no direct way to do so.\nBut if any long way is also possible, I really want the embedded terminal itself to make dynamically change directory as per  currently opened file in whatever current tab is opened in gedit.\n\nA: To my own surprise, it can be done. In the 45 minutes I tested it, it worked quite well actually, and didn't fail on me once.\nNevertheless, it should be considered an experimental option, since it is done completely \"from outside\", so to speak, with the help of xprop, wmctrl and xdotool. To use it, you will have to accept a few peculiarities: it works well as long as you have all files tabbed in one window, and your mouse click, to select tabs, should be a real click: if you \"hold\" the click, the tab is opened in a new window.\nYou should also be aware of the fact that the different gedit tabs (files) share one embedded terminal window. That means that the cd command will be performed on tab switch, no matter what might be running in the terminal.\nAlltogether, you will have to see if it works stable enough in your situation and if it behaves well in the way you use it.\nHow it works\nThe main trick is based on the fact that gedit by default has the file's directory in its window name. That is used to extract the targeted directory, and set it, if it changes (by clicking another tab of the gedit window).\nA script, running in the background, checks:\n\n\n*\n\n*if gedit runs (at all)\n\n*if so, it checks if the frontmost window is a gedit window\n\n*if that is the case, it checks if the currently frontmost file's directory is different from the last check, so another tab must have been clicked (since 1 second ago). This also prevents needless cd actions if two tabs work in the same directory (that is: if all files are tabbed in one window).\n\n\nThen, if a cd action is needed, the script moves the mouse to the middle of the gedit window (x-wise), 70 px from the bottom of the window (y-wise), which will definitely be on the terminal section of the window. Then it clicks, types thecd command + Enter. You will hardly notice, since the mouse is moved back to its original position. You will need to give it time (appr. 0.5 second) to perform the cd before you continue to work, but again, You will probably not notice the delay at all.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*If not yet on your system, install wmctrl and xdotool first:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as set_directory.py\n\n*Run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/set_directory.py\n\n\n*I suggest you run it from a (minimized) gnome-terminal window while you are working with gedit + embedded terminal; to have it running permanently seems a bit overkill for such a specific task.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport socket\nimport time\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\nlast_dr = \"\"\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    try:\n        return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except:\n        return \"\"\n\ndef execute(cmd):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\ndef get_windowid():\n    cmd = \"xprop -root\"\n    frontmost = [l for l in get(cmd).splitlines() if \"ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0].split()[-1]\n    return frontmost[:2]+\"0\"+frontmost[2:]\n\ndef get_dirfromname(name):\n    dr = name[name.find(\"(\")+1:name.find(\")\")].replace(\" \", \"\\\\ \")\n    if \"~\" in dr:\n        dr = dr[dr.find(\"~\"):]\n    if os.path.exists(dr.replace(\"~\", home+\"/\")):\n        return dr\n    else:\n        return None\n\ndef cd(coords, dr):\n    currmouse = get(\"xdotool getmouselocation\").split()[:2]\n    currcoords = (\" \").join([it.split(\":\")[-1] for it in currmouse])\n    x_set = str(int((int(coords[0])+int(coords[2])/2)))\n    y_set = str(int(int(coords[1])+int(coords[3])-70))\n    execute(\"xdotool mousemove \"+x_set+\" \"+y_set+\"&&xdotool click 1\")\n    execute(\"xdotool type 'cd \"+dr+\"'\"+\"&&xdotool key KP_Enter\")\n    execute(\"xdotool mousemove \"+currcoords)\n\ndef update_directory():\n    global last_dr\n    try:\n        pid = get(\"pidof gedit\")\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n    else:\n        wid = get_windowid()\n        wdata = get(\"wmctrl -lpG\")\n        wdata = [l for l in wdata.splitlines() if pid in l and wid in l] if len(wdata) != 0 else []\n        if len(wdata) != 0:\n            wdata = wdata[0]; coords = wdata.split()[3:7]\n            wname = wdata.split(socket.gethostname()+\" \")[-1]\n            dr = get_dirfromname(wname)\n            if dr != None and dr != last_dr:\n                time.sleep(1)\n                cd(coords, dr)\n                last_dr = dr\n\nwhile True:\n    update_directory()\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nAutomatically set the working directory to the currently front most file:\n\ncd on tab switch\n\nThe built-in cd menu of the gedit terminal\nAn alternative, almost with the same comfort, could be the gedit terminal built in function.

Please see the follwing screenshot:\n\nCan someone instruct me how to do that? I'm afraid to lost the data in my main partition. \n\nA: Here is the general approach you would be taking. You first have to boot into a live Ubuntu environment. To do that, burn an Ubuntu image on a CD/DVD/USB and boot from it as if you're installing Ubuntu but choose \"Try Ubuntu\" instead of \"Install Ubuntu\", then open GParted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on sda5 and Delete. So you'll end up with sda6, sda7, followed by a big unallocated space.\n\n*Right click on sda7 (swap) and Delete (if Delete is grayed out, choose Swapoff first). We'll recreate it later. So now you'll end up with sda6 followed by a big unallocated space.\n\n*Right click on sda6 and choose Resize/Move, and drag the right arrow to the right to fill up that space. Now you're \"expanding\" sda6, but don't expand it til the end. Leave 8 GBs in the end. Once done, click OK. Now you'll end up with a larger sda6 and 8 GB of unallocated space.\n\n*Right click the unallocated space, choose New, then choose linux-swap as the filesystem. Click OK.\n\n*Now your table in GParted should show your merged (and large) sda6, followed by (I think it might be) sda8 which is the swap partition. If you made any mistakes, close GParted and start over again. But if all looks good, click apply to apply all the changes we did. This might take sometime.\n\n*Once done, reboot and remove the CD/DVD/USB to go back into your Ubuntu. Open a terminal and type sudo blkid /dev/sda8 (I'm assuming that sda8 is the partition number for the new swap partition we created). Copy the UUID=#### part. Type sudo nano /etc/fstab. Look for the line that looks like this:\n# swap was on /dev/sda7 during installation\nUUID=###### none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nAnd change that UUID to the one you copied from the previous command. Save and close by Ctrl+X, Y, then Enter.\n\n*Reboot and you're done.\n", "Q: How can I run a command at start-up on Ubuntu server not as root? Occasionally (it's pretty rare) my VPS provider has to reboot my VPS in order to fix issues or apply a patch. Is there any way to run commands as my user automatically once the VPS reboots? I've read about putting scripts in /etc/rc.local but my understanding is that those scripts will be run as root. In particular I would like to run the following commands:\nscreen -U -S Irssi irssi\nscreen -S rtorrent rtorrent\n\nThis way Irssi will automatically reconnect to its IRC servers and rtorrent will begin seeding again so that they don't have to wait for me to see the email from my VPS provider, login, and restart them manually.

Im using Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS and im kinda newbie \n\nA: I had similar issue in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 LTS, running kernel version 3.13.0-43. I added an HDMI display (no sound capability) to my desktop as an addition to my older DVI monitor. Attempting to add the new screen from boot/power-on caused a system freeze. Attempts to add the HDMI display after boot via the Display applet under Settings Manager prompted a scrambled screen and system or X crashed (couldn't tell which one, screen unresponsive to anything but hard power cycle).\nBooting to an earlier kernel version -in this case 3.13.0-40- resolved the issue (you can boot to prior kernels under the Advanced options in the Grub boot menu).\nInterestingly, I found a strikingly similar issue with kernel 3.17.3 (Kernel Bug Tracker – Bug 88481) that had the exact same error message I had been getting from DMESG: BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffec2000000900. This seems to have possibly been brought on by commit ffe0245532b98efc4bc0e06f29c51d3f0e471152 in at least the case of the later kernel version.\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*Bug 88481 - Kernel oops leaves system without graphical output [radeon] \n\n*https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88481\nHTH.\n", "Q: How to fix \"EXT4-fs (sda1): re-mounted.

It may happen e.g. during a normal system startup if /dev/sda1 is your root partition. \nThe mount option means that the system should mount the partition read-only if an error occurs to minimize further damage or data loss and is used by default.\n", "Q: Libdvdread4 not available from videolan?

I use Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. I read this link: \"How can I use DropBox as a simple backup?\" which suggests to backup using deja-dup to the Dropbox folder. However, if I would do this, the backups will also be placed on my local harddrive, which takes up a lot of space. If I unsync the specific dropbox folder, I cannot access it anymore from Nautilus. Importing  a manually created .tar file (+/- 50 Gb) to the unsynced Dropbox folder using the Dropbox Web application is very slow. Does anybody have a good solution for this? Thanks!\n\nA: One option I can think of, perhaps is to use the Dropbox API, and a carefully crafted curl command to send your file up to your dropbox.

I recently bought a 2TB WD Black hard drive and installed it in an enclosure to use as media storage for my Micca Spect media player. The installation went well and I booted into Ubuntu (14.04 LTS with full drive and home folder encryption) to format the drive. I don't recall creating any partitions, I just clicked on the main drive selection and formatted it in NTFS. It looked like everything went well, until the next time I plugged it in. Now, the GUI of the hard drive in the 'Disks' program shows several partitions that I know I didn't intentionally create and I get different errors when I try to delete them or reformat them. The drive also appears twice in the sidebar. I'll include images and as much detail as possible.\nFirst, here is a screenshot of the free space and partitions: \n\nHere is what it looks like when I click on the other entry for the same hard drive: \n\nNote that for this entry, the \"format\" option and other options are grayed out and I can't do anything. Also this entry remains in the sidebar when I disconnect the hard drive.\nWhen I click on Partition 1 the device path is /dev/sdb1 and for partition 2 it is /dev/sdb2 while BOTH free space entries are /dev/sdb .\nWhen I click on 'Partition 1', click the minus sign, and choose 'remove' I get the following error: \nError deleting partition /dev/sdb1: Command-line `parted --script \"/dev/sdb\" \"rm 1\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1:   \nError: /dev/sdb: unrecognised disk label (udisks-error-quark, 0)  \n\nWhen I do the same for partition 2, I get this error: \nError deleting partition /dev/sdb2: Command-line `parted --script \"/dev/sdb\" \"rm 2\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1:   \nError: /dev/sdb: unrecognised disk label (udisks-error-quark, 0)  \n\nWhen I try to reformat either partition I get this error:\nError synchronizing after initial wipe: Timed out waiting for object (udisks-error-quark, 0)  \n\nI was getting another error before that I am now having trouble reproducing, but it said something along the lines of \"it's possible the drive was formatted without being partitioned\" or something like that, which sounds like what I did. \nI tried erasing and reformatting several different ways and always get an error. There is no data on the drive, and it's brand new. All I want to do is wipe it clean and restore it to the way it was when I got it so I can try partitioning and formatting it again. I want a single 2TB partition formatted in NTFS to store movies on for playing off my Micca Spect media player. I would really appreciate some help here, I'm hoping I didn't just destroy a brand new and expensive hard drive.\nA note about my computer skills: I prefer GUI solutions, however I am able to use the command line provided you walk me through it. Again, there's no data or anything, all I want is a blank 2TB NTFS formatted hard drive. As a last resort, I would be willing to pay someone to fix it, or would this be covered under warranty? Do you think I can call NewEgg and get a replacement? After all, I did follow the instructions that came with the enclosure (although, the problem seems to be with the drive.)\nThank you in advance for any help. This drive cost about $150 and I need it working within the next week, so I would be very happy if someone is able to help me fix it.\nUPDATE 12/21/2014:\nThank you for the answers, what ended up working was running gparted, creating a new partition with the default ms-dos filesystem, and then formatting that partition with NTFS, all done with gparted. I guess the default \"Disks\" utility could not read the hard drive properly, it looks like I formatted with NTFS without first creating a partition. Anyway, all it working well now. I haven't checked if it works with the Micca Spect yet, but the drive itself is working.\n\nA: Maybe the \"Micca Spect media player\" you mention did some formatting of the HD on it's own, I'm not sure if you were trying to use the HD with the player already. And does \"The installation went well and I booted into Ubuntu (14.04 LTS with full drive and home folder encryption)\" refer to anything that was done to the HD in question?\nI wouldn't use Disks (gnome-disk-utility) for any serious partitioning, it lists the Partitioning as \"Unknown ()\" for /dev/sdb, and there shouldn't be a 2nd entry for a regular HD - it doesn't even list a device either. Maybe it doesn't know about or has bugs with GPT partitioning, which I'm suspecting is the problem, especially given your error \"... without being partitioned.\" But your error messages mention parted, could still be Disks' problem though.\nTry gparted instead, it's a nice reliable gui for parted, and knows about GPT partitioning. May need to write a new Partition table too, then partition/format.\nAnd could run sudo parted -l to see partition info about all your devices. (For fun, sudo fdisk -l would show similar info, but it doesn't know about GPT).\nI would also consider the possibility that the HD enclosure you're using is doing something funny, or the USB cable, hub, ports, etc... taking the HD out of the enclosure & plugging the HD directly into a computer is a backup plan.\nSearching for the \"Error: /dev/sdb: unrecognised disk label (udisks-error-quark, 0)\" message gets a few results where the HD is failing too...\n\nA: If you really formatted the /dev/sdb, then you wiped out the original partition table.  You should then be able to mount the /dev/sdb with the loopback option to mount, but since there's nothing on the disk, forget that and just run a disk partitioning tool and create a new partition table -- forget trying to \"erase\" or format anything, the raw filesystem which has replaced the partition info confuses the tools.  Of the two disks you see, one is probably a backup of some kind.  Anyway, create a new partition table, create an ntfs partition, and format it. \n", "Q: How to rotate a specific window in 90ْ ​​? Is there a way to rotate a specific window and not the whole screen?\n\nA: The Freewins plugin for compiz is supposed to be able to do that.\nThe support status of the plugin is a bit unclear. It can be installed by typing apt-get install compiz-plugins, but for a long time I could not figure out how to get it to do anything other than cause selected windows to \"permanently\" lose focus until compiz is restarted.\nAn answer from three years ago says it is no longer supported and recommends not using it as it could cause system freezes. It recommends an alternative which supports some of the features of Freewins, but unfortunately not window rotation.\nIn my experience compiz freezes can happen even without installing this plugin, but when they do happen the system can be unfrozen by ssh to the machine and running DISPLAY=:0 compiz --replace. I do not know if the freezes that Freewins allegedly cause are any harder to fix than those which can happen in a standard compiz install. So far I haven't seen it cause a problem that could not be fixed by restarting compiz.\nIf you want to give that plugin a try, I recommend your first learn how to restart compiz remotely, in case you should need to do so. Secondly I recommend you disable the two options Prevent Input and Immediate Moves, as those seem to be causing the most trouble.\nAdditionally, there is a setting deciding which windows are allowed to be rotated. I haven't figured out exactly how it works, but it appears that \"old-skool\" applications such as xterm cannot be rotated.\nctrlshifte and ctrlshiftq can be used to rotate the window in focus. ctrlshiftr will return to normal orientation (though sometimes I had to press it a few times before it worked).\nI couldn't get rotation by using the mouse to work at all. And a rotated window could not be focused using the mouse, but it could be selected using alttab.\n\nA: To rotate a certain window, press shift+ctrl then drag on the window you want to rotate. But, this method could cause shadow glitches, the rotated window appearing as a square in the switch window GUI, slowness and possibly your computer freezing.\n\nA: I know of a \"cheating\" way to do it, one screenshot at a time...\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab a screenshot (Print Scrn)\n\n*Open screenshot in GIMP (or the default viewer if it can do 3.)\n\n*Rotate image 90ْ\n\n\nAnd vlc can rotate a video to any angle you want. If you could get vlc to open only part of your Desktop (in Capture Device) you might be able to rotate it's display to see a \"live\" view of the window too...\n", "Q: cannot install php5-mysql I have ubuntu 32bit server (14.04), running php5,\nI am trying to install php5-mysql\nbut I get a dependancy error.

It will run a fully working live system. No need to install or modify any partition!\nThe rescue system is meant to repair Ubuntu. not Windows.\nAfter it has booted up, you can start the file manager.

I have SystemBack ver. 1.1.3.110 (etc) installed on my PC, running Ubuntu 14.04.\nI've noticed that almost every time there are updates for my OS and programs, there is an update for SystemBack. \nIt requires more \"updates\" than any other program on my computer, by far. This has me a bit concerned. I appreciate programs being kept up-to-date.\nIs SystemBack \"stable\"?\nDoes it refrain from secret \"data mining\"?\n\nA: data mining? If you're using regular tools to update like apt that's basically just your computer downloading files. \nI'm not familiar with SystemBack to know what it should & shouldn't do, but this looks like it's launchpad page if you'd like to browse the source code.\nThere should be a changelog somewhere to see when the last updates were, there could've been a bunch released close together recently. \nI think I found it, https://code.launchpad.net/~nemh/systemback/devel does show 5 updates this month, and 5 more in the last 2 days of November. \nOr I thought I saw a \"daily\" branch that likely gets updated more frequently, you could be in too. You might want to switch to the \"systemback/stable\" branch it seems to have less frequent updates and would hopefully be more stable, but I'm not sure if those are in a Ubuntu PPA. \n", "Q: Route subnet requests from wlan0 to eth0 on Ubuntu 14.04 My raspberry pi is connected via Ethernet to my Ubuntu 14.04 machine (192.168.1.0/24 on eth0).\nThis machine is connected to the Internet through a Fritz Box WLAN Router (192.168.0.0/24 on wlan0).\nThe network topology diagram: \n\nTo have internet access on my raspberry, I've successfully enabled IP forwarding (net.ipv4.ip_forward) on the Ubuntu machine and configured it's eth0 IP 192.168.1.1 as default gateway on the raspberry.

That wiped all data in the disk and it turns out it also fixed the problem.\n\nA: When you ran mount only sda5 (your /) was mounted, and it was read-write (rw) so you should be able to write to it. Normally, most of the directories like /sys, /bin are only writeable by root (you'd need sudo first), but your home folder should be writeable to your regular user.\nCan you create any files in your home folder? Maybe your gui file manager is stuck thinking they're read-only, if you try in a terminal does it work? For example, do these commands work?:\ncd ~\ntouch newfile001\necho stuff >> newfile001\ncat newfile001\n\nIf those work successfully then you can write to your HD (sda5).\n\nFor the USB drive, after it's plugged in and mounted, look at mount to find it (the /dev/sdb1 ... line) and see if the mount option in the ()'s is rw (read-write) then you should be able to write to it. If it's ro (read-only) try this and see if it changes:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdb1 /media/simon/LYDIA\n\nIf the filesystem (fs) has errors it may get mounted as ro, there should be messages about it in dmesg & /var/log/syslog too. This is what your logs show:\n[  159.366772] FAT-fs (sdb1): Volume was not properly unmounted. Some data may  \nbe corrupt. Please run fsck.\n[  159.383252] FAT-fs (sdb1): error, fat_get_cluster: invalid cluster chain (i_pos 0)\n[  159.383258] FAT-fs (sdb1): Filesystem has been set read-only\n\nThat includes a clue to how the fs could have gotten corrupted - \"not properly unmounted\", you should always unmount before unplugging anything. Most file managers have an \"eject\" to help with that.\nThe dmesg log also say how to fix it: fsck can try to fix fs errors, it attempts to pick the right check program, or you can pick one explicitly with fsck.vfat or fsck.[other] pressing TAB after fsck. should list options.  \n\n\n*\n\n*For a FAT system (often have to run it twice, doesn't always fix all errors the first time)\n\n*\n\n*fsck.vfat -vaV [device] should work automatically (-a) & display more info (-v) & do a \"verification\" pass (-V), or just:\n\n*fsck.vfat -a [device]\nNOTE: This will not guarantee that the filesystem will stay fixed, it could get corrupted again & it may be impossible to know exactly why. Always unmount / \"eject\" before removing USB drives.\nNote if a fs mounts as rw, but then errors are seen & it gets automatically remounted as ro, the mount command may still report it's mounted rw. Looking at this file with less /proc/mounts should usually show more reliable information (see man mount).\n\nIf something is mounted rw but you still can't add/delete/edit files on it, you may not be the owner of the files. In some fs's you can chown to become the owner, but a FAT32 fs like on sdb1 doesn't have those permissions; they're set when it mounts with the mount option uid=value (value is your userid, learn it with echo $UID or id -u) then you can try this & see if it works afterwards:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw,uid=[userid] /dev/sdb1 /media/simon/LYDIA\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Sometimes, you may need to restart your gui file manager to get it to \"notice\" the mount change that lets you write to the filesystem/drive, but a terminal should always work.\n\n\nOr if the above doesn't work, try sudo su to \"become\" root, to see if anything can write to files on the USB (with touch, echo, etc)?\n\nA: Goto Disks.\nSelect your USB drive.\nClick on Additional partition options and select Format Partition.\nThen select erase Overwrite existing data with zeroes(slow) and type FAT.\nI have tried many things after searching on internet but this worked for me.\n\nA: This worked for me\nsudo su -\ndf -Th\numount /media/username/USBdriveName\ndosfsck -a /dev/sdb1\n\nIt should end with the message like this.\nfsck.fat 3.0.28 (2015-05-16)\n0x41: Dirty bit is set.

I am using Mint 17.1 Cinnamon, with the 3.13.0-43 kernel with and Caja as the file manager.\nWhen I looked at the media directory using this terminal command:\ndir /media\n\nI saw that the layout had changed. Normally, you expect to see the drives listed here, but now they are listed under your username, and guess what? That username has only ROOT permissions.\nWhat I did was to run:\nsudo chown [username] /media/[username]\n\nand:\nsudo chgrp [username] /media/[username]\n\nwhere I replaced [username] with my username. After that I removed the USB stick, waited and then put it back in. The problem was solved, I can now write to it!\n\nA: I got the same error when using GParted to set partition table and format my USB stick.. after that all USB drives went to \"read-only\".\nBut under root copying worked fine...\nIssue was gone after machine restart. So I guess that this problem may occur when using GParted.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem on Ubuntu, and none of the answers given here so far worked for me. Here's what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the device using GParted. I even tried re-creating the\npartition table, without success.\n\n*Check the device with fsck. No issues were found.\n\n*Fixed the permissions of the mount point. Turns out that the mount point was root owned, but even after making myself the owner, I could only write to the device from the command-line (I still could not create files from the GUI).\n\n\nWhen I connect a USB stick, it gets mounted under /media/<username>/<label>/, where <username> is my username and  <label> is the label of the USB stick or storage device.\nI looked again at the permissions:\n$ ls -ld /media/<username>\ndrwxrwx---+ 2 <username> <username> 4096 Mar  4 18:32 /media/<username>\n\nNotice the + at the end of the permissions. That's new to me and I never noticed it before. It means the directory has extended permissions called Access Control List (ACL) (see this related question). I listed the ACL details for this directory:\n$ getfacl /media/<username>\n# file: <username>/\n# owner: <username>\n# group: <username>\nuser::rwx\nuser:<username>:r-x\ngroup::---\nmask::r-x\nother::---\n\nAs you can see, there is an additional entry user:<username>:r-x for my username, which only gives me read access. I fixed this with a simple command:\nsetfacl -m u:<username>:rwx /media/<username>\n\nI detached my USB devide, attached it again, and the problem was solved.\n\nA: When you attach your USB key to your laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*run sudo -i (so that you won't type your password all the time)\n\n*run df -Th(to see where your USB stick is mounted)\n\n*unmount your USB stick \n\n*run dosfsck on the device you saw from your previous command. Example: dosfsck /dev/sdc1\n\n*remove and reattach your USB stick\n\n\nProblem should be solved now.\nNow, for your HDD, please follow the answer to this question. It is about an external HDD but it is the same thing for your case.\n\nA: As like in wayofthefuture's answer above when you're using Nemo (like me, if you use the Cinnamon desktop environment) try:\nkillall nemo\n\n\nA: Run the following commands on the terminal(ubuntu) to give write permission to a Pendrive.\n\n\n*\n\n*df -Th\n\n*umount /media/madusanka/KINGSTON\n\n\n*\n\n*\"/media/madusanka/KINGSTON\" is \"Mounted on\" value that is given by the first command\n\n\n*sudo dosfsck -a /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*\n\n*\"/dev/sdb1\" is \"Filesystem\" value that is given by the first command.\n\n\n*Enter your password\n\n*Check the Pendrive by pasting or creating a new file.\n\nA: Quick fix methods:\nMethod 1\nSometimes we can accomplish the task from bash without trouble\nI usually do (no sudo required)\nmkdir /media/$USER/mydrive/myfolder\ncp -r src/ /media/$USER/mydrive/myfolder\n\nHowever, sometimes, when I need to use file browser,\nsudo nautilus /media/$USER/mydrive/\n\nNote: this is a quick fix, use it only if you get frustrated because no other answers above worked\nMethod 2\nReboot OS \n\nA: try below strategies\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/fuse.conf as superuser\nchange #user_allow_other to user_allow_other\n\n*enable write support for external devices\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ntfs-config \n\n*sudo ntfs-config\n\nA: This is because your file system is NTFS and it is in an unsafe stat, maybe you are using your disk in windows, one of the reasons is that you hibernated the windows or fast restarted it., so use one of these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*unmount the media using the  below command, go to windows (maybe Dual boot mode or maybe in an another computer) and shut down the windows completely, not hibernate or fast restart, \nsudo umount /media/\"your media label\"\nthen come to Linux again and mount your media using this command:\n'sudo mount -o rw,mount /your media'\n\n\n\n*if you are using macOs , plug your media to your mac device and use this command:\n'sudo /usr/sbin/diskutil disableJournal /Volumes/name-of-media'\n\nA: All you need is following 3 commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*df -Th\nresult - \n\n\n\n*umount /media/user/KINGSTON (this is mount on path)\n\n*dosfsck -a /dev/sdb1 (this is Filesystem path)\n\n\nA: When you attach your Pendrive to your laptop:\n1. run sudo -i (so that you won't type your password all the time)\n2. run df -Th(to see where your USB stick is mounted)\n3. unmount your USB stick\n4. run dosfsck on the device you saw from your previous command.

Mount device now\n\nNow try to remove or add more files\n\nA: I have the same bug with Thunar (Xubuntu 16.04-18.04). Killing it wouldn't be an option as sometimes I already have opened Thunar windows that I need.\nI discovered a workaround.\nFirst, we need to turn off automount:\nSettings => Removable Drives and Media => Turn off first two options.\nSecond, after inserting the USB medium, right-click on it and choose \"Connect\". Or disconnect then connect using the right-click.\nIt is sad, that the workaround usually works with FAT, but doesn't always work with EXT4. :(\n\nA: One thing I find unique regarding Ubuntu users is that you guys find these ubiquitous problems, and solve them by trial and error. FAT file systems don't have acls, so changing those (chown, chmod, etc) won't be preserved. The changes are made in system memory and applied to the file systems with pointers.\nFAT wouldn't work with Linux if not for the pseudo-acls. It makes Linux think they're there, but they're just for compatibility. Ubuntu and most other *NIXs remount ro on file system errors. So if you run dosfsck on a file system that won't mount rw, and unplug and replug, it should mount rw.\nUDEV controls automounter, so depending on the way the rules are written, that can cause mount to switch to ro. You just have to look in the rules' files and figure out what it's doing in /sys`.\nBut it really looks pretty good, lots of solutions. Thanks everyone!\n\nA: What did it for me was plugging it in a different USB port on my machine; possibly a USB 1.0 or 2.0 one.\n\nA: I came up with this:\nhdparm -r /dev/sda1  ### to check the read-only flag\nhdparm -r0 /dev/sda1 ### to make read-only 0 (to turn it off)\n\n", "Q: Grub doesn't appear Ubuntu 14.04 I have a problem when I start my computer. The problem is that when I start the computer, grub doesn't appear but it is installed. Firstly, I installed Ubuntu instead of Fedora 21 (I had Windows 8.1 but it was erased too). Then, when I started the computer, the screen shown a purple frame and a black square inside. I tried to 're-install' grub, with the following commands:\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nI followed these instructions: Grub menu won't show up after updating Ubuntu, can boot only into Windows\nAt this point, I could see that when I started the computer, the screen shows a purple square, without the black frame. The grub config is by default.\nFurthermore, I tried to re-install Ubuntu and I made an installation from scratch, but it doesn't work again. I have the same issue.

I've looked around for quite a while and was surprised to not have found any information on this: \nHow is it possible to change the track order of a playlist I've created in Rhythmbox 3.02?\nSimple drag-and-drop does not work and there seems to be no other obvious way.\n\nA: It depends on the kind of playlist you created. \nAutomatic Playlist\nIf you created an \"Automatic\" playlist (i.e. one that has rules for including/excluding various kinds of files), you can change the order only by changing the sort criterion in the playlist edit box. \nHere's what the Edit Automatic Playlist dialog looks like:\n\nTo change your sort order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the checkbox beside \"Limit to:\"\nThis will enable the \"When sorted by:\" controls on the next line.\n\n*Choose the field by which you want your tracks sorted (Album, Artist, etc). You can also choose whether to sort in ascending or descending order.\n\n*If you don't want to limit the number of tracks in your playlist, uncheck the checkbox you enabled in step 1.\n\n*Click the Close button and you're done!\nStatic Playlist\nRhythmBox refers to playlists where you've explicitly added specific songs as Static.\nWhen you populate static playlists, RhythmBox always adds new tracks to the end, so you could change the order of this list by removing and adding tracks until they're in the order you want.\nBleah.\nFortunately, there is a somewhat easier way.\nRhythmbox stores the content for the static playlists, along with the rules for the Automatic ones, in a human-readable XML file. In order to change the order, you have to edit that file.\nThe file's (default) path is: ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/playlists.xml.\nTo change the order of a manually-created playlist:\n(NOTE: these instructions, while pretty basic, assume a certain amount of familiarity with Linux operations, like copying and editing files. If you don't know how to do these things, you'll need to look them up first.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Close RhythmBox, lest it overwrite the file you are about to edit.\n\n*Navigate to the directory containing the playlist file. (~/.local/share/rhythmbox/)\n\n*(Optional but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!) Copy the playlists.xml file to a backup file, in case you screw up. (To do so in a terminal, enter something like this command: cp playlists.xml playlists-backup.xml .)\n\n*Open the file (the original, not the backup) with your favourite text editor.\n\n*Find the particular playlist you want to edit. Each playlist is a playlist element, consisting of:\n\n\n*\n\n*an opening <playlist> tag\n\n*a location element for each track comprising the playlist, specifying the file path\n(Note that the file specifiers are URL-encoded, so – for instance – what would normally be a space in the file name will appear as %20. Take that into account if you are using your editor's search functionality to find a specific file!)\n\n*a closing <playlist> tag\nEach playlist element has a name attribute (among others), so if the playlist you want to edit is called Main, you can search for name=\"Main\".\n\n*Move a song:\n(Note: These are very basic directions, aimed at beginners. Experienced users of text editors will not need these.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the file you want to move.\n\n*highlight the entire line containing the location element of each track you want to move\n\n*cut out the selected text (usually Ctrl+X will do this)\n\n*place your cursor in the new location and paste the text you cut in the previous step (usually Ctrl+V)\n\n\n*Repeat the previous step for each track you want to move.\n\n*Save the file. (!)\nIf you've done everything correctly, when you open RhythmBox, the songs should be in the order you want.\nIf you haven't done everything correctly, RhythmBox may not be able to read the playlists file at all. It's a good thing you backed it up when you started all this, huh? You should be able to use the backup to figure out what you did wrong.\nThis procedure is certainly nowhere near as nice as being able to drag and drop the songs from the RhythmBox GUI itself, but it's better than not being able to change the order at all.\n\nA: I think you are looking at the music list, which doesn't allow drag and drop reordering. If you select all the songs and drag them to the \"Play Queue\" on the left hand side, then click on \"Play Queue\", you can then drag and drop the order of your songs.\nIf you want to save them as a playlist, add a new Playlist with the \"+\" at the bottom of the screen, and drag the songs there. If you click on the playlist name, you can also change the order with drag and drop.\n", "Q: How to apply an \"undocumented\" kernel patch I am unable to use the touchpad on my new GigaByte P35 v2.

Soon I will upgrade my GA-890GPA-UD3H to either GA-990FXA-UD3 or M5A99X (still deciding which one).\nWould I need to reinstall my 14.10 setup or will the kernel simply boot with a different motherboard driver?\nI am not upgrading the CPU, just the motherboard.\n\nA: If you replace an UEFI motherboard, you will need to add paths of your OS loaders to UEFI.\nIt can be done by efibootmgr utility. You will need to boot from Ubuntu LiveUSB, find your EFI partition and add the records.\nThe EFI partition can be easily found. It is a small fat32 partition, that has a boot flag in many cases.\nEFI loaders are files located at your EFI partition. Ubuntu has two loaders grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi. The latter is signed with Microsoft key to be able to boot with Secure Boot on. But in most cases either one works. You can safely add only shimx64.efi.\nThese loaders are located at /boot/EFI/ubuntu.\nSo to add a record to UEFI you will need to run\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \"\\EFI\\UBUNTU\\SHIMX64.EFI\" -L ubuntu -d /dev/sdX -p N\n\nwhere /dev/sdX is the disk where EFI partition is located and N the number of that partition. For example for /dev/sdb2 it will look this way\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \"\\EFI\\UBUNTU\\SHIMX64.EFI\" -L ubuntu -d /dev/sdb -p 2\n\n/dev/sda1 is default. If you have your EFI partition there, you can skip -d and -p parameters.\n-c parameter is to create an UEFI record.\n-l is a path to the loader in Windows format starting with \\EFI for some reason.\n-L is a label. You will see it in your bios as a boot option. You can change it to something else, but I am not sure that update-grub will not change it to ubuntu back.\nIf you run sudo efibootmgr -v, you will see all your records with paths and labels.\nYou can remove a wrongly added record by running\nsudo efibootmgr -Bb nnnn\n\nwhere nnnn is the record number.\nMore information regarding efibootmgr utility can be obtained by\nman efibootmgr\n\nYou can add records for other OSes like Windows the same way. But I can't give more details on what files and what paths they are located at.     \n\nA: You do not need to reinstall the operating system if you are upgrading the Motherboard, and if you are using an MBR-style boot environment (for EFI/UEFI boot systems, please refer to the other answer on this question).\nHOWEVER, you may need to go through and update some things afterwards:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, your drivers for your graphics card (if an integrated card) will need updated.  This is to make sure you have the right grahpics drivers for your graphics card.\n\n*Network settings for the ethernet adapter, if it's integrated, may need to be changed.  If your network and ethernet settings require to be set up statically, you may need to update your settings after changing the motherboard, because the ethernet card might get a new identifier (like eth1 instead of eth0 or something).\n\n*Drivers for any peripheral devices in expansion slots.  If your motherboard has slots on it which have additional devices (such as a separate graphics card, wireless adapter card, etc.) you may want to verify the drivers are installed and identified correctly.  Especially if there's new items installed.\n\n\nFor (1) and (3), you can likely run through the 'Additional Drivers' tool, which would then check your hardware and the non-free proprietary packaging sets to identify non-free drivers you may need to work with your computer.\nFor (2), you'll have to manually reconfigure your settings if they're a static configuration defined in /etc/network/interfaces, or configured manually in Network Manager.\n", "Q: Encfs mount problem After a couple of years of working perfectly I can no longer get access to my folders under Gnome Encfs Manager.

Can anyone help?\nThank you\n\nA: I'd eliminate the Gnome EncFS manager (not related to cryptkeeper) first. Try mounting the EncFS folder using the terminal & encfs directly, and verify that the mountpoint folder (exaple here ~/empty-mountpoint-folder) is actually empty beforehand (your error message sounds like the mount folder has some other files/folders in it, but I'm not familiar enough with it to blindly trust it):\nencfs ~/.encrypted-folder ~/empty-mountpoint-folder\n\nOr even using the -v verbose and -f foreground option to make sure \"any\n           warning/debug log messages will be displayed on standard error.

If it isn't, you won't even be able to log in.\n\n\n*This will work for your user only. For everyone else, your home directory will be whatever is stored in /etc/passwd. This means that, for example, cd ~user will fail. In other words, if I log in as bob and bob has the line HOME=/home/bob/foo in ~/.profile, then bob thinks that his home directory is /home/bob/foo but nobody else knows that:\n $ whoami\n bob\n $ echo $HOME\n /home/bob/foo\n $ cd ## this moves to your $HOME\n $ pwd\n /home/bob/foo\n\nSo far so good.

You do not want to anger your sysadmin for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.\n\nIn any case, it is rarely a good idea to mess with variables like $HOME, as it can often have unintended consequences.

He has 4 kids and wants to me to connect his desktop with their systems for monitoring purposes. What would be the best way for him to find anything they try to hide without needing their permission? It would be best if he could do this without needing to be on their devices. They all have Ubuntu, and I have seen this work on business systems.\n\nA: Monitoring file content\nAssuming you want to monitor file system content and the monitored system is a *nix, the simplest solution I can come up with, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the monitored system add a user account (e. g. dad) for the supervising party and add it to the administrator group (more):\nsudo adduser dad sudo\nsudo passwd dad\n\nThat way the supervisor account will be able to gain unlimited access to all system resources with sudo, including files of other all other local users. They can also impersonate other users and run applications in their stead to explore the user data stored by that application (e. g. the history of web browser, or the messages and contacts of an e-mail or other messaging client).\n\n*Still on the monitored system configure remote access for that account. The most common way for this would be an SSH server:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nsudo start ssh\n\nThe default configuration should be sufficient. For details look at the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki.\n\n*On the monitoring system, dad should now be able to log in to the monitored system (identified by either host name or IP address, e. g. child-pc) over the network with SSH:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client\nssh -X dad@child-pc\n\nThe option -X will forward windows created by graphical applications on the monitored system to the display of the monitoring system.\nAlternatively any SCP/SFTP client should be able to list directories and transfer files; e. g. Nautilus offers in the “File” menu the option to “Connect to server” of type “SSH”.\n\n*(Optionally, on the monitoring system) Since one should avoid to use password-based authentication over SSH, you can set up public key authentication.\n\n*(Optionally, on the monitored system) Revoke the administrative privileges of the monitored user account(s) (e. g. child):\nsudo usermod -G \"$(id -nG child | tr ' ' '\\n' | grep -vwF -e admin -e sudo | tr '\\n' , | head -c -1)\" child\n\nAttention: All remaining sessions/processes of child will remain part of the admin group and retain administrative privileges until logout/destruction.\nOtherwise child may lock out dad (which would be noticed and likely prevented by a non-technical policy) or subtly modify the system as to hide files in non-obvious ways. Of course that means that child may not install or remove packages or perform other system tasks without dad's help.\nAbout file encryption\nchild may try to encrypt their files, which cannot be prevented through technical means as long as they're still allowed to download and run programs. One can only prevent the use of transparent encryption systems like dm-crypt/LUKS, eCryptFS, or TrueCrypt, because they all need administrative privileges or a system policy allowing their use without this privilege.\nLast words\nAll that being said, a sufficiently apt user with physical access to a computer can always gain unlimited access and therefore lock out dad, modify the system as to hide compromising data from dad, or trick dad into a decoy environment without access to compromising data.\nAt this point things become more a question of trust than one of control. From a parenting point of view, I heard multiple people say: If a child is old enough to acquire the knowledge to circumvent parental control, they're old enough to be trusted to use their computer responsibly.\n", "Q: Is it necessary to donate to be able to download vlc media player for ubuntu 14.04?

I'm an idiot.\n\nA: Unfortunately CTRL+H only works in file managers and dialogues that support them, e. g. Nautilus. Most applications are sensible enough to use the file dialogue offered by the user interface toolkit they're based on (in this case GTK+, which has supported this keyboard shortcut for ages). I don't know what archive manager you're using there, but you should consider switching to one with a better™ user interface, e. g. GNOME's and Ubuntu's default File Roller.\nAlternatively you should be able to enter the name of (hidden) files and folders in the “Selection” field and press “OK“ or Enter to open or browse them in practically all file dialogues.\n", "Q: Copy-Paste from Mac to Emacs of ubuntu (* I have post the same question on AskDifferent, so far I have not got any answer yet, I guess here fits this question better *)\nI use version 10.9.2 of OS X and a virtual machine 6.0.5 VMware Fusion.

Is it too risky to be done?\nThanks for your suggestions\nOutput of sudo parted --list\nModel: ATA TOSHIBA MK5061GS (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system     Flags\n 1      32.3kB  109MB   109MB   primary   fat16           diag\n 2      109MB   21.1GB  21.0GB  primary   ntfs            boot\n 3      21.1GB  155GB   134GB   primary   ntfs\n 4      155GB   500GB   345GB   extended                  lba\n 5      155GB   409GB   253GB   logical   ntfs\n 6      445GB   474GB   29.1GB  logical   ext4\n 8      474GB   496GB   21.5GB  logical   ext4\n 7      496GB   500GB   4295MB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\n\nOutput of df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6        27G   25G  839M  97% /\nudev            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           392M  932K  391M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            2.0G   18M  1.9G   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sda5       236G  145G   92G  62% /media/DATA\n/dev/sda8        20G   18G  1.4G  93% /home\n\n\n\nA: No, your disk usage for your / does not include your home directory.\nHave you thought about putting your home in the empty space instead of sliding everything over?  Either way, GParted won't be able to move/resize a file system while it's mounted and being used.  You can use your Ubuntu live drive or disc for that if you've got one.  \nThe more direct route would be to boot friendly-recovery, and use parted to adjust your partition table, and then use resize2fs to adjust filesystems.\nAnyways, you now need to match your universally unique identifiers (UUID) for your changed filesystems (see by running 'sudo blkid') to your filesystem table entries in the file '/etc/fstab' .. notice the UUIDs, and mount points.\nNext, update your boot image with 'sudo update-initramfs -u', and then run 'sudo update-grub' to be able to boot that image.\n", "Q: Is /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc. supposed not to exist? I'm trying to connect to Amazon EC2 Ubuntu 14.04 instance through VNC but always fail (only grey background). Some articles say we should have a line in .vnc/xstartup which reads exec sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc But I checked this file and found that this file does not exist at all in EC2 Ubuntu. So if sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc is executed, there should be an error like \nsh: 0: Can't open  ...\n\nI guess that this is the reason why I can not display the desktop of EC2 ubuntu from TightVNC (I can successfully connect). So my question is: is /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc supposed not to exist? If so, what happens if the execution of sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc fails? If it should exist, what contents should this file contain?\n\nA: If you have the xinit package, the file you mention should be installed.\n$ dpkg -L xinit | grep xinitrc\n/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n$\n\nIf it's not, these commands ought to fix it:\nsudo apt-get purge xinit\nsudo apt-get install xinit\n\n", "Q: How to get back Dropbox Icon xubuntu 14.04 I am asking this because I was wondering this all day and all the existing answers about installing libappindicator1 and logging out and doing dropbox stop && dropbox start in the terminal were NOT working\n\nA: I have a netbook that I'm running a 32 bit installation of lubuntu on, and the dropbox icon works fine there...I figured I'd try to install another desktop environment to see if that would help. Apparently it's pretty easy, and this article does a good job of explaining it:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/193129/how-to-install-and-use-another-desktop-environment-on-linux/\nBasically, it's super easy to install another desktop environment and switch which one you want to load upon login. I decided I'd try lubuntu here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*install the desktop environment via terminal (you could use the software center too though)\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\n\n*after it was done, shut down the computer\n\n*boot into xubuntu. At the login screen, in the upper right next to the batter icon, there's a little xubuntu icon...click that, and it gives you a choice of what session to log in as. I didn't even know this, but apparently there's an 'xfce session' option and a 'xubuntu' session option....being curious, i clicked on the 'xfce session' option, and logged in....and voila! dropbox icon was back.\n\n*Now that the icon was back, I tried it for the regular 'xubuntu' login session and it works for that too. And of course it woks for the lubuntu sessions as well.\nSo that seemed to do it! hopefully it works for you guys too!\nI have also posted this on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2225969&page=2\n", "Q: Recursive display of remote desktop screen I tried to set up remote desktop to connect to an Amazon EC2 ubuntu instance.

I have a small network of computers,\nI am migrating from Arch Linux to Ubuntu's OpenStack Platform for usability reasons.\nThe reason I am asking is because of the following:\nInstalling Ubuntu OpenStack requires at least seven machines with two disks, two of which have two network interfaces (NICs). Install Ubuntu Server on one of the machines with two interfaces.\nI have two systems, one of which I can and hopefully will host six virtual machines and will form the cluster, and the other I am planning to be the cluster controller.\nI am having numerous issues meeting the prerequisites of using the ubuntu openstack platform, namely:\n\n*\n\n*Network Configuration and Setup\n\n\n*Actually, I don't know anything about OpenStack.\nCould someone give me a walkthrough on how to meet the requirements of this situation with the following resources:\n\nComputer 1 - The (Hopefully it works) Virtualised Cluster\nIntel Core i7 - 3770K.\n16GB of physical memory, 8GB virtual (swap).\n6+ KVM Virtual Machines (Presumably using all available resources).\nTwo NIC's.\nUbuntu Server as VM Host.\n\nNow is the controller.\n\nComputer 2 - OpenStack Controller\n4GB RAM and Swap\nTwo NIC's\nA new-ish Intel Pentium (The one a bit better than a late Core 2 Duo)\n\nI can't really afford any more systems as I am on a High School student's income, is there a way to make this work? I am not deleting my Arch partition until I know for sure. I am really limited by my systems and the documentation for the networking setup seems oddly scarce. Is anyone able to assist me on installation? Also, I don't know how to configure libvirt to allow me to network like this, will I need to host DHCP on one of my 'servers' or can I still rely on my good little Netgear router (DGND4000).\n\nA: There are multiple ways you can build and deploy OpenStack on Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*(easiest) use the OpenStack Autopilot. As you noticed, currently this requires 7 machines.  \n\n*Juju.  You can use Juju to deploy and configure OpenStack services. You need to install MAAS and Juju, but you do not need to know about OpenStack as much.\n\n*(hardest) Apt. follow the installation guide for Ubuntu on OpenStack.org, and build your configuration manually. You will need to learn quite a bit about OpenStack.\nAll three solutions require hardware, because OpenStack is infrastructure, and while it can be faked to test patches, OpenStack with almost no hardware is... hardly useful.\nIf you want to test OpenStack in the small scale, not for production, I recommend for now you use:\napt-get install openstack \n\nand try the single system cloud configuration you can build there. In alternative, you can try DevStack, which also gives you a (hardly realistic) cloud packed into one box.\nFinally, I hear the next beta of the OpenStack Autopilot may require less hardware resources for non-HA configurations. You may want to wait a few weeks until that's out and see if we managed to bring the bar low enough for you - you may still need a third machine, but that would be all.\n", "Q: Permissions on a messed up OS X hard drive I'm trying to help a mate recover some files from a failed hard drive from his Macbook Pro.

I have 5 devices connected to my home wifi. I need to know which device is using the maximum data(downloading or browsing). I have a 80 GB plan which get over within two weeks. can I know who might be downloading the maximum data?\ncan someone please help me on this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I only know of one way to really know - use a router that can log downloads & uploads by IP address (\"IP Traffic client monitoring\"). And it'd be helpful to assign the same IP address to each device with Static DHCP (assigns same IP by MAC address) or manually set IP addresses.\nIf your router doesn't log that info, you'll probably need to use custom firmware like OpenWrt, DD-WRT, Tomato... there's lots. Probably best to search by your router and see if any can work with it. And FYI, most are based on linux too, like Ubuntu is!\nI've used TomatoUSB for WRT54G-family routers (specifically the \"Toastman\" version), most don't seem to have been updated lately, but the routers they work on can be 5-10 years old. \nHere's a quote from the TomatoUSB page:\n\nTomato USB is an alternative Linux-based firmware for powering Broadcom-based ethernet routers. It is a modification of the famous Tomato firmware, with additional built-in support for USB port, wireless-N mode support, support for several newer router models, and various enhancements.\n\nAnd a little info about Toastman's version: (That's his avatar)\n\nUsing the QOS I was able to prevent uncontrolled P2P users bring down the router every few hours...\n  it allows the use of Tomato with up to 250 users. I use it in environments where we have no control at all over those users' PC's or what applications they may be using. Therefore, the QOS had to be very effective so that they could all share the same internet gateway without problems. \n\n[FYI, \"Quality of service (QoS) is the overall performance of a telephony or computer network, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network\" - Wikipedia]\nThe QOS can be used to limit the network usage of certain traffic (like P2P) so the network \"feels faster\" for other uses too.

Currently, my server (DigitalOcean) is using Ubuntu 14.04.1LTS with Apache 2.4.7.\nHow do I update Apache to the latest version?\nI tried apt-get to update the system but the Apache version is still same:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nI want to update Apache 2.4.7 to 2.4.11\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\n\nA: Apache 2.4.11 has yet to be released as a full package, as of today it's still in the development tree. That means you should check out and compile the source by yourself. As  a trade-off solution you could step up a few versions and get as much updated an Apache2 package as the Debian Apache2 team have released by adding these PPAs to your list of repositories:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php5\n(the second link goes for php 5.5 support)\nYou may follow these web page's instructions or go the easiest way by issuing these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5\n\nIf add-apt-repository is not available in your VPS, install it.\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nOr, on older Ubuntu versions:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\n", "Q: Use the design function of Qt Creator when developing Ubuntu apps I would like to start developing Ubuntu apps with Qt Creator and I have a few queries when making a simple qml qt app.\nFirstly, is it normal qml and javascript? Can I use all normal qml and javascript code that I would use in QT Creator for ubuntu apps?\nAlso, can I use the design tab of QT Creator to design the UI of an Ubuntu app? At the moment I get an error 'Errors while reading typeinfo files:', is there a problem with my install or can I not use design with an Ubuntu app with simple UI?\n\nA: I might be a bit late but yes you can use most normal QML.You should read the ubuntu api documentation for that.\n", "Q: Disk path changes from boot to boot I have a disk\nsudo lshw -C disk\n *-disk\n   description: ATA Disk\n   product: Corsair CSSD-F12\n   physical id: 0.0.0\n   bus info: scsi@7:0.0.0\n   logical name: /dev/sde\n   version: 2.0\n   serial: 10516505330003430015\n   size: 111GiB (120GB)\n   capabilities: gpt-1.00 partitioned partitioned:gpt\n   configuration: ansiversion=5 guid=21ec30ba-0aab-4ce9-be03-8f6f4de1afa1 sectorsize=512\n\nI've mounted it yesterday:\ncat /etc/fstab\n/dev/sdg1 /home/ssa/mnt/corsair ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nYesterday it had path /dev/sdg1 now it's /dev/sde and mount is not working.\nWhy name is changed after reboot?\n\nA: Such device names are not persistent, udev makes no guarantees that they will be the same. The Arch Wiki says: \n\nBecause udev loads all modules asynchronously, they are initialized in a different order. This can result in devices randomly switching names. A udev rule can be added to use static device names.\n\nYou should use labels or UUIDs instead. \nFirst, get the UUID:\nsudo blkid -o export /path/to/device | grep UUID\n\nThen use:\nUUID=... /path/to/mount/point type ...\n\nFor example:\n$ sudo blkid -o export /dev/sda3 | grep UUID\nUUID=d3504dc2-8f01-48f1-be05-d265110e2e73\n\nAnd the corresponding entry would be:\nUUID=d3504dc2-8f01-48f1-be05-d265110e2e73 /   ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu - multiple time zones displayed As I switched from Ubuntu to Xubuntu I missed the Date and Time indicator with the display of multiple time zones. This article suggested it can be done in Xubuntu, too, but how?\n\nA: I found three possibilities:\n1. Date and Time Indicator in the Indicator Plugin of the panel\n1. Install indicator-datetime from the Software Center or in the terminal sudo apt-get install indicator-datetime (it will install several other packages)\n2. Add the Indicator Plugin to the Panel (right-click on the panel and choose add new items) if not done before\n3. Right-click in the Indicator Plugin and choose Properties and hide “Keyboard” if necessary and wished\n4. I could not open the \"Date & Time Settings\" from the drop-down menu of the indicator. But you can set the timezones with the dconf-editor: Install the dconf-editor (Software Center or sudo apt-get install dconf-editor)\nDconf-editor: Select com > canonical > indicator > datetime\nLook at the locations field as shown in the first answer of this question and add your new location(s) - each entry is in the format ,'timezone city' i.e. separate entries with commas\nLook at the locations value.\n['UTC UTC', 'Asia/Nicosia Nicosia']\nYou can find the list of time zones here\n2. Orage\nIt's possible to display multiple timezones by using multiple applets of the Orage Clock Panel.\nRight click on the clock -> properties and in the clock dialog there is a button ('Time and Date Settings...') under the Timezone text-box. Clicking that button will bring up a dialog that allows you to select which timezone you want that applet to use. (You'll have to unlock this dialog by providing you password to edit it).\nEach applet will use the timezone you set it for. \n3. Orage and Global Time Window\nYou can sort of use Orage.\nMiddle click on orage in the panel and you'll get a new window Global Time - you can there set as many new timezones as you want.\n\nMiddle click to lose the global time window.  \nSo far I like the Date and Time Indicator the best as it also shows the calendar entries from Evolution and several time zones can be added without multiple time zones showing up in the panel what might be confusing.\n\nA: Easy answer: Use standard/regular XFCE panel Clock\n\n\n*\n\n*Add another regular Clock to the panel.\n\n*Go to Clock Properties (right-click or Panel Prefs -> Items -> Edit)\n\n*Change the Timezone to a new one (UTC, US/Central, start typing and options will drop down)\n\n\nTo have it display a message with the time, edit the \"Custom Format\" and add whatever you prefer. The code in the image shows the 24-hr time followed by a \"Z\", as in \"13:30 Z\". See XFCE's help (button there) for more info (or I think man date uses the same codes too).\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to quickly browse multiple pdfs in a directory? I often generate directories full of PDFs. I want to quickly flip through them as though they are pictures.\nNautilus will create thumbnails of the PDFs that I can enlarge using ctrl= but they never get large enough to see the detail that I want.\nIs there a better way?\n\nA: I like @Glutanimate answer since it uses a real pdf viewer. I have an alternative that allows viewing any list of files (including pdf) as a presentation, on fullscreen if needed:\nimpressive\n\n\n*\n\n*Install it\n\nsudo apt-get install impressive\n\n\n*Then, from a terminal in the directory containing your pdfs:\n\nimpressive -T0 -w *.pdf\n\n\n*It will display a presentation of your pdf files.\nthe -T0 option removes transitions (or, equivalently, -t None), and the -w wraps the presentation (you can return to 1st slide from the last one).\nYou may want to use the -f switch to avoid starting in fullscreen mode (anyway you can toggle to fullscreen hitting the \"f\" key).\nFor zooming, position your mouse where you want to zoom in, and hit \"z\".\nOtherwise I am just discovering the Zathura pdf reader, it's highly customizable, I suspect there might be a way to write a plugin and bind keys to switch to the next pdf.\n\nA: I recommend gnome-sushi, it's in the default repositories and works as you describe. After installing it, you just select the PDF in Nautilus and tap the space bar. Gnome-sushi will then display the PDF in a popup window at 100% zoom, which you can scroll through if you like.\nThe best thing is it also works on many other file types, so you can start playing a song, quick-preview an image, etc, with a tap of the space bar. Highly recommended for it's utility and one of those programs which I immediately install on any new machine.\n\nA: If you don't manage to find a better solution you could give this script a try:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME:         pdfwalker  \n# AUTHOR:       (c) 2014 Glutanimate <https://github.com/Glutanimate/>\n# DESCRIPTION:  Invoke one pdf file at a time\n# DEPENDENCIES: mupdf\n# LICENSE:      GNU GPLv3 (http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl-3.0.en.html)        \n\n############# Functions ###############\n\ngui_notify(){\n  notify-send -i application-pdf \"PDF Walker\" \"$1\"\n  echo \"$1\"\n}\n\narg_compose_filearray(){\n    # recursively add pdf files and folders in given arguments to array\n    unset Files\n    FileCountCurrent=\"1\"\n    while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' File; do\n        if [[ ! \"$(file -ib \"$File\")\" == *application/pdf* ]]\n          then\n              echo \"Error: '$File' is not a pdf file.

Can creating directories with 777 permission inside system directories cause any security weakness?\nFor example, say I open a directory called Custom inside /usr/share/backgrounds/ and give it 777 permission. Is it going to create any kind of security vulnerability?\n\nA: Your question needs to be answered with NO. For it to become an issue: someone first needs to gain access to your machine. If there is no way for someone to gain access exploiting it will be impossible. You do not mention having a web server active. You do not mention this machine being connected to the internet. So the answer is no.\nStill ...   WHY would you need 777 for a directory inside \"/usr/share/backgrounds/? There is absolutely NO reason for it. 775 is more than enough. \nAnd it should be noted that not using 777 is the better approach. Thing is... in 1/2 a years time you consider using a web server on your machine. Of course you totally forgot about doing setting a directory to 777 and oops it is inside your virtual host... \nIt would be rather easy to drop a script inside that directory that scans for files that contains the password to your MySQL server. \n", "Q: ASUS X550C wifi There is a lot of similar problems, but this one is a bit different.

So I downloaded firefox-34.0.5.tar.bz2 manually from Firefox's website, knowing full well that I could've used the Software Updater to update from Firefox 30 to 34.\nFirst, I searched for how to install the software from the tarball. Nothing worked. There were things like accessing README file, or INSTALL file but nothing worked\nI downloaded the file from their website. No way to install.\nNow, I used this guide from Libre-Software, which seemed trustworthy.\nHowever, when I click on the launcher icon, nothing opens. It glows red for two seconds, but then nothing.\nWhen I go to Terminal and type firefox-old because I backed up my current version to that file in /usr/bin, the old Firefox opens, which I'm using now.\nStill, the Terminal keeps saying stuff I don't understand.\n(process:6309): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed\nTypeError: external.getUnityObject is not a function\nTypeError: external.getUnityObject is not a function\nTypeError: external.getUnityObject is not a function\nTypeError: external.getUnityObject is not a function\nNo permission to use the keyboard API for http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net\n\nAlthough you can see what has happened if you open that guide, here's what I can make of the entire process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move extracted Firefox in /opt\n\n*Backup old app with sudo mv /usr/bin/firefox /usr/bin/firefox-old\n\n*Set up a symbolic link using sudo ln -s /opt/firefox34/firefox /usr/bin/firefox\nThis is really terrifying me and making me sick. Now, I don't want technical stuff, no symbolic links, no nothing. \nI just want a peaceful INSTALL of Firefox that will save my data (or not - I got sync). Simple, Android or Windows-like execution, a process bar showing the installation, and poof: brand-new Firefox 34 opening in front of my eyes.\nI want Ubuntu to remain the Linux for humans, so I would appreciate it if a little tweaking around (even command-based) can do the magic.\n\nA: Undo all the changes that you made and install Firefox using sudo apt-get install firefox. If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 this command will automatically upgrade your Firefox to version 34 which is the latest version.\n\nA: One thing you can do is back up your profile and then simply remove the manually installed Firefox 34. I don't know what steps you took to install Firefox manually, so I'm afraid I can't be much of a help with the removal step.\n\nStep 1: Back up your Firefox profile:\nFirst step you'll want to do is go into your .mozilla folder in the home directory. You may have to press Ctrl+H to show hidden files & folders:\n\nNext, go into firefox within the .mozilla folder:\n\nThe window that pops up should look similar to mine, albeit with only the Crash Reports and a ******.default (* = random numbers & letters used by Firefox) folder:\n\nCopy/paste all the files & folders to your desktop, we'll restore them later.\n\nStep 2: Remove current installation:\nOnce again, I don't know how exactly you installed Firefox manually, so I'm not going to be much help in this step.\nJust remove the current installation as best you can, making sure that you have a copy of the folders & file mentioned above.\n\nStep 3: Install via apt-get:\nYou should now be able to install Firefox from the official repository via apt-get.\nSimply run this in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox\n\nThis should install Firefox in working order for you and will provide you with automatic updates too! Now, this method won't necessarily give you the most up to date version of Firefox, but it should keep you pretty close if not on the current version.\n\nStep 4: Restore your profile:\nOnce you've installed Firefox you should be able to simply copy/paste those files you copied to your desktop earlier back to the ~/.mozilla/firefox directory. \nThe profiles.ini file is what tells Firefox what profile to look at for bookmarks and whatnot, so by backing it up we can simply replace the one that Firefox created when it was installed. This will make it so that Firefox looks at your profile from your previous installation and so you shouldn't lose anything!\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: GPG Key/File Naming Confusion When managing encryption keys in Ubuntu, I created a GPG key through the CLI with gpg --gen-key. Ubuntu provides a nice little GUI for managing keys called \"Passwords and Keys\". It however lists keys as PGP keys instead of GPG keys, under the GnuPG keys menu option as shown below:\n\nI have come to understand that GPG is not the same as PGP, but a completely rewritten piece of software that adheres to the OpenPGP standard that PGP also adheres to. So why does Ubuntu use the term PGP instead of GPG? Also, when using the the seahorse-nautilus package to encrypt files from within nautilus, my files come out with the .pgp extension rather than .gpg.\n\nA: Inconsistent Naming for Historical Reasons\nThis will very likely have historical reasons. In the beginning, there was only PGP, which was (for reasons of export restrictions) somewhat open sourced. Some time later, there has been an initiative to write down specifications, released as OpenPGP, and the Gnu Privacy Guard GnuPG was developed on that base.\nHaving the roots in PGP, lots of early PGP adaptors (having used PGP long before GnuPG was started) still use the term \"PGP\" referring to both usage and keys; not adapting the changed naming of implementation and underlying standard.\nLet's do Something About it\nEspecially in the free software world, one should put special attention on making a distinction between standards, implementations (and even more, non-free implementations); aside from PGP actually being a reserved trademark, probably without being licensed in this case. I created a bug report requesting more consistent naming in Seahorse.\n", "Q: Can't install shell themes I'm new to Ubuntu (14.04) and tried to install some fancy themes using shell extension, but I'm not able to install themes downloaded from the internet: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/r7l8g9657/\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/t73elw59z/Screenshot_from_2014_12_21_15_40_17.png\nThanks\n\nA: you have to enable the user themes under extensions in th gnome tweak tool.

This is a problem I had as well.  \nOnce you've got the files converted to .zip, you can navigate to them through gnome-tweak-tool or whichever tool you'd like to use.  [gnome-tweak-tool apparently doesn't like those filetypes other than zip.

The reason I decided to mention this is to explain the picture and get to the point faster with less questions as to why I have two network applets set to start in the picture. I kept the stock one in case I want to uninstall mate, which I most likely won't do. So, my question is, what do I need to disable to prevent the computer from going to sleep? I use an INSIGNIA HDTV I recently purchased near June or July, and if the PC goes to sleep, the TV says \"No Signal\" and then turns off after about 5 minutes? So, I have to use a remote to power it on, as if I move the mouse while the TV screen is off, nothing happens. I'm assuming the power manager does this, but I don't know what would happen if I turned it off. My PC is also hooked to my TV standard? (Not sure what you call it, but it isn't! DVI or HDMI) Any help?\n\nOther things hooked to the TV:\nNintendo Wii (and a shiny new PS4 I got for Christmas)\n(No TV signal is hooked to the TV at this moment.)\nAlso, I couldn't find this setting in the MATE desktop, but here's a screenshot of System Settings> Brightness & Lock.\nAlso, sorry about this but I forgot to add that this only happens in the MATE desktop, not the other two desktops.\n\n\nA: There are two settings you can work with:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings -> Brightness & Lock -> Turn screen off when inactive for\n\n*System Settings -> Power -> Suspend when inactive for\n\n\nThe first will signal the display to turn itself off, the second will put the computer into a sleep state. I'm assuming you're referring to the first behavior.\nThat being said, remember that TVs don't behave the same way that monitors do. A monitor will go to sleep (\"suspend\") and wake up when instructed to, but most TVs don't implement suspend mode: they will display a \"No Signal\" message for a few minutes and then turn off.\nYou'll need a computer monitor if you want display suspend functionality.\n\nA: Note: \nI installed Mate from tasksel onto Ubuntu server. Consequently, it is the only window manager installed without additional features from Gnome or Unity installed. \n\nPower management in Mate on Ubuntu:\n\nPower management is what you need to adjust to prevent your computer\n  from going to sleep. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On the menu bar, select system.\n  \n*Then select control center.\n  \n*Then in the hardware section, select screen saver.\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nScreen saver settings in Mate on Ubuntu: \n\nAnother point of interest is the screen saver.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On the menu bar, select system.\n  \n*Then select control center. \n  \n*In the personal section. select screen saver. \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*When Mate is the only window manager installed, Brightness and lock is not available and I am not sure it would even work in Mate.\n  \n*Many TVs will turn off to save power when it is not receiving a signal. This may or may not be adjustable on your TV, but it probably\n  does not need to be adjusted after configuring power management and\n  screen saver settings for Mate on Ubuntu. \n  \n*Screen-shots and instructions were performed on Ubuntu 15.10. If a procedure differs for other releases please add your comment so that I\n  can add an update.\n  \n\n", "Q: Chrome/Firefox slow to start in 14.04 It's been like that for months. Chrome and Firefox are just horribly slow to start. It can take 10 minutes before Chrome is usable. But after these 10 minutes, I can do whatever I want with it and it's fast. But that 10 minutes is just the worst.\nWith my machines at work, I never had such problem, only at home.\nWhat I've done so far:\n- Not restore my previous session (with 4-5 tabs opened), doesn't change anything\n- I checked \"top\" to monitor the CPU activity during that time, it never gets higher than 6-7%\n- Wait a bit after login in to actually start Chrome (maybe the slow part is happening somewhere else)\n- I installed a package (don't remember the name) that apparently helps booting frequently used app faster\nI asked that question before, and no one could help. And it was with previous version of Ubuntu (13.04). So that problem was not solved by upgrading.\nWhat can I do to help diagnose the problem? To give you more information so you guys can help me.\nThanks\n[EDIT]\nThe problem seems to be with Ubuntu itself and not the browser. When I boot my machine and go do something else for a while and then come back and login. The speed is okay. So that first 10 minutes, the problem is the OS. Also, everytime I first try to save a file (start downloading or save a new file from a text editor), it can take a while before the file dialog popup. But only the first time. It's like there's some bad stuff left somewhere that needs to be clean up before.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Usually Firefox problems are from some Add-on misbehaving, but it could be something else too. Here are a few things to try:\nSafe mode\nTo not load any add-ons you can try to restart in Safe Mode:\n\nTo activate Safe Mode, click the Firefox menu, point to Help, and select Restart with Add-ons Disabled. You can also enter Safe Mode by holding the Shift key while starting Firefox.\n... If Safe Mode works properly, the problem is with one of your add-ons. You may want to leave Safe Mode and disable add-ons one-by-one until you identify the add-on causing the problem.\n\nReset Firefox\n\nFirefox’s Reset feature will create a new profile folder, migrating\nover your bookmarks, browser history, saved passwords, cookies, and\nauto-fill information.\nYou will lose your extensions, themes, search engines, and\nsite-specific preferences when you reset Firefox.\nTo reset Firefox to its default state, open the Firefox menu, point to\nHelp, and select Troubleshooting Information.\nClick the Reset Firefox button.\n\nOther options\n\n*\n\n*Disable Hardware Acceleration (In Preferences/Options -> Advanced tab)\n\n\n*Update Software (plugins / extensions / firefox itself)\n\n\n*Check your computer’s RAM for errors (Memtest86+ from live cd/usb boot menu)\n\n\n*Finally, you could try disconnecting from your internet / nework before starting the browser.\nIt probably shouldn't help but it might. When Firefox starts up (especially if I've cleared the cache) it will try to connect to every site I have an opened tab for. It's NOT loading each tab (doesn't do that until a tab's clicked on), but it DOES try and download the site's \"favicon\" (little icon that goes on the tab bar / tab) and that could take a while. Disconnectng the network gives an instant \"can't connet\" signal and may speed up loading.\n[See this nice page with pictures for more info\n[These instructions work for Firefox 28 (the current version in Ubuntu trusty's repos)]\n\nA: Click the menu button and then click help \nFrom the Help menu choose Troubleshooting Information.\n\nIf you're unable to access the Help menu, type about:support in your address bar to bring up the Troubleshooting Information page.\n\nClick the Reset Firefox… button in the upper-right corner of the Troubleshooting Information page.\n\n\nTo continue, click Reset Firefox in the confirmation window that opens.\nFirefox will close and be reset. When it's done, a window will list the information that was imported.

Unfortunately, the shared libraries (drivers) are stored below /usr/lib64 and /usr/lib64/sane, but scanimage tries to load them from /usr/lib and /usr/lib/sane.\nSo, the solution is to copy or link these files to the proper directories \nln -s /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-brother* /usr/lib/sane\nln -s /usr/lib64/libbrscandec* /usr/lib\nln -s /usr/lib64/libbrcolm* /usr/lib\n\nThe 32 bit version doesn't have this problem, because the shared objects are stored in the correct location.\n\nA: The answer by Olaf Dietsche needs to be modified a bit for Mint 19.1 and Ubuntu 18.04.

In this case, it looks for libbrscandec3.so in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, /lib, and /usr/lib.\nHence, run these commands as root:\ncd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\nln -vs /usr/lib64/libbrscandec*.so* .\ncd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane\nln -vs /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-brother*.so* .\n\nThis should work for brscan3-based scanners. Other brscan versions may have slightly different library filenames; for brscan4, check the output of \ndpkg -L brscan4 | grep \\\\.so\n\nto see which library files are installed and need to be linked. For brscan4, the libbrscandec files are not need; for brscan2, libbrcolm2 is needed in addition to libbrscandec.\n\nA: To see result you ought to type in terminal next:\nscanimage -d brother3:net1:dev0 --resolution 150 --mode Color --format=tiff > /tmp/test.tif\n\nP.S.

So....my ISP has a data throttling policy between the hours of 3pm and midnight or at high data usage times. This is ruining my torrent download speeds. \nI'm still a newbie when it comes to Linux so be gentle but I have Googled around and seen that a VPN will mask my IP and should return the speeds to normal as the ISP can not determine location. Is this correct??\nAlso I only have a single machine and am wondering if it is even possible to set up a VPN with a single machine for free? \nAny other suggestions for avoiding throttling are greatly appreciated. \n\nA: *\n\n*A VPN will not mask your IP from your ISP.\n\n*One machine is enough for a VPN.\n\n*While free options are available, they are not always the best choices speed wise.\nPS: Why not torrent when there is no throttling?\n\nA: Are you sure your ISP is purposely throttling your internet speeds? Evenings are generally the busiest times for the internet, maybe everyone in your neighbourhood is just on at the same time?\nA VPN is supposed to hide your real IP from whatever remote sites you're connecting to. You need to connect to some remote VPN \"server,\" or you'd still be just connecting from your own IP.\nYour ISP probably knows where you live and installed the wire (or provided the wireless / cellular network equipment) you use to connect to the internet, you can't hide from them. \nBut an encrypted VPN might be able to hide what you're doing on the internet, so your ISP may not be able to instantly see that you're using torrent, or at least not exactly what you're downloading (in case you're worried about getting sued for sharing). The ISP might still throttle any high-bandwidth traffic, whether they recognize the P2P pattern or not.\n\nAfter reading your comment \"I have tried setting up a VM and downloading through it and although it did bypass the throttling it slowed my computer down to nearly unusable speeds\" it makes me wonder if the problem is really with your ISP\n", "Q: cant cd to a directory error while moving files to another directory I have written the following code to MOVE ALL THE TRACE FILES CREATED BEFORE 2 MINUTES TO A SEPARATE DIRECTORY.

(Maybe I'm just lucky ;))\nI recommend you to try Xubuntu or Lubuntu, they should run faster than Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Different install speeds on usb 3.0 usbs I got 2 usbs from Lexar both usb 3.0 one 32gb the other 64gb. I installed Ubuntu on the 32gb one and it was a fast install. On the other 64gb one it was the slowest ever and took 2 installs to get Ubuntu working. \nIs this normal or did I do something wrong with  the partitioning?\n\nA: I've been doing exactly this for a few years and like you, I too purchased Lexars only to find out they are over-rated, at least it appears I'm not the only amazon purchaser who has come to this conclusion.  They just aren't very good for speed, and even after retiring them I discovered other unexpected limitations to them.  Simply having a usb3.0 interface does not make for a fast device, but even among devices claiming speed like certain Lexars, the only guidelines you can depend on are respectable reviewers and your own benchmark testing.  If you don't mind wiping those usb flashdrives, you can use a utility built into Ubuntu's \"disk utility\" app to benchmark them, but they have to be completely wiped with no partitions on them at all before the benchmarker will work.\nBy contrast the Patriot brand, \"Supersonic Rage XT\" flashdrives are far better.  They are not the fastest I've tried, which I'll come back to later, but they are probably your best value in terms of money and speed.  Recently I purchased a special model of PNY which also claims exceptional speeds.  I've simply been too busy to run the benchmark.\nNow if you want REAL performance, here's what you do.  You purchase THIS external mSATA to USB3.0 adapter case and any size of mSATA drive you like.  Most such drives 6gb/sec transfer rates.  With this adapter you'll come close to the performance you'd see with them as internal.  I'm using one right now on this computer I'm writing to you from.  I swear to you, if you try this, you will experience performance you won't see on most gaming desktop computers.\nIn case you care to know, I'm using a 64gb msata in my case, but I could just as easily use one as large as 1tb.  Other advantages of this design is that if by any chance you bump your stick you can break the plug off and you are locked out but as this device uses a male to male adapter cable, the odds are highly against a cable bump leading you to being locked out.\nIs should also mention the dimensions as the ad omits it.  1.75\" wide, 3\" long, 5/16\" thick.\nIn case you wish to duplicate my success precisely, here's the exact 64g mSATA SSD I'm using, here's the link to the exact item.  Interesting, the price has fallen, making this method less than half again as expensive as purchasing the patriot I linked you to.  \nYou may also be intrigued by some of the clues about this project I've posted here on my user profile and on my linkedin page.  I'm hoping to one day dedicate some sort of web or perhaps Google plus community page to it as I personally feel it is the way to go for most people.  Having portable boot media like this is actually more practical than most people can imaging.  In some ways it is more practical than cloud computing in so much as it is not dependent upon internet connectivity.\n", "Q: grub recovery after partition deleted So after getting an error when trying to update my Ubuntu partition I decided to delete it and start over.

I want to write these part iso files into usb to create a bootable usb disk. How can I make a bootable usb disk using these part iso files? \n\nA: 1.First thing is merge three ISO files into one using ISO processing tools.\nGo to this link for how to merge http://www.ehow.com/how_8771531_combine-multiple-iso-files-one.html\n2.Then format your pen drive using NTFS format.\n3.Extract the single Merged file directly to the pend-rive using power ISO.\ni.e. select destination as your pend-rive while burning or extracting image file.\n\nA: Firstly, you need to join all ISO in a single ISO.

Even trying to reinstall python using sudo apt-get install --reinstall python did nothing.\nFinally,\nStep-1: I had to remove and install python again using:\nNote: Uninstalling python leads to removing many other dependencies which may break the installed Ubuntu, so be careful while uninstalling python\nsudo apt-get purge python\nsudo apt-get install python\nStep-2: Install the original package (in my case it was guake)\nsudo apt-get install guake\nThis installed all necessary dependencies.\nTry the same procedure w/ your packages and it should work for you too.\n\nA: I had similar problems with cups-filters on raspberrypi caused by realvnc-vnc-server. It was due to foomatic-filters being deprecated.

On theory it can be fixed by running apt-install pkg_name_here=older_specific_version_here. In my specific case that wasn't acceptable because i had many packages depending on the newer version of one of the nested dependencies which it wanted to remove along the downgrade, so i said no.\n\nA: I had a similar issue while trying to install another package.

I think the latter version of Ubuntu has native MTP support as I did not install any package by myself and I was able to do file manipulations after having the table auto mounted when I plugged it in(Samsung GT-8010 Galaxy Note). \nNow I think if it is possible to have MTP support on Ubuntu 12.04.5 32-bit using the repositories of the latest Ubuntu or something like that. I remember that I was able to get the support somehow on the previous version of Ubuntu but problems such as file transfer halting in the middle of the operation and not being able to execute/open files inside the tablet were present, thus I thought I did something wrong. I would appreciate it if someone could aid me in this process. Or should I just install Ubuntu 14.04 instead?\n\nA: \n14.04 has native MTP support\n\nCorrect. As of 13.04 to be exact. From the release notes:\ngvfs (1.15.2-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low\n\n  * debian/watch: Look for development releases, too.\n  * New upstream release:\n    - Add new MTP backend. In particular this can access Android 4.0 devices\n      which do not support the USB Mass Storage interface any more.\n      (LP: #903422)\n\n\nNow I think if it is possible to have MTP support on Ubuntu 12.04.5 32-bit using the repositories of the latest Ubuntu\n\nDuring 13.04 there was an upgrade path for 12.10 and 12.04. webupd8.org had a article on it. This was the way to get it into 12.04 but it might not work anymore ...\n\nUpgrade Gvfs in Ubuntu 12.10 and 12.04 to get Android 4.0 support for devices which don't support USB Mass Storage interface\nThe packages in this PPA may be unstable. Use the PPA at your own risk! There are instructions on how to revert the changes at the bottom of the post.\n\n*\n\n*To add the Gvfs (and libmtp) PPA created by the Gvfs MTP backend developer in Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10, use the following commands:\n\n\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp\n    sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n\n*Then, launch Software Updater (previously known as Update Manager) and install the available updates.\n\n\nMight be worth an attempt.\n\nOr should I just install Ubuntu 14.04 instead?\n\nYes, if there is nothing else holding you back that is I would myself have it upgraded to 14.04. There is an upgrade path for 12.04->14.04. This should be the easiest method: https://askubuntu.com/a/12910/15811\n", "Q: How to uninstall OpenCV 2.4.9 completely from Ubuntu?

After hibernate (suspend to disk) DRI will not work correctly. glxgears runs fine but playing games will hardlock. Workaround to prevent this is rebooting X. After suspend to RAM it works somehow but rebooting X is recommended.\n\nI think although it's already supported by the kernel driver, it's too old for Unity which requires good 3D support.\nS3 also provides Linux driver for this chip on their website, but it's really outdated and it reaches the end of support.\nI would suggest you to give Lubuntu or Xubuntu a try.

I know that it is impossible for my USB 2.0 drive. It stuck then when there is only 2~3Mo remaining. How to solve this problem?\n\nA: The copying is likely to be cached and/or buffered (in memory) which is why you see the high numbers.\nTo see \"real\" speed you would need to remove any caches and buffers, but the effect of it would probably be a slower than normal copy operation. To achieve this you need to mess with file system internals and system memory usage related to that.\nFlash memory needs to have a certain amount of data to write at a time for optimal/fastest possible speed. \nMORE INFO:\nCopy to USB memory stick really slow?\n", "Q: Allow users to set higher (lower?) nice levels I want to allow users to set a nicelevel lower than 0 (and any nice level really) in my system.

Or the gnome bars across the top and bottom? They make it very easy for the user to break out of the locked down environment.\nThank you.\n\nA: It does not sound like you want to use a full-blown Ubuntu with the Unity desktop environment for this. Generally speaking, there are many window managers that allow more precise control of input.\nIn case you are new to Linux and graphical environments: There are three aspects of how linux renders nice, high-resolution output - the X-Server, responsible for hardware interaction, the window manager (metacity in the case of unity), which offers ... well, the ability to manage windows (i.e. close programs, move windows, etc.) and, finally (and optionally) the Desktop Environment. This is what adds all the fancy buttons, taskbars, the clock, etc.\nIf you only want one window to run, you should probably look into more cut-down graphical solutions, especially because your use-case does not require a full-blown Desktop Environment in the first place.\nThis StackExchange article offers some further recommendations. You could, e.g. look into the program Sabayon, or, which may be more fitting, use the linux distribution Fedora, which offers a specific kiosk variant.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade to Firefox 34.0.5 on Ubuntu 14.04? I have Firefox 34.0 installed on a system running Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty).  Many websites want to inform me that my browser is outdated, as apparently 34.0.5 has some significant security updates.  Other major websites inform me that 34.0.5 should be available in the Ubuntu repositories as of about 4-Dec, but as of this date (21-Dec) even packages.ubuntu.com shows only 34.0, not 34.0.5.\nI'm reluctant to download an offline installer for 34.0.5 because I don't want to screw up my system by having two separate versions installed in two separate directories.\nI guess my question is: is there any good reason why 34.0.5 wouldn't be available from the standard Ubuntu repositories despite having been out for several weeks now?\n\nA: Apparently, Firefox 34.0.5 is the version that switched US users from Google to Yahoo search. (source here)\nFirefox in Ubuntu and derivatives is unaffected, but if you wish to switch the default search engine to something else, just change it in the search bar.\nPS: I can also confirm that Firefox 34 is not \"upgradeable\" to 34.0.5 on Windows, ...probably because I am not in the US.\n\nA: Currently, the best method seems to be downloading manually. On a 64-bit system:\nwget ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/34.0.5/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-34.0.5.tar.bz2\ntar -xjvf firefox-34.0.5.tar.bz2\nsudo mv firefox /opt/firefox34.0.5\nsudo ln -sf /opt/firefox34.0.5/firefox /usr/bin/firefox\n\nThis will only overwrite the symbolic link in /usr/bin, so there should be no conflict between the two installations. You can restore the link and use the old version with the following command:\nsudo ln -sf /usr/lib/firefox/firefox /usr/bin/firefox\n\nOr just run 34.0.5 without linking:\n/opt/firefox34.0.5/firefox\n\n\nA: The reason why Firefox 34.0.5 isn't on Trusty's repository is because Ubuntu versions are released in cycles and they release each Ubuntu version with packages that deem to be most stable to provide Long Time Support. So if I want to downgrade to Ubuntu 12.04, it will have all the older versions of packages that were provided with Ubuntu 12.04 at release.\nIf you wish to upgrade your firefox, you might have some issues with it due to it not being optimized for Ubuntu + Unity. For instance your toolmenu for Firefox will be hidden and not combine with the titlebar. Also adding non-official repositories can be dangerous since anything could be in there. So it would be your duty to see if the version of Firefox you're adding is secure as well being compatible with your desktop environment (Unity).\n", "Q: Alternative for |(pipe) operator I'm looking for a alternative for | operator in bash shell for redirecting output of command as input to the next command.

What to do?\n\nA: When using ecryptfs you'll have the same file appear twice (don't worry, it will only exists once).\nHowever, in your case, my guess is that only the file has been marked as deleted (e.g. moved to the trash bin), but not the container - where the file (really) lies.\nTo delete the container, too, start the terminal and navigate to the folder you deleted the folder in. Type\nls -lah\n\nand you'll probably see a folder that will have the same name as the other one, but starting with a \".\", and ending in _encfs. This is the folder you want to delete, which you can do with \nrm -rf <foldername>\n\nbut only AFTER you have unmounted the folder.\n", "Q: Brightness steps twice on one keypress I am having an issue on my HP Pavilion g7-1350dx laptop. Whenever I press the keyboard's brightness keys, I notice two things: the display brightens by two steps instead of one, and the Unity OSD displays a shift by two steps. The output of acpi_listen is as follows when I press each button once (first up, then down).\nvideo/brightnessup BRTUP 00000086 00000000\nvideo/brightnessdown BRTDN 00000087 00000000\n\nI have found no solution for this problem to date, however I will mention that this problem is nonexistent when not logged in. When I am idle at lightdm's login screen, pressing either of these buttons only adjusts brightness by one step.\nAs a side note, I am using fglrx-updates, the proprietary AMD driver for an AMD/ATI BeaverCreek Radeon HD 6520G. I have also looked into the system settings for a shortcut that gnome-settings-daemon uses for brightness, but I could find no such shortcut. I have also tried disabling Action Keys Mode in the BIOS settings, this hasn't worked either.\nAny insight or links to answered questions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Changing the brightness value in the /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness file can make the issue solved. Here the command:\necho {brightness_value} > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\nBrightness value must be between 0 to 20. I'm not sure whether it can vary device to device.\nYou could create a script and invoke it on shortcut key press.\nI found a reference. I'm pretty sure the marked answer in the following link can make your issue solved. Why does my Thinkpad brightness control skip steps?.\n", "Q: How to download video content off of Facebook with Ubuntu? How can I download and save videos on Facebook to a file only my computer?

Ubuntu 14.04lts with Perl 5.18.2. \nThis is a special case where Google did not help me. I do not want to turn off email  for all cron jobs, I have about 15 jobs in my crontab. I need to see the emails cron sends me if there are errors. \nThis one job is a special case for which I need a solution. I have a bash script in my crontab which calls a perl script which is setup to check for email every 5 minutes. (It is not possible for me to setup a full MTA.) If there is no email the script does not output anything to STDOUT or STDERR yet cron still sends me a blank email with the full path of the bash script in the subject. \n\n\n*\n\n*I want cron and the Perl script to send me email if the perl script finds email and processes it, including if there are errors. \n\n*I don't want cron to send me a blank email if there is no output from the Perl script because no email was found. The script runs every 5 minutes. \n\n\nAnyone have any ideas? \nEDIT: Confirmed. It was a stray newline that was my problem. Problem solved. Cron does not send an email if there is no output. Thank you! Your comment helped.\n\nA: It was a stray newline causing the blank email every 5 minutes. \nCron only sends an email if the cron job/program run has output. My output was a newline, which of course, I couldn't see in Alpine, but it was there. I found the newline that my program was printing and removed it. \nNow I design my cron programs to never output anything unless it gets past the parameter checking. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 halts on bcmwl-kernel-source(i386)?

On (e.g.) Xubuntu, when I run wmctrl -d, I can clearly see in the output which is the current workspace, and the screen's resolution (DG) on the workspace(s).\n0  - DG: 1024x600  VP: N/A  WA: 0,31 1024x569  1\n1  - DG: 1024x600  VP: N/A  WA: 0,31 1024x569  2\n2  - DG: 1024x600  VP: N/A  WA: 0,31 1024x569  3\n3  * DG: 1024x600  VP: 0,0  WA: 0,31 1024x569  4\n\nThe current workspace is marked with a *.\nOn Unity however, the output of wmctrl -d shows only one (very large) workspace, marked with a *, no matter which is the current \"workspace\", e.g.:\n0  * DG: 3360x2100  VP: 1680,0  WA: 65,24 1615x1026  N/A\n\n\nThe wmctrl -lG command\nfrom man wmctrl:\n-l:  List the windows being managed by the window manager.\n-G-: Include geometry information in the output of the -l action\nWhen I run wmctrl -lG on (e.g.) Xubuntu, with a mousepad window on each workspace:\n0x03400003  0 241  197  533  244  jacob-1001PX Untitled 1 - Mousepad\n0x03400197  1 299  222  533  244  jacob-1001PX Untitled 2 - Mousepad\n0x034001be  2 236  201  533  244  jacob-1001PX Untitled 3 - Mousepad\n0x034001e3  3 283  228  533  244  jacob-1001PX Untitled 4 - Mousepad\n\nThe information is quite understandable; from the second column, we know the workspace  the window is on, its position (x,y, column 3/4) and the size (x,y, column 5/6). The position is given in relation to the worspace it is located on.\nOn Unity however, it is quite a different story. When I have four workspaces and I open a gedit window on every one of them:\n0x03c03b81  0 468  -884 875  741  jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 1 - gedit\n0x03c03e74  0 369  164  1111 741  jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 2 - gedit\n0x03c03f8e  0 -1269 214  1111 741  jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 3 - gedit\n0x03c00085  0 -1376 -917 1111 741  jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 4 - gedit\n\nSome windows have negative coordinates, some (may) have coordintates that exceed my screen's resolution.\n\nA: Viewports versus workspaces\nAs pointed out in this answer, there is an essential difference between Compiz/Unity and other window managers.\nIf we look at Xubuntu (XFCE), all workspaces are stand alone spaces. All we need to know is the workspace a window is on, and the x and y coordinates. Basically, there is no matrix in which the workspaces are ordered, apart from the \"lineair\" order 1, 2, 3 etc.\nThis is different in Unity, where there is actually only one workspace. The (spanning) workspace is divided in a number of sections, called viewports. These viewports are arranged in rows and columns.\nThat way it is possible that one window is partially visible on all viewports:\n\nunlike workspaces:\n\n\nDifferences in the output of wmctrl -d and how to interpret\nTo understand the output of wmctrl -lG, we should understand its \"anatomy\":\n\n\n\n*\n\n*desktop number (first = 0)\n\n*current desktop mark (\"*\" if it is the current desktop (workspace), \"-\" if not)\n\n*desktop geometry (the size of the desktop x-y)\n\n*viewport position (position on the desktop; see Unity)\n\n*workarea geometry as (\"usable\" size of the desktop, minus panels etc.; first column is px from left/top)\n\n*name of the desktop (possibly containing multiple spaces)\n\n\nSince Unity only has one workspace, the output always shows a * on [2]. How do we know how the viewports are arranged and what is the current viewport? \nThe information is in VP: 1680,0 ([4]). Not simply as a viewport number, but as an x and y coordinate. These coordinates can be zero or x*the screen's resolution. To know how the viewports are set up, we will need to know the screen's reolution as well (with the help of xrandr). \nHow to find out:\n\n\n*\n\n*how many viewports are there currently and how are they arranged:\nLooking at the DG: 3360x2100 in the \"Unity\" example, and knowing that our screen's resolution is 1680x1050, we can conclude there are two columns of viewports (3360/1680) and two rows (2100/1050).\n\n*which is the current workspace:\nAn example\nThe screen has a resolution of 1680x1050. The viewport information sais VP: 1680,0. Cordinates are displayed as the left upper corner, So we are on the second column, first row.\n\n*where a window is located in an absolute sense:\nOnce we know which viewport is the current one, we can localize the windows, looking at their coordinates in the output of wmctrl -lG [3]:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*window - id\n\n*desktop number (on Unity: always 0 as pointed out)\n\n*window coordinates, from the perspective of the current viewport (x-y)\n\n*window size, from the perspective of the (w-h)\n\n*computer name\n\n*window name\nWe can simply locate the window, with the origin at the left top of the current viewport.\nBelow an example of a screen resolution of 1680x1050, viewports 2x2:\nwindow coordinates from the perspective of viewport 1\n\nwindow coordinates from the perspective of viewport 4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*which are the windows on the current workspace:\n\n\nWith the information above and the help of wmctrl -lG (the window coordinates, section [3]), quite simple:\nif \n\n\n*\n\n*a window's x-coordinate is between 0 and the screen's (horizontal) resolution, and\n\n*a window's y-coordinate is between 0 and the screen's (vertical) resolution\n\n\nthen a window is located on the current viewport.\n", "Q: GUI for packaging and uploading files to Launchpad as .deb Is there a GUI for packaging and uploading a file to the Ubuntu repository?\nNo command-line stuff with the setup.\n\nA: Yes, there is GUI for packaging.

When I apt-get install nano in a docker instance of ubuntu:trusty nano's display is seriously messed up, what do I need to do to fix this?\nI've tried vi/vim as well, and arrow keys are broken.\n\nIn the image above, for example, there are \"B\" characters scattered about... I'm SSHing to an Ubuntu 14.04LTS host, and connecting to the local docker on that host.  I'm guessing it's some terminal setting on the ubuntu host, or local, but it's irritating to say the least, and not sure where to start on this.\n\nA: I've since switched terminals to the Windows Terminal from the Windows Store on a more recent release of Windows 10 (Build 19042, but 20H2 should work).\nI'm also now using Docker Desktop with WSL2, which I wholly recommend..\nBetween these two changes, I rarely see any oddities now.\n", "Q: What does it mean when `ls` shows a numeric user id? I'm fairly new to the ubuntu system.

Having a numerical value instead of a username means that the user that owns the file no longer exists in the /etc/passwd file.\nIf you run cat /etc/passwd you'll see a list of all the user accounts on the system.\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh\nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh\n\nThe first integer is the UID, or the user's unique numerical identification.

I know this problem from Ubuntu 12.04.There I could change the grub but in 14.04 it's not working because the don't accept sudo gedit /etc/default/grub - the answer is:\nsudo: gedit: command not found\n\nany ideas what i could do? Thanks!!\n\nA: You need to install gedit first with:\nsudo apt-get install gedit\n\nThen you should be able to use:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nIdeally though, you should use gksudo or similar to run GUI stuff as root so bits of your home directory don't accidentally end up being owned by root. You can use a command line editor such as nano instead:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nTo use it simply edit stuff, then save with Ctrl+O and exit with  Ctrl+X. You may need to install it first with sudo apt-get install nano.\nAfter any apply changes, you should be able them by running sudo update-grub and rebooting.\n", "Q: How do I upgrade to the latest version I'm a neophyte user trying to set my system up to program in PhP via Ubuntu.

If the Ubuntu installer can't detect Windows 10, will it be detected at GRUB?\n\nA: Windows should be detected while you manually install Ubuntu 14.10 and added to GRUB. If it is not added initially, boot into Ubuntu, install Boot Repair and run that. That should add Windows 10 to your GRUB.\nSource: I have run a Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.10, elementary OS, Fedora quad boot\n\nA: I wasn't able to get the boot repair to work so I manually added a Windows 10 boot option.\nThe first step is to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom (using SUDO) and add the following lines to the bottom of the file:\nmenuentry 'Windows 10' {\nset root='(hd0,msdos1)'\nchainloader +1\n}\n\nIn this case my bootloader was in /dev/sda1 hence the 1 at the end of msdos.

That way, Windows will have an MBR, and it would show the other operating systems. Try that. \nI believe you have installed Ubuntu, so insert the Windows DVD and select repair -> cmd.\nNow enter,\nBootrec.exe /fixmbr\n\nThere are other commands too. You can try these out:\n/FixBoot - writes a boot sector onto system partition to start Windows\n\n/ScanOs - scans all disks for Windows installation and displays them.\n\n/RebuildBCD - scans all disks for Windows installations and prompts you to pick the ones you want to add to the BCD.\n\n\nA: Boot Ubuntu and mount your Windows partition (simply open the disk on Nautilus)\nRun the following on the command line: \nCtrlAltt:\nsudo os-prober\n\nIf your Windows installation was found, you can run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote that step 2 is just for your convenience.

I installed 12.04 32 bit. \nCan anyone explain how my operating system changed to change to Edubuntu? can this happen through some kind of system update?\n\nA: You installed edubuntu-desktop, which is a metapackage that installs the Edubuntu desktop and the packages it wants/need to work. This includes edubuntu-artwork, which installs plymouth-theme-edubuntu, the theme you see on boot.\nYou can remove this with:\nsudo apt-get remove plymouth-theme-edubuntu  \n\n\nA: Did you install edbuntu-desktop?

What should I do, my Ubuntu is a 64 bit. \n\nA: You only need to either open the Ubuntu Software Center and look for Firefox, or run sudo apt-get install firefox in a terminal.\nMost software that you'll need can be downloaded from a central repository, that you can search through the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: The answer of saiarcot895 is the safest one. However, it is possible you want a newer version of Firefox than the standard repositories of Ubuntu deliver. Make sure you have downloaded the right version of Firefox. This should be a .deb file. Right-click the file and select \"Open with Software Center\". Now you can install this program from the Software Center.

You can use a specific file extension that is supported.\nyoutube-dl --sleep-interval 30  -i -f mp3 URL_HERE\n\nyoutube dl will always try to download the best version.\nSee documentation for more information - https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#format-selection\n\nA: Are you really sure you want MP3? A lot of devices nowadays can play AAC and some can even play Opus.\nIf you want to retain highest quality (Opus 160 kbps) and your player supports Opus codec it's better to use:\nyoutube-dl -f 251 (Playlist URL)\n\nBut if your player only supports AAC (as most entry-level TVs in 2018):\nyoutube-dl -f 140 (Playlist URL)\n\nIf you use MP3 you'll get degraded quality as reencoding (from already reencoded audio by YouTube) will be required.\n\nA: Both parts of this question (downloading in mp3 and downloading a playlist) are supported by youtube-dl:\nyoutube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" <url to playlist>\n\nSome notes from me and the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Older versions of youtube-dl struggle with modern playlists. You might need to replace the repo version with the latest.\n\n*cmo: You can ignore missing (\"unavailable in your country\", or removed) videos with an -i flag.\n\n*frans: If your playlist isn't working and the URL contains a v=<ID> element, remove it so there's just the ?list=... item in the querystring.\n\nA: There are a lot of instructions you can find using your favorite search engine.

I have an \"old\" Tv card from TechniSat, the SkyStar 2 TV. I bought it a few years ago but it never worked on windows.. so now I wanna reuse it, has somebody experience with TV on ubuntu? What software should i use?\nAlso i want to know what specs the computet should have for full HD recording...\n\nA: Your best bet is to TRY TO use \"MythTV\" available for Ubuntu and easily installed directly from the GUI Ubuntu Software Center.  \nWhen I specify TRY TO, I'm referring to the fact that while it supports many popular TV tuner cards, it of course cannot support all of them.  In addition, there are some really nice such devices which have likely come so far from yours you may wish to invest in something different when you learn what all your options are.\nI especially want to take the time to warn you not to be misled by the name into installing MythBuntu.  It is not what it sounds like.  it is not a package for Ubuntu, but rather it is an all in one pre-integrated tv/tuner/dvr package preinstalled into Ubuntu.  In some ways it is ideal for people who want everything to work without having to learn as much about Ubuntu, but if you are on this site, the odds are you don't need it.  Of course if you have a couple spare hard drives laying around you can switch between for best result, you can try both.  I tried five hard drives when I was first getting started.\nA little more about MythTV.  It started out as a project to merely make a TV/DVR program for Linux because while many such cards existed, there simply wasn't such a thing as a tv card package for linux and that simply would not do.  The grandness of the scale of its features was never imagined at first, but with lots of interest, support and imagination it spread into one of the most fantastic programs I've ever read about.  It really deserves to be its own standalone operating system so I really understand why the mythbuntu version came into being.\n", "Q: Can i create image of my current installed ubuntu so that i can install it on other machine?

Please provide details. thanks\n\nA: I'd love to provide you with this answer, and particularly with details.  You see, there are two popular and equally correct answers, and I'm prepared to offer both to you, with the understanding that the one which sounds easier is much much more dangerous to your data, while the one which sounds slightly more complicated is immensely safer, while also being easier.  Given the choice I'm a big fan of both fast and easy.  Neither method is significantly slower than the other.\nAlso please see my bio and take my word for it that the program I use for cloning is in fact the slightly more complicated sounding solution.  So lets get started.\nThe solution I wish to recommend to you is CLONEZILLA\nClonezilla is a program which comes to you as a downloadable ISO which you burn to a cd and boot your computer to in order to operate it.  After several text menus, it gives you the stupid easy choice to back up your drive (or just partitions) to an image file on external usb media (in most cases) or directly to another drive entirely.  I recommend the image transition, if only because I'm fond of backups.  Using an intermediary takes longer, but I think it is worth it.\nThe other solution uses a utility built into Ubuntu called dd.  I have heard that dd official stands for data description, although it is commonly referred to as \"drive duplicator\" but that it's ambiguities which causes people to copy blank drives over full drivers resulting in Data Destruction.\n\nA: You can easily move any Linux installation by just moving its folder, as long as you don't alter the files or their rights. So it is 'tar caf /ubuntufolder archieve.xz' but there are difficulties:\n\n\n*\n\n*You MUST do the archieving while booted from LiveCD or another Linux installation OR exclude pseudofolders like '/proc' '/tmp' and whatever else. \n\n*After unpacking, you will have to reinstall bootloader and check '/etc/fstab'.\n\n\nA: You need a program that can produce an iso file, and this is Remastersys.\nThis set of instructions helped me install and run successfully remastersys on Ubuntu 14.04.1 32bit and also successfully make a bootable flash drive with the custom iso I made.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal (Press Ctrl+Alt+T) and run  \nsudo apt-get install plymouth-x11  \n\n\n*Go to this link and download remastersys version for 32bit or 64bit system \nIMPORTANT: I downloaded version 3.0.4-1 i386 and it WORKS\nI checked 3.0.2- version and it doesn't work.\n\n*Open 'Software & Updates' (search in Dash or in the System's parameters) \n\n*In 'Software & Updates', go to \"Other Software\" tab and press \"Add...\" button\n\n*Copy/paste this \ndeb http://www.remastersys.com/ubuntu precise main\n\nand press OK\n\n*Now look for two lines with \"www.remastersys.com/\" in the list you can find on the Other tab and make sure you check both boxes. Enter a password if you are asked to. \n\n*Switch back to Terminal and run \nsudo apt-get install remastersys-gui \n\n\n*To open remastersys-gui, you always need root privileges. So do it in the Terminal\ngksu remastersys-gui \n\n", "Q: How to end a cron started script? I start a script via cron which works fine. But when i then try to end that script via cron (either killall / pkill / pgrep does work) nothing happens.\nIf i let cron try to kill it or try it my own doesn't do a difference.\nThe only way to stop it seems to be htop and then F9 (sigterm).\nSo, How to end a cron-started script?\nMy scripts starts with #!bin/bash and cron starts it by ./path/script.sh.\nAny ideas ?\n\nA: What should work anyway is to kill it by its pid:\n\n\n*\n\n*run ps -ef (or ps -efww if the lines are too long to read the end)\n\n*find the scriptname, and you will have its pid\n\n*kill it with:\nkill <pid>\n\n(mind you: not pkill, which is to used as pkill <application>, not as pkill <pid>)\nNote:\nUsing the command:\nps -ef | grep testscript\n\nwill list two processes; the one you are looking for and the search process itself that you are running, e.g.:\njacob     4183  3647  0 11:22 pts/10   00:00:00 python3 /home/jacob/Bureaublad/testscript.py\njacob     4202  4189  0 11:22 pts/25   00:00:00 grep --color=auto testscript\n\nwhich means that you would have to use e.g.:\nps -ef | grep <scriptname> | grep -v grep\n> jacob     4183  3647  0 11:22 pts/10   00:00:00 python3 /home/jacob/Bureaublad/testscript.py\n\nTo only find the line you need.\nUnlike the pgrep command, that filters itself out of the list, as pointed out here: :\npgrep -f testscript\n> 4183\n\nThat means that using pgrep -f <scrptname>as suggested by @muru is the better way, for more than one reason.\n", "Q: unzip multiple files I don't think that I'm the only one with this problem, but unfortunately I wasn't able to find the proper answer between previously asked questions.\nIt is a very common procedure on torrent sites where the content is split in many small archives. Sometimes, those small indexed zip archives are containing another rar archives inside.\nSo, my question is: how to you handle this problem? How to you recursively unpack those files?\n\nA: To unzip multiple files using a loop -    \nfor z in *.zip; do unzip \"$z\"; done\n\n\nA: To do so, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Currently, MAAS installs an ephemeral image on the node, which in turn installs the actual OS using curtin. We are working on integrating snappy semantics in curtin, so that curtin is able to lay down a snappy image. That's why you don't see any snappy images available in MAAS.

It is your task, not the ISO's, to copy to the proper partiton. Additionally, if you just copy ISO to HDD into partition, you will need a manual and highly non-trivial installation of bootloader to start it. Even if you succeed, you will have a read-only installation, that keeps all files in memory and reverts to pristine condition on every reboot.\nWhat are you trying to achieve? \n\nA: During installation you can choose whether to install Ubuntu alongside Windows or you can make partitions by yourself.

Apache, MySQL, Chrome, Firefox are examples of those. \n", "Q: I'm ubuntu newbie, need help. on Dell 5537 I just got a new Dell 5537 i7 laptop with Ubuntu pre-installation on it. It's my first time to use Ubuntu system. I know may be my questions hav been asked before but frankly I tried to look them up and still I don\\t know how to put it right.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all I noticed that HDD folders and partitions are not as they are displayed on windows, that got me confused. But my main problem here is that I want the system files on a separate partition and my other data like movies, games,books and other files on another partition is it applicable? \n\n*I want to know how to find the correspondent to the device manager of windows ? cause I want to make sure that my VGA card driver is installed, because when I checked the system details I was written in front of Graphics : unknown.\n\n*Finally if you kindly refer me to any useful guides for users who switch from windows to Ubuntu, that would be great.\nMany thanks in advance\n\nA: Welcome to Ubuntu family.\n\n\n*\n\n*The answer to the first question, by default you have only one big partition installed (with a small swap partition which acts as a RAM supplement and a small /boot partition where the bootloader is present). I would personally suggest all your files to be put in your default folders because that would help search things faster and make the experience better. But, if you want a separate partition, refer to excerpts from this guide I have made sometime ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4FvxI6SUvM\n\n*There is no GUI based device manager alternative in Ubuntu because it is not needed. However, if you want to check whether you have all the drivers installed, just hit the super (windows) key and search for \"additional drivers\". It should scan for any drivers that are not installed during the installation process.\n\n*Unfortunately, we lack in terms of introduction videos. I am currently trying to solve this problem. You can look at this video I have made which can give you a rudimentary idea of how to use Ubuntu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5vU8Gz9UjA\n\nA: *\n\n*The file system of Ubuntu is totally different from Windows.\nThere is a root directory marked as /.\nAll other directories come out of this /.\nAll the partitions are held by root.One of these directories, supposedly a separate partition called /home is the place where your personal files are kept.\n\n\nPrograms and system configuration files are in other places. They aren't in your /home folder by default, so you don't have to bother with making system files and personal files separate - they are already separate.   \n\n\n*Most drivers come pre-installed with Ubuntu. Also go to system settings - Software and Updates - Proprietary Drivers to check if any other drivers are necessary.\n\n*http://www.tuxradar.com/linuxstarterpack\nhttp://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/index_main.html\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you can place your other data files on a separate partition. \n\n*According to Google, your laptop has Intel HD Graphics 4400 graphics. The driver for this and other Intel integrated graphics is built-in in Ubuntu. In order to confirm that your laptop has Intel HD Graphics 4400 graphics, run this command from the terminal to show your graphics processor details:\nlspci -vvnn | grep VGA  \n\nIf your laptop has a separate graphics card, the above command will also show the details for that graphics card. If your laptop has a separate NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, the built-in Additional Drivers utility will show you the available drivers for it, and you can also show the recommended proprietary graphics driver for your hardware by running the following command:\nubuntu-drivers devices\n\n\n*A good introductory guide to Ubuntu is the free PDF book: Getting Started with Ubuntu 14.04 written by the Ubuntu Manual Team.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Getting Started with Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*Getting Started with Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\n*The official Ubuntu documentation for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server is found

First off, I had to create a UEFI 3.0 USB stick for the WIN7 install because it would not recognize the SSD. I understand I could have changed that requirement in the BIOS so I would be booting into Legacy (MBR) format, but I went with the newer default settings. From what I've read so far, it seems that Ubuntu doesn't do an 'auto install' on a UEFI/GPT formatted disk, even though I am using a UEFI 3.0 USB ISO for that... it doesn't recognize the WIN7 OS, and I would need to manually format and install it, and then hope I can get the boot repaired afterwards.\nThis is what i want to do, and would like some feedback as to the best way to get it done: I want to install WIN7 and Ubuntu OS on the SSD  (half each), and split the HDD for each system to store its own data. I will mostly be using the PC for video editing, and may need both OS, depending on what software I end up using. Here are my questions:\n1) Is there enough of an advantage to using the UEFI/GPT partition/format scheme to be worth the trouble, as compared with doing the whole install in legacy/MBR mode? Will I lose much functionality or efficiency if I simply switch the bios to legacy and do everything that way, which seems to be much easier?\n2) depending on which way I go (UEFI vs Legacy), what would be the best way to format the drives for a seamless install of both OS. If I go with UEFI, would it be best to format one primary partition on each drive as NTFS, or just leave it all 'unformatted', or ????... and,\n3)what would be the best way to set up the drives for a clean install? maybe use Gpartd from the live USB Ubuntu stick to reformat everything, or ????\nI do have some data and apps on the WIN7 installation that i would like to save and restore after I have everything running properly. I plan on using half the HDD as the D:/ drive for all my data and some apps for WIN7, which will probably end up being a NTFS partition which will be accessible from Ubuntu, but not vice versa. I can live with that. The other half of the HDD would be Ubuntu data, and I suppose that would be my '/' partition... thanks in advance for all your help.\n\nA: If you have successfully installed Windows 7 with UEFI then everything should be in place. You would just need to boot the Ubuntu media the same way for installation and it should provide you the install alongside option.\n\n1) Will I lose much functionality or efficiency if I simply switch the bios to legacy and do everything that way, which seems to be much easier?\n\nIn theory UEFI is actually easier. This mostly depends on the firmware, some laptops have issue but desktop boards should be fine. A mix of connected GPT and MBR disks causes problems during Windows (re-)installation. Also with GPT the limitation of only up to 4 primary partitions is gone. The best thing of all: no more bootloaders overwriting each other! A broken Linux bootloader (configuration) doesn't result in a broken Windows and vice versa. UEFI is much more flexible.\n\n2) would it be best to format one primary partition on each drive as NTFS\n\nI don't understand. Why would you want to format a partition for Linux with NTFS before installing?\n\n3) what would be the best way to set up the drives for a clean install?\n\nIf you have installed Windows 7 properly in UEFI mode Ubuntu would just need to create a root partition and a swap partition, it would install it's bootloader to the existing EFI System Partition. If that is not the case and you don't see the install alongside option, we need to find out why.\n\nThe other half of the HDD would be Ubuntu data, and I suppose that would be my '/' partition\n\nI thought you were going to install Ubuntu to the SSD, so to use it for operating systems and the larger drive for data, or am I mistaken?\n", "Q: Cisco VPN not working although it says connected I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I am trying to connect to my university network via VPN.

I am a beginner in Linux.\nI tried to scan the open port of my computer but I found that only three ports are opened which is port 80, 53 and 65535.\nThen, I tried to scan my android mobile phone. It shown that all ports are closed.\nI used the following command:\nnmap -sT -p- (myip)\n\nIs it normal? Or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: It is normal that the port are closed if no service like ssh server or web server is opening them.\nIf you install openssh-server port 22 will be opened, if you install apache2 port 80 will be opened.\nIf you use ssh ( apt-get install openssh-client )\nor a webbrowser it will temporary open a random high port for the duration of the usage.\nPort 53 is dns.\nPort 80 is http, do\nnetstat -tlpen to see which process opens which port, especially the port 80 in your case.\nSince on your android phone you are not offering any services, only using them it is nornal that nmap shows no open ports.\nYou find the default port numbers in \n/etc/services\n\nA: The ports 0-1023 are called well known ports, they are registered with special services:\n22 ssh\n23 telnet\n25 smtp\n80 http\n143 imap\n443 https\nand so on, see /etc/services.\nThis is the server side waiting for a client to connect.\nThe client ( telnet, webbrowser, putty ...) will use a random high port (ports are 16 bit so 0- 65k ) for example 38743, it opens the connection by sending a tcp packet with set syn flag to the server.\nThat packet has the sender ip and port and the destination ip and port.\nThe server replies with a packet with ack flag set, and uses the clients packets sender ip and port as destination.\nSo if your Webbrowser opens connections to 2 different webservers it uses different random high ports for each server.\n", "Q: Can't write large files to flash drive I`m having a problem copying files to any USB flash drive formatted in FAT32. Small files copy ok. But if I try to copy a large file (say 1GB) it starts to copy, the progress bar continues to grow until very near the end and then stalls permanently. I waited more than 1/2 hour and the window was blocked. I tried to close it and nothing happend. If I kill the process, the copied file is corrupt. This happens to any flash drive I use. I tested the flash drive in other computer and the files copied correctly. Anyone knows something about this ?\n\nA: There can be a noticeable mismatch when files are being transferred to a USB device and their apparent progress as it's shown on-screen. If your USB drive has an indicator light, check that it has actually stopped flashing or otherwise indicates that the transfer is complete. \nOne way I've found to ensure large files are transferred is to use eject option for that drive. Your computer should verify and push any remaining data that is being transferred then indicate that it's safe to remove. Watch for the notice on your screen.\nHope that helps a little.\n", "Q: Can't ping most urls I am able to ping certain domains (like google.com, imgur.com), while most others I tried have 100% packet loss. For example, I can't ping dit.rs, b92.net, novosti.rs, they all have 100% packet loss. Additionally, I know I used to be able to ping those urls before (a couple of months back). Also, if I try to ping rts.rs I get:\nFrom dist-bg-2-te5-4.eunet.rs (194.247.195.138) icmp_seq=2 Packet filtered\n\nI don't know what this means. I'm freaking out because I'm afraid it might be a trojan or some other malware. Any help?\n\nA: As suggested by @muru and @ike, the reason why I wasn't getting response from pinging my urls was because my hosting company blocks pings. Here is their answer:\n\nUnfortunately, ping is not supported on our server. As you may be aware, Web servers come under attack by unscrupulous hackers from time to time. One of the attacks that hackers sometimes use is a Denial of Service attack, which is accomplished by sending millions of pings (routine system status requests) to a server over a short amount of time. This cripples the receiving machine, which spends all of its time responding to pings rather than doing its job like serving customer web pages.\nTo defend against these attacks, our server not return pings. The reports you are receiving from ping command do not reflect the availability of your Web site. Our server uptime levels have exceeded 99.999% over the past several months. In fact, it is in part because of our policy not to return pings that your Web site is performing as well as it is.\nMany ISPs are resorting to this kind of strategy in order to maintain the level of service expected by their legitimate users.\n\nI can only guess that the same reason is good for other pings not coming back.\n", "Q: Backlight issue on dell xps I just installed Ubuntu on my dell XPS and everything seems to work fine but the backlight that is constantly turn off. \nI've tried several options read through previous posts but none of those worked. I also tried to install Intel graphic drivers for Ubuntu 14 but no result as well. \nI am really not good at coding, do you have any suggestion?\nThanks a lot \n\nA: This could be a typical backlight control issue. As a workaround, you could edit the following file with:\nsudo vi /etc/default/grub\n(You could substitute the vi with any other editor that you're familiar with)\nPlease change the following line:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash video.use_native_backlight=1\"\n\nSave it and run sudo update-grub and reboot to make the change take effect.\nIf that's the case, your backlight control should work as expected now. \nIf you're interested, more information could be found in comment #5 of this bug. It's mainly caused by the BIOS and the Win8 capability. And for 3.16 kernel (which is the kernel of 14.10, it will use the native backlight control interface by default, therefore it won't have this kind of issue)\nLast but not the least, it would be great to open a bug against this issue with ubuntu-bug linux command.

Another oddity that the guest shows is that it is unable to shutdown after installing the spice-guest-tools.\nThis same question was already asked on Stack Overflow, which seems to be the wrong place for this type of questions.\n\nA: This problem is caused because the virtual USB hubs default to USB 1.1 - if you change it to USB 2 before launching the VM the camera should appear ok. But USB 3+ devices still cause problems. \n\nA: Check this link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1135488 , quote from there:\n\nThere are too many usb devices.  Four spice usb redirection slots. \n  One usb tablet.  Leaving only one usb port free, where qemu\n  automagically plugs in a usb hub to avoid running out of usb ports. \n  This is where the \"nec usb hub\" comes from.  And as the emulated usb\n  hub supports usb 1.1 only the webcam ends up on a slow port.  This is\n  where the speed mismatch comes from, which is root cause why the\n  webcam doesn't show up in the guest.\n\nThe solution could be: \nDelete a couple of the USB redirector devices,\n\nA: When using a USB redirector, devices such as a webcam, USB audio interface usually do not work correctly. Adding a webcam as a USB Host Device also won't help you. The only working solution I have found at the time of this answer is the use of an additional PCIe device that the webcam can be connected (PCIe card passthrough solution). Maybe an additional PCIe Gen3 x4 USB 3.2 card necessarily with IOMMU-support is right for you. Of course, a lot depends on the architecture of your system.\nYou will probably also encounter freezing of your guest machine. See TROUBLESHOOTING from this GUIDE, namely: My guest machine freezes consequently my USB audio interface crashing (for passthrough solution using an additional PCIe Gen3 x4 USB 3.2 card).\n", "Q: Dual Boot Windows and Ubuntu, Grub Problem I'm a linux novice trying to get a windows/ubuntu dual boot working. I can access both OSs ok, but only by navigating through a series of strange BIOS menus for Ubuntu (Windows boots automatically). Grub does not start initially, which is what I'm trying to fix.\nI've successfully partitioned my drive for Windows 7 Home Premium and Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. I have a HP-250 G1 laptop. \nI installed Windows first (on a 200 GB partition), then gave the rest of my drive to Ubuntu (500 Gb, ext4). I made partitions for swap (6500Mb) and biosgrub (1 Mb) when installing Ubuntu.\nWhen I start my laptop, Windows boots automatically, without giving any options for Ubuntu. The only way to boot Ubuntu is to restart the computer, open the Startup Menu,  go to Boot Device Options and choose ubuntu (TOSHIBA MQ01ABD075), which starts grub and allows me to boot into Ubuntu.\nI have tried using EasyBCD to get the Windows Bootloader to recognise Ubuntu, but I get an error along the lines of Failed to initialize properly. Annoyingly, the Windows Bootloader always pops up now, even if I delete the Ubuntu pointer.\nI have tried to use the Ubuntu Boot-Repair, the output was this http://paste.ubuntu.com/9604542/\nI tried entering the following command into an administrator command prompt bcdedit/set{bootmgr}path\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi as recommended by the boot-repair, but complains An unknown command was specified (EDIT)\nSo, long story short, I'd just like grub to start up when I boot up my laptop. Any help would be really appreciated!! \n\nA: I will try to answer my own question. Apologies if my use of technical terminology is wrong. Aim: To get Ubuntu to boot as default, and allow me to boot Windows by playing with BIOS.\nI believe the problem is the EFI on my machine does not allow me to boot from anything but /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi, see here for a discussion of this. The following is a work-around for users who mainly use Ubuntu, but sometimes want to boot into Windows. My expectation is that this is mainly of relevance to HP-users, from accounts on the internet.\n1) Install Windows, and then Ubuntu, see here\n2) Restart the computer. If windows automatically boots then try using efibootmgr to give Ubuntu precedence, see here. If this works, you're done so stop reading.\n3) If your computer is like mine, no matter what you do in efibootmgr, Windows will always force itself first. Changes you make will be undone when you restart the computer. In this case, the following hacks work for me.\n4) Restart your computer, quickly press esc and go into the Boot Manager. There should be an option to start Ubuntu, choose that and launch Ubuntu.\n5) Start a console and backup the important bootmgfw.efi to allow a boot to Windows\n$ sudo -s\n# cd /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n# cp bootmgfw.efi ./.. \n\n6) Create a new boot number, so we can boot up Windows in a hacky way by linking to the backup of bootmgfw.efi we just made. Run\n# efibootmgr -c -L \"Windows_2\" -l \"\\EFI\\Microsoft\\bootmgfw.efi\"\n# efibootmgr -v\n\nUse the last command to check the new entry was made. At this point I recommend you restart the PC and check booting into Windows_2 does indeed boot Windows. After you've done that, boot Ubuntu and cd back into /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n7) Renaming grubx64.efi to bootmgfw.efi allows us to boot Ubuntu first. Now enter the following commands:\n# cp ../../ubuntu/grubx64.efi .\n# cp bootmgfw.efi bootmgfw_backup.efi\n# rm bootmgfw.efi\n# cp grubx64.efi bootmgfw.efi\n\nThis should now work. Restart your machine.\nExpected behaviour: Upon booting the PC, grub should open up as the default, allowing you to launch Ubuntu. Trying to launch Windows from grub will just link you back to grub in a never-ending loop. To launch windows, you must restart the computer, quickly press esc and go into the Boot Manager. Select Windows_2 and that will launch windows.\nHacky but it works so far. I will update the post if it turns out this ruins my computer.\n", "Q: Multiple users logged in I'm looking at top and see that there are two users.

I know that the lower user is the one from my terminal (pts). How about the one above that? It's not even a tty, what is that \":0\" supposed to signify?\n\nA: :0 is the X11 display, if you have several screens or displays it will list them :0,:1, :2, etc...\n:0 is your desktop.\n\nA: :0 means that the user is logged through the X server. Thus there are two users because one is logged via terminal and other in the X server (GUI).\n\nA: This question has been answered here. To summarize it:\nFirst, there are no \"two users\" - there is one, who is logged in multiple times.\nAnd, as muru said, :0 normally refers to a log in via some graphical interface. Using \"w\" will tell you which interface logging into your system.\n", "Q: Cannot get my N300 (DWA-130) D-link wireless USB to work on Ubuntu 14.04 I'll start by saying i'm pretty new to linux, go easy on me!\nI've downloaded Ndiswrapper and tried installing the windows XP/Vista driver...\nBut iwconfig shows that there is no extensions..\nI've looked around on the site and found this \nwget -N -t 5 -T 10 https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qjc87hzk1z5x6z0/wireless_script && chmod +x wireless_script && ./wireless_script\n--2014-12-23 13:16:00--  https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qjc87hzk1z5x6z0/wireless_script\n\nwhich resulted in this log file: \nPlease help!!

For those you should be able to add new shortcuts with the generic name (or any name) you'd like. Or a \"personal\" section with just the apps you commonly used, named however you'd prefer (that's what I'd do).\nBut, since you clarified that \"I would like to change all the names to the generic names at once, not do them individually ... Each application has a generic name built-in to its .desktop file\" here's an answer to \"how to do that.\" \nThis uses some command line tools like grep & sed  to search for the \"Name=...\" part and replace it with the \"GernericName=...\" part.\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should use a local copy of the .desktop files by placing them in your ~/.local/share/applications/ first, with  \ncp -R --no-clobber -v /usr/share/applications/ ~/.local/share > ~/cp-applications.log\n(this may add more files than you want or need, but it writes a \"log\" to ~/cp-applications.log of what's been copied to where in case you want to undo it later) but leaving the original's alone, and not overwriting any local files already there. I'm also using sed's -i option to make a backup copy of the files too named *.BAK. And .\n\n*If you ever want to go back to the original versions of the .desktop files, you can overwrite the .desktop file with it's .desktop.BAK copy, or with the original from /usr/share/applications/.\n\n*If there are other .desktop files you'd like to play with, you could search everywhere for them if you like with find / -type f -name \"*.desktop\" (piped to less, or a file perhaps) but that will return more than you want.\n\n*And if you want the language-specific generic name just edit to hit that one (for example \"GenericName[en_GB]=\"). \n\n\nThis only changes the first occurrence of \"Name=\" (so it leaves things like Firefox's \"Open a New Window\" as-is):\n#!/bin/bash\ntargetdir=~/.local/share/applications/\n\nfor i in $(grep -l \"^GenericName=\" \"$targetdir\"/*.desktop)\ndo\n    echo Hit on $i\n    tmphit=$(sed -n 's/^GenericName=//p' \"$i\")\n    echo Generic name is:\"$tmphit\"\n    sed -iBAK \"0,/^Name=/s/^Name=.*/Name=$tmphit/g\" \"$i\" || echo \"SED FAILED!!!!\"\ndone\n\nThere's probably a way to do this with a one-liner in perl or even sed, awk, but \"meh\".\nFeel free to remove the echo's too.

(e.g. libcurl) I'd like to use libcurl (a lib that handles HTTP connections) by linking it statically to a program I am writing. I am new to building programs from their source, so I have no clue on how to do it (i'd like to avoid installing libcurl, so that not to mess with my system).\nSo here it is. I downloaded libcurl sources, and then I built them with ./configure && make && make test. Well I think I have built them, because the tests pass. And I actually downloaded the source for the whole curl software, so I guess I built more than the mere libcurl library.  \nNow, I am writing mysource.c :\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <curl/curl.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n  CURL *curl;\n  curl = curl_easy_init();\n  if(curl) {\n    // do something\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n\nSo, I brought all the include folder from the curl source near mysource.c, so that the preprocessor resolves the #include <curl/curl.h>. I suppose I should also bring the binary, built lib (like libcurl.o? libcurl.so? libcurl.a? something else?). But I can't find any file with such names in the curl folder/sub-folder. Where is it located?\nEven if I find it and bring it along my own sources, would using gcc -static -I... -L... -lcurl mysource.c work? How would gcc be able to understand the -lcurl flag then?\nMore generally (and the following question should work with all sources, not just curl/libcurl), when building from a source, where do the compiled and linked binaries go?  I know I should have my answer by reading the makefile, but it is thousands of lines long, and I really don't see the output dir for the built binaries anywhere.\nI know that, if I run make install as well, I should find them somewhere like /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib (and the corresponding .h files, if any, in /usr/local/include). But what happens if I don't wish to install the software I have just built? Can't I just grab the compiled files to use them?  \nThanks a lot\n\nA: The idea is the compiler turns .c file into .o, so-called object file. Next one uses ar to create a library, .a file that is supposed to contain several, hm, compiled C functions that one might reuse. Finally ld performs linkage, creating .so or ELF from specified  .o and .a files. Because of this needless complexity most compilers are also front-ends for ld and ar bintools.  \nTo override the path where compiler/linker searches for libraries, one uses --library-path=searchdir option. Though I am just answering the question, you dont need .a file really for statically linked ELF.   \nSo what module (.o file) you need to link with to use particular functions? Generally you should search what .c file has it, by default xyz.c file gets compiled into xyz.o so you'll need this.\n", "Q: How can I get my All.in.one Canon MG2520 scanner to work?

I'm the lead developer of an open source software called GDevelop (https://github.com/4ian/GD): I'd like to distribute it on Ubuntu and benefit from the Launchpad platform to get it automatically compiled for most recent Ubuntu versions.\nFor now, I distribute a .deb package that can be installed normally. The package is built \"manually\" using an home-made script calling dpkg. It works well but I can only build the software for a single version of Ubuntu (the one I'm using to develop the software) and it would obviously be better if GDevelop had a PPA, instead of asking users to go on GDevelop website to download the latest .deb file each time a new version is released.\nBut I struggle to build a source package: I've been reading this article https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/BuildingASourcePackage, but the link to the Ubuntu packaging guide is broken.

Build system is automagically guessed which is nice but it won't work if your software need additional parameters: you can override most arguments passed to packaging tools using the rule file.\nBuild dependencies should be listed in the control file. Real dependencies are then computed when built on Launchpad.\nFinally as you may have seen by looking at various tutorials/documentation, some files (compat, source/format) with esoteric content should be added ;) \n", "Q: Why qemu-system-x86 takes 100% of my CPU?

Happy holidays! \n\nA: You could try making this the main video card in BIOS. \nthe Acer monitor that is not detecting is connected to the video card through HDMI cable cord\nIt might make it detectable and hopefully the other monitor connected to the other card will work too. There is no harm in giving it a shot because if nothing loads, then you can always just switch it back to how it was before.\n\nA: *\n\n*Check if your video card driver is installed correctly, by going to system settings, updates, additional drivers.\n\n*Run Nvidia settings, when GUI opens check on the Nvidia gui how many monitors are detected, press on detect displays from within the gui and see if second display is detected.\nIf that don't work out,  check for driver or Linux software that can detect HDMI.\n\n", "Q: Why can't I interact with my ssh-agent?

Sl   00:05   0:00 gnome-keyring-daemon [...]\n\nWhat the hell is GNOME keyring doing on my KDE system? Shouldn't KDE wallet be my SSH agent here?\nThis leads to more questions than answers and I'm left with a non-functional ssh-agent.\nOn another system I don't observe this behaviour and I fail to find a configuration difference. Both have only KDE installed and the packages installed are nearly identical (managed by Puppet).\n\nA: NOTE: is not an answer solving the root issue. Please provide a new answer if you think you can solve the root cause. You really have to read on why my solution is just an ugly hack.\n\nHere's an explanation on what happens at boot time, identifying the culprit.\nUsing KDM (or LightDM) as log in manager, an X session is spawned for you upon logging in. The log in manager allows you to select an X session (e.g. GNOME, KDE Plasma, etc.) based on those available in your system. The directory /usr/share/xsessions contains the files for each of those desktop environment installed and your user specific choice is saved in ~/.dmrc.\nWhile the desktop environment loads after logging in, it loads all scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/. On a Kubuntu 14.04 system I see /etc/X11/Xsession.d/90x11-common_ssh-agent there by default, initialising an SSH agent. As expected. Great!\nIn practice however we see different things. Where does gnome-keyring-daemon come from then and why is the regular ssh-agent not started? Well, the GNOME keyring is started in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*XDG autostart, in /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\n*As an Upstart session job in /usr/share/upstart/sessions/gnome-keyring.conf\nAll scripts are first checking the environment values whether they will proceed. E.g.\n[ -z \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" ] || [ -z \"$GPG_AGENT_INFO\" ] || { stop; exit 0; }\n\nThis makes it a sort of race condition which SSH agent is actually started. First one wins. Brace for more nasty bits.\nHow come it works at one machine reliably and it doesn't reliably at another? The X session upstart jobs are only started when the DESKTOP_SESSION environment variable is whitelisted for it in /etc/upstart-xsessions, handled by /etc/X11/Xsession.d/00upstart. KDM allows one to set a Desktop environment 'Default' (default in ~/.dmrc), effectively kde-plasma, but not appearing kde-plasma.\nWith Session=kde-plasma:\n⟫ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION\nkde-plasma\n\nWith Session=default in a KDE Plasma desktop:\n⟫ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION\ndefault\n\nThis is plain wrong. And you can guess now why it fails the whitelist check against /etc/upstart-xsessions.\nQuick fix for running terminal session\nkillall gnome-keyring-daemon && eval `ssh-agent`\n\nConclusion\nIt appears that one can hit a bug with all Upstart session jobs not being started at all. Another bug prevents proper interfacing with the GNOME keyring SSH agent (or ssh-add should complain and fail). Oh I hate you, bugs.\nOnce I find time to do some research on what is exactly supposed to do what, I'll file the bug reports.\nFor now I decided to just 'use' the Upstart bug and prevent Upstart session jobs from running by setting Session=default. I'm not sure how much this breaks, but so far I haven't seen anything falling apart.\nThe root cause is the appearance of GNOME keyring in the first place and which should not lie to me and keep offering wrong keys.\n\nA: I always end up sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-keyring anyway, followed with a restart. ubuntu-sso depends on it but I don't use that, so no worries.\nssh-agent seems to just work as it should afterwards.\n\nA: I realize this is an old thread. I am using xubuntu 16.04.\nSeems the bug is still there.\nI installed seahorse to manage the keys and that worked.\n\nA: This is an older question, but I still ended up here looking for a solution.\nOne of the issues in my distro at least is that if you are using GDM, which is Gnome's Display Manager it doesn't care about KDE/Plasma at all and does nothing to make sure it is launched properly with all its configuration utilities.\nWhat you have to do for GDM at least is make sure you include PAM related settings.\nYou can do this two ways. You can install both and look at each set of configuration files and compare what is missing, or you can just give what I say a try. Going with looking at the config files will probably be the best bet into the future if things change, but either way things should be similar.\nFor the first file you need to edit it is /etc/pam.d/gdm-autologin\nInside this file you will need to add 1 line under @include common-session\nAdd this line under the gnome key ring line.\nsession optional        pam_kwallet5.so auto_start\n\nThe next file you need to edit is /etc/pam.d/gdm-password\nInside this file you need to add 1 line under @include common-auth\nAdd this line under the gnome key ring.so line.\nauth   optional         pam_kwallet5.so\n\nThat should take care of your login issues if you are using Plasma.\nYou could probably just include these things in some other way, but this is what worked for me on Ubuntu 22.04.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Sync issue with avconv I am screen casting and cannot get the audio and video to sync.

All was working fine until today my tv wouldn't produce any sound and HDMI wasn't an option under sound settings. I found a thread with somewhat similar issues and while trying to deal with my impatient family I ran the commands that were suggested before seeing the small comment under it stating it caused even more problems. The commands I ran can be found at the bottom of here: HDMI is not displayed in the \"Sound\" settings on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nThe only one i didn't do was  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade because I wanted to stay on 14.04LTS and wasn't sure what that command would put me on.

The power saving stuff sometimes make the detection not working.\nOne easy way to verify this is to forcibly (harmless, don't worry) play a sound with command-line commands, assign the output to the HDMI port even if it's not in your sound settings.\nFirst, connect your HDMI device and open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + t, run:\naplay -l\nYou should see a list of audio devices here:\n**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: HDMI [HDA Intel HDMI], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: HDMI [HDA Intel HDMI], device 7: HDMI 1 [HDMI 1]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: HDMI [HDA Intel HDMI], device 8: HDMI 2 [HDMI 2]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 1: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC290 Analog [ALC290 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nNext, play a sound and assign the output device to the HDMI:\naplay -D hdmi:HDMI,1 tmp.wav\nThe number \"1\" here is base on the output from the aplay -l command, so it could be 0, 1 or 2. And you can use another file to replace the tmp.wav here.\nThis should wake your HDMI audio device up, and it will now be available in the Sound settings.\nWorkaround\nIf this is the case, a workaround is to edit the config file with:\nsudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n(vi could be changed with any other editor that you're familiar with)\nAnd append the following line to it:\noptions snd-hda-intel power_save_controller=N \n\nAfter reboot, your HDMI audio detection should be working whenever the charger is plugged or not.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Run\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nto get the icons in system settings back.\n", "Q: mac nvram from ubuntu How can I read and write nvram values on a 2014 mac mini from ubuntu?  ie the equivalent of MacOS's nvram program.\nThe particular thing I am trying to set is SystemAudioVolume to get rid of the annoying chime, but I also want to change the boot order.\n\nA: nvramtool, but it seems that some settings are unaffected even when changing their value in nvram from ubuntu (SystemAudioVolume might be one).\n\nA: This is for disabeling startup sound, but same method should work with some other things too:\nReboot with an OSX installation disc or Recovery HD\nStart the Terminal\nIssue the command:\n/usr/sbin/nvram SystemAudioVolume=%01\n\n", "Q: Making Kubuntu start on command line How can I make Kubuntu (14.04) start (by default) on the command line and not in graphical mode?\nEvery post seems to deal with the reverse of this, namely that for some reason, *buntu starts on the command line and the user is trying to get it to start on graphical mode.\n\nA: Open a terminal (you can open a terminal using ctrl+alt+T)\nuse the following command\nsudo update-rc.d -f kdm remove\n\nIt will still boot and shutdown graphically but you can disables the splash screen in the grub using the following commands\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nremove \"quiet splash\" from the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= entry\nenter the following command to update your grub\nsudo update-grub2\n\nreboot\n", "Q: How to break login loop on ubuntu I changed the settings on ubuntu 14.04 so that I could log in without password.

On this, I have dual booted Ubuntu 14.10. Now, I want to triple boot with chromium os, but as I have a lot of stuff, I dont want to format or reinstall anything. Can someone help?\n\nA: This may be possible, but if your disk drive has an MS-DOS partition table, there is a limit on the number of partitions. If you have your HDD with GPT partition table it is possible to create more partitions (I don't know how many, but it is a large amount). This is the process I did to triple-boot Ubuntu, Windows 8.1 and Chromium OS with UEFI. \nI am supposing that you are able to create the two partitions that Chromium OS needs, and you have them somewhere (an USB drive, a disk image...). You need to create 2 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ROOT partition: I would give this one between 1.5 GiB and 3 GiB. This one only contains the system.\n\n*The STATE partition: This is where your data goes. I gave this one 9 GiB, but anything greater than 2 GiB should be fine.\n\n\nOnce you have created the partitions, you can copy them (using dd). Then you can fit the filesystem to the block device where they are. You can use the \"Check\" option in GParted or resize2fs.\nThe interesting part starts here, where you have to create the GRUB entry for Chromium OS. Under Ubuntu, edit the file /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add the following entry:\nmenuentry \"Chromium OS\" {\n     set root=(hd0,YOUR_ROOT_PARTITION_NUMBER)\n     linux /boot/vmlinuz init=/sbin/init boot=local rootwait ro noresume noswap loglevel=7 noinitrd console=tty2 quiet root=HDROOTA i915.modeset=1 cros_legacy cros_debug\n}\n\nYou must replace the \"YOUR_ROOT_PARTITION_NUMBER\" with the number of partition where your Chromium OS ROOT is. If you are using UEFI, you must also change \"cros_legacy\" with \"cros_efi\". Now you can create the grub.cfg file:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow we have to tell Chromium OS where the STATE partition is. By default it uses /dev/sdX1, where X is the disk where the ROOT partition is. To change it, edit the file /sbin/chromeos_startup, and change the number \"1\" of the line STATE_DEV=${ROOTDEV_TYPE}1 with the number of the STATE partition.\nReboot and enjoy your Chromium OS!\n", "Q: restore a hidden trash folder I have Ubuntu installed in one drive and another drive for data.\nUsing Nautilus I deleted a hidden folder in the data drive.\nThat hidden folder moved to Trash and will no longer restore.\nI cannot empty Trash either.\nAlso, Trash will only first show its contents when the data drive is mounted.\nHow can I restore the hidden folder to the data drive?, how can I restore Trash behaviour for this drive?\n\nA: You can try retrieving this hidden folder with the Terminal.\nA lot of people aren't aware that the Trash folder is actually located in their home folder.But we know,so we simply navigate there using cd:\ncd ~/.local/share/Trash/files\n\nNow we list the content of this directory with ls -la\nYou should now be able to see the contents of your Trash folder,including your lost hidden folder.With the next line, we copy this folder to ~/Save\ncp .<hiddenfolder_name> ~/Save/\n\nNote that \"~\" is like a shortcut to your home directory,it's in fact the same as /home/<user>/\nNow on the problem that the Trash folder only shows up when your data drive is mounted:\nI suspect that the data drive contains your /home/ folder, and seeing as the Trash folder is located in your home, it is not visible until your home folder is mounted.\nThe location of the Trash folder may vary on the huge variety of distros,you may have to look it up for your distro in case the one I named doesn't work for you.From the question itself I can't really tell wether your home folder is on the data drive, so if this isn't the case it would propably help to solve your problem if you could provide this info.

Find out how much space win8 requires. I have found that win7 uses 13-15 GB for a basic install, and that I need up to 30 GB for the programs that I use. So for me, 40 GB for win7 and 25 GB for Kubuntu is enough space for both OS's to live and grow. You can use the rest for data and swap. I put labels on the partitions so it is easier to know what is what later on (Linux_Data, Win_Data, My_Linux_Distro, etc.)\n\n\n*\n\n*for the size of the swap, there are alot of different schools of thought, but I always use a swap that is the same size of my ram + a little more (say 5 MB extra, that way you can suspend your sesion to ram)\n\n\n*Install windows first and point to the first partition during the instalation. After that, the partition formatted to NTFS for data will be recognized automatically by windows (again, this happens with win7. Don't know if it's the same with win8).\n\n*Install your Linux distro on it's (logical partition), that is, your mounting point for / should be the partition for Linux, and if you will have only 1 Linux distro installed, you could mount /home on the data partition that you formatted to ext4.\nNote: windows cannot read ext4 partitions.  \nTo sum up: 5 partitions (1 swap, 2 ext4 and 2 NTFS), 1 primary (for win8) and the rest logical.

I do apologize if I have missed some fundamental concepts asmy knowledge in networking is rather limited to small networks. My cluster, region controllers, dhcp, dns reside on the same ip: 10.0.0.1 connected via eth0. The Internet connected ip is 192.168.0.81 connected via wlan0. Both interfaces are added to the cluster interfaces and network (am I suppose to do this?)\nI tried to follow the guides but I still cannot resolve these problems\n1.)

I was correct about editing the cluster interfaces with the ifconfig from the machine that runs it. However, what I didn't know was that I have to forward the traffic from IPv4 to the internal LAN as well. In this case, I connect to the internet via wlan0 and my internal is connected via eth0. So, this is how I forward my traffic.\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -o wlan0 -i eth0 -s 10.0.0.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE\nsudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables.sav\n\nAdd this line into /etc/rc.local before exit 0 line\niptables-restore < /etc/iptables.sav\n\nEdit /etc/sysctl.conf (remove # from #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1) then\nsudo sh -c \"echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\"\n\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing\nNote: I'm still working on Etherwake problem.

As it takes less time for execution.?\n\nA: The answer is \"yes\". Initially, this is more of an assertion, since cat is merely reading the file, whereas the other two are scanning it for an expression. Your time scripts are the right idea, but at these extremely low durations, any small variance will give erroneous results.

Or shorewall (supports only IPv4, use shorewall6 for the IPv6) for a routing machine.  Setting up a firewall from scratch is complicated and prone to error.  Just set up one of the firewall tools shorewall or the simpler and less functional ufw and look at how they set up iptables and you'll see why.\nBoth are not that hard to set up correctly and secure.  Using iptable is much harder and demands knowleged about a lot of RFC:s, like RFC1918 for IPv4 and a lot more.\nThe firewall frontend shorewall is designed to be used in a firewall macine and your LAN and are quite easy to set up for that, at least compared to iptable. You only need to copy some files from /usr/share/doc/shorewall/examples/ to /etc/shorewall/, modify them and then run shorewall --check (if I remember right) to check the syntax and some semantics before start it.\nThe same with ufw, though it isn't designed for forwarding and NAT, just to protect servers and clients.  But for that, it's easy and very usefull.  You can set it up on a forwarding router, but then you need to manually add some iptable NAT rules so your machines in your local LAN can reach Internet through the router.  You also might want to add a DMZ for your public servers, and remember to always protect those servers with ufw, which ufw is designed for. Best to use a separate LAN on another ethernet interface on your router.\nDo try to avoid running extra servers on your routing machine, as it will possible open some more \"attack vectors\" against your router for hackers to use.  And use nmap from different machines to check your routers firewall, to see what is open from outside and from inside.\nBoth nmap and wireshark is essential tools for a router/firewall administrator.  Always check your settings.  An open router/firewall will be exploid very fast.\nDon't forget to look in the man pages for each command and package documentations in /usr/share/doc/package name/.\n", "Q: vgaswitcheroo: client 101 refused switch (Radeon HD5650/Intel Hybrid), can't use discrete graphics card I'm trying to use my discrete graphics card (Radeon HD 5650) so I can run some more graphics-intensive applications.

Screens which fade in and out do so slowly, and watching HD films results in a 'blocking' of fast moving video.\nI decided to visit the AMD page and I followed their instructions to install the Catalyst Control Centre.\nHaving done that I noticed no significant improvement in video performance.  I can run the Catalyst Control Centre, and I've played with some of the settings in there, all to no avail.\nWhen I go to Settings->Details->Overview the Graphics information is listed as \"VESA: 103\".  This leads me to suspect that perhaps the ATI proprietary graphics drivers are not being used, even though I installed them as per the instructions and catalyst control centre is working.  I tried to google VESA: 103 but I was not able to find any information which would help me understand what's going on.\nIs anyone able to help me come to an understanding about which drivers Ubuntu is using to control my graphics card?\n", "Q: Error Installing imtools Ubuntu 14.04 x64 When trying to install a tool for converting images to raw text format called imtools I get this error:\n/usr/bin/ld: trans.o: undefined reference to symbol 'cos@@GLIBC_2.2.5'\n//lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [imtool] Error 1\n\nI installed other required libraries like libjpeg but I can't resolve this error.\nMakefile code:\nobject = image.o jpeg.o main.o bmp.o edge.o png.o stats.o trans.o raw.o\n\nimtool:$(object)\n    cc -o imtool $(object) -ljpeg -lpng -lglut\njpeg.o: jpeg.h\nraw.o: raw.h\nimage.o: image.h\nmain.o: defs.h glx.h\nedge.o: edge.h\ntrans.o: trans.h\npng.o: png.h png.c\n    cc -c png.c -o png.o -g\nstats.o : stats.h\nbmp.o: \n.PHONY : clean\nclean:\n    rm *.o\n\n\nA: I edited the makefile as follows:\nobject = image.o jpeg.o main.o -lGL -lGLU bmp.o edge.o png.o stats.o trans.o -lm raw.o\n\nimtool:$(object)\n    cc -o imtool $(object) -ljpeg -lpng -lglut\njpeg.o: jpeg.h\nraw.o: raw.h\nimage.o: image.h\nmain.o: defs.h glx.h\nedge.o: edge.h\ntrans.o: trans.h\npng.o: png.h png.c\n    cc -c png.c -o png.o -g\nstats.o : stats.h\nbmp.o: \n.PHONY : clean\nclean:\n    rm *.o\n\nadded -lm -lGL -lGLU and it's working fine now :)\n", "Q: Edubuntu 14.04 - Custom PXE Boot setup Using VM, with Edubuntu 14.04\nI have just decided to update my PXE Boot server from 12.04 to 14.04 - I do not want to take the other system down to upgrade it.

In Windows (since at least XP, probably before), if you use the keyboard to move or resize a Window, you can get very precise locations and sizes – even more than with a mouse – by using the Ctrl key in combination with the arrow keys (after having invoked the Move or Resize functionality from the window menu [Alt+Space]) to move the window borders a pixel at a time.\nIs there a way to do the same (or a similar) thing in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Moving/resizing windows by 1px\nAssuming you are using Unity, the script below moves or resizes windows by 1 px. The script can be run with 8 different arguments. Depending on the move/re-size options you want to use, you can add the commands to a shortcut key combination. An overview of options and the corresponding commands below:\n\n\nExceptions/limitations\nThere are a few limitations:\n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-terminal windows can only be re-sized in steps. As a result increasing/decreasing the window size by 1px does not work with gnome-terminal.\n\n*The window to be moved/re-sized needs to be at least a few px from both the Unity launcher and the top panel.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*First install wmctrl, which is needed to get the window geometry and to move the window.\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*Create a directory ~/bin (so in your home directory)\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as move_window (no extension)\n\n*Make it executable (right-click on the file > Properties > Permissions (tab) , tick \"allow execute\")\nTo test, open a terminal window and run subsequently:\nmove_window l\nmove_window r\nmove_window u\nmove_window d\n\nSince the terminal window is the front-most, it should move 1px to the left/right/up/down.\n(As mentioned, resizing does not work with gnome-terminal)\n\n*If it works correctly, add the commands to shortcut keys;\nchoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the commands to four different shortcut key combinations. That might be tricky, since the commands you mentioned are probably occupied. What worked on my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift+Ctrl+arrow key left\n\n*Shift+Ctrl+arrow key right\n\n*Shift+Ctrl+arrow key up\n\n*Shift+Ctrl+arrow key down\nfor the move actions.\nFor the resize actions you'll have to try additional combinations.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n# calibration\ncal = 4\n# direction, as argument from user input (l, r, u, d / h+, h-, v+, v-)\ndirection = sys.argv[1]\n# move step size \nmv = -1 if  direction in [\"l\", \"d\", \"h-\", \"v-\"] else 1\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\\\n           .decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef execute(command):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n# find the top shift (height of the panel = resolution - working area)\nres_output = get(\"xrandr\").split(); idf = res_output.index(\"current\")\nres = (int(res_output[idf+1]), int(res_output[idf+3].replace(\",\", \"\")))[-1]\ntopshift = int(res) - int(get(\"wmctrl -d\").split()[8].split(\"x\")[-1])+cal\n# find frontmost window\ndef get_windowid():\n    cmd = \"xprop -root\"\n    frontmost = [l for l in get(cmd).splitlines() if\\\n                 \"ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0].split()[-1]\n    return frontmost[:2]+\"0\"+frontmost[2:]\n# get window geometry, create move command\nset_w = [w.split()[0:6] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lG\").splitlines()\\\n          if get_windowid() in w][0]\nset_w[0] = \"wmctrl -ir \"+set_w[0]+\" -e 0\"\nset_w.pop(1)\n\nif direction in [\"l\", \"r\"]:\n    set_w[1] = str(int(set_w[1])+mv); set_w[2] = str(int(set_w[2])-topshift)  \nelif direction in [\"u\", \"d\"]:\n    set_w[2] = str(int(set_w[2])-topshift-mv) \nelif direction in [\"v-\", \"v+\"]:\n    set_w[2] = str(int(set_w[2])-topshift); set_w[4] = str(int(set_w[4])+mv)\nelif direction in [\"h-\", \"h+\"]:\n    set_w[2] = str(int(set_w[2])-topshift); set_w[3] = str(int(set_w[3])+mv)\n\nexecute((\",\").join(set_w))\n\nNote\nThere is a little difference in the way wmctrl reports the window geometry, and the way wmctrl sets the window geometry. In the first case it calculates from the full screen (resolution), in the second case only from the working area (??). Even then, The script had to \"calibrate\" 4 px vertically, for which I found no satisfying explanation. The good news is that on different computers, I saw no difference in the deviation.\nIf in your case the window makes unexpected jumps, leave a comment.\n\nExplanation\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*The front-most window is looked up with the help of xprop:\nxprop -root\n\nSomewhere in the (extensive) output, there is a line like:\n_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW): window id # 0x4600a8d\n\nfrom which our window-id can be parsed: 0x4600a8d.\nSince the format is a bit different from wmctrl, we need to add a zero on the third position: 0x04200085\n\n*The window id is used to look up the window and its current geometry data, in the output of wmctrl -lG. Once we have the correct line, the data we have on the window looks like:\n0x04200085  0 322  52   823  998  <computer_name> <window_name> \n\nwhere column 2, 3, 4, 5 are subsequently:\n\n\n*\n\n*x coordinate of the top left corner of the window\n\n*y coordinate\n\n*width of the window\n\n*height of the window\n\n\n*by manipulating these figures, we can move/resize the window with the command:\n(example to move the window to the right by 1 px, changing \"322\" into \"323\")\nwmctrl -ir 0x04200085 -e 0,323,52,823,998\n\nThere are a few complications to deal with, but that is basically how it works.\n\nA: Apparently that doesn't work in XFCE either. I have an indirect idea that might work though...\nI'd suggest trying Accessibility options for controlling the mouse with the keyboard, setting it to move very slowly, and use that to get the window to move a little bit at a time.\nEach desktop seems to put the Accessibility options somewhere different, in XFCE it's under the general Settings Manager, but it shouldn't be hard to find in Unity & others...\n", "Q: How do you effectively use the 'script' command to record an interactive shell? I have been looking at this reference and trying to work out how to actually use the 'script' command. Can someone give me an example usage? All I've been able to do so far is create a blank text file eg script myChosenFileName, but it records nothing.\nA bit more info:\nI want to record all the output from my translations in an interactive shell for future reference. An example command to open this would be trans -I {de=en}\nI am sure that this would be an easy question for someone with more CLI experience than me. (I feel a bit silly having the reference right in front of me and still not managing...)\nThanks!\n\nA: While the script manpage has no example usage, the related scriptreplay manpage does have one:\n% script -t 2> timingfile\nScript started, file is typescript\n% ls\n<etc, etc>\n% exit\nScript done, file is typescript\n% scriptreplay timingfile\n\nEssentially, script is run once at the beginning of the session, with an optional filename (if none given, the default is called typescript). The problem with script is that it's an exact copy of everything that happens, so if you try to view the file directly, you will have problems (which is why the scriptreplay command is useful - or you could simply cat the file).\nFor your purposes, it might be better, if more verbose, to use a command like tee:\ntrans .. | tee some-file\n\n", "Q: Forwarding ports with iptables not working?

I have decided to switch to Windows. I would like to completely remove ubuntu, and all the other files on my computer. How do I do this? I basically want to wipe my computer clean. \n\nA: formatting does not delete the data, you need to write data to the drive. Boot a live CD and either write zeros to the hard drive with dd or use a utility such as shread\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda iflag=nocache oflag=direct bs=4096\n\nor use a utility such as scrub\nscrub /dev/sda\n\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/1/scrub\nSee Securely erase hard drive using the Disk Utility\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Securely_wipe_disk\nYou then format the hard drive and install your os of choice\n\nA: That would be reformatting the drive.  You can probably do this automatically when installing windows.  Otherwise, you can also use a utility program do do it ahead of time.  You could boot an OS from a live DVD, to get a running OS without having your harddisk mounted, and then use a disk utility from that live DVD's OS to nuke the the disk.  Better make sure you don't have any data.\n\nA: You could try to run a live CD of any OS, like the Ubuntu one and use the Disk Manager to \"format\" the partition again.\n\nA: If all you're after is clearing the existing data so it won't interfere with a clean install of Windows, creating a new partition table and partitions along with formatting the partitions is sufficient; Windows installers at least up through 7 would do this automatically if you answer the prompts that way.\nIf you're concerned about ensuring data on the existing partitions can't be retrieved, you need to use a \"data shredder\" or \"mil-spec erase\" utility; in my experience, these are often bootable Live CDs with a limited Linux OS and (often auto-running) utilities tailored specifically to erasing data.  I have one called \"Boot and Nuke\" that boots from CD and erases all hard disks attached to the system with a secure erase.  Due to the nature of secure erase (overwriting all of the data surface of the device, many times, with patterns and random data) this process takes a long time (overnight, at least, with modern terabyte class drives).\nUnless you're trying to remove evidence of a crime (doing so is a crime in itself!) or national security related data, this is probably an unnecessary length.  For most purposes, it's quite sufficient to boot from the Windows media and tell the Windows installer that you want to erase the hard disk and partition it from scratch.\n\nA: Simply boot from the Windows installation media and follow the prompts to use the entire drive for your new installation.\n\nA: I will help you to wipe your hard drive such that it is completely indistuishable from a new hard drive.  Asking us how to reinstall Windows is \"off topic\" for this site.  Please rephrase your question to omit that aspect of your request.\nThe super simple way to wipe your hard drive to like new status (no partitions at all), is to boot your computer to literally any ubuntu Live Boot boot (media) CD/usb-flash.  It doesn't have to be remotely up to date, so whatever you installed ubuntu with should be more than adequate.\nOnce your computer is booted to a live boot CD you merely open one program already on the live boot media.  It is called Disk Utility, and it will do exactly what you want to do with absolutely no thinking or grief.  You don't even have to open terminal!

I do not believe that VNC or Team Viewer is appropriate because I am not looking for a desktop sharing solution. I think that I need some sort of remote X terminal solution, but I can't find how to set something like that up. \nThis is what I am looking for:\nLocal host: Windows 7\nRemote host: Ubuntu 14.04LTS Server (headless)\nI am looking for something that works similarly to Windows RDP.\nI want to be able to connect to the remote and have a login screen show up which requires me to enter my network user id and password, or my user id and password on the remote computer. I do not believe VNC works because it appears to require a global password to be configured for access to the remote. If a second person wants to connect, they should be required to enter their own user id and password.\nI found a document for Multiseat X configuration. This is close to what I want, but that appears to apply to allowing multiple concurrent logins to a local machine rather than multiple concurrent logins to a remote machine. I don't know enough about Linux or specifically Ubuntu to port the multiseat configuration to a remote machine.\nI am willing to consider VNC or TeamViewer if someone can show me how to configure them for multiple concurrent remote seats.

I think the specifications are: Turion 64 X2 @ 1.8 GHz processor, 2 GB RAM, GeForce Go 6150 graphics card, and a 160 GB hard drive.\nI have tried installing this operating system three times now. I've tried both with having the installer install the updates, as well as without updates. No matter what I do, it installs fine, but then freezes up as soon as I log in.\nI have done so much googling about this issue, but can't find anything that's helped me resolve it. I found a few posts talking about Nvidia driver issues, and about running sudo apt-get install nvidia-current and so on. I tried that before and it somehow just got even more broken and mangled, and wouldn't even boot up anymore, so I had to reinstall Ubuntu yet again. Now I can't even try that anymore. I did a fresh boot, and as usual it freezes up when I log in. But now I can't even access the terminal to try anything - pressing Ctrl+Fn+F2 at the login screen just takes me to a black screen with a \"_\" character drawn in the top-left corner, but I can't type anything.\nWhat am I supposed to do? How do I get this to work?\nI don't have a lot of experience with Linux, but it's always intrigued me and I was excited to play with Ubuntu, so this is really disappointing. This is the third time I have attempted to use Linux in my life (with different distros and computers), and it never, ever, ever works. It's so incredibly frustrating to just keep trying the same thing over and over and have it never work. I was really hoping that I could give this old laptop a \"new lease of life\" as they say, due to Linux running better on weaker hardware than Windows.

It used to have a partition for Ubuntu 13.10 which acted up, so I formatted it as NTFS in GParted. Then, in Windows 7, I used AOMEI Partition Assistant to merge the two partitions together so that I could have more disk space for Windows 7. When I rebooted the system, I got stuck at a grub rescue prompt which luckily I was able to fix. Then, when I opened up GParted to shrink my ext4 Xubuntu partition (to give more space to Windows 7), it gave me an error saying \"Invalid partition table - recursive partition on /dev/sda\" and it showed the entire disk as unallocated space.\nWhere did I go wrong, and how can I fix this?\n\nA: I've seen a few partition edits go wrong and fixed them (without loss of data) a couple of way, but I had still backed up all data first just in case, even though it turned out I didn't need the backup.  That said, I've never seen gparted go that far wrong.  I can only imagine that there was a power interruption while it was working.\nI will make a few suggestions, each with a link, none of which are remotely guaranteed to work, though I'm confident that what some of them reveal may help us all to help solve this.\nI would first recommend you boot your computer to any live boot CD and open the included disk utility.  The odds are your hard drive will again appear unformatted with unallocated space, but it is always the first thing I do when things look weird.  It's like I want a second opinion just in case one program is acting wonky.  In general, gparted works great, but a lifetime of experience has taught me never to assume that any one person or program is correct.\nThe next thing I'd try is the near-miracle repair disk.  It makes a bootable cd which you first boot your computer to and then use the utility within to analyze your hard drive's boot issues. It is primarily made to fix problems with the grub, but I've seen it perform unexpected miracles.  It is possible that in searching for bootable partitions, it will recognize the messed up partition table and restore it.  Personally I doubt it will help, but it probably won't hurt anything.  When it offers you a url for further diagnostics, please record it and post it here in case any of us can decipher it.  \nI will now list the utility most likely to help you.  It is called Test Disk.  While I like that it claims to run under everything, I dislike that it appears to need a working operating system to work, which seems stupid.  I would run it under one of my live booting usb flash drives, personally, but most people aren't using those.  I personally think this product would benefit more people if they offered it as an ISO image download from which we could make a self-booting cd or flash drive in the same manner we currently employ the boot repair CD.  \n", "Q: XML info for my computer installing Hadoop I'm new to this.

I know there are similar questions, but the only one with an answer is 5 years old and the answer is outdated.\nI just bought a new laptop, they don't come with VGA inputs anymore (at least the newest ones). So, in order to use my external monitor I bought a VGA - USB adapter (J5Create JUA210 USB Display Adapter). I'm in desperate need of making it work with KDE-Ubuntu.

The manufacturer of this product openly supports LINUX for other devices they sell, but not for this one.  In other words, it is extremely unlikely this device will ever be supported for linux.  If you do as much research as I have, you will also learn that fewer than 1 in 20 such devices are linux compatible, and those that are can be quite expensive.\nMy advice to you is that unless your VGA monitor is extremely large or valuable, that  you purchase a new monitor with an HDMI input, as it is very likely that unless your laptop is in fact a tiny little netbook or something, it actually does have an HDMI output port on it.  In case you don't know what HDMI looks like, it looks very much like a USB port.\nIf you would do us the courtesy of giving us the model number of your laptop, I'm sure one of us can find the time to determine the actually connectivity of your laptop, such as whether it has HDMI or perhaps some other sort of video connector such as \"displayport\".\n\nA: Alternatively you can ask support to share driver sources ... it is obviously old matters and j5Create will have the chance to go for such help. Then a community will be able to add some new (really old) drivers to the workarounds.\n", "Q: No success getting Intel AC 7260 wireless to work I recently purchased an Asus 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop.

It did not, and I have Ubuntu permanently installed, alongside windows 8.1, but my wireless does not work whatsoever.

I then copied the .ucode file in that package to /lib/firmware/ and I can see it listed there, along with other firmware packages\nHowever, when I open the /etc/ modules file in vi I only saw lp and rtc listed. So I added iwlwifi to the file also (i don't know if this did anything or even that is ok). Therefore, I have the firmware package installed - i think! - but I do not believe I have the driver installed correctly (or if I even need it in addition to that firmware package in lib/firmware).\nAgain, I have been working on this issue for almost a week straight, and I have hit a stand still on my own.

Most people who answer insist that windows will happily delete the content of your hard drive without further intervention by linux, and in the past I've known that to be the case, but considering the rate at which people like you seem to be asking, it only makes sense that I at least cater to you with the easiest and fastest solution I've proposed to anyone.  As I'm not certain the question I answered earlier today is going to get deleted, I'm just going to repost my answer here.\nThe super simple way to wipe your hard drive to like new status (no partitions at all), is to boot your computer to literally any ubuntu Live Boot boot (media) CD/usb-flash.

I started installing Ubuntu by watching a video tutorial about doing a disk partition installation, for that, inside Windows' 7 own disk partitioning tool. After a defrag I cut 100GB that I pretended to use on my Ubuntu installation for a little try out, now, while installing, I never really chose where I wanted Ubuntu to be installed, so I guess it just made a partition by itself of the minimum that the installation tells you it needs.\nHow can I now give the other 92 GB I had left apart only for that task?\nHere's what my partitions look like now. \n\nHere's a df:\n\nAnd here's the GParted tool un ubuntu:\n\n\nA: 1st option:\nSee if you can use gparted to delete the 92 GB partition, given that nothing is in it. Then expand the Ubuntu partition into the empty space. Moving files in gparted can be risky for your ubuntu install, but if you haven't customized it out yet, then it should be no big risk because it does not take long to reinstall.  You might not be able to do all of this from within Ubuntu.  If that is the case you could just burn gparted to a disk and boot from that.  Be very careful not to delete the wrong partition though.    \n2nd option:\nFrom Windows, delete both the extra partition and Ubuntu partition or merge the two.  Then reinstall Ubuntu.  Only this time select \"Do something else.\"  I believe it also says 'Advanced.'  Then it will take you to a menu with the partitions.  At that point you can select the correct partition (or create it) and format it to install there.\n3rd option:\nYou may want to use the 92 GB partition as a Data partition between Windows and Ubuntu. If that is the case, then you could just keep it and make it mount at startup. You would need to format it so Windows can access it (maybe NTFS).\nYou would add this command to startup items in Ubuntu:\n/usr/bin/udisks --mount /dev/sda7\n(Replace '7' with partition number.)\nThrough all of this just make sure you know which partition is which.  I am not certain what these partitions are because I just see what Windows says (7.93 GB partition and 92.06 GB partition).\n\nA: Here is a good article on what has happened here with the partitioning.https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Installation_Guide/s2-partitions-overview-extended-x86.htmlIf you are happy with having 85 GB free in your Ubuntu partition, then I would just leave it as is.If you would like more space in your Ubuntu partition, then you would want to use a program like Defraggler to defragment Windows. You will want to use Defraggler because Windows puts some unmovable files at the end of its partition, and Defraggler will move them. Then you would be able to shrink Windows, sda2, to a smaller size. (Only do this from within Windows.)  Then by using gparted you would expand sda3 into the empty space.\n\nA: EDIT: This stands here only for educational purposes.\nUbuntu does not allow messing with mounted partitions, therefore you have three options:\n\n\n*\n  \n*(Preferred one) Use 91GB partition for your /home, ie, user files. This way, when you need to upgrade Ubuntu, this partition will not be touched, ie, you will not have to copy data from backup back to hard assuming everything went right.\n     \n*\n        \n*Boot into Ubuntu\n        \n*Open terminal by pressing ctr+alt+T\n        \n*Gain administrative rights by typing sudo -s; it will ask for your password; there will be no indication that you are typing it - just type and press Enter\n        \n*Type lsblk\n        \n*Find your 91GB partition; Check if it's mounted; if MOUNTPOINT column is empty, skip next step\n        \n*Unmount that partition by typing umount /dev/sda[number from the first column]\n        \n*Change mount point of 91GB partition\n          \n*\n            \n*Get UUID for 91GB partition blkid; check for same /dev/sdaX as you used for umount\n            \n*Backup before messing with system file: cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_backup\n            \n*Type gedit /etc/fstab\n            \n*There should be line starting with UUID=[UUID from blkid];  change column /something to /home\n            \n*Save file\n            \n*Only read following if there was no line with correct UUID\n            \n*At the end of the file add line #mount home partition; # marks everything following it as a comment, so you can use whatever\n            \n*Add another line UUID=[UUID from blkid]  /home ext4  nodev,nosuid  0  2\n            \n*Save file\n          \n        \n        \n*Reboot\n        \n*You should have 91GB for your home directory; check from file manager\n     \n  \n*Deleting 91GB partition and expanding main Ubuntu partition from live session\n    \n*\n      \n*Boot into Ubuntu live session\n      \n*Open Gparted by pressing super (Windows) key, typing gparted and pressing enter;\n      \n*Select your 91GB partition\n      \n*Press Delete\n      \n*Select your Ubuntu partition\n      \n*From menu bar Partition -> Resize/Move\n      \n*Triple check the operations that will be executed (they are shown at the bottom)\n      \n*Check if the operations are such: delete [91GB] partition; expand [Ubuntu] partition; Edit -> Clear all operations if not\n      \n*Apply changes by pressing ctrl+Enter\n      \n*Reboot into normal Ubuntu session\n    \n  \n  \n*Deleting 91GB partition in Windows and expand Ubuntu partition. I am not sure to do this as windows does not understand ext4 formatting.\n\n\nCheck\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35807/how-to-harmonize-your-dual-boot-setup-for-windows-and-ubuntu/\nand\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116742/how-to-create-a-separate-home-partition-after-installing-ubuntu/\nfor reference.\n\nA: Maybe I missed something, but according to your screencap your root partition is 91gigs. If you created it to be 100gigs,some of it gets used elsewhere. \nI made a 100 gig partition for my Ubuntu and it only 90 something when all said and done. \nIf you don't mind reinstall Ubuntu, go back to Windows and delete all the non Windows/recovery partitions. Once the partitions are deleted it will show as unallocated space. Do NOT format. Leave unallocated. \nReboot to install Ubuntu, choose option to install along side Windows. Ubuntu will install to the unallocated space. \nBut again, if your partition was made to be 100 gigs, your only really going to get 90 something out of it \nEdit: I see what I missed. I thought that second partition of 7g was a recover partition. \nRemove the two partitions show they show as unallocated space and then like I said before reboot and install. \nYou could also try to merge the two partitions using GParted, but you will need to do it from a live cd/USB  environment so none of the portions are mounted.... Now that I think about it, I would try that first\n\nEdit: Took a closer look: \nThis is an odd one, as now that I look again, Ubuntu is on sda5 as its mount point is / and it has an ext4 file system. This can be confirmed by your      \n df-h \n\nAs it shows /dev/sda5 has a mount mount of / and it is 91 gigs\nSo your Windows appears to be \n     sda1 (system reserved) \n     sda2 is your actual c: drive.\n     /dev/sda5 is your Ubuntu\n     /dev/sda6 is your swap.\nThe 100 gig partition is /dev/sda3 and is extended. I'm starting to think there is nothing here. Im not sure if it is safe to delete that partition as /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 seems to be a sub partition of the extended partition.\nYou may need to back things up, redo your partition table as I previously suggested and start again. Sorry.\n", "Q: How to recover a completely messed up ubuntu system I have a system about 3000km away, so I have no access to it. The machine is running ubuntu 13.04 (yes, it's EOL passed long ago), and the python module is completely messed up. when I tried to use do-release-upgrade to upgrade it to 13.10 and then 14.04 (as explained here) I got this error message:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/do-release-upgrade\", line 8, in <module>\n    from DistUpgrade.DistUpgradeVersion import VERSION\nImportError: No module named DistUpgrade.DistUpgradeVersion\n\nEven UFW stopped working. it showed this error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/sbin/ufw\", line 26, in <module>\n    import ufw.frontend\nImportError: No module named ufw.frontend\n\nSo I thought I can re-install python, and life is good.

There were some errors during upgrade, but overall it updated to 14.04 successfully. \nAfter update was done, I ran apt-get install -f and dpkg --configure -a again, and this time got a lot less errors, though still failed. I fixed errors one by one, again by borrowing the broken packages from another server running 14.04.\nAt the end it migrated to 14.04 and all package issues were fixed as well.\n", "Q: How to make Rhythmbox stop continuous auto playing songs Every time I choose only one song from Files, Rhythmbox keeps playing the songs I listened to them before.\nAnyway to make Rhythmbox stop doing that?\n\nA: rhythmbox --rhythmdb-file '' example.mp3\n\nThis tells Rhythmbox to temporarily use another library database filename, in this case an empty string so the library is always empty and never saved.\nYou can use two single quotes (not backticks), or two double quotes, for the empty string. On exiting, it will print this (hopefully) harmless warning: \"Couldn't rename  to .tmp: No such file or directory\".\nYou can also use /dev/null as a filename. Then Rhythmbox will print this (hopefully) harmless warning on exit: \"Can't save XML: Permission denied\".\nIn both cases, it will not interfere with your default library, which you can get back when you don't specify the 'rhythmdb-file' argument.\n\nA: Go to the Edit menu in the toolbar-Preferences-Music. \n\nThere uncheck 'Watch my libraries for new files'.\n", "Q: How to install Gnash SWF player in ubuntu?

To check if ufw is running\nsudo ufw status\n\nIf the firewall is running disable the firewall as a test and try again\nsudo ufw disable\n\nIf after the firewall is down and everything works, we just need to open up the ports on the firewall and try again.\nsudo ufw allow 2049\nsudo ufw allow 111\n\nNow try again. If it is still not working we may have missed a port (so you may want to look into what ports nfs uses and open them up if we missed any)\nIf that's not your issue, then it's port forwarding. You will need to open port 2049   and 111 on the router so that outside connections get forwarded to the right computer. Each router has it's own way of doing it, but usually it is pretty straight forward. Search for \"Your router make/model Port Forwarding\". \nYour basically telling your router to forward all connection requests to 2049 and 111 to the ip address of your nfs server. When your connected locally, the router is able to figure out everything on it's own, but over the internet- the forwarding needs to be setup. Again, if you have further issues, there may be other ports that need to be forwarded to work. Just remember to forward them to the IP address of the nfs server.\n", "Q: How to install Proteus( simulation software) for ubuntu I need Proteus to check some of the circuits I have been working on, but I couldn't find it in software center and its official site.

Just look for the version you downloaded and see what the hash should be\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM - Page shows how to check the iso using different operating systems. If the hash matches up, there is no problem with the iso file so that means something went wrong with the burn.\nIf you don't want to go through the trouble of checking, just download again (I would suggest using torrent) and make sure it finishes. Then burn at the slowest speed possible. Or if you have a usb drive and a bios that supports, just use that instead.\nEdit: I forgot to mention. The reason I say this is you should not be prompted to log in.\n", "Q: Why is it so difficult to change login screen background? Why is it so difficult to change the login screen background ?\nI've tried everything, dconf-editor, Ubuntu Tweak, and every posted remedy with no luck.\n\nA: I am currently on Ubuntu 14.10 and if I go to system settings and select appearance, on the right there is a list of wallpapers. Any wallpaper I select also becomes my login screen. If you click the + at the bottom you can add your own and that will become your wallpaper and login screen.\nOr are you saying you want your desktop wallpaper to be different than your login screen image?\n\nA: Again, I am on the same version and I was just able to complete this task by doing the following steps. \nBefore you get into the main steps you need to move the desired background image to /usr/share/backgrounds.

Is there a way to set an mp4 as an ubuntu wallpaper?

Granted, you'll have to have VLC playing constantly and have the video on loop, but you'll get the desired effect.\nThere's also the side affect that you lose  your icons, but if you don't have icons on your desktop (like me) that's not a big deal.\nUsing VLC:\nJust launch VLC from the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) via cvlc --video-wallpaper --no-audio /path/to/your/video\nAs a note, I took this information from this question.

RAM not used is RAM wasted. \n\nThe Internet goes slowly\n\nRAM usage is not the cause for this. Your connection itself is the slowest part when it is about connecting to internet.\n\nCan you tell me if I have to do something?\n\nNothing to be done here. At least not based on that image alone. \n\nA: You should investigate into what free's reported buffers & cache really are; \"I do not think it means what you think it means.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's a nice explanation with colored images: Understanding the free command in Ubuntu (and Linux)\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux will take unused memory (a.k.a memory not being used by applications and the OS) and use it for disk buffering and caching WHEN IT CAN.\n\n*\"[W]e don’t care about how much memory is being used for buffering and caching. We need to know what is being used by applications and what is available to applications\"\n\n*The Real Free Memory amount is on the -/+ buffers/cache: line\n\n\n*Question on serverfault.com Meaning of the buffers/cache line in the output of free\n\n\n*\n\n*In Linux, what is the difference between “buffers” and “cache” reported by the free command? - \"The \"cached\" total will also include some other memory allocations, such as any tmpfs filesytems\" and also some VM RAM & \"currently open memory-mapped files\" RAM\n\n\n*Here's another ok looking explanation: Understanding free command in Linux/Unix\n\n\n*\n\n*A buffer is a temporary location to store data for a particular application and this data is not used by any other application.\n\n*Cache is a memory location to store frequently used data for faster access.\n\n\n\nA: The best way to optimize memory in Linux is to leave it alone. You should subtract \"cached\" from \"used\" to estimate really free memory, because the \"cached\" one can be emptied at any moment when needed. \nReducing memory consumption is slowing things down, not the other way. \n\nA: I noticed that you had some swap RAM going on. Considering the amount of RAM you are already using, this is likely normal. However, if you have not already done so, you might want to decrease your swappiness to 10 instead of the default 60. Also, you may want to check out lighter versions, such as Lubuntu, if speed is of especial concern. From personal experience, I've noticed that Lubuntu uses less resources than Ubuntu, both in CPU and RAM usage. Come to think of it, your CPU may be a limiting factor in your speed.\nHere's a link on how to decrease swappiness for Lubuntu, might work for Ubuntu as well. Ubuntu uses gedit instead of leafpad. So where you see leafpad, change it to gedit.\nIf none of that makes any difference for you, you might want to look up how to increase the speed of your browser. I know you can make Firefox pipeline, among other tricks.\n", "Q: aero snap left and right in metacity ubuntu 14.10?

I understand I cannot store any files, but that's fine.\n\nA: \nIs there any difference for my purposes between live and installed Ubuntu?\n\nNot much. You're going to have lower performance because you're running off a USB stick or DVD and so it'll take longer to load things. You'll also not have as much RAM available because you've got much of the system loaded into RAM. \nIf you're trying to compile software & other CPU intensive things I wouldn't suggest doing them on the LiveUSB/LiveDVD unless you've got 4GB or more of RAM.\n\nI understand I cannot store any files, but that's fine.\n\nActually, you can!

I recently got in trouble on this site for posting opinion, and so I suppose if I were wise I'd keep my mouth shut.  Guess I'm not wise.\nI declare that in my honest opinion, the BEST way is THE UBUNTU WAY...\nBy default, Ubuntu prenames several folders for Documents, Downloads, Music, and Pictures.  In the olden days, MS Windows never did anything like this, and as soon as they did, they didn't produce a file hierarchy which benefited technicians legitimate attempts to back up client data;  I should know, I was one of them.\nThese days the default hierarchy of personal user data is pretty similar between Ubuntu and Windows, and this help everyone because even minimally indoctrinated technicians can find and backup user data without too much trouble.\nIn addition, Ubuntu gives you the ability to not only add new folders to your home folder, but within the Nautilus file browser, you can easily add what it calls \"bookmarks\" which appear in the same left side lineup, even if they are on entirely separate drives.  Imagine moving the hard drive from your older computer to your current one and instead of copying the files over, you simply bookmark the most important folders into your file browser!\nPlease note that, for better or worse nautilus bookmarks will not be visible if you browse the drive with another file browser such as Gnome Commander, for example.  Links however appear to be independent of the file browser used.\n", "Q: Unable to boot after installing systemd-services and changing the init parameter on boot I tried two different methods but could not install systemd\n1st method from here, 2nd method from here\nConfirmation that systemd is not installed:\nedward@computer:~$ file /lib/systemd/systemd\n/lib/systemd/systemd: ERROR: cannot open `/lib/systemd/systemd' (No such file or directory)\n\nAnother confirmation:\n\nI'm following the methods proposed in https://askubuntu.com/a/420979/294611 (against this question was closed as duplicated to), yet for some reason my system doesn't boot.\n\nA: Well, I´m not sure what Canonical did. When I installed systemd on my Raring installation (as seen in comments), the binary was there. Now it isn´t anywhere, and the changelog before Utopic version 208-8ubuntu1 is useless (utopic does have the binary there), since they just imported the package from Debian, which is a blessing to Utopic users, since the method described in the answer works for them.\nTrusty changelogs doesn´t either explain what could happened either. I checked the BZR repository looking for clues directly about what happened with the package. There´s a systemd.install file in the debian\\ directory, yet the package itself doesn´t exist in repositories; the systemv-init package which replace /sbin/init with a link to systemd binary indeed points to /lib/systemd/systemd, which only adds to my confusion. The control file has an entry for the systemd package too. The systemd.link file also links to /lib/systemd/systemd from the /bin directory.\nAll evidence points that systemd package is necesary to get systemd binary, yet the package itself is not provided anywhere for trusty. This has lead me to think that Canonical decided to not provide systemd binary for releases before trusty in their repositories, which is hinted by the fact that if you build the systemd debian source package that Ubuntu provides you will get the systemd package and all necesary binaries to boot using systemd as init.\nSo, to solve the problem you are facing, because the binary simply isn´t there, you just need to remove the init of your kernel parameters and revert the changes you have done to your /etc/default/grub file and run sudo update-grub, in summary everything you have done in order to replace upstart with systemd. Afterwards, is your call: upgrade to utopic, leave it as it is, or build systemd package from debian sources.\nFor now, I would only recommend Utopic and later users to install systemd, as before that, there´s no sure fire way to install systemd and replace the init with the packages provided by Canonical/Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Impress - View Presentation changes objects layout I having problems with the 'view presentation mode'.

The problem is seems to be that gparted doesn't recognize the partitions or partition labels correctly. I have tried\n-Following the standard instructions for installation (trying to change partitions with gparted first).\n-Changing the partitions with Windows in several ways (creating unallocated space, new drive, free space)\nbut Ubuntus installer never sees the partitions correctly.\n-I have also checked how Windows is booting. It seems to be BIOS instead of UEFI. I have an HP 350 G1 with Windows 7 Pro. I want to use Windows with Android Studio and the newest Eclipse, so deleting Windows doesn't seem to be an option.\nI don't blame Ubuntu. I even tried installing freeBSD and netBSD with the same result. It looks more like Windows is to blame or rather maybe that some Windows 7 computers have technology (EFI motherboard?) that is meant for Windows 8 and that this confuses disk partitioners.\nMaybe the problem will dissappear after Windows 9 comes out???\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. Happy Holiday season to all!\nHello gyropyge! Thank you! I will take another look at the partitions. I seem to recall a very small partition just as you said. Not exactly sure how to copy contents of the little partition, but I will look into it and give it a try. \n\nA: I believe I know what the problem is, and I can tell you how to fix this without deleting or reinstalling Windows.  I've run into this problem twice and fixed it both times with this method.\nYou see, prior to EFI/UEFI, there was a grandfathered-in limit of how many partitions any drive was permitted to have.  I seem to recall the limit is three, or is it two... maybe it is four?  In any case, if you want to have more than x-number of partitions, the \"trick\" involves making one or more \"virtual\" partitions within an \"extended\" partition.  It's been this way since the early 90's or there abouts.  It was always awkward and kludgey, but we accepted and worked with it because that was what we had to do.\nIt appears that Microsoft finally realized they could beat out us LINUX geeks and gain a semi-monopoly of the PCs upon which Windows was installed if all they did was fill the hard drives with primary partitions, so that novices to the artificial limitation would be unable to partition the drive further, but there's a way around this which I will now explain.\nIf you boot your drive with external boot media, such as an Ubuntu Live CD, you can manipulate all of the partitions.  One of the partitions will be quite small, perhaps only a gb and be formatted in something weird like MS-DOS.  If you copy the contents of that partition into a new folder under one of the larger partitions (give it a name like \"moved from msdos partition\"), that frees up an entire partition slot.\nAfter deleting the tiny partition, use gparted to slide all the remaining partitions neatly to the left and create an \"extended\" partition to the right.  But you don't really have to do that because once there's room your ubuntu installer will take care of the rest.  This partition juggling thing is the only thing Ubuntu cannot do for itself.\nSomething else that I do, which you don't really need to do, is that I usually resize partitions while I'm at it to give the new Linux partitions not less than 80gb, personally and divide it into two partitions, one being a 4gb swap partition.  All these things are usually done automatically by Ubuntu to one degree or another.  I've simply been at this long enough (as I can see you have been as well.\nYour final partitioning scheme could very well look EXACTLY like this image I found online.\n", "Q: How to install sage on Ubuntu 14.04?

I checked time zone settings and clock and everything is fine. What's wrong with the crontab file?\n\nA: With you configuration the command test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily ) will in fact be executed at 2:00 AM, but the commands in /etc/cron.daily probably won't! \nLets look at the command more closely:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first command test -x /usr/sbin/anacron checks if the command anacron can be executed, it \"fails\" (returns 1) if /usr/sbin/anacron is not executable\n\n*The || means: Execute the second command it the first one fails\n\n*The second command ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily ) will execute all tasks in the directory /etc/cron.daily, without involving anacron in any way\n\n\nIn short: cron will only run the tasks in /etc/cron.daily if the command /usr/sbin/anacron is not available! anacron is an independent program that has its own heuristics for figuring out when to execute a task.\nIn order to let cron execute tasks at the times given in /etc/crontab, just uninstall the anacron package!

I keep all my files on a personal Seagate cloud on my network so I am not worried about losing anything. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I had similar issue in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 LTS, running kernel version 3.13.0-43.  I added an HDMI display (no sound capability) to my desktop as an addition to my older DVI monitor.  Attempting to add the new screen from boot/power-on caused a system freeze.  Attempts to add the HDMI display after boot via the Display applet under Settings Manager prompted a scrambled screen and system or X crashed (couldn't tell which one, screen unresponsive to anything but hard power cycle).\nAs mcchid mentioned, booting to an earlier kernel version -in this case 3.13.0-40- resolved the issue (you can boot to prior kernels under the Advanced options in the Grub boot menu).\nInterestingly, I found a strikingly similar issue with kernel 3.17.3 (Kernel Bug Tracker – Bug 88481) that had the exact same error message I had been getting from DMESG: BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffec2000000900.  This seems to have possibly been brought on by commit ffe0245532b98efc4bc0e06f29c51d3f0e471152 in at least the case of the later kernel version.\n\nA: If you want to do a fresh install and are sure that you have backed up everything like you said, then you can do that.\nBut you can try running sudo apt-get install linux-image-3.13.0-34-generic before doing that. This should install the kernel you were only able to boot in recovery mode (as I read it) and update the GRUB menu list to be fully functional again.\nThe package manager keeps a log of updated packages in /var/log/apt/history.log we could dig through these to find if there is any related issue to that.

Everything installed fine and worked almost perfectly. Almost because for some reasons, after the system booted, the writing was so small that I could not understand them, even after changing the resolution to the lowest possible. \nAfter a reboot, everything went to normal. \nFor a few days the system worked magnificently, until today, after leaving the PC on at lunch, the system froze and I had to hard reboot.

Today, I got Windows 7 and installed it on a separate drive with the Ubuntu drive removed. Now I can boot each OS by interrupting the BIOS and changing the boot order, so I know both bootloaders work, but when I ran sudo update-grub and sudo udpate-grub2, Windows was not listed. What can I do to add Windows to grub?\n\nA: Try to locate and mount the Windows partition first, then run sudo update-grub. \nFor example, \nsudo fdisk -l \nresults \n/dev/sda1            2048  53035007 53032960 25.3G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda2        53035008  99139583 46104576   22G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda3        99139584 141266943 42127360 20.1G 83 Linux\n/dev/sda4  *    141266944 215681023 74414080 35.5G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nin this case the Windows partition is /dev/sda4 (because of NTFS Type and because I know it). Then, \nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /mnt \nand then \nsudo update-grub \nWindows entry in grub.cfg is nothing special. It is just a chainloader entry. If above method fails to identify Windows properly, then you can manually add the entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom file. \nExample of Windows 40_custom entry for MBR (not GPT) \nmenuentry \"Windows 7 64bit\" --class windows --class os {\n        insmod part_msdos\n        insmod ntfs\n        set root='hd0,msdos4'\n        chainloader +1\n}\n\nWhat matters here is the set root parameter. hd0,msdos4 = /dev/sda4. If you have more than one HDDs then it might be hd1,msdos4 = /dev/sdb4.\nIf you follow the manual method, don't forget to run sudo update-grub after editing the 40_custom file. \n", "Q: I can not install my printer I have a Brother DCP-150C Printer.

The upgrade proceeded without any complaints. (I've done many upgrades before, dating back to some really old Ubuntu releases, and they usually work.)\nAt the end of the upgrade, the system tried to reboot, but I got a flash on the screen of something about a boot error. After that it wouldn't boot at all.\nThe main disk is an SSD with 3 partitions: the EFI partition, the /boot partition, and a partition containing a LUKS encrypted LVM volume. From a live CD, I can mount those and see that they at least look OK.\nIs there some process to follow that will allow me to get that drive to be bootable? There are thousands of recommendations to use the \"boot-repair\" tool, but it has no effect whatsoever (the Boot-Repair URL for those who care). I've got the laptop BIOS set to boot from UEFI; I didn't change it for the upgrade, but I did check after things went wrong.\nI should mention that when I say that the machine \"won't boot\" I mean that it behaves as if the drive is simply not bootable. The BIOS lets me select it as a boot device, but an attempt to boot from it gets absolutely nowhere. There are no diagnostics, and no sign that it's even trying to boot.\n\nA: I'll link to the blog/wiki page I found this solution on when I find it, because I really don't entirely understand what was going on.\nThe UEFI boot mechanism, as I understand it, is supposed to interpret the layout of the EFI filesystem and provide the person booting the computer with a choice of which boot loader to use. In the EFI filesystem on my machine after the upgrade, I had an \"ubuntu\" directory with a \"grubx64.efi\" file in it. The Thinkpad, however, did not seem to pay any attention to that, and that's why it treated the SSD as being unbootable.\nThis mystery blog post I found suggested that a way to work around the bad behavior of some stupid UEFI BIOS implementations is to create a \"boot\" subdirectory in the EFI file system, and to copy the GRUB loader to a file called \"bootx64.efi\" there. That is:\nmkdir /mnt/efi\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi\nmkdir /mnt/efi/EFI/boot\ncp /mnt/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /mnt/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi\n\nI did that from the Live CD (well, Live DVD) and rebooted. To my absolute amazement, that was all it took. Apparently the \"boot\" EFI subdirectory is the default, so even dumb BIOS implementations will find that.\nI don't know what will happen as I go forward updating the 14.10 environment. I guess that whenever I do an apt-get upgrade I'll check to see if the grub boot file has been update, and copy it over into the \"boot\" fake directory.\nThis is probably a per-BIOS weirdness.\n", "Q: AMD Hybrid catalyst driver installation for 14.10 Is there any worked procedure to install catalyst driver on AMD Hybrid with powerXpress on Utopic?

Starting ccminer causes error \nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia': No such device\n[2014-12-26 03:26:50] Unable to query number of CUDA devices!

I added the xorg-edgers PPA ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa.\nCurrently the usage is unclear for me because there's no --help argument (requested as https://github.com/cbuchner1/ccminer/issues/29), but it might be retrievable from somewhere.\nAfter installation of the CUDA examples with /usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-install-samples-6.5.sh ~/cuda-examples/ I ran the deviceQuery binary which fails with \nbin/x86_64/linux/release/deviceQuery Starting...\n\n CUDA Device Query (Runtime API) version (CUDART static linking)\n\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia': No such device\ncudaGetDeviceCount returned 38\n-> no CUDA-capable device is detected\nResult = FAIL\n\nand optirun deviceQuery which fails with \nbin/x86_64/linux/release/deviceQuery Starting...\n\n CUDA Device Query (Runtime API) version (CUDART static linking)\n\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module nvidia-uvm not found.\ncudaGetDeviceCount returned 30\n-> unknown error\nResult = FAIL\n\n\nA: I had this same problem and just got ccminer working by using auto Nvidia symbolic link with update-alternatives.

(easy detection of changes is the point).\nIs this possible?\nRight now it echoes for every file, even if there has been no change.\nI am using this command:\nzip -r --test \"Dest.zip\" ./Source\n\n\nA: What you probably want is to update the zip file:\n\nupdate (-u): Update existing entries if newer on the file system and add new files.  If the archive does not exist issue warning then create a new archive.\n\nTherefore, you should try\nzip -ru \"Dest.zip\" ./Source\n\n", "Q: Which apps read/write an SQLite 3 database in Ubuntu? Have an app on another device which exports an SQLite v3 database. I wish to read and alter the content of that .db file. Tried Libre Office Base, no joy. Which apps will read that .db file, and edit it?  Hoping for a GUI app.\n\nA: There is an application in the repositories for Ubuntu versions before 18.04 called sqliteman.  It is listed in those repositories as \"GUI tool for SQLite3 admin and developers alike\".\nI haven't used it much but it seems like it's a readily available GUI tool in the repositories.  If you are using a version of Ubuntu earlier than 18.04, you can install it with apt-get install sqliteman.\n\nA: A method would be to use mozilla's firefox plugin called sqlite manager:\n\n\nA: Take a look at SQLite Studio. Despite it is not available in Ubuntu packages repositories, it works perfectly well on this OS and is free and open-source.\n\nThe project is maintained since 2007 (as of 2018). It's multiplatform, feature rich and can be extended by plugins.\nFull history is available if you feel like curious.\n\nA: Try DB Browser for SQLite. From the site:\n\nDB Browser for SQLite is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.\nIt is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search, and edit data. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.\nControls and wizards are available for users to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create and compact database files\n  \n*Create, define, modify and delete tables\n  \n*Create, define and delete indexes\n  \n*Browse, edit, add and delete records\n  \n*Search records\n  \n*Import and export records as text\n  \n*Import and export tables from/to CSV files\n  \n*Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files\n  \n*Issue SQL queries and inspect the results\n  \n*Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application\n  \n\nInstall with sudo apt install sqlitebrowser\n\nA: Check out Beekeeper Studio. It's MIT licensed, works great with SQLite and can handle MySQL, PSQL, SQL Server as well.\nMy friend and I built it because we wanted a more modern feeling and easier to use SQL editor that worked for all database types.\nI use it every day. Hope others like it too.\n\n", "Q: Deleted the python binary, and can't recover using apt-get, what can I do? Well. Yep. Wanted a fresh start because I was having dependency confusions, so I ran \"whereis python\" and literally erased all of the files and directories that came up.

Do not manually remove (or otherwise mess with) any files installed via package management tools (unless they are explicitly set up for this like configuration files, etc.).\nThat being said if you are unable (and it looks like this might be the case) to use apt-get to recover from this situation because there are parts of the process that expect that python is already installed then you have a few options (not all of which will necessarily work).\nYou can fetch the python (and related) .deb files manually and attmempt to use dpkg to install them manually (you'll need to resolve the dependency order manually to make sure this works correctly). Something like:\napt-get download python2.7-minimal ## at least this package is necessary\nsudo touch /usr/bin/python2.7 && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/python2.7\nsudo dpkg --unpack python2.7-minimal*\n\nYou should check for other missing binaries, like pycompile, and apply the same solution.\nAfter this, is recommendable to check the dpkg database looking for non configured, half-configured and just unpacked packages:\nsudo dpkg --check\n\nRead the messages and apply fixes, but normally it would ask for sudo dpkg --configure -a. An sudo apt-get -f install could help depending the situation.\nYou might also be able to use an installation media recovery mode (or reinstallation) to fix this.\n\nA: Open a terminal and type the following commands:\nFirst, try \nsudo apt-get -f install \n\nIf that doesn't work, try \nsudo dpkg --configure -a \n\nIf you are still left with problems, run \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python python-chardet python-colorama python-distlib python-django python-django-tables2 python-six python-html5lib python-lxml python-minimal python-pkg-resources python-setuptools python-urllib3 python-requests python-pip python-virtualenv\n\nAs a last resort, you might need to remove these packages with the following command and then reinstall these packages using the above command. If this is the case, you will need to pay very close attention. There will be a list of packages uninstalled with the following command. You will need to copy this list and paste it into gedit. With gedit open and the list of packages pasted into gedit, press ctrl + h and enter \\n followed by two spaces in \"Search for\" and one space in \"Replace with\" to remove all the paragraphs and extra spaces before clicking replace all so that your list contains a list of packages separated only by single spaces.\nsudo apt-get purge python-chardet python-colorama python-distlib python-django python-django-tables2 python-six python-html5lib python-lxml python-minimal python-pkg-resources python-setuptools python-urllib3 python-requests python-pip python-virtualenv\n\nFinally, run: sudo apt-get install and paste in the list of packages from gedit to reinstall everything.\n\nA: You should remove each package that gives you difficulties, then reinstall them.\nSee https://askubuntu.com/a/32899/176376 for removal without removing dependancies.\nsudo dpkg -r --force-depends \"package\"\n\nsudo apt-get install \"package\"\n\nYou should remove all of the problem ones first, and then install them again.\nRun a sudo apt-get install -f and sudo dpkg --configure -a every few commands.\n\nA: I see you have errors like this:\npython2.7: not found\n\nIt means the python 2.7 executable cannot be found. I have used these command to find the package containing it (that would probably not work on your broken system, however)\n$ which python2.7\n/usr/bin/python2.7\n$ dpkg -S /usr/bin/python2.7\npython2.7-minimal: /usr/bin/python2.7\n\nYou need to reinstall it, but first you need to go through its dependencies. Use this commands to list them:\n$ apt-cache depends python2.7-minimal\npython2.7-minimal\n  Depends: libpython2.7-minimal\n  Depends: zlib1g\n  PreDepends: libc6\n  Suggests: binfmt-support\n    binfmt-support:i386\n  Recommends: python2.7\n  Conflicts: binfmt-support\n  Conflicts: binfmt-support:i386\n  Replaces: python2.7\n  Replaces: python2.7:i386\n  Conflicts: python2.7-minimal:i386\n\nlibpython2.7-minimal is probably damaged. So I recommend you to first issue:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libpython2.7-minimal\n\nthen:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python2.7-minimal\n\nand then hopefully your\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nwill succeed.\n\nA: That's expected behaviour. Deleting files is not the same as uninstalling a package or program.\nYou've deleted all the python related stuff from your install, but your package manager doesn't know this. When you go to install Python again, apt expects all those files to still be there and doesn't bother trying to re-download them. As far as apt is concerned, all of python is still installed; You never told it otherwise.\nYou can try the following to attempt to correct this:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python\nIn the future, uninstall packages using apt-get remove or apt-get purge or graphically from the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n", "Q: Installing a theme for rEFInd and finding rEFInd file MAC So I am attempting to add a theme to rEFInd, as I don't like how it looks, but I am a complete newbie when it comes to terminal and looking for usually hidden files.

It just knows what you want to do and you can concentrate on development and not on remembering package names:\n\nEdit:\nAn easy way to do it in the command-line is to search the src.zip file which comes with the SDK.

Mediawiki works perfectly when I type the hostname of the server into a browser on one of my network's Windows clients. I've used both:\nhttp://servername/mediawiki\n\nand\nhttp://servername/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nBoth work fine in Chrome and IE running in Windows.\nBut neither work on either Ubuntu Desktop or Mac OS clients. Enter both the URLs above and I get an error message telling me the server isn't found.\nI think it's a problem with Apache, because its default page is accessible from Windows clients if I simply type:\nhttp://servername/\n\nOn Linux or Mac OS clients, that just gets a 'server not found' error. On both operating systems, I can get to the default Apache page using the IP address - but simply adding '/mediawiki' to the IP address then also brings up 'server not found'.\nBut, if I type the following into Mac OS or Ubuntu Desktop clients, I do see the Wiki's home page:\nhttp://server_IP_address/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nHowever, I can only see the contents of the page - devoid of all formatting, as if a link to a relevant CSS file had been broken. \nI'm reading up on Apache now - but this doesn't seem to be a common problem (or possibly I'm not using the right search terms).\nCan anyone give some pointers as to where I should be looking for faults here?

As I said in the comment above, I had left the default network settings in place even after installing Apache and Bind. There was no way that the clients could resolve the local hostnames to the relevant IP addresses.\nTo fix this, I installed Bind on my Ubuntu server and then added my server to the list of DNS servers my router queries when it gets a request for a web service. \nI did this by following these tutorials:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-bind-as-a-private-network-dns-server-on-ubuntu-14-04\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/dns-configuration.html#dns-primarymaster-configuration\nThis was also helpful for ensuring that Linux clients were able to use the DNS server:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ubuntus-new-dns-unknown-host\n\nWindows and Mac OS clients on the network seemed to have no problem taking their DNS settings from the router. The Ubuntu clients didn't and consequently couldn't resolve hostnames, until I updated /etc/network/interfaces (after having first backed it up to interfaces.old using the 'sudo mv' command).\nIf I find a better way to do any of this, I'll update this answer. \n", "Q: What are the different types of directories do we have? I wanted to know the difference between root and home directories. How do I reallocate some more space to for faster functioning of the Virtualbox, the other OS that I have is Windows XP ? Thank you!\n\nA: \nWhat are the different types of directories do we have?\n\nAll directories are the same. There are no \"types\" of directories.\nIn general:\nLinux does use permissions for owner, groups and others to decide if someone can see, edit/delete/write and, or execute. \"root\" is such a user. So is your account (admin through sudo) and any normal account on your system;if any. \n\"/home/user/\" (\"user\" will be a name on your system) directories are owned by \"user\" and a user can do almost anything inside that location. Outside \"/home/user/\" what that user can do depends on the permissions of that location. Most of the system will be owned by \"root\" and thus inaccessible for none admin users, and only accessible to an admin user using \"sudo\". If for instance a user wants to use an external disk the admin needs to grant the permissions for that user use be able to use it.\n\nHow do I reallocate some more space to for faster functioning of the Virtualbox,\n\n\"space\" and \"faster\" are 2 different things.\n\n\n*\n\n*you add more \"space\" to a virtual machine by editing the virtual machine and to increase the space it can use. This is \"space\" you can use for storing files. That does NOT make your VM quicker.\n\n*\"faster\" is related to RAM. If you need your VM to be quicker responding increase the amount of RAM, vRAM and/or CPUs.

(I read somewhere that Linux systems don't like FSs with the \"journaled\" option, but I don't know if this [still] true.)\nIs there a better choice as far as Ubuntu-compatibility is concerned?\n\nA: Through the Disk Utility UI (OS X 10) I just formatted a 32gb USB to Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Case sensitive) and my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can read the files on it. \n\nA: I am not sure if the MacOS filesystems work with Ubuntu, so I can't answer that one.\nBut your remark about journaling filesystems is not true. The default FS on most Linux distros is EXT3 or EXT4, and both are journaling FS'es. So you don't have to worry about journaling and I would advise to choose a FS that offers this feature.\nMaybe it's better to use a Linux utility to format your disk to play nice with MacOS, since (AFAIK) the EXT FS works very will with Mac. If the Mac utility offers this option, I would go for that.\n", "Q: What to do after unzipping the Java EE 7 sdk .zip file? I am quite new to Linux.

What are the next steps??I already have JDK 8 installed on my ubuntu. the JAVA_HOME variable is set at \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle\". \n\nA: What you should do next depends on what you want to do. I guess when you want to develop something you surely use a very good java IDE. In this case, the IDE needs to know the place of your SDK so that it can use the compiler and the libraries. In IDEA, you only need to tell where you unpacked the SDK zip and it sets up everything for you. On my machine, I have all java SDK's in my home directory and the IDEA and it looks like the following\n\nWhen you are using another IDE like Netbeans or Eclipse, then the way to tell the IDE about the SDK might be a bit different, but the general approach is the same.\n", "Q: Regarding reboot problem I have been installing Ubuntu 14.04 along with Windows 8.1. after completion of whole the process of installation, I was not able to find \"dual os selection\" dialog.

From what I could tell, this is supposed to be handled in the file /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb. That file specifies button presses to catch and turns them into \"standard\" events like presentation and displaytoggle.  But this isn't working properly in 14.04. \nThe comments in the top of that file tell you how to override it.  So I followed the instructions and it worked!  Below are the instructions I followed.  I copied the section out and modified it to work like it does on Windows.  These bindings work on LibreOffice Impress that comes with 14.04 as well as evince in presentation mode.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open your text editor.\n\n*Copy the following and paste into the editor.\n# Logitech Presenter R400\nkeyboard:usb:v046DpC52Dd*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*in00*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_070029=esc\n KEYBOARD_KEY_07003e=f5\n KEYBOARD_KEY_070037=b\n\n\n*Save the file as 70-keyboard.hwdb.\n\n*Open a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T.\n\n*Change directory to where you saved the file, if necessary.\n\n*Copy the file to the appropriate place so that it overrides the bad entry and doesn't get clobbered by updates by running the following command.  Enter your password when prompted.\nsudo cp 70-keyboard.hwdb /etc/udev/hwdb.d\n\n\n*Do udev magic so that our changes are picked up. \nsudo udevadm hwdb --update\nsudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event*\n\n\n*It doesn't say so in the file, but I had to reboot before the changes took.  \nOne note that I found important.  Apparently, Windows doesn't use a single key to \"toggle\" into and out of presentation mode.  F5 is used to begin the presentation and ESC is used to end the presentation.  To give the effect of toggling presentation mode on and off, the remote itself first sends F5 then sends ESC.  \nSo if the presentation has been started by you pressing F5 at the keyboard, pressing the \"presentation\" button on the remote will do nothing at first button press.  It just sends F5 again.  The second time you press the \"presentation\" button, it sends ESC and the presentation will end.\n", "Q: Wifi dropping on Lenovo G50-70 I'm having problems with my WiFi on a Lenovo G50-70 which uses the Realtek RTL8723BE chip.

Here's what finally worked for me and seems to be working for others on 14.04:\nDownload the latest driver (you might have to install git first)\ngit clone http://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new.git\n\nChange into the new directory you just created\ncd rtlwifi_new\n\nCompile and install the new driver\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nEdit the settings for the driver\necho \"options rtl8723be fwlps=0 swlps=0\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\n\nIt's probably a good idea to take a look at that file to make sure that worked. Some people say the \"swlps=0\" part of the command above is unnecessary. I'm not sure but it doesn't seem to be hurting anything.\nReboot. \nThe next time your system updates the kernel, you may have to do this part again:\ncd rtlwifi_new\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nI'd be curious to hear if others have tried this on releases other than 14.04 with success.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to replace Ubuntu host with Windows 7 installed in a virtual machine? I have installed Windows 7 Using VirtualBox in Ubuntu.\nI want my primary Operating system as Windows 7.\nPlease guide me how to uninstall/delete Ubuntu\n\nA: Because Windows is in VirtualBox, you can't remove the Ubuntu operating system, as it's the host OS for the guest VirtualBox OS.\nYou'd have to install Windows to the hard drive, wiping the system totally in the process, in order to use Windows 7 as your primary OS.  IF you've already used your activation key, Microsoft might have a problem with it.\n\nA: Okay you will need a dvd or usb stick with a windows 7 iso on it. Firstly boot into windows on your machine. Then press the start button and search for disc management (It should be called create or edit partition or something).\nFind your ubuntu partition, right click it and press delete. Then extend the volume of your windows partition. If you restart now you will get a grub boot error.\nBoot into that dvd or usb with the windows 7 iso, click install, then there should be a advanced option or something. Click cmd prompt and type \"bootrec /fixmbr\" and \"bootrec /fixboot\" without quotation marks. If you did it correctly it should just boot into windows and your ubuntu partition will be gone.\nIt's sad to see you go but I'm sure you have your reasons.

How to solve? Should I need to apply any patch?\n\nA: If you used this method of installing Gnome 3.14 (basically using the ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging and/or ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 PPAs - the article also details some problems that occur in Unity caused by installing 3.14), you should be able to use the following:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\n\nThis disables the PPAs and any reverts to the official repositories' packages, downgrading Gnome 3.14 back to the default installed version. This should restore the bugs of large icons, Ambiance theme problems, client-side decorations etc if you want to use Unity not Gnome 3.14.\n", "Q: Chown-ed windows partition I need some help, if you could have a look.\nI have a laptop dualbooting Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.\nI was trying to share some files on my home network, both from my external hard drive, and from my Windows partition, but I couldn't access it due to wrong permissions.

(Microsoft provides legitimate ISO downloads from their website) Then boot from that disc and there should be a repair option.

I have a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop with a broadcom wireless card. I have successfully installed Lubuntu and gotten the WLAN working in the past.

I can use a netowrk cable to do this but I'm trying to use this as a leaning experience to better understand how the linux installation process works.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 Server (guest machine) on VirtualBox having Windows 7 as host machine. \nI make a \"Server12.04\" named folder on my Host machine desktop & shared the same in Virtual Box (ticked the auto-mount option). How can i access the shared folder in the guest machine (which \nis Ubuntu server 12.04).\nI got one refrence answer from Link but this was not helpfull. Whenever i tried to share the folder \ni got the following error :- \nThe program 'VmBoxManage'  is currently not installed. You can install it by typing apt-get install virtualbox.  Means why to install VirtualBox inside the VirtualBox ??\nPlease help me out . Thanks in advance !!\n\nA: On your host OS, you create the shared folder by running\nVBoxManage sharedfolder add \"VM name\" --name \"sharename\" --hostpath \"C:\\test\"\n\nOn your guest system, you have to run \nmkdir /home/<user>/vboxshare\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 share /home/<user>/vboxshare\n\nVBoxManage can change the settings of a VirtualBox, but if you already have this share created, there's no need to run this command.\n\nA: TL;DR\nOn Ubuntu Server, without guest additions, manually mount the shared folder on the guest, e.g.:\nmkdir /mnt/sharedfolder\nsudo mount -t vboxsf FolderNameInVBoxSettings /mnt/sharedfolder\n\nIf the above works fine, add a corresponding entry in /etc/fstab to make it permanent.\nDetailed Intructions\nLet me share what has worked for me in two different setups, an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Desktop and an Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Server on a Windows 10 host. I will use an example username sun. The first step is common, and is done via the VirtualBox UI (I have 6.1.26 at the time of posting), by selecting the target VM and going to Settings > Shared Folders and clicking the \"Add shared folder\" button:\n\nOn the dialog box, I entered the Windows source path in \"Folder Path\", an arbitrary name for the shared folder under \"Folder Name\", and the \"Mount Point\" which is a valid path of my choosing, on the guest. Note that \"somename\" should be an empty directory:\n\nFor Ubuntu Desktop\nFor a desktop, I also ticked the \"Auto-mount\" option above. Assuming that guest additions have already been installed, and that the somename directory exists, then that's all there is to it. The shared folder will be visible, even on reboot.\nTo avoid having to use sudo every time to access the shared folder, I did one more thing:\nsudo adduser sun vboxsf\n\nFor Ubuntu Server\nFor the server, without guest additions installed, I took note of the ArbitraryName above, because I will need to use the same name for the mount command on the Linux guest:\nmkdir /home/sun/somename\nsudo mount -t vboxsf ArbitraryName /home/sun/somename\n\nI check that I can see the files:\ncd /home/sun/somename\nls\n\nYes, the Windows files are there! But this mount will be lost on reboot, so I make it permanent by adding an entry to /etc/fstab:\n$ sudo vim /etc/fstab\n\n# My VirtualBox shared folder entry in /etc/fstab\nArbitraryName    /home/sun/somename   vboxsf   defaults  0   0\n\nAgain, ArbitraryName must be the same one specified in VirtualBox settings, i.e. the same one we used in the previous mount test command. Now I can reboot the machine and after login, I can do ls /home/sun/somename to see my Windows shared folder files! As a bonus, I didn't like the green highlight on the shared folder directories, so I added the following to my ~/.bashrc:\nexport LS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS:'ow=1;34:';\n\nThe above gets rid of that highlighting but still keeps the other colors, such as blue for directories.

You can make sure you are completely up to date by executing the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu vs Windows : Virus definition Does Ubuntu gets a virus??\ni think it doesn't but then if it doesn't then why so??\nwhat separates Ubuntu and Windows that viruses can not be defined for Ubuntu??\n\nA: Up till today Ubuntu (or better: Linux) can get a virus in theory. There are some ways to get a virus but up to now they need your co-operation. You need to download the virus from somewhere suspicious (we Ubuntu users 9 out of 10 times use the safe Ubuntu Software Center making us a harder target). You need to activate the virus by running the code that holds the virus. \nSome might say that the amount of users play a big part in why Windows is targeted more by virus. I doubt that for 1 reason: IF someone can break Linux with a virus that could spread itself over other Linux systems they would become infamous. And pride is a big part for the hackers that matter (not the script kids that copy/paste code and change 1 line of code). \nWindows is and has been broken from the start so it is an easy target. Microsoft would have done a so much better operating system if they enforced an admin account and sandboxed the users account. Got a virus? Delete the user acccount and their infected files but the system itself would remain safe. \n\nA: Unlike other operating systems like Windows, Gnu/Linux, there are no executable files (.exe) so it is impossible that you run a virus without your consent. \nYou need to explicitly indicate to run a script. \nIf a virus was able to run, could not infect anything since there are no executable files.\nIn Gnu/Linux, processes, create codes called Daemons.\nThat is, if you had an FTP server, you would have a daemon listening on port 21 and upon receipt of a connection, the demon would create a process that would manage and continue listening for more connections. \nThe only user who has access to the demons, SU superuser (root). Only root has permission to drive the demons. \nIf a virus penetrated your system as a normal user would do so could not attack the daemon. In the event that the virus affected the process created by the daemon, this, would be active until the end of the process and during its execution, and could not infect anything or produce any effect.\nAlso, if anyone would look into ways of infecting the system, weaken or open a hole in your security, before a user of the alarm to the community in a very short time the patch as an update on all PCs it would have world as GNU / Linux is not just an OS, it is also the community's behind.\n\nA: Millions (billions?) of people use Windows -> BIG target for bad guys\nNowhere near as many people use Ubuntu (and those that do are generally tech savvy & not good \"victims\") -> tiny tiny target for bad guys\n", "Q: Gnome System Monitor shows only 5.7 GiB RAM of 8GB installed Some time ago, I reinstalled Ubuntu, like I did a lot of time before.\nSince then, Gnome System Monitor and System Information (and any other graphical tool I tried, for that matter) show only 5,7 GiB of my 8GB RAM installed.\nI have installed the 64bit version and did never have this problem on a previous install.\nI found some questions with similar issues, but none of the answers seem to apply to my case, as this is neither a hardware limitation (as it worked before) nor the wrong system installed.\nCan somebody make an educated guess where this could come from?

In the process, I also reset my UEFI (now using efi and secure boot instead of legacy).\nThis fixed the problem for me. I cannot be sure what the actual problem was. But:\nOn my old installation Windows reported less RAM, too. Therefore I guess resetting the UEFI was the solution. It seems to be a bug in the UEFI firmware (nevertheless, updating it did not fix the issue).\n\nA: Memtest seems to do that, reports what \"block size\" it's currently testing, even if the installed memory doesn't go that high. But it does appear to report 6036 megs...\nAnd free only sees 6,000,984k, or 6GB too. \nIf your BIOS also reports only 6GB, then it looks like something's happened to your other 2GB or ram... Maybe it's come loose & re-seating it could help, or maybe it's gone or failed? \n\nAfter updated info:\nUEFI's a whole other can of worms, I'm not sure if it's related but nothing else stands out as different...

I was just wondering, did Amazon make some kind of donation to get this high-profile Ubuntu status? How did this come to pass? Curious about the financial situation there. Amazon's great don't get me wrong, I use it almost every day.\n\nA: Article on pcworld: Ubuntu's Unity 8 desktop will remove the Amazon search 'spyware'\n\nWhen Unity 8 is stable and ready, Ubuntu won’t send your local searches over the web and show you Amazon product results anymore, quelling some longstanding fears in the open-source community.\n...\nUbuntu 12.04 added an extremely controversial feature—searches you perform in Unity’s dash are sent over the web and you’re presented with results to buy products on Amazon. So, for example, when you search for a terminal application, you’re shown the 2004 movie “The Terminal” on DVD and Blu-ray for purchase. ...\nThis was probably the most contentious move in Ubuntu’s history ...\nThe Free Software Foundation’s Richard Stallman branded the Amazon feature “spyware.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation asked Ubuntu to disable this feature and provided a guide to turning it off, saying it was “a major privacy problem.”\n...\nCanonical’s response to the criticism was perceived as awfully high-handed by many. Founder Mark Shuttleworth wrote: “We are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Don't trust us? Erm, we have root.\"\nWhile it’s true that Ubuntu has root (or administrator) access because you’re running software provided by them, the response seems a bit in poor taste. Free software and Linux distributions were supposed to be different than big operating systems—more about user choice and freedom. Ubuntu’s application launcher now came with a prominent “privacy policy” link, and there was no easy graphical way to disable this feature. They only added a toggle switch in the next release of Ubuntu, six months later. This just all felt wrong.\n\nAnd perhaps How can I remove Amazon search results from the dash or disable the feature?\n\nA: From techmansworld.com :\nBy default the Amazon icon is in the launcher, and it has an affiliate tag for Canonical to make money off of your purchases, to support the Ubuntu project. There is in fact settings to set whether you want your searches to be sent to online services (Amazon) or not.  \nFrom howtogeek.com:\nWhen you perform any search in Unity’s dash, your search terms will be sent to Canonical. Canonical forwards these search terms to third parties, such as Amazon, on your behalf. This means that Amazon can’t tie your searches to you personally.\nCanonical receives these search results from Amazon and sends them back to your computer, where they’re displayed in the dash. \nFrom http://www.markshuttleworth.com:\nWe picked Amazon as a first place to start because most of our users are also regular users of Amazon, and it pays us to make your Amazon journey  get off to a faster start. Typing Super “queen marking cage”  Just Worked for me this morning. I am now looking forward to my game of Ultimate Where’s Waldo hunting down the queens in my bee colonies, Ubuntu will benefit from the fact that I chose to search Amazon that way, Amazon benefits from being more accessible to a very discerning, time-conscious and hotkey-friendly audience.\nBut there are many more kinds of things you can search through with Unity scopes. Most of them won’t pay Ubuntu a cent, but we’ll still integrate them into the coolest just-ask-and-you’ll-receive experience. I want us to do this because I think we can make the desktop better.\nWe are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Don’t trust us? Erm, we have root. You do trust us with your data already. You trust us not to screw up on your machine with every update. You trust Debian, and you trust a large swathe of the open source community. And most importantly, you trust us to address it when, being human, we err.\nMy opinion:\nSo in general Amazon issue is intended to be profitable for everyone - You get better results while searching,Canonical gets paid to be able to write better software for users, Amazon gets better access for its customers.\n", "Q: How do I make Firefox Developer Edition my default browser?

Without internet I can't connect to an image archive during the initial installation steps. \nEven without the Ethernet cable plugged into the NAS the installer tries to detect an Ethernet link and fails. When it fails I have the option of manually configuring a connection or skipping network config until later.\nI have tried skipping network config and the installer still wants me to enter an Ubuntu archive mirror. I cannot seem to get passed this point in the install. I have verified the hash and attempted the install using both Ubuntu server 14.1 x64 and 14.04 x64 .iso's to no avail. \nI have come across several tutorials and forum posts with people having similar issues but none quite like this one. Every one says to just skip network configuration and it will let you continue but I am not having the same results. \nIs there any way to bypass choosing an archive mirror during installation? Or do I need to to try an older version? Its hard but not impossible for me seek out a legacy version to see if the network configuration step can be skipped in an earlier release. \nUpdate: I finally came across the notice regarding updating to 14.04 requiring internet access to an apt repository. I assume that this applies to doing a fresh install as well. I guess I will need to find an older version to install.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. I'm in an isolated room with no internet access. When I try to install the image ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64.iso from USB (written to USB thumbdrive with Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.6.2) and after skipping the network config (after choosing language and keyboard layout), it simply insists on choosing a regional mirror on the internet, and gives me no alternative, and won't continue without connecting to one. I can't find any other image to allow \"offline\" installation. What can I do?\nEDIT: I finally found out, after reading many other posts, that the solution is: It seems that all the Windows imaging tools (I tried 3) can't handle this ISO image correctly. Finally I gave up and went to a coworker with a native Linux PC and he copied the ISO via dd and now everything works offline without demanding a mirror. Apparently the installer is not robust and misleads instead of simply reporting there is a problem with the local media.\n\nA: Try to change boot mode in BIOS from UEFI to non-UEFI for your USB-drive. This mode selects other image to start, and, obviously, the UEFI version needs network to download files. Or, maybe, in UEFI mode linux kernel doesn't see the original flash drive, and so, doesn't have the local source of files for installing. This forces the install menu to ask for mirror.\nAny way, the same iso image acts differently on one real PC and under VirtualBox. Even given order and variety of install actions differs\n", "Q: Live Ubuntu for old Desktop PC I have an old desktop PC with following configuration...\nAMD Athelon 1.4 GHz\n256 MB RAM\n40 GB IDE HDD\n8-MB shared VRAM\nUSB 1.0\nExternal Sony CD/DVD RW connecting through USB\nWhich is the best version of Ubuntu live OS that can be used for this PC.

In what configuration file is the LANGUAGE environment variable set? (Or how can I change it by other means?)\nBackground: I was playing around with language settings in kubuntu and installed Russian by accident. Now it won't totally go away. Yes, english shows up in the GUI, but it's Russian on the command line. As best I can figure, it's due to the LANGUAGE environment variable. See the third line:\nleon@leon-Desktop:~$ locale\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en:ru:en\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_ADDRESS=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_ALL=\n\nEverything is set correctly except for LANGUAGE. I've gone through a number of instructions for how to configure the locale/language, but nothing seems to change LANGUAGE (although they have changed other environmental variables, like LANG). So, I'm not interested in an overview of how to change the locale. I need to specifically know how to change LANGUAGE (unless I'm totally misunderstanding the situation). For what it's worth, LANG is set in /etc/default/locale, but LANGUAGE is not set there. (I tried setting LANGUAGE there, and it gets overridden somehow.) If I manually set LANGUAGE to en, then that particular shell works fine, so I think that only LANGUAGE needs to be changed.\n\nEDIT:\nJust to make clear, setting LANGAUGE in /etc/default/locale does not help. Additionally, ~/.pam_environment does not exist.\nSee below. LANGUAGE is set to \"en\" in /etc/default/locale. I restarted the machine. I verified the contents of /etc/default/locale. However, apt-get still outputs in Russian because LANGUAGE was overwritten elsewhere (producing the above output from locale).\nleon@leon-Desktop:~$ cat /etc/default/locale \nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLANGUAGE=\"en\"\nleon@leon-Desktop:~$ cat ~/.pam_environment\ncat: /home/leon/.pam_environment: No such file or directory\nleon@leon-Desktop:~$ sudo apt-get update\nИгн http://mirror.anl.gov utopic InRelease\n\n    ...\nEDIT 2:\nIt looks like ~/.kde/env/setlocale.sh was the culperate.

For such applications it overrides whatever locale names are set in \n\"LANG\" and \"LC_MESSAGES\".\n\nUnlike \"LANG\" and \"LC_*\", \"LANGUAGE\" should not be assigned a complete locale name \nincluding the encoding part (e.g. \".UTF-8\"). Instead \"LANGUAGE\" should contain a \ncolon separated priority list of language codes, for instance \"es:de:en\". A single \nlanguage code is also correct.\n\nAs lame as a link answer is, this is probably what you want.\nThe post referenced in the link above explains that if you want to change the language that appears on the command-line then you need to set both LANG and LANGUAGE accordingly in either /etc/default/locale or ~/.pam_environment.\nSince you've already tried setting LANGUAGE in /etc/default/locale, I'd try setting it in ~/.pam_environment since that's a user config file and its contents should overwrite anything set in the global environment.\nEDIT:\nI went ahead and tried duplicating the problem that you described by setting LANGUAGE in /etc/default/locale to \"en:ru:en\" logging out and then logging back in.  It worked.  Error messages were then displayed in Russian, at least for the root account (which was the account I was testing this on).  Changing the value of LANGUAGE to \"en\" fixed it.\n\nA: In case someone else is looking for the answer in the 2020s, the LANGUAGE environment variable is now set in ~/.config/plasma-localerc\n\nA: It sounds like you have the LANGUAGE variable set to ru:en or something in /etc/default/locale, so try to change it there to just en.\nThe answer, which Alexej Magura wrote, also mentions ~/.pam_environment.

They will be mounted nevertheless.\nYou can see which devices are currently in the blacklist by running the command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\n\nForce temporarily blacklisting\nTo automatically remove blacklisted devices from the blacklist, once they are unmounted, you can run a small script in the background. It watches changes in the list of mounted volumes. If a device gets disconnected, the script removes its (possible) mention in the blacklist. \nThe device will then appear again in the launcher on the next time it is connected.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file (use e.g. gedit).\n\n*Save the file somewhere as rm_blacklist.py.\n\n*For a clean start, reset the blacklist with the command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"[]\"\n\n\n*Test- drive the script by opening a terminal window and run the command:\npython3 /path/to/rm_blacklist.py\n\nWhile keeping the terminal window open (running the script):\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a pen drive. Wait a few seconds until it is mounted, then unlock it from the launcher\n\n*Disconnect the pen drive.\n\n*Insert it again after a few seconds; it should now re-appear in the launcher.\n\n\n\nIf all works as you want, add it to your Startup Applications:\nDash > \"Startup Applications\" > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/rm_blacklist.py\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\ndef get_info(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef get_mountedlist():\n    devices = get_info(\"lsblk\").splitlines()\n    return [l.split(\"/\")[-1].strip() for l in devices if \"/\" in l and not l.endswith(\"/\")]\n\ndef get_blacklist():\n    try:\n        return eval(get_info(\"gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\"))\n    except SyntaxError:\n        return []\n\nwhile True:\n    curr_blacklist = get_blacklist()\n    mounted_blacklisted = sum([[it for it in curr_blacklist if m in it] for m in get_mountedlist() ], [])\n    if '-' in curr_blacklist:\n        mounted_blacklisted = mounted_blacklisted+['-']\n    if not curr_blacklist == mounted_blacklisted:\n        cmd = \"gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"+'\"'+str(mounted_blacklisted)+'\"'\n        subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n    time.sleep(3)\n\n", "Q: Samsung netbook n-130 webcam driver in ubuntu 14.04 There is no driver for my Samsung netbook n-130 webcam.

Evince does fill forms but only offline, and adobe reader works with firefox online but it is not Open source.\nI am looking for a alternative software that is open source and can fill pdf forms online.\nNote that unlike Is there any useful software for filling out pdf-forms other than Adobe Reader? and Is there software that can fill PDF forms? question, I am specifically mentioning online forms. Also, I use Firefox mostly, but I don't have any problem in using any other browser.\n\nA: No matter what you do, if you have a PDF form, and you want to fill it out, it will be downloaded in any case; otherwise, PDF would have to be interpreted and presented to the user on the server (this is, in fact, the case if the LiveCycle Forms Server is used on server side, and it would serve HTML5 (nowadays) if you access it via a web browser.\nSo, the answer is no, there is none (but I will stand corrected if there is). If you insist on filling the form within a web browser, you better stay with Adobe Reader and the Firefox plug-in. You have the best possible functionality, and you will not have problems with smart forms.\n\nA: Firefox's mozilla/pdf.js now supports XFA forms. It would be available in Firefox 91 onwards.\nIf you want to use it right now,\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Firefox Nightly appimage.\n\n*Open about:config and set pdfjs.enableXfa preference to true.\n\n", "Q: Integrated graphics shows shimmering display Dear Linux enthusiast,\nWhen I boot Ubuntu, and the current GPU is set to the integrated graphics (ie an Intel HD 4600), the display shimmers sideways like old CRTs used to sometimes. Individual lines randomly shimmer back and forward horizontally about 2 or 3 pixels. It's still readable, but tiring on the eyes. And definitely wrong.\nIf I change the current GPU to the discrete GPU (ie an NVIDIA GTX 980M 8GB vram), and reboot in Linux, the display looks fine.\nDetails of my system:\nIt's a new laptop, an MSI GT72 2QE. The integrated graphics is Intel HD 4600, the discrete GPU is a GTX 980M 8GB vram.\nI have installed Windows 7 Pro (64bit) on the fist mSATA, and Ubuntu Desktop 64bit V14.04.1 LTS on the second mSATA. These mSATA drives are now (obviously) not in raid configuration. I have taken the boot settings back from UEFI to MBR. I've installed Grub2 and the system dual boots fine.\nThere is a button on the laptop that (under Windows) can explicitly switch between the integrated GPU and the discrete GPU, and this requires a reboot.\nWindows 7 shows no problems I can see with either GPU (apart from the usual Windows problems :-)\nThe only problem I have seen with Ubuntu is the shimmering display on the integrated GPU as described at the top. I would like to be able to use Linux with the integrated GPU because I will rarely need powerful graphics in Linux.\nOne other point is that the integrated graphics was selected when I did the Ubuntu install. The shimmering was evident right through the install and afterwards when it booted from the mSATA drive.\nThanks very much,\nPeter Bruderlin\n\nA: must be something wrong with the card or the install. i have the GT72 with the 970m and it works fine under Ubuntu using the Intel graphics. im running 14.10 though. maybe try the Intel Graphics Installer for Linux. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 + Gnome 3.10 = cannot open settings I've encountered a problem.

This leads to applications hanging, if they access those shares (like shell sessions in those directories, filemanagers with an open tab there, etc). Their processes get stuck in the dreadful uninterruptible state.\nThe kernel log says: kernel: CIFS VFS: Server  has not responded in 120 seconds. Reconnecting...\nQuestion: How can I reduce that timeout so that I don't have to spend 2+ minutes on coffee each time I switch to/from the docking station because all my applications hang?\nMore details:\n\n*\n\n*Both interfaces have different IPs on the same subnet and can obviously both reach the file-server\n\n*sample /etc/fstab line:\n\n\n//server/install              /mnt/net/install        cifs    uid=bob,credentials=/etc/cifs-credentials,_netdev,user,soft   0 0\n\n\n*\n\n*sample output from mount | grep cifs:\n\n\n//server/install on /mnt/net/install type cifs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,vers=1.0,cache=strict,username=bob,domain=bobsdom,uid=1000,forceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=[serverIP],unix,posixpaths,serverino,acl,rsize=1048576,wsize=65536,actimeo=1,_netdev,user)\n\nWhat I tried:\n\n*\n\n*The \"soft\" and \"hard\" mount options. They do not change that behaviour, even though the man page's text on \"soft\" suggests that\n\n*Made sure there is no packet loss on either interface and latency and bandwidth are excellent (GBit ethernet and 802.11ac wifi with strong signal). This makes me sure it's really a cifs timeout because of the IP change.\n\n*The server (samba 3.6) is having no network issues and no packet loss either.\n\n*Googled for a knob in cifs to reduce the timeout to something sensible like 15sec. Only found one for Windows. It's called HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\SessTimeout and is exactly what I want. Interestingly MS reduced this timeout in Win 8.1 to 20sec as well ...\n\n*Using route metrics instead of turning on/off wifi to have both routes up and let the kernel just prefer the ethernet route. This approach is flawed though, because then the kernel send replies to packets arriving via wireless out on the wired interface. Could be solved with some \"ip rule\" magic but I'd really prefer to just toggle the wifi radio.\n\n\nA: One working solution is to set both interfaces to the same static IP address. That  way cifs doesn't timeout, because it doesn't have to re-establish the connection from a different IP on the same subnet.\nThis also means that SSH connections are kept alive during wired<=>wifi switches without needing fancy tools like Mosh.\nIt has drawbacks, too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Requires static IP addresses instead of DHCP\n\n*IP conflict if my both interfaces where up simultaneously.

On Ubuntu Server guest OSes, it does not even mount the virtual CD within the guest system.\nAlternatively, you can download the ISO straight into the guest system from the repository, using\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso\n\nOnce you have made the ISO available by one of the above methods, you must mount it somewhere in the filesystem. I am going to assume you want to use mountpoint /mnt for that, but you can create a different mountpoint if you wish.\nIf you inserted the ISO image as a virtual CD:\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt\n\nIf you installed the guest additions ISO package from inside Ubuntu:\nsudo mount /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso /mnt\n\nFinally, navigate to the mount point and run the installer:\ncd /mnt\n\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\n", "Q: Boot-repair Boot Info: dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu I cannot boot Ubuntu installed alongside with Windows 8.1 on my laptop with UEFI (Sony SVP1322R4RBI). \nI followed the instructions on dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu, tried Boot-Repair with «recommended repair», then I manually set {bootmgr} option using Windows bcdedit, both\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nand\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nBut there is no any effect, the laptop boots directly into Windows. \nHere is the report of Boot-Repair http://paste.ubuntu.com/9616775/\nMaybe some advanced options would be helpful...\nUPDATE 01\nHere is my UEFI BIOS screens: link to dropbox (I cannot post images)\nI've tried all F-keys, but I can't load boot menu.\nSolved\nI've renamed grubx64.efi into EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi, now everything is ok!

As I understand it, some models of Sony VAIO use only the bootx64.efi boot loader.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I used to dual-boot and I enabled the windows bootloader to start when pressing F12(you can change this in the BIOS of your PC). I then pressed F12(you PC probably has a different F command) and chose to boot Ubuntu.\nDownsides to this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows will still boot automatically unless you press the F command when booting.\n\n*Start up time for either OS will be slowed Down by the whole process\n\n\nA: Ok. I've been looking at your Pastebin from Boot Repair, and here's what it looks like to me:\nYou've got all your partitions listed there, and it's listed which ones contain bootloaders.\n/dev/sda1 seems to contain your Windows bootloaders and a secureboot handler /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi for Ubuntu. I believe there should also be a grubx64.efi in the same directory as shimx64.efi, though, or it won't hand-off correctly.\n/dev/sda3 looks like it contains Windows bootloaders and properly configured secure boot bootloaders for Ubuntu.\n/dev/sda7 looks like it contains a traditional GRUB2 bootloader (and your Ubuntu installation). If you reboot and open up your EFI configuration tool at startup (just press whatever key the splash screen lists for \"setup\" or \"configuration utility\" before that boot splash screen disappears) and tell EFI to boot from one of the two partitions that have GRUB2 installed on it. I would choose the one installed on /dev/sda7, personally.\nIf Secure Boot isn't already disabled, I'd disable it. You say in another comment that you have found the option for that.\nYou may also need to change some settings to tell it to boot from that partition by default, depending on how your EFI setup utility behaves.  If you set it to boot from GRUB2 by default, you should be able to use GRUB2 to choose which OS to boot from in future rather than having to use EFI. (The grub.cfg file reproduced in your pastebin looks like it does contain the entries for booting Windows by handing off to the Windows bootloader.)\nIf your EFI doesn't provide you with options of which device to boot in the setup (which it typically does do, so I'd be kind of shocked if it didn't give you an option anywhere to configure which device to boot from), there may just be a different key you need to press on the boot splash screen to get the boot device/partition options to appear.\nIf you can't find these options, perhaps you could provide some images of your boot screen and EFI setup utilities so we could look at them and see if we can spot the setting you need?\nThere is another option that may be worth pursing if we can't get this to work: properly installing GRUB2 to /dev/sda1 where the Windows bootloader lives. I would consider using partimage or dd to make an image of the partition, first, though. Then, if something went horribly wrong, you'd be able to restore the partition to its original state.\n", "Q: How can I log in to my computer? Help!

Default is 1.0.\n;brightness=0.9\n; It is also possible to use different settings for day and night\n; since version 1.8.\n;brightness-day=0.7\n;brightness-night=0.4\n; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel\n; individually)\ngamma=0.8\n;gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8\n; This can also be set individually for day and night since\n; version 1.10.\n;gamma-day=0.8:0.7:0.8\n;gamma-night=0.6\n\n; Set the location-provider: 'geoclue', 'geoclue2', 'manual'\n; type 'redshift -l list' to see possible values.\n; The location provider settings are in a different section.\nlocation-provider=manual\n\n; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode'\n; type 'redshift -m list' to see all possible values.\n; 'randr' is the preferred method, 'vidmode' is an older API.\n; but works in some cases when 'randr' does not.\n; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.\nadjustment-method=randr\n\n; Configuration of the location-provider:\n; type 'redshift -l PROVIDER:help' to see the settings.\n; ex: 'redshift -l manual:help'\n; Keep in mind that longitudes west of Greenwich (e.g. the Americas)\n; are negative numbers.\n[manual]\nlat=48.1\nlon=11.6\n\n; Configuration of the adjustment-method\n; type 'redshift -m METHOD:help' to see the settings.\n; ex: 'redshift -m randr:help'\n; In this example, randr is configured to adjust screen 1.\n; Note that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually the\n; second screen. If this option is not specified, Redshift will try\n; to adjust _all_ screens.\n[randr]\nscreen=1\n\n\nAnother sample configuration also found at Ubuntu Documentation.\n\nA: Redshift GTK (and normal redshift) can be run with options to specify how it is run:\n redshift-gtk -l 52.6:1.6 -t 5700:3500 -g 0.82 -m randr -v\n\nIn the above command these commands are used:\n\n\n*\n\n*-l specifies your locations rough coordinates, so it can sync with sunrise/sunset. Usually redshift-gtk tries looking up your location but this won't work unles your computer has GPS so it easier to set manually, using a mapping service to give a approximation of your location (e.g. with with OpenStreetMap)\n\n*-t sets the color temperature of the screen, for day and for night respectively. \n\n*-g sets the gamma correction apply\n\n*-m the method to use. This will likely depend on your desktop compositor. \n\n*-b can also be used to set screen brightness (also DAY:NIGHT, with values between .1 & 1.\n\n\nThis works largely the same as redshift (and uses pretty much the same options as in man redshift), except it runs with a icon so you can turn it off with switching to terminal. You can run the above command in a terminal, your desktops command launcher (usually Alt+F2), or even create a launcher.\nOtherwise it may be better to use a configuration file as in @Mahmudul Hasan Shohag's answer.\n\nA: Using Debian 10 (KDE), I solved the \"1 second issue\" going to:\nSystem Settings > Startup and Shutdown > Autostart > double-click on Redshift > Application > Change \"Command:\" line \"redshift-gtk\" to \"redshift -O 3700\" (without quotes)\nThat changed the temperature permanently.\n", "Q: How to lower refresh rate on external display (projector) from 75 hz to 60 hz I have a projector that is 3D Ready, but it can only handle a refresh rate of 60 Hz to use the 3D settings, yet for some reason it defaults to 75 Hz when I plug it in through the HDMI port (the only video out on my laptop) and I cannot figure out how to change it. I have easily been able to use the 3D settings on my Mac so I know it works. I'm not so great at the terminal but I'm not afraid to use it if you can give me clear steps. Of course, it would be great if it could \"remember\" the refresh rate when I plug it in, but I would settle for having to remind it each time I plug it in.\n\nA: Is there a setting for the display in the GUI Settings / Display? There should be (at least used to be) options to change the refresh there.\nOr in a terminal using xrandr -r 60 should work (might need to use --output ... (maybe --output HDMI-0?) or --screen ... before. Try just xrandr to see what it tells you are available modes & info.\n", "Q: Recover from improper setup of backup drive using Label//UUID Objective: Set up home multi-system (Mac, perhaps Win7, and other Ubuntus) backup capability using Seagate Backup Plus 3T drive connected to Ubuntu Studio 14.04. I would like to simplify the drive name and use the preferred (?) UUID/Labels to do so (to preclude changes in /sdx when I add/remove other external drives and reboot).\nApproach: rsnapshot and rsync per Jeff Skinner's example.\nHowever, I formatted the drive as exfat (for multi-OS purposes), and sought to use Labels for the drive (calling it \"BackupDrive\")\nIssue: I somehow ended up setting up a mount at sdd1 of /mnt/backupdrive as well as a mount at sdf1 with the label BackupDrive\nFrom mount:\n/dev/sdd1 on /mnt/backupdrive type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sdf1 on /media/will/BackupDrive type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\nFrom blkid;\n/dev/sdf1: LABEL=\"BackupDrive\" UUID=\"5053-2D7E\" TYPE=\"exfat\"\n(there is no /dev/sdd1)\n\nThe only thing on the drive are standard Seagate files and some empty directories (e.g., no risk in losing data).\nI can ls the files in /mnt/backupdrive and see the above files/directories.\nIt shows up on Nemo as BackupDrive though with no files or directories.\nI have no real information on this backup drive yet \nQuestion: How do I correct this to mount by UUID (or Label), so I can continue working my backup solution?\nOnce fixed, for rebooting purposes should I use; \nsudo rm /etc/fstab.pre-uuid\nsudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/volumeid.postinst configure\nUPDATE: @Xen2050 - fstab has the following;\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--studio--vg-root /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n#\" /boot was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=5cade5c2-bd38-4d2b-aecb-b703ac671bc3 /boot           ext2    defaults        0       2\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--studio--vg-swap_1 none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nThe UUID for the BackupDrive in blkid and gparted is 5053-2D7E\nThe UUID 5cade5c2-bd38-4d2b-aecb-b703ac671bc3 is associated with the sda1 boot partition\nUPDATE 2: Followed the suggestion of @xen2050 and added the following to fstab;\nUUID=\"5053-2D7E\" /media/will/BackupDrive  fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nRebooted, and it complained that there was a mount issue. I skipped the manual configuration during boot.\nHere's what mount showed;\n/dev/sdc1 on /media/will/BackupDrive1 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nblkid showed;\n/dev/sdc1: LABEL=\"BackupDrive\" UUID=\"5053-2D7E\" TYPE=\"exfat\" \n\nNo existing files were shown in Nemo, though I copied a backup of the previous contents, and the drive shows them as resident there now.  I don't understand why there is a BackupDrive1 showing up under mount\n\nWill this work or am I still not out of the woods?\n\nA: I think your directions (pasted from the Ubuntu uuid page) are outdated:\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake LTS, you can use these commands to \"upgrade\" to UUIDs. All other supported versions of Ubuntu automatically use UUIDs, so this is not necessary.\n\nWhat's your /etc/fstab look like now? You can probably just change the \"/dev/sd..\" names to \"UUID=...\" in there and that's about it, like in the fstab help page. I think mount always reports what /dev device is mounted...\n... saw updated fstab. I'm not too familiar with the \"fuseblk\" type, I've seen it before used with encryption but not in mount's output... but if it works that's good enough. The one says it's type \"exfat\" so maybe replacing fuseblk with exfat would work, or even auto...\nSo now the drive(s) get mounted with:\n/dev/sdd1 on /mnt/backupdrive type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sdf1 on /media/will/BackupDrive type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nSo I think putting these into fstab should work for the sdf one:\nUUID=\"5053-2D7E\" /media/will/BackupDrive  fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n\nNot sure about the sdd1 one, if blkid didn't see it...? Tried sudo blkid? Or there's only the one drive isn't there? Unplugging it could give it a different sdx \"name\"... so maybe that's what happened there to get the 2 different entries?\n", "Q: How to run an application on a sandbox? I'm interested in running Skype on a sandbox. I don't want to use a virtual-machine however, since it's overkill just for a program.\nI don't need Skype's video or voice capabilities to work, chat only is ok.\nSo ya, how do I run Skype in a sandbox? \n\nA: In fact, a whole VM just for Skype would be a good sandbox. \nThe greatest sandbox that you could get is to use another computer.\nIf you don't want to use any of the methods mentioned, you still have another choice but I wouldn't call it \"sandboxed\" even when it is a good security step.\nIf you're running over an admin account, you may consider running it over a less privileged user different than yours. For instance if you create the user foo, you can start Skype by doing:\nsudo -u foo -H skype\n\nBy default the user foo doesn't have access to the X display.

But just in case I'd try data recovery first before doing any write tests to the drive.\nWhen you boot from a live iso (USB/CD) if you can paste the mount errors (from the terminal, or probably in /dev/log/syslog too) that should help a lot.\nMounting read-only (ro) might allow access to copy off your data files at least, if you don't have a backup already.  This should work if you're booting live:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out which drive partition you'd like to mount (the /dev/sdx# name).  In a terminal, run (as root or with sudo) some of these to find out what device/partition (like /dev/sda1) you're after. The linux partitions are probably an ext3/4 format, windows usually NTFS:  \nlsblk or blkid or fdisk -l or parted -l \n\n*Make a mountpoint sudo mkdir /mountpoint (for example, often the're in /media/ somewhere, may work better in there). \n\n*Try mounting it read-only with the device & mountpoint from earlier  \nmount -o ro /dev/sdx# /mountpoint\nWatch for any error messages here. If it mounted ok you should be able to read & copy your data from /mountpoint \nIt may need a filesystem check before it wants to mount (see man fsck & the other tools like fsck.ext3, fsck.<morenames>). But those could write to the filesystem, possibly overwriting your data you'd like to recover first, so that wouldn't be a \"best practice\" of data recovery. \nIf it wouldn't mount, other tools like testdisk or photorec could be used to try & read the data anyway. See this Ubuntu Data recovery page, or the testdisk or photorec documentation/help for more info.\n\nAnd with \"mount: ... failed: invalid argument\" you might want to take a look at your /etc/fstab file... maybe edit that into your Q?\nOr a tool like Boot Repair could help for GRUB boot problems, but that may not be the problem here (could even mess up Windows booting which still works now).\n", "Q: Moving Linux from USB drive to internal sata drive I presently am running WinXP from my primary internal SATA drive, and Ubuntu 14.04\nfrom an external USB drive. I have installed a new internal SATA secondary hard drive.\nIs it possible to MOVE or COPY my USB drive's contents to the secondary internal\ndrive, OR should I simply reinstall Linux from scratch onto the internal drive, run\nupdates, and then copy my home directory from USB to the internal drive ? [I am\nplanning to dual boot on the two internal drives by having Linux replace the primary \ndrive's MBR with GRUB.]\n\nA: You should be able to move your file system off usb with rsync. \nBoot into Ubuntu as you normally would (off of USB) and then mount your new SATA drive that you intend to move Ubuntu to.\nsudo mount /dev/xxx /mnt\n\nonce the device is mounted you can then copy everything over\nsudo rsync -axv / /mnt\n\nThat will copy your file system off of USB and onto your new drive. As far as setting up grub and what not, unfortunately I cannot help you there.\nDisclaimer: I have not done this before as you are asking, but I do use this method to move the file system off of the SD Card of my Raspberry Pi and onto USB.\n\nA: It is totally possible.  What will vary is what lengths you are willing to go to in order to protect your windows drive from possible erasure.  My plain-english solution below may not look very geeky, and it may seem more difficult but it will protect your installations from harm.\nThe following instructions are IMO the best way to do what you say you want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using your external ubuntu installion, download and burn clonezilla to bootable media (cd or flash)\n\n*Using your external ubuntu installion, download and burn Boot Repair to bootable media (cd or flash)\n\n*OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED turn off your pc, disconnect power, and disconnect your internal windows drive entirely, (power or data wires are sufficient)\n\n*Boot your computer to clonezilla and use its menus to copy the external usb installation of Ubuntu to your intended drive.\n\n*Turn off your PC, reconnect your windows drive, and attempt to boot your PC.  You will probably see a grub menu, and if you do, you are done, but if not, shut down your pc and reboot your computer, this time to your boot repair menu I had you repair earlier.  Let it work its magic.  Then shut it down, remove boot repair, and reboot.\n\n\nThe following instructions explain how to do something still better and safer:\nIn my opinion, dual boot installations are just plain unsafe.  For this reason I would advise you to purchase a hard drive tray system, assuming of course that this is a desktop and not one of those laptops with two hard drive bays, and literally swap hard drives depending upon which operating system you wish to use.\nhard drive tray systems come in all flavors, ide and sata, and can be purchased for under $20.  I would be happy to make recommendations.\n", "Q: Cisco AnyConnect VPN, install issue, vpnui not executing I was able to install Cisco VPN AnyConnect client with no issue in Linux Mint 17.

You can choose Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS or 14.10 based on your choice. For people who feel stability is top priority, LTS (Long Term Support) versions are recommended. \nYour laptop is not on the list (per say, so isn't mine). I think your X550LB should work fine with Ubuntu. Installation procedure can be viewed here. \nIf you doubt it, then use UnetBootin and run Ubuntu from USB for trial and test everything like wifi, sound, battery backup hours, heating, bluetooth, file transfer, trackpad check etc. This will make you feel more confidant. \nAfter installation, follow these instructions to turn it into a productive system.\n\nA: I've owned three asus netbooks and five asus desktop motherboards.  Asus appears committed to Linux and with it Ubuntu as well.  I don't feel I'd be going out on a limb to say you have nothing to worry about.  All that I would suggest is to make sure to have your computer connected to the internet with an ethernet connection during the installation so that it can download and drivers it needs during the installation.\n", "Q: Is there any way to create thumbnails in the Trash folder?

Unfortunately, I soon found out that I couldn't attempt to install the 64 bit Ubuntu 14.10 version from the Linux Format Christmas 2014 issue, because at least 2 GB RAM is required, but his PC only has 1 GB RAM.\nI have now failed in my first installation attempt, because I was required to burn an ISO image onto a DVD, but there are no blank DVDs here. I've got a USB memory stick, but I don't know if or how I can use that instead.\nAt the moment, I've got a live version of Fedora Linux installed onto the USB stick and have managed to boot my friend's Dell Dimension desktop PC from that stick.\nWhat should I try next to try and install Ubuntu onto this PC?\n\nThanks for all your suggestions. Today (Sunday) I'll see if I can buy a blank DVD or even a blank CD from anywhere. I'll also wipe Fedora Linux live version from my USB memory stick then try to burn an ISO image onto that for installation. I read on the Linux Format magazine Christmas DVD that I could install an image onto a USB stick using something called dd , but unfortunately I've never even heard of dd before, let alone used it. The main thing is that I've now got about 24 hours left to install Linux onto my friend's PC. I've only been here once before, 16 months ago, and I don't know if or when I'll ever come back. I mentioned in the title that he's technophobic, which is actually a bit of an understatement. He is totally incapable of installing any extra RAM, or unplugging or installing a hard drive, and he couldn't even tell me which version of Windows he was running. I told him that it must display the version on the monitor when he boots up or closes down, but while I've been here I've seen he leaves the PC turned on all day. I found out which version of Windows it was when the screen saver was displayed. To sum up, unless I install Linux for him, then he will never be able to install it. It took me 5 days to get onto his WiFi network, because the hub/router with the password printed on it was buried somewhere in the room. I also wanted to show him my Raspberry Pi computer which I use a phono to SCART cable with, but he claims that if I plugged it into his TV it would blow up. There is no other TV here which is working and has a SCART socket. I haven't got round to buying an HDMI to VGA cable for it yet. This costs about £6 on eBay, but about £45 in Maplins. Even if I had one, I doubt I could unplug the monitor cable from the PC and connect it, because the room is in such a mess. I hope someone can make a few more suggestions in the light of all this.\n\nA: *\n\n*Download uNetbootin\n\n*Download the ISO of 32-bit (because the PC have less than 2GB of RAM)\n\n*Use uNetbootin to burn the ISO on the USB.\n\n*Go to the BIOS of your friend computer and select to start by USB.\n\n*Do the installation.\n\n\nHope that it solved your problem. Sorry for bad English\n\nA: Your intentions are good but your timing is bad, so while you can help him immensely, you can do it retroactively and mail him the result for less than a dollar of shipping.  I know this for certain as I have done it several times.\nFor now, the previous commenter is correct.  You need to help him order RAM online and maybe you can even show him how it installs using youtube videos and tools you may have with you during your visit.  In so much as most desktops have as many as four memory slots, it would be wise to open the pc anyway to determine the best fit.  You really only need to get him to 2gb, but of course 4 would be nicer if he can afford it.\nAfter you get home take one of your computers which you can disconnect the internal hard drive from, then install Ubuntu (I recommend 32bit over 64bit for reasons I'll explain later if pressed).  With your hard drive disconnected, install the ubuntu of your choice to a particularly fast variety of SOLID STATE USB storage.  I'm particularly fond of the thumbdrive shaped PATRIOT RAGE PRO XT which you can buy in such sizes as 32, 64 and 128, but it really doesn't cost that much more to buy this tiny shirt-pocket sized mSATA adapter and an mSATA card (I recommend this brand) to put inside it.  With this combination it is actually faster than most internal hard drives.\nThis external installation will not only permit your friend to boot his desktop from this device, but any other computer he happens to be near.  I carry such a device with me at all times and love the freedom.\nAlternately of course, you can give him these instructions and he can more easily disconnect his internal hard drive to do the external installation but naturally he won't be as expert as yourself and he'll be completely flummoxed when trying to install stuff like WINE which I would advise you to preinstall for him as I do for my friends.\nHaving only just learned that your laptop's usb ports are broken, I wish to alert you to possible solutions, not the least of which would be cardbus variety cards which your laptop might accept which would supplement your existing ports.  Another option which may work for you is a near magical product with which I've fixed numerous usb ports in seconds.  It is called DeOxit by CAIG.  You can find it online and sometimes they offer free samples if you hunt around their site enough.  If you reply with the model number of your laptop, I may have a third no cost solution.  Amazon also sells it.\n\nA: 1GB should be enough for at least Xubuntu (or Linux Mint XFCE), but there are \"lighter\" option distros if you're interested. One using LXDE like Lubuntu or Lubuntu-LTS based LXLE (oddly only 64-bit in the new version). CrunchBang was great last time I saw it, or for very very tiny options there's Puppy or TinyCore (not as \"friendly\" as the Ubuntu-Debian-based ones).

Basically install grub onto the USB, copy one (or a few) iso's onto it, then edit a grub.cfg file to boot an iso. See this answer for more instructions, or this page for even more instructions.\n\nA: I would suggest you Try Xubuntu or Lubuntu as they are better for 1GB RAM.

This is the device I am currently using. On this device I have XFCE4 installed. I installed Ubuntu software center so that I may in turn get software. I did so using the apt-get install command. It runs fine, It's just that when I select a software I would like to install nothing happens. Even after repeatedly clicking, nothing happens. I am only allowed to get certain software from the apt-get install command in the terminal, and sometimes some of that software isn't installed correctly. I would really like a solution to this problem.\n\nA: Don't blame Ubuntu!  I too have an acer chromebook.  It is stored elsewhere or I'd rattle off my model number to you.\nLike you I did the sideways Ubuntu installation through terminal so that I can have Ubuntu and Chrome essentially running concurrently, accessible via some key combination, something like ctrl-alt 1 or 2 or something.  It works remarkably well but I've proven it to have certain limitations.\nFor one thing I discovered that even though I was sort of able to install WINE, it would not actually run.  I suspect that if Chrubuntu were installed in place of chrome, it would work but sharing the chrome kernel, it would not.  Trust me, I tried very very hard.\nRealizing as I do that the type of Ubuntu we have installed is sharing a non Ubuntu kernel essentially owned by a manufacturer which appears to be in competition with microsoft, and to a lesser degree, other linux derived operating systems, it is not remotely surprising that Google chose to curtail our freedoms a bit.  \n", "Q: I have files in a usb drive that would not delete and the terminal is not working nor accepting my password in ubuntu 14.04 I have jpeg, jpg and html files in a USB drive that I want to erase and I can't.

In UEFI, the partition marked with the boot flag is the location of the bootloaders. Then with a tool like efibootmgr, you can set the paths to bootloaders and their bootorder.  \n\n*It doesn't boot in UEFI mode because you have no bootloaders in the EFI partition.\n\n\nApparently you have switched to compatibility mode, putting a grub into the MBR, so that should work, but I have no experience with CSM on new machines.

Tried to report as per https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/report-ubuntu-bug.html but after \"Collecting problem information\", it just leads to \"The problem cannot be reported. The report belongs to a package which is not installed.\" So here I am at askubuntu. This was my first time using 'ubuntu-bug', and I was unclear on the correct syntax for the program name, like, case sensitive? space between words, or no space? Either way, I figure I did it right given that \"Collecting problem information\" launched.\nBug: In Image Viewer, with an image displayed in \"fit to screen\" size, I left-clicked turning the mouse pointer into a closed-hand 'grabber', and tried to drag the image a bit. The image doesn't move of course, as the whole thing is already displayed. But then releasing the mouse button, the pointer remained like a little thumbnail of the image, but only the lower half. The upper half was 2 pointer arrows, side by side. I could not undo this and get a normal pointer again, until after reboot. Before that, I tried closing Image Viewer, then closing all other programs, then looking at Settings>Mouse... nothing would recover my pointer back to normal, until reboot. I've reproduced this problem 4 times now, needing 4 reboots.\nNotably, when viewing an image in full-size where it exceeds the screen res, the grab & drag function works properly- pointer returns to normal after releasing mouse button. \nAs an unannounced 2-fer here, I'll also note that \"Cheese Webcam Booth\" would not open at all, resulting in an error message. Trying the same 'ubuntu-bug' report process above resulted in the same \"The problem cannot be reported. The report belongs to a package which is not installed\" message.

In regards to the huge log files, you can simply grab the important debug lines, like the one you mentioned and remove the files before they eat your space. 10GB log files is too much. I am guessing you are a Desktop user and not a server. In the case of the server, I would further analyze what errors the log is giving you and find answers to each specific problem.\nIn regards to the Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT I would again, check with memtest first, and then check your BIOS or UEFI to see what options could make this happened (Like virtual technology enabled/disabled, memory settings, cpu tunning and more)\nNormally I find that it is either a bad memory on the computer or a misconfigured BIOS setting.\n", "Q: Drive isn't recognized So that few days I've been trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my external hdd (I have two and have tried installing on both of the them).

I just want to have a working Ubuntu hard drive.\n\nA: It sounds like you installed Ubuntu on the external HDD but installed the boot-loader on the internal SSD.  When you boot back into Ubuntu using the live CD and attempt to install, what options are you picking?\n\nA: My guess is that the GRUB is installed on the internal SSD and is configured to look for the drive which it isn't recognizing but for whatever reason ins't finding it.  Ironically this is related to a subject I was discussing with another user in just the past few hour.\nInstalling Ubuntu on EXTERNAL media is fun and practical, a my own bio explains, but for it to work right, it is best that it be the only drive connected when setting it up, otherwise what happens is what you are experiencing.\nFirst, to fix your internal SSD, please download and burn this boot repair disk/flash.\nUse the boot repair to boot the computer with only the internal SSD connected and us its boot repair utility to automatically fix its grub.\nNext, if you want your newly created external drives to be independently bootable, you can use the boot repair disk to fix them, but for each one they need to be the only drive in the system when the boot repair is being made.  After each drive is repaired, you will (probably) be able to boot your computer to the external drives, even with the SSD still attached.\n", "Q: How to check if MAAS-DHCP service/daemon is running?

I created a 'Portable Apps' directory under Home. I then right-clicked 'Minecraft.jar' and selected 'Make Link'.\nI then moved the \"shortcut\" to the desktop.\nWhen I try to launch Minecraft from that shortcut, I either get errors or Minecraft saves a whole bunch of random data files to the desktop.\nWhy can't Ubuntu create proper shortcuts like Windows? Why does it treat shortcuts like actual programs? Why isn't a \"Link\" a link? Why is it the actual program?\n\nA: The proper way to use a portable app like this under Ubuntu requires also creating a \"*.desktop\" file for its executable (which is \"Minecraft.jar\" in this case), and putting it in one of these folders: /usr/share/applications, /usr/local/share/applications, or /home/jay/.local/share/applications (which looks like the one you would prefer).\nIf you want a \"shortcut\" for this app on your desktop as well, you should simply copy that \"*.desktop\" file to your desktop. It's OK to create shortcuts for files, folders, and other places, but it's not advisable to do the same for apps in this case.\nHere's a sample file, which you might name as \"minecraft.desktop\", which is simply a plain text file given executable permissions.\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Minecraft\nComment=Java minecraft game\nExec=\"/home/jay/Portable Apps/Minecraft.jar\"\nIcon=\"/home/jay/Portable Apps/Minecraft.png\"\nCategories=Games;\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\n\nIt's assumed above that your user name is jay and you also have an icon file named \"Minecraft.png\", otherwise you should better have one.\n\nA: Does the original 'Minecraft.jar' work correctly? I'm thinking that maybe there is a problem in how Ubuntu is handling your .jar files. If that's the problem, read this thread.\nI have tried two methods to make desktop shortcuts: the right click → make link and right click → copy to.  I mostly use copy to for the executable files usually found on /usr/share/applications. I know that copy to doesn't really create a shortcut, but it does the job for me.\n", "Q: VLC Media Player not installing in ubuntu 14.04 I tried installing vlc media player by typing:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nThe terminal window showed the following error:\nSome packages could not be installed. \nThis may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the \nunstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nvlc : Depends: vlc-nox (= 2.1.4-0ubuntu14.04.1) but it is not going to be installed\n      Depends: libsdl-image1.2 (>= 1.2.10) but it is not installable\n      Depends: libtar0 but it is not installable\n      Depends: libva-x11-1 (> 1.3.0~) but it is not installable\n      Depends: libva1 (> 1.3.0~) but it is not installable\n      Depends: libvlccore7 (>= 2.1.0) but it is not going to be installed\nRecommends: vlc-plugin-notify (= 2.1.4-0ubuntu14.04.1) but it is not going to be installed\nRecommends: vlc-plugin-pulse (= 2.1.4-0ubuntu14.04.1) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: These commands might help you:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: What I am suggesting might be risky.

The reason I ask is, the windows boot manager will be in sda3, however, the ubuntu boot manager will not have installed to that partition, under which partition would it have installed?  My / partition? (that looks odd, but out of the three, \"/\" , \"/swap\" and \"/home\" that is the one I mean)  I'll need to mount both sda3 and the partition with ubuntu in order to copy grub over.  It has been years since I did any serious linux work and back then I used a sun system.\n\nA: When I had the same problem I used to press F2 and the windows boot manager allowed me to chose the Grub and then Ubuntu.

So I'd like to check if the solution are correct un my case.\nAnyway : I recently bought a new desktop (no manufacturer, just built from parts) for working purpose, I already have 1 SSD + 1 HDD with windows 8.1 on SSD and data on HDD. I would like to install a fresh ubuntu on a brand new SSD (MX100 256G). I want to use the full SSD for linux system + data and if possible be occasionally be able to access data on the data HDD.\nI already tried to do this a while ago with an HDD instead of the SSD, so I connected the HDD, launched ubuntu installer from live usb, an even though I asked the installer not to mess with the current UEFI, I actually did, and moreover the ubuntu install was extremely slow for some reason I don't understand. So I removed the hdd, and restored my windows system.\nHow can I achieve this properly ? Last time I installed linux distribution (long time ago), there were no UEFI, so I have no clue about how this works. From what I read, I think the most \"quick and dirty\" way would be to unplug the current drives, plug the new SSD, install ubuntu, then plug the other 2 and change the boot order. But after that, can I install a boot loader to choose the system I want to boot without entering the bios, or will this mess up my windows installation ?\nI'm aware that a lot of these questions have been already answered, but since I can't find an exact match, I'd just like to check if the different parts I read fit together correctly or not. Thanks\nEDIT : According to the comments, I'm not completely clear about what I want. I'm not looking for a tutorial on how to install ubuntu, but rather an answer about how to manage UEFI partitions and bootloader in order to get 2 SSD with 2 different operating systems to work properly. As I said, my first try failed.\n\nA: From what I understand, you want to have an SSD with both Ubuntu and Windows 8 on it and have an HDD for data. UEFI partitions and boot loaders are not very different from the traditional BIOS; infact, for UEFI booting, you still use the same bootloader you've probably been using: GRUB 2. First, you need to boot into Windows. Open Disk Management and use that to shrink your Windows partition. Don't let the Ubuntu installer do it for you (it could mess some stuff up). Then change your UEFI settings (it's technincally not a BIOS) and look for an option called SecureBoot. You want to disable that to work around a bug in GRUB 2 (it won't affect your Windows stuff, but if you get a message about having SecureBoot disabled you need some Windows updates). Then boot from your DVD or flash drive or whatever you're installing Ubuntu from and open the installer. Choose Something Else for partitioning. Now, whatever you do, do not make swap! Swap is very bad for SSDs. Create an ext4 filesystem in the free space and continue. Ignore warnings about swap (if you want you can create some swap on that hard drive of yours) and let it install. After it finishes installation, shutdown, put back in all of your drives. Change your UEFI settings after putting the drives back in and make sure Ubuntu is set to boot before Windows. Sometimes Windows updates will put Windows back at the top so if you ever boot straight into Windows just put Ubuntu at the top again. Boot into Ubuntu. I realize that it did not give you a choice to boot into Windows but this is normal  (for now). Open a Terminal and run sudo update-grub. Hopefully it will say it found Windows Boot Manager. Also, if you're using Ubuntu 14.10 (bad idea for servers!) skip this next part. If your SSD is made by a company other than Intel, SAMSUNG, OCZ, Patriot, or SanDisk, you need to run sed -i 's/exec fstrim-all/exec fstrim-all --no-model-check/g' /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim to enable TRIM. If you want to make a swap partition on your data drive install and load GParted and it will do it easy. Reboot and check that everything works. If it does then good for you. Here is some more information on optimizing Ubuntu for SSDs (14.04 is not as SSD-friendly as 14.10 but maybe an update will come out soon that will take care of that): How do I optimize the OS for SSDs?\n\nA: Try to install the Ubuntu from a virtual machine or others machine into the new SSD,then boot it from your Computer. Your machine will have two diffrent bootloader on a single machine.When you want to boot to an OS, do it from BIOS. i've tried it once on a machine with installed Windows 8.1 UEFI on it, but with HDD.\nAnd since you use Windows 8.

In case of a hard-drive failure – let's say I can solve all the booting issues – will I be able to put back all the files with all the symbolic links done right and their permissions / attributes?\nContext\nI am setting up an rsync backup system in which my NAS (arm processor) connects to my dedicated webserver hosted far far away and does a backup of the / partition. \nIn case of a disk crash, I plan on making the exact same partition setup on the new disk, on installing the same operating system (14.04) so I get the MBR / boot loader in place. \nThen I will rsync back the backup from the NAS to the server, reboot and cross my fingers.\nThe issue is that I will only know if everything works the day I need the backup…. But I can take measures to know if it will work before. One of them is checking that every single file, folder, sym link… in the backup has the same permissions, attributes, whatever than the original. I also need to check that the sym links and similar are correctly done.\nThe options I use with rsync are :\nrsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\"}\n\nThe option A is causing issues.\nEDIT: ADDITIONAL INFO\nWhat I am looking for is a working backup strategy that will allow me:\n– to perform blazing fast backups.\nBecause I do backup the / system partition, I take most services down on the server (apache, postfix, dovecot, mysql, etc.) so I can have a safe backup. Any solution such as rsync is good, because I can update a mirror directory on the NAS. Then, offline, I can take care of the backup strategy (incremental, etc…) from the updated mirror.\n– to have fast restore (I don't want to transfer a 100 GB disk image).\nI have a really really fast connection between the NAS and the server. I mean really fast. Transferring a 10 GB disk image is a matter of minutes.\nWhat I can't do: change the physical setup of the hosted server. I have one 500 GB disk. That's all.\nWhat I can do: boot the server in a rescue mode in which the disk isn't mounted at all. Rescue mode even works with a dead disk. I use this mode to perform binary images of partitions.\nCurrent setup:\n/     10 GB, 17 % full\nSWAP 512 Mo\n/var  80 GB\n/bkup the rest… to 500 GB.\n\nA: My experiment\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup\nAt first I created an Ext4 Partition on my PC using gparted.\nThen I booted into a small Arch GNU/Linux installation in the hope that this would bring a better performance. Then I attached my Raspberry Pi with a only a bit modified Raspbian GNU/Linux Installation via Ethernet switch to the PC.\nThen I mounted the Ext4 partition. \n\n\n*Copying\nAfter this I copied the / partition of the Pi to my PC.\nrsync -rlptgoDXvxzH --numeric-ids --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\"} root@raspberrypi:/ rsync_mount/\n\nThis took about 20 minutes. If you copy your server to your NAS you may need\n\n\n*\n\n*a flatrate (or a lot of money;) )\n\n*a lot of time\n\n\n*bricking the Raspberry Pi\nThen I bricked my Raspberry Pi using\nssh root@raspberrypi\n\nrm -r /run /var /etc /usr\n\nThen I had to unplug the power cable because nothing was working anymore.\n\n\n*repairing the Raspberry Pi\nFinally I plugged the SD-Card of the Rpi into my computer, mounted it and repaired it using\ncp -rpvxH  rsync_mount/* rpi_mount/\n\nafter unmounting the SD-Card and booting the Rpi everything worked fine again.\nFazit\nThe part with rsync worked fine, but I do not know if it will work with a complete new installation. Maybe then the kernel will not fit to what you copy back on the server.\nI will make another try, where I install a newer kernel version after rsyncing.\n\nA: What you're really asking is: What is a good Backup Strategy for my server and that depends what you want to do when the lightning hits your server...\nFor me, speedy restore is what I want, so what I do is:\nI have one additional small, old, cheap disk containing 2 additional partitions on the server: a 500GB ext4 partition containing the system back-ups and a  500MB FAT32 boot, diag partition (yep, MegaByte, and it's a bit too big!) containing CloneZilla.\nWhenever I'm going to do some drastic changes to the server or whenever I feel I can afford a 5 minute down-time, I boot the server into the FAT32 CloneZilla partition, which then backs up my root partition excluding \"/home\" in 5 minutes! (using disk-to-image)\nI've had to restore the image only once and it works like a charm: server was set back 1 month (as I wasn't sure when I introduced the problem), installed all its updates and then I had to redo my work from the last month which was basically installing a few utilities.\nIn addition to that, I rsync my /home and the system image backup partition weekly at Monday 03:00 am (which is when the server has its lowest usage).\nIf that's good enough for you, use the same strategy. \n", "Q: Which package provides the Postgresql init scipt?

It's not fully backwards-compatible. You should decrypt the data using the original version that encrypted it.\nOr, it's possible you're not using the right key for the filename encryption (fnek), double-check the key and look into the mount options ecryptfs_fnek_sig=(fnek_sig) and even ecryptfs_sig=(fekek_sig).\nHere are some mount -t ecryptfs options that look useful (from man ecryptfs):\necryptfs_sig=(fekek_sig)\n      Specify  the  signature  of the mount wide authentication token.\n      The authentication token must be in the  kernel  keyring  before\n      the  mount  is performed. ecryptfs-manager or the eCryptfs mount\n      helper can be used to construct the authentication token and add\n      it to the keyring prior to mounting.\n\necryptfs_fnek_sig=(fnek_sig)\n      Specify  the  signature  of  the mount wide authentication token\n      used for filename crypto. The authentication must be in the ker‐\n      nel keyring before mounting.\n\n ecryptfs_enable_filename_crypto=(y/n)\n      Specify whether filename encryption should be enabled.  If  not,\n      the  mount  helper  will  not  prompt  the user for the filename\n      encryption key signature (default).\n\n  verbosity=0/1\n      If verbosity=1, the mount helper will ask you for missing values\n      (default).  Otherwise, if verbosity=0, it will not ask for miss‐\n      ing values and will fail if required values are omitted.\n\n\nI think you will probably find the ecryptfs-recover-private tool a lot easier than manually specifying encryption & filename keys... if you have a \"regular\" encrypted folder it should work pretty good, pointing it at the encrypted drive's \".Private\" folder should work, maybe /home/username/.Data if that's it. \nHere's a paste from it's man page:\nNAME\n       ecryptfs-recover-private  - find and mount any encrypted private direc‐\n       tories\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       ecryptfs-recover-private [--rw] [encrypted private dir]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This utility is intended to  help  eCryptfs  recover  data  from  their\n       encrypted  home  or  encrypted private partitions.  It is useful to run\n       this from a LiveISO or a recovery image.  It must run under sudo(8)  or\n       with root permission, in order to search the filesystem and perform the\n       mounts.\n\n       The program can take a target encrypted directory on the command  line.\n       If  unspecified,  the utility will search the entire system looking for\n       encrypted private directories,  as  configured  by  ecryptfs-setup-pri‐\n       vate(1).\n\n       If  an encrypted directory and a wrapped-passphrase file are found, the\n       user is prompted for the login  (wrapping)  passphrase,  the  keys  are\n       inserted into the keyring, and the data is decrypted and mounted.\n\n       If  no  wrapped-passphrase file is found, the user will be prompted for\n       their mount passphrase.  This passphrase is typically 32 characters  of\n       [0-9a-f].  All users are prompted to urgently record this randomly gen‐\n       erated passphrase when they first setup their encrypted private  direc‐\n       tory.\n\n       The  destination  mount of the decrypted data is a temporary directory,\n       in the form of /tmp/ecryptfs.XXXXXXXX.\n\n       By default, the mount will be read-only.  To mount with read and  write\n       permission, add the --rw parameter.\n\n\nA: I've had the exact same behaviour and the problem was just that I didn't select the right source directory.\nHere's my disk's setup :\n/mnt/usbdisk/Private/\n          |-- Dir1\n             |-- ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWa.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA---\n             |-- ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWa.BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB---\n             |-- ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWa.CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC---\n             ...\n          |---Dir2\n             |-- ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED.FWa.DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD---\n             ...\n\nI've created 2 plain not-name-encrypted directories (Dir1 and Dir2) in the unmounted Private directory to better organize my files. They were supposed to also appear in clear whenever Private was mounted.\nHowever trying to mount directly /mnt/usbdisk/Private got me the same result as you (lots of ???????).\nI got my files back by mounting /mnt/usbdisk/Private/Dir1 and /mnt/usbdisk/Private/Dir2 as sources.\nI still don't have the answer and I hope you've got a solution since it's a very old post ;-)\nDid I made a change that I don't remember ? Maybe something to do with ecryptfs_passthrough option (although I've played with it and got no difference) ?

The method you choose depends on what you are trying to\nachieve.\nTo Page The image keeps the same position in relation to the page margins. It does not move as you add or delete text or other graphics.\nThis method is useful when the image does not need to be visually\nassociated with a particular piece of text. It is often used when\nproducing newsletters or other documents that are very layout\nintensive, or for placing logos in letterheads.\nTo Paragraph The image is associated with a paragraph and moves with the paragraph. It may be placed in the margin or another\nlocation. This method is useful as an alternative to a table for\nplacing icons beside paragraphs.\nTo Character The image is associated with a character but is not in the text sequence. It moves with the paragraph but may be placed in\nthe margin or another location. This method is similar to anchoring to\na paragraph but cannot be used with drawing objects.\nAs Character The image is placed in the document like any other character and, therefore, affects the height of the text line and the\nline break. The graphic moves with the paragraph as you add or delete\ntext before the paragraph. This method is useful for keeping images in\nsequence in a procedure (by anchoring them as a character in a blank\nparagraph) or for adding a small (inline) icon in sequence in a\nsentence.\nTo Frame If the image has been placed in a frame, you can anchor the graphic in a fixed position inside the frame. The frame can then\nbe anchored to the page, a paragraph, or a character, as required.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Blurry tty with nvidia drivers I recently upgraded my computer, and after installing the latest Ubuntu there, have found an issue.

You should install Windows first, then Ubuntu, choosing to install it alongside the existing installation of Windows.\nYou can find information about installing Ubuntu alongside Windows on the WindowsDualBoot help article from the Ubuntu website. You should install Ubuntu after Windows for the reasons mentioned in that article.

However, after poking around a bit with rfkill, I found the problem.\nThis machine is an HP Omen, and for some reason the OS incorrectly detected it as an Acer machine and loaded the acer-wmi module. This, in turn, thought that the wifi was always disabled, and listed an unremovable soft-block on an \"acer-wireless\" object. \nDoing \n# rmmod acer-wmi\n\nfixed the problem.\nNow the (Kubuntu with KDE4) installer is hanging, but I have to figure that out separately...\n", "Q: Partitions on Ubuntu 14.04 I have a problem need help. I have two partitions called Data and Sofware.\nDefault, when I run command : \nls /media/my_username/\n\nIt's show empty (dont have any result on terminal)\nbut when I click on disk icon on launcher and run this command again, it's show two result.\nPlease let me know why ?\n\nA: Why does this happen?\nNon-system partitions are not mounted on startup. Your system knows the partitions are present (the disk icon is shown) but they are not yet accessible through the filesystem.\nFilemanagers automatically mount partitions when you click on them. They get mounted to /media/username/... That's why you see them only after you clicked on them, because nautilus mounted them when you clicked on them.\nMore information on what mounting is\nWhat can I do to see them immediately?\nYou can easily set a partition to automount on system startup. One of the ways is using the disks utility.

But now I have rebooted this OS and now it boots into a UEFI Interactive Shell v2.0. How can I boot normally into Grub again?\n\nA: I encountered the same problem and found that if I issue following command in the interactive shell, the virtual machine would boot into Ubuntu:\nfs0:\\efi\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n(Use backslash, forward slash does not work. Commands in UEFI interactive shell are case insensitive.)\nMy VirtualBox version is 4.3.20 r96997, Ubuntu version is 14.10 AMD64. I do not know why this happens and how to solve it. Just found this not elegant and still a little bit troublesome workaround.\nUpdate 1:\nI read this, tracked down to a bug report and found a better workaround.\nUpdate 2:\nWorkaround in Update 1 failed. I turned off the virtual machine, launched it. And it booted into UEFI Interactive shell again. According to this, the problem was probably cause by a VirtualBox bug. I am still looking for further solution to this.\nUpdate 3:\nFinally found an solution. According to this, you need to create a startup.nsh script manually. Except for the method in mentioned post, you can also do this:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n$ cd /mnt\n$ sudo sh -c \"echo '\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi' > startup.nsh\"\n\n\nA: Copy grubx64.efi to /EFI/boot/bootx64.EFIVirtualBox use that bootx64.efi to boot.Ref.: Archlinux Virtualbox wiki\n\nA: I recently encountered this problem. Please check your virtual OS settings. Right click on virtual os-> system->Extended features-> Enable EFI(uncheck this). \n\nA: I had the same problem (with the EFI enabled because I couldn't get it to run otherwise). Strange; although installation of Ubuntu 14.04.2 got no error, installing Kubuntu 15.04 failed to finalize. It froze at the very end when asked to remove DVD. After reset, it booted fine but after power down it brought up shell.\nSo, to avoid shell type:\n\nfs0:\n  edit startup.nsh \n\nand on the opened window add these 2 lines:\n\nFS0:\n  \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\npress Ctrl + s and Enter to save and Ctrl + q to quit. Then restart VM.\nAlternatively, you can always use these 2 lines to exit shell and boot OS. But second time you restart you will be in a shell again and to avoid it edit startup.nsh.\n\nA: Another option is to un-check the Extended Features option called 'Enable EFI' under 'Motherboard' for your VM.\nHad this issue come up for Gnome Ubuntu 12.04.2 amd64bit installation. \nDiscovered this after having to change settings for hardware acceleration.\nI was left with having VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging enabled. My VM has 2 CPUs, 8GB RAM for reference.\nAfter un-checking the issue is completely by-passed Gnome Ubuntu boots up no issues. \nRunning Virtual Box 4.3.18 r96516 on Windows 7 64-bit Host.\n\nA: I could solve this issue by changing the cdrom device within virtualbox from IDE to SATA. I removed the standard mapping of the virtual cdrom drive within the device configuration.\nSimply add a cdrom device to the existing SATA Controller which is to be used for your installation media.\nEt voila, no further problems with EFI.\n\nA: for this you need to write it like the following:\nfs0:\ncd EFI\ncd ubuntu\ngrubx64\n\nthis is how i got it to work if you write it any other way it wont work.\n\nA: Another work around:\nIn the uefi shell, boot temporarily in to ubuntu using:\nfs0:\ncd EFI\ncd ubuntu\ngrubx64\n\nThen, inside ubuntu, edit startup.nsh file like below:\nOpen terminal Ctrl+Alt+T.\nType:\nsudo nano /boot/efi/startup.nsh\n\nEnter your password.\nNow delete all that is in there using del or backspace key.\nThen type this exactly: (FS0- that is the numeral 0, not the alphabet O)\nFS0:\n\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nNow press Ctrl+O (That is alphabet O).\nThen, Alt+D (To change text to msdos format).\nThen press Enter.\nThen Ctrl+X.\nNow reboot.\nsudo reboot\n\nEverything should be fine now.\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 16.04.4 with EFI enabled and while starting the virtual machine I found that it won't boot and just stay in the EFI interactive shell.\nThis is how I fixed the boot:\nFirst, I found that the grubx64.efi is located in BLK2,\nso for a one time boot I just typed the following in the interactive shell:\nBLK2:/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n\nAnd viola, Ubuntu is up and running.\nI order to permanently fix this issue, once the system was up I echoed the following line into /boot/efi/startup.nsh.\nsudo echo 'BLK2:/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi' > /boot/efi/startup.nsh\n\nThat's it, the system will boot correctly.\n\nA: After installing Kubuntu15.10 in VirtualBox5 with UEFI, the reboot of the VM fails.\nAdding the line FS0:\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi in the UEFI-Shell doesn't help.\n\nAnd the solution with creating a new startup.nsh file in Kubuntu15.10 in the chroot environment with sudo echo '\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi' > startup.nsh  gives also no improvement.\n\nI found the solution:\nThe problem was, that the directory  /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu with the file grubx64.efi doesn't exist.\nAfter booting a Live-CD and changing to the chroot environment, I installed the missing packets and create the needed NVRAM entry with:\nsudo apt-get install grub-efi-amd64-signed shim-signed\nsudo update-grub\n\nA: For defining or change of efi boot directory need to first run this command. This solved my problem.\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi/\n\nNOTE: /dev/sda is the system hard disk.\n\nA: On some linux guests , install process does not update the efi boot order. It  depends  on the distro version and  virtualbox/efi version. This issue had affected, for example, Debian in early 2020 . The solutions are:\n1.manualy run efibootmgr\nhttps://linux.die.net/man/8/efibootmgr\n\n\n*fix efi boot order. For that, type first \"exit\" in efi shell, after vm start\n\n\nA: For ArchLinux on Virtualbox, following did the trick for me.\nOn EFI Shell enter the following\nShell> bcfg boot add 0 FS0:\\EFI\\GRUB\\grubx64.efi \"GRUB\"\n\nHere we are setting the EFI boot order.\nI assume this works for any other Linux guests as well having EFI boot.\nNote: Your directory structure might differ. You can do ls on EFI prompt to check your directory structure to reach grubx64.efi after entering FS0: and hit enter.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Enviromnent variable for subprocess I am trying to access an environment variable from a python process. I exported it like export var=value. This works fine for the command pyton program.py but not for sudo python program.py. How can I make sure the process can access the environment variable if it is started with sudo?\n\nA: The default security policy for sudo normally prevents it from inheriting environment variables. However unless the particular variable is explicitly denied in your sudoers file, you should be able to allow it by specifying the -E option to sudo, e.g.\n$ VAR=\"value\" python -c 'import os; print os.environ.get(\"VAR\")'\nvalue\n$ \n$ VAR=\"value\" sudo python -c 'import os; print os.environ.get(\"VAR\")'\nNone\n$ \n$ VAR=\"value\" sudo -E python -c 'import os; print os.environ.get(\"VAR\")'\nvalue\n$ \n\nSee man sudo\n   -E          The -E (preserve environment) option indicates to the\n               security policy that the user wishes to preserve their\n               existing environment variables.  The security policy may\n               return an error if the -E option is specified and the user\n               does not have permission to preserve the environment.\n\n", "Q: Emulation in Ubuntu I am wondering if I can emulate Ubuntu on Windows through VirtualBox, then emulate Windows on Ubuntu through VirtualBox. \nMy system specifications:\nProcessor: AMD Turion x2 2.3 Ghz\nMemory: 2 Gb RAM\nVideo: ATI Radeon HD 3200 256 MB\n\n\nA: As you can emulate both Ubuntu on a Windows host, and Windows on an Ubunut host with Virtual Box there is at present no support for nested virtual machines (i.e. emulating Windows in an emulated Ubuntu on a Windows host). \nApart from a lack of support it would also mean a considerable drop in performance making it rater useless.\n", "Q: Change auto-renaming in guake Is there any way to remove path from tab name in guake?\nUsually I open several hosts in different tabs and I rename them all according to the host name. It is annoying to make the same action on every new tab.\nDefault behavior (vte.get_window_title()) is not convenient because tab name has path in it. I don't need any path in tab, and also usually names with path are very long.\n\nA: I feel like I've already answered this question somewhere but I couldn't find it, so this answer (and this question) are possible duplicates.\nAnyway, the command you're looking for is probably\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/guake/general/use_vte_titles --type boolean false\n\nThis always does it for me.\n", "Q: How to install python as a user I need to install python so I can install pip/fab which do not need root access to run and install things. I'm setting up a vagrant VM environment which needs to run fab as non root to function and I really don't want to sudo everything or start changing permissions.\nI know with OSX I can install python with brew which will install python to /usr/local/bin or something and then I can just edit my bash_profile path to look in that directoy first.\n\nA: Use virtual environments. This allows you to make unlimited amounts of virtual python environments, so you can easily use different sets of packages for different projects. Install the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n\nThen:\nsudo pip install virtualenvwrapper\n\nThen, append the following to your bashrc file:\nexport WORKON_HOME=~/Envs\nmkdir -p ~/Envs\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\nThen, suppose we want to make a virtual environment called \"test-env\" we can execute:\nmkvirtualenv test-env \n\nTo use it:\nworkon test-env\n\nFrom within this environment you can then pip install anything (without sudo!). \nTo exit your virtual environment: \ndeactivate \n\n\nA: Yes you can do that. You can install python into your home directory. So you don't need to have root permissions but little bit ground work needed to do so. Follow the answer.\nOpen your terminal , assume you are installing python to your home directory.\nmkdir python\ncd python\nwget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/Python-2.7.6.tgz\ntar -xvf Python-2.7.6.tgz\ncd Python-2.7.6\n\nThen now, while doing configure, you must mention that where you are trying to install it.\nso like \n./configure --prefix=$HOME/python\nmake\nmake install\n\nSo right now your python has installed in your home at python named directory. so your system must now that the python which it has to access is over there. So little but bashrc need to be done. \nIn terminal type:\n    nano ~/.bashrc\nThen add as\nexport PATH=$HOME/python/Python-2.7.6/:$PATH\n\nand save -exit with CTRL+X+Y\nthen do \nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nRecommended : restart your PC to update the new environment setting we've made.\nThat's it.

I know this does not run by default, but can it be set up?\n\nA: Running Minecraft on directly on top of the kernel frame buffer is not possible to my knowledge, nor would it be in the developers interest since they would have to implement a lot of stuff themselves that is being done for them in X11 (like input management, display device management, ...). I don't think they are interested in that...\nAs you have indicated in the comments your actual goal is to make Minecraft run faster by removing layers. While the idea of getting rid of the X11 server might sound good it would hardly improve your framerate compared to using non-composited X11! If your window manager doesn't use compositing X11 will basically just redirect all OpenGL calls (what Minecraft uses for rendering) directly to the graphics card.\nHow to disable compositing\nSome things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compositing itself isn't necessarily bad for performance, just the way X11 does it sucks!\n\n*Disabling it will cause transparent surfaces to be filled with black instead of whatever is behind them.\n\n*Most desktops nowadays use compositing. In some of them (such as Ubuntu's default desktop Unity and GNOME Shell) you cannot disable compositing at all.\n\n\nIn Xubuntu/XFCE4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Window manager tweaks\"\n\n*Select the tab \"Compositor\"\n\n*Uncheck \"Enable display compositing\"\n\n\nIn Kubuntu/KDE4:\nYou can disable compositing at any time by pressing Alt+Shift+F12. In the window management settings there are also some options to disable compositing when a matching application is running. Note however that compositing is automatically disabled when a single application runs in fullscreen mode on one screen.

In application Additional Drivers there was nothing under the tab \"Additional drivers\".\nSo I wondered - should I download GPU drivers from the official nvidia site or maybe by sudo apt-get install nvidia-current because the seemed pretty different. Or maybe somehow else?\n\nA: You could download the NVIDIA Driver x64 version from here. http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/77525/en-us. You will actually be downloading .run file. After downloading the file, you will have to open terminal and follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the .run file executable by typing sudo chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.32.run\n\n*Then, type after the above executed, sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.32.run\nNow, you could proceed with the installation.\n\nA: The lack of Additional Drivers is a known bug in Ubuntu 14.04 (I'm guessing you're running that). I ran into this issue myself with my GTX 750 Ti.\nUnless you need the performance boost for gaming, the default Nouveau drivers are just fine. However, if you do want the performance there are multiple methods to resolving this.\nDownload & install via the .run file from NVIDIA.\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to download the newest NVIDIA stable driver from here and save it somewhere you'll remember - your home directory is a good choice.\nNote, make sure you've saved and closed all your applications before continuing any further, because you're going to kill the display manager/X server and thus any applications running.\n\n\n*Once the driver has downloaded, you'll need to go into a TTY. You can do this via Ctrl+Alt+F1. Once you've got a text console, you need to log in with your username and password.\n\n\n*Once you've logged in on the TTY you need to get the same directory as the downloaded .run file. It'll be in your downloads folder most likely. Run cd ~/Downloads.\n\n\n*Next, you'll need to kill the display manager/X server. You can accomplish this via running sudo killall lightdm.\n\n\n*Finally, run sudo chmod +x ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.32.run && sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.32.run.\nYou'll have to accept a few things here and there. If you get an error saying that the pre-installation script failed, go ahead and ignore that. I got the exact same error and there's no actual problem.\n\n\n*Once the script completes, you'll need to run sudo reboot and you should boot into an NVIDIA-drivers-driven system!\nUse the Xorg-Edgers PPA Drivers:\nThis seems to be the most common answer, but it's probably not the best choice, because the drivers from this PPA are known to cause various graphical issues like black screens and whatnot.\nIf the first method doesn't work, go ahead and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nsudo reboot\n\nThis will add the Xorg-Edgers PPA and install the latest NVIDIA 340 drivers. Once you reboot you can remove, or keep the PPA - that's up to you.\n", "Q: Computer won't boot after installing Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS to replace Windows 8.1 My problem is extremely similar to the one found here: Just installed ubuntu 14.04 but after restart it wont boot.  However, the solution there did not work for me.\nI am using a Toshiba satellite laptop that came preinstalled with Windows 8.1.  When I tried to install Ubuntu on it, it didn't detect my Windows 8.1 partition.  That's fine with me - I wanted to replace it anyway - but after the installation was complete (I checked for defects in the DVD and found none) my computer won't boot.  It just says\n\nReboot and select a proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press any key.\n\nI found that question here (Just installed ubuntu 14.04 but after restart it wont boot), so I tried what it said.  Unlike the user in that problem I am using a DVD to install Ubuntu.  So I started a live session, opened gparted, and found a few drives.  To my memory, they were:\n\nsda1: about 1GB of space, ~500MB used and ~500 MB unused.  This had a \"boot\" flag.  I figured it was the live CD I was using.\nsda2: about ~450GB of space, most unused.  I figured this was my hard drive.  It did not have a boot flag.\nsda3: some puny drive I didn't pay attention to.  It said \"Linux-swap\".\nUnallocated space.\n\nI added a boot flag to sda2, as the user question I referred to instructed me to, exited the live session and tried to boot, but that did not work.  I restarted a live session and ran a boot repair.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9632311/\nThen I figured I'd ask here, since what worked for him didn't work for me.

As I want my Windows7 to stay light, safe and stable (if possible), I'd love to keep it away from the internet and get rid of every heavy softwares on it (in an ideal way, id love to run a \"minimal\" W7 with only the adobe suite and C4D on it).  \nThe problem is that, obviously, many times, I need to access the internet while working on W7, but of course, rebooting and switching between the 2 OSs is not a good solution.\nSo I thought about a virtual machine and asked myself :\nis it possible to run a \"minimal\" W7 installation with no connection to the internet, and to run Xubuntu in a virtual machine, connected to the internet, with all the softwares I need, and of course with the ability to securely share files betweens the 2 OSs ?  \nAccording to Elder Geek's answer, I have considered the option of having Ubuntu as a host but i'm afraid it will slow down w7 too much. I especially need all the graphic card capabilities. So I wonder :can I set a firewall in w7 that blocks everything except the VM ? Will it works then ?   \nIf not, according to you, what would be my ideal workflow ?\nThanks a lot guys, for taking time to read ! Hope my question makes sense.\nEmmanuel.\n\nA: The answer is yes you can run a minimal Win 7 installation with Ubuntu as the host. (the host machine needs to be connected to the internet for the virtual machine to have access. )\nWhat I would recommend is to run a Win 7 minimal install as a virtual machine with Ubuntu as host and prevent the VM from using the network that you have open for use on the Ubuntu host. Workflow is a matter of opinion so I'll leave that alone. I've effectively used this approach hosting windows 7 and also windows xp under virtual box to run those applications that only run under windows that I can't do without.\nAs you can adjust the number of cores and the Graphics memory from the VM settings I think you can get reasonable performance from this approach although some tweaking may be necessary for optimum performance.\nYou can disable the VM connectivity to the network from the VM settings as shown below,\n\n as well as share storage as necessary between the host and the VM.\nSource: Experience..\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.10 not accepting my password I've tried changing it from grub recovery mode and using root@username mount -rw -o mount / and typing passwd username and entering my new password but when I try to login with the new password the screen just flickers and returns to the logon screen.

For bash, see the set of startup files.\n\n*Not in some sense (updating login records, for example).\n\n*If you have a folder called bin in $HOME, the default .profile for Ubuntu does add it to your PATH. Since .profile is sourced at login (even with a GUI login), it should be part of your PATH for non-login shells started after a re-login. It isn't wrong if a directory appears twice in PATH, see this U&L question for details.\n\n\nA: I found I had to edit the Default profile.

You can use parted or any other tool really.\n\n*If you need to set encryption or complex LVM you can do it at this stage\n\n*Start the installer (there's an icon on the desktop)\n\n*Choose the \"Something else\" option on the partitioning menu\n\n*You should see the partitions you've set up. For each partition, click it and then click change - then select the file system and/or mount point for that partition. Also, select whether to format the partition\n\n*Continue with the installation as usual\n\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Home directory permissions preventing ssh key authentication on Ubuntu Server 14.10 I have ubuntu server 14.10 with an SSH server on it, and have password authentication working fine from my System76 darter laptop running Debian Sid.

Is there any way to get that same functionality now or am I stuck using an ethernet cable?\n\nA: Ok. I assume you mean you are connecting into Ubuntu via a network cable and then want to use your wireless card to serve internet to other devices, sounds like you dont have a wireless router. This can actually be done pretty easily, not sure about other versions, but definitely in 14.04 and 14.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable WIFI and plug in an internet cable to your laptop so that your Ubuntu is connect to a wired internet and wireless is disabled.\n\n*Go to Network Icon on top panel -> Edit Connections …, then click the Add button in the pop-up window.\n\n*Choose Wi-Fi from the drop-down menu when you’re asked to choose a connection type\n\n*In next window, do \nType in a connection name. The name will be used later.\nType in a SSID \nSelect mode: Infrastructure \nDevice MAC address: select your wireless card from drop-down menu.\n\n*Go to Wi-Fi Security tab, select security type WPA & WPA2 Personal and set a password.\n\n*Go to IPv4 Settings tab, from Method drop-down box select Shared to other computers.\n\nWhen done, click the save button.\nAfter above steps, a configuration file was created under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections directory. File name is same to the connection name you typed in step 4.\nNow press Ctrl+Alt+T on keyboard to open terminal. When it opens, paste the commands below and hit enter to edit the configuration file:\n gksu gedit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/wifi-hotspot\n\nReplace wifi-hotspt with the connection name you typed in step 4.\nWhen the file opens, find out the line mode=infrastructure and change it to mode=ap. Finally save the file.\nWhen everything’s done, enable WIFI from Network Manager icon on the panel. It should automatically connect to the hotspot you created. If not, select “Connect to Hidden Wi-Fi Network …” and select it from the drop-down box.\nYou can now connect any other device via wireless, but the Ubuntu machine will need to keep it's wired connection.\nedit: Now that I think of it, you may also be able to follow a simular process using WIFI and ditch the cable. I tried a few times quickly and couldn't get it to work. But it will work with wired connection to Ubuntu, and then access wireless via other devices.\n", "Q: Am I better off with xbuntu or lubuntu? I have an old computer and I have installed the latest Ubuntu 14.0 LTS 32-bit. However, the computer is fairly slow. Applications take long to open.
