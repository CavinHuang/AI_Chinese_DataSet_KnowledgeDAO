I have tried installing both 361.42 and 340.96 and both times, I get a blank screen after restarting.\n\n\nORIGINAL QUESTION:\nWhen I install the nvidia driver for ubuntu and then restart, I get a blank screen. I have no tried 2 of the nvidia drivers and both times I get a blank screen.\nHow do I install the nvidia drivers and not get a blank screen?\nDid a google search and it seems I'm the first to encounter this issue since 16.04 has been released: \nhttps://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=6tUZV-rEEuTR8geL_5PABA&gws_rd=ssl#q=ubuntu+16.04+nvidia+blank&tbs=qdr:d\n\nA: My graphics card is the NVidia GeForce GTX 950.\nThe first thing I did was download the latest stable NVidia driver from nvidia.com (for me, it was 361.42).  I was sure to select the latest stable and certified driver. It's a \".run\" file, by the way.  Search on how to install .run files if you're not familiar with this.\nI then blacklisted the Nouveau drivers according to this post (my steps are below and are slightly different from this post): Install Nvidia driver instead of nouveau\nI did all of my work through the virtual terminal accessed by Ctrl+Alt+F1 from the log in screen:\n\n*\n\n*Blacklist the modules. Open the blacklist.conf file.\n sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nadd the following modules to the end of the file:\n blacklist vga16fb\n blacklist nouveau\n blacklist rivafb\n blacklist nvidiafb\n blacklist rivatv\n\nSave the file and exit.\n\n\n*Remove all the nvidia* packages (note this didn't do anything for me, but it's recommended.  No harm done in running it)\n sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\n\n\n*Update the initramfs disk. Mine was configured to load the nouveau drivers. It takes several seconds.  Don't reboot or poweroff!\n sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n*Stop the display manager and then install.\nAt the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 again to get into the virtual terminal. Once you are in the text mode, stop the display manager:\n sudo service lightdm stop\n\n\n\n*Then, run the installation file (the .run file you downloaded).  The installation is well documented and contains lots of useful messages along the way (imagine that!).  I did get the error about the pre-install script failing.  I continued anyway.  I got asked \"Would you like to run the nvidia-xconfig utility to automatically update your X configuration file so that the NVIDIA X driver will be used when you restart X? Any pre-existing X configuration file will be backed up\"  I answered \"Yes\" and continued.  I have a 64-bit system and got 32-bit errors.  I didn't worry about it and continued.  The 64-bit ones installed fine.  I got to the end of the installation!\n\n\n*Cross your fingers, reboot, and log in.  My system FINALLY came up.  I hope yours does too!\n\nA: Where/When do you get the blank screen? Is it when the grub menu should appear upon boot, or when the Ubuntu Unity login screen should appear? If it's the latter, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add nomodeset on your Ubuntu grub entry. Highlight the entry you use to boot, press e, then add replace\n...ro    quiet splash ...\nwith\n...ro    nomodeset quiet splash ...\nIf that boots to the login screen correctly, press Ctrl + Alt + F2, login, then run sudo prime-select intel. Then reboot and see if that fixes it.\nAlso, how are you installing NVidia drivers? DOuble-check at nvidia.com if you're using the correct ones.\n\nA: Try to add nvidia ppa ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa and install the lastest 364.15.\nThat works for me with optimus 860m.\nThis works only if you have Secure Boot disabled.\n\nA: Maybe you have to blacklist the nvidia drivers at startup. That is sometimes needed by hybrid graphic cards.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the file: /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf and add: \nblacklist nvidia-XXX\nblacklist nvidia-XXX-updates\nblacklist nvidia-experimental-XXX\n\nreplace the XXX by the version of the graphic driver. For example 346\n\n*reboot your computer.\n\nA: I solved this issue a different way.  I installed 16.04 on a very old computer.  I installed the Nvidia legacy driver, and got the blank screen.\nI installed Lubuntu to use the LXDE desktop.  That is working very well for me.\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: Make sure you have secureboot disabled, I happened to have mine enabled and ignored the warning when I upgraded to 16.04. If you have secureboot on, it will get stuck on gdm or in a black screen.\n\nA: Try adding the following options to your grub /etc/default/grub config file.

In MS-DOS or Windows' Command Prompt, one can simply press Esc.\nIs there a reason why the Esc key isn't set by default in Ubuntu Terminals to perform the same action as Ctrl+U?  Is there a way to enable such functionality? I really want to not have to remember a different shortcut key just because I am typing in a different OS.\n(I believe my question is not a duplicate of the one whose answer I linked to, because that one is asking for the equivalent shortcut key in Ubuntu, and I am asking for a way to use Esc or for a reason why it would be a bad idea to set it up this way.)\n\nA: You can bind ESC to the Readline function unix-line-discard:\nbind '\"\\e\": unix-line-discard'\n\nTo make the change permanent, add the command to ~/.xinputrc:\nprintf \"bind '\\\"\\\\\\e\\\": unix-line-discard'\\n\" >>~/.xinputrc\n\nAnd source ~/.xinputrc in ~/.bashrc:\nprintf 'source ~/.xinputrc\\n' >>~/.bashrc\n\nTo load the change also in the current shell, source ~/.xinputrc:\nsource ~/.xinputrc\n\nThis is a Bash feature, so it will work across any terminal, unless the terminal is hijacking the ESC key itself, for example if ESC is part of a terminal-specific keystroke, in which case you'll have to disable the offending keystroke in the terminal.\nSee also help bind and bind -P for a list of the available Readline functions and the keys / keystrokes they're currently bound to.\n\nA: The only way i know is to show if there is a way to change the link of the keys. \nMaybe there is a setting of that in the terminal program you use.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 final not booting from stick: gfxboot.c32: not a COM32R image The brand new 16.04 final does not boot from USB stick:\nMissing parameter in configuration file.

I have a limited amount of free disk space left on my machine, (around 9 - 10 GB), and I would like to try out the latest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on my computer, so my question is that, Is it possible to install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with less than 25 GB of disk space (which is stated on the official documentation, as the recommended disk space for installation)?\n\nA: 25GB is the recommended available space, however the minimums are stated in section 3.4 of the installation guides. Visit https://help.ubuntu.com/16.04/installation-guide/ and select your machine architecture first. AMD64 with the desktop has a min of 10GB HDD.\n\nA: The recommended minimum hard drive space is 2 GB for server and 10 GB for destop installation. However, the installation guide states:\n\nA minimal server installation of xenial requires 400MB of disk space. The standard Ubuntu desktop installation requires 2GB.\n\nSo, technically, you should be able to install it on a far smaller drive (unless the installer refuses to do so, I didn’t try it), but of course you may easily run into out of disk space problems which easily play havoc on linuxes. So keep an eye on that!\n\nA: You state in your question that you have about 9-10GB of disk space.\nIf you plan on running the Ubuntu Desktop, you must have at least 10GB of disk space.  25GB is recommended, but 10GB is the minimum.\nUnless you can meet that 10GB minimum (and no, 9GB is not 10GB), you should not be using Ubuntu on that small a space, and should probably be cleaning off other stuff from your computer to make more space for your system.  (Very few systems can operate with just 9GB or 10GB free, if the disk is large - the rule of thumb is once the drive dips under 10% of available free space, it's going to slow down considerably).\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/16.04/installation-guide/, and knowledge gathered through trainings and experience\n\nA: The minimum requirement is 5GB, not 25.

You would need to enable r/w access to your system partition for apt-get to work at all, but that seems to be strongly discouraged.\nThere is currently no supported way to install legacy X11 software, but it should all be ok in a few weeks when OTA11 comes out and we get the Libertine GUI app and other tools to make it work.\n\nA: I managed to get netbeans working in the container, it was ok, but Ive been exploring and using apt-get and now I realized I shouldn’t have done that. So I am erasing doing a hard reset here, and will wait for the OTA11\n\nA: https://drive.google.com/?usp=docs_web gives an example of how to install Inkscape in a libertine/puritine container. It worked fine for me and I installed a couple of other X11 packages (PSPP and wavesurfer) the same way. So with a bit of trial and error, it's possible.

You will end up with a package that is not completely installed nor completely uninstalled.\nThe solution, in this case, is to sudo apt-get install the package. If necessary, do sudo apt-get install --reinstall [package]. Missing files will be added to the system, and any missing dependencies installed on the fly. Then the package can be uninstalled completely in the usual way: sudo apt-get remove [package].\nIf apt-get refuses to re-install the package because of other (dependency) issues, you can only use apt-get to download the package and use dpkg directly to install it:\napt-get download mysql-common\nsudo dpkg -i mysql-common_*.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nSometimes you can skip the download because Apt tends to keep an archive of previously downloaded and installed packages in /var/cache/apt/archives/ so you can start directly from the 2nd step:\nsudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/mysql-common_*.deb\n\n", "Q: Black screen (without cursor) displays after login to Unity 8 on Ubuntu 16.04 When log to Unity 8 mir on Ubuntu 16.04, A black screen displays on the screen without the cursor.

I need to kill a process that contains myName in its description. Currently I'm doing:\nps -ax |grep myName\nI see PID\nkill -9 PID\n\nHow can I do the same with one command without entering the PID?\n\nA: If myName is the name of the process/executable which you want to kill, you can use:\npkill myName\n\npkill by default sends the SIGTERM signal (signal 15). If you want the SIGKILL or signal 9, use:\npkill -9 myName\n\nIf myName is not the process name, or for example, is an argument to another (long) command, pkill (or pgrep) may not work as expected. So you need to use the -f option.\nFrom man kill:\n-f, --full\n              The pattern is normally only matched against the  process  name.\n              When -f is set, the full command line is used.\nNOTES\nThe process name used for matching is limited to the 15 characters present\n   in the output of /proc/pid/stat.  Use the -f option to match  against  the\n   complete command line, /proc/pid/cmdline.\n\nSo:\npkill -f myName\n\nor\nkill -9 $(pgrep -f myName)\n\n\nA: There are two very neat commands pgrep and pkill that allow entering search term or part of the command name , and it will either provide the PID(s) of the process or (in case of pkill) kill that process.\n$ pgrep -f firefox                                                             \n23699\n\nRunning the same command with pkill and -f flag will close all  the firefox windows.\nThe -f flag is needed specifically to search through the full command-line of a process.\n\nA: With pkill and sending signal 9, you can kill process by name:\nsudo pkill -9 myName\n\n\nA: With a command's name use:\npkill -9 myscript\n\nIf you are looking for a string in the command line:\nkill -9 $(ps ax | grep myName | fgrep -v grep | awk '{ print $1 }')\n\nI have to warn you: the above command can send a SIGKILL signal to more than one process.\n\nA: You could do a simple for loop over all the PID's associated with the specific process name, like this:\n$ for i in $( ps ax | awk '/[m]yName/ {print $1}' ); do kill ${i}; done\n\nThis will kill all processes that contain the word: myName.\n", "Q: Wi-fi disappearing 16.04 randomly Wi-fi connectivity randomly disappears on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and restores after restart.\nWhen it's gone, Wireless is enabled, but offers no networks, and the hidden wi-fi finds my connection, but won't connect to it.\nEnable/disable doesn't do the trick.\nEDIT: Actually, the re-enabling works, but the icon doesn't change and the window is actually as if it was disabled.

Use it at your own risk.\nBackground: when Parallels Tools is installed it copies under /usr/lib/compiz/ a bunch of files with this pattern libprlcompiz_*_*_*_*.so (with digits instead of *). Those are unity plugins and, as it seems, when unity gets loaded the latest version of this plugin is loaded as well.\nNow, in my case it happens that unity tries to load libprlcompiz_0_9_12_2.so, which causes the error: Segmentation fault (core dumped).\nSo my catch was to rename this file and hope that the previous plugin version has no bugs (namely libprlcompiz_0_9_12_1.so). Open a terminal and:\nsudo mv /usr/lib/compiz/libprlcompiz_0_9_12_2.so /usr/lib/compiz/libprlcompiz_0_9_12_2.so.backup\nreboot\n\nNow everything should work fine after login.\nI still have three parallels related processes appearing in unity side bar after login (with a question mark as icon), which disappear after a while.\nLet me know if this works for you.\n\nA: Just installed an update of Parallels Version 11.2.0 (32581) and I seems to have a new package of Parallels Tools.

They have jumped from over 40 (prior to the release) to 100 now (according to http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop). \nThe completion status given by launchpad (https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+translations) however, doesn't have a single language at 100%. What is the criteria a language needs to meet to be 'fully translated'? And can anyone give an account of the sudden jump from over 40 to 100? \nAny information on this would be greatly appreciated! \nThanks. \n\nA: I can only answer authoritatively with respect to the Ubuntu Official documentation on help.ubuntu.com, however for Ubuntu desktop, the same stuff is also in the yelp based help package.\nThe Ubuntu Serverguide is published in about 64 languages, however only French Italian and Russian seem to somewhat keep up. It is published in all languages regardless of the percentage complete on the translations status, meaning some languages are basically just U.S. English. There were very late changes to the serverguide this cycle, and so translations are behind. We published what we had yesterday anyhow. We are still struggling to get subject matter expert input for several chapters which are obsolete, Samba for example. There will need to be point releases. The PDF version of the serverguide is only published in US English.\nSince the serverguide is NOT a released package we not bound by any SRU (Stable release Update) rules. Also, it has been our observation, over a number of years now, at least with respect to the serverguide, that translators work on it when they feel so inclined and not to any deadline. Therefore I always offer to just to an update publish whenever asked to, rather on some fixed timeline. We have never been asked.\nThe desktop help documents are also published as a package and as part of the language pack, and therefore must adhere to the release schedule and SRU rules. It is published in about 66 languages, regardless of the translations percent complete. Basically, a snapshot of translations is taken at the release schedule deadline, but work can continue thereafter towards a point release. Late changes to the naming of \"Ubuntu Software\" from \"Software\" which had just changed from \"Ubuntu Software Center\" missed all deadlines and will have to be an SRU update, probably about the 16.04.1 date.\nBy the way, that link you gave for the translations status, does not include the serverguide, something that has annoyed me for years now.\n\nA: I'm afraid I can't explain the number; IMO it's not correct, so I just filed a bug report.\nPersonally I would define \"fully translated\" for the desktop as a translation coverage which gives a user experience essentially in the native language for 'normal' desktop use. The translation status page includes a lot of irrelevant packages/strings for such desktop use, e.g. specific to the server, Ubuntu flavors, or error messages for various 'expert' command line tools.\n", "Q: how to stop transmission in the midst of \"verify local data\"? I cannot seem to stop \"verify local data\":\nthufir@tleilax:~$ \nthufir@tleilax:~$ transmission-remote -t all --stop\n[2016-04-22 04:26:22.956 PDT] transmission-remote:  (http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc/) Couldn't connect to server\nthufir@tleilax:~$ \n\nbecause I'm using the transmission GUI?\nFrom the GUI, how do I stop a verification without purging data?\n\nA: transmission-remote interacts with transmission-daemon, which isn't started along with transmission-gtk, hence the error.\nIn any case, there's no direct way to stop a torrent from being verified (neither via the command line nor via the GUI).\nHowever you can simply close Transmission via the GUI, and the torrent will be paused immediately skipping the verification. There's no risk of purging the data (if you change your mind you'll have to verify the torrent from the start again though).\nAlternatively, from the command line, you could send a SIGTERM signal to to the process, which will be handled and intepreted in the same way of a closure from the GUI:\npkill -x transmission-gt\n\n", "Q: GLib-GObject-WARNING when closing gvim I set my computer up new with Ubuntu 16.04 today.

In my case it was also an NVidia driver issue. I have 8 monitors and I like how the NVidia diver performs with them. So to get it working, I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressed CTRL + ALT + F1 at the login prompt and logged into through terminal.\n\n*Backed up may old /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, as it was a pain to configure 8 monitors.\n\n*Downloaded the driver file from NVidia: NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.44.run\n\n*Ran the following command: sudo service lightdm stop (driver install will fail if this step is skipped).\n\n*Reinstalled the driver: sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-367.44.run I was notified that the auto generated script did not complete and given the choice to continue the install which I accepted. I also chose to have the driver installed as a kernel module and have the program generate a new xorg.conf file (backed mine up before). At the end of the process it complained about a missing link to a lib, but gave instructions on linking to it. I put off dealing with that for later.\n\n*Rebooted and was able to login through the GUI.\n\nA: The problem is that, when you update Ubuntu (and even when you install certain programs that call /sbin/ldconfig), there are changes made to /etc/ls.so.cache. \nTry it and you'll see that the ld.so.cache file after such an installation/update will have a different size than before the operation. \nThis, in Ubuntu 16.04, results in a login loop when logging in from lightDM. Therefore, you should keep a copy of the original ld.so.cache since, with the new version generated after the installation/update, lightDM will no longer authenticate.\nI have had this issue many times and have had to be very careful with this. I always keep a copy of the original file (/etc/ld.so.cache.orig) that lets me log in without the login loop and use that to log in. Then, once I have logged in successfully, I copy the new one (/etc/ld.so.cache.new) over. To do so, I have modified my ~/.bash_profile file and have added this line:\nsudo /bin/cp /etc/ld.so.cache.new /etc/ld.so.cache\n\nThen, in order to copy the original file back when exiting the session so that I'll be ab;e to log ina gain next time, I have added this line to /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default:\n/bin/cp /etc/ld.so.cache.orig /etc/ld.so.cache\n\nFor that to work, I have modified /etc/sudoers (by running sudo vosudo) to allow non privileged users to run the copy command:\nALL     ALL= NOPASSWD: /bin/cp /etc/ld.so.cache.new /etc/ld.so.cache\n\nThis might look like an ugly hack, but it gets around this login-loop issue and, also, to keep the new /etc/ld.so.cache file. \n\nA: In my case original nvidia drivers was the cause and switching back to open source nouveau helped. First, I removed all stuff from nvidia:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge 'nvidia-*'\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\necho 'nouveau' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\n(source: How can I uninstall a nvidia driver completely ?)\nAfter that I could login, but unity didn't load, there was no launcher etc. It turn out I had to re-enable Unity plugin:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nDISPLAY=:0 ccsm\nFind the Unity plugin and enable it.\n\n(source: Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears)\n\nA: I was using xfce and I manually checked each folder and file by renaming them. Deleting ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml worked for me. \nI had nvidia drivers as well, but they were working fine when I logged in as root and a backup user.\n\nA: In my case this issue was caused by accidentially enabling Secure Boot in UEFI, which effects in third party drivers unusable (e.g. Nvidia). That caused X session error. After disabling Secure Boot, everything went back to normal.\n", "Q: 'dpkg-source' unpack error on Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 After installing Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 with GNOME 3.20 in a VM I have found that if I run an apt-get source command such as:\napt-get source apt\n\nI get the following errors after it has downloaded the files:\nsh: 1: dpkg-source: not found\nUnpack command 'dpkg-source -x apt_1.2.10ubuntu1.dsc' failed.\nCheck if the 'dpkg-dev' package is installed.\nE: Sub-process dpjg-source returned an error code (1)\n\nI did not get this error on previous versions of Ubuntu GNOME nor do I get this error on Ubuntu (Unity) 16.04 so what is the problem?

I use the following command to transfer files across my home network (when I have to transfer a lot of files, I usually archive them with the tar utility):\nscp -c blowfish [FILE] [USER]@[ADDRESS]:[PATH]\n\nIt takes about 25 minutes to send 500 Mb of data to another computer. The average speed is at about 600 KB/s. I think there absolutely must be a way to make the process go faster because I don't believe that I'm able to pull a 1 Gb file comfortably off the Web in less than 10 minutes, but I can't get a 500 Mb file sent across the network in less that time.\n\nA: Two ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Experiment with a different cipher\n\n*Use 'on the fly' compression\n\n\n1. Experiment with a different cipher:\nOne idea is to test the various ciphers which are available through scp and try to determine which is the fastest for you. (The idea behind this is that it is the encryption of your data that is taking up the time.) Find the available ciphers by running the following:\nandrew@athens:~$ ssh -Q cipher\n3des-cbc\nblowfish-cbc\ncast128-cbc\narcfour\narcfour128\narcfour256\naes128-cbc\naes192-cbc\naes256-cbc\nrijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se\naes128-ctr\naes192-ctr\naes256-ctr\naes128-gcm@openssh.com\naes256-gcm@openssh.com\nchacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\nandrew@athens:~$ \n\nThis shows available ciphers on a default Xenial Xerus installation and can be added in using the syntax you have already suggested:\nscp -c <cipher> [FILE] [USER]@[ADDRESS]:[PATH]\n\nThis option is passed directly to ssh hence testing ssh itself for the available ciphers. Hopefully you can find a cipher that will allow an increase in your transfer speed, when you have found this cipher you can place it in ~/.ssh/config rather than typing it in each time...\n2. Use 'on the fly' compression:\nscp is able to compress your transfers 'on the fly' meaning that the compressions is only used during transfer and will not be seen at either the host or remote ends. Add this in using the -C option:\nscp -c <cipher> -C [FILE] [USER]@[ADDRESS]:[PATH]\n\nHere is an example on my own system:\ndebug1: compress outgoing: raw data 365865, compressed 150118, factor 0.41\ndebug1: compress incoming: raw data 150118, compressed 365865, factor 2.44\n\nThe compression level is the same as the one used for gzip and if you really wish to experiment you can use the 'CompressionLevel' option which varies from 1-9, 1 being the fastest compression, 9 being the slowest with best compression and 6 being the default. This can be set in ~/.ssh/configas follows:\nHost *\nCompression yes\nCompressionLevel 9\n\nBear in mind that this sets high compression for all scp / ssh transfers, it can be set for individual hosts if you wish...\nUse the -v option to investigate the effects of any changes you make. You will note with experimentation that different data will have different compression ratios.\n", "Q: How can I use a script to get the IP address from ifconfig if the size of the IP changes in size with each connection? I'm currently working with this\n\n     IFTUN=\"$(ifconfig tun)\"\n     IPADD=${IFTUN:106:13}\n     echo $IPADD\n\n\nBut if the size of the IP address changes this isn't going to work anymore.\n\n     inet addr:1.2.3.4  P-t-P:1.2.3.4  Mask:255.255.254.0\n     UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n     RX packets:1151 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n\n\nSo what I'm after is a way to get the IP from ifconfig no matter what the number of chars is \"1.2.3.4\" or say \"111.22.3.44\" or even \"111.222.333.444\"\n\nA: In order to get your IP Adress from Ifconfig you can use this:\necho `ifconfig tun0 2>/dev/null|awk '/inet addr:/ {print $2}'|sed 's/addr://'`\n\nThis command will get the IP address of tun0.\n\nA: Use the ip command insted of ifconfig, which is deprecated. \nipAddr=$( ip a s eth0 | awk '/inet.*brd/ {print $2}' )\n\nSample output: 172.16.2.136/16 \nIf you don't want to include the CIDR, use this:\nipAddr=$( ip a s eth0 | awk '/inet.*brd/ {print $2}' | awk -F'/' '{print $1}' )\n\nSample output: 172.16.2.136\n\nA: I would not use ifconfig because at least on some distro's it's being replaced by ip. \nIf you know your interface you can do this: \nip addr |grep eth0 |grep inet |awk '{print $2}'\nIt will give you the mask also which you can cut off like this \nip addr |grep eth0 |grep inet |awk '{print $2}' |cut -d \"/\" -f 1\nI'm assuming you are using bash for your script.

With (using an ethernet cable) or without Internet access, nothing is shown except a new Terminal prompt (This is after I had to install dkms using sudo apt-get install dkms ).\nUpdate 3: sudo lshw -C network displays:\n  *-network               \n       description: Network controller\n       product: QCA6164 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       version: 20\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: driver=ath10k_pci latency=0\n       resources: irq:37 memory:f0800000-f09fffff\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: enp2s0\n       version: 10\n       serial: 50:7b:9d:45:9b:62\n       size: 1Gbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full firmware=rtl8168g-3_0.0.1 04/23/13 ip=10.0.0.22 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=1Gbit/s\n       resources: irq:33 ioport:2000(size=256) memory:f0c04000-f0c04fff memory:f0c00000-f0c03fff\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, this means that Ubuntu 16.04 LTS can \"see\" the (integrated) wireless card... It just can't use it.\n\nA: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1436940 is probably what you are looking for.\nProposed fix from this link (step 1 is unnecessary for 16.04):\n2) Get rid of the firmware folder for this card that's included with Ubuntu:\nsudo rm -r /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/\n\n3) Download the latest firmware:\nwget https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/archive/master.zip\n\n4) Unzip the downloaded file. Inside the ath10k-firmware-master folder is a folder named QCA6174. Copy the QCA6174 folder to /lib/firmware/ath10k:\nunzip master.zip\nsudo cp -r ath10k-firmware-master/QCA6174/ /lib/firmware/ath10k/\n\n5) Rename two of the firmware files like so:\ncd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/\nsudo mv firmware-5.bin_SW_RM.1.1.1-00157-QCARMSWPZ-1 firmware-5.bin\ncd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw3.0/\nsudo mv firmware-4.bin_WLAN.RM.2.0-00180-QCARMSWPZ-1 firmware-4.bin\n\n6) Reboot your computer. Run \"lshw -C network\" to see if your card is recognized. You can delete the files you downloaded earlier:\ncd ~\nrm master.zip\nrm -r ath10k-firmware-master/\n\nVerified to work on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (with kernel 4.4.0-21-generic)\nLast updated April 22, 2016\n", "Q: How to use ZFS on Ubuntu 16.04? It seem that Ubuntu 16.04 LTS supports the ZFS filesystem. But how do I use it?\nI'm sorry, I don't know very much about ZFS, but it sounds good. I want it.\n\nA: As root in an Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS this works:\napt update\napt install -y zfs\n\nYou are then done. You can check it is there by doing:\nzfs list\n\nyou can then create a pool by doing:\nzpool create -f zxavi /dev/sdb\n\nor whatever disk you want to use; and after that:\nzpool status\n\nBoom, done!\n\nA: Since I only have 1 reputation, I can neither upvote nor comment on Xavi's answer, which is the correct one. Things not to do include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not waste your time with mountall, all of that Wiki page is obsolete as far as Xenial is concerned;\n\n*Do not install a package named ubuntu-zfs, or use the so-called \"stable\" ZFS PPA.\n\n\nA: First off, use ZFS only if you really want it. See the Use Cases to know if you really need ZFS.\nZFS is supported only in 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 installs. To install it run:\nsudo apt-get install zfsutils-linux\n\nTo learn more, you can see the reference on Ubuntu or this excellent documentation.\nA good introduction can also be found here\n", "Q: Add additional 32bit repositories Can somebody let me know how I can add additional 32bit binaries in my ubuntu machine. or please let me know how I can create new repository. \n\nA: dpkg --add-architecture i386\napt-get update\n\nThat should enable the 32bit libs along 64bit ones.\n", "Q: When an upgrade from 14.04 LTS is convenient or necessary? I am on a perfectly configured and functioning Ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine. \nLTS versions of Ubuntu are supported for 5 years, so in theory there should be no need to upgrade the whole system before the 5 year deadline. I conceive the whole point of having a LTS system the best choice for those like me who prefer to rely on stability for as long as possible, because they develop software or web application for instance: a system upgrade is always a tricky operation.\nConsidering that I am aware that when 2019 comes Ubuntu 14.04 will not be supported any more, and that I certainly will want at that time to extend the life of my system, I still do not understand what possibilities and options am I left with.\nWill in 2019 I be able to upgrade from 14.04 to 18.04 or it is necessary to upgrade gradually, when time comes, from a LTS to the next one? In other words is it necessary now, or in about three months time, to upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04.1 in order to be able to upgrade in 2018 to 18.04?\nWhat is the best and safest choice I can do?\n\nA: I don't know if you'll be able to skip an LTS. I think it most likely you'll need to hop via 16.04. But you can do both those steps in 2019. You don't have to move to 16.04 now. You can, but you don't have to.\nThere may be an upgrade path plan published for 14.04→18.04 so that might be an option, but it doesn't make any difference in practice. Your job is the same. You're going to change the base and you'll need to test your software on it.\nThe important lesson to consider here is you can test whenever you like. Leaving that until 14.04s is dying, and finding out you need to do weeks of improvements is probably a bad idea. Doing an untested upgrade on a production system and then finding out it's broken is much worse.\nThere is nothing stopping you, for example, creating a testing system running whatever version of Ubuntu, that you test on. That will let you know what doesn't work and you can incorporate that into bugfixes, or other plans for when you actually deploy. You can go one further and use \"continuous integration\" techniques to find out where the problems are, as they happen. I'm not sure how appropriate this is for you though.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu 16.04's Snap format secure? A recent leak claims that Ubuntu's new Snap Format is not secure - http://news.softpedia.com/news/developer-claims-that-canonical-s-new-snap-format-isn-t-secure-on-ubuntu-desktop-503287.shtml. Since reading the article, I have been having second thoughts about upgrading. Are there any workarounds available to upgrade.\n\nA: As I understand it, it only means that as long as you use X11 Snap doesn't provide any additional security over using e.g. apt packages. So you will need to remain just as careful about your software sources as before.\nWhen running on Mir, supposedly Snap provides much better isolation between applications (sandboxing), which could provide more security when using software from less trusted sources.\n", "Q: ibus switching between input methods no longer working on 16.04 I just upgraded to 16.04 and use ibus to manage multiple keyboard input methods. When I switch between them using my favorite hotkey combination, the icon changes (indicating that has registered), but the actual keys still correspond to US english (or whatever the default system keyboard layout is). How do I make ibus change keyboard layouts?\n\nA: Just ran into this hiccup when upgrading, and input methods always give me hell whenever I upgrade my distribution, so I thought I'd post the answer here.\nGo into the preferences interface window (via preferences on the panel menu, or alternatively by right clicking the panel icon), navigate to the advanced tab, and then uncheck \"use system keyboard layout\". This will stop your default system layout overriding ibus when you toggle between layouts.\n\nA: I found that ~/.config/ibus/bus owned by root and user can't access it. There should be IBUS_DEMON_PID maintained by daemon. So change the owner and restart PC to populate the relationship. That helped me\n\nA: In my case, I had to remove the additional layouts and then re-add them. It helped.\n", "Q: Backuppc not backing up Windows servers A few days ago, I posted an issue pertaining to backups not running on schedule. \nThe problem was identified and resolved by increasing the \nWakeUpSchedule and MaxBackup settings. \nfor 2 days, the backups worked without any problems. \nThis morning, I opened the WGUI and all of the Windows servers had the message 'backup failed (tar:712 Total bytes received: 0 or some number)\nI can manually start and complete any Linux machine but any Windows machine indicates it starts and then \nfails. \nThe XFerLOG.bad has this little bit of info... \nXfer PIDs are now 56244,56243 \ntar:1236 Getting files newer than Mon Apr 18 19:00:01 2016 \nWARNING: The \"syslog\" option is deprecated \nAny suggestions? \nThank you\n\nA: I had the same issue after a bunch of system updates.

Therefore, xhost has nobody to talk to.  \nYou need to delay execution of your xhost command until after you've logged in. xhost also needs a definition of the DISPLAY environment variable (so it can find the X Server). man X shows the format of DISPLAY: hostname:displaynumber.screennumber.\nAnswer: You cannot run xhost through upstart - the context is not right.\n\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*root is all-powerful, and graphics programs don't show you all that they do.\n\n\n", "Q: dd command failed!

Today I am upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS from Ubuntu 15.10(Wily WereWolf). Xenial is a Galacian word meaning Great. So, just curious, why it's named as Xenial Xerus? Is there some developer after which this name is given or what else the reason be?\nI feel this is not a duplicate of How are release codenames chosen? because @7-R3X's explanation of the history and details why exactly this name helped me. About the codenames, that is a plus information but that still did not help me understand why Xenial Xerus.  So that's why I feel this is not a duplicate.\n\nA: Xenos (ΞΕΝΟΣ) in Greek means \"guest\", \"stranger\", \"friend by way of hospitality\" (in classical Greek), and by extension \"foreign\" (in hellenistic and modern Greek). Zeus was known as Xenios Zeus (Zeus, the protector of guests and god of hospitality). The latter meaning is evident in many words now part of English, such as \"xenophobia\", or even Xenon, the gas.\n\nA: Xenial\n\n“Xenial” means “friendly relations between hosts and guests”, and\n  given all the amazing work going into LXD and KVM for Ubuntu\n  OpenStack, and beyond that the interoperability of Ubuntu OpenStack\n  with hypervisors of all sorts, it seems like a perfect fit.\n\nXerus\n\nThe African ground squirrels, are among the most social animals in my\n  home country.

An update has been issued. If you still cannot install, ensure you have updated fully, and then restart your computer.\n\nI am trying to install downloaded DEB packages. Each time, I see a warning like this:\n\nAnd clicking install just loads and nothing changes.\nThis shows for all the packages I try and install. How can I install a package?\n\nA: This is bug #1573026. Make sure you click the \"this affects me too\".\n\nThis bug has now been fixed upstream. Hopefully an update will be issued promptly.\n\nWhat are the workarounds?\nYou can use the GDebi package manager, available in the software centre or with sudo apt-get install gdebi via the command line.\nThen, to install the package, open GDebi and click File -> Open and navigate to the downloaded DEB file.\n\nIt can take a little while to add the open the package - it took around 10 seconds for me.\nThen check everything is OK, and click install.\n\nIt will finish, and the program will be installed.\n\n\nOr we can use the command line. While apt-get cannot install from a DEB file, all apt-get does is download the file and then call dpkg. We can do those tasks ourselves really simply.\nOpen a terminal and navigate to our download location with cd.\n\nAnd run the command:\nsudo dpkg -i FileName.deb\n\nreplacing FileName with the name of the file.\n\nFinally, run this:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nThis \"fixes\" everything - it resolves all dependencies etc.\n\nA: All .deb files which you manually install are considered to come from 'third party' locations where the system cannot verify the license on the software.  The Google Chrome installer as such originates from Google, a third party, and not the Ubuntu repositories - the warning message here indicates this, but since it can't verify the license terms, it also says it may be non-free.  Google Chrome is still OK to use.\nThe message you see there serves as a warning in the event that you want to make sure it's a 'valid' install or something able to be trusted, and is just a notice that the software doesn't originate from the Ubuntu repositories; it also indicates that some of the software from there may be non-free and may have other license restrictions on it.\nIt is more or less a way to let you know there may be other things to keep in mind - that the software is not Ubuntu-maintained, or may have non-free license restrictions - before you install the software from that .deb file.\nThis is not an error - it's a warning message. You can still click \"Install\" and install the Google Chrome browser or anything else from .deb files at your leisure, as it won't stop you from clicking that \"Install\" button. (except for if there's dependency issues - that's a different, unrelated issue)\n\nIf the new software center isn't working, chances are it's a bug - that message isn't related to it./\nLets go and use the manual method of installing.\nIn the terminal, we can manually install.  I'm assuming you saved the .deb to your user's Downloads folder.  Replace \"PACKAGE\" with the actual filename here.\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/PACKAGE.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nYou should also run apt-get install -f after the dpkg -i just in case there's dependencies that need resolved - apt-get is capable of determining the dependencies issues, but dpkg is not.\n\nA: For me in case of Google Chrome apt-get install -f correctly resolves dependencies only after apt-get update:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable-...-amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nA: I have the same issue and this solve my problem \n 1. change server repository to main \n 2. update system \n 3. restart \n\nA: I had this problem. It appeared that I've installed 32-bit version of Ubuntu by mistake but I thought that I have a 64-bit one.\nSo when I tried to install 64-bit .deb packages I got this problem but when I tried to install 32-bit .deb packages later they have been installed smoothly.\n\nA: First you need to open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) \nThen type: \nsudo apt install gdebi-core\n\nEnter password, then try to reopen app with Ubuntu Software Center.\nIt works for me\n\nA: Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\nType: \nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nPress Enter, put in your password. \nIf it runs with no errors, type:\nsudo apt install gdebi-core\n\nPress Enter. After that I was able to use the Software Center, open it and install all the OS Updates.\n\nA: The simplest which ensures that it can download any dependencies alongside. Which sometimes the gdebi GUI does not download (faced this problem myself).\nInstall gdebi-core by using the following command\nsudo apt install gdebi-core\n\nThen cd in the folder in which your currently your .deb package is on. For example: \ncd ~/debs/\n\nThen use this command to install your application.again with example :-\nsudo gdebi google-chrome-table_51.0.2704.63-1_amd64.deb\n\nThis should download dependencies if needed and will install your app successfully.\n", "Q: “sudo ecryptfs-recover-private” gives “find: ‘/run/user/1000/gvfs’: Permission denied” after botched (?) upgrade EDIT 1: I reinstalled 16.04 having booted through the CD but with the HDD installed, now I can read the \"readme.txt\" and I can click on the \"access-your-private-data.desktop\" and it seems to run for a few minutes without a window opening and then it stops.

Also, does it matter what the host OS is?\n\nA: Yes, it can. You have to enable it, through.

Click to focus specifically seems to be bugged on GNOME applications. I can get the windows to be active by clicking on the title bar, but I cannot simply click anywhere in the window.\nI can \"work around\" this issue by changing the raise behavior to \"sloppy\" or \"mouse\" but those solutions do not work for me because I constantly move the mouse to the side of a window or work with windows on top of one another and sloppy and mouse constantly do what I do not want them to do, which is raise a window and make it active by having my mouse over it.\nMore than not being raised, they also seem to not really be \"active\", as trying to type in those windows results in the input being in the raised window. I can drag and drop a file/icon into a nautilus window and it works, but if I select files with my mouse and try to ctrl+v them, they will not be copied.\nAny help?\n\nA: I was having problems with \"click focus\" as well, mainly with Chrome (not using system title bar) and Guake and what did the trick for me was setting from dconf-editor, org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences values as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*auto-rise: on\n\n*focus-mode: click\n\n*focus-new-windows: strict (*)\n\n*mouse-button-modifier: default\n\n\n(*) It seems to affect the focus behaviour of windows with no title bar (such as Google Chrome and Guake).\nHope it helps.\nEdit: Ubuntu 16.04 w/ Gnome-shell 3.18.4\n\nA: I was just tinkering with this a bit more and solved my own problem. I had messed with some of the settings in Ubuntu Tweak Tool and it seems unrelated but disabling the 'mouse-modifier-button' was causing the windows not to raise unless clicking the titlebar. Setting this value back to default '' fixed the raise issue.\nOpen dconf-editor and navigate to org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences and make sure mouse-modifier-button and raise-on-click are both set to default. If that doesn't do it, maybe another setting in there is not default and causing your issue.\n\nA: Use Alt+click.\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: Use alt+` switch between same application\n\nA: had the same exact issue when \"Window Action Key\" was set to \"Disabled\"\nsetting that to \"Alt\" or \"Super\" made it focus normally only click\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 OpenVPN When I choose the Connection Type in VPN Connections, I have only PPTP and I can't find OpenVPN, but I already installed it via terminal with the command sudo apt-get install openvpn easy-rsa\nWhy I can't find it?\n\nA: To get the VPN connection to show up in Network Manager, ensure that all these packages are installed:\nnetwork-manager-openvpn\nnetwork-manager-openvpn-gnome\nnetwork-manager-pptp\nnetwork-manager-vpnc\n\nIt may be overkill but it works.\nEven with this, it worked a little flakey on 16.04.

AMD put a lot of work into the drivers, and we backported kernel code from Linux 4.5 to provide a better experience.\nWhen upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 from a previous release, both the fglrx driver and the xorg.conf will be removed, so that the system is set to use either the amdgpu driver or the radeon driver (depending on the available hardware).\nMore information is available at https://tjaalton.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/no-catalystfglrx-video-driver-in-ubuntu-16-04/\n\n\nA: fglrx is not available in 16.04.

It complains that 'vboxdrv' isn't loaded. So I try to load it and get the following error:\n$ sudo modprobe vboxdrv\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vboxdrv': Required key not available\n\nI believe it is related to secure boot which I use and which I want to continue using. Actually with Ubuntu 15.10 secure boot and VirtualBox were working just fine.\nAlso I tried $ sudo apt-get --reinstall install virtualbox-dkms which built the kernel module successfully but didn't solve this issue.\nAny idea how to get vboxdrv loaded while keeping secure boot enabled?\nUpdate 2: Also I tried executing sudo mokutil --disable-validation. When executing this command, during the next boot I get prompted to disable secure boot, add a key or hash from disk. Since I don't want to disable secure boot, it seems that this doesn't solve my issue either. Also I want to keep UEFI activated for a parallel Windows installation.\nNote: If you don't mind disabling secure boot, see Why do I get \"Required key not available\" when install 3rd party kernel modules or after a kernel upgrade? instead.\n\nA: You can disable the validation check by\nsudo apt install mokutil\nsudo mokutil --disable-validation\n\nAfter that DKMS packages should install.\n\nA: I know that this question is too old, but because there is no accepted answer and none of these answers solved the issue in my case, I am writing how I solved this today without disabling the Secure Boot:\nWhen running this command, get this error:\n$ sudo modprobe vboxdrv\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vboxdrv': Required key not available\n\nThe problem is that the module is not signed and therefore not loaded with the kernel.

Then add it to the kernel:\nsudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vboxdrv)\n\n4. Register it for the Secure Boot. \nIMPORTANT! That will ask you for a password, put the one you want, you will only have to use it once in the next reboot.\nsudo mokutil --import MOK.der\n\n5. Finally, restart the computer.

But there was problem with old version (5.0.14) of Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. I downloaded and installed newer version (5.0.18) of this pack and problem disappeared.\n\nA: I had the same issue today, I had Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10 on a dual boot with uefi enabled on Bios (I didn't disable it so I can run the pre-installed Windows).\nAfter upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 VirtualBox stopped loading my VMs with the same error message:\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vboxdrv': Required key not available\n\nI suspected UEFI issue because while upgrading the installer asked me if I want to disable it, to which I responded No (Because Yes may make my Windows unusable).\nWhat I did is going to Bios and enable support for legacy BIOS boot WITHOUT disabling secure boot.\nVirtualbox works fine now.\nUpdate: As @zwets rightly pointed in the comment, enabling legacy modules causes secure boot to be disabled.\n\nA: Alright so after a bit of testing I'm pretty sure this is a secure boot issue. \nAs in if it's enabled then this is thrown: \n\nWARNING: The vboxdrv kernel module is not loaded.

The one issue I can't seem to get past or over is that when I use the Fn keys to change the brightness, it results in random flickering during which, the brightness bar moves in either direction or at times it stays put. \nIf I change the brightness via the slider in System settings, it works fine (but should it allow reduction to a zero i.e. blackout?). \nI have already tried creating the intel file in xorg.conf.d, here's the output for:\n~$ ls /sys/class/backlight\nacpi_video0  intel_backlight\n\nThe flickering and the output has led me to think about the possibility that the Fn keys seem to be commanding two drivers at once?\n\nA: I was able to find a fix for it. Not fully satisfied, but technically the issue is fixed. Here, I blogged about it.\n\nUpdate: The original blog is down. Its content can still be found on archive.org though. Below is a quotation of the linked content's key parts:\n\nAfter googling further on this, I landed on this page and I saw the list of kernel parameters that had to do with the backlight. I rebooted a couple of times, each time trying a different parameter, and finally,\n  acpi_backlight=native is what did the trick. I noticed that it doesn’t allow me to change brightness on login screen, but after login, there was no flickering, and when I ran ls /sys/class/backlight/, I saw that it no longer returned acpi_video0. The only issue I have right now is that there is no fixed minimum. Sometimes, it decreases to a reasonable minimum, while at other times, it results in a blackout, and I have to manually adjust it using the slider in system settings or using xbrightness..\nTo replicate this process, all you need to do:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Fire up a terminal\n  \n*sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n  \n*At the very end of the string GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, (which in my case was quiet splash) add acpi_backlight=native.\n  The final string, in my case, looks like quiet splash acpi_backlight=native\n  \n*Close and save the file, and run sudo update-grub and then reboot.\n  \n  \n  In the event that this doesn’t work, it’d be worth your time to try out the rest of the kernel parameters. You don’t have to modify the grub file every time. Instead you can choose to modify kernel parameters before boot. This you can do by pressing “c” on the grub screen and typing the desired parameter, in the correct place, right after “splash.”\n\n", "Q: Why absolute path doesn't work for binary execution?

Clearly there is some issues with the upgrade procedure.\n\nA: I ran into similar problem of longer boot time after upgrade.\nWhat was the problem?\nI had deleted my swap space, so my /etc/fstab file and new file system had conflicts. \nThe Boot loader waited for almost 1m 30s to find it.\nHow I solved the problem\nRun\nsudo blkid\nOpen your /etc/fstab file and compare the uuid's match with partitions you have.

DefaultRestartSec= defaults to 100ms.\n\nEdit - More in detail:\nI analyzed the boot sequence with systemd-analyze plot > sequence.svg that showed services failing to start on my freshly upgraded OS. There were three - one was a misconfigured sendmail daemon then powerd.service & NetworkManager-wait-online.service. Since it's not a good idea to disable the NetworkManager service entirely I just let it timeout after 10 secs and applied this rule globally.\n\nA: This could be related to filesystem issues.

Everything looks normal again.\n\nA: My first attempt,I just run sudo do-release-upgrade on 14.04 LTS failed badly, completely blank and dead, no network, no console, no grub menu at boot, nothing. I had to boot from liveUSB and revert to previous btrfs snapshot (well, that is really good idea IMHO, to have a snapshot ready for such case). \nAnyway, I suspect that it may be just a problem with my pc, sometimes setting display to sleep that is impossible to wake up. It did happen sometimes on my 14.04, and upgrade may got stuck with some kind of question in the middle of progress, that was impossible to answer. I had to perform cold reboot and that may be reason.\nMy second attempt went much better. But it went installing 15.10 Willy first, and ended somehow unsure with errors - unmet dependencies.\nI have avoided the display sleep this time so I had an option to run sudo apt-get install -f to fix that, and then, I have attempted to run sudo do-release upgrade again and this time it took Xenial 16.04 LTS and finished OK. It preserved all user settings, mounts, vnc  and so on - just perfect.\nThere is setting of update-manager whether it should offer version upgrade, and perhaps You have \"LTS version only\" there (or \"never\") - it may result in \"no new release found\" IMHO, since direct 14.04 to 16.04 is not supported yet.. Try to put \"for any new version\" there and let it upgrade to Willy first.\nBut I must repeat that using btrfs snapshots (working well on Trusty), or any other but good enough backup, is good idea when trying such upgrade.\n\nA: Start on recovery mode, and press alt+f1\nWrite \napt install grub\nAnd finally\nSudo dpkg --configure -a\nThis will fix any possible upgrading error.\nIt worked for me after a lot of unsuccessfully trying other stuff.

It reduces most screen tearing. \nIn Nvidia X Server settings (nvidia-settings) go to PRIME Profiles and select Intel (Power Saving Mode). Alternatively sudo prime-select intel. \nI'm using nvidia-370, which is the current official release, with Nvidia 940MX. It seems like ironically their driver is still worse than Intel drivers.

Is there some configuration file where the mappings are stored and I can edit them manually?\nedit: I found out where the button mappings are in dconf, but manually changing a mapping to something like Ctrl or Shift doesn't do anything\n\nA: For me the following call to xsetwacom worked:\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Cintiq 13HD Pad pad\" Button 2 key \"Shift_L\"\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Cintiq 13HD Pad pad\" Button 3 key \"Control_L\"\n\nHolding Button 2 to add to a selection etc. in inkscape works for me like this. I put this in the same shell script I use to map the cursor and execute it once when I have the tablet attached.\nThere are also ways to automate this but I have not tried this yet.\n\nA: I had the same problem as I wanted to use the my tablet with Krita.\nThe only solution I found is a workaround: I changed the shortcuts in Krita. \nSo instead of using Shift + left drag to change the Brush size, I mapped the shortcut Shift+B +  left drag in Krita to do the job, then I mapped Shift+B to one of the buttons of my tablet and it works fine now. \nSame for Ctrl + left click, I mapped B + left click in Krita.\n", "Q: 16.04 upgrade broke mysql-server My overall upgrade went well, but I am left with a critically lingering issue of mysql-server not being able to install itself, and nothing I am trying gets it to work.\nThis is the error I see when trying to install/reinstall it:\nSetting up mysql-server-5.7 (5.7.11-0ubuntu6) ...\nJob for mysql.service failed because the control process exited with error code.

Any suggestions on what I can do to fix this would be most welcome.\nEDIT:\nLooks like I'm not the only one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.7/+bug/1573279\n\nA: Today I got the same problem, after trying many solutions i found that the problem was the command sudo systemctl disable mysql.service that i used to disable MySQL auto starting, so to get it working i re-enabled again MySQL server using the command sudo systemctl enable mysql.service and run again the upgrade process and it terminated perfectly.\n\nA: In my case, with strace, I saw that /var/run/mysqld/ didn't exist and mysqld can't create the file mysqld.sock.\nThese commands solved my problem:\nmkdir /var/run/mysqld\nchown mysql.mysql /var/run/mysqld\nchmod 700 /var/run/mysqld\n\nNow:  \nsystemctl start mysql\n\nAnd mysql works again :)\n\nA: In my case I could solv the problem by adding\n# Allow log file access\n/home/system/var/log/mysql.err rw,\n/home/system/var/log/mysql.log rw,\n/home/system/var/log/mysql/ r,\n/home/system/var/log/mysql/** rw,\n\nto /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysqld\nFor more details take a look at my answer (by ChristophS) at stackoverflow.\n\nA: Your error message contains this line:\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\n\nHowever, this installed post-installation script is not mentioned by name. After much tinkering, I found out that its name is (in my case) /var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.7.postinst. \nOpen this file with sudo vi /var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.7.postinst, or your preferred editor.\nAt the top, change line 3 (or so): set -e to set -x, save the file. (option -e is \"exit on errors\", -x means \"explicitly show command executed\", presumably)\nRun sudo dpkg --configure -a --log /tmp/dpkg.log\n(the --log option is optional). You can also simply run apt upgrade if you know it'll be the only package that will be upgraded.\nNow you get verbose output of the mysql-server-5.7.postinst bash script, and you can figure out what's wrong.\nIn my case it unsuccessfully tried to (re-)run mysql_upgrade, but that was not needed for my customized mysql installation. I was sure I've run it manually before, successfully, and all was well.\nSo I commmented out line 321 (for older mysqld releases try line 281),\n#mysql_upgrade --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf || result=$?\nand the command that has failed before, sudo apt upgrade (run it again),  finished successfully, and dpkg removed the error status for this package.\nNow you can set back the set -x to set -e (mentioned above). And optionally uncomment the mysql-upgrade line.\nExtra work might be required if you have moved your mysql data partition to a nonstandard location. I moved mine from /var/lib/mysql/data to a different drive via symlink. Then you might have to remove the symbolic link temporarily, before the postinst script manipulation. Then re-create it after running the package upgrade.\nAfter the next minor version upgrade of the mysqld debian package, this problem with the /var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.7.postinst script can show up again.\n\nA: The instructions here fixed it on my server: https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=72722\n\nI can understand the pain of having your system in inconsistent state\n  but lets not worry about the whole situation and take it step by step\n  to get the system clean.\nFirst lets see the current state of all the mysql packages on machine\n  using: dpkg -l | grep mysql (Please paste the output excluding last\n  column)\nThe first column denotes the current status of the package. Here are\n  the possible options:\nii) Installed rc) Removed config-files kept (This should be the state\n  of all the packages you have removed with 'apt-get remove' that does\n  not remove config-files under /etc)\nFor this to work, you will need to run 'apt-get purge <pkg-name>' till\n  you do not see any packages in the above list.\nPlease remember that some non-mysql-server packages like\n  python-mysql.connector and python-mysqldb, if installed, need not be\n  removed as they do not have any affect on this situation but if\n  removed might cause trouble to applications using them.\nWe will definitely try to re-visit our docs to see how can we\n  safeguard users from getting into this trouble. Thanks for sharing\n  your feedback in detail with us.\n\n\nA: The instructions @andrew-beerman posted are on the right track, though they aren't quite clear to me and seem  to recommend more than is necessary. I pieced together the answer from the above and a helpful post in the bug thread.\nThese are the steps I took to correct this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your my.cnf file in /etc/mysql and remove or rename it\nsudo mv /etc/mysql/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf.bak\n\n\n*Remove the folder /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/ using \nsudo rm -r /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/\n\n\n*Verify you don't have a my.cnf file stashed somewhere else (I did in my home dir!) or in /etc/alternatives/my.cnf use \nsudo find / -name my.cnf\n\n\n*Backup and remove /etc/mysql/debian.cnf files (not sure if needed, but just in case)\nsudo mv /etc/mysql/debian.cnf /etc/mysql/debian.cnf.bak\nsudo apt purge mysql-server mysql-server-5.7 mysql-server-core-5.7\nsudo apt install mysql-server\n\n\n*In case your syslog shows an error like \"mysqld: Can't read dir of '/etc/mysql/conf.d/'\" create a symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d /etc/mysql/conf.d\n\nThen the service should be able to start with sudo service mysql start.\nThat got it working!\n\nA: I had the same issue. I tried to re-install mysql several times, but had no success.\nI figured out that the problem for me was, that another mysql process was already running.\nIn details:\nAfter I read carefully logs in /var/log/mysql/error.log, and found:\n\n[ERROR] Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in\n  use\n[ERROR] Do you already have another mysqld server running on port:\n  3306 ?\n\nLooks like another application was using already the port.\nI checked it using ps -aux | grep 3306:\n$ ps -aux | grep 3306\nmilkovs+  6802  0.0  0.0  16336  1084 pts/19   S+   21:39   0:00 grep --color=auto 3306\nmysql    14706  0.0  0.3 1270192 13916 pts/2   Sl   Aug19   0:29 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --plugin-dir=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin --user=mysql --skip-grant-tables --log-error=/var/log/mysql/error.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --port=3306 --log-syslog=1 --log-syslog-facility=daemon --log-syslog-tag=\n\nAnd I killed the running process sudo kill -15 14706\nThen I started mysql: /etc/init.d/mysql start\nFinally mysql works for me! I hope it helps somebody.\n\nA: For WSl Ubuntu 16.04 version I found this helpful article here\nSteps to follow to resolved\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo vi /var/lib/dpkg/info/mysql-server-5.7.postinst\n\n*Look for this line mysql_upgrade --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf || result=$? \n\n*Add this service mysql restart directly above line in number 2.\n\n*Save and run this sudo dpkg --configure -a\nit should look like\nservice mysql restart\nmysql_upgrade --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf || result=$?  \n\nHope this help\n\nA: None of the answers on this page worked for me.\nI ended up going to the Oracle downloads page, downloading mysql-apt-config_0.8.8-1_all.deb, and installing MySQL from Oracle repo:\nsudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.8-1_all.deb\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install mysql-server\n\n\nA: I have had the issue on a few servers now\nThe fix was to run\napt install phpmyadmin --reinstall\nwhich resolved the above (with no need to touch mysql afterwards) \n", "Q: Is it possible to install Flash on Aquaris M10 tablet? I would like to watch videos on bbc.co.uk/news and this currently requires Flash. A the moment Firefox does not work well on the tablet (the touch keyboard does not come up so can't search) but I'm not clear as to whether the default browser will support flash.\na) is it possible to add the multiverse repository so that I can install the Mozilla Firefox plugin that I have installed on by Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - assuming that Firefox can/will be made to work better for touch? I tried editing the repositories file but even with sudo it said it was read only.\nb) is it at all possible to install flash for the default Aquaris M10 browser?\nc) is Flash dead and I just need to wait for the BBC to update their website to use HTML5 video technology?\n\nA: In the specific case of the bbc.co.uk website you can watch all their video content by going to this address:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/html5\nand choosing 'opt-in' to their HTML5 Player beta.\n \nIf you then go to the iPlayer you should be able to watch any of their videos in the Ubuntu Web Browser without any problems.\nI've been able to do this from Ubuntu on a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 7 (2013) and it works pretty darn well and should also work with videos on the rest of their site too.\nCan't remember how I first heard about them having this option, but it wasn't well advertised by the BBC site itself.\nIt might be worth doing a web search for other media sites you want to use to see if they have a similar HTML5 beta too. \n\nA: *\n\n*The bq M10 user manual says Firefox doesn't support a soft keyboard because it is meant for PC mode only.\n\n*You need to mount the root filesystem read / write to edit those files as follows: \nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*Flash is not for ARM and only an old version is supported for Firefox for a limited time (somewhere 2017 it will be gone)\n\n*so yeah flash is indeed kind of dead\n\n", "Q: Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Randomly Freezes on Ubuntu 16.04 I have a Lenovo ThinkPad 11e (with the Intel chipset not the AMD), that used to experience freezes randomly under 14.04 which have persisted after a clean install of 16.04.\nDescription of the freezes that occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen freezes in place with no distortion\n\n*Hardware buttons become unresponsive (lights in the mute sound/mic keys no longer toggle when pressed)\n\n*A hard restart is the only way to fix the freeze\n\n*There is absolutely no warning before a freeze occurs, the system acts normally right up until it locks up\n\n\nThe issue seems to appear more frequently when I run anything related to Chrome/Chromium on my system (including stuff that uses the Electron framework, e.g. the Atom editor). But it will still occur even if nothing related to those is running. It also doesn't seem to be related to stress on the system because I can run Windows 10 in VMWare Workstation 12 without any issue.\nI'm not even sure where I should begin looking in for clues as to what's causing the issue, so I was hoping someone here might have an idea. When the issue occurs the entire computer becomes unresponsive and I have to hard shut down. I'm not sure what logs would have any information related to a hard system freeze.\nI have tried using linux-crashdump as suggested by Chris J Arges, but even after replicating my problem twice I have found no crash entries in /var/crash other than those from forcing a kernel crash to make sure it was working\nPossibly relevant information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The integrated Intel graphics show up as Intel Bay Trail (which I know has had some problems with Linux in the past)\n\n*I have upgraded the system to 8 GB of RAM (the issue occurred before this change as well)\n\n*My system has an SSD formatted to ext4 (the issue occurred using btrfs as well)\n\n*I have run multiple hardware diagnostic tests (both built-in BIOS tests and from bootable utilities), that have found no issues with my hardware\n\n\nA: Try installing newer kernels. In some cases, it fixes the problem of freezing that caused by bad high precision timer code. This is binary for Linux 4.5.2:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.5.2-wily/\nDownload appropriate 3 .deb binary packages, install them, and reboot to the new kernel. I hope this will fix your problm. By the way, Ubuntu 16.04 is alraedy out with a new kernel, so do a clean install (not an upgrade) and see if it fixes your problem.\n\nA: See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109051\nThe following eliminated the problem for me.\nEdit /etc/default/grub. Change the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"intel_idle.max_cstate=1 quiet splash\"\n\nthen do\nsudo update-grub\n\nand reboot.\n\nA: There isn't enough information to diagnose this so you should file a bug. I'm assuming when you mention 'freeze' the computer needs to be completely power cycled to use it again. With that it is most likely a kernel issue. The following link explains how to file a bug against the Ubuntu kernel:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Bugs\nAnother approach is to use linux-crashdump to try and capture the failure when it happens. Instructions are here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/CrashdumpRecipe\nFinally you could try installing the latest mainline kernel to see if this fixes the issue. This would be useful information to report in the bug as well:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/daily/current/\n\nA: In your possible relevant issues, you mentioned:\n\nThe integrated Intel graphics show up as Intel Bay Trail (which I know has had some problems with Linux in the past)\n\nHere's my personal experience. I have had a similar issue. It was an NVidia GT820M Card. I always had issue using the proprietary drivers from Nvidia\n\nWhat fixed it for me was using Nouveau Xorg drivers instead. I would switch between them to confirm that was the culprit. The same symptoms as yours would happen. PC will stop responding in the middle of anything anytime without any warning whatsoever. And Chrome browser or Sublime would trigger the freeze easily too.\nIf you happen to be using a proprietary VGA driver for your PC, switch to an open source version, preferably the nouveau.\nAnd this my experience happened on an Ubuntu i7 15.04. The issue is long gone, and I am free now, but from all you describe I'm happy to put 20 points bounty on the VGA drivers as the culprit \n\nA: I was experiencing the same problem on an ASUS N56JN (also Intel chipset). This worked for me:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-building-installing-a-custom-linux-kernel/\nIt basically explains how update the kernel to the latest version, goes step by step on how to download, compile and install the latest version of the Linux kernel (4.5).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software will not install my VPN service In Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu Software installer will not install my paid VPN service.

Some random search result from Google looks like this:\n\nIn terminal it says Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file few times. What the problem can be?\n\nA: For some reason Chrome keeps defaulting to Noto Sans CJK Thin.\nSimplest solution is to replace the NotoSans font bundled with Ubuntu with just the regular weight.\nIdea sparked by noto-sans-cjk-thin-font-issue\nIn short: \n\n\n*\n\n*download\nhttps://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc.zip\n\n*chmod 644 on the downloaded font\n\n*replace /usr/share/fonts/opentype/noto/NotoSansCJK.ttc with the downloaded version\n\n\nBenefit: no thin browser font rendering.\nDrawback: no font weights other than regular!\n\nA: I use another work-around: in chromium settings -> customize fonts, change \"standard font\" to use \"Noto Sans CJK\", like me use \"Noto Sans CJK SC\";\n\nA: I reported the bug. According to the discussion it could be something related to fontconfig or the internal font fallback mechanism of Chrome.\nAnyways, I seemed to temporarily solve it by removed the package via apt-get and downloading NotoSansCJK directly from Google, which contains fonts of different weights in separate files. After installing the fonts manually this issue seems to be fixed, and Chrome is able to render CJK correctly even though I didn't change my default fonts in Chrome.\n", "Q: How to fix error W: Target Packages (main/binary-amd64/Packages) is configured multiple times in my sources.list file?

between --init-file and --rcfile? I've been working with bash, and I came across the --rcfile and --init-file options. Bash's man page lists these under the same section, but they seem to behave differently. Take the following scenario:\nI have created a ~/.bash_profile which has the following command:\nexec env -i <variables> /bin/bash <option> ~/.bashrc\n\nfor the purposes of a project which require the terminal to open with a specific configuration; it is instructed not to read /etc/bash.bashrc and instead only read from ~/.bashrc. If <option> is --init-file, ~/.bashrc is read without error. However, --rcfile in its place does not appear to source the file.\nWhat is the difference between these two seemingly identical commands?\n\nA: They are synonymous.\nFrom the shell.c file of bash-4.3 source:\nlong_args[] = {\n....\n  { \"init-file\", Charp, (int *)0x0, &bashrc_file },\n....\n  { \"rcfile\", Charp, (int *)0x0, &bashrc_file },\n....\n};\n\nAs you can see they are defined the same way and also works the same way.\nThe parameter bashrc_file stores the filename.\nFor further assurance, the CHANGES file in the source contains:\n\nAdded a new '--init-file' invocation argument as a synonym for\n  '--rcfile', per the new GNU coding standards.\n\n", "Q: System freezes when apt-get tries to unpack a particular package I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nEach time I run an APT or dpkg command, it does what it supposed to do until it come to the package masalla-icon-theme (which I'm not using anymore).

I really appreciate any help.\nMy system has 2 4k screens running off of a Radeon R7 370 graphics card, one is connected to the HDMI output and the other to the Display Port.\nThanks.\n\nA: There are a few things that you can do:\n1) try a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, if you didn't do that(updating without wiping all data could cause problems)\n2) try using the radeonsi driver instead of the amdgpu one (I read that the amdgpu one is mostly for newer AMD cards such as R9 380,285 etc)\nI had similar problem with my AMD graphics card, I have dual monitor setup, and after install, only one monitor worked.

You may not like this. I'm not sure what generation that card you have is... But if it's not basically brand new, you're gonna have a bad time. AMD has been working on an open source replacement for fglrx for a while now (and want everyone to use the open source one they just released, but this one only works with the newest generation of AMD cards), and with the release of an LTS Ubuntu, decided that they didn't want to support an older driver for 3 more years. Your choices (if that card is not the newest generation) are:\nStay on 15.10\nOr\nUse the horrible older AMD open source drivers (basically means you can't play games or do any sort of graphics work)\nOr\nBuy a newer AMD card. \nI like these choices as much as you do, seeing as how I'm in the same situation.

For this purpose I am using a backup GUI tool.\nI would like to mount the samba share to a mount point on the source system (e.g. using /etc/fstab or eventually using a command line). This is not too difficult.\nHowever what happens if the other PC isn't available? The mount point then would be a plain folder and I would flood my small local disk with backup files instead of copying to the remote share.\nThis once happened to me with an unavailable local disk. However with a second system this accident is much more likely.\nHow can I prevent that disaster?\n\nA: I could solve this by removing any writing rights from the dummy mount point folder. This way, copying files fails if mounting was not successful. For changing the access rights I used Dolphin's context menu.\n\nA: I asked a very similar question on serverfault some years ago: https://serverfault.com/q/337602/14942.\nThere are 5 ways that I thought of, with some additional variations left as an exercise for the reader.\nChoices, assuming the backup filesystem is to be mounted at /mnt/backups:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor /mnt/backups and ensure it's not root. Perhaps a cron job.\n\n*Move the mount point into a smaller separately mounted filesystem. Use /mnt/protected/backups instead, and mount /protected first to a small filesystem, perhaps a loop mount to a local file so it is much less likely to fail.\n\n*Chmod a-rwx /mnt/backups (the root filesystem mount point). (This is the currently accepted answer.)\n\n*On the mounted tree create a directory called \"Backups\", then soft link ln - s /mnt/backup/Backups /Backups. Using /Backups for backups will fail unless the /mnt/backup is mounted, since the local tree doesn't contain the sub-directory.\n\n*Performing a check that the directory is correctly mounted in the backup script.

Before and after the upgrade I have two \"ubuntu\" boot options in my BIOS. Here you can see the values behind each entry under xenial:\nstephane@nausicaa:~$ sudo efibootmgr -v\nBootCurrent: 0002\nTimeout: 0 seconds\nBootOrder: 0002,0000\nBoot0000  ubuntu        HD(1,GPT,xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx,0x800,0x64000)/File(\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi)\nBoot0002* ubuntu        HD(1,GPT,xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx,0x800,0x64000)/File(EFI\\Ubuntu\\grubx64.efi)\n\nWith wily I have been using shimx64 (first entry) and the NVIDIA proprietary driver without issues. Since the upgrade to xenial shimx64 (first entry) doesn't load the NVIDIA proprietary driver. I have to use grubx64 instead (second entry).\nWhen I use grubx64 I find the following entries for \"nvidia\" or \"NVRM\" in the kernel log:\nnvidia: module license 'NVIDIA' taints kernel.\nnvidia: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel\n[drm] Initialized nvidia-drm 0.0.0 20150116 for 0000:01:00.0 on minor 0\nNVRM: loading NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  340.96  Sun Nov  8 22:33:28 PST 2015\nnvidia_uvm: Loaded the UVM driver, major device number 245\nNVRM: Your system is not currently configured to drive a VGA console\nNVRM: on the primary VGA device.

Does anyone has an explanation for what happens there? Could it have something to do with digital signature of the drivers?\n\nA: NVIDIA does not sign its proprietary video driver. The Linux kernel always checks for signatures in kernel modules, even with secure boot disabled. When I use grubx64 I can see this message:\nkernel: nvidia: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel\n\nThis is not an error since secure boot is disabled; the NVIDIA proprietary video driver still works. The funny part is that when I use shimx64 this message does not appear. The NVIDIA driver is skipped by the kernel without any message. I can tell that secure boot is enabled because of this message:\nkernel: Secure boot enabled\n\n", "Q: How to make installation stick having storage partition I'd like to create USB stick having both:\na) Ubuntu 16.04 installer,\nb) storage partition.\nSo I can boot a computer with it, install or just start Ubuntu and be able to copy data from computer drives to the storage part.\n\"Startup Disc Creator\" makes two partitions: first ISO Joliet about 1.5 GB, second FAT32 EFI 25MB, and leaves rest as unused.

When you start Startup Disc Creator and select the USB you desire to make bootable, you will see two selectable options on the bottom part of window. Itreads something like:\nWhen starting from this disk, documants will be stored in reserved extra space... (select this option). You can set how much of this extra space you wish to create. Be sure not to select the option bellow that reads:\nDiscarded on shutdown unless stored elsewhere.\nAnyhow, the space on the USB key that is not occupied with OS image and this extra space is still usable for transfering data, as if the USB key would be \"normal\" USB key (I mean \"not bootable\"). But if you boot into live sesion from this key and wish to save something, this will be saved in the extra space you have created and not on the unused part.\n", "Q: PHP rendered as text after Ubuntu 16.04 upgrade Apache is rendering PHP files as text after Ubuntu 16.04 upgrade.\nApache is installed and running.\nPHP7 is running.

You need to recompile PHP I did find some help in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Apache_HTTP_Server regarding this issue, however the file paths didn't match the ones in Ubuntu, so I didn't try to apply the recommended fix.\n\nA: The php command is provided by php7.0-cli package on Ubuntu 16.04.  Running the CLI is orthogonal to the web server configuration.\nYou need to install and configure one of the web SAPIs - apache2, fpm or cgi.  The most easy is to install apache2 SAPI.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install apache2 SAPI, run apt-get install libapache2-mod-php (this will pull the default PHP version, currently libapache2-mod-php7.0).  The package should enable itself and switch to apache2 prefork MPM that's the only MPM supported.  If not, try to run a2enmod php7.0 and look for errors.  The installation should switch from event MPM to prefork MPM automatically, but if it doesn't, you can switch it manually by doing sudo a2dismod mpm_event followed by sudo a2enmod mpm_prefork. \n\n*To install FPM SAPI, run apt-get install php-fpm and then enable FPM by running a2enconf php7.0-fpm.  The FPM SAPI is more secure, but harder to configure correctly.\n\n*To install CGI SAPI, run apt-get install php-cgi and then enable CGI by running a2enconf php7.0-cgi.  Please not that CGI is not recommended way how to run PHP, but it might come handy in special deployments.\n\nA: I made mine running again by installing libapache2-mod-php7.0. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I also got bitten by this issue in a different way: \nBy default PHP scripts will not run in user directories.\nSo if your server supports public_html in the users' home folder and want to let users run php in it, you should remove the part in php7.0.conf that disables it. \n\nA: In the latest Apache 2.0, for Ubuntu 16.04.2 I found that Apache is pre-configured with threads enabled, but the default PHP 7 is not. If the PHP is not compiled with threadsafe, you will need to switch to the prefork MPM, which does not use threads.\nTo do this, first disable:\nsudo a2dismod mpm_event \n\nThen enable:\nsudo a2enmod mpm_prefork \n\nYou must do this in the right order as they are mutually exclusive.\nThen restart Apache:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nYou should be good to go without issues now.\n", "Q: How to downgrade from 15.10 to 14.04 My current Ubuntu version is 15.10 and I'm not satisfied with it...

This issue does not stop you from upgrading packages.\nYou are using apt-get and what you are seeing is the normal behavior after running update: it performs the update but does not provide additional information.\nYou need to follow sudo apt-get update with sudo apt-get upgrade to see if any package upgrades are available.\nThe newer sudo apt update (notice it's just apt) does provide feedback about the results.\nBy using apt, you will either see a message that \nAll packages are up to date\n\nor\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n\nAlso see apt list --upgradeable.\n\nA: To avoid this error, you can remove the repository.\n\nPlease note that removing the repository will prevent Chrome from getting any updates, including important security updates!\n  This will make your browser vulnerable to an increasing number of threats over time!\nIf you really want to entirely remove or disable the repository, you should consider uninstalling Chrome and moving on to a different browser, like its open-source variant chromium.\nThis note was added by ByteCommander.\n\nAt first search for Software and Updates in the Dash.

Repositories missing these need to be fixed by their owners.\nThere is an overview of broken repositories in the Debian wiki.\n\nA: As @chaskes says this is a problem with the repository not with your computer. \n@webwurst has good links to the underlying problem. There's also a clarification about the signatures. \nIf you are hosting a repository which is giving these errors. The solution is to change the default cert-digest-algo to be SHA256. By default gnupg defaults to using SHA1\nAfter you fix this issue the next warning will be that the signature \"uses weak digest algorithm (SHA1)\" And to fix that you can set digest-algo to SHA256 as well. \nThese values go on the repository server in the gpg.conf which the repository is using.\nThe short hand is to append\ncert-digest-algo SHA256\ndigest-algo SHA256\n\nto your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file. \nOur project has it ticketed here which should have an example of how to fix it for our deployment mechanism.\n", "Q: Security of snaps under X11 With snaps coming to 16.04 LTS, there is a blog post by Matthew Garrett, a well known Linux kernel contributor and core OS developer, saying:\n\n...snaps are running unconfined and have access to pretty much the entire system\n\nIf the point of having snaps was to enforce app isolation from the whole system, why are they able to access the system and run unconfined? Should a bug report be filed? Are any steps going to be taken to address this problem? \n\nA: This specifically relates to snaps that use X11. In other words, snaps are not running unconfined, but if the confinement of the snap includes access to X, then yeah: it has access to X. It does not involve snaps that don't use the unity7 or x11 interfaces. The issue described in that blog post is a well-known limitation of X, and is one of the reasons alternative technologies are being developed (e.g. Mir).\nGustavo Niemeyer has written a good blog post that discusses this. I'll quote here for posterity and completeness:\n\nThe security minded will observe that X11 is not in fact a secure protocol. A number of system abuses are possible when we hand an application this permission. Other interfaces such as home would give the snap access to every non-hidden file in the user’s $HOME directory (those that do not start with a dot), which means a malicious application might steal personal information and send it over the network (assuming it also defines a network plug).\nSome might be surprised that this is the case, but this is a misunderstanding about the role of snaps and Snappy as a software platform. When you install software from the Ubuntu archive, that’s a statement of trust in the Ubuntu and Debian developers. When you install Google’s Chrome or MongoDB binaries from their respective archives, that’s a statement of trust in those developers (these have root on your system!). Snappy is not eliminating the need for that trust, as once you give a piece of software access to your personal files, web camera, microphone, etc, you need to believe that it won’t be using those allowances maliciously.\nThe point of Snappy’s confinement in that picture is to enable a software ecosystem that can control exactly what is allowed and to whom in a clear and observable way, in addition to the same procedural care that we’ve all learned to appreciate in the Linux world, not instead of it. Preventing people from using all relevant resources in the system would simply force them to use that same software over less secure mechanisms instead of fixing the problem.\nAnd what we have today is just the beginning. These interfaces will soon become much richer and more fine grained, including resource selection (e.g. which serial port?), and some of them will disappear completely in favor of more secure choices (Unity 8, for instance).\n\n\nA: The problem is not with snaps, but with X11, which is 30 year old technology designed without much security considerations.\nTo \"address the problem\" you simply need to get rid of X11. System without it, such as servers, can benefit from snaps isolation right now. The new Mir that will replace xserver, hopefully sooner rather then later, is supposed to address the security problems of X11.\nYou are more then welcome to read Matthew Garrett's blog post to satisfy your curiousity. It says:\n\nThe problem here is the X11 windowing system. X has no real concept of different levels of application trust. Any application can register to receive keystrokes from any other application. Any application can inject fake key events into the input stream. An application that is otherwise confined by strong security policies can simply type into another window. An application that has no access to any of your private data can wait until your session is idle, open an unconfined terminal and then use curl to send your data to a remote site. As long as Ubuntu desktop still uses X11, the Snap format provides you with very little meaningful security. \n\n", "Q: Downloaded themes don't show up in Unity Tweak I have a fresh 16.04 install, and try to customize it a bit.\nI got a few themes in /usr/share/themes, but they are not listed in Unity Tweak.

Am I doing something wrong, or is it just one more case of the developers telling us \"you think you want it, but you don't\"?\n\nReason\n\nAnyway, kipi-plugins is not maintained by 'the KDE guys' but by 'the digikam guy' and he decided to move these plugins into digikam in the process of porting to KF5/Qt5 and become platform independent (read: MacOS, Windows).\n\nSolution\nThere is not really one except using another tool to do the job.\n\nA: It appears that kipi-plugins are not compiled to Qt5 yet. Hopefully it will soon be. As a workaround one can either use digikam's batch processing or imagemagick (for example 'convert-resize').\n\nA: I switched to Nomacs http://nomacs.org/ that is also a Qt5-based program for batch processing like renaming, resizing, flipping, etc. It's in the repos, it has a PPA. \n", "Q: Xubuntu 16.04 external monitor Ok, my first question here is simple:\nI have xubuntu 16.04 LTS on Laptop X86_64.

The Snap equivalent of sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade, Is the following:\nBy not indicating any package, what it will do is search for all the Snaps that we have installed, it will check if there is a new version and it will install it.\nList updates without installing them\nThe third command I was talking about may be interesting if you only want to install some packages. It would be the following:\nThis can help us, for example, if we are waiting for an update like May water, we see that it is and then we want to install the app we expected and some other, avoiding installing everything if it turns out that there is a lot to install.

Then run following commands.\nsudo apt-get remove plymouth\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nNow, reboot,  \nWhen you reboot, still you may get black or purple screen, \nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login with your username and password. \nThen run following commands.\nGDM ie Gnome display manager was also causing problems for me, so following step was essential for me  \nI switched to lightdm from gdm3  as display manager.\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nWhen you are prompted, select default display manager as lightdm\nNow I was back with desktop , without dash or unity but only icons and wallpaper.\nnow run this.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nNow, reboot after this.\nThe desktop is back!\nnow, you can install intel graphic drivers again,\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nReboot now.\nIts done!\n\nA: For those who messed up with Linux booting after the update (Which happened to many users including me) Here's the complete solution (Which I used, and I was able to get back everything).\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't panic!\n\n*If your computer is hanged at the login screen, press Ctrl+Alt+f2\n\n*It will ask for your login username and password.\n\n*Connect ethernet cable (LAN cable) from your wifi router or modem to your computer\n\n*Type dhclient eth0 and press enter\n\n*For testing networking, try ping www.google.com if there's any failure then please check your LAN connection, router or modem (Connecting to WiFi is a tedious process so try LAN connection first)\n\n*Type reboot and press enter.\n\n*Now keep pressing Esc or Shift key.\n\n*Enter into latest kernel recovery mode.\n\n*Use keyboard arrow keys to navigate.\n\n*Press Enter on Networking\n\n*Now it will display the previous screen.\n\n*Click on root (You need root access to modify system).\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install -f --reinstall lightdm\n\n(It will download 200mb of data)\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-session\n\n\n*Run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n\n*It will ask you to select one out of two options: gdm & lightdm. Select lightdm\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install gnome\n\n( It will download 700mb of data)\n\n*Run reboot and you should be able to get your work back (Although your desktop will look ugly because of conflicting themes. Don't worry, steps 23 & 24 will fix this issue).\n\n*Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n(to purge all unnecessary dependencies which can cause problems while installing new packages)\n\n*Run\nsudo apt install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge light-themes\n\n\n*Run\nsudo apt-get install light-themes\n\n\n*Finally download ubuntu-tweak from ubuntuupdates.com (version that works with Xenial Xerus and isn't available anywhere else!)\n\n*Reboot your system and done!\n\n\nA: I just had the same issue on a fresh Ubuntu 19.04 on a ThinkPad X201. The system would hang forever with a black screen and not react to any keyboard input. At next reboot (into recovery mode) when examining /var/log/boot.log I would see the error told in the question:\nA start job is running for Hold until boot process finishes up (Xmin Xs/no limit)\n\nFunny enough, I was able to start in recovery mode until I see the recovery mode menu and, from there, when choosing \"resume\" I would get to the normal graphical environment. The difference to a normal mode was only that the boot process was done in text mode. This indicates that there is a conflict between the display manager and plymouth, the software responsible for showing the graphical screen with the Ubuntu logo etc. while the computer boots up.\nAnd indeed, the only step required to fix this was removing plymouth, by executing in recovery mode:\nsudo apt remove plymouth\n\nAnd rebooting.\n\nA: Ran into the same problem after installing the Nvidia driver (361).  I removed it and its all working okay now. I have a GeForce 920 (Optimus). Nouveau works fine with it, so I shall stick with it for a few more months and try installing the Nvidia driver again (hoping the bug will have beebln fixed by then).\n\nA: You can skip the wait and go to your log-in screen directly by using 'Ctrl+c' and then work on the solution. Sometimes this will go on forever if not. \n\nA: Another solution is to download the mini.iso version of the installer; it bypasses the problem. Be sure to have a good internet access when you install it, it will download a lot of files.\nDuring the setup, you will be asked which kind of Ubuntu to install.\n", "Q: Minimalist install of Ubuntu (no applications) Is it possible to install Ubuntu (my preferred flavour is Lubuntu) without installing all the default applications? I would only need the window manager and the settings-related programs needed to tweak the OS environment. \nI will manually install by myself any programs I may need.\nIs this possible?\nIf not, is there any quick way to automatically uninstall all the default applications?\nThank you\n\nA: I am trying to construct a (sort of) minimal Ubuntu installation with i3 as my window manager. My current version of this project may be found at:\nAutomate setup for Ubuntu with i3wm: (mstaal/i3buntu)\nEven if the project itself is not of complete interest to you, the method behind constructing the setup may be. What I basically trying to do is to first install what is usually called Ubuntu Minimal (or Ubuntu NetBoot) which is a stripped down version of Ubuntu that comes only with a minimum of packages and software and which is intended for people who want to install typical Ubuntu desktops over the internet or for people who want to make very custom Ubuntu installations. \nWhen Ubuntu Minimal is installed, I use a shell script to install all packages that I believe are necessary to make the Ubuntu setup that I find to be necessary to achieve a nice experience. However, I may still be needing to add and remove certain packages in order to get a proper and well working minimal installation. Personally, I want a setup that includes easy support for drivers, printers, Bluetooth, network and power management and other typical system utilities. It should come loaded with as little bloat as possible, however, it should be as easy as possible to install most typical software (including what I may personally consider bloat). \nThe thing is, that I really quite like the core idea behind the i3 window manager and the ease of Ubuntu combined with Ubuntu's huge package selection and community. I just don't want unnecessary software that takes up space and system resources.\nSo all in all: I do not know if my strategy is of any interest to you. But I have found much fun in making this script which automates my installation setup.\nBy the way: People are highly encouraged to provide feedback for my project if they have any suggestions.\n", "Q: Screen blinking on moving cursor from one monitor to another I have a dual monitor setup at work and when moving the cursor from one monitor to the other the screen blinks and sometimes gets completely black.\nI've recorded a video to better show the problem:\nhttps://vid.me/vgEE\nI just upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 (clean install).

I've already googled for solutions but nothing worked.\nMy computer is a HP probook 4540s.\nThank you\nEDIT: One more piece of information: when I restart instead of shutting down, I can no longer access the internet (via wi-fi). Also, I can get my computer to shutdown without rebooting if a press ( a long time) the (hardware) power button.\n\nA: Try to turn off your wifi from shortcut button for wifi / or from settings and your pc will not start itself.\n\nA: I had this problem once with a HP Probook 840 or something of the sort.  You should try disabling \"Wake on LAN\" or \"Wake on WLAN\" in your BIOS.\n\nA: A workaround I am using is to push the power button while on the grub screen.\nAlso there is a related bug at ubuntu-mate bug tracker.\nEDIT (2017_02_14): Some time ago I've found the same problem reported in a bug report for ubuntu-mate (as this is what I've used).\nAnd just recently\nthe bug seems to be SOLVED after the last kernel upgrade!!!\nI am not very sure about though. Need additional testing.\nBut today with all the rest in the setup unchanged the laptop (HP probook) started to poweroff normally.\nCurrent kernel is:\n$ uname -a\nLinux uhp 4.4.0-62-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 18 14:10:15 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nWhat about the other affected people?\nPS seems to be similar to THIS thread\n\nA: Same issue happens with me.\nThe same sympthom happed with standard 16.04 installation and the current Ubuntu Mate:\ngnagy@hp-pb-4340s:~$ uname -a\nLinux hp-pb-4340s 4.8.0-46-generic #49~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 31 14:51:03 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nIt's important that it did not happen immediately. Couple of weeks passed - roughly a month - then this started to come again and again.\nWhat worked for me as a workaround:\n- disable networking before you turn off the machine\n- reinstall\nJust to confirm that it is still an issue.\n\nA: For me, it helped to add xhci_hcd.quirks=270336 into GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT variable defined in /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub.\nHere are some links to bug reports:\n\n*\n\n*https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1257131\n\n*https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66171\nAnd here is some information about that xhci quirk:\nhttps://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027\n\nThe Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that can be worked around by BIOS. If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake the system. Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.\nThe bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on shutdown. The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.\nUnfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names. One example is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC. Instead, key off the Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports over for all PPT xHCI hosts.\nThe only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple\nhundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the\nports over from EHCI to xHCI.\n\nThe only thing I have to add that I have ASRock Fatal1ty z97 professional motherboard with i5-4690k installed but the quirk still helped me, so I guess it worth a try.\n\nA: Don't know if this is a solution for other people, but if you have a mouse or something on an usb port: change the port.\nI had a similiar problem: fresh install 16.04 ubuntu mate 64, not even one other thing installed and it took my pc nearly two or three minutes to shutdown and after that it immediately rebooted. No problems on Win7. I couldn't find a solution, not with grub updates/changes, bios or whatever. Looked up a lot of boards for answers, nothing worked ...\nChanged the mouse, same effect; changed the usb port: worked. Shutdown now takes seconds and no reboot after.\nI have no idea why - if this is a problem on my side or on linux (I'm absolutely no techie), but I thought, I should tell people, if it can help anyhow ...\n\nA: I had same issue with my custom build desktop. It finally resolved when I shifted the BlueTooth transmitter for my wireless Mouse+Keyboard from onboard USB2.0 port to the USB3.0 PCI expansion card. I had tried modifying grub, it worked till i updated Kernel.\nSeems like some USB related bug.\n\nA: The solution for me was updating the grub (Ubuntu 16.04).\nsudo update-grub\n\nI found this solution here: Fix Shutdown does not power off computer in Ubuntu 14.04\n", "Q: How can I create a 'debian/control' file that differs based on Ubuntu release? I have great deal of source code that we maintain, producing many different Ubuntu packages. All of these packages need to build on Ubuntu LTS releases from Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) forward. (Yes, I know these are old and unsupported. These are for space-bound systems, so updating to a new release is not possible. Yet I still have to maintain the software on them, while updating for new releases.)\nI am trying to get the entire code base up and running on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). I have discovered much to my dismay that the packaging of Python code has changed completely. As of Trusty, python-support and python-central have disappeared and dh_python2 is what you have to use.\nMy problem is how to craft a working debian/control file. The Build-Depends: for versions up to and including Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) needs to include python-central, while for 14.04 and forward it must include dh_python2. I have found no provision for conditional text in the control file. I've tried find a way around this, but so far nothing works.\nHow can this be done?\nI have an extensive buildbot system up and running that compiles on numerous Ubuntu versions, CentOS versions, and some OS X versions. Splitting into branched packages for different versions would break that. So I'm looking for a solution that works on a single source tree. I'm trying to find a hook early on that I could use in dpkg-buildpackage to set things up per-version, but I haven't found a solution yet.\n\nA: The easiest way is to use alternative packages in the Build-Depends field, f.e. Build-Depends: dh-python | python-central, [...].  That has several quirks, the first dependency that satisfy the dependency solver will get picked.  You can also use versioned Build-Depends (f.e. if you know that some earlier versions of packages were incomplete), i.e. Build-Depends: dh-python (>= <correct_version) | python-central.\nThe more complicated way if you need to Depend on package that doesn't exists in earlier (or later release) is to add base-files (<< <version>) | real-package as a dependency instead of just real-package and tune the <version> to match the version in the next release.  If you need a package on older system, but not on new, you would use base-file (>= <version>) | real-package and use <version> from Ubuntu release where you don't need the real-package.\nFor example for backporting apache2 for Ubuntu 12.04 I have changed libnghttp2-dev to base-files (<< 7.2~) | libnghttp2-dev.\nI will add d/rules snippet from my MySQL-5.6 backport:\nDPKG_VENDOR          ?= $(shell dpkg-vendor --query Vendor | tr [A-Z] [a-z])\nDEB_DISTRIBUTION     = $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | sed -ne 's/^Distribution: //p')\n\nENABLE_SYSTEMD = yes\n\nifeq (ubuntu,$(DPKG_VENDOR))\n  ifeq ($(DEB_DISTRIBUTION),$(filter $(DEB_DISTRIBUTION),precise))\n    $(warning Disabling systemd on $(DPKG_VENDOR) $(DEB_DISTRIBUTION))\n    ENABLE_SYSTEMD = no\n  endif\nendif\n\n[...]\n%:\nifeq (yes,$(ENABLE_SYSTEMD))\n        dh $@ --parallel --with systemd\nelse\n        dh $@ --parallel\nendif\n\nand d/control has\nBuild-Depends: [...], dh-systemd (>= 1.5) | base-files (<< 7.2ubuntu5~)\n\n\nA: Here is the script I came up with to allow the code to build on any release.

FINAL EDIT - If you are planning on installing rEFInd you might want to read Rod's answer below.\nAfter installing if you have a bunch of useless entries just write down their name on a piece of paper (rEFInd will describe them as somefile.efi), then open refind.conf and add the line dont_scan_files somefile.efi,someotherfile.efi\nIf you still see useless entries (I had one which said \"fallback boot loader etc\" without specifying any .efi file) just add the line dont_scan_dirs EFI/boot,EFI/Dell,EFI/memtest86. It should do the trick.\n\nI have a machine with an Ubuntu derivative dual booted with Windows 10. I'm currently using GRUB, but planning on switching to rEFInd, mostly for the eye-candy. \nWhat I'm worried about are the possible downsides, especially whether a fancier bootloader like rEFInd might slow down my boot process.\n[EDIT - Ignore the following guide, read the answer below] Lastly, does this guide look reliable?\nEDIT - unlike other pre-existing ones, the focus of this question is on Windows-Linux dual boot (although the answer below seems to cover any OS, with focus on Debian-based ones).\n\nA: I maintain rEFInd, so I understand how it works and interacts with Ubuntu pretty well; but I'm also not without my own biases and preferences. (I forked rEFIt into rEFInd because I dislike GRUB 2 and I thought much of what rEFIt did was elegant, but not quite what I needed.)\nIn most cases, rEFInd works. It's rare to experience post-boot problems with any boot loader; once the kernel boots, it either works completely or not at all. (There are occasional exceptions to this rule, but as I said, they're rare.) Thus, if rEFInd boots your system, you needn't worry too much about follow-on problems. That said, there are advantages and disadvantages to any piece of software, including boot loaders. Compared to GRUB, these points spring to mind concerning rEFInd:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd advantages/GRUB disadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Because it scans for kernels on every boot, rEFInd is more adaptive and is less reliant on configuration files. This is most important if you're booting multiple Linux distributions, since in such a setup, you need to take care that the main GRUB's configuration file knows about changes to the other distribution's kernels.\n\n*GRUB's configuration file format is very complex. It usually works OK because its configuration scripts do the right thing most of the time; but when the scripts get it wrong, fixing it can be a nightmare. Because rEFInd's configuration files are simpler, it tends to be easier to fix and tweak its configuration.\n\n*rEFInd has more eye candy, as you point out.\n\n*rEFInd is more reliable at booting Windows with Secure Boot active. (See this bug report for information on a moderately common problem with GRUB that doesn't affect rEFInd.)\n\n*rEFInd can launch BIOS-mode boot loaders; GRUB can't. For most people, and particularly people with UEFI-based PCs, this isn't a big deal. Some Mac users need BIOS-mode compatibility to dual-boot with Windows 7, though.\n\n*rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R can boot an Ubuntu installation that's become unbootable. There are some caveats and limitations, but even if you don't use rEFInd on your hard disk, having it on a USB flash drive or CD-R can be a useful emergency tool.\n\n*GRUB's configuration scripts can be slow to run. On a complex setup, installing a new kernel can take a minute or more just because these scripts are triggered and they take a ridiculous amount of time to scan the system for kernels and an assortment of boot loaders and to rebuild the configuration file with what's found. Note that you'll experience this problem even if you use rEFInd unless you uninstall GRUB (or don't install it to begin with).\n\n*When working with Secure Boot, rEFInd always enforces Secure Boot policies. GRUB might or might not do so when launching Linux kernels, depending on the GRUB version in use. (Prior to Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu's GRUB would launch even unsigned kernels. I think that 16.04 tightens that a bit, but I haven't yet looked into it in detail.)\n\n\n*rEFInd disadvantages/GRUB advantages\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB is available as an officially-maintained package in Ubuntu, whereas rEFInd is (for now) available as a third-party package and PPA.\n\n*If I get hit by a bus, development of rEFInd is likely to stop; but GRUB has many more developers, and will not become abandonware in the near future.\n\n*GRUB supports more platforms (CPUs and firmware types).\n\n*GRUB is easier to use in a network-boot environment.\n\n*GRUB can (in theory) load a kernel from within an LVM or RAID setup or on an encrypted partition; rEFInd can't do this. (rEFInd can still be used with LVM, RAID, and encrypted setups, but the /boot partition must be separate and unencrypted in such configurations.) Note that I said \"in theory\" because I know of no distribution that takes advantage of this feature, so it is, to the best of my knowledge, poorly tested.\n\n*rEFInd's scans for kernels and boot loaders can take a couple of seconds on each boot, so it may be a bit slower than GRUB to appear. (You can minimize this scanning time by installing only those filesystem drivers you actually need and by keeping the partitions that are scanned uncluttered.)\n\n*Shim was designed to work with GRUB. Although rEFInd also works with Shim, it's not Shim's primary target, so there's the bizarre naming convention of calling rEFInd grubx64.efi to get Shim to launch it; and you'll need to add at least one entry to the MOK list to get rEFInd to work with Shim.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these points, there are occasional system-specific incompatibilities and quirks. Such problems can strike either program, so they aren't really advantages of one or the other.\nIt's possible to set your system up so that rEFInd launches GRUB (or vice-versa), but in most cases you'll end up getting the worst of both programs, not the best, when you do this. On occasion, though, chainloading in this way is desirable -- say, if you want the eye candy of rEFInd and the ability to load a kernel from an LVM, RAID, or encrypted partition.\nAs to the installation instructions to which you link, they're overly complex. The simplest way to install rEFInd in Ubuntu is to use the PPA after you install Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rodsmith/refind\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install refind\n\nThe drawback to this approach is that it's one big leap. If you prefer to test rEFInd before fully installing it, by all means use the USB flash drive, which will let you see how rEFInd works before making any changes to your hard disk.\n", "Q: Internal laptop display is disconnected (LVDS-0 disconnected) I did a clean install of ubuntu gnome 16.04 on my lenovo w520 (without formatting the home partition; before I had ubuntu gnome 15.10).\nMy laptop comes (sadly - since I have always had troubles with it) with an nvidia quadro 2000M (with optimus support) installed on it.

Installation goes well, whether I have a second partition with Mac OS or not, but after successful installation and rebooting, I'm stucked on booting menu. I can see the list of booting devices (type \"l\" for linux, \"c\" for CDROM\"), but whatever I do, the distro doesn't boot up, just keeps rebooting. \nI've already tried mounting sda3, checked the yaboot.conf as well. \nEverything just seems to be ok, so what's the problem?\nWhat should I do, or what do I do wrong?\nPS: I've also tried with Lubuntu 16.04 and got exactly the same problem. \nActually nothing newer than 12.04 LTS wants to boot up...\n\nA: I would try installing off of USB drive.  It works well for me.  First, download the last PPC Ubuntu-MATE here.  Make sure the .iso is on your desktop.\nIn Mac OS X, run:\ndiskutil list\n\nAfter this, find the number of your flash drive, e.g., disk, disk2, disk3, or disk7, you never know so run this and look for the flashdrive's brand next to the BSD identifier.  (If you cannot access, Mac OS X, then insert the OS X CD/DVD with command-C and open a Terminal from within the install OS.)\nThen, still within the Terminal, execute this command to format your flash drive and lose all the information (where disk# = disk3 or disk7 or whatever the above shows you):\nsudo diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Test disk#\n\nsudo dd if=/Users/<usernamenobraces>/Downloads/<nameofisofile> of=/dev/disk# bs=16m && sync\n\nHere is an example with user name tom and disk3\nsudo dd if=/Users/tom/Downloads/ubuntu-mate-16.10-desktop-powerpc.iso of=/dev/disk3 bs=16m && sync\n\nYou might find this fails, so if your disk identifier is 3 like the example, run this command first:\nsudo diskutil unmountDisk disk3\n\nUse -f if you have trouble, then run this command again (make sure to wait until the drive is fully written to): \nsudo dd if=/Users/tom/Downloads/ubuntu-mate-16.10-desktop-powerpc.iso of=/dev/disk3 bs=16m && sync\n\nOnce, this is done, restart the G5 with the flash drive inserted and press commadn-option-f to enter open firmware.  Upon entering Open Firmware, enter the following:\nboot usb0/disk@1:2,\\\\yaboot\n\nIf that does not work, enter the following:  \nboot usb1/disk@1:2,\\\\yaboot\n\n(If neither of those work, try again after taking the USB out and putting back in (no matter what do this once - trust me). Or, adjust the command in open firmware by increasing the usb# to usb3, usb4, etc.  There is one for every USB port and they do not increase by USB port #, but by device number, so there can be a skip.  Usually, it is usb1 or usb2.)\nOnce you get to the yaboot prompt, enter install or simply press enter at the Yaboot bootloader screen that follows.  If you have an old graphics card the enter videoof=only or cli or cli-expert and then press enter. Whether you chose graphical or text, follow the steps for a normal / default install after tat (which can be found elsewhere).

Afterwards I would like it to rearrange/add/remove the icons to the unity launcher.\nUsing dconf watch / I can see output as I reorder the icons. Is there a command line way to do this - possibly with gsettings? \n\nA: Introduction\nThe simple script bellow allows taking a file as argument and sets the launcher to have whatever shortcuts to programs appear in the file (one per line).\nBasic idea is that the launcher icons are actually links to .desktop files (wherever they may appear) , and canonical method to set the launcher items is to run the following command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites  \"[ 'item1.desktop' , 'item2.desktop' , . . . 'item3.desktop;  ]\"\n\nThis can get tedious if you want to add many items and quoting can become a pain. One can always open a desired program and right click on the icon to invoke the \"Lock to launcher\" option, but that also is not practical when you're dealing with large amount of items. \nThe approach taken here is to simply read a file, with 1 time per line, build up the command text , and execute it. This is no different from running the gsettings set command above, except that the hard work is done for you.\nUsage:\nTo run the script , save it to a file, make it executable with chmod +x /path/to/script and run as\npython /path/to/script /path/to/file\n\nThe input file should contain full path to the items you want added to the launcher, such as /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop , but it's not necessary , a line with firefox.desktop is OK too.\nDemo\nBefore running the script\n\nAfter running the script\n\nNote that the order is exactly the same as the entries appear in the input file\nScript Source\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Date: April 22, 2016\n# Purpose:  programmatically set Unity launcher items\n# by reading a file\n# Written for: http://askubuntu.com/q/760895/295286\n# Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\ncommand=\"\"\"gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"\"\"\n\ndef run_command(cmd):\n    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    output = p.stdout.read().strip()\n    return output  \n\n\nitems=\"\"\nwith open(sys.argv[1]) as file:\n  for line in file:\n      temp = \"'\" + line.strip().split('/')[-1] + \"'\"\n      items = \",\".join([items,temp])\n\nitems = '\"[ ' + items[1:] + ' ]\"'\n\nprint run_command(command + \" \" + items)\n\n", "Q: Can't install pipelight ubuntu 16.04 sudo apt-get install pipelight\nReading package lists...

Option one is wait for pipelight to be officially compiled and released then install as shown here. Option two is compile it yourself as is shown here. Option three is to install from the .deb files for Ubuntu 15.10 which can be found here. For option three you will need to install pipelight-multi - 0.2.8.2~ubuntu15.10.1 deb file and be sure you pick the 32bit or 64bit file depending on your computer hardware. Here is how you can check.

This is nice because it means you don't have to build wine which is huge and you can just build pipelight.\n\nA: It's because pipelight hasn't been specifically compiled for 16.04.  Apt-get looks for the version that is compiled for your version of the OS.  Just install the 15.10 version.

With a working internet connection by ethernet, tethered or whatever means possible, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.git\ncd ath10k-firmware/QCA6174/hw2.1/\nsudo cp *  /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/\ncd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/\nsudo mv firmware-5.bin_SW_RM.1.1.1-00157-QCARMSWPZ-1  firmware-5.bin\n\nReboot and let us see again:\ndmesg | grep ath\n\n", "Q: Create a script to move files that ignore errors I can move files in the terminal easily enough. I have a whole mess of stuff submitted by students daily and it'd make my life a lot easier to have one thing I can run of an evening that'll move all the photo submissions (JPGs and PNGs normally) to one directory, and all the text stuff to another. \nI could write something basic with mv *.jpg kind of commands but if there aren't any of those types of file there then I'm assuming the entire script would fail and the whole time-saving exercise would be pointless. \nTo add a complication, a couple of my higher students submit in zip's so I'd like to be able to make the script extract them out first. \nSo, TL;DR - extract zips & move files without being stopped for errors caused by there not being a particular type of file.\n\nA: \nI'm assuming the entire script would fail\n\nIt won't, only that single command would \"fail\" (meaning the *.jpg globbing pattern will be expanded to a literal *.jpg, which will make the command throw an error in case a file named *.jpg doesn't exist), but the script will keep executing despite the error. So in most cases that's not a concern, however if you want to do things The Right Way™, enable failglob before running the commands containing the globbing patterns:\nshopt -s failglob\n\nFrom Bash Reference Manual: Filename Expansion:\n\nIf the failglob shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed.\n\nTo extract all the .zip files in the current working directory to a single directory:\nunzip '*.zip' -d /path/to/target/directory\n\nNotice that *.zip is enclosed in single quotes, so that unzip can expand the pattern on its own (the command would fail otherwise).\nPutting everything toghether:\n#/bin/bash\nshopt -s failglob\nmv *.jpg /path/to/target/directory\nmv *.png /path/to/target/directory\nunzip '*.zip' -d /path/to/target/directory\n\n\nA: It is sufficient to have 3 commands that use find SOURCE_FOLDER -type f -exec COMMAND {} \\; structure. Bellow is a script that combines all 3. Each command will exit silently if no files found - simple as that; that means if you have png files but not jpeg files , you still will move png where they need to be without errors.\nHere's a small demo , where you can see I have 2 image files and 1 zip file.

I am trying to install drivers for that printer on Ubuntu and when I go to the HP Linux site, I see lots of printers but not that one.  Has anyone managed to install drivers that will work for that printer on Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Just bought a HP envy 4520 and it works out of the box with CUPS. No driver installation was needed.\nI just connected it to my wifi and added the printer using auto discover. Scanning is also working without any further configuration or installation.\n\nA: I just had to configure Ubuntu 19.10 with HP envy 4520. I had no issues with 18.04, 18.10, and 19.04, as it used to auto-discover both the printer and the scanner over Wi-Fi with no human intervention. However, in 19.10 I had to do it manually.\nTo add the printer, in Applications, go to Printers and click Add. This should automatically find the printer and add it to the list. You can double check by printing a document. Adding a scanner is a little trickier.\nTo add the scanner, based on HpAllInOne, I had to run sudo hp-setup. If you get error: hp-setup requires GUI support, you need to run sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5. Retry sudo hp-setup, and it should open a GUI window1. From there, it wouldn't auto-detect the scanner over Wi-Fi, as it couldn't find any scanners. So, click Back and on the start page, click Advanced. Enter your printer's IP2 and confirm. Now if you go back to Printers utility, you should see your scanner there.\n\n1If that didn't work, refer to the link above. You may need to install python3-pyqt4.\n2You can find the IP in at least two ways: (1) if your printer is already detected, go to Printers, click the gear icon, then Printer Details, and you'll see the Address there; (2) in your printer's interface, go to network settings and look for the IP address. It goes without saying, but you should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network!\n\nA: After the latest update to ubuntu 20.04 dated 22/5-2020 the hp envy 4520 funktion as it should.\nPrevious when i added the printer to my system it added the printer twice and i got a comunication with the printer problem.\nIt looks like the problem now is solved from the updated kernel.\n\nA: I finally got mine working by getting the IPv4 from the printer's network settings and adding a printer manually with the URI socket://<printer.ip.here>.\n", "Q: xrdp on ubuntu server I have set up xrdp on my ubuntu server 15.10, with mate desktop environment and it all works fine and dandy.

So what am I doing wrong?  Is there anyway I can use xrdp as soon as my system boots without having to disable my firewall?\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 14.10, the xrdp package provided by Ubuntu (Ubuntu repositories) allow you to reconnect to the same session.  \nfirewall wise, you should only need the port 3389 as the xrdp software is acting as a proxy.  When you connect to port 3389, in your xrdp.ini file, you can see that additional connection is done through the ip 127.0.0.1 (itself)\nWe have tested the following \n\n\n*\n\n*Install xrdp (from ubuntu repository)  (sudo apt-get install xrdp) \n\n*Install mate-desktop as alternate desktop \n\n*enable your firewall  \n\n*for xrdp, allow incoming traffic for 3389 \n\n\nat this stage, we are able to perform a remote desktop connection to ubuntu. we can disconnect and reconnect to the same session while the firewall is enabled \nWe can reboot the server and connect via xrdp while firewall is enabled... \nSo our recommendation, try to install xrdp as default and you should be good to go \nHope this help\n", "Q: Ricoh SP 211SU Driver I want my Ricoh SP 211SU printer to work, but there is no driver.

I could overcome this by changing the rotation on atleast one screen, applying the settings, then putting them back again. The top tool bar would then correctly be set to my primary (Left) screen.\nThe process below now does this for me automatically (many thanks to etron's post) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install arandr to easily find and configure your display names.  \nsudo apt-get install arandr --upgrade\n\n\n*Run the arandr command from a shell to configure and identify your displays.\n-- For Layout you can drag the monitors around.\n-- For Active, Primary, Resolution and Orientation settings goto menu option Outputs > %Display.\n\n*Once the above is set as you'd like, goto menu option Layout > Save as: \nand enter ~/.screenlayout/ScreenLayout.sh in the name field.\n\n*Edit the ~/.screenlayout/ScreenLayout.sh file in a text editor and duplicate (copy & paste) the entire xrandr line.\n\n*Now modify a value in the first xrandr line.\nI changed the --rotate normal option value to --rotate left. When this script runs it will briefly change the rotation left, then back to normal, re-activating the config.

You can find it by going to the dash and typing \"Startup Applications\" and Ubuntu will find it for you, or you can run this command in a shell:\ngnome-session-properties\n\n\n*Now, from within the session and Startup tool, navigate to the \"Applcation Autostart\" tabe, click the \"Add\" button and add a new program to run upon logging in. A window will pop up asking you what to run, here is what to type:\nName: Set Default Monitor (Note: put any name you want)\nDescription: Leave blank or put a reminder for yourself later what this does.\nCommand: ~/.screenlayout/ScreenLayout.sh \n\n*Reboot to fully test it worked.  \nNote: If you aren't sure if the command will work and want to test it first, you can run the script manually i.e. in my case I would run this\n~/.screenlayout/ScreenLayout.sh in a shell. Also, if you would prefer to use keybindings to set multiple configuration, I believe you can do this within arandr, though it requires Metacity, which I haven't investigated so you're on your own here.\n\nA: I had this same problem, as well as several other problems related to having multiple monitors. \nIt turns out this is an open unsolved bug for Ubuntu; meaning the solution link posted in the above comment does not actually contain a solution that fully works.  See open bug report here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1425000\nFortunately I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to configure this as well as the orientation of the login screens but that's explained in a different thread (I have four monitors and login orientation was wrong but it's all sorted now, if you also have this issue see solution here: Where does Unity/Unity-Greeter Load X Configuration From?)\nThe quick simple solution to the problem of not being able to set your default display, and/or the default display getting reset after reboot is to put a short shell command that changes the primary monitor as one of your \"Startup Applications\" which will automatically run every time you log in (this should work for any recent Ubuntu running the Unity display manager which is the default display manager and probably other DMs but I didn't test that):\n1) First, you will want to install arandr to easily find your monitor display names, run this in a shell:\nsudo apt-get install arandr --upgrade\n\n2) Next, run the arandr command and look at it's user interface that loads (it will probably load on the wrong screen since you haven't configured anything yet).  \n3) Now, take note of which display (the names should be something like HDMI-# for hdmi or DP-# for display port, DVI-I-# for digital video, etc).  The label should be big and obvious once you run arandr. You can either write down the display name, or just keep arnadr window open, so you can see it, and launch a new shell if you need to for the next part.  My default display is called DP-4 used in the next example, but undoubtedly yours will be different so take note for the next step.\n4) Next, load up the \"Startup Applications\" tool.  You can find it by going to the dash and typing \"Startup Applications\" and Ubuntu will find it for you, or you can run this command in a shell:\ngnome-session-properties\n\n5) Now, from within the Startup Applications tool, click the \"Add\" button and add a new program to run upon logging in.  A window will pop up asking you what to run, here is what to type:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: Set Default Monitor \n\n*(Note: put any name you want) \n\n*Command: xrandr --output DP-4 --primary\n\n*(Note: change DP-4 *to whatever monitor code you found you want to be the default display when you ran *arandr)\n\n*Comment: Leave blank or put a reminder for yourself later what this does.\nReboot to fully test it worked and that should do the trick.  If you aren't sure if the command will work and want to test it first, you can run xrandr --output DP-4 --primary (again, replace DP-4 with your default monitor) from a shell then launch a window and see if it shows up on the correct default monitor.  But in order to have this save and work each time, to work around the bug, you need to add that command to Startup Applications.   \nUPDATE:  It seems here is a second step / part 2 to this solution in order for it to fully work.  After several days of testing on Ubuntu 16.04, I discovered it was also necessary to modify ~/.config/monitors.xml to specify the primary monitor.  If you don't set the primary monitor in ~/.config/monitors.xml then it appears some windows and/or programs obey the xrandr command and some do not.   All you need to do in order to perform this step is open up  ~/.config/monitors.xml in a text editor like gedit and set the <primary> tag to yes for the display monitor you want as primary and no for all other displays. \nHere are the steps:\n1) In a shell, first backup your existing monitors.xml file so you can restore it if something unexpected goes wrong during the editing process:\ncp ~/.config/monitors.xml ~/.config/monitors_OLD.xml\n\n2) Open monitors.xml in gedit to change the config settings tags:\ngedit ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\n3) Now, inside of the gedit editor window, find the output tag labeled for the monitor you want to be primary, then under that <output> block, change the <primary> tag to yes.  Be sure to look at all other monitors and change the primary tag for all the other monitors to no.\nFor me, doing these two things has solved the problem in all cases I've encountered so far.\n\nA: In addition to etron's answer - that didn't work for me, my secondary screen (HDMI1) which is on the left, still would act as if it was to the right of the primary (HDMI2) after a reboot, even though it was all correct in my monitors.xml. What worked for me was as etron describes, but I put the following command in my startup applications instead:\nxrandr --output HDMI2 --pos 1920x0 --output HDMI1 --pos 0x0\n\nThis forces my primary (HDMI2) on the right (horizontal offset x=1920) and the secondary (HDMI1) on the left (x=0)\n\nA: You can also try switching off and on the currently main monitor in the display configuration, as indicated here: Is there any ability to set my primary monitor?\n", "Q: New 16.04 install, screen goes blank at random I've installed Ubuntu 16.04 alongside no other OS.

But to no avail, because iwconfig shows me \"no wireless extensions\" and \"modprobe\"ing shows \"error: required key missing\". I think in the latest kernel ubuntu is looking for signed drivers?

If that's not the case, then what should be the direction that I should start looking into?\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\nA: So, I figured out what the problem was. Since my machine runs on a UEFI BIOS with secured boot enabled, all the drivers that can be loaded onto the driver stack must be \"signed\".

I have some PDF files that I want to split apart into TIFF files using convert (in order to OCR via tesseract). This so far is working great - except that in order to automate the whole process, I need to set the DPI of the convert output. Right now, I am using a command like this:\nconvert -density 300 myFile.pdf -depth 8 -background white output-%04d.tiff\n... which outputs the PDF files at 300 DPI. However, some PDF files have lower DPI (e.g. 150 DPI) which means that I don't want to output them at 300 DPI via convert - this creates excessively large TIFF files without any additional information.\nI know that there are ways to check the DPI of images in a PDF file by opening Adobe Acrobat and messing around in the \"preflight\" tools. However, is there a way to determine via the command line the DPI of a particular PDF file?\n\nA: This technique also uses ImageMagick:\nidentify -format \"%w x %h %x x %y\" DAT_1.tif\n\nThe output is the size of the image and the dpi:\n2480 x 3507 300 x 300\n\n\nA: I use the following command:\nconvert MyPDF.pdf -print \"Size: %wx%h\\n\" /dev/null\n\nand it returns:\nSize: 380x380\n\n\nA: Main answer\nSince I am interested in the same kind of job (though not necessarily to OCR the PDF files, but to convert them to DjVu and then OCR them), I found this question and the responses lacking (since I needed to guess the DPI of the images with the number of pixels and then use the size as output by pdfinfo or other tricks---not to mention that the images inside a PDF may have different densities etc.).\nAfter a lot of research more, I found that you can use pdfimages (from package poppler-utils) like the following:\n$ pdfimages -list deptest.pdf\npage   num  type   width height color comp bpc  enc interp  object ID x-ppi y-ppi size ratio\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   1     0 image     100   100  gray    1   1  image  no         9  0    53    53  169B  14%\n   2     1 image     100   100  gray    1   1  ccitt  no   [inline]      53    53  698B  56%\n\nNotice the x-ppi and y-ppi at the listing above. It also lists the format in which the images are stored in the PDF, which is cool (sometimes, it is JBIG2, sometimes JPEG2000 etc.)\nNote: The file deptest.pdf used above is available from pdfsizeopt's repository.\nThe real action\nAfter that, you can simply extract the images with pdfimages itself or use pdftoppm (also from poppler-utils) to render entire pages in many formats that you may like (e.g., tiff, for scanning with tesseract).\nYou can use something like the following (assuming you have created a directory named imgs where you will put your images):\npdfimages -png Faraway-PRA.pdf imgs/prefix\n\nThe files will be created inside the directory imgs with names starting with prefix, as in:\n$ ls \nprefix-000.png  prefix-047.png  prefix-094.png  prefix-141.png\nprefix-001.png  prefix-048.png  prefix-095.png  prefix-142.png\nprefix-002.png  prefix-049.png  prefix-096.png  prefix-143.png\nprefix-003.png  prefix-050.png  prefix-097.png  prefix-144.png\n(...)\n\nYou can, then, perform any surgery that you see fit with tools like scantailor or whatever you like.\nMore direct answer\nIf you just want to OCR a PDF file, you can use a program that is well-maintained and already packaged, namely ocrmypdf.\n", "Q: How to recover from a Nvidia fail on Ubuntu 16.04?

My configuration is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*computer is a Dell M3800 (a beefy laptop); its internal display is 15 inch, 1920x1080 resolution;\n\n*there is also an external display, which is a 24 inch display, same resolution, connected via HDMI.\n\n\nThere is something really strange since the upgrade, and I'm not sure why that is...\nThe configuration of the displays is so that the laptop is on the left (which it is, physically) and the large screen on the right. I have windows on both screens.\nWhen I leave the computer alone and screens enter \"power saving\", if I wake the screens up, all windows are \"back\" to the laptop screen...\n\nSince the initial question, I have noticed that in fact this has nothing to do with my locking the screen at all; it is systematic as long as the screens enter power saving mode (note: the screens, not the computer).\nFor this I have tried another configuration: only activate the Asus monitor via HDMI and deactivate the laptop's internal display... On wake up, the laptop screen highlights briefly before X \"remembers\" that \"uh no, the guy wants the external display only\" and switches back to the wanted configuration again.\nAlso, this laptop has an nVidia chipset, and it doesn't matter whether I use the nouveau driver or nVidia proprietary driver: the effects are the same.\nI have opened a bug (link), but in the meanwhile, is there a workaround for this apart from, in settings, never let the screens \"fall asleep\", which is a waste?\n\nA: I have the same laptop but with a 4k screen and i don't have this issue although my external screen is connected via displayport/thunderbolt.\nI found that the HDMI socket was not as reliable for external screens and would struggle with my 4k external screen, that said your resolutions shouldn't be a problem.\nThere might be some issues with HDMI-CEC which can be used to control screens via HDMI - http://hdmicec.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/how-to-find-out-if-your-device-is-hdmi.html\nI found it was much more reliable on my setup if i used the graphics drivers ppa https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nI use nvidia-367 and it seems to be much faster at initialising screens, previous versions often timed out getting 4k sync so would take ages to start and give me errors.\n\nA: I see this problem with Dell Precision 5510. 1 monitor is hdmi, other is VGA plugged into a thonderbolt adapter. Nvidia 1000m and intel graphics.\nThe Intel graphic display is nicer, nvidia has lots of tearing. However Intel has horrible resume from screen lock problem described here. Awake from suspend is ok if machine is not unplugged and used elsewhere. The hdmi monitor almost always stays black after wake from screenlock and will not wake up without logging out.  \nIf using nvidia driver then there is a 50% chance monitor will wake up if I try with arandr. \nIf you did not try arandr yet, you should. It is nice gui view of xrandr and you can turn monitors off and on. It can save configs.\nWhen arandr does not 'wake up' the monitor, fix requires log out, after which it is fine, until I go to bathroom and screen lock kicks in. Have considered getting bucket to avoid trip away from desk :)\nWhen one monitor goes black, the desktop / window manager does not squeeze everything onto the surviving monitor. Some apps are on the dark side, but xfce4 workspace switcher shows both in panel. \nI have no luck with optimus/bumblebee. nvidia-settings has nice chooser to switch display driver, requires log out to change over.\nI will go find more, different types of monitors. Am suspecting aged monitors are part of explanation. These are 24\" Dell monitors that must be 4 or 5 year old. To others with trouble, do you have same?\nPlease think on this. If I reboot, both displays are found instantly and all is well. Doesn't that mean the video driver itself is ok? In ubuntu 16.04, I did have the \"my cursor is invisible after suspend\" problem, but only in the Intel display case (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1573454, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/1568604). Nvidia did not show same. Then we got word the light-locker should be removed to fix. Xscreensaver to the rescue.  Maybe display driver had defect, but locker contributed. We were blaming display driver entirely.\nHmm. Makes me wonder if Xscreensaver may link to black screen trouble. Will test. If you have the black screen trouble, have you made other desktop/locker changes?\n", "Q: Lenovo B560 with Ubuntu 16.04 can't discover my wifi I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop Lenovo B560 but can't discover my wifi, other devices can discover wifi, this laptop(16.04) can discover other wifi in neighborhood.

After completing the install, the system fails to boot and prints a single line fsck output, with the rest of the screen entirely blank.\n\nThis very same server installs Ubuntu Server 14.04.4 LTS just fine, so this is very specific to 16.04 LTS. I've tried installing every which way I can think of in 16 and I get the same results every time: installation completes with no errors, but upon reboot I get a black screen with that one line of fsck output after rebooting :(\nI noticed that one big difference between 14 and 16 installs on this server machine (which is unexceptional, it's just a generic Broadwell i5 box with 16GB RAM and Samsung 850 EVO SSD) is that Ubuntu 14 detects and installs the drive as /sda whereas Ubuntu 16 detects and installs the drive as /sdc -- furthermore, Ubuntu 16 detects the USB flash drive with the Ubuntu install as /sda! This strikes me as .. very incorrect.\n\nHow can I get the Ubuntu Server 16.04 install to stop treating the USB installation drive as /sda?\nEdit: per request, here's the output of fdisk after pressing alt+→ near the end of the install\n\nhere's the output of \n# mkdir /mnt/ssd\n# mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/ssd\n# nano /mnt/ssd/etc/fstab\n\n\nWhen I boot into \"rescue mode\" from the USB install media (no option to boot in recovery mode is presented to me), I get the following options for \"device to use as a root file system\"\n/dev/sda1  \n/dev/sda5  \n/dev/sdb1  \nAssemble RAID array  \nDo not use a root file system  \n\nNotice that no /sdc filesystem is detected or shown.

I tried it again with /sda as the target, and that seemed to work.\nBut rebooting, same black screen, single like fsck output unfortunately.\n\nA: I had the same problem last night with Ubuntu 15.10. Turned out I knocked out a SATA connector on a (secondary) drive. No actual error is output here, which was quite confusing until I opened up and noticed the connector out of place.\nLeads me to think that for you it’s looking for the flash drive using some sort of identifier that in some way has changed between the live USB boot and the boot of the installed system, or you just haven’t tried booting with the drive attached.\nBoot a live OS (you should be able to get away with reusing your Ubuntu Server flash drive – hit Alt→ to get to a command line). Get a list of disks and partitions:\n# fdisk -l | less\n\nObviously it’ll be on sdc, but determine which partition is the ext4 system one.\nMount the partition (assuming sdc2):\n# mkdir /mnt/ssd\n# mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt/ssd\n\nNow inspect its fstab:\n# nano /mnt/ssd/etc/fstab\n\nIf this is a UEFI install, you should probably only have lines for the EFI system partition (/boot/efi), the boot partition (/boot), and the system root (/). The setup helpfully annotates the lines it made in the generated fstab, so anything not on /dev/sdc* should be removed (or just comment it out to be safe).\nSave that (CtrlX, Y, Enter), and do\n# sync\n# reboot\n\nto ensure changes are committed to disk and reboot. Disconnect the flash drive and see how it goes.\nA few common reasons I’ve seen flash drives appear before the system drive are due to a BIOS setting being used that allows you to fake the drive to another type (floppy drive, hard drive, etc) rather than relying on the drive’s own identification, or because the drive has had the removable bit turned off. Are you using the same drive for the 14.04 installer as you are for 16.04? If you’re certain it’s not on your end then it does sound like an OS bug.\n\nA: You are mislead by the sda/sdc issue. Your fstab shows that the machine assigns file systems per UUID, and on top of that, the fsck line shows that grub could start the initrd which did the initial filecheck.\nIt could be something as simple as wrong graphics setting for the kernel. Basically, you can't see the ttys, and X is not on your server, correct?\nTry and add nomodeset to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" line in /etc/default/grub, and also add a line GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep.\nI had two systems with 16.04 showing similar symptoms as you describe, but since they could boot to X, I could fix it in a running system. It was very similar, I saw the fsck line (on tty1) or nothing at all (on tty2-6).\n\nA: I noticed the same behavior with 16.04 net install.\nIf your issue is the same as mine, it actually booted fine it's just showing you tty7.\nTry hitting ctrl+alt+F1 that should take you to the terminal with a login prompt.\n\nA: I just installed Ubuntu Server 16.04.1 LTS and encountered the exact same problem.\nThis issue is caused by the grub option GRUB_CMLDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT being set to \"quiet splash\", just like in the Desktop version of Ubuntu. The splash screen is shown instead of the usual verbose boot text.\nSomehow after the boot process is done, the console gets dropped to tty7, which is the non-existent xserver GUI, which results in the abovementioned issue.\nSet it back to \"text\" and after all that verbose boot messages Ubuntu Server will boot into tty1 console.\nEdit: As mentioned by @emk2203, this issue is not caused by the bootloader being installed to the wrong drive. The installation actually succeeds to boot, but due to the bug in the grub config the nonexistent tty7 is sent to the main display instead of tty1.\n\nA: This looks like a similar problem I had with a previous Ubuntu. It was installing the boot loader to the Usb drive. I had to manually install a boot loader (grub or whatever) to the internal ssd. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 no menu bar or launcher - help! Just upgraded to 16.04. Due the screen flicker I followed the guide posted by Zacharee 1! The screen doesn't flicker anymore. However although I can login there is no menu bar of launcher. I've tried various guides to restore it in previous Ubuntu's like rm -rf .compiz-1, rm -rf ~/.config and sudo apt-get install unity. Nothing works and I can't find something specific for 16.04. I'm on a Skylake system with Nvidia GTX 950.\n\nA: Had same issue after fooling around with unity-tweak-tool. The following terminal commands helped for me (tnx to ubuntuhandbook.org):\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nsetsid unity\n\n\nA: typing ccsm and selecting unity launcher did it.\nFrom a tty, run the following commands:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nccsm\n\nThen, you may need to press CTRL+ALT+f7 to get back to the x session.\n\nA: rm -rf ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/*\n\nis the best trick. Reboot after this.\n\nA: Short answer: If none of the standard posted solutions (using dconf, gconftool-2, ccsm, unity, etc.) work, try temporarily disabling the autostart apps. Here's one way to do that:\nmv ~/.config/autostart ~/.config/autostartBAK \n\nLog out then log back in again. If the problem is resolved, it is a good bet one of the autostart programs was crashing. You can then figure out which one, then move everything but that one back to ~/.config/autostart.\nLong answer: In my case, the 16.04 upgrade went fine, but out of the blue several weeks later this \"no menu bar or launcher\" problem appeared. None of the usual posted solutions worked. But logging in to a newly created user account did not exhibit the problem, so I knew the problem was strictly in my home directory. Checking ~/.xsession-errors, I noticed that one app was crashing on startup (my-weather-indicator).

[AMD/ATI] Redwood XT [Radeon HD 5670/5690/5730]\n07:00.1 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

[AMD/ATI] Redwood HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 5000 Series]\n\nHow can I reduce the fan speed to reduce the noise?\n\nA: You need to establish which fans are making the noise by running the PC with the sides off and listening to each fan. Is it the CPU fan, the GPU fans (I see you have two graphics cards), or the case fan(s)? You can test if a fan is the one making the noise by gently touching its centre with a finger to  stop it.\nYou also need to establish whether the increase in noise is accompanied by a rise in temperature and where.\nTo do this install lm-sensors and configure it. Then install psensors and study the fan speeds and temperatures. Instructions are here lm-sensor and fanspeed instructions\nOnce you have established which fans are running faster and making noise you need to determine whether they are running faster because the relevant system component is heavily loaded. Then the solution will be to reduce the load on the component by adjusting the power management settings or finding a bug.\nIf the fans are running faster than you like and the relevant system component is not getting too hot you can slow the fans. There are two routes to doing this. If the relevant fan can be controlled by your BIOS I recommend doing this. If not then install and configure fanspeed.\n\nA: This is a problem related to drivers. I can tell you because I have an ATI HD5750 and I always had issues regarding fan noise using Open Source AMD Drivers. Easiest solution was just to use the ATI Catalyst drivers but that is not an option now.\nSince Ubuntu 16.04 AMD is dropping support of proprietary drivers for future releases. Good news is that they are focusing on Open Source drivers, so for now this is a transitioning period.\nSolution for now is just stick to Ubuntu 15.10 or find a way to control power profile for Open Source Drivers but I honestly never found an easy solution for this.\n", "Q: Snap-stores with proprietary snap packages Ubuntu doesn't offer paid-for software in the Software Center in 16.04.\nWill the Snap Store become the way to distribute proprietary paid for software on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Snap packages are perfect for projects with complex dependencies or longer development cycles that don't sync with distros easily. This often intersects with the needs of proprietary software but it won't be suitable for all of them. At the moment the only snap packages i've seen are for very open source projects but i suspect the proprietary will come soon enough once there teams have got the hang of it.  On modern systems with lots of storage its not so bad to use non shared libraries, especially it it makes installation simpler.\nThere are two packages in the 16.04 ubuntu repository that are referred to here that are nothing to do with ubuntu snap.\nsnap - SNAP is a general purpose gene finding program \nsnappy - snappy is a media player \nif you want to use ubuntu snaps install \nsnapcraft - tools for making snaps\nsnapd - tools for using snaps \nAt the time of writing you will need to purge the snap package before installing snapd otherwise it will conflict, this might get fixed but for now it will prevent the install of the snapd package.\nSnaps are really easy to use but there aren't that many available yet\nsnap login your@ubuntu.one.email       # login to the snap system\nsnap list                              # list available snap packages\nsnap install <package>                 # install a snap package\n\n\nA: Yes. Packages in the snap format are not part of the standard archive, and come from the Ubuntu app store for devices (both click and snap packages are hosted in the same store). This store is not curated by the community, and anyone may package their software in the snap format and distribute it via the store.\nThere are already several proprietary packages in the store.\n\nA: I expect creating custom app is absolutely possible. Even more, creating a store utilizing the custom repositories and snaps stored outside the Ubuntu servers seems absolutely possible to me.\nIf I am not wrong, the dpkg operates just on .deb files, without possibility to manage the repositories, PPA-s etc. That's what apt is for. What if someone created the tool which would something like apt for the snap command?\nOpen store\nThe snap command allows you to install any .snap file - not only those downloaded from the official store. Let's imagine an open app store, which handles packages in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*The program configuration stores the list of websites, which provide the snap packages and their metadata. Let's call them just Snap PPA's, because they would serve exactly the same purpose.\n\n*The program allows to add/remove the repositories with commands such as add-repository URL.\n\n*On install command the program checks if the requested snap is available on any of the PPA's, then download it to the cache and call 'sudo snap install the-package.snap'.\n\n*The program checks for updates automatically, downloads and updates the snaps.\nThe only thing that might not be doable so far are delta updates (I have never tried to find out how they are handled in the official tool), but this issue might be addressed in future if needed.\nCommercial stores\nIf a company would not like to handle their snaps to Canonical and rely on their infrastructure, they can create their own repository in the same way. I imagine that Steam could take this approch someday - just have the proprietary snap package downloader built in the Linux Steam client.

Now, for some reason, pam_mount stopped working and no directories are mounted. So, I enabled pam_mount debugging and see the following:\n(rdconf1.c:744): path to luserconf set to\n/home/DOMAIN/username/Documents/.pam_mount.conf.xml\n(pam_mount.c:365): pam_mount 2.14: entering auth stage\n(rdconf1.c:744): path to luserconf set to\n/home/DOMAIN/username/Documents/.pam_mount.conf.xml\n(pam_mount.c:568): pam_mount 2.14: entering session stage\n(pam_mount.c:629): no volumes to mount\ncommand: 'pmvarrun' '-u' 'username' '-o' '1'\n(pmvarrun.c:258): parsed count value 0\n(pam_mount.c:441): pmvarrun says login count is 1\n(pam_mount.c:660): done opening session (ret=0)\n\nSo, no volumes to mount? My pam_mount.conf.xml looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<!DOCTYPE pam_mount SYSTEM \"pam_mount.conf.xml.dtd\">\n<pam_mount>\n\n<debug enable=\"1\" />\n<luserconf name=\"Documents/.pam_mount.conf.xml\" />\n<volume user=\"*\" sgrp=\"residents\" fstype=\"cifs\" server=\"dfs.namespace.com\" path=\"data/users/%(USER)/documents\" mountpoint=\"~/Documents\" options=\"uid=%(USER),gid=100,dir_mode=0700\" />\n<volume user=\"*\" sgrp=\"residents\" fstype=\"cifs\" server=\"dfs.namespace.com\" path=\"data/public\" mountpoint=\"~/mount/Public\" options=\"uid=%(USER),gid=100,dir_mode=0700\" />\n\n<mntoptions allow=\"nosuid,nodev,loop,encryption,fsck,nonempty,allow_root,allow_other,uid,gid,dir_mode\" />\n<mntoptions require=\"nosuid,nodev,uid,gid,dir_mode\" />\n<logout wait=\"0\" hup=\"0\" term=\"0\" kill=\"0\" />\n<mkmountpoint enable=\"1\" remove=\"true\" />\n\n</pam_mount>\n\nand this configuration has worked for months, until now. I don't recall making any configuration changes lately. I suspect that an upgrade ruined it because one day I noticed this had happened on all of my workstations. And I have no idea where to look next :( Google hasn't been really helpful.\nIn /var/log/syslog it says:\nApr 23 11:25:54 hostname nslcd[1261]: [86d4c7] <authz=\"username\"> ldap_result() failed: Operations error: 000004DC: LdapErr: DSID-0C0906E8, comment: In order to perform this operation a successful bind must be completed on the connection., data 0, v1db1\n\nbut honestly I've been seeing these errors in syslog since always, and as the LDAP authentication has worked fine (and still does) I haven't paid much attention to it. Logging on seems to work fine in /var/log/auth.log:\nApr 23 11:43:48 hostname su[10409]: pam_winbind(su:auth): getting password (0x00000388)\nApr 23 11:43:48 hostname su[10409]: pam_winbind(su:auth): pam_get_item returned a password\nApr 23 11:43:49 hostname su[10409]: pam_winbind(su:auth): user 'username' granted access\n\nOther than that, I don't see anything relevant in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/auth.log. I have Ubuntu 14.04. I'm quite new to Linux and I'd appreciate if someone had some ideas what I'd try next :)\n\nA: I had this same issue after some updates today. I've done some testing and found that removing the sgrp=\"...\" parameter to the volume allows them to mount. It looks like it thinks there are no volumes to mount because the user wasn't in the listed group.\nThis leads me to believe the problem is a result of this bug filed for the latest update to winbind that affects groups: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/+bug/1573526\nI've temporarily removed sgrp from my volumes and they seem to be mounting now. Hopefully that bug will get resolved and it will properly fix this. Hope this helps.\nUPDATE: The bug linked above has been fixed and an update released, however I still had the same problem. Winbind was not returning group members for a given group (ie. \"getent group \" returned no members). Adding \"winbind expand groups = 1\" to smb.conf resolved this. I don't know if this relates to the new winbind update or not, but my groups are working again in pam_mount.conf.xml.\n\nA: Thanks to @chtaylor, I was originally able to resolve this by removing the sgrp attribute from all entries in pam_mount.conf.xml. Later I realized that the sgrp attribute works only if the group is user's primary group. So changing sgrp=\"residents\" to sgrp=\"domain users\" made the volumes available for me again because domain users is by default the primary group of all AD users. Another solution would be to change the primary group of desired users in Active Directory to match the pam_mount config:\nActive Directory Users and Computers > go to user properties > Member Of > Set Primary Group\n", "Q: secure boot issue : win10 & ubuntu16.04 I was asked to disable secure boot in order to install third party drivers on ubuntu 16.04. So I followed the instructions of MOK managemnt to disable secure boot.\nBut secure boot is still on in bios.

There will be an option where you can enable secure boot (just like you disabled after installing Ubuntu).\nManpage of mokutil: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/mokutil.1.html\n\nA: I have never noticed any difference in ubuntu's behaviour with secure boot on or off despite being told to enable and disable it for various reasons.\nSecure boot is little more than a marketing concept that adds no real security to Linux systems but does help mitigate some of the boot sector vulnerabilities that have plagued windows in the past.\n", "Q: gfortran and g77 I'm compiling WRF on my personal machine to play around, I've done it successfully on another computer of mine.

Is gfortran just the language and g77 a compiler and what's g95?\nIf anyone wants add why netcdf is such a struggle to download that would help to, it took me a couple of days to get it right.\nThanks\n\nA: g77 is the original GNU Fortran compiler - it is now deprecated in favor of gfortran. For a discussion of some of the differences and their implications see Where has g77 gone to?\ng95 is The other GCC-based Fortran compiler.

How can I install them?\n\nA: The Ubuntu Software app in Ubuntu does not have the same software in it as the classic Ubuntu Software Center has. Not only is there missing software in the Ubuntu Software app, but the Ubuntu Software app also has some GNOME software in it that the Ubuntu Software Center doesn't have. To be sure of finding all the available software, you need to have both the Ubuntu Software app and the Ubuntu Software Center installed. If you want to broaden your search to include snap packages in Ubuntu 16.04 and later, you have to search in the terminal to find available snap packages too.\nUbuntu 18.04 and later\nUbuntu Software and Synaptic are the top two software apps in Ubuntu 18.04 and they complement each other in functionality.\nIt should be noted that because software can be installed from both of these two GUI applications, only one of the following two applications should be opened and used to install software at the same time.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Software / Software – gnome-software\n\n*Synaptic package manager – synaptic\nUbuntu 17.04/17.10\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Software – gnome-software\n\n*Synaptic package manager – synaptic\n\n*Debian Package Search – packagesearch\nUbuntu 17.04 doesn't have Ubuntu Software Center in its default repositories. Synaptic Package Manager works fine in Ubuntu 17.04 and shows all the apps like Ubuntu Software Center does, however Synaptic does not provide the same rich user experience as Ubuntu Software.\nWhen I searched for a way of improving the package search functionality in Ubuntu 17.04, I found Debian Package Search (packagesearch). Debian Package Search is a GUI for searching packages and viewing package information. Debian Package Search can be installed alongside Synaptic and Ubuntu Software to add additional search functionality to Ubuntu 17.04 and 17.10 (discontinued in 18.04 and later).\nSearch in Debian Package Search can be done by:\n\n*\n\n*pattern\n\n*tags (based on the debtags system, a new way of categorizing\nDebian packages)\n\n*files\n\n*installed status\n\n*orphaned packages\n\nAdditionally a lot of information about the packages is displayed, including the files belonging to them.\nUbuntu 16.04/16.10\nUbuntu Software Center works fine in Ubuntu 16.04 and shows all the apps as it did in earlier versions of Ubuntu. Ubuntu Software Center can be installed in Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 16.10.\nsudo apt install software-center \n\n\nA: The new software center was a mess for the first couple of hours, and this faulty version doesn't seem to refresh itself while it keeps running in the background even after you've closed the window.\nYou can force quit it by invoking \nkillall gnome-software\nWhen you start the software center again it should update and look like a proper software center.\nIt's actually a very nice program now.\n\nA: I have experienced the same problem.  Until it is fixed, I suggest using Synaptic package manager.  All the packages are available there and it works very well.\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\nsudo apt-get install gksudo\ngksudo synaptic\n(it is safe to skip a step if already installed)\nSearch for your package (application) by name and right click and mark for install.  Then click apply.  You can uninstall by the same method.\n\nA: If the method above doesn't work you can try this:\nFirst, open the terminal and type this:\nps aux | grep apt\n\nYou will get a result in a table form, we are interested in the apt requests that contain the words http or software in them.\nOnce you find it, look at the second column. For example this is how it might look like:\nusername   2514  0.0  0.0  21376   948 pts/1    S+   22:37   0:00 apt-http\n\nThe results you get will be similar, but not exactly the same.\nNow, we want the second column for the above result: that's 2514 for me. Add it here (put the number you just got instead of 2514)\nsudo kill 2514\n\nRepeat the commands until you get no more unnecessary requests (chances are you will have to do it only once).\nNow start the ubuntu software and it should work!\n\nA: Removing unused dependency packages solved this problem for me.\nTo do this\n\n\n*\n\n*open a Terminal (using the Dash menu or CTRL+ALT+T and\n\n*type or insert sudo apt autoremove and press Enter.\n\n*You will be asked for your users password. You will not see anything while typing, this is normal and a security feature.\n\n*Now, restart the software center and try to search your packages.\n\n\nI hope it works as well for you as it did for me. Unfortunately I have no idea which package caused this problem.\n\nA: I had similar issues and I tried all the solutions mentioned above and no luck! Every time I click on the Software Center icon, it shows very few applications and I don't find common applications like Geany, Filezilla, and so on. On my laptop, I have the same version of Ubuntu 16.04 and there I find all applications by clicking on the Software Center icon. Finally, I started the Software Center from the command line and it loaded with all applications, thank God!  \nSolution (Open software center from terminal instead of clicking on the icon):\nshoeb@shoeb-OptiPlex-980:~$ software-center \n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 nvidia drivers don't work I've just installed a new ubuntu 16.04 ,\nfresh install clean , logged in the first and only thing i did is selecting the proprietary driver 361 for nvidia , rebooted the machine .\nanfter rebooting i can login but unity isn't showing , i can still right click though and open terminal , tried many answers:\nlink1\nlink2\ndid not help , i got frustrated , booted into usb and freshly installed it again, this time i tried 340 drivers same problem .\ni mean this is 16.04 LTS for gods sake .\ni have dual grahpic cards nvidia gt 740m , intel built on ASUS laptop . \noutput of grep \"EE\\|WW\" /var/log/Xorg.0.log :  \n(WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[    23.758] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic\" does not exist.\n[    23.758] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/\" does not exist.\n[    23.758] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/\" does not exist.\n[    23.758] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi\" does not exist.\n[    23.758] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi\" does not exist.\n[    23.761] (WW) \"glamoregl\" will not be loaded unless you've specified it to be loaded elsewhere.\n[    25.323] (WW) Unresolved symbol: fbGetGCPrivateKey\n[    25.448] (WW) NVIDIA(0): Unable to get display device for DPI computation.\n[    25.613] (WW) modeset(G0): Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" is not used\n[    25.613] (WW) modeset(G0): Option \"IgnoreDisplayDevices\" is not used\n[    25.902] (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to initiate mode change.\n[    25.902] (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to complete mode change\n[    26.214] (WW) evdev: SteelSeries Sensei Raw Gaming Mouse: ignoring absolute axes.\n[    26.216] (WW) evdev: SteelSeries SteelSeries Apex Raw Gaming Keyboard: ignoring absolute axes.\n[    26.272] (II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device \"USBest Technology SiS HID Touch Controller\" (type: TOUCHSCREEN, id 16)\n\nfull log file LOG\nxorg.conf file :  \nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier \"layout\"\n    Screen 0 \"nvidia\"\n    Inactive \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"intel\"\n    Driver \"modesetting\"\n    BusID \"PCI:0@0:2:0\"\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"None\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"intel\"\n    Device \"intel\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\n    BusID \"PCI:4@0:0:0\"\n    Option \"ConstrainCursor\" \"off\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    Device \"nvidia\"\n    Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"on\"\n    Option \"IgnoreDisplayDevices\" \"CRT\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: I had this problem too.

You can use prime-select intel or Nouveau driver as temporary workaround. I have had endless issues with the official Nvidia Ubuntu drivers over the years, it's very hit and miss. I thought the introduction of Steam OS and the growing number of Linux users/gamers might encourage them to better support Linux :/\n\nA: I also installed Ubuntu 16.04, clean install on a new hd and everything worked fine until I switched to NVIDIA driver. After rebooting I couldn't get past the login screen.

Can't see top or side panels  , the answer here works .\n\nA: I think I have found the solution. I have had terrible trouble with installing 16.04 on my main machine. Nvidia drivers crash and you can't log in and you have to resort to sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*. Chrome was crashing. \nI have had no trouble with my secondary machine which has a traditional bios. It is only my main machine with UEFI firmware. The most frustrating thing is that I had been running 16.04 from a daily build for some months and it was rock solid. \nI have noticed that the installer asks for a password if you download drivers as you install. The solution is to TURN OFF SECURE BOOT. Installing Ubuntu (from the UEFI option in the Bios Menu) then proceeds faultlessly and the system seems stable. 16.04 is not perfect e.g. to install Chrome you have to use gdebi, but at least it is now useable.\n\nA: For me the solution after lots of searching was to disable UEFI in the BIOS. My machine runs only Linux so disabling UEFI was not a big deal. \nI was having problems with VirtualBox and NVIDIA and could not get either to work with Ubuntu 16.  I was seaching for \"ubuntu 16 UEFI Virtual Box Fail kernel build\" and came across a link regarding Virtualbox that made me wonder about UEFI and disabling it.\nAfter disabling UEFI I reinstalled Ubuntu 16. During the install the dialog box that had the  \"Secure boot\" entry was devoid of that content.\nI'm happy to report that Ubuntu 16 is running and I'm having no problems with either NVIDIA or VirtualBox! Both are working as expected.\nThanks to those that shared their knowledge so I could move forward.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 comes with xserver Xorg 1.18 and the configuration is a little bit different than previously. In a dual GPU setup, from Arch Linux wiki, the /etc/X11/xorg.conf should be like this:\nSection \"Module\"\n    Load \"modesetting\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"nvidia\"\n    Driver \"nvidia\"\n    BusID \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n    Option \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\"\nEndSection\n\nReplace PCI:1:0:0 for your nvidia Bus ID. You can check it with:\n$ lspci | grep -E \"VGA|3D\"\n\nIt works for my HP laptop with dual GPU: Intel (Skylake) and NVIDIA 940m. Remember it's possible to switch between them with prime-select command (as root) or nvidia-settings official application and reboot your computer.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but my issue in particular was caused by the ESET NOD32 Antivirus. \nThe driver installation, both from the ubuntu repos and the manual NVIDIA driver installation was getting stuck building the DKMS modules.\nI found instructions on how to uninstall ESET and after uninstalling, I set my run-level to 3:\nsudo systemctl enable multi-user.target\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nBlacklist nouveau:\nEdit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf as super user and add:\nblacklist nouveau\n\nThen purge NVIDIA and reboot:\nsudo apt purge nvidia*\nsudo reboot\n\nOnce in run level 3, I manually installed the latest NVIDIA driver, set the run level back to 5 and rebooted.\nsudo sh ./NVIDIA...\nsudo systemctl enable graphical.target\nsudo systemctl set-default graphical.target\nreboot\n\nThings were finally working, so I re-installed the Antivirus.\nWill have to wait for a kernel update to ensure that the NVIDIA driver gets rebuilt then.\n", "Q: How to move, resize or remove KDE widgets since Plasma 5.5.5 (xenial) Until Plasma 5.4.2 (wily) widgets could be unlocked and showed a side menu when hovering over them with the mouse. The side menu allowed moving, resizing and removing the widget. With Plasma 5.5.5 (xenial) the side menu does not appear anymore.\n\nA: With Plasma 5.5.5 the menu appears after a long left-click (instead of hovering with the mouse in Plasma 5.4.2). This can be changed back in Desktop Settings (right click on desktop) -> Tweaks -> Widget Handling. This solution was first posted on bugs.kde.org.\n", "Q: network setting with xen hypervisor I have installed xen on my ubuntu 14.04 by following the instructions at here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2008795\nHowever, after the reboot, on the logo screen (still no desktop), it said waiting for network connection and then said waiting for 60 more seconds, finally it said starting without full network configuration.\nNow I don't have network connection.\nI think this is the problem:\nauto xenbr0\niface xenbr0 inet dhcp\n   bridge_ports eth0\n\nAnd, at here: http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Network_Configuration_Examples_(Xen_4.1%2B), I saw that what I need to do:\niface eth0 inet manual\n\niface xenbr0 inet static\n    bridge_ports eth0\n    address 192.168.1.2\n    broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nYou may ask why.

I have to use special DNS address.\nIf no, what should I do to get my network back?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you happen to use a computer which requires a static network setup (most use dhcp nowadays, but...), then you need to configure the bridge driver accordingly. That would be similar to the second example you posted.\nThe first (default one) would be the simplest-most case, where the machine get's its network from a DHCP server.\n", "Q: how to setup send-only email server on ubuntu I have a project coming soon and I need to send an email to around 300K people who might have the interest in the project. However I need to send them an email in the same day (the opening day) and as you know most of the web hosting companies won't let me send that amount of emails in the same day. So, I want to setup the email server at home and I'll code a script to send the emails in row so I don't push the server too far. \nHow can I setup my own email server on Ubuntu at home?\n\nA: How did you get your list of 300K addresses? If you did it correctly, there are certainly companies who will let you do this. Did you have people sign up to be on this list? If so, then a lot of hosting companies would be fine with you sending lots of mail out to reach everyone on your list. Mailchimp is one that comes to mind.\nAdditionally, most network operators/ISP block outgoing email that doesn't go through their server, so your plan may not work even if you get the server set right.\nIn addition, most ISPs will filter into the spam box any messages delivered directly from customer address space -- if they don't just straight up refuse the message when you try to hand it off. The same goes for dynamic address space (most end user connections are this) and IP addresses that don't have a non-numeric reverse DNS entry (so not things like 96-39-177.someisp.net). If you tell me what your address is, I can take a look and give you an idea of if messages from it would be accepted.\n", "Q: how do i install microsoft office from usb I am new to Ubuntu and I have tried using LibreOffice, but I face a lot of problem using LibreOffice Calc instead of MS Excel.\nPlease help me get MS Excel back so I can do my work smoothly.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can't. MS Office only runs on Windows.\nYou could try running it on WINE, but no guarantees.\nWINE stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator\nIt is a compatibility layer that allows running Win32 apps on Linux.\nHowever, it is FAR from perfect. Many applications will will simply crash during install or on luanch.\n\nYou can install wine with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nThen you can try installing office by double-clicking the setup EXE.\nIt will probably crash during install.\n\nA: You can install PlayOnLinux, which is a third party wine wrapper and contains various scripts to install Microsoft Office on Linux.\n\n", "Q: How to set Display Resolution while having to use \"NOMODESET\" on boot I have a Samsung laptop with a Radeon graphics chip.\nLive-Images and graphical installation have always worked on this laptop with the proper resolution of 1366x768. However, after Ubuntu had been installed, I ran into the black screen problem which so far, I solved by setting nomodeset temporarily during the first boot which gave me a resolution of 1024x768. Having booted like that, I would then install the fglrx driver, reboot and enjoy my Ubuntu with the proper resolution.\nSince I can't use the fglrx driver in Ubuntu 16.04 I am stuck with either a black screen (without using nomodeset) or a distorted display due to the wrong resolution of 1024x768. I tried setting the resolution manually with xrandr but I think since I have to use nomodeset there's no way that I can do that.\nIs there any way to fix this?\nI know that I could stick with Ubuntu 15.10 but I would really prefer an LTS version.\n\nA: I have 4 laptops upgraded with 16.04, and they all behave a little different with what GRUB accepts. The preferred way should be to set in /etc/default/grub \nGRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080x32\n\nwith the part after the equal sign the allowed resolutions for your device. Use either c at the GRUB prompt and enter vbeinfo, or run sudo hwinfo --framebuffer from the console in linux to get a list of accepted modes.\nSometimes, even if the screen is a 16:10 1920x1200 or similar, only a resolution of 1600x1200 is accepted, so watch out for this. This is the setting for GRUB. To have it carry over to the booting system, use a line\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep \n\nafter that.\nFor some devices, this (preferred) option has no effect. But for my two problem children, commenting out the GRUB_GFXMODE line, keeping the GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX line and using the deprecated option vga= with nomodeset was sufficient:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset vga=0x35a quiet splash\"\n\nsets the tty to 1600x1200 with 24 bit. Use the hex value sudo hwinfo --framebuffer gives you.\n\nA: I had the same problem and was finding nomodeset annoying not just because of the screen resolution, but because it really made compiz suck cpu. So I went back to not using nomodeset because I'd found that if I waited 5 minutes after booting, the screen would come on.\nAnyway, just now when I booted, it went black after the grub screen as usual, but the screen turned on just before the login screen appeared. I remembered I took an update this morning that included Ubuntu base, so I'm speculating that the problem was addressed. It isn't fully fixed, but is 95% better, so give it a go if you haven't taken this update yet.\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem. Blank screen on boot-time, that I've partially solved withe nomodeset. But after that, I could not use my external HDMI monitor.\nSo I've finally solved it by leaving GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" like that.

Now whenever I plug in my external hard disk, mediascanner-extractor starts consuming all my RAM and Swap space till my computer hangs and I have to force restart it.\nScreenshot Image Link Below \n\nA: I'm also running 16.04 and had a problem with this process just today. It wasn't smashing my RAM or swap, but mediascanner-service-2.0 and mediascanner-extractor-2.0 were preventing me from safely ejecting a USB drive with a lot of photos on it.\nAttempts to pskill the processes were immediately followed by the process restarting and continuing to hammer the drive. I used pstree to see what was calling mediascanner-service-2.0 and found that it was something called upstart, which was entirely unknown to me before this problem arose. With what little investigation I've done, I gleaned that upstart appears to be in charge of running various jobs and keeping them running.\nI found the upstart configuration for mediascanner-2.0 at:\n/usr/share/upstart/sessions/mediascanner-2.0.conf\n\nIt contained the following:\ndescription \"Media Scanner\"\nauthor \"James Henstridge <james.henstridge@canonical.com>\"\n\nstart on started dbus\n\nrespawn\nexec /usr/bin/mediascanner-service-2.0\n\nNeedless to say, the respawn command is apparently what instructs upstart to restart mediascanner-service-2.0 (which calls mediascanner-extractor-2.0) whenever I killed it.\nSomeone in #ubuntu on irc.freenode.org gave me this solution:\necho manual > ~/.config/upstart/mediascanner-2.0.override\n\nThis will override the aforementioned configuration, telling upstart to ignore start and stop commands for mediascanner-2.0, leaving the program and its configuration present, but stopping it from running and scanning everything automatically.\nYou can read more about upstart and its configuration here:\nhttp://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\nSince you're on the same version as me, I suspect this solution will work for you as it did for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Cannot Use USB Audio: fwupd Bug In 15.10, both internal Intel and external USB audio were working.

After I manually unpacked the steam runtime tarball package under the Steam directory to overwrite what I previously had there, it changed to be as described in this problem (pcre_jit_stack_alloc).\nAn interesting tidbit is that before I found the solution above, I was able to start Steam so it downloaded an upgrade for itself by disabling the Steam Runtime temporarily with export STEAM_RUNTIME=0.

It seems that the upgrade includes a Wicd applet (added to Metacity Classic Gnome task bar alongside regular network icon), but doesn't seem to work after a suspend. A sudo service network-manager restart duplicates this problem. It takes a complete reboot to get Wifi going again. Any ideas why?\n\nA: To auto-restart NetworkManager after resume in an environment without sudo access, create a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d (any name), set the executable bit via chmod +x, and insert the following content:\ncase \"${1}\" in\n    resume|thaw)\n        # systemctl restart network-manager.service\n        service NetworkManager restart\n;;\nesac\n\nFor me, the service line worked, but systemctl may work better for you.\nSource: https://askubuntu.com/a/92235/30266.\n\nA: For me it seems to be random, but sometimes the wifi just disconnects if I'm connected, or doesn't show networks if I'm not. Sometimes putting my laptop into sleep mode seems to trigger it, but not always.\nSome combination of these usually gets it going again without rebooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo iwlist $(ifconfig | grep -Po '^w\\w+') scan\n\n*sudo service network-manager stop; sleep 5; sudo service network-manager start\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply calling restart here never seems to work for me. It looks like it tries to start it up before it's finished shutting it down, hence I have more luck pausing between stop and start.\n\n\n*Turn off wifi in UI; wait a few seconds; turn it back on\n\n\nNone of those seems to consistently work, but I listed them in order of most-likely-to-succeed first.\n\nA: @147pm Did you ever get this working?\nI found I had a quite similar problem, though I am on Kubuntu 16.10 (KDE-based, not Gnome), and with an HP ProBook laptop. And, unlike yourself, it wasn't my Wifi which died after suspend/wakeup, but my ethernet port.\nStill, I wonder if they are related.\nI also do see that you do not have the problem under KDE. But I would be interested to know if the solution below does help under Gnome, as the solution is not based upon window manager, desktop environment or applets.\nFirst, just to confirm that restarting the network manager service..\n$ sudo systemctl restart network-manager.service\n\ndid not work for me.\nHowever, I did find an answer that worked, thanks to buzhidao's question and info at can't connect to internet after suspend and GAD3R's comment there.\nUsing their info, I found that first researching which ethernet hardware and driver/module I am running, and then removing and reloading that module, did work for me (though it did not for buzhidao):\nWifi:\n$ lspci -knn | grep Net -A2\n\nEthernet:\n$ lspci -knn | grep Ether -A2\n\nThe second of these (ethernet) was what I used, and I found:\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller [10ec:8168] (rev 0c)\n        Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller [103c:1944]\n        Kernel driver in use: r8169\n        Kernel modules: r8169\n\nso i reloaded the 'r8169' driver:\n$ sudo rmmod r8169 && sudo modprobe r8169\n\nand voila! This worked.  My ethernet port / connection came back alive (after suspend/wakeup) without having to reboot.\n(I also did NOT have a Realtek wifi device, but a Qualcomm Atheros (mod: ath9k) which perhaps explains why wifi continued to work for me after wake-from-suspend.)\nAs you can see from my comment on that other post, I wondered whether the problem is the common element between Buzhidao and myself: Realtek Semiconductor devices. Even though they use different modules, they might share some common code? Or even be treated differently by the newer kernel code now in some way?\nDo you yourself have a Realtek-based wifi device? (using lspci above)?  Do you have any luck re-installing the module (rmmod/modprobe above)?\nAnyway, just a shot in the dark. If you have found an eventual answer for yourself, please let us know!

Thanks for helping me\n\nA: It should say to you to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, but for some reason it does not. \nBut there is a workaround around your situation. Go to something else. Then you must know which partitions are your Windows partitions.(You will probably have a 100mb Windows system aprtition, and one or two other Windows partitions, However instead of C or D it will be called something like SDA1, SDA2, SDA3, ...)\nAfter that you will need to make a partition for Ubuntu. You should create a partition for Ubuntu from unpartitioned space on your hard drive if possible. If not you should either shrink your existing NTFS(Windows) partitions or you should reformat one of your NTFS partition into EXT4(but this will erase all your data on that partition). Tell the program to use that partition as / .\nEither way after you have created an EXT4 partition you just select that partition and tell the installer to install the system on it.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n", "Q: Can not switch language with hotkey keyboard I have added the locale language at installation.

I have a very little knowledge about the 'Snap packaging format'. What I know is that 'Snap' is an alternative packaging format like .deb. \nWhat I don't know is \n\n\n*\n\n*Why did Canonical chose it?\n\n*What are the main advantages of 'Snap' over .deb?\n\n*Will .deb be abandoned, or is it already abandoned?\n\n\nA: Why did Canonical chose snaps?\nTo quote the Ubuntu website:\n\nWe originally created the snappy technology and application\n  confinement system to ensure a carrier-grade update experience for\n  Ubuntu mobile users and set a new standard for application security in\n  the mobile era.\n\nEssential idea was to fix issues that are present in both .deb packages and provide new method for updating the packages (the so called transactional updates , very similar to how android apps are updated). As Mark Shuttleworth explains:\n\nWhenever we make a fix to packages in Ubuntu, we’ll publish the same\n  fix to Ubuntu Core, and systems can get that fix transactionally. In\n  fact, updates to Ubuntu Core are even smaller than package updates\n  because we only need to send the precise difference between the old\n  and new versions, not the whole package.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of .snap packages over .deb packages?\nThe biggest advantage is the improved security. PPAs and .deb packages are typically installed with root privillege , which opens up a venue for security risks. \nSnappy apps are isolated, meaning that if some app breaks, it won't break your systems. To quote Mark Shuttleworth:\n\nSnappy packages are automatically confined to ensure that a bug in one\n  app doesn’t put your data elsewhere at risk\n\nWill .deb be abandoned?\nAs of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS , both methods are available to the users. \nTo quote OMG! Ubuntu!:\n\nCanonical also say that “…the tens of thousands of applications and\n  packages in .deb format will continue to be supported in 16.04 and\n  beyond, and deb archives in particular will continue to be available\n  for all to use and distribute software.”\n\n\nA: As an overview, as far as I understand snaps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Snaps are more secure. Running in own \"containers\".\n\n*It's much more easy to handle with snaps than with deb packages.\n\n*In the future, snaps will be the package format for mobile devices, internet of things and desktop.\n\n*is or will be .deb abandoned? Canonical said, there will be support deb packages also in the future.\nBut there is a tool called snapcraft. With this tool its very easy to convert deb packages into snap packages.\nFollow this link for more information.

If I create new files and directories in my home directory, these are group writable by default:\nwill@together:~$ touch test\nwill@together:~$ mkdir test_dir\nwill@together:~$ ll | grep test\n-rw-rw-r--  1 will will         0 Apr 23 10:36 test\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 will will      4096 Apr 23 10:36 test_dir/\n\nThe reason for this behavior is due to the Debian/Ubuntu way of handling users and groups, called User Private Groups.\nI just did a fresh install of Ubuntu and I noticed that the automatically created directories (Documents, Desktop, etc.) are not group writable.\nwill@together:~$ ll | grep Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 will will      4096 Apr 22 22:21 Documents/\n\nI was just wondering what the reason for this is.\n\nA: First, you can ll -d Documents, and save grep for when it's needed.  \nIn /etc/adduser.conf one finds:  \n# If DIR_MODE is set, directories will be created with the specified\n# mode. Otherwise the default mode 0755 will be used.\nDIR_MODE=0751\n\nSee man adduser and man adduser.conf.\n\nA: This is because in /etc/login.defs the default umask is set to 022 when your home directory is created. 022 is the \"historical\" umask that existed before the idea of private groups emerged. But USERGROUPS_ENAB yes in /etc/login.defs changes it to 002 (for anything created after your home directory is created).  \nConfigurations in /etc/adduser.conf will override the one mentioned above only if private groups are disabled. The motivation to move to 002 is that with the emergence of private groups, 022 became very restrictive for eg: to set up shared directories. \nYou can see more information on this in the Lauchpad and Debian bug log. In addition, from /etc/login.defs:\n> # UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by\n> # useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.\n> # 022 is the \"historical\" value in Debian for UMASK\n> # 027, or even 077, could be considered better for privacy\n> # There is no One True Answer here : each sysadmin must make up his/her\n> # mind.\n> #\n> # If USERGROUPS_ENAB is set to \"yes\", that will modify this UMASK default value\n> # for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is\n> # the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be\n> # used as group permissions, e. g. 022 will become 002.\n\n# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits\n# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is\n# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.\n#\n# If set to yes, userdel will remove the user´s group if it contains no\n# more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name\n# of the user.\n#\nUSERGROUPS_ENAB yes\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to add more spaces to Ubuntu Drive (where the home is)?

If you want to keep up on the bug reports for your card not working with bluetooth and flaky wifi you can read what others have tried and sign up here\n\nA: Unfortunately Realtek shows nothing for an RTL8723BE, but the WiFi drivers for Linux can be downloaded directly from Realtek, here: Realtek PCIe WiFi driver page\nHere is an AskUbuntu page which seems to solve the WiFi problem for this Reaktek card: Wifi problems with rtl8723be in Ubuntu 14.04\nThere was an answer which appears to have solved the bluetooth problem in AskUbuntu: RTL8723BE Bluetooth does not work\nThose should solve your issue.\nRespectfully,\nDavid\n", "Q: What are some interesting features of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? Ubuntu 16.04 LTS has just been released and we are very eager to enjoy it.\nFrom its features, I have noticed headphone and some other driver support in Mac, new music and video interface, themes etc.\nNow, I want to know about some interesting features of this version so that I can enjoy it the best. Can you help me to list them?\nRethink:\nI asked only for interesting features, not the whole feature list. Whole feature list is in everyone's hand. More precisely, the question is: which features one must try once while exploring Ubuntu 16.04 LTS?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: *\n\n*The most exciting for a long time Ubuntu Unity user is that you can\nmove it to the bottom. \n\n*You can also control desktop notifications for various applications.\n\n*Ubuntu Software Center has been replaced by GNOME Software.\n\n*You can use Snap packages.\n\n\nSource: http://itsfoss.com/features-ubuntu-1604/\n\nA: Quote from OMG Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS ships with a modified version of Linux 4.4 kernel.\nIt introduces numerable improvements to system stability, performance, power efficiency, and file system handling, and introduces support for newer Intel and AMD hardware.\nImproved Intel Skylake processor support\n      3D support in the virtual GPU driver\n      New driver for Corsair Vengeance K90\n      Support for TPM 2.0 chips\n      Journaled RAID 5 support\nIt also introduces drivers for the Logitech G29 racing wheel and enables support for hardware features on some newer Toshiba laptops.\n\nSource: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/ubuntu-16-04-download-new-features\n", "Q: My system is not shutting down after installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS! I was using Ubuntu 15.10 and everything was working fine. But yesterday I installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and now its not shutting down. I have to plug away my battery to turn it off and also the battery indicator is not working!\n\nA: If you look at your shutdown log, you will most-likely see a line which says \"plymouthd has been excluded from killing...\"\nRedhat already has a note on this function in their bugs report. It appears related to Fedora. Everyone is offering band-aids to this, at this time, but even if you take ownership from root for plymouthd or go to a non-splash shutdown, it appears not to stop the problem. The problem is very persistent (for whatever reason) on Dell and HP computers, too. (I can't get a single Dell laptop to shutdown by proper shutdown command, after Ubuntu 16.04LTS is installed).\nThis should be considered a MAJOR bug, due to the ramifications to hardware as a result of doing the old 'hold the power button for 8-10 seconds' process.\nThe problem resides in plymouthd being excluded from being killed. Who in their right mind protects a SPLASH SCREEN on exit, so that it can't be killed, so that the harddrive can't be remounted in ro mode, so that logoff can be successfully conducted?\n", "Q: Psensor usage and CPU load When p sensor is being displayed top shows CPU usage some thing low like 1 or 2 percent.\nWhen I minimize p sensor top shows CPU usage goes wild 50, 60, 80 percent.\nWhat gives?\nSide issue I could not write p sensor in this message due to some error handling issues, please pardon.\n\nA: This is a bug but here is a workaround until there is a bug fix.  Close the psensor graph window instead of minimizing it.  When you want to view the psensor graph window again right click the little psensor thermometer icon in the panel (top bar), click \"Show\" and then click the psensor icon on the Launcher (left sidebar) to show and put focus on the psensor graph window.\nThe spike in CPU usage doesn't only occur when the psensor graph window is minimized but anytime the graph window does not have the focus.  You can verify this by having just one other small window on the desktop, Terminal for instance, and Alt-Tab between them.  You'll see the CPU usage jump and fall as you do.\nThis is a bug with psensor 1.1.3-2ubuntu3 in ubuntu 16.04. The jump in CPU usage does not occur in an identically configured psensor 1.1.3-2ubuntu2 in ubuntu 15.10.\nI'm running a custom built PC with an AMD A8-3870 APU and no discrete graphics card or motherboard graphics.  I am not using proprietary graphics drivers just the default graphics with ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04.\n", "Q: How to disable avahi-daemon in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? How to disable avahi-daemon in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS? I have tried\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'manual'>/etc/init/avahi-daemon.override\"\n\nbut seems it does not work.\nAnd how to disable cups-browsed? I have tried\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'manual'>/etc/init/cups-browsed.override\"\n\nbut seems it does not work.\n\nA: Since 16.04 is a systemd system, you need to do\nsudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.socket\nsudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service\n\nAlso, the cups-browsed.service \"Wants\" avahi to start, so you'll either have to disable that, too, or comment out the line in /lib/systemd/system/cups-browsed.service:\nWants=avahi-daemon.service\n\nThen you don't need to uninstall anything.\nThis won't take effect until reboot, but you can do\nsudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket\nsudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon.service\n\nIf you want to stop it right away.\n\nA: After trying a couple of things, the one wich worked for me was\napt-get remove avahi-daemon\n\n\nA: I have tried  \nupdate-rc.d -f avahi-daemon remove  \necho manual > /etc/init/avahi-daemon.override\nsystemctl disable avahi-daemon\nsystemctl disable avahi-service\n\nbut still avahi-daemon came up after reboot.\nSo I ended up with\napt-get purge avahi-daemon\nwhich finally solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Laggy Youtube performance Youtube works fine in Windows, but in Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 video is very not smooth.

My ram is 8GB. \n\n*We check two options when installing Ubuntu (one is mp3 fluendo plugin and the other is about restricted extras). Does Ubuntu need internet connection to install them during installation?\n\n*Is it recommended to have internet connection during installation?\nCan i download and install everything that Ubuntu downloads during installation later? How?\n\nA: *\n\n*It is an argued question, but my opinion is that with 8 or more GB of RAM you don't need swap unless you use suspend to disk. If you are sure you need swap it should be at least the size of your RAM.\n\n*I don't know if they are downloaded or installed from your installation media, but you can install them any time you want later from the corresponding packages (i.e. the ubuntu-restricted-extras meta package and its dependencies).\n\n*You can install all the updates later via the regular updates procedure. However I believe that it's better to download and install them during the system installation process as it might prevent some bugs.\n\n", "Q: 16.04 LTS vs 16.04.1 upgrade What's going on?  I am told that if I want to upgrade (from 14.04 LTS) I should have that \"Let me know of new LTS versions\" checkbox checked (which I do) in my software updates settings.  However, if I want to upgrade I must download 16.04.  Or, I can wait 3 months until 16.04.1 comes out and then it will just upgrade through software updater.  If it's an upgrade, why need I download?\n\nA: To have a check you can simply do from terminal\ndo-release-upgrade -c\n\nthis will check if the actual release is open. If yes run the command\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nwithout any parameter.\n\nA: New LTS releases are only offered at the first “point release”: 14.04.1, 16.04.1, (probably) 18.04.1, etc.  This is done because by then most of the bugs that only show up after a release goes public will be fixed, and people who prefer LTS releases usually prefer a stable system that works without giving them too much trouble.\nYou can (temporarily) select the option to inform you about all new releases instead of only new LTS releases if you want to be offered an update now.

There's no opposition to it (but then again, there's not much activity at all related to that request).\nEven if it does get implemented in a later version, I'm not sure the feature will be backported to Ubuntu 16.04. Consider filing a bug report on Launchpad linking to the upstream bug report to notify Ubuntu devs of the request.\n", "Q: Paper theme on Ubuntu Unity I can't install the paper theme on Ubuntu Unity.

I am new to ubuntu so please i need your help . Also , i don't want to lose my data .\n\nA: With any upgrade, there's always a (very minimal) chance of data loss. With that being said, it is really easy to upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04, and there's no reason you'd be likely to lose any data in the process.\nYou don't even need to enter a terminal. Just open the \"Software Updater\" program. There should be a button that says \"Upgrade...\" Just hit that button and wait for about 20 minutes.\nTroubleshooting: If the upgrade button isn't there, make sure you have all available updates installed and restart software updater. Make sure you're connected to the internet. In the update preferences dialog, make sure you check \"Notify my about all new versions\".\n", "Q: create home backup server I guess I've got a more general question regarding the creating of a home backup server, a project which I wanted to do anyways and seems to get more and more important with locky etc.\nI've got an old pc running ubuntu server 14.04 currently, might upgrade it soon. I've got a music player running and would like to create a \"storage\" part e.g. for music and stuff and a \"backup\" part. I want a (once implemented) good solution to trigger the backup process from windows and linux PCs and not having to put in external HDDs etc.\nIs it at all possible to only use the HDD for the backup process? If I created a backup server I would want the HDD only spinning while I do my backups or restore my files (to extend its life). I would want that PC to be running most of the time and providing other functions so power off isn't an option.\nWhat are your favourite programs for doing this? I don't want anything cloud based. Currently I access that computer only via SSH and it should stay that way.\nI'd love some input from which I can keep informing myself about the whole thing (doesn't need to be a whole guide, I can do some research myself, however if there is a great guide, I'd love to read it). I'm relativly new to linux so please keep it somewhat understandable (or add a wiki article which I should be reading for some fundamental knowledge).\n\nA: For backing up stuff remotely without cloud, you can try BitTorrent Sync. \nHere is an answer on how to set it up on Ubuntu: \nHow to run BitTorrent Sync?\nI personally have a few different boxes running BTSync, making sure I have multiple physical backups available at all times. It is quite simple to use and is cross-platform.\n\nA: Unison is a great tool for syncing between multiple systems over SSH. It provides two way syncing and works on all platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows). You can run it either through shells, or, for MacOSX and Windows, there is also a GUI option. \nI just set one up between all 3 platforms (Win, OSX, Linux) using a Desktop as the \"server\" and syncing from a few laptops for Music, Photos, etc. I simply made a bash script invoking something like\nunison -auto -silent -times \"${PWD}\" \"ssh://${SERVER}//super/cool/path/\" -path /sub/path/ -path /another/sub/path\n\nAnd then attached it to a cron job.\n", "Q: Why did Canonical drop support for Gimp and how to recover from it? I was offered an upgrade to 16.04. During the upgrade, I saw this:\n\nI can kinda see why Expect and w3m are being dropped, but why Gimp? \nMore importantly, how to do I find pre-built packages that I can install via apt-get or the Ubuntu Software Center (but they are dropping the \"Center\" part of that).\nWhat does \"the community\" mean?\n\nA: That GIMP is no longer supported by Canonical doesn't mean it won't be available in Ubuntu's repositories. It will be, but not in the main section, instead, in the universe section.\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between multiverse, universe, restricted and main?\n\n*How do I enable the \"Universe\" repository?\nFrom the package index:\n\nPackage gimp\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*precise (12.04LTS) (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program\n  2.6.12-1ubuntu1.3 [security]: amd64 i386\n  2.6.12-1ubuntu1 [ports]: armhf powerpc  \n  \n*precise-updates (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program\n  2.6.12-1ubuntu1.3: amd64 armhf i386 powerpc  \n  \n*trusty (14.04LTS) (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program\n  2.8.10-0ubuntu1: amd64 arm64 armhf i386 powerpc ppc64el  \n  \n*wily (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program\n  2.8.14-1ubuntu2: amd64 arm64 armhf i386 powerpc ppc64el  \n  \n*xenial (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program [universe]\n  2.8.16-1ubuntu1: amd64 arm64 armhf i386 powerpc ppc64el s390x  \n  \n*yakkety (graphics): The GNU Image Manipulation Program [universe]\n  2.8.16-1ubuntu1: amd64 arm64 armhf i386 powerpc ppc64el s390x  \n  \n\n\"The community\" is anyone not paid by Canonical to work on Ubuntu: the army of volunteers who work on Ubuntu (basically most people who contribute to the development of Ubuntu). \n\n\n*\n\n*Contribute to the Ubuntu Community \n\n*How can I contribute to Ubuntu?\n\nSoftware in main is either software that's shipped on Ubuntu's official released ISOs, or crucial software that Canonical developers feel they can or should support for the duration of the release (5 years for LTS). GIMP was dropped from Ubuntu's ISOs in 10.04, and I'm amazed it remained in main for 6 years after that. Probably whoever maintained it in Canonical moved on to other projects.\n\nA: The ubuntu repositories are split into four parts.\n\n\n*\n\n*main: free software supported by canonical\n\n*restricted: non-free software supported by canonical (firmware, drivers etc)\n\n*universe: free software not supported by canonical\n\n*multiverse: non-free software not supported by canonical\n\n\nSoftware not in main is not supported by canonical. The main practical impact of this for those of us who don't buy support contracts is that security updates are much less likely to appear in a timely manner and towards the end of the release lifecycle may not appear at all. \nIn general stuff gets into main because it's part of one of Ubuntus default installs. Gimp was dropped from the default install some time ago and I guess they just finally got around to removing it from main too.\nDoes that matter? In general I would say no, an image editor typically has relatively low exposure to security threats. Especially as the image formats themselves are typically handled by external libraries which (at least for the common formats) will probablly still be in main. \nSo to answer your \"how to recover from it\" question in the title I would suggest you just don't worry about it. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Window Spread is glitchy and makes the screen freeze I'm on Ubuntu 16.04. When I turn off window spread from Unity Tweak Tool then try to turn it back on, I'm always geting glitches and a frozen screen when I activate window spread. Is there any fix for this?\nFixed now: restarting Unity fixes it.\n\nA: I had the same issue. First I used the answer from edanpose and thanks to it Unity stopped freezing, but after I pressed super+W the screen wallpaper was showing up for about a second and then everything was back to normal, but spread was not working.\nThen after reading this Ubuntu Forum thread I installed compizconfig-settings-manager (CCSM) in order to check whether the scale plugin is enabled (as I understand it is related with window scaling used in window thread).\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen in CCSM Window Management, one can enable Scale window.

I tried with every free disk partition software I could find. so I tried installing Lubuntu (smaller than 1GB) thinking it was small enough but I still couldn't install it from windows.\nI couldn't use gparted because it had to be as bootable image with Windows and I didn't figure a way around that.\nI then followed these instructions, the top answer tells you how to do it, ignore the 1st half of the answer as that is for BIOS, follow the UEFI part.\nthat linked answer DID NOT WORK BUT it did successfully install the \"rEFInd\" (not grub2) boot menu entry.\nWhen I tried to boot from that it would automatically bypass back to Windows.\n(I don't know if that step was necessary or not, but that's what I did).\nCAUTION: THAT STEP MIGHT BE COMPLETELY IRREVERSIBLE and completely removes Windows.\nWhat worked for me then was I opened up a different free partition manager \n(not tenorshare this time) and I deleted the windows system partition altogether (as I have no interest in using Windows again or dualbooting)\nOnce I hit apply changes in the disk partition manager the screen turned black, after reboot it went to the rEFInd bootscreen and said there was nothing to boot or something like that.\nThen I rebooted going into the UEFI BIOS settings (F2 or F12), I found the \"Secure Boot\" option and diabled it, then I went to \"Exit saving changes\".\nOn another computer I downloaded \"etcher\" for windows (cross platform software) and the gparted ISO image and I used etcher to made a bootable USB of gparted.\nI rebooted my lenovo with my USB connected and it booted gparted, I used that to completely delete all partitons on my disk, I created a partition table in \"GPT\" format (\"ms-dos\" aka \"MBR\" would have probably worked but my hard disk had already been on GPT so I chose that).\nThen I created a partition leaving 2GB left. I formatted the partition to \"ext4\" \"primary\". then I made the last 2GB into a partition formatted to \"linux-swap\".\nI exited this and turned off the laptop.\nI downloaded loads of versions of linux (various flavours of ubuntu, linuxmint and elementary OS).\nWith trial and error I went one by one through these different OSes.

All that I needed was a couple of sed commands.\nsudo sed -i -- 's/#deb-src/deb-src/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo sed -i -- 's/# deb-src/deb-src/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThen sudo apt-get update and continue on.\n\nA: Open Software & Updates and enable \"Source code\".\n\nA: simpler solution that does what the others have posted more succinctly:\nsudo perl -p -i -n -e \"s/# *deb-src/deb-src/\"  /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nKey distinctions:  Perl has the -i inplace option which modifies files in place; I did not add a suffix for backup files because I didn't want the backup files to accidentally be treated as data files.  And \" *\" deals with optional whitespace.   \"perl -p -n -e\" is mostly the same as  \"sed -e\", though watch out for greedy regex matching.\nIt has the same limitations the others do: it enables sources even if the original wasn't enabled (i.e. partners), and it doesn't work on /etc/apt/sources.list.d.   The following will also process /etc/apt/sources.list.d* but makes a backup first.\n(cd /etc/apt/; sudo tar cvf sources.list.tar sources.list sources.list.d);  for i in /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*; do sudo perl -p -i -n -e \"s/# *deb-src/deb-src/\" $i; done\n\n\nA: Here is a simplification of @Tobi's result that does it on a single call to sed:\nsed -i -- 's/#\\s\\?deb-src/deb-src/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nThis adds \\s\\? which is an optional white space (note the ? needs to be escaped).\n", "Q: Kubuntu doesn't work after upgrade to 16.04 I have a new System76 Lemur Laptop.  It worked fine for a week.  I installed Kubuntu, it worked fine.  Then I upgraded to Kubuntu 16.04 LTS and the system doesn't boot fully anymore.  The Kubuntu logo flashes but then never displays the login UI, I just see black.  I can get a TTY by pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 key.  I can run startx -- :1 from the TTY to get a bare bones graphical interface.  \nHow can I get a usable graphical interface?  \n\nA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm\n\nand selecting sddm worked for me.\n\nA: Run\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall kubuntu-desktop plasma-desktop plasma-desktop-data sddm xorg xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-intel && sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm\n\nThe 1st part will reinstall kubuntu's KDE plasma, the X11 display server, the sddm display manager, and the intel video driver; the next will allow you to set it as the default display manager. If some of those packages aren't installed, it will attempt to install them.\nLogs are located at /var/log. Look for the log for Xorg and sddm.\n\nA: Note - This message only aims at proprietary nvidia drivers users. I'm not sure if your laptops has one, but it may help for other people that were in the same situation. :\nI just encountered a similar issue after updating my Kubuntu 16.04 setup (it already worked fine with it). Messing around KDE packages didn't help. However I noticed that Plasma was actually working but I didn't get any real visual feedback (right click worked as if plasma was properly started). I could start in a konsole using alt+f2 and blindly launching it. Manually restarting KWin (kwin_x11 --replace) showed me that compositing got disabled because of the lack of GLX extension in the X server. It was confirmed by glxgears not willing to start.\nSo I dropped in a TTY, logged in, sudo service lightdm stop (note : the default DM under Kubuntu is sddm so it most likely would be sudo service sddm stop), reinstalled the nvidia drivers, rebooted and it was back working.\nI wonder if it was just about the X.org config (so try messing around nvidia-xconfig first) that got replaced or if the upgrade nuked up some GLX libraries.\nHopefully this will help you and some others going by!\n\nA: Same problem.

How to run a Python program directly?\nI have created a .py file (say, mnik.py) in gedit. It runs smoothly in terminal.\nCommand goes \npython3 mnik.py\n\nBut whenever I click on the file it is opened with gedit. I cannot run it directly by clicking.\nWhat to do?\n\nA: You need to put the location of the program to execute your code on the first line and you then need to set the script to run as an executable by changing its permissions. This assumes you're launching your applications from terminal or another script.\nFind your Python installation\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\nAdd the programs location to the top line of your program with a #! in front\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\n# Python code goes here....\n\nSet the Python script to have execution rights\n$ chmod 700 test.py\n\nNow you can run the script directly\n$ ./test.py\n\nCode listing for test.py\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nprint \"test\"\n\n\nA: There's two things needed. \n\n\n*\n\n*A script must have #! line telling the OS which interpreter to use. In your case your very first line in the code must be #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n*You need to open file manager , go to Edit -> Preferences -> Behavior, and select what to do with executable files\n\n\n\n*Finally , make sure your file itself actually has executable permissions set. In terminal you can do chmod +x /path/to/script.py and in GUI, right click on the file and alter its Properties -> Permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote about shebang line\n\nThe very first line is called shebang line and must start with #! ; whatever comes next is the name of the interpreter that will read your code. In case you are using python3 you could use either #!/usr/bin/python3 or  #!/usr/bin/env python3 for portability. If you are not using code that will be specific to python version - just use #!/usr/bin/env python\nNote on the script output:\nIf your script prints output to console, it will need to have terminal window, or alternatively use GUI dialogs such as zenity.  Prefer using Run in Terminal option if you want to see the code. If you want the script to do something without seeing console output - use Run option.\n\nIn addition, if you have command line parameters , such as sys.argv[1] in the script , you can't set them unless you have terminal window open. \n\nA: If you want to run this program without typing python3 mnik.py you have to make the script executable and make sure that python3 is used to run it.\nThe first you can do by running\n chmod +x mnik.py\n\nthe second you can do by adding as the first line of a script a shebang line that invokes python3. On all the Ubuntu systems I have worked with that came with python3, you can get python3 by adding this line at the top:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nAfter those two changes you can type /path/to/mnik.py, ./mnik.py or just mnik.py (the latter requires the script to be in your PATH).\nIf you make these changes you might also want to consider renaming mnik.py to mnik, that is common practice with Python packages with commands that are published on PyPI.\n\nA: I have found a workaround if you don't want to bother with setting your script as an executable, adding comments to your code or selecting to run from the terminal every time you run it.\nGo to ~/.local/share/applications, create a new .desktop file there. Call it something like python-run.desktop. Paste the following into it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Run Python Script\nComment=Python Interpreter\nExec=gnome-terminal -- /bin/bash -c 'python3 %f;echo \"$(tput setaf 1)Program terminated.\\nPress enter to exit...$(tput sgr 0)\"; read'\nIcon=/usr/share/pixmaps/python3.6.xpm\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=Development;\nStartupNotify=true\nNoDisplay=true\n\nThis is mostly copied from the .desktop file of python interpreter itself. The difference is when you open it, it runs a new instance of the terminal line with the command: python3 %f;echo \"$(tput setaf 1)Program terminated.\\nPress enter to exit...$(tput sgr 0)\"; read', which runs the script (%f is apparently the file's path), then pauses on exit.\nThen go to nautilus, right click on the script, go to Properties → Open With and select Run Python Script, the \"Application\" we just created. Now when you double click, it should run the script from the terminal.\nIt's a pretty good workaround but I have found 2 problems with it:\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't work with scripts that have a space in their name.\n\n*It opens a separate terminal window which is pretty annoying. For some reason, I couldn't get it to work by just setting Exec=python3 %f, it kept giving me an end of file exception whenever the program tried to get input. No idea why.\n\n", "Q: Error while trying to dual boot Ubuntu 15.10 and Windows 10 Being specific, \nWhen I was trying to install Ubuntu 15.10, my other operating system remains undetected.\n\"Multiple OS detected\"\nBut still it wont let me dual boot my Windows 10 and Ubuntu.\nPlease help.\n\nA: I just tried to go over it myself and was able to dual both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10 by the following method : \nIn Windows 10, \nOpen up partition manager and dislocate some space out of your windows partition for Ubuntu(don't really write anything).\nThen boot into Ubuntu 15.10 installation and click \n\ndo something else\n\nAfter that select the space you just cleared up and format it as EXT4(Linux file-system).\nIt will peacefully install.\nPEACE!\n", "Q: 404 NOT FOUND when I try to access my project's index.php I have a 404 NOT FOUND when I try to access my project's index.php with LAMP installed.

I have a huge folder of images that I've collected over the years that my students use for coursework. It started off with about twenty images so I didn't really bother with file names or any kind of structure, just tagged them and chucked them in. That same folder now has about 5000 images in it and it's getting to the point where it's hard to work with. \nIdeally I'd like to be able to run a command (now and in the future as more are submitted) that would look at the images tag(s) and create a directory with the name of the tag and move that image into it, or if a previous image has already created that directory simply move the image into that directory. \nI'm not sure I'm doing a very good job explaining this.\nThe first 5 images for example are cars - BMW, Honda, Ford, Alfa Romeo and another BMW. The file names are all unique - they're all in the same folder remember. So after the running this mythical script I'd have 4 folders with the 2 images in the BMW one. \nEverything is tagged in Shotwell, it's mostly JPGs with a few PNGs thrown in just to complicate things!

Subject, Keywords do not preserve the tag hierarchy—you can use them if you don't want to create nested directories for nested tags.\nHere's python3 script that moves image files specified on the command line to the corresponding tag directories (by creating hardlinks and removing original filename) e.g., if example.jpg has the tags list: nature, nature/clouds, nature/mountain, nature/sky then the result directory tree looks like:\n.\n└── nature\n    ├── clouds\n    │   └── example.jpg\n    ├── example.jpg\n    ├── mountain\n    │   └── example.jpg\n    └── sky\n        └── example.jpg\n\nNote: always backup your data before running potentially destructive commands (bugs happen):\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Move image files to their tag directories by creating hardlinks.\n\nUsage: move-to-tag-dirs <image>...\n\"\"\"\nimport json\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n\nTAGNAMES = ['TagsList', 'Keywords', 'Subject']\n__version__ = '0.3.1'\n\n\ndef move_to_dirs(filename, dirs):\n    \"\"\"Move *filename* to *dirs* by creating hardlinks.\n\n    Create destination directories if they don't exist.\n    \"\"\"\n    for dirname in dirs:\n        os.makedirs(dirname, exist_ok=True)\n        dest_filename = os.path.join(dirname, os.path.basename(filename))\n        os.link(filename, dest_filename)  # create hardlink\n    if dirs:  # created at least one new link\n        os.unlink(filename)  # remove old\n\n\nif len(sys.argv) < 2:\n    sys.exit(__doc__)  # print usage\n\ncommand = ['exiftool', '-json'] + ['-' + t for t in TAGNAMES] + sys.argv[1:]\ntry:\n    process = Popen(command, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, universal_newlines=True)\nexcept OSError as e:\n    sys.exit(\"error: can't start exiftool: \" + str(e))\nelse:\n    output, errors = process.communicate()\n    if process.returncode != 0:\n        sys.exit(\"error: can't read tags info: exiftool exit code: %d: %s\" % (\n            process.returncode, errors))\n\nfor metadata in json.loads(output):\n    # get first available tags list\n    dirs = next(filter(None, map(metadata.get, TAGNAMES)), [])\n    if isinstance(dirs, str):  # single tag\n        dirs = [dirs]\n    try:\n        move_to_dirs(metadata['SourceFile'], dirs)\n    except OSError as e:\n        print(\"warning: failed to move %s to %s: %s\" % (\n            metadata['SourceFile'], dirs, e), file=sys.stderr)\n\nSave it to a file named move-to-tag-dirs somewhere in $PATH.

I've tried the steps from the ubuntu 16.04 wiki, but the sudo pm-hibernate terminal command did nothing and creating the /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla file with these contents also had had no effect:\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower] Identity=unix-user:* Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate ResultActive=yes\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind] Identity=unix-user:* Action=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions ResultActive=yes\n\nI have 5.8GiB ram, 7.5GiB swap partition, and suspending to ram works fine.\n\nA: This is probably due to changes & regressions introduced in the 4.4.0 kernel such as this with Ubuntu 16.04, but I do have a workaround for 4.4.0:\nI first added my swap partition to grub, rebooted, and there was no change. Next I installed the Ubuntu kernel packages with TuxOnIce stable and the option to hibernate appeared, but that failed. I later I installed the package hibernate which uses uswsusp for suspending to disk & ram and that worked. Below are the exact steps to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double check if your swap partition/file(s) are setup correctly in /etc/default/grub; you can do so by checking the location with either cat /proc/swaps or swapon -s.\nBetter yet, find out the UUID or label of the swap partition/files(s) and use that:\ntail -n -9 /proc/swaps | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs sudo blkid\n\n\n*Edit /etc/default/grub by finding the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=, add your swap device(s), and save.

But there is a problem with the vim launcher, reproduced easily as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click a file and Open With > Vim (not Gvim!)... vim runs on your file in a terminal.\n\n*Make some changes, but don't save them.\n\n*Close the window from the title bar, as you would close gvim or any other app with pending changes.\n\n*The changes are lost, since the vim process dies along with the terminal (leaving a swapfile)\n\n\nI'd like to find a best-practice way of fixing the vim.desktop file (system version in /usr/share/applications) to make the vim launcher a viable alternative to gvim, since that default launcher is like an accident waiting to happen.\nThe option Terminal=true seems like a given, but Exec=vim %F is vulnerable to the window dying and therefore should be replaced with a wrapper script... but I need advice on\n\n\n*\n\n*how that wrapper might handle the signal of the parent terminal dying\n\n*how to handle the dialogue with the user about saving the file\n\n\nIt seems to me like the second of these tasks is impossible, since you'd have to do IPC with the vim session itself to demand the file be saved or abandoned, according to the user's choice... but I thought I'd ask here before giving up.\nI already know gvim is a workaround but that wouldn't be an answer to the question itself.  I am just surprised that this weak vim launcher is provided with Ubuntu & other distros when it invites catastrophe into the editing process.\n\nA: The answer lay in pursuing my inclination that a wrapper script was needed, with that script providing the means to run an interactive subshell (-i option to bash):\n/usr/local/bin/vim-gnome-wrap\n#!/bin/bash -f\nbash -ic 'vim \"$@\"' vim \"$@\"\n\n... then edit /usr/share/applications/vim.desktop or copy it to a new *.desktop file, with these changes:\nTryExec=vim-gnome-wrap\nTerminal=false\nExec=gnome-terminal -e \"vim-gnome-wrap %F\"\n\nThanks to @muru for pointing out the other thread Unix & Linux: Terminal and Vim, where for the sake of the larger community I have provided a more detailed answer.\n\nA: This problem has been discussed on Unix & Linux. Quite simply, there's no real way to do this. The simplest workaround is to run Vim in screen or tmux.

If you're using an AMD GPU, please read the following.\nAt this point in time, fglrx is not supported and I don't know if it will come back in the future. What this means for people using AMD GPUs is that we'll be using the open source drivers.\nRun the following command in the terminal to list your PCI devices:\nlspci \n\nThis will spit out many lines among which you should see one that is similar to this one:\n7:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Tahiti XT [Radeon HD 7970/8970 OEM / R9 280X]\n\nThe purpose of that is to find out your GPU model, which is something you should know. The next command spits out a ton of information and is something that you should never forget. If you look through it, you'll see why.\nman radeon\n\nGo all the way to the bottom of your terminal and you will see something like the following:\nX Version 11            xf86-video-ati 7.7.0 \n\nThis is the open source AMD driver, and it's active. \nThe overall point of this specific answer is to inform people that by default you should have the open source driver installed and activated on your system for your AMD GPU.

The Fn keys dosen't work!\nHowever, after upgrade, when I was configuring, I want install drivers from console: \nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-updates \n\"fglrx\" and \"fglrx-updates\" has no candidates\n\nIn the version Willy (and previous versions), I can't control or lower the brightness/backlight util the property drivers have been instaled. \nIn Ubuntu 16.04, the drivers are: \nxserver-xorg-video-amdgpu\nxserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nAnd These are open drivers, but this is not the trouble really. \nI've tried the following procedures:\nI tried to put various links, but the newbies can't post more 2 links\nAbstract:\n1. Can't change backlight level by installing driver.\n    sudo apt-get install xserver-org-video-amdgpu\n    sudo apt-get install xserver-org-video-radeon\n\n##2. It persist high shine, despite modifing /sys/class/backlight, and the promp shows me (radeon_bl0 is present):\n    lspci | grep ati\n    00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

But It dosen't work, the backlight don't change. \n9. Using xrandr\n       Finally I put in the console:\nxrandr --output LVDS-1 --brightness 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.3\nPreviously identified output \n\nThis \"worked\" for me, but when I restart the values of xrandr going to default, by more than I put xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 0.5 at start session. (On Kde by the System Settings>Start and Shutdown) \nConclussion\nIn all cases, the brightness/backlight ever is high, it dosen't matter I do, the Fn Keys don't work, and the Kde Indicator for brightness goes to 0 and the LCD looks the Christmas tree because it's turn up/down infinitely. \nAnyone have more ideas?\nSorry for my bad english!\n\nA: There's something very odd about the syntax you're using to write to the files in /sys/class/backlight/. Please try this, instead:\necho 128 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\n\nBy the way, you were not able to modify \"max_brightness\" because that file is just there to let you know the maximum brightness you can use. You need to change the file named \"brightness\".\nAbout your shell syntax: The shell redirection operator > only works if you're already running a shell as root (for example, using sudo -s), but I should let you know that doing so is generally considered a bad idea. Logging in to a root shell gives you great power; and with great power comes great whopping mistakes. It's easy to forget you're running as root and then accidentally mess up your whole system. That's why I recommend sudo, as in the example above. Sudo is a reminder to be careful: anything after the word sudo is normally off-limits and potentially dangerous.\nHowever, if you are curious, it is possible to use the > file\nredirection operator the way you were asking, but you'd need to change\nthe arguments around. The part that comes after the > is the\nfilename to write to, the part before it is the command whose output\nyou want to redirect. So, for example,\n$ sudo -s\n# cd /sys/class/backlight/*/\n# echo 128\n128\n# echo 100 > brightness\n# cat brightness\n100\n# echo 200 > brightness\n# cat max_brightness\n255\n# cat max_brightness > brightness\n# cat brightness\n255\n# exit\n$ \n\n(You'll notice your prompt changes to a hash mark when you're running a\nroot shell. That's a subtle warning sign. Typing exit will get you\nback to the safety of your normal user account.)\n\nA: there is no standard brightness level resolution in universal implementation. For example one of my linux boxes is a Toshiba Satellite L510 and has an 8 bit resolution. i.e. my /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightnesswill only accept values in [0,7]. I also have seen one other system has a resolution of 23 bits. i.e. [0-22]. \nTo know the range of brightness values, read your /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/max_brightness file. Also the value of the max_brightness file is most likely set by your system's firmware and you can not write to it. But the /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness file can be written to as long as the value being written is between 0 and the result of \ncat /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/max_brightness\nalso suspending your system and waking it up usually fixes some problems with regard to ACPI and UEFI - by extension functions keys. to suspend your system use the following command.\nsudo pm-suspend \nthen wake your system by pressing the power button and check is the function keys are working.\n", "Q: I cannot update my computer with the GUI updater due failure of internet I opened the GUI update manager to update.

I setup Windows 7 (since it actually has driver support from dell), and was able to crank back up the brightness.  When rebooting into linux, keyboard backlighting goes away again.  This has not occurred in Debian Testing (Stretch) nor Linux Mint 17.3 (14.04 based).  Additionally I do not recall the issue occurring in Gnome-Ubuntu 15.10 or 14.04.\nRandom googling brought me to \"xset led 3\" but I am pretty sure that did nothing :D\nThanks,\nJason\n\nA: It appears there was something wrong with the installation.

If I press ctrl+mouse click on a function, I come to the declaration. But how to I navigate back? On Windows I think it was ctrl+l. \n\nA: In CLion v2016.1.1, when you ctrl+mouse-click on a function it will open a new tab in which you can find the function declaration (this works if function usage and declaration/definition are in differents file).\nTo come back you only have to close the tab.\nInstead, if you want to come back to a previous view in the same file you can select from menu Navigate > Back.\nThere is also a shortcut ctrl+alt+← (left), but there is problem with it: it won't work because it is  caught by Unity when you want to change a workspace. If you want to use a shortcut you can change the keybinding in CLion preferences. To do so follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open keymap preference: from menu select Edit > Settings... > Keymap\n\n*Look for back in the search bar.\n\n*Watch at results and on Navigate entry right-click and choose Add Keyboard Shortcut\n\n*Fill the new window with your preferred shortcut and select OK\nNow you should be able to use the shortcut to come back to a previous view.\nI hope this could help you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 repeats keys without holding down any key I've got a strange bug on Ubuntu 16.04. I am sort of a new user to Ubuntu so I don't know how to troubleshoot this problem myself and it is very annoying. The problem is that every now and again Ubuntu acts as if I am holding down the \"5\" key and keeps on repeating the number until I stop it by pressing any other key. That solves the problem until the next time. I am using the Logitech Wireless K520 keyboard. \nWhat I've tried so far\n\n\n*\n\n*In Settings I've ticked off the \"Key presses repeat when key is held down\".

Add that it affects you on the launchpad page if you wish.\nSo first - how to install things?\nMethod 1 - alternative GUI\nGDebi is a package installer like the software centre, except it only handles DEB files - it's not an app store.\nYou can install GDebi with the software centre as it is in the repositories, or with sudo apt-get install gdebi.\nNext, download your DEB file.\nThen, to install the package, open GDebi and click File -> Open and navigate to the downloaded DEB file.\n\nIt can take a while to add the open the package - it took around 10 seconds for me.\nThen check everything is OK, and click install.\n\nIt will finish, and the program will be installed.\n\nMethod 2 - command line\nWhile apt-get cannot install from a DEB file, all apt-get does is download the file and then call dpkg. We can do those tasks ourselves really simply.\nFirst, we download the file.\n\nThen we open a terminal and navigate to our download location.\n\nAnd run the command:\nsudo dpkg -i FileName.deb\n\nreplacing FileName with the name of the file.\n\nFinally, run this:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nThis \"fixes\" everything - it resolves all dependencies etc.\n", "Q: network manager icon on 16.04 is not showing After installing 16.04 network manager icon no longer shows.

Most of the contents is 755 though.\nIs this a problem?\n\nA: No.  It's not safe for / (the root directory) to have 777 permissions.  That means rwxrwxrwx, i.e., every user has write permission to the root directory.\nWith that permission, every user will be able to create new subdirectories, delete existing subdirectories, and replace existing subdirectories.  For instance, a malicious user could delete /bin (by renaming it to /bin.old) and create a new /bin owned by them, containing malicious executables.  Or the user could delete /etc (by renaming it to /etc.old) and create a new /etc containing a new /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file that lets the user log in to every account on the system.\n\nA: / should not be world-writeable\n/ being world-writeable can be a huge problem. Having write permissions on /, any user can move/rename any file or directory in /. This means that any user can replace /etc, /usr or any of the other directories in / with directories of their choosing. \nDenial of Service: Trivial\nAny user can trivially DoS your system, by renaming /etc and /usr.\nPrivilege Escalation: Slightly less trivial\nIt's slightly harder to perform privilege escalation. A user can replace /bin with their own copy, and any process which then tries to use cp, or even start a shell, will be immediately at their mercy. All the user need do is wait for a process running as root to use any command in /bin, or the root user to use login, and they're in.\nExample\nbash.c:\n#include<sys/types.h>\n#include<unistd.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char*argv[], char *env[])\n{\n    if (getuid() == 0) {\n        system(\"/home/muru/foo\");\n    }\n    execve(\"/bin/bash\", argv, env); \n}\n\nfoo:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nmv /bin /..bin\nmv /.bin /bin\nrm -rf /..bin\ncp /bin/bash /home/muru\nchown root:root /home/muru/bash\nchmod u+s /home/muru/bash\n\nAnd then:\n$ gcc -o bash bash.c\n$ mkdir /..bin\n$ cd /bin; for i in /bin/*; do ln -s /..bin/\"$i\" /.bin/\"$i\"; done\n$ mv /bin /.bin\n$ mv /..bin /bin\n$ cp bash /bin\n\nAnd the next time root starts a shell, you get a setuid executable in your home directory which you can then comfortably use to gain root whenever you feel like it, without leaving much trace.\n\nA: That is interesting that the / actually allows 777 permissions to be set on it.  The / folder should not have 777 permissions, as this means that any user logged into the system can create files and folders at the / root level.  I have tested this in a VM and you CANNOT delete any of the folders or files that are not 777 without being sudo, root or the owner.  The access permissions are still followed, like trying to access the /root folder itself would give you permission denied. However, that being said, you could still move the /root folder to /root.old creating little havoc.\nTo fix this you can run sudo chmod 755 / to change permissions to what they should be.  You can also run sudo chown root:root / just to make sure that it is owned by root itself.  DO NOT run any of those commands with -R as this will change all files and folders in the partition to match permissions and ownership.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: My ubuntu 16.04 reboots by itself I've just installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my computer and now I'm experiencing that my computer reboots every few hours by itself.\nWhat is the cause of this and how can I fix this?\n\nA: it does a restart every now and then.

I have tried many things, since in the beginning I needed CDT as well. Right now, I just want to remove everything related to eclipse and do a fresh install (remove all the configs and dependencies).

I thought it had frozen but in fact it was running very, very slowly. The problem is the version of GTK+ 3, shipped with 16.04. Fortunately the solution is very easy. Open a terminal and then type export SWT_GTK3=0, then start Eclipse from the terminal. If that works, then a more persistent fix is to put the 2 lines below, as they appear in your eclipse.ini:\n--launcher.GTK_version\n2\n\nbefore the line:\n--launcher.appendVmargs\n\nThe bug is filed with Ubuntu at bug 1552764\n\nA: My recomendation is that you install Eclipse Mars from the webpage:\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index-developer.php?release=mars\nBut first you have to install java8 (not java9 because Eclipse Mars doesn't work with that version). In Ubuntu you can do this with:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk\nAnd then .. and just if you have other java version, you have to select java8 with this command:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nVoilà! That worked for me! :)\n\nA: By starting the application from the command line (the terminal) it is sometimes possible to get more information about why the program fails to start.

Program will exit.\n\nIn this case it looks like the line\n-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n\nin the file eclipse.ini is the problem. Simply remove that line (create a backup of the eclipse.ini file first) and try to start the program again.\nAbove solution worked on Eclipse Version: Mars.2 Release (4.5.2) on a machine upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04\n\nA: Apparently this is a known bug in Ubuntu 16.04. This affects not only eclipse but several other applications too.\nBefore the fix is released here is a quick fix that works. Open terminal and type \n$ initctl restart unity-panel-service\n\nThis will bring back the Menus for the current session.

After upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04, in startup it shows\n/dev/sda1: clean, 291272/4292608 files, 480345/18174432 blocks\n\nwhich makes Ubuntu take some time to load.\n\nA: Same problem here. I thought this problem was due to the changes that I made in the secure boot settings (UEFI) in the upgrade process of my dual boot laptop (ubuntu and windows).\nAfter browsing some forums and comments section, I finally found the solution (for my laptop at least, I dont know if this works for everybody)\nOpen terminal at log-in screen (ctrl+alt+F2)\nafter logging-in, run\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nA: /dev/sda1: clean, 291272/4292608 files, 480345/18174432 is output from a fsck check.\nIn the /etc/fstab file you probably have a line that looks like this:\n/dev/sda1 / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nAccording to the fstab information the 1 on the end of the line is the pass number.  The definition to that is:\n\nControls the order in which fsck checks the device/partition for\n  errors at boot time. The root device should be 1. Other partitions\n  should be 2, or 0 to disable checking.\n\nWhich will make the system check the / root partition with fsck during boot time for errors and correct them if any are found. This can cause a slow down during the system boot for the check.  This should not run every boot up as I believe that there is a flag to let it know if it needs to run or not.\n\nSome observations I have found from upgrading and clean installing Ubuntu 16.04:\nClean install of Ubuntu 16.04 has defaulted to LVM partitioning scheme.  This has created an ext2 root partition that gets checked with the fsck command on every single boot.\nUpgrade install over an old Ubuntu 14.04 installation keeping the drive at ext4 has not caused the host to run fsck at every boot.\nIt appears to me that having the ext2 format on the root partition causes fsck to run at every boot.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Same problem here!

Some people found also that the line containing \"remote SERVER NNNN\" should be split into \"remote SERVER\" and \"port NNNN\".\n\nA: The issue for me was the following line in my .ovpn file:\nroute remote_host 255.255.255.255 net_gateway\n\nCommenting out this line allowed me to import the connection.\n\nA: My setup\nI also had the same issue, trying to import on an Ubuntu 16.04 client a .ovpn file produced by a home pritunl server. \nThe .ovpn file contained comment lines (#) as well as inline certificates (<ca>, <tls-auth>, <cert>, <key>). And there was no apparent reason to remove comments or keys. This same .ovpn had already been successfully imported into the Kubuntu 16.04 network manager, with only a warning about reneg-sec being too high; A clue to import issues on Ubuntu 16.04.\nSolving the OP's errors\n\n\n*\n\n*The reneg-sec value is too high and encounters known import bug:\nreneg-sec 2592000\n\nComment it out or use default value 3600.\n#reneg-sec 2592000\n\nThis value can be re-set from Advanced settings in VPN config tab under:\n\n\n*The config had two remote definitions:\nremote hostname.org 14195 udp6\nremote hostname.org 14195 udp\nremote-random\n\nTry with only one:\n#remote hostname.org 14195 udp6\nremote hostname.org 14195 udp\n#remote-random\n\nAfter these two modifications, there were no import errors. \nFurther issue with remote configuration\nAlthough there was no import error any more, the remote was not imported properly, i.e. the port and protocol were not properly parsed, so I had to further break the remote directive down in the .ovpn file as follows\n    remote hostname.org\n    port 14195\n    proto udp\n\nSummary\nMy .ovpn file contained comments as well as inline certificates, etc.. After reading some other posts, I thought the problem lied in the inline files or the comments, so I split the inline certificates and keys into separate files and removed all comments.\nSo in the end, after applying the above fixes, the .ovpn file with the inline keys and comments was imported.\n\nA: Edit *.ovpn file\nProbably this is caused by settings in the .opvn file that can't be parsed.\nFirst make sure you have the needed packages installed:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn-gnome network-manager-openvpn openvpn\n\nIf it still fails, edit the *.ovpn file in a text editor and strip out the following lines that break the import.\n<he> tag\nIf there is a <he> tag in the client ovpn config files, delete those lines.  It's not needed:\n<he>\n...\n</he>\n\nMultiple connection details\nIf there is something like:\n<connection>\nremote <ip> 443 tcp-client\n</connection\n<connection>\nremote <ip> 1194 udp\n</connection>\n\nReplace that section with this:\nremote <ip> 1194 udp\n\nThe import stumbles upon multiple connections and doesn't support the <connection> tag. At least not in 16.04-17.04.\nThat's all, IMHO you can keep comments, they make no difference.\nAfter you deleted the  tag and edited the connection part, try to import the modified *.ovpn file. Solution from this blog post.\n\nA: I also have Ubuntu 16.04, and the same problem occurs.\nThe solution is not a very good solution, because you need another computer already connected with the VPN.\nCheck that you have already installed openvpn and network-manager, from the terminal:\n$ sudo apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n$ sudo systemctl restart network-manager\n\nIn general, this should work, but in very few cases (and i don't know why - i suppose that's probably a bug) a .ovpn can't be imported.\nSo, follow theses steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the computer that already have a created connection with the VPN, select the vpn connection \n\n*make empty the password\n\n*click on export button\nAt this point, you'd have a \".conf\" file.\n\n\n*open the \".conf\" file and edit any parts that reference files on your computer if exists\n\n*In your computer, create a new connection with the \".conf\" file.\n\nA: For me, I had to change the following in the .ovpn file:\nremote ***.org 443 tcp-client\n\nTo:\nproto tcp\nremote ***.org 443\n\nAnd also, as pointed by @Kostas Filios I had to change this part to a comment:\n#reneg-sec 2592000\n\n\nA: I had this problem while importing the .ovpn file with the network manager.\nI fixed it by changing my remote line from\nremote vpn.example.com 1190 udp4\nto\nremote vpn.example.com 1190 udp\n\nA: I had the same problem on a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 install. To my surprise openVPN was NOT installed by default. \nI figured out because when I clicked \"+\" sign in \"setting->Network->VPN\"section the dialogue box did only had two option i.e. Open VPN option was not there. \nI followed 1 and installed openvpn and restarted network manager everything worked fine after that as I can see the OpenVPN option on the popup image attached\nsudo apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome\nsudo systemctl restart network-manager\n\nJoao Paulo's advice \n\nA: I needed to replace the line remote xx.xx.xx.xx 443 tcp4 with remote xx.xx.xx.xx 443 tcp for it to work.\n", "Q: Running on an i3-6100U in an HP Pavillon with switchable graphics I'm trying to see how well I can get Kubuntu 14.04 to run on my wife's HP Pavillon with its i3-6100U CPU and additiona Topaz XT [Radeon R7 M260/M265] (rev 81) discrete graphics.\nIt runs OK enough with the provided generic Xenial LT kernel (4.4.0.18 at the moment, I think), even from an external HDD in a USB3 enclosure (actually the internal disk fro the previous laptop).

Pity that there are no lts-xenial packages for XOrg but this  seems to work just fine too.\nXOrg now opts to use the HD520 graphics, probably because support for the R7 is incomplete.

In Ubuntu download page I found 64-bit ISO image as ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso, I am bit confused because it mentioned amd64.\nCan this image ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso can be run on intel 64-bit processors?\n\nA: amd64 is the one you want. It works for both Intel and AMD x86-64 processors.\nThe reason it's named amd64 is because Intel created a 64-bit processor line called Itanium that wasn't based on x86, and it didn't do very well. AMD decided instead to base their 64-bit chips on x86, so the name amd64 was initially used in certain areas like Linux processor type names, and it stuck.\n\nA: amd64 is the x86 instruction set, so it's Intel as well as AMD. It's also sometimes called x86-64 or x64.\nSo yes, amd64.iso can run on Intel 64-bit processors, just as i386 works on 32-bit ones.\n", "Q: How to install additional packages that had ignored by --no-install-recommends flag? --install-suggests is not a solution - it offers install suggested packages for all installed in system packages - I want to install recommends only for one particular package.\nP.S.

The system is completely unresponsive, only a force shutdown works at this point.\nInterestingly, i can't correlate this freeze with any specific program or application, as the system hangs sometimes even while doing the simplest operations like opening the Terminal, or the Unity search. \nI would be interested if there is any log saved that could contain useful information on these hangs.\nThank you.\n\nA: I was facing a similar problem on my Ubuntu 16.04.

I allocated swap space for Ubuntu and guess what, the problem is gone! Hope this helps. :)\nEdit: I was wrong! This problem was not solved and it has nothing to do with swap memory, though allocating swap memory apparently fixed another type of freeze where continuous hard disk access occurs during the freeze and where it is possible to kill the latest process forcefully (by typing alt+sysrq+F from keyboard) to recover from the freeze.\nHowever, this problem(where nothing but forced shutdown works to recover from the freeze) may be related to the kernel and if kernel upgrading cannot solve the problem, then a workaround could be to add the statement intel_idle.max_cstate=1 in the grub configuration file:\nSTEPS\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n*There is a line in that: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" (like this), replace with: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_idle.max_cstate=1\"\n\n*Save it (CTRL+O)\n\n*sudo update-grub\n\n*sudo reboot\nI will try this if I face the problem again(since in my case this problem is very rare now, occurred only once within a week after swap allocation, which led to the confusion), but there are people who have solved this kind of problem by this workaround.\nLate update:\nActually, I tried the above-mentioned workaround a couple of weeks after posting the Edit (most probably because the problem reappeared again, but it was not frequent for sure).

I followed the steps at http://sourcedigit.com/19889-how-to-update-install-linux-kernel-4-7-rc3-on-ubuntu-16-04/ to upgrade the kernel then downloaded the missing firmware. Full steps detailed below.\nDownload the necessary files:\nwget kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.7-rc3-yakkety/linux-headers-4.7.0-040700rc3_4.7.0-040700rc3.201606121131_all.deb \nwget kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.7-rc3-yakkety/linux-headers-4.7.0-040700rc3-generic_4.7.0-040700rc3.201606121131_i386.deb \nwget kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.7-rc3-yakkety/linux-image-4.7.0-040700rc3-generic_4.7.0-040700rc3.201606121131_i386.deb\n\nOnce the files have downloaded, install them with dpkg:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-4.7*.deb linux-image-4.7*.deb\n\nLook out for warnings in the output. I came across the warning: W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/skl_guc_ver6.bin for module i915\nDownload this missing module and copy it to the stated folder:\nwget https://ftp2.halpanet.org/source/_dev/linux-firmware.git/i915/skl_guc_ver6.bin\nsudo cp skl_guc_ver6.bin /lib/firmware/i915/\n\nIt might not be necessary, but I reinstalled the v4.7 Kernel after copying the module, this time the warning did not come up:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-4.7*.deb linux-image-4.7*.deb\n\nOnce reinstalled, update GRUB and reboot:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter this my Ubuntu 16.04 install has been running smoothly on the 4.7RC3 kernel.\n", "Q: How can I downgrade from PHP 7 to PHP 5.6 on Ubuntu 16.04?

You can proceed as follows:\nsudo apt-get purge php7.*\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install php5.6\n\nYou can then check the version of your php to be sure. It is done as seen below:\nphp -v\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 comes with php 7.0, and some php applications might still fail with php 7.0 .Therefore, in some cases, it might be sensible to have both php 7.0 and php 5.x, so that you can choose which version to use for your needs at any time.\nYou can do so with:\nxavi@computer# sudo su\nroot@computer# add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\nroot@computer# apt-get update\nroot@computer# apt-get install php7.0 php5.6 php5.6-mysql php-gettext php5.6-mbstring php-xdebug libapache2-mod-php5.6 libapache2-mod-php7.0 php5.6-curl php5.6-gd php5.6-mcrypt php5.6-xml php5.6-xmlrpc\n\nInstalling both php5.6 & php7.0 was clean in my case: no complain of issues, etc.\nTo switch from php 5.6 to php 7.0 you need to do two things:\n# For php in web apps\nsudo a2dismod php5.6 && sudo a2enmod php7.0 && sudo service apache2 restart\n# For php-cli in the command line\nsudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/php7.0 /etc/alternatives/php\n\nor from php7.0 to php5.6:\n# For php in web apps\nsudo a2dismod php7.0 && sudo a2enmod php5.6 && sudo service apache2 restart\n# For php-cli in the command line\nsudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/php5.6 /etc/alternatives/php\n\nYou can also quickly check which yours is using by running php -v.\n\nA: Update\nToday I got again problem with PHP 7 running despite I have disabled php7.0 apache module: phpinfo was showing php 7 using fastCGI ...\n... So if after you follow the below instructions you face this situation, you may need to disable the proxy_fcgi apache module:\nsudo a2dismod proxy_fcgi proxy; sudo service apache2 restart\n\n1. Re-Install PHP 5.6 \nWhat worked for me was this guide: http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2016/php-7-0-and-5-6-on-ubuntu\nActually is not required to remove php7.0, you can install php5.6 together  ( also because you will have dependency problem with phpmyadmin package that required php7.0)\nAssuming libapache2-mod-php is a suitable way to enable PHP in Apache for you, you can proceed in this way:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install php7.0 php5.6 php5.6-mysql php-gettext php5.6-mbstring php-mbstring php7.0-mbstring php-xdebug libapache2-mod-php5.6 libapache2-mod-php7.0\n\n2. Switch PHP version:\n\n\n*\n\n*From php5.6 to php7.0:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Apache:   \nsudo a2dismod php5.6 ; sudo a2enmod php7.0 ; sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n*CLI:     \nsudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.0\n\n\n\n*From php7.0 to php5.6:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Apache:  \nsudo a2dismod php7.0 ; sudo a2enmod php5.6 ; sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n*CLI:  \nsudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php5.6\n\n\nA: Your question lacks important details, so I will answer more broadly.\nAssuming you are using packages, there are some important details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache2 can be configured to use either apache2 SAPI using libapache2-mod-php7.0 package or FPM SAPI using php7.0-fpm with mod_proxy_fcgi.\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04 has only PHP 7.0 in the repositories, you can use ppa:ondrej/php to add support for PHP 5.6 using similar naming scheme (e.g. libapache2-mod-php5.6 or php5.6-fpm).\n\n*If you are using Apache2 SAPI (libapache2-mod-php*), you need to disable PHP 7.0 after you install libapache2-mod-php5.6 by running a2dismod php7.0 and enable PHP 5.6 by running a2enmod php5.6.\n\n*If you are using FPM SAPI (php*-fpm) then you need to change FPM unix socket from /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock to /run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock.\n\n*Please remember that for modules bundled with PHP (like MySQL) the naming convention is phpX.Y-<ext> (f.e. php7.0-mysql and php5.6-mysql), but for external PECL modules (f.e. APCu, mongodb, ...) it's just php-<ext> (f.e. php-apcu, php-mongodb).  I recommend running apt-cache search php <ext> on your system to search for correct package name before asking a questions on the Internet.\n", "Q: Can I run a small web server from a custom directory? The question may not be clear, let me explain:\nI develop websites using Symfony and there is a clever little command that allows me to start an apache server, taking the root of the server as the current directory.

I would like to test something that doesn't require that PHP framework.\nI know I could simply make a symlink to my actual Apache server (/var/www if I remember correctly, it has been a long time since I used that one). It's not that I'm stuck, I was just wondering if it was doable without too much tears.\n\nA: As I understand , You want to start php built-in server so you can easily do that: \n cd /path/to/your/app\n php -S localhost:8000\n\nAs output you'll get :\nListening on localhost:8000\nDocument root is /path/to/your/app\n\n\nA: i think Symfony doesn't use apache server .it uses internal php server as php after php 5.4 have internal small server for development you can start it using simple command \nphp [options] -S addr:port [-t docroot]\n\nex:\n php -S localhost:8000 -t .\n\nto start server listening on port 8000 and doc root for it is the current dir \nif you want to use apache server you can make symbolic link to you app dir in apache document root dir   or setup apache virtual host  \n", "Q: how to replace 3rd row in a file using sed?

But it is much easier to manage a CLI only VM by connecting to it via ssh instead of the console window provided by Virtualbox.\nAnd you can resize the terminal as much as you like and of course you can copy/paste there too.\nIf the virtual NIC is configured for NAT you will have to tell VBox (in the advanced network settings) to create port forwarding.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install the .snap application in an offline computer? In DEB package, it is not possible to install an application in offline (in a computer which does not have any internet access). Because of the dependencies. In case of .snap, according to the OMG!Ubuntu, Snap packages can contain both application binary and any dependencies required for it to run. \nDoes it mean that, any .snap application can be installed in an offline pc (like the .dmg in MacOSX)? As there is no need to fetch any dependencies from the source. \n\nA: First of all, you can indeed install debs offline:\n$ sudo dpkg -i <deb>\n\nHowever, you're right in that it doesn't take into account the deb's dependencies-- you actually need to have the deb and all its dependencies available offline in order to successfully install it:\n$ sudo dpkg -i <deb> <dependency1> <dependency2> ...\n\nSo yes, installing a snap offline is very easy, and all you need to have is that single snap (since as you know, it includes its dependencies):\n$ sudo snap install path/to/snap\n\n\nA: It seems you first have to download and install the ubuntu-core snap before you can do offline installs for any other snaps. For me this worked:\nRun the following commands on an online Ubuntu system:\n\nsnap download ubuntu-core\nsnap download somePackage\n\nThis will put the following files in your current directory:\n\nubuntu-core_1797.assert\nubuntu-core_1797.snap\nsomePackage.assert\nsomePackage.snap\n\nCopy these files to the offline system, then install them (from the directory they were copied to):\n\nsudo snap ack ubuntu-core_1797.assert\nsudo snap install ubuntu-core_1797.snap\nsudo snap ack somePackage.assert\nsudo snap install somePackage.snap\n\nThis should solve the problem @lane had where it tried to connect to the internet while installing a local .snap file.\n", "Q: gnome-software on Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't work After plain installation of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS gnome-software doesn't work.\nIt has opened once with GUI, but installation of Unity Tweak Tool didn't finish.\nWhen starting again, GUI doesn't come up.\nWhen opening from terminal, a warning appears, but the application GUI doesn't open.\n$ gnome-software\n(gnome-software:7052): Gs-WARNING: failed to open plugin /usr/lib/gs-plugins-9/libgs_plugin_xdg_app_reviews.so: /usr/lib/gs-plugins-9/libgs_plugin_xdg_app_reviews.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nDoes anybody have same experience, and eventually, a solution?\n\nAccording to the recommendation:\n$ dpkg-query -S /usr/lib/gs-plugins-9/libgs_plugin_xdg_app_reviews.so\ngnome-software: /usr/lib/gs-plugins-9/libgs_plugin_xdg_app_reviews.so\n\nProposed reinstall of gnome-software did not help.\n\nAs workaround, use Synaptic Package manager and command line.\n\nA: Seen this fix going around, it worked for me:\nsudo apt-get autoremove gnome-software\nsudo apt-get install gnome-software\n\nIt appears if you just reinstall gnome-software it just works!\n\nA: Perform these steps to Fix gnome-software/ubuntu-software\nRename or remove the ~/.local/share/gnome-software.

Both were using the same tracker and only 16.04.2 had this error message, 16.04.3 was fine.\nSo it seems this is the way tracker is letting the users know this version is not the most recent one and they should neither download nor seed them anymore and should rather look for current version torrent.

Suppose that I crashed my system during upgrade.\ndoes Ubuntu installation can detect and fix previously installed system?\n\nA: If you are able to boot, Ubuntu may or may not be able to solve the problem itself, often you yourself need to go investigate. For example:\nDuring the distro upgrade I left my pc for around two hours, then came back with a black screen. I pushed the reset button and ubuntu booted, only showing up several services active. Using CTRL + ALT + F2 I was able to turn the screen in a terminal, logging in with password and username. Then I did apt-get update and apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. This then continued to update / install packages.\nSo short answer: Maybe. However, if you ever get stuck on something and don't know how to fix it yourself, you can always ask on this site and volunteers will help you with your problem.\n\nA: Reinstall Ubuntu While Keeping Files and Programs\nif there’s a problem with your installed Ubuntu system, you should still be able to boot up an Ubuntu live CD or USB drive. Boot to the live media and start installing Ubuntu. Ubuntu should find your existing installation and give you a “Reinstall Ubuntu” option. When you perform a reinstall, the installer will keep all your personal files and settings. It will even keep your installed software packages, if possible. The Reinstall option will wipe away all your system-wide settings and return them to their defaults, but that should fix problems that misconfigured system settings could cause.\nSelect this option and continue through the process to reinstall Ubuntu on your computer. The installation process will also reinstall the GRUB2 boot loader along with Ubuntu, so it will also fix any GRUB issues.\n\nIf you’re worried about losing your files, it’s always a good idea to have backups. You can use the “Try Ubuntu” option on the Ubuntu installation media to access a graphical desktop. From here, open the file manager and access the files stored on your Ubuntu system drive. Connect some sort of external storage — such as a USB flash drive or external hard drive — to the computer and use the graphical file manager to back up your files.\nYou’ll find the Ubuntu drive under Devices in the sidebar. You’ll find your personal files in your /home/NAME directory for. Be sure to remember your hidden configuration files if you want to back those up, too.\nIn theory, this shouldn’t be necessary — the Reinstall option shouldn’t erase your files. However, it’s always a good idea to have backup copies of your files. if you don’t, it’s probably a good idea to create that backup before doing anything else. Something could always go wrong.\n", "Q: Why isn't there a useful version of GeoGebra in Ubuntu One of the great things about Ubuntu used to be that you install software from the packaging system (with apt-get or similar), not by downloading from a website.\nNow when I want recent Geogebra or google Chrome I have to do just that: Download a package from the vendor's site.\n\n*\n\n*There used to PPA's for these things that the official packagers don't want to supply, but none seem to be available. Why? What's wrong with Ubuntu?\n\n\n*Is there a clever way to update those manually installed packages?\nEdit\nThanks to the comments below I realize that\n\n*\n\n*the download packages create an entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.d pointing to the vendor's \"3rd party repository\", which allows the package to be updated automatically by the system. Clever. This works for both GeoGebra and Google Chrome.\n\n*This scheme kinda solves my problem—I only have to download the program manually once, and that's no harder than adding a PPA, so in that sense there's nothing \"wrong\" with Ubuntu\n\nThat answers both my questions. Thanks.\n\nA: Every new distribution of Ubuntu has got a new code name: take Xenial Xerus for example. If apt-get update is run, it will search through all repositories, including the ones you manually added, along with the codename xenial. If no package with the codename xenial is available, this will prompt back with 404 not found.\nThe developers for that repository simply did not optimize / put xenial in just yet.\nThere is a workaround: building from source. If you have a tarball you can extract that, and in there there should be a readme which instructs you how to build that package and install it from source. Often make is used for it. I do not reccomend building with make as it is possible that the source does not have any method to uninstall built package, unless mentioned in the readme file.\nBut yeah. Using apt-get actually retrieves the file via a website for the codename (eg. xenial), and if it is not available, you are unable to update / install the package, unless you build from source or find another method.\n", "Q: No Shadows under menus on application decoration borders and unity panel After upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 my system works well, except some minor issues with video drivers for NVIDIA at least.

The problem is to find an editor that can save the edited contents to stdout. The only editor I could find is ed which is very unfriendly to use. I would much prefer a visual editor. Is there an editor that can do this, or alternatively can decrypt and encrypt files within the editor?\n\nA: You can use vipe to edit pipelines:\nSYNOPSIS\n       command1 | vipe | command2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       vipe allows you to run your editor in the middle of a unix pipeline and\n       edit the data that is being piped between programs.

I have recently noticed that the latest version of Ubuntu does not come with the latest stable Linux kernel version.\nFor example, Kubuntu 16.04 LTS comes with Kernel 4.4.0-21-generic while the latest stable kernel version is 4.5.2.\nThere is surely a strong reason why they don't ship the OS with the latest stable kernel which is something I would like to learn about.\nI would also like to know if updating the kernel to its latest stable edition is a bad idea or not.\n\nA: Like Ubuntu, the Linux kernel also has long-term support versions. So, for an Ubuntu LTS release (like 16.04), picking the latest long-term kernel version makes sense. This way, unlike with a normal stable release, Canonical can rely on the kernel maintainers to backport fixes for a long time. 4.4 will be supported till February 2018.\nCanonical did pick a normal stable version, 3.13, for Ubuntu 14.04. This was considered a mistake. The Ubuntu community and Canonical devs had to pick up maintenance of the 3.13 kernel the same month that 14.04 released. On the other hand, 3.12 would have been supported by the kernel team until next year.\n", "Q: error in odoo on ubuntu 16.04 after running odoo server and trying to go to localhost:8069 I got error in webpage saying \"TypeError: CleanCSS is not a function\".\nI am running Odoo 9 on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\nA: I got the same problem and I found this solution from https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/9113 by daniel-adb-fa, that worked fine and easy for me (I needed sudo because I was not logged as root):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install odoo 9.0 from the nightly repo according to documentation.\n\n*Install the current versions of less and less-plugin-css via npm.

You can check out the bug that's tracking this issue: Bug #1518457: kswapd0 100% CPU usage\nThere isn't an actual fix yet, but there are a couple workarounds that may fix the problem for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches to a regular crontab and/or run that command manually when kswapd acts up\n\n*Comment out line 2 in /lib/udev/rules.d/40-vm-hotadd.rules (see the bug link for more discussion)\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 kernel 4.4.0-21 not loading nvidia/vboxdrv modules anymore (Required key not available) The latest kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 (4.4.0-21) doesn't load the nvidia (and vboxdrv) module anymore.\n$ sudo modprobe -v nvidia\ninsmod /lib/modules/4.4.0-21-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia_361.ko \nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'nvidia_361': Required key not available\n\nWith 4.4.0-18 it still works. What has changed? How do I fix the problem?\n\nA: There is a way to leave secure boot on and use proprietary kernel modules like NVidia or VirtualBox. First download xca app:\nsudo apt install xca\n\nThen create new database and generate new key. Next generate CA certificate from that private key. Export private key to PEM format and CA public cert to DER format. Import CA cert to MOK database:\nsudo mokutil --import CAcert.cer\n\nProgram asks you for password for MOK database. After reboot MOKManager will be executed before GRUB. Select Enroll keys, select cert that you add before and enter password for confirmation. After that your CA cert is added to MOK database. Reboot.\nNext find sign-file program in kernel headers scripts directory. For me it is in:\n/usr/src/linux-headers-4.4.0-22-lowlatency/scripts/sign-file\n\nNow sign all kernel modules in /lib/modules/4.4.0-22-lowlatency/updates/dkms/. For example:\n/usr/src/linux-headers-4.4.0-22-lowlatency/scripts/sign-file sha256 CA.pem CAcert.cer /lib/modules/4.4.0-22-lowlatency/updates/dkms/nvidia_361.ko\n\nAfter that you will be able to load module without Required key not available error.\nAfter install new kernel or new version of module kernels from dkms directory you must repeat signing procedure.\nLinks to read to clarify:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SecureBoot\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sect-signing-kernel-modules-for-secure-boot.html\n\nA: Kernel bug #1571691 had the answer:\nsudo apt-get install mokutil; sudo mokutil --disable-validation\n\n", "Q: Xserver Permission Denied tty7 I have a linux box with kodi and the following systemd script to start kodi at boot:\n[Unit]\nDescription = kodi-standalone using xinit\nAfter = systemd-user-sessions.service network.target sound.target network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nUser = kodi\nGroup = kodi\nType = simple\nPAMName=login\nExecStart = /usr/bin/xinit /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /usr/bin/openbox-session -- :0 -nolisten tcp vt7\nRestart = on-abort\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy = multi-user.target\n\nThis worked fine under Ubuntu 15.10 but after an upgrade this doesn't work anymore.

Debian 9 release notes about Xorg server no longer requiring root), and to switch from using plain xinit to using the startx wrapper (cf. Debian bug #801401).\nI don't know the specifics of this Kodi use case, but stumbled upon this question while researching the generic issue, so I figured I best write this up to help someone else connect the dots.\n", "Q: How to reinstall GRUB bootloader for 14.04 after upgrading to Windows 10 What do I do to reinstall the GRUB boot-loader, since I heard the Windows boot-loader overwrites GRUB.\n\nA: Boot from the live CD or live USB, in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode.\nDetermine the partition number of your main partition. GParted (which should already be installed, by default, on the live session) can help you here. I'm going to assume in this answer that it's /dev/sda2, but make sure you use the correct partition number for your system!\nMount your partition:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt  #Replace sda2 with your partition number\n\nBind mount some other necessary stuff:\n\nfor i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt$i\"; done\n\nchroot into your Ubuntu install:\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nAt this point, you're in your install, not the live session, and running as root.

Snaps.\nThere are two key points here. This paragraph from the announcement of inclusion of snaps in 16.04:\n\nDevelopers of paid apps have often been the most frustrated with\n  having to manage dependencies and compatibility with various\n  libraries, especially on older releases of Ubuntu. For this reason\n  these applications are going to be migrated from debs to snaps by\n  Autumn 2016.

Also, all files in the pen drive are read-only and it doesn't allow me to change permissions. \n\nA: Delete pendrive partition table and make new with gparted or parted. If there will be any troubles with it you can destroy actual pendrive partition table with dd command. Before this make sure with lsblk command which of your drives is your pendrive. Assuming that your pendrive is /dev/sdc (can contain partitions  sdc1, sdc2, etc...): \nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1M count=1 \n\nBe very careful, if you type wrong of device you can erase your actual hdd/ssd partition table.\nAfter making new partition table it will be necessary to format your usb to desired filesystem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Failed to created shared shared memory file: Permission denied? While installing ubuntu 16.04\nI am getting:\nFailed to create sharedmemoryfile /WK2SharedMemory.34567654: Permission denied\n\nfrom the ubuntu installer at the stage of restoring previously installed packages.\n\nA: As I wrote before in a comment: this happens when you reinstall without formatting the root partition (or partitions where the packages are stored e.g. /usr if you do such a thing). Ubiquity Installer tries to restore the previously installed packages and during that stage Webkit seems to act up. If you open a terminal and run top you will find a WebKitWebProcess consuming 100% CPU, kill it with killall WebKitWebProcess and the installation will continue. You may not be able to spawn a terminal when it already happened, instead switch to a virtual terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1 login as user ubuntu with an empty password and kill the process there, be patient, it might take some time to perform this, then switch back to the GUI Ctrl+Alt+F7 and wait for the installation to continue and complete.\nI filed a bug on Launchpad for this after some testing: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1607779\n\nIf all of this doesn't work for you and you can't get Ubuntu installed without formatting the partition, then make a list of installed packages (dpkg -l with minimal scripting and review of the output can do this for you) and compare modifications you made to /etc and other directories. This is another reason to make backups: compare what previously had after a fresh install.\n", "Q: Can't simulate middle click with my trackpad ASUS Zenbook UX305UA-FC057T When I try to simulate middle click with right+left click of the trackpad, even after ran \nsynclient TapButton3=2\n\nI can't be able to paste what I had selected previously, like the known behavior of a Linux box.\nAny idea ?\nUbuntu 16.04\nkernel 4.4.0-15-generic\nElan touchpad  \nEDIT:\nI put this in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-elan.conf :\n# This option disables software buttons on Elan touchpads.\n# This option is only interpreted by clickpads.\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Disable clickpad buttons on Elan touchpads\"\n    MatchProduct \"Elan\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger3\" \"2\"\nEndSection\n\nI get in xorg log what I expect :\n[     3.121] (II) config/udev: Adding input device Elan Touchpad (/dev/input/event6)\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: Applying InputClass \"evdev touchpad catchall\"\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: Applying InputClass \"evdev touchscreen catchall\"\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: Applying InputClass \"touchpad catchall\"\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: Applying InputClass \"Default clickpad buttons\"\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: Applying InputClass \"Disable clickpad buttons on Elan touchpads\"\n[     3.121] (II) LoadModule: \"synaptics\"\n[     3.121] (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input/synaptics_drv.so\n[     3.121] (II) Module synaptics: vendor=\"X.Org Foundation\"\n[     3.121]    compiled for 1.18.1, module version = 1.8.2\n[     3.121]    Module class: X.Org XInput Driver\n[     3.121]    ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 22.1\n[     3.121] (II) Using input driver 'synaptics' for 'Elan Touchpad'\n[     3.121] (**) Elan Touchpad: always reports core events\n[     3.121] (**) Option \"Device\" \"/dev/input/event6\"\n[     3.204] (II) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: found clickpad property\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: x-axis range 0 - 3097 (res 32)\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: y-axis range 0 - 2119 (res 33)\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: pressure range 0 - 255\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: finger width range 0 - 15\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: buttons: left double triple\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: Vendor 0x4f3 Product 0x5\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"ClickFinger1\" \"1\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"ClickFinger2\" \"3\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"ClickFinger3\" \"2\"\n[     3.204] (**) Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0\"\n[     3.204] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: touchpad found\n[     3.204] (**) Elan Touchpad: always reports core events\n[     3.240] (**) Option \"config_info\" \"udev:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.1/i2c_designware.1/i2c-5/i2c-ELAN0100:00/input/input6/event6\"\n[     3.240] (II) XINPUT: Adding extended input device \"Elan Touchpad\" (type: TOUCHPAD, id 10)\n[     3.240] (**) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: (accel) MinSpeed is now constant deceleration 2.5\n[     3.240] (**) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: (accel) MaxSpeed is now 1.75\n[     3.240] (**) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: (accel) AccelFactor is now 0.053\n[     3.240] (**) Elan Touchpad: (accel) keeping acceleration scheme 1\n[     3.240] (**) Elan Touchpad: (accel) acceleration profile 1\n[     3.240] (**) Elan Touchpad: (accel) acceleration factor: 2.000\n[     3.240] (**) Elan Touchpad: (accel) acceleration threshold: 4\n[     3.240] (--) synaptics: Elan Touchpad: touchpad found\n[     3.241] (II) config/udev: Adding input device Elan Touchpad (/dev/input/mouse0)\n[     3.241] (**) Elan Touchpad: Ignoring device from InputClass \"touchpad ignore duplicates\"\n\nbut I still can't middle paste with pushing both left+right buttons.\n\nA: I have a UX303UA, which has a FocalTech touchpad, rather than the Elan your Zenbook has. \nI solved this problem by adding a conf file to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d called 52-focaltech.conf. You would probably want to call yours 52-elan.conf or such. The 52 at the start is important because that way it runs after the system-supplied conf files for the touchpad, so it will override any settings there.\nThis file restores the normal unix meaning of the middle button and also disables all the weird 3 finger gestures. The ClickFinger option fixes the middle button and the TapButton option makes the 3 finger gestures go away. I stumbled onto this on my path to fixing the middle button and I kept it because I hate the 3 finger gestures. You can probably leave it out and still fix the middle button. I didn't try it because its getting late.\nThe content of my file is:\n# This option disables software buttons on FocalTech touchpads.\n# This option is only interpreted by clickpads.\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Disable clickpad buttons on FocalTech touchpads\"\n    MatchProduct \"FocalTech\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"ClickFinger3\" \"2\"\nEndSection\n\nYou will have to change all the instances of \"FocalTech\" to \"Elan\" in this file in order for this to work on your system.\nThe exact spelling used by the software for your Elan touchpad may be different than what the marketing material or documentation call it. To find out exactly what the software calls your device you can look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log. Search for \"Adding input device\". You can also use the xinput command to find it like this:\nbuddyp@UX303UA:/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d$ xinput\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  \\(3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Atmel                                     id=10   [slave pointer (2)]\n⎜   ↳ FocalTechPS/2 FocalTech FocalTech Touchpad    id=13   [slave pointer  (2)]\n\nInstead of FocalTech, you should see your Elan in your output.\nAfter you add your conf file to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ you will have to log out and back in again for it to take effect\nBTW, the key to solving this problem was 'man synaptics'\n", "Q: After 15.10 -> 16.04, desktop-file-utils can't be configured Yesterday's x86_64 upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04 appeared to go well, but I'm left with this situation:\n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall desktop-file-utils\nReading package lists...

It will basically save everything printed on the terminal in that script session.\nFrom man script:\nscript makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal. \nIt is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an \ninteractive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file \ncan be printed out later with lpr(1).\nYou can start a script session by just typing script in the terminal, all the subsequent commands and their outputs will all be saved in a file named typescript in the current directory. You can save the result to a different file too by just starting script like:\n\nscript output.txt\nTo logout of the script session (stop saving the contents), just type exit.\nHere is an example:\n$ script output.txt\nScript started, file is output.txt\n\n$ ls\noutput.txt  testfile.txt  foo.txt\n\n$ exit\nexit\nScript done, file is output.txt\n\nNow if I read the file:\n$ cat output.txt\n\nScript started on 2020-07-23 09:57:16+05:30\n$ ls\noutput.txt  testfile.txt  foo.txt\n$ exit\nexit\n\nScript done on 2020-07-23 09:57:34+05:30 \n\n\nA: As far as terminal emulators go ( GUI ) you can select the text with mouse and switch to text editor ( be it gedit or anything else ) and press Ctrl + Button 2 ( Scroll wheel on mouse and Right+Left click on touchpad )\nWith TTY  you could use cat /dev/vcs1 to dump contents of TTY1.\nBest approaches , however, should use terminal multiplexers such as screen , tmux, byobu or use script command to record the whole session to file.\n\nA: When you execute the command in terminal, for example:\nlspci\nJust add the > or >> symbols and file_name. For example:\nlspci > log_file.txt ... create/overwrite log_file.txt\nlspci >> log_file.txt ... append to the file\nThe output will be saved in given file.

Nevertheless, Theano offers a python code which can help determine if the calculations are being made with the CPU or the GPU and surprisingly Theano finds the CUDA installation. \nHere comes the problem: CUDA is recognized by the system but CUDA can't seem to find my GPU, and I get the error WARNING (theano.sandbox.cuda): CUDA is installed, but device gpu is not available  (error: cuda unavailable).\nI am writing in askubuntu.com and not to the Theano developers because, finding this problem, I uninstalled nvidia-cuda-* and I installed CUDA from the official package provided by NVIDIA following this guide, so that the aforementioned /usr/local/cuda was created and, again, the Theano code recognized the CUDA installation but it still couldn't find my GPU. That is the reason why I think it might be an Ubuntu issue instead of being a faulty implementation on Theano's side.\n\nA: I kind of figured out it wasn't an Ubuntu issue but a Theano one, as I installed CUDA again from the source I mentioned in the OP and I managed to correctly run sample data from the CUDA package provided by NVIDIA, ruling out (in my unexperienced opinion) an integration problem between NVIDIA-cuda-toolkit and the NVIDIA-drivers.\nFor those (in the future) having the same issue as me, the problem seems to be in the theano.sandbox.cuda module, when __init__.py tries to compile cuda_ndarray.cu in lines 168-175 (I believe, since I modified the file just slightly), when that file calls the function compiler.compile_str(...), which is a file I believe was created by Theano's development team.

This is due to bad support from AMD for the Linux drivers. Only the Open-source driver can be used. \nI stand to be corrected if some alterative way is known for installing AMD drivers.\nThe AMD graphics card supported by AMDGPU driver are listad in this link (for Ubuntu 16.04 look at 15.10 column) :https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\n", "Q: Xubuntu dunst high RSS I noticed my computer was being slower than normal so I checked the task manager and sorted by RSS usage, and dunst is using the most with 1285 MiB. That's a lot for my system, as I only have 3823 MiB of RAM.\nI'm not entirely sure what dunst is. Is it necessary or useful? For the time being I've just done\nkillall dunst\n\nbut I'm not sure how that'll effect my system.\nIf I'm missing any information please let me know and I'd be happy to look for it.\n\n\nA: From man dunst \"dunst - A customizable and lightweight notification-daemon.\" \nUnfortunately, it suffers from very poor memory leaking. A quick google search brings up several results with this issue\nAre you using spotify? That is a very quick way for Dunst to rack up RAM usage as every time the song changes you get a notification which stays in memory forever(until dunst is killed).\nI haven't found a fix, short of removing dunst, so your best bet is to run top then Shift + m to sort by memory usage.\n\nDunst should be at the top or near the top. Look to the left column to get the PID in this case, 10078. \nthen kill the dunst pid in this case:\nkill 10078\n\nIn my case, RAM usage was reduced by 22% doing that. However, Dunst will just consume more memory as you keep using your PC so you will have to do this often until Dunst is updated.\nAs for your question \"Is it necessary or useful?\" it isn't necessary; depending on your programs it can be useful. Personally it only takes about ~15 seconds to kill it every hour or so of listening to spotify so I don't uninstall it, but if you do nothing will be lost. You can remove it with\nsudo apt-get purge dunst\n\n", "Q: Jekyll not working on 16.04 My Google search showed that this question was asked here and then deleted by the asker, so I'm not sure if I'm asking something stupidly obvious.\nI'm trying to start a jekyll project after upgrading to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04.

Windows is Installed on the first, Ubuntu on the second (Along with Swap Partition). Everytime I've done this (Probably 2 dozen times), after I install Ubuntu, and Change Bios Settings (to boot ubuntu HD first), It typically boots into grub to give me he option of Booting into either OS Partition.\nBut This time is different. It won't boot into grub. I've tried changing boot sequence to boot Ubuntu HD, but it still boots straight into Windows. I've even tried Disabling the Windows Hard Drive (In BIOS), so it only has the option of booting the Ubuntu HD, but SOMEHOW it still boots straight into Windows. I would go and just disconnect the Windows Hard drive, but I really don't feel like tearing apart my new laptop. If troubleshooting comes down to it, I gotta do what I gotta do. But I really don't feel like going thru that trouble.\nI can only seem to boot the Live CD (actually live USB, Created with Universal USB Installer). I've already re-formatted and re-installed Ubuntu 3 times Trying to troubleshoot, to no avail...\nJust to be sure, Grub should be installed on the Ubuntu HD during installation, not the Windows HD correct? That's the only thing I feel like I haven't tried.\nI guess my question here is, What would be the reasons it is booting into Windows no matter what I try??\n\nA: Turns out, after digging thru all of the Links Posted to me here, The answer to my question (Just to be sure, Grub should be installed on the Ubuntu HD during installation, not the Windows HD correct?) and solution to my problem is:\nYes. Install GRUB onto the Windows Partition. So if you're having this same issue and have tried everything except for installing GRUB onto your Windows HD, Try that.

Does everything work good after doing it?\nIf so, which program did you use on Windows to do it?\n\nA: You will have to make new USB bootable key with Ubuntu. You have to run GParted from live sesion from USB because you are trying to resize the partition that would be in use if you run GParted from Ubuntu installed on hard drive. USB live key can be done with StartUp Disc Creator in Ubuntu. As commented by @oldfred the windows partition is to be shrinked by windows tool (diskmgmt).

However, after upgrading to 16.04 it seems that it only has two options, minimum which is used for about 2 minutes after boot, then maximum until I shut the computer down.  How can I fix my fan's speed control?\n\nA: I had about the same problem but with the speed of my GPU's fan and all of them over all.I used this LMT program and it started running without any problems even when the laptop is  on battery power!\n\nA: I found the same issue with the fan when installing 16.04.1 in a new ASUS ROG G501VW. I was able to workaround it by adding \"acpi_osi=!\" to the kernel command line, as instructed here (I did not actually need any of the other parameters they mention).\nMore interestingly, flashing BIOS version 301 (can be found here) solved the issue with the fan completely, and I was able to remove \"acpi_osi=!\" option. My command line does not have any custom option any more.\nFinally a couple more comments that can be useful when installing Ubuntu in this laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not insert the USB Ethernet adaptor that comes with the laptop while installing. That caused trouble in my case. It works fine after installation.\n\n*For the moment nvidia propietary drivers are needed, otherwise you find surprises as not being able to shutdown and reboot the machine from Ubuntu. The drivers also allow to switch to Intel graphics to save power.\n\n*4k is great for the models that have it, although you will have to scale up things.

I've put Ubuntu on a usb and have no issue getting into it from the usb at work. I know I have to use playonlinux to get Hearthstone on ubuntu and I know how to do that. So two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way I could simply boot Ubuntu from my USB and have hearthstone already there on its desktop ready to play?\n\n*If not, and I have to go through playonlinux, does the computer itself recognize that I'm downloading something? Not sure if that makes sense. Basically, I'll probably get in shit if I download something on a work computer. But if I'm in Ubuntu (off a USB) and I download, is that traceable? \nThanks! PS, I'm a newbie when it comes to any of this, so plain english please!\n\nA: I’m pretty sure for all intents and purposes the USB is untraceable. If you do not change any BIOS settings to show that you’re booting off a USB stick once in a while you’re safe. Wouldn’t download anything though as the computer is functioning just like normal, it is simply running a OS from a different source namely your USB, and therefore your IP address is still traceable - Now for saving a configuration on a USB I’m pretty sure you can create a persistent file when creating you USB. That should save all changes you make to the USB while using it.\n\n", "Q: akonadi services and mysqld use too much memory in kubuntu 16.04 I recently installed kubuntu 16.04 on my Dell studio xps 1640 that has 8GB of Memory installed. Everything is working fine but Something is really bothering me. After a fresh boot up, when i check the system resources, mysqld occupies about 150~200MB of RAM and a bunch of akonadi services are running(contacts, birthday,mail*, sendalter & ...) and i really don't need and use any of these services and it's a waste of Memory. But the serious problem is with mysqld, after a while(3-4 hours) mysqld occupies about 800MB~1GB of RAM and it won't release that until i reboot the system. I should mention that i don't have any running databases and don't use mysql at all! So only ubuntu is using that.\nSo my Question is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, how can i disable (remove) the unwanted akonadi services and don't let them to autostart and run at all (I disabled akonadiserver but didn't help). The only service that I'm using from akonadi is krunner and i really don't need the kMail, Calendar and ... .\n\n*Second, why mysqld is taking this amount of memory(although i guess its related to the akonadi issue mentioned above because the Parent of mysqld process is akonadiserver) and how can i prevent it. because my work is related to RAM usage and i really need the Memory so i can't let that unwanted services use this amount of resource.\nI really appreciate it if you would help me to fix this problem.\nThanks in advance for your kind help.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and although I don't know how to uninstall akonadi, I uninstalled the applications that make usage of it: kontact, kaddressbook, kmail, knotes and korganizer. Akregator doesn't seem to start akonadi so I let it installed.\nsudo apt-get remove kontact kaddressbook kmail knotes korganizer\n\nMy memory usage had decreased from almost 900MiB to less than 500MiB after the startup thanks to akonadi not being started. As akonadi is not started, neither it is that mysqld process that ends wasting more than 800MiB after a while (making a total memory usage of 1.5GiB with no any other program running).\nIf you don't want to uninstall this applications, you can close them all from the system tray. In my case there were running kmail and korganizer. In the case of korganizer, you have to uncheck the option of reminding events from its icon in the system tray (I think it appears as events reminder daemon, or something similar). This way, next time you boot the computer, this processes won't be initialized and akonadi won't be started.\nBut be aware, starting any of this applications just once will start akonadi until you shut down the computer, it's not killed when you close the application (note: you can stop it from the terminal with 'akonadictl stop').\n\nA: If you want to disable the services instead of removing them to avoid future dependency issues, You can just disable them by editing the configuration file.\nTo disable the server, edit the akonadi server configuration file at ~/.config/akonadi/akonadiserverrc. \nChange StartServer=true to StartServer=false.\n\nA: Until ubuntu provides a fix for this problem, i found a workaround!\nI use the command pkill -f akonadi and add it to the startup. System Settings>>Startup & Shutdown>>Autostart. using this command all the akonadi services get killed at startup and mysqld process will be killed along with it and all the memory occupied by them will be released.\nafter this everything works normally and i found no errors or missfunctionalities whatsoever.\nRemoving akonadi services\nUsing command sudo apt-get remove --purge kmail akonadi-server you can uninstall akonadi-server and all it's integrated services without any harmful changes to the system. this way memory usage goes under 500MB and mysqld won't run and take resources.\n\nA: This is fixed in MySQL 5.7.13 (see Bug 80772): https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-13.html#mysqld-5-7-13-bug\nThis fixed it for me.\nAt the moment the highest version available through apt is 5.7.12 so to get 5.7.13 you can use one of the options here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/\nTake your time though. I used the MySQL PPA to install and rushed the whole thing and now I've broken Akonadi in Kubuntu. Which it seems is hard to fix.\n\nA: I encountered this problem too and pkill is a little bit brutal I think\nSince I'm not using any akonadi dependent applications I make a akonadictl stop when mysqld get too much weighted. It will not restart until I launch something like Kmail, Kontact, what means never !\nUnfortunately it will resume on reboot. I didn't found any solution to fix that parmanently\n\nA: Just for reference: This is considered a mysql bug and tracked in https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1576930\nSo far the answer from Firouziam is the correct workaround for those that do not use kdepim.\n\nA: You could also switch to SQlite3 as a backend.\nWhile this is officially unsupported, there are reports that it reduces the memory foot print.\na howto can be found here:\nhttps://shevchuk.co/notes/2018/03/04/reduce-akonadi-memory-usage-to-40-mb\n", "Q: Can't install 3rd party software after 16.04 I just finished a clean install of 16.04 after some hardware changes, and I'm reconstructing system.

If i start nautilus with sudo, it also changes the icons in nautilus, but never the complete thing. \nI've tried changing it with unity-tweak-tool, dconf-editor, the console, gnome tweak tool. I did several restarts. Nothing worked. Then i upgraded to 16.04 Xenial Xerus and tried everything all over again. Nothing worked either. Now I'm writing this Question.\nI already tried deleting the user file or the whole config folder. \n$ compiz --replace\n\ndoesn't execute till the end and gets several errors. I searched all of google but couldn't find a solution. Hope you can help me. \nI got a Lenovo E460 i5 6200u, intel hd520 graphics, ssd 256gb, 8gb ram if that matters.\n\nA: In a terminal, type:\nsudo apt-get remove unity-tweak-tool && sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThen go to etc/gtk-2.0 and etc/gtk-3.0 and delete settings file. Reboot and change themes using use gnome-tweak-tool.\nIt works fine for me in Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: I managed to get my icon themes working by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatting my disk and installing 16.04 anew\n\n*Downloading my icon themes / themes and installing them manually, not with the PPA method (don't know if that matters)\n\n*Installing Unity-Tweak-Tool from the SOFTWARE CENTER (!) it doesn't work for me if i install it per terminal. \n\n\nResetting my config with \n$ dconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n$ setsid unity\n\ndid work but had to be typed in at every startup. There also was an answer to a similar question (Ubuntu 14.04.1 - Unity Tweak Tool not working?) hinting that you'd had to reset your config, purge unity, update and install it again from the software center, but that didn't work for me, I had to reinstall ubuntu.\nAs a side note: I also changed the bootup to boot UEFI first and I disabled Logical Volume Management on installation, but I doubt it has any effect on this solution.\n\nA: Tracking down a similar issue on my system after an update, I came to suspect that unity-settings-daemon was not doing its job right.\nFollowed the advice from another post on the daemon I tried reinstalling it:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install unity-settings-daemon\n\nand rebooted, which solved the problem. Worth a try in your case I think.\n", "Q: Ideapad 300 suspend not working on 16.04 I was unable to get my Ideapad 300 running properly with 14.04(no wifi and lan not functioning), so I decided to try LTS 16.04.\nEverything works well untill I tried going to suspend mode.

The instructions were not clear as to how to remove that secure boot thing but i managed to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer after installed the DKMS drivers for VBOX\n\n*You will be prompted with a blue screen with 2 options: wait or change MDK settings\n\n*Choosing change MDK settings and enter the password characters as requested, you have to press on the key corresponding to the character index being asked for and then press ENTER.\n\n*After entering 2 or 3 characters, they will ask you if you want to remove secure boot, say yes!\n\n*Computer will restart, once you are back it should work!\n\n\nA: I had the same problem when updating to Ubuntu 16.04 and found the following error message:\nStarting VirtualBox kernel modules ...failed!\n  (modprobe vboxdrv failed. Please use 'dmesg' to find out why)\n\nIt also was caused by UEFI boot. The solution is quite simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your machine and enter the BIOS Menu (In my case pressing F2)\n\n*Search for Secure Boot and change to Legacy\nIn an ASUS motherboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Advanced Mode (F7)\n\n*Go in the Secure Boot option under the Boot section\n\n*Change \"Windows UEFI mode\" with \"Other OS\"\n\n*Save and restart to apply settings (F10)\n\n\n*After restarting make sure drivers are loaded\nType:\nsudo /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup\n\nAnd you should get\nStopping VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.\nUninstalling old VirtualBox DKMS kernel modules ...done.\nTrying to register the VirtualBox kernel modules using DKMS ...done.\nStarting VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.\n\n", "Q: Application's menu missing from menu bar I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 and found that menus for many applications do not show on the menu bar, as it is configured in 'Settings > Appearance'. For example: menus for Filezilla, Geary, Libreoffice Writer and Software center do not show. I have not tested every app, but I can tell you that browsers (Chrome, Firefox) do have their menus on the menu bar. In addition, if I change the configuration to show menus \"in the window's title bar\", they don't show either.\nAny clues?\nBest regards.\n\nA: This is a reported bug that is being addressed by the developers.\nBug report:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1532226\nMissing on Startup\nRunning this command in a terminal window will bring back the menus for the current session:\n$ initctl restart unity-panel-service\n\nTo save time and having to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check first to see if the issue is resolved\n\n*Open a terminal Window\n\n*Run the command\n\n\nI wrote a short script and added it to my startup apps.  The script will do all the above.  I'll have three minutes to notice if the problem is fixed of which I can disable the startup script once the bug is fixed.\nThere's a sound notice to nudge me to check if it has been fixed... then finally the command is automatically run.\nThe menus will be fixed 4 minutes after each reboot.\nScript named resetmenus.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 180\nespeak \"Resetting unity-panel-service\"\nsleep 60\ninitctl restart unity-panel-service\n\nThe script can be added to startup by typing startup applications in the Unity Launch Search Button.\nDisappearing during logged in session\nThe script above resolves the menu problem that is always missing upon boot.  The menu subsequently disappears between boots.  When this happens I find the AltCntlT to bring up a terminal and typing unity as mentioned in the previous answer is ideal for that instance.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I did what you explained:\nsudo apt-get remove libreoffice-gtk\n\nThank you very much for the help, of course.\nI have uninstalled 2 files (libreoffice-gtk and libreoffice-gnome) and then the menu appeared (old version). \nBut then I tried installing again only libreoffice-gtk:\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-gtk\n\n...and opening the libreoffice, the menu appears correctly (new version). \nIt may be coincidence, but it worked.\n\nA: Apparently it is a confirmed bug on the release... A fix is being investigated. You can see the bug report here \nThe temporary solution is to open a terminal with ALT + CONTROL + T and typing unity. This will cause the UI to reset and fix the problem. You'll need to so this every time you boot and it happens.\nIt is still unknown why it happens, but it affects about 30% of boots.\n\nA: I had a same problem with applications like LibreOffice 5 and terminal and gedit. Menu bar was missing from these applications. It occurred after upgrading Ubuntu to 16.04 LTS from 14.04 LTS... I used following two commands and it worked for me...\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nsetsid unity\n\nUse above two commands and I hope it will work for you also...\n\nA: It happened to me in an upgrade (15.10 -> 16.04), since I couldn't fix it I created a new user and everything looks fine there.\nedit!\nWith the hurry no longer there, I went back to try recovering that user profile. Eventually I managed to get a terminal for that user (use F2, F3... until you get a -full screen- terminal), then I was able to login as the wounded user and run this commands:\n\ndpkg --configure -a\n\nOptionally, you can use this commands to clean and reconfigure the installed packages:\n\napt install -f\ndpkg-reconfigure --force\n\n\nA: Run\n\nsudo apt-get install indicator-appmenu\n\nIf this actually installs something, then you likely found the problem.\nI'm not sure what is the easiest way to actually activate the appmenu, but rebooting did the job for me.\n", "Q: Tears in chrome after upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04 I recently updated Ubuntu from 15.10 to 16.04 and right after, I started noticing tears in viewing webpages in chromium (and nowhere else).\nI tried googling the problem but couldn't find anything.\nThe problem stays even after rebooting.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Seems like ticking the Use hardware acceleration when available option in the advanced settings in chromium fixed this problem.\nI still don't know why it started only after upgrading to 16.04 though.\n", "Q: I cannot install packages like skype or steam in Ubuntu 16.04 Whenever I try to install skype or steam from the software center they are not there.

The strange thing is, it works in a fresh install of (X)Ubuntu in Virtualbox on this computer, same version.  Things I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recreating the Wineprefix\n\n*Reinstalling Wine\n\n*Using both a wired and wireless connection to the router.\n\nA: It is a firewall that blocks connections from the brick. The easiest way to fix the problem is to disable firewall by sudo service ufw stop, but it's a bad idea in general. Instead, you could setup rules to allow.\nI guess, Lego Mindstorm sends a broadcast request, and waits for incoming connections from anyone (from the brick in our case). That means, you need to allow incoming connections either:\n\n\n*\n\n*from an interface\n\n*using a subnet\n\n*from a specific IP\n\n*to a specific port\n\n*using a specific protocol (i.e. http, https, ssh)\n\n*any combination of above. \n\n\nSo, one rule you could use is sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.6, since it's the address of your brick. But I don't know how the address is assigned to the brick, whether it is dynamic, and would you want to use it with another one (with different IP), so probably better way would be to find the port in use, and setup a rule for that. First, temporary disable firewall (sudo service ufw stop), execute in terminal sudo tcpdump -nni any src 192.168.0.6 and dst 192.168.0.6, and connect the app to the brick. You would see an info about packets going between your host and brick, the port is written right after IP of your PC, like …192.168.0.6.52382 > 192.168.0.1.80… Then you can use:\nsudo ufw allow PortNumberYouGot # e.g. sudo ufw allow 21\n\nor better yet is to allow only a specific subnet:\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port PortNumberYouGot\n\n", "Q: What files does Déjà Dup back up?

However,  I find the wifi connection gets lost randomly (about every 30 minutes) even when the computer is running and the network icon remains the connected state when connection is lost.\nAnother issue after adding the code is, when I put my computer to sleep, the screen will turn off for a second but then turns back on for around 5 seconds(during which the system will cut off wifi connection). And then the computer will go to sleep after this unusual \"two-phase\" process.\nWireless cards info below\n*-network               \n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: wlp2s0\n       version: 00\n       serial: b0:c0:90:5c:1c:d5\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=rtl8723be driverversion=4.4.0-21-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.0.8 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:16 ioport:d000(size=256) memory:df200000-df203fff\n\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Host Bridge/DRAM Registers (rev 07)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sky Lake PCIe Controller (x16) (rev 07)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Integrated Graphics (rev 06)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H USB 3.0 xHCI Controller (rev 31)\n00:14.2 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H Thermal subsystem (rev 31)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H CSME HECI #1 (rev 31)\n00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SATA controller [AHCI mode] (rev 31)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev f1)\n00:1d.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PCI Express Root Port #9 (rev f1)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H LPC Controller (rev 31)\n00:1f.2 Memory controller: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H PMC (rev 31)\n00:1f.3 Audio device: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H HD Audio (rev 31)\n00:1f.4 SMBus: Intel Corporation Sunrise Point-H SMBus (rev 31)\n00:1f.6 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection (2) I219-V (rev 31)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK208 [GeForce GT 730] (rev a1)\n01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GK208 HDMI/DP Audio Controller (rev a1)\n02:00.0 Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

Wifi connection gets lost about every 5 minutes and I have to reconnect or restart network-manager.\n\nA: I was having the same problem.  I fixed the suspend wake issue by creating this script at /etc/systemd/system/wifi-resume.service (the one the OP posted only worked for the active session; on reboot it had to be called again): \n#/etc/systemd/system/wifi-resume.service\n#sudo systemctl enable wifi-resume.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Restart networkmanager at resume\nAfter=suspend.target\nAfter=hibernate.target\nAfter=hybrid-sleep.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/bin/systemctl restart network-manager.service\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=suspend.target\nWantedBy=hibernate.target\nWantedBy=hybrid-sleep.target\n\nThen just issue this command in terminal to activate it: sudo systemctl enable wifi-resume.service.  This solution is from another askubuntu question answer, and works both after suspend and after reboot. \nHowever, even after that was fixed, I get the same behavior that used to happen on wake from suspend when I try to switch wifi networks:  the wifi is essentially dead, with the two arrows, and the applet says \"device not ready.\"  I can restart the wifi by issuing sudo service network-manager restart, but I can't switch networks.  \nIs anyone else experiencing this and/or have a solution???\n\nA: Finally I was able to fix the issues after trying out numbers of different methods. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get details of your PCI wireless card by running sudo lshw -class network\n\n*Get your card model info according to the product line.\nFor instance, as you can see in the question description it says product: RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter so the model of my card is RTL8723BE\nOr product: RTL8101/2/6E PCI Express Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controller\nso the model of my card is RTL8101/2/6E\n\n*Give the permission sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/config.d/\n\n*Open or create config and add SUSPEND_MODULES=\"rtl8723be\"(replace rtl8723be with your own model number) \nThen run echo \"options rtl8723be fwlps=N\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf \n(note that when replacing rtl8723be with my card which is RTL8101/2/6E i should only type .../modprobe.d/RTL8101.conf; and /2/6E shouldn't be written)\nFinaly restart your system.\nNow your system should be able to reconnect automatically after sleep, and wifi connection never got lost once for me after doing this. \n\"The up/down arrows is likely a network manager bug that results in network manager thinking the wifi device is actually ethernet.\", according to Jeremy31.see bug info here You should be able to fix it by installing NetworkManager-1.2.0.\nThanks to Jeremy31 for providing the solutions.\n\nA: I have the exact same problem. After waking from sleep, wifi still works but networks not showing. I solve the problem by restarting the network manager.\nsudo service network-manager restart\nStill very annoying. I hope they fix this issue soon.\n\nA: This is a bug for sure.

So not sure if this a good workaround :-)\n\nA: There is no solution at all right now but I found a script that helped me to keep wlan up:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Ping you most used DNS Server and reconnect on fail\n\n\nwhile true; do\n  if ! ping -c 1 -w 1 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null; then\n\n    # with \"sudo iwconfig\" you can examine your name of 'wlan0'\n    nmcli d connect wlan0\n\n  fi\n  sleep 2;\ndone\n\nto Autostart this script simply open gnome-session-properties and add it to the list.\nThe full script (without reconnect) can be found on this web page.\n\nA: Additional info: I have the same exact problem as OP describes, but only the problem where the nm-applet icon changes to arrows and does not display wifi info. The wifi still works when this happens.\n$ killall nm-applet && nm-applet & \n\nDoes the trick for getting the icon to display again, so it's just a workaround for now in case someone wants to put it into a script. \nCan confirm this problem on two separate computers running xubuntu-desktop package.\nAlso, both computers I have run recent intel wifi cards.

But while doing this this shows the problem that you should have gpt partaion. So i have to make this parataion from ubuntu but couldn't. So please help me \n\nA: You're headed down the wrong path. Fundamentally, you need to understand that most modern computers support two entirely different and incompatible ways of booting:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS mode -- This is the old method of booting, which uses (typically) the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system and boot code that's stored in the first sector of the disk (aka the MBR). Old computers used BIOSes, but new ones support this mode through a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka \"legacy mode support\" or a similar term.\n\n*EFI mode -- This is the new method of booting, which typically uses a GUID Partition Table (GPT) on the disk and boot code stored as a file in the EFI System Partition (ESP). The EFI is a replacement for the BIOS, but many people and manufacturers continue to use the term \"BIOS\" in reference to EFIs, which is misleading. Also, know that the Unified EFI (UEFI) is EFI version 2.x; most new computers are actually UEFI-based, but Macs continue to use EFI 1.1.\n\n\nBased on your symptoms, it sounds like you've got Linux installed in BIOS mode, but you've booted your Windows installation medium in EFI mode, so it's complaining that the disk uses MBR rather than GPT. (Note that MBR and GPT are both systems for partitioning the entire disk, so all the disk's partitions will be MBR or all will be GPT.) The solution to this problem is to figure out how to get the Windows installation disk to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Forcing one boot mode or another can be tricky, and details vary from one computer to another. Typically, you'll need to enter the computer's built-in boot manager and select the entry for the boot medium that does not include the string \"UEFI.\"\nAn alternative to this would be to convert from MBR to GPT partitioning by using gdisk on the disk, install Windows in EFI mode, and then install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. This approach has the advantage that it's usually possible to disable the CSM in an EFI, which simplifies the boot process; however, it will be more work up front to do all this.\n", "Q: vmware error after upgrade to ubuntu 16.04 I just upgraded to ubuntu 16.04 and I started having problems with vmware (v 12.1.0 build-3272444).\nWhen I try to play the virtual machine I receive the following error: Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory.

Typically in cases like this it is recommended to execute sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all, however in my case this doesn't work. In the command log I can see that there are issues.\nStarting VMware services:\n   Virtual machine monitor                                        failed\n   Virtual machine communication interface                         done\n   VM communication interface socket family                        done\n   Blocking file system                                            done\n   Virtual ethernet                                               failed\n   VMware Authentication Daemon                                    done\nUnable to start services\n\nIn the vmware log as well I can see that there problems.

However, after it completed and I rebooted...nothing! but a black terminal that said only 'Grub Repair>', not a usual TTY screen.\nI have used Grub Repair Disk and tried everything I can think of over 25 times.....still it won't boot. Here is the log of the last try.\nPlease, if anyone can see the problem [!and the/an answer!] let me know! Thanks! I see some indications I am not the only one with this or similar problem. I had NO major error messages during the upgrade...so am surprised. The minor ones were only messages that I'd have to reinstall x or y minor programs. No errors were recorded upon completion, and it said it had upgraded successfully...but had it?!\nQuestion. I use an AMD graphics board and used to use Catalyst. I'm aware this is no longer available, but should have been replaced by Linux drivers [which are listed as excellent for my board]....but could this be the problem, and if so, how to know or fix?\nThe very last thing I can think of possibly causing a problem is that I chose GDM3 rather than GDM or LightDM. Is there a problem with this?\nIf I were to use a live disk to attempt a fix, what would I do, and in what order? I did not try, as I thought the Boot Repair Disk did anything the live disk could [assuming, as I so far have, it was a grub problem alone]. Perhaps I'm wrong. Many thanks.\nI know there will be some replies suggesting a 'clean install'. I have my reasons to avoid that unless death is the only other alternative. ;-)\n\nA: Ha second time in 5 minutes I have recommended this only for different issues.... If its a grub issue, use http://www.supergrubdisk.org/ to scan and repair the boot partition.

Authentication not configured?\n\nI guess updating also updated my apache2  from apache2.2  to apache2.4.18 and I'm assuming that is why my website is completely hosed and so is owncloud. I have no idea what to do about this error .. weird thing is .. it works fine on my phone to view the list of files, I cant download anything, but I guess I can view the list because its an app not a \"website\" and the app is doing the auth like it should.\nI finally got zoneminder to work so I know that MySQL and PHP are working. I tried to look it up and only found stuff like you need to have authz_core_module installed .. I believe I do... authz_core is enabled in my apache modules. I'm at a loss... any suggestions?\nEdit:\nStill working on the issue ...

I think it was the upgrade from php5 to php7 that broke everything.  Owncloud supports php7, but maybe it requires reinstallation to use it. Just to note, I installed owncloud from the package available via opensuse.\nThe steps I took were:\nsudo apt-get remove owncloud\n\nI then edited the source list file that the upgrader disabled and uncommented the source line (remove the # symbol in front)\nsudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owncloud.list\n\nThen I updated and reinstalled\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install owncloud\n\nWhen I went back to my owncloud url, it presented a typical owncloud upgrade screen that proceeded for around 1-2 minutes, then my login appeared. Hope this works for you.\n\nA: I had different issues with my 16.04 upgrade but eventually got it working.  Make sure there is an owncloud.conf in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and /etc/apache2/conf-enabled.  Also make sure your data directory is configured correctly in /var/www/owncloud/config/config.php and also make sure the www-data user/group owns and has read/write permissions.  If you're still having issues lookup the manual install instructions and make sure all the needed php modules are installed and enabled (can't link because the owncloud website is blocked at my work for some reason).  The manual instructions have all the modules as php5_modulename, so just use php_modulename instead to get the php 7 version.\nDon't forget to check the apache error log at /var/log/apache2/error.log to see if it gives you any helpful errors.\n\nA: The solution should not be to replace your custom config.php owncloud configuration file, with the default one. By doing that, you have turned off additional settings you have made, like caching.\nProblem here is that you have upgraded OS version and, also, PHP version, among other stuff. REDIS PHP extension is compiled for an earlier version of PHP and there's a mismatch between those two.\nYou can run in shell:\nphp -v\n\nThe above will return something like:\nPHP Warning: PHP Startup: redis: Unable to initialize module REDIS compiled with module API=20050922 PHP compiled with module API=20090626\n\nThese options need to match in Unknown on line 0\nYou can temporary comment out REDIS server config in OwnCloud config/config.php to make it operational, but I suggest to fix this problem (same thing as replacing custom config.php with default config.php and entering new values).\nNow, to the solution :) ... to fix this, you need to compile (upgrade) REDIS PHP extension. There is a GITHub project. Go to shell and:\nEnter TMP dir, create directory named \"redisphpext\" and enter into it...\ncd /tmp\nmkdir redisphpext\ncd redisphpext\n\nDownload GitHub project and extract it:\nwget https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis/archive/master.zip\nunzip master.zip\ncd phpredis-master\n\nCompile :) :\nphpize\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nAfter that, remove comments from REDIS configuration in config/config.php (if you commented it out).\nThat should solve your problem and you should have your OwnCloud fully operational.\nP.S: If you messed up with the \"redis.ini\", you should add one line in it:\necho \"extension=redis.so\" > /etc/php5/conf.d/redis.ini\n\nor you can use vi, vim, nano... to manually enter line in redis.ini:\nextension=redis.so\n\nThat's all.\n\nA: I just worked through upgrading the server Owncloud is on from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04, I found this was what I had to do to restore everything;\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-Add the Owncloud apt repository\n\n*do sudo apt-get update\n\n*do sudo apt-get install owncloud\nDoing this installed the required dependencies and kicked Owncloud into maintenance mode.

I would like all FAT volumes to be mounted with the option uni_xlate enabled.\nHow can I configure mount or udisks2 to use that option while mounting the volume?\n\nA: It turns out is is not possible at all, as explained in another answer in unix.SE. The reason is that mount options are hardcoded in udisk2 (see FSMountOptions in udiskslinuxfilesystem.c).\nA patch has been proposed to make mount options user-configurables but it has not been integrated as of April 2016.\n\nA: You can set mount options when mounting from the command-line by using the -o flag and specifying the options separated by commas exactly as you would with the mount command.\nTo mount /dev/sdb1 with the noatime mount option, use the following command.\nudisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1 -o noatime\n\nThe ability to modify the allowed and default mount options is now available in udisks2 as of version 2.9.0.\nSee the documentation here for how to configure default and allowed mount options.\nSince 2.9.0 isn't shipped with Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 I also wrote up a tutorial on how to install it from source on Ubuntu 18.04 here for anyone who is interested.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 broken after upgrade When my desktop rebooted after upgrading Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 to 16.04, startup gets stuck in a state where it constantly switches between a terminal and graphics mode, as if it tries to start graphics but fails. It keeps doing that every 10 seconds or so.\nMy system is a recent PC desktop with a decent NVidia GeForce GTX 970.\nSo I suspect a problem with the graphics drivers, and I'm savvy enough to try and repair it from a console... IF the system would let me have a console.\nWhen I CTRL-ALT-F1 for the TTY1 console, I'm lucky if I can squeeze in a couple of keystrokes before it switches back to graphics (which doesn't work). Then I need to hit CTRL-ALT-F1 again to try and get the next few keystrokes in. This is not workable.\nSo then I decided to restart in repair mode. Same problem: can't get a working console.\nSo then I decided to try and repair it using the live DVD. But when I boot it it gets stuck. I get passed the UEFI stuff. I tried both \"Install ubuntu...\" and \"Try without installing...\", but in both cases startup just get stuck after a couple of minutes DVD activity.\nInspired by https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions, I tried with several combinations of boot parameters, such as vga=791, noapic, noacpi, ... But none seem to make any kind of difference.\nI've been using Ubuntu since Hardy, and I've hit \"system broken after upgrade\" problems several times before, but in all cases I was able to fix them using a console and/or live DVD. Except this time...\nSo I'm basically dead in the water here.\n\nA: It is very difficult to type in a constantly switching console, but not impossible. I found out that the constant switching was caused by gdm3, so I stopped stopped it:\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm3 stop\n\nI could probably have done it by ssh-ing to my desktop as well, which would probably have spared me the difficulty of having to type in a constantly switching console.\nOnce I got my console back, I figured out that it was a combination of the kernel and the nvidia-304 driver that was causing the problem (the usual suspects).

I had installed a newer kernel in 15.10 (I believe the 4.4.2 kernel), but the kernel of 16.04 is supposed to have working wifi with xps 13 out of the box. However, right after installing and rebooting, it seems to have lost my wifi. Is there something I have overlooked? Or better said, how to get it working again? \n\nA: Found in other answers, this is how I fixed the problem:\nsudo lshw -C network\n*-network\n    (...)\n    logical name: wlp58s0\n    (...)\n\nI then ran sudo ifconfig wlp58s0 up and after that sudo service network-manager restart. This fixed my wifi and after reboot it is still working.\nSince the dell xps13 (9350) has had many troubles with wifi, I hope this will help others to fix theirs too.\nEDIT: This only fixes it once, after reboot the same steps have to be performed again to get it back on.\n\nA: Disabling secure boot in the BIOS solved the problem for me. I found the answer on the dell forums. (http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19683197)\n\nA: Found this on Dell community page. And this solved the problem for me :\nGo to software & Updates, enable\"Proprietary drivers for devices\"\nReload sources, and apt-get upgrade \nIt'll grab the latest broadcom drivers and intel microcode, you'll need to disable secure boot if its enabled, reboot, and it should work. \nDid it on my 9343 to 16.04 with kernel 4.4.0-21-generic\n\nA: none of this works permanently. I believe the wireless card used in the XPS is just not compatible with ubuntu 16. \nhttps://www.windowscentral.com/dell-xps-wifi-fix-upgrade-wireless\nDoing a search on these issues brings quite a few pages. I feel Dell have fallen short on providing an Ubuntu compatible laptop.\nI am going to change the wireless card, but if that does not work, I will have to get a mac. Changing back to ubuntu 14 is not an option, as a bunch of things are no longer supported. This is pretty substandard effort of dell, cannonical etc.\nAlso the problem goes away when using a different router for instance, or even more confusing only happens while using one of a range of routers, butg no other device has a problem with the router in question. When you restart network services, sometimes the network comes back good and fast for all of one minute, then stops. Signal shows good, but no network. At first I thought it was DNS, so manually set DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Nope. Then I thought it may be IPV6 causing the issue, so I forced the connection to be IPV4 (This worked for Ubuntu 14). Then drivers, new drivers, old drivers no dice. Then obscure network settings regarding security. I have changed a whole heap with no Joy. \nThe only thing I have not tried is replacing the wireless card. That is next.\n\nA: I was able to solve this on an XPS 13 9343 by switching to Legacy BIOS instead of UEFI running Ubuntu 19.04. None of the solutions I read about online have solved this, but switching off UEFI did the trick for me.\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 using a bootable USB stick I use Ubuntu 14.04 and I want to upgrade my version of Ubuntu to the latest 16.04 LTS release. One way to do that is using the update-manager. Is there any other way to do it ? Like using a  bootable USB stick with 16.04 on it.\n\nA: Go to your Unity Dash, locate \"Startup creator\" and create a bootable installation USB disk using it. You will of course first download the *.iso image. Make sure that your USB is recognized when you plug it in, so that the creator knows which drive to use.\nThen boot your computer using the USB. \n\nA: Upgrade your system \nFirst you have to check if there is a new version of Ubuntu\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d \n\nWait for the system to finish installing , it takes time patience is needed :-) ..\nWhen it finishes reboot Ubuntu\nVerify all packages are up to date\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\n\nClear the cache\nYou don't want to keep that 1 or 2 Go of dependencies slowing down your system of course \nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nVerify your version\nlsb_release -a\n\nYou should get Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerius as output\n", "Q: Why do I get \"Required key not available\" when install 3rd party kernel modules or after a kernel upgrade?

If you'd want to keep Secure Boot and also run these modules, then the next logical step is to sign those modules.\nSo let's try it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create signing keys\nopenssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj \"/CN=Descriptive name/\"\n\n\n*Sign the module\nsudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der /path/to/module\n\nNote 1: There can be multiple files to be signed for a single driver/module, so /path/to/module may need to be replaced with $(modinfo -n <modulename>), e.g. $(modinfo -n vboxdrv)\nNote 2: sudo kmodsign sha512 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der /path/to/module is an alternative if sign-file is not available.\n\n\n*Register the keys to Secure Boot\nsudo mokutil --import MOK.der\n\nSupply a password for later use after reboot\n\n*Reboot and follow instructions to Enroll MOK (Machine Owner Key). Here's a sample with pictures. The system will reboot one more time.\nIf the key has been enrolled properly, it will show up under sudo mokutil --list-enrolled. \nPlease let me know if your modules would run this way on Ubuntu 16.04 (on kernel 4.4.0-21, I believe).\nResources: Detailed website article for Fedora and Ubuntu implementation of module signing. (they've been working on it) ;-)\nAdditional resource: I created a bash script for my own use every time virtualbox-dkms upgrades and thus overwrites the signed modules. Check out my vboxsign originally on GitHub.\nAdditional note for the security (extra-)conscious: ;-)\nSince the private key you created (MOK.priv in this example) can be used by anyone who can have access to it, it is good practice to keep it secure. You may chmod it, encrypt (gpg) it, or store it somewhere else safe(r). Or, as noted in this comment, remove the option -nodes in step number 1. This will encrypt the key with a passphrase.\n\nA: You can also Disable Secure Boot in shim-signed running sudo update-secureboot-policy. This wiki page explains this method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T), and execute sudo update-secureboot-policy and then select Yes.\n\n*Enter a temporary password between 8 to 16 digits. (For example, 12345678, we will use this password later\n\n*Enter the same password again to confirm.\n\n*Reboot the system and press any key when you see the blue screen (MOK management\n\n*Select Change Secure Boot state\n\n*Enter the password you had selected in Step 2 and press Enter.\n\n*Select Yes to disable Secure Boot in shim-signed.\n\n*Press Enter key to finish the whole procedure.\n\nYou can still enable Secure Boot in shim-signed again. Just execute\nsudo update-secureboot-policy --enable\nand then follow the steps above\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu kernel 4.4.0-20 the EFI_SECURE_BOOT_SIG_ENFORCE kernel config has been enabled. That prevents from loading unsigned third party modules if UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.\nThe easiest way to fix this issue is to disable Secure Boot in UEFI (BIOS) settings.\nIn most cases you can get into UEFI settings using grub menu. Press ESC button on booting, get into grub menu and select System Setup. Secure Boot option should be in \"Security\" or \"Boot\" section of the UEFI.\nYou can get into UEFI directly, but it depends on your hardware. Read your computer manual to see how to get there. It may be Del, or F2 on boot, or something else.\nAn alternative way is to disable Secure Boot using mokutil.\nSince Ubuntu kernel build 4.4.0-21.37 this can be fixed by running\nsudo apt install mokutil\nsudo mokutil --disable-validation\n\nIt will require to create a password. The password should be at least 8 characters long. After you reboot, UEFI will ask if you want to change security settings. Choose \"Yes\".\nThen you will be asked to enter the previously created password. Some UEFI firmware asks not for the full password, but to enter some characters of it, like 1st, 3rd, etc. Be careful. Some people do not understand this. I did not get  it from the first attempt either ;-)\nUpdate: Now this kernel config is enabled in all supported Ubuntu kernels.

You need to set a password for booting form Security (BIOS) to be able to bring the option to disable Secure Boot.  \nStep - 2: Download and install Ubuntu 64 bit only.\nAfter restarting, it will boot directly to Win 10 without giving any option for booting into Ubuntu.\nStep - 3: Download boot-repair-disk and use it to fix the booting.

I have been through the installation a couple of times but I was not prompted or given the option to choose the file system which is rather odd. \nYour support is appreciated. \nThanks,\nAsif. \n\nA: \nNote: This will not work if \"Easy Install\" option in VMware is used, which will automatically set up Ubuntu with a default set of settings. When prompted to create the Virtual Machine, select the Ubuntu version in the OS type, but don't specify the ISO and use \"I will install the operating system later\", do not automatically power up the VM, and edit the VM to use the ISO, then boot to the ISO and manually do system setup as detailed below.\n\nI'll walk you through the manual partition manager for Ubuntu Server.\nInitially it is the same install, I'll assume you have gotten that far.\nOnce you get to this screen, select \"Manual\":\n\nThis next part depends on how you want to install, however due to you using VMWare we will use the full disk.

In manual mode, you have to do a bit more to get the same job done.

I know I can upgrade an individual snap with the sudo snap refresh $SNAPNAME command, but I'm wondering whether there is a single command to upgrade all snaps at once.\nOr are they upgraded automatically? And if so, how often and when?\n\nA: From snapd 2.0.8 (available in Ubuntu 16.04 updates), there is a new command (snap refresh) that refreshes all snaps.\nThis command is run automatically daily.\nThis was announced in the snapcraft mailing list.\n", "Q: Are apt-get commands being phased out? It is now possible to use apt commands alongside apt-get commands within Ubuntu. In an attempt to answer a question on Ask Ubuntu I was informed that apt-get will soon become deprecated.\nIs this true, and is there any official timeline for the phasing out of apt-get?\n\nA: \"Soon\" is a strange concept in something with supported releases, like Ubuntu.\n16.04 is supported into 2020 so apt-get will be around as a primary tool at least until then.\nAs pure conjecture, it might be relegated to an alias (or something like that) one day but getting rid of it completely could cause significant scripting issues. A complete change of package manager seems just as likely.\nSo at this point in time, I'd be asking anybody spouting \"omg it's deprecated\" to cite their source. Or explain what they mean by deprecated. \n", "Q: Where can Ubuntu snaps write data? Applications packaged as snaps in Ubuntu are installed (mounted) under the /snap/$SNAPPNAME location. Everything under /snap is mounted as a read-only file system, thus applications cannot write to that space, neither in other app's directories nor in their own.\nWhile there is a home interface that snaps can specify to read/write the user's home directory, it is reserved for security reasons and needs to be manually connected (enabled) by the user.\nSo where can an app inside a snap write its config, data and other files? Are there APIs to access special writeable locations?\n\nA: When you declare apps in your snapcraft.yaml, it results in a binary wrapper being generated upon install and placed into /snap/bin/, named after your package and app name (note that if the app is a service, this wrapper is instead a systemd .service file).\nThat wrapper contains most of the environment under which the application will run. The two environment variables that are most relevant to this question are SNAP_DATA and SNAP_USER_DATA. You can find more information about these in the documentation, but I'll describe them here as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*SNAP_DATA is a system-wide writable area (in /var/snap/). This might be used to host logs for services, for instance.\n\n*SNAP_USER_DATA is a user-specific writable area in the home directory of the user running the application (specifically /home/<user>/snap/). This might be used for user-specific configuration files, etc.\nBoth of these directories are very important to the upgrade/rollback functionality, since both of them are versioned. That is, each revision of a given snap has its own copy of these directories. Let me explain with an example.\nSay you install revision 1 of the \"foo\" snap. That will create two directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/snap/foo/1 (SNAP_DATA)\n\n*/home/<user>/snap/foo/1 (SNAP_USER_DATA)\n\n\nNow say \"foo\" uses both of these. Maybe it has a service that hosts a database in SNAP_DATA, and a binary that uses config files in SNAP_USER_DATA.\nNow revision 2 of \"foo\" is released, and it's automatically updated. The first thing that happens is that /var/snap/foo/1 is copied into /var/snap/foo/2 and /home/<user>/snap/foo/1 is copied into /home/<user>/snap/foo/2. Then the new revision is fired up. It should notice that it's running on old data, and maybe it has some database migrations to run to the database in SNAP_DATA. It does that, and away it goes.\nNow say those migrations fail for whatever reason, and this application needs to be rolled back. It begins using the old revision of the /snap/foo application, where SNAP_DATA was pointing to /var/snap/foo/1 and SNAP_USER_DATA was pointing to /home/<user>/snap/foo/1. This picks things up on the old version at the point before the migrations were run, since those operations were run on a copy of the data.\nLong story short: don't use the home interface to store data you can be storing in SNAP_DATA or SNAP_USER_DATA, since they're an integral part of the upgrade/rollback strategy. Take advantage of them!\nUPDATE for v2.0.10:\nTwo new data directories were also introduced:\n\n\n*\n\n*SNAP_COMMON sits alongside SNAP_DATA, but is specifically unversioned. Every revision of the specific snap has access to this directory, so it's not copied upon upgrade/rollback etc. This might be used for particularly large, unversioned files (e.g. raw data that isn't really version-specific).\n\n*SNAP_USER_COMMON sits alongside SNAP_USER_DATA, but is again specifically unversioned. It might be used for storing non-version-specific data per user.\nUPDATE for v2.15:\nThe files placed within /snap/bin are no longer wrappers that define the environment, but symlinks to /usr/bin/snap. So the way to determine the environment under which an application runs would be to use snap run --shell <snap>.<app>, for example:\n$ sudo snap install hello-world\n$ snap run --shell hello-world\nTo run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\n$ env | grep SNAP\nSNAP_USER_COMMON=/home/kyrofa/snap/hello-world/common\nSNAP_REEXEC=\nSNAP_LIBRARY_PATH=/var/lib/snapd/lib/gl:\nSNAP_COMMON=/var/snap/hello-world/common\nSNAP_USER_DATA=/home/kyrofa/snap/hello-world/27\nSNAP_DATA=/var/snap/hello-world/27\nSNAP_REVISION=27\nSNAP_NAME=hello-world\nSNAP_ARCH=amd64\nSNAP_VERSION=6.3\nSNAP=/snap/hello-world/27\n\n", "Q: Unable to mount second hard drive I have a machine with two hard drives. One hard drive is dual-boot, and has both Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 10 installed. The other hard drive is reserved for storage. Until recently, this storage hard drive was accessible from both the Windows and Ubuntu partitions. To do this in Ubuntu, I would open Nautilus and then on the left, there are three items under Devices, which are: 250 GB Volume, Storage, and Computer.

I have tried booting into Windows and shutting down fully as suggested, but this did not help.\nThank you.\n\nA: This happens when you have fast startup checked in the windows control under power options and then system setting, you want to uncheck it. \nThe reason Ubuntu wont mount it as it is in hibernated state and any file you copy to windows partition might not exist when you boot to windows. This is a security feature in Ubuntu.

And I had a lot of problems with libdbd-mysql-perl; the system said that was not going to install that library.\nSo I thought to install it with the Aptitude that install a package and correct all the dependencies.\nIf you don't have aptitude you can get it like this:sudo apt-get install aptitude\nFirst all you need to uninstall your existing mysql.\nNext you need to install the package that you want.\nsudo aptitude install mysql-server-5.6\n\nThe aptitude give you a lot of option, what to do. The first options is to keep the actual package. \nSo press (N)o until you find the option that say to downgrade the next packages:\nlibmysqlclient20 [5.7.14-1ubuntu16.04 (<NULL>, now) -> 5.7.13-0ubuntu0.16\nmysql-common [5.7.14-1ubuntu16.04 (<NULL>, now) -> 5.6.30-1+deb.sury.org\n\nthen press (Y)es and the aptitude is going to install the mysql-server-5.6. Here's the option that you should accept:\n\nIf after that the system cannot connect to mysql server you need to restart your computer.\n\nA: The MySQL developers provide Xenial packages of MySQL 5.6 in their own repositories, and this should thus be preferred over installing the official Ubuntu Trusty packages, since it is in general better to install packages which were created for your version of Ubuntu.\nIf you already have MySQL Server packages, you should first uninstall them; just uninstall everything that is shown by dpkg -l | grep mysql-server.\nJust download and install the mysql-apt-config DEB package in the previous link. During the installation, it will ask which version you want, so you can choose 5.6. After the package is done installing, sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql-server-5.6 will install MySQL Server 5.6.\n", "Q: Cannot set IPv4 address I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 in HP EliteDesk 800 G2 SFF, in which Windows 7 is also installed.

But when I start using the computer (just opening firefox, nothing heavy at all) the fans start roaring at full power and keep on all the time. The laptop came preinstaled with Windows 10 and it did not have this issue there. Also, I am dual-booting.\nWhat can I do to make the fan work as it should? \nI have tried various solutions from several similar questions on here, but none have worked. Most of them did not seem to have worked for the original posters, either...\n\nA: Installing the latest nvidia drivers and restarting made it work in the end. I also removed acpi=off from my boot parameters.\n", "Q: Is there an embedded board that runs a GUI? I'm working on a project that currently uses an embedded board with the Debian OS.  However, we are looking for a new board, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a board that comes loaded with a GUI such as Ubuntu?  I'm looking for a board that I can plug in a monitor and keyboard and just develop on the board using a GUI much like a complete laptop.  Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Raspberry Pi! You can install the Debian-based Raspbian or if you're going to use a Raspberry Pi 2 or Pi 3, you can install Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3.\nBoth of those come with a GUI built-in and have very good support. They're also fairly low power, so a great option for an embedded system.\nAnother option would be the BeagleBone Black. While they aren't officially supported by BeagleBone, you can install Ubuntu-desktop and GNOME-desktop.\n\nA: Qualcomm Snapdragon based development boards are available with ubuntu/debian OS supports. More info. \n", "Q: Pm-Powersave file in /var/log is 32 GB I've been getting messages saying that I've been running out of diskspace on my machine, and my /var/log folder is 33 GB large. Looking closer it all seems to come from one file pm-powersave.log. Is it supposed to be this large? If not how do I proceed on reducing the size of this behemoth. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You could have logrotate rotate the log every day and only keep 1 or 2 days of logs. You can accomplish this by editing /etc/logrotate.d/pm-utils to something like this:\n/var/log/pm-suspend.log {\n       weekly\n       rotate 4\n       delaycompress\n       compress\n       notifempty\n       missingok\n}\n\n/var/log/pm-powersave.log {\n       daily\n       rotate 2\n       delaycompress\n       compress\n       notifempty\n       missingok\n}\n\nThis retains the default logrotate settings for pm-suspend.log, and makes two changes to the settings for pm-powersave.log: \n\n\n*\n\n*Rotation frequency has been decreased from weekly to daily\n\n*The number of logs to keep in rotation has been decreased from 4 to 2\nNow, you will have 2 pm-powersave.log files for just the last 2 days, each of which should be a more manageable size. If you find you need the logs, you can increase it to 5-7, if you don't use them, you can safely decrease it to 1. \nThis is just a workaround. I am in the process of looking into disabling pm-powersave logging, or at least changing the log level to something less verbose. I will report back if I find anything promising. \n", "Q: Problems with Audio device (ALC-889) - Ubuntu 16.04 Okay I think I need some help with my on-board audio device and Ubuntu 16.04.\nMy on-board Audio device according to sudo lspci is:\n*Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)*\n\naplay -l prints:\n    **** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 0: ALC889 Analog [ALC889 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 1: ALC889 Digital [ALC889 Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: HDMI [HDA ATI HDMI], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nIt used to work fine with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 but not with the current lts version 16.04. I get no sound at all and it doesn't even show up in the \"sound settings tab\" so maybe it's a driver gone wrong issue with 16.04?\nI tried every single suggested solution from older posts but still no luck. Any ideas?\nDesktop System Specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i3 540 @ 3.07GHz\n\n*8.00GB DDR3\n\n*ASUSTeK Computer INC. P7H55-M PRO (LGA1156)\n\n*1024MB ATI AMD Radeon R7 200 Series\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The issue is that Ubuntu 16.04 defaults to HDMI as default audio if HDMI is present on your computer. In my case, it does see my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 card, but HDMI (from my video cards) is set as default; and the way to change that differs from how you did that in 14.04. \nThe files, folders and procedures almost work, but don't if you follow 14.04's \"No Sound\" issues because file names and locations have changed in 16.04. I get this information from a week of Googling and experimenting. But it appears that it is a known bug so an answer should be coming soon. In the mean time, I guess we both have to wait. When I need sound, I revert to a 14.04 netbook. Netbooks can't meet the system requirements of 16.04, but more than meet 14.04's requirements. That should say something.\nAlthough I don't have an answer for you, I hope this gives you some insight into the issue we are having. If you come up with something, let me know. Thanks,\n\nA: Don't know if you are still having issues with this, I experienced a similar problem on my mini PC. It also has the Intel Wildcat audio device; I managed to fix it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install  pavucontrol (PulseAudio Volume Control); it's available on the software centre as well\n\n*On the \"Configuration\" tab, check if you have 2 profiles\n\n*Set the profile you don't need to \"Off\". In my case it was the one with a whole lot of analogue options\n\n\nOnce I did this, all the weird behaviour stopped and my audio was working on all applications (I was specifically interested in Kodi, however Rythmbox, VLC and Videos also started working). I've now got fully functional 5.1 surround. Strangely, youtube streaming on Firefox had audio before the change (and after of course :) ).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I was having this exact same issue after upgrading to 16.04 with my Focusrite Saffire 2i4, I finally found this and fixed it with this command, then rebooting:\nsudo apt-get remove fwupd\n\nYou probably don't want to do that if you actually need fwupd, but it looks like there's already a bug report out there, hopefully it will get fixed soon.\n\nA: I have the same issue. The funny thing is that I can hear the sound of the login screen.\nWhat I also figured out is that VLC works if I configure audio to use ALSA. That makes me think the pulsaudio stuff is broken.\nAfter knowing that I started pulseaudio. I switched configuration, internal device, to Analog Stereo Duplex. It was configured to use Digital Stereo IEC958.\n\nA: I had a similar problem but I after trying many things including uninstalling and reinstalling alsa-base and pulseaudio, what finally worked is the removal of the pulse folder under the .config folder inside my home folder.\n\nA: Funny enough for me in similar situation helps changing display resolution from 1280x720 16x9 to 800x600 4x3. HDMI sound appears in 100% cases! Then I switch resolution back, sound sometimes stays.

Thanks guys!\n\nEDIT:\nInput is still not working (mic/line in).\n\n\nA: The same issue happened on my OS, Ubuntu 16.10, after an upgrade under the utilization of ALSA, Pulseaudio and an external USB Soundcard:\nThe following measures did not fix the malfunction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable ACPI in GRUB Boot Options, which could lead to powered off USB Devices: acpi=off\n\n*Disable ACPI in BIOS\n\n*Configuration of Full Speed and High Speed of USB Port\n\n*Configuration files in /etc/asound.conf and ~/.asoundrc as documented by ALSA\n\n*Utilization of pavucontrol\n\n*Reinstallation of Pulseaudio and ALSA Utils\n\n\nThe main issue is the activated IDLE-Mode in the Pulseaudio Config File: /etc/pulse/default.pa that powers off the USB Soundcard. \nThe following procedure solved the malfunction of the USB-Soundcard:\n1.

Find corresponding driver module for Onboard Soundcard:\nlsmod | grep snd\nGet detailed info about driver:\nmodinfo snd_hda_audio\nRead description of driver, it should correspond to PCI Card, as discovered in first step, under category \"parm\". \nNote: Driver \"snd_usb_audio\" is for USB Device soundcards and \"snd_hda_audio\" for Intel onboard soundcards.\n3. Deactivate Onboard Soundcard Driver by blacklisting it, therefore only one audio driver can correspond to the utilized USB soundcard:\nsudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nAdd following line at end of file, by using the driver as eaxmined in Step 2:\nblacklist snd_hda_intel\n\n\n*\n\n*in my cases the kernel has not to be updated. If the device is not blacklisted in the following step 4, try to update Kernel:\n\n\nsudo update-initramf -u\n4. Check if blacklisting was successfull. Only the second soundcard should appear:\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n1 [CI2            ]: USB-Audio - Steinberg CI2\n                      Yamaha Corporation Steinberg CI2 at usb-0000:00:12.0-2, full speed\n5. Deactivate Idle Mode which is similar to suspend sode for Audio Device, otherwise the USB device disconnects automatically, when no usage by sound application: \nsudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa\nChange following line:\nload-module module-suspend-on-idle\nto \n#load-module module-suspend-on-idle\nReboot\nObservation: It is recommended to install the application \"pavucontrol\" for additional configuration and supervising of current sound configurations.\nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\nI hope this helps others as well.\n", "Q: Permission denied even when run with sudo I have a large 3TB NTFS formatted hard drive in my PC which I use for storage.

I have even rebooted the VM, but it is just not working.\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin yes\nStrictModes yes\n\n\nA: There is no 'root' account available for login by default.  It is locked in a default installation.  You don't state where your install runs from, so I am going to assume it's running from your remote user account on the server.\nYou can enable the root account if you wish, but there's more 'secure' approaches to do this, than just enabling the account.  I've detailed some approaches to gaining root privileges to run an installation file on a system.\n\nThe safe way: Use sudo to temporarily gain root privileges for the application to run as once.\nAssuming this is a file you have to execute, you can run your installer as root by running this command, replacing /path/to/installer with the real path:\nsudo /path/to/installer\n\n\nThe not-as-safe way: Use sudo to drop into a root shell prompt, and execute installation commands.\nRun this command top drop yourself into a root login, and then you can run commands as superuser:\nsudo su -\n\nOnce here, execute the command as you would without sudo:\n/path/to/installer\n\nNote that this is a very dangerous thing - you can literally break your system with this approach if you don't know what you're doing on the command line.\nOnce done, exit the shell and drop back to your unprivileged user.\n\nThe extremely dangerous insecure way: Enable root account by setting a password\n\nWARNING!\nBefore attempting ANY of these commands, be aware that by enabling the root account, and permitting Root Login with \"Yes\" and not \"without-password\" through ssh, if even for just a moment, you are opening your system to brute-force login attempts and other security risks.  If you do this, then AS SOON AS IS LOGICAL you should re-disable the root account.\nEither set PermitRootLogin without-password and configure SSH Key Authentication, or understand that as soon as you are done, you should lock the root account again, and set PermitRootLogin to no or without-password.\n\nThe least secure approach is to enable the root account by setting a password.  You can do this by using this command on your user who has sudo privileges (you don't have to specify 'root' here though):\nsudo passwd\n\nSet a root password (the password will not display, nor will any asterisks, but it is accepting the password), then the root account will be activated.  You will then be able to login to the account, based on your existing SSH settings you stated.\nAs soon as you no longer need the root user, please run this to re-disable and re-lock the root user from your sudo-enabled account:\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nYou should also set PermitRootLogin to no or without-password in your sshd_config as well when you do this.\n", "Q: Updated 16.04 does not work after login - how can I recover? 16.04 (now updated from 15.10, under Win7/VirtualBox 5.0.18 as a guest) starts, login appears, then nothing can be seen but the bare desktop background picture only.\nCan I recover somehow, or return to 15.10 ?\n\nA: I had a similar problem upgrading 14.04 to 16.04 on my desktop machine (hardware), but had the foresight to make a duplicate of the 14.04 partition before upgrading, so I was able to copy the duplicate back, fix the UUID entries in GRUB and fstab, and get back to the same setup I had before upgrading.\nIf you don't have a backup of the old OS (an image of the complete partition is best) there's no way I know to revert from a non-working upgraded install to an older version.

You can use\nEasyBCD to manually rewrite your MBR from Windows. Try to do the install now.\nIf that doesn't work,  since you have made a bootable flash drive, you have the option of using it inside Windows to install Ubuntu alongside Windows just like a normal Windows software. The problem though, is that this mode of installation uses wubi, a relatively simple bootloader and not the better grub. But that shouldn't bother you since you are a beginner and wouldn't require any power user features at the bootloader level.\n\nA: finally i found that the partitions were already created when i installed ubuntu for first time. so i just choosed the option format /sda partitions which showed in that pop up window.

Before I used 14.04 and mounted a a NFS share with the following line in the /etc/fstab\n192.168.178.66:/media/user/drive /media/user/banana nfs rw 0 0\n\nWhat should happen?\nThe nfs share should be mounted on startup into the given location.\nWhat happens?\nBoot takes very long and the nfs share is not mounted. A greyed symbol for the share appears on my desktop. When I click on it it says something like \"Only root can mount\". When I press an arrow during boot I can see the systemd log (I suppose) it says ~ \"Startjob for /media/user/banane (30s/1,31s)\" It wait’s the whole 91s and the it finally boots. Mounting the nfs manually works. But then shutdown does not end. Looking at the systemd output again: \"Stop job for /media/netzwerkfreigabe (30s/2m)\" The shutdown does not end at the given limit. Instead another longer limit appears. At least three times.\nAdditional Information\n\n\n*\n\n*the package nfs-common is installed on the client computer\n\n*the nfs server is a BananaPi running BananianLinux (a modified Debian Jessy)\n\n*I can mount the nfs-share using the same /etc/fstab line from another computer using Xubuntu 14.04\n\n\nAs far as I know systemd is introduced in Ubuntu 16.04. This may be a systemd issues. Should my fstab config work? Do you mount nfs in a different way these days? I found several reports about similar problems of other users at other forums. Should I file a bug?\nThank you for your answer!\n\nA: I found the following solution here. Apparrently, you have to use specific systemd options in fstab.\nservername:/home   /mountpoint/on/client  nfs  noauto,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.device-timeout=10,timeo=14,x-systemd.idle-timeout=1min 0 0\n\n\nA: Had the same problem and have read all the posts on askubuntu.com and elsewhere on it. I finally found a wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/systemd#Remote_filesystem_mounts explaining the issue quite well, except for little changes necessary for Ubuntu 16.04. What was not that clear to me after reading this, was that it seems to be necessary to have both, the entry in fstab (pretty standard) AND the .mount file in /etc/systemd/system.\nEntry in my fstab:\nmyserver:/export/work    /mnt/work       nfs     auto    0       0\n\nThe mount unit file for systemd /etc/systemd/system/mnt-work.mount (mention the naming convention /mnt/work ==> mnt-work.mount\n[Unit]\nDescription=/mnt/work\nWants=network-online.target rpc-statd.service\nAfter=network-online.target rpc-statd.service\n\n[Mount]\nWhat=myserver:/export/work\nWhere=/mnt/work\nType=nfs\nStandardOutput=syslog\nStandardError=syslog\nTimeoutSec=50\n\nAs you might note, I had to change statd.service to rpc-statd.service and network.target to network-online.target (which I don't know if its necessary). \nIn addition, I added a timeout of 50 seconds. Nevertheless, when I switch of networking via hardware switch, shutdown will hang.\nMy problem was, when the fstab entry is missing, the mount unit won't be executed on startup!\n\nA: It took me ages to fix it, and meantime I was locked out of my nfs shares.   I changed the 4th field in /etc/fstab from defaults to user.  The problem is that only superuser can mount the shared files.  Adding user means that anyone can mount files, including nfs. \n\nA: I had the same problem, and found this very useful digitalocean article which gives the correct mount options\nhostname:/path /mount/path nfs auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0\n\n\nA: I had the exact same setup and it just worked for me.  NFS export was on 14.04 and I mounted it using 16.04.  I did it just like I've done older versions (and from what it sounds like, just what you have tried).   Make sure you added the new machine to your exports.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem but it also takes a long time to shutdown.  I'm connecting my desktop to a rasberry pi running NFS:\ntry editing your /etc/fstab on your client machine to:\n192.168.178.66:/media/user/drive /media/user/banana nfs soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 just add user option to the appropriate line in /etc/fstab and try mounting as normal user, it should works (even for cifs mount).\n\nA: [1] Create a file at: \n\n/etc/network/if-up.d/fstab\n\n[2] Add this to it:\n#!/bin/sh\nmount -a\n\n[3] Make the file executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/fstab\n\nFrom this answer: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2392742&p=13795542#post13795542\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 is not providing working suspend or hibernate feature I previously used 14.04 and i used to suspend when ever i am done and need to resume my task later .

In the Unity Launcher bar to the left, I can't get the icon for Eclipse to be anything except a question mark. I have created a .desktop file with the appropriate paths for Exec= and Icon= , and I have made the item executable via chmod. The functionality of the .desktop file is not a problem.

I tried ScottC's answer mentioned here. I created the .desktop file on my desktop location, added the exec path as <eclipse installation directory>/eclipse and icon path as <eclipse installation directory>/icon.xpm and then pinned it to the launcher.

This will make you sad and miss the planetary theming, if left unchanged.\nFor example, Neon for Android should have a green accent:\nhttp://imgur.com/stMvzCQ (use GIMP to convert this PNG to XPM, default alpha).\nYou should never adulter the blue&white Eclipse logo, that is blasphemy. The accent is now agnostic since the planet theme was abandoned. Phobos would have been the perfect name for an Eclipse release ...\n\nA: I just faced the same problem and solved it by changing the name of the Icon name in the desktop file. \nUsing Ubuntu 16.04.3 and Eclipse Oxygen and by looking at the eclipse folder, I saw that the icon has the name 'icon.xpm' , whereas in the desktop file in \n~/.local/share/applications, the name is 'eclipse'.\nSo, I replaced:\nIcon=eclipse\nby:\nIcon=$your_eclipse_path/icon.xpm\n\nand it worked for me.\n\nA: In the sample you have mentioned in the top, the required key \"Name\" is missing.

In this case ubuntu doesn't even detect my media drive.\nIs there any way in which I can read and write from my media drive from ubuntu gnome or linux in general?\nUpdate:\nI can see the drive by using lsblk:\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 111,8G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   350M  0 part \n├─sda2   8:2    0   111G  0 part /media/myusername/F04C0DC34C0D8616\n└─sda3   8:3    0   450M  0 part \nsdb      8:16   0   2,7T  0 disk \n├─sdb1   8:17   0   128M  0 part \n└─sdb2   8:18   0   2,7T  0 part \nsdc      8:32   0 223,6G  0 disk \n├─sdc1   8:33   0     1K  0 part \n├─sdc2   8:34   0 214,7G  0 part /\n└─sdc5   8:37   0   8,9G  0 part [SWAP]\n\nI'm trying to read sdb/sdb2.\nWhen I use sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/myusername/mediadrive\nI get:\nwrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb2,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail or so.\n\nWhen I execute sudo parted -l the output is:\nModel: ATA Samsung SSD 840 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 120GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End    Size   Type     File system  Flags\n 1      1049kB  368MB  367MB  primary  ntfs         boot\n 2      368MB   120GB  119GB  primary  ntfs\n 3      120GB   120GB  472MB  primary  ntfs         diag\n\n\nModel: ATA ST3000DM001-1CH1 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 3001GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                          Flags\n 1      17,4kB  134MB   134MB                Microsoft reserved partition  msftres\n 2      135MB   3001GB  3000GB               Grupo de almacenamiento\n\n\nModel: ATA KINGSTON SV300S3 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdc: 240GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End    Size    Type      File system     Flags\n 2      1049kB  231GB  231GB   primary   ext4            boot\n 1      231GB   240GB  9499MB  extended\n 5      231GB   240GB  9499MB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\n\n\nA: Storage Spaces are based on a new proprietary file system from Microsoft called ReFS (resilient file system)\nAt the time of writing, there is no Open Source software that allows to mount this kind of file system, the only option right now is to use proprietary software:\nReFS for Linux by Paragon Software\nNote: I am not affiliated with Paragon Software in any way, I am just stating the facts.\n\nA: Yes :\nsudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/myusername/mount-point\n\nOR\nsudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/$USER/mount-point\n\nFirst use this command to show your hard lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk\n├─sda1   8:1    0   100G  0 part /media/shu/temp\n├─sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 part\n├─sda3   8:3    0 190.8G  0 part /\n├─sda4   8:4    0 638.9G  0 part\n└─sda5   8:5    0   1.9G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   0   1.8T  0 disk\n├─sdb1   8:17   0   128M  0 part\n├─sdb2   8:18   0 931.5G  0 part\n└─sdb3   8:19   0 931.5G  0 part /media/shu/movie\n\nthen go to /media/$USER \nNotice : $USER = your username.

It's not a matter of detecting and mounting it, it's a matter of reading Microsoft's proprietary virtual file system. It is a similar problem as if you had a LVM2 volume which you are trying to open from Windows, you can see it's there, but reading it is another matter. Also, because you don't know how it works, I highly recommend not mounting it or otherwise poking it; especially if this isn't your computer. \n\nA: Type \nsudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/winfiles\n\nnot \"mount /sdb/sdb2\" and not \"mount /dev/sdb2/\"(sdb2 is treated as a file not a directory).\nIf this gives you an error, sdb2 doesn't exist or anything, type \ncd /dev\nls\n\nand check if a file named sdb2 is in the folder \"/dev\"\n", "Q: Why doesn't my disk get shared via NFS? I have had no problems getting NFS to work until now.

Mounted file systems are not re-exported automatically. You must explicitly export the mounted filesystem in /etc/exports on the server:\n/location/disk           clientMachine(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)\n\nDon't forget to sudo exportfs -ra on the server, then unmount and re-mount /location on the client.\nSee also: this unix.stackexchange question\n", "Q: Can you run Web Dev packages on aquaris m10 I'm very tempted to buy the new Aquaris M10 instead of a new laptop. Can you run packages like PHP Storm/xampp/git/php on there? Does it have a fully operational terminal? Would the processor be able to handle these type of packages without grinding to a halt?\n\nA: I don't have a high enough reputation to add a comment, but I thought I would share in an aswer my current experience.\nI am a web developer. I have been using ubuntu for many years and am comfortable with apt-get and a little configuration. \nI bought my Aquaris M10 with the purpose of using it as a travel computer. The idea is that it would be handy to use for browsing and videos as a tablet but still enable me to develop with Ruby on Rails. So far it is frustrating me that it is not easier to set up basic dev tools.\nThe problem is that you can't use apt-get directly but have to do some chroot magic to install .deb packages to work with the ARM architecture.\nRecommended way to install regular(cli) .deb packages on Ubuntu Phone?\nMy current plan is to wait for the ugrade to ubuntu 16.04 before attempting this as I gather things will be easier then.\nYes, terminal is functional but out of the box you are very limitted to which system files you can edit and the the overall experience I found is not highly responsive. I don't know if the responsiveness is a problem that can be fixed. top shows the load average is generally between 10 and 12. That would bring my desktop to its knees but perhaps ARM works differently.\nIt is thrilling to be using the first ubuntu tablet off the shelf. I would never have bought a non linux tablet. But if I could go back in time I would either have bought a netbook, which would have performed miles better for less money, or I would have held off until the next version. The tablet is working well as a touch device, no problems adding blue tooth keyboard and mouse, but I was expecting more from the desktop experience.\nI am optimistic it will get there very soon. I love the concept of phone/tablet and computer in one.\nEdit:\nThere is a useful help page for installing packages with Libertine here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Libertine\n", "Q: Notebook display not detected after upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 I have an Asus N55S notebook with Nvidia Gefore GT555M and an external Samsung monitor connected via HDMI.

The solution for me was to remove gnome-keyring, delete identities from ssh-agent, and reboot.\nsudo apt-get autoremove gnome-keyring\nssh-add -D\n\nThen all my keys started to work perfectly.\nTemporary solution without uninstalling keyring\nIf you want to keep the gnome-keyring on the local computer and you have the agent refused operation error, use:\neval `ssh-agent -s`\nssh-add\n\nor use SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0 ssh your-server.\nPermanent solution without uninstalling keyring\nIf you can, gnome-keyring is compatible with 4096 bit RSA key, so just generate a new key with:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/your-key-name -b 4096 -v -C root\n\nUpload public key to the server:\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-key-name.pub root@12.34.56.78\n\nAdd ssh key to the agent:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/your-key-name\n\nThis should work without any additional hacks and gnome-keyring can remain installed.\n(The -C [username] is optional, but required by providers like Google Cloud.)\n\nA: Simple Solution\nI had the same problem on Ubuntu 18.04. That's all about client-side private key permissions.\n$ ssh root@192.168.1.1\nsign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation\n\nThe file permissions were too open (0644).\nThe following command solved it:\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nA: Adding comment as I had the same issue with ed25519 keys. The issue is indeed gnome-keyring. To fix this I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unchecked ssh-key-agent (gnome-keyring) in \"startup applications\"\n\n*Killed off the ssh-agent and gnome agent: (killall ssh-agent ; \nkillall gnome-keyring-daemon)\n\n*Re-started the daemon: (eval ssh-agent -s)\n\n*Add your key: $ ssh-add id_ed25519 Enter passphrase for id_ed25519: \nIdentity added: id_ed25519\n\n*Profit!!\n\n\nA: It's late 2018, and this bug, or variations of it, still plague Xubuntu 16.04, and more than likely other flavors of Xenial. I would not be surprised if it exists in 18.04 as well! It's been around in some form since 2009, and Karmic Koala. Has affected Redhat, Debian and Ubuntu. Don't take my word for it, see the public bugtrackers:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/470456\nAnd at that bug, you also find listings for the other 3:\nReferences:\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=523322\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=508286\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=576700\nIn my case, the most obvious symptom was inability to use ssh keys with passphrases. It may affect ones without as well, since the malfunction prevents ssh keys from loading at all! And I had no permissions problems, it was all gnome-keyring. My keys (yes it refused several, for different SSH servers!) permissions were all 600 (rw for owner, nothing for group or other) as stated in many answers about that. So nothing I could change there.\nIn Xubuntu, there is a way to disable startup items. Usually also possible in Unity/Gnome/KDE, but I don't have those installed, so can't give specific steps. Not sure of other desktops. Rather than disable SSH agent, GPG agent and other items from Gnome that cause this, and other related bugs, I turned off all Gnome startup items. May be overkill or not an option for some, but SSH is back to working flawlessly on the next reboot!\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Whisker Main Menu -> Settings -> Session and Startup.\n\n*Click the Advanced tab, last one on the right.\n\n*Uncheck (turn off) Launch Gnome Services on startup.\n\n*Close and reboot. Logging out may do it too, but reboot should for sure.\n\n\nScreenshot of GUI described above:\n\nSo, since I gave my fix above, I do hope someone will fix it.\nUbuntu has provably failed to squash it for good, since there are lots of tickets for several releases which claim it is fixed, and more that say \"regression\", it's back.\nDebian probably wants to punt (wash their hands of it) because it's not them, upstream is Gnome. \nRedhat probably has a fix only available to paying customers. Because, historically, Redhat is the single biggest employer of paid Gnome developers, which is generous at first glance. Until you realize that means they have financial incentive never to put fixes like this into the free versions, to keep selling Redhat subscriptions.\nGnome is probably the ones who can fix it upstream easiest, and then the others can test and package, without writing a line of code themselves. But the tickets I read say the package has languished for years without an official maintainer! And the two people who voluntarily do so now (thank you) are almost as busy designing a replacement. Why not fix a flat tire even if it takes a year (it's been a decade!) instead of reinventing the wheel first?!\n\nA: After upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04 I got the same error sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation. Turns out it was caused by the permissions of the ssh key being too open.\nThe following command fixed the problem for me\nchmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa\n\nA: \nssh-add\n\nworks for me.\nBut be sure \n\nssh-agent\n\nis running.\n\nA: In my case the issue was caused by GNOME Keyring. To disable gnome-keyring's SSH capabilities without outright removing it (which breaks a lot of things), follow these instructions:\ncp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop ~/.config/autostart\necho Hidden=true >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop\n\nand restart the session. Now you can run ssh-agent without gnome-keyring interfering.\n\nA: My problem was that during update from Debian Stretch to Debian Buster I was forced to move to systemd (due to losing access to shutdown/reboot buttons in XFCE), and it stopped working with same error.\nFinally found Debian bug #851440 with solution: \napt-get install dbus-user-session. Apparently it is needed if you want to use gpg-agent (used for OpenPGP smartcard, for example) and pinentry-gnome3 under systemd (it wasn't needed under sysvinit, and system upgrade didn't install it)\n\nA: I tried a couple of things, among others ssh-add, resetting SSH (deleting .ssh/ on the server, and such, but no luck. So it turned out I just had to sleep over it for one night. It helped! Why? I guess the ssh-agent running on the server had something in its cache which was refreshed later that night with the now proper values. Anyhow, it now works like a charm. To wrap up, it did this (Ubuntu 16.04 on localhost, 14.04 on server).\n# on local host:\n$ ssh-keygen\n# (yes, overwrite the default file, and let the passphrase be empty)\n$ ssh-copy-id ***.***.*.**\n# (insert proper server IP address)\n# now test\n$ ssh ***.***.*.**\n# this should have erected in .ssh/ on the server:\n# -rw------- 1 *** *** 2000 aug.  11 09:55 authorized_keys\n# no other magic going on! :)\n\n\nA: I ended up dropping my known hosts file and it worked. Had to put in a password again, but it finally accepted the right password. It was after a new install. \n\nA: If adding SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0 before ssh command helps, then it is gnome keyring fault. Except provided solutions and problems, issue may be related with passphrase. If you have passphrase for key then gnome keyring asks it when you login for first time and if you enter empty by fault or unexpectedly close window, gnome assumes it as empty passphrase and remembers it forever. Nothing helps to be prompted again for passphrase. To solve open ssh keyring app and go to Login section under Passwords category. Find record corresponding for problematic key and enter to Properties and enter correct passphrase.\n\nA: There is another cause of this which is not in any answer yet: the PEM format for the key file stopped being the default for ssh-keygen before Ubuntu moved to a gnome-keyring-daemon that supports the new RFC4716 format.\nIf you generate a new key, or add/remove a passphrase from your key, it may break. The key is using ssh-keygen -m PEM before whatever other operation you need to run. For example, you can convert back to the old format by using ssh-keygen -m PEM -p and entering the old passphrase as the new passphrase (which would be empty for no passphrase).\n\nA: If you're a KeepassXC user you might be interested in that GitHub post\nThere Lgmrszd answered:\n\nCan confirm this bug. It happens if \"Require user confirmation..\" checkbox enabled, after disabling it and restarting keepassxc it works fine.\n\nI hope that can resolve that special case for some of you.\n", "Q: installing metasploit i wanna download metasploit.. i followed as specified and got error.. help me out-\nsudo msfupdate\n[*]\n[*] Attempting to update the Metasploit Framework...\n[*]\n\n[*] Checking for updates via git\n[*] Note: Updating from bleeding edge\nfatal: unable to connect to github.com:\ngithub.com[0: 192.30.252.130]: errno=Connection timed out\n\n[*] Attempting to add remote 'upstream' to your local git repository.\nfatal: remote upstream already exists.\n[*] Added remote 'upstream' to your local git repository.\nHEAD is now at d3e5dff whitespace\nAlready on 'master'\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nfatal: unable to connect to github.com:\ngithub.com[0: 192.30.252.129]: errno=Connection timed out\n\nmerge: upstream/master - not something we can merge\n[*] Updating gems...\nDon't run Bundler as root.

I installed Ubuntu in UEFI mode, but i not sure, that windows installed in UEFI. \nScreen shot of gparted\nI created Windows bootable usb (FAT32) with unetbootin + gparted and tried to restore loader: create a new NTFS partition (sda2) and use many variants of restoring: standard MS repair startup tool (doesn`t help), commands \nbootsect.exe /nt60 all \nbootrec.exe /fixboot\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\nbootrec.exe /RebuildBcd\n\nsome operations with grub: update, adding items to menu, and others.\nI am little confused. And now I have next situation: when I switch on the laptop error message by windows loader are displayed. And I can boot Ubuntu only by choosing it in boot list(f9).  What should I do?\nupd: boot info\n\nA: Your configuration is peculiar. It looks like you installed Windows 8.1 yourself in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, then installed Ubuntu in EFI/UEFI mode. That's not a happy combination; it's almost always best to boot both OSes in the same mode (BIOS or EFI), not to mix modes. Broadly speaking, there are three ways to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a BIOS-mode Ubuntu boot loader -- This is likely to be the easiest way to fix your problem. The Boot Repair tool can probably do this, or you can install grub-pc and then do a sudo grub-install /dev/sda.\n\n*Convert to GPT and install an EFI-mode Windows boot loader -- See this blog post for the general procedure to do this. Note that when you're done with the Windows BIOS/MBR-to-EFI/GPT conversion, you may need to re-register GRUB with the firmware. Again, Boot Repair may be able to do the trick. If you go this route, I recommend you disable your CSM so as to avoid the extra complication in your boot path that's created by having it active. (This complication created your problem to begin with.)\n\n*Keep your mixed modes -- Many EFIs enable you to switch between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode booting by using their built-in boot managers (typically accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key early in the boot process, but details vary from one system to another). Alternatively, you could install my rEFInd boot manager in Ubuntu and edit its refind.conf file: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. Then, when rEFInd comes up, you should be able to boot either Ubuntu or Windows. Either way you do it, this approach assumes that you've got a working Windows BIOS-mode boot loader. That may already be the case, but I can't be sure of that.\n\n\nGetting any of these options to work is likely to require at least some trial-and-error experimentation because of system-to-system differences in how EFIs boot and because there may be unexpected quirks that might complicate your particular setup. Lots of things can go wrong when you reconfigure your boot loaders, so you may well end up posting back again with a follow-up question.\nNo matter which route you take, I recommend you download and prepare the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd. (You can get images for both from the rEFInd downloads page.) You should be able to use rEFInd to boot into Ubuntu no matter what the partition table looks like, so having rEFInd on an external medium can serve as an emergency boot tool if something goes wrong as you make your changes.\nFor more on why you've got a problem, see my page on the CSM. Note, however, that my page is written with a configuration in which Windows is in EFI mode and Ubuntu gets installed in BIOS mode in mind, since that's the more common error to make. Yours is the reverse of that. The basic principles are the same, though.\n", "Q: How do I restore a Virtualbox VM from backup? (qcow) I have backed up the contents of the directory \"VirtualBox VMs\" and now I am trying to restore the states of my virtual machines by copying the backed up files, back.\nNow when I select \"Machine\" -> \"Add\" and select the qcow file of my VM, I receive the following error:\n\nI have tried running\nvboxmanage internalcommands sethduuid \"home/user/VirtualBox VMs/ubuntu32-alt-text/ubuntu32-alt-text.qcow\"\n\nbut I'm getting the following error:\n`VBoxManage: error: Cannot set a new UUID: VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`\n\nHow do I properly restore a Virtualbox VM?\nI'm runnung VirtualBox 5.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 (amd64).\n\nA: Hi Nickolai I found the same suggestion and got the same result as you:\nvboxmanage internalcommands sethduuid gave\nCannot set a new UUID: VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED\n\nIf we're restoring a VM, we should first remove the original and its media from inventory.\nSelect the VM then use Machine -> Remove from the menu.

Both OS's are running fine but Ubuntu created a 5th partition (very small) and the one I created with about 60gb seems to be empty still.  Can I delete that partition?  Will the balance go to the C:\\ drive? \nShould I start all over and let Ubuntu create the partitions?

Creating partitions for Ubuntu using Windows tools is a Bad Idea (note the i-caps)! As often as not, that results in converting the disk from a regular plain MBR setup into an LDM configuration, which Ubuntu can't use directly, so that then creates a need to fix the problem using third-party Windows tools. All this juggling also increases the risk of damage to the disk. In any event, you seem to have avoided that trap.\nGiven your partition table (which I've reformatted for legibility -- what you posted was reformatted by the forum software into a virtually-unreadable form), your partitions seem to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unknown, but probably needed by Windows\n\n*Windows boot\n\n*Unknown\n\n*Extended -- do not delete!\n\n*Ubuntu root (/)\n\n*Ubuntu swap\n\n\nYou'll have to investigate for yourself what partition #3 is; that can't be determined from parted output alone. If it's an empty partition, you can delete it and expand/move other partitions to fill the resulting empty space. There are quite a few questions and answers here about how to perform such tasks, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to extend my root (/) partition?\n\n*How to resize partitions?\n\n*How do I resize partitions using command line without using a GUI on a server?\n\n*How can I increase a partition's size?\n\n*How can I resize NTFS partition in GParted?\n\nA: I see that the 60 gb partition is lying dormant. Since it is immediately after the C: Windows partition, it is possible to extend the windows partition and merge the 60 gb to it. I would recommend you to do this in Windows. Boot into Windows and open disk management. Right-click on the C: drive and select extend partition. Then follow the wizard to extend the partition.\nYou could follow these steps.\n", "Q: How do I completely disable shadows on xfce panel indicators and applications?

So first go to the BIOS (look which Fxx key is the \"BIOS-entry\" key on your model of computer) and look around. There may be Allow USB boot option somewhere. If there is -> enable it. Than search for Boot order menu. You should set the \"boot from USB\" before \"boot from HD\". Make sure that you have the bootable USB pluged in before entering to BIOS. My machine for example, didn't give me \"boot from USB\" option if there was no bootable USB plugged in. If you see somewhere Fast boot option (or similar) -> disable it.

I had Windows 7 and shrunk the partition, creating a new one (plus swap) for Ubuntu, then I installed Ubuntu. I am enjoying it so much I'm considering using it a lot more than I expected. The problem is the Ubuntu partition could be bigger (30Gb on a 1Tb hard drive), which is OK to a certain extent seeing as most of my Windows partition is full of games.\nSo my question is: can I safely shrink my windows partition, then expand my Ubuntu partition, copy over files and repeat until I'm satisfied? (probably until I use Windows only for games that don't work on Ubuntu) Also, if I finally decide to get rid of Windows, can I just remove it and expand the Ubuntu partition so it takes up the whole hard drive? If so, what do I need to worry about?\nThank you.\n\nA: Short Answer\nYes, your plan is workable\nMedium Answer\nThere's no such thing as \"safe\" (in an absolute way) when dealing with partition-resizing operations. Your plan, in particular, will necessarily involve moving the start point of at least one partition, and that's always a bit risky. Be sure to have adequate backups before moving or resizing partitions.\nLong Answer\nInstead of expanding the current partition, you may want to consider creating a separate /home partition for use in the space you create when you shrink the Windows partition, as described here:\nHow to Create a seperate partition for home after accidentally installing ubuntu under single / partition\nThis will enable you to skip at least one round of partition-moving/resizing-from-the-start (assuming Ubuntu comes after Windows now), and it provides several other advantages.\nYou might even consider using a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) setup, at least for new space like your /home partition. The immediate advantage of LVM for you is that you can expand it without moving anything. For instance, suppose you end up doing three rounds of shrinking the Windows partition and moving the space to Ubuntu. With LVM, in each of these steps, you would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the Windows partition\n\n*Create a new partition in that space\n\n*Add that new partition to the LVM\n\n*Expand the /home logical volume within the LVM\n\n\nSteps #2-4 are all quick and low in risk, compared to moving and resizing a conventional partition, which is much slower and riskier.\nThe drawback to this approach is that the resulting filesystem will be fragmented, which will degrade performance, at least if it's on a conventional hard disk. This shouldn't be a big deal if your LVM consumes just a couple of partitions, but it could be a problem if you go through half a dozen rounds of resizing and re-allocating.\nAnother option you might look into, at least if you know you want to re-allocate a significant chunk of space right away, is to back up all the files you want to move to another physical disk, delete them from the original, do your re-partitioning in one big chunk, and then restore the files from the backup. This has the advantage of doing it all at once, which will have benefits whether you use LVM or conventional partitions. If you don't currently have enough backup storage to handle this task, GO GET IT NOW!!!! Backups are NOT a luxury.\n", "Q: KDEConnect Indicator in Ubuntu 16.04 does not show up I have installed kdeconnect along with the indicator and I have noticed that the indicator does not work in ubuntu 16.04 with unity.

Pinch to zoom doesn't seem to work as far as I can tell (and I could be wrong) but I don't care for it anyway (I never use it on my Macbook). Two finger scroll works better on 16.04 than it does on Win 10, especially because it doesn't do weird stuff Win 10 does like go to the switcher or the window background sometimes because it thought you swiped with 3 or 4 fingers instead of scrolling with 2 fingers.\nAs far as your Spotify question goes, I can't help - I've never used Spotify (I am pretty entrenched in the Google ecosystem). Sound works fine, I can play Youtube videos or listen to music on Google Play and it works as well as it does on Win 10. Casting music and video to my Chromecast works perfectly.\nI would suggest that you put 16.04 on a USB stick and boot it up on your Zenbook and see how it works for you. I did that for a few days and I found it to be more pleasant to use than Win 10 was (the thing where it would sometimes go to the background window on a 2 finger scroll was making me crazy!) so I installed it dual boot with Win 10. So far the only reason I have found to need to boot Win 10 was to sync my Garmin watch. Once I finished that I went right back to 16.04\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: error large bars and toolbars in eclipse? this is my eclipse 4.2 GUI, in Numix theme:\n\nand in Ambiance theme(default)\n\nAs title, Tabs and tool bars of my Eclipse too large. so, how do i fix it?\nplease don't tell me change to default theme, because i like it\n\nA: You may have to wait when a theme update will come out from Numix.

Given an image, how do I use imagemagick to resize it to a specific aspect ratio? for example, to an aspect ratio of 2:1\n\nA: Two things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple resizing with or without aspect ratio conversion\n\n*Cropping with aspect ration conversion\n\n\nI address each in turn:\n1. Simple resizing with or without aspect ratio conversion\nimagemagick by default will maintain the preexisting aspect ratio of an image during conversions. Using this test image:\n\nwhich conveniently has the dimensions of 100x100 an attempt to resize to 300x150 with this syntax will silently fail:\nconvert test.png -resize 300x150 300_test.png\n\nand will produce a 150x150 image:\n\nTo force imagemagickto actually produce your 2:1 aspect ratio image the following slightly different syntax is required:\nconvert test.png -resize 300x150\\! distort.png\n\nAnd this achieves a 2:1 aspect ratio, with distortion of the original image of course:\n\n2. Cropping with aspect ration conversion\nIf you would prefer to simply and automatically crop an image to a specified aspect ratio the easiest way is to use one of Fred's ImageMagick Scripts: 'Aspectcrop'. Usage on our test image is simply:\n./aspectcrop -a 2:1 test.png Fred_wins.png\n\nand the resulting image has been successfully cropped to a 2:1 ratio:\n\nThe other option to be manipulated is -g gravity which defines which part of the image is used for cropping. The default is center, all options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*center (c)\n\n*north (n)\n\n*south (s)\n\n*east (e)\n\n*west (w)\n\n*northwest (nw)\n\n*northeast (ne)\n\n*southwest, (sw)\n\n*southeast (se)\n\n\nSo to give an example of this using north:\n./aspectcrop -a 2:1 -g n test.png north.png\n\nThe results are:\n\nIf you needed to use this script for a batch load of images in a single directory you could use a bash 'for' loop. First place the script correctly and set it to executable:\nsudo mv aspectcrop /usr/local/bin\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/aspectcrop\n\nThis makes it a lot easier to use the script. Then run the 'for' loop from within a directory of images:\nfor i in *.png\ndo \naspectcrop -a 2:1 -g n \"$i\" \"${i%.png}_cropped.png\"\ndone\n\nThis loop can be varied according to the type of input and output files, different locations etc. You could also produce a similar syntax that will search recursively for images. Lots of possibilities...\nI think that is all pretty cool :)\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Imagemagick: Resize or Scaling (General Techniques)\n\n*Fred's ImageMagick Scripts: 'Aspectcrop'\n\nA: Here's a script for all jpg in folder to check 4:3 aspect.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nEXTENSION=\"*.jpg\"\n\nfor file in $EXTENSION\ndo\n        currAspect=$(identify -format \"%[fx:w/h]\" \"$file\")\n        roundFloat=$(printf '%.*f\\n' 3 \"$currAspect\")\n\n        if [ $roundFloat != 1.333 ]\n                then\n                        echo \"name: $file aspect: $currAspect rounded: $roundFl$\n                fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Failed to start saned.service: Unit saned.service is masked I'm trying to set up a wireless scanning server.\nI'm following this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SaneDaemonTutorial but I'm having issues at the time to run sudo service saned restart where I get\n\nFailed to start saned.service: Unit saned.service is masked.\n\nI have even tried to do systemctl unmask saned.service && systemctl start saned.servicebut I stills echoes the same error.\nThanks\n\nA: I am not expert about systemd internal workings, but I was able to connect to scanner in this setup:\ncomputer_A  ---network--->  computer_B with SANE  ---USB---  scanner\n\nafter running this (on computer_B):\nsudo systemctl start saned.socket\n\nIt is probably the right way of doing it, judging by description here:\n- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159462/what-is-systemds-target-service-and-socket\nAnd to make it start automatically on startup:\nsudo systemctl enable saned.socket\n\n\nA: I copy some answers from this page:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-backends/+bug/1577137\nPost number 13:\n\nI just received some updates:\nlibudev1 (229-4ubuntu5) to 229-4ubuntu6\nlibudev1:i386 (229-4ubuntu5) to 229-4ubuntu6 \npython3-urllib3 (1.13.1-2) to 1.13.1-2ubuntu0.16.04.1 \nsystemd (229-4ubuntu5) to 229-4ubuntu6\nsystemd-sysv (229-4ubuntu5) to 229-4ubuntu6\nudev (229-4ubuntu5) to 229-4ubuntu6\nXsane just works fine now (without any configuration).

This is a tmpfs, and so is stored in shared memory.  Normally it should only contain a very small amount of data, mainly device nodes that provide a file interface to kernel drivers, so something is incorrectly filling it up.

The following commands installed the mate variants of gedit (pluma) and eog (eom)\nsudo apt-get install pluma eom\nsudo apt-get --purge remove gedit eog\n#sudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nThe packages can be looked up in the package mate-desktop-environment (thx to @ErkinAlpGüney). The application galculator as a replacement for gnome-calculator didn't meet my expectations. Still open is the file open dialog, but I'm afraid that one is not easy to replace.\nUpdate: still not happy with this solution: pluma seems to be based on an older version which opens the search dialog when pressing Ctrl+F instead of using the little overlay search box which allows to crawl through the results using Up and Down keys\n", "Q: How do I configure the low battery notifications? My laptop routinely runs between full and critical charge a few times over the course of a day (yes, it's old). Before I updated to 16.04, Cinnamon used to notify me at:\n\n\n*\n\n*20%, then again at\n\n*10%, then again at\n\n*7%, then again at\n\n*5%, then finally\n\n*\"The battery has reached a critical level. The computer will hibernate very soon unless it is plugged in.\" at 2% or so. (at which point it continues to function for another 15 minutes.)\nWhen I installed 15.10 and obliterated Unity in favour of Cinnamon, I didn't (knowingly) change anything related to this (or know it was possible).\nSome configurations were reset during my system-wide upgrade, including the ones related to these power notifications. This answer lets me set just two notifications, one for critical and one for action, but I clearly remember having the five notifications mentioned above each time as if it was yesterday (because it was, ha-ha).\nAs I said above, I didn't conciously install any external programs for this, so while I'm aware I could write a shell script which just continually polls the sys entry with the battery percentage and notifies at given times, I'm also convinced it was a default behaviour of Ubuntu / Cinnamon (both of which I still use).\nCan I get my 5 notifications back, or should I go with the shell (or other) script?\n\nA: The way I have my notifications set up is via script that launches in /etc/rc.local file on every boot. Simply place the full path into that file and call it like so:\n/home/USERNAME/bin/batmon.sh &\n\nWhat it will do is that it will continuously echo to GUI and to command line that \"hey, your battery is draining\" till you plug in AC source. \nThe script relies on couple of things : having correct battery name ( mine is BAT1 and the file we want is /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/uevent) and the presence of on_ac_power script, which does come with every default Ubuntu flavor ( i don't know about Kubuntu or Xubuntu or others)\nThe source code for the script is located on my git  https://github.com/SergKolo/sergrep/blob/master/batmon.sh\nFeel free to modify the script to your liking , maybe tune the delay time. I've set mine to 30 seconds in sleep function, but you can change it to minute (60 seconds) or more.\n", "Q: Dell XPS 13 9350 (2016) 16.04 upgrade nosound Just upgraded my Dell XPS13 (9350, 2016 model) to 16.04.

I would like to have Linux computer work similar to that. I was wondering if it was possible to have something similar using Linux. \nWhat I would like to see is when I boot my machine into the command-line, and not into a GUI but have graphical resources available. So when I type say: Firefox, the program, and its graphical interface be made available. When I exit Firefox it returns to the command-line. If I need to browse the file system say I typed: XFE or whatever manager is being used and it come up and allow me to browse the folder, and when I exit then it return to the command-line again. So the ability to run, manage and use programs without having to use a GUI but have graphics available. \nIt would be nice to have all this geared toward programming. So at the BASH command-line, have the ability to call up a compiler environment IDE and just start writing programs without being distracted by a desktop environment. \nAnd if more than one graphical program is running then have a tabbed window manager I guess. Is this feasible or am I dreaming?\n\nA: Look into using a window manager like FVWM2, rather than a \"desktop\".  You can configure it to open just one (or more) xterms on boot, can run any graphical application such a web browser from the command line, aren't bothered by desktop stuff like \"system tray\" or icons for everything, but can add any bits of that you might find to actually be useful.  (In my case, that's a pager window for multiple screens, and a Conky load monitor.)\n\nA: This is very possible. \nFirst your need to disable graphical boot. Then you want \"Single User Mode\" (warning there are some pretty extreme security risks with this), finally you need to address what to do when you want to run a GUI. \nSee How do I boot into single-user mode from GRUB?\nEssentially you add the option single to your GRUB boot config.  You can do this in your /etc/default/grub file to make the changes permanent. \nSee How do I disable X at boot time so that the system boots in text mode?\nEssentially you add text to your options in /etc/default/grub\nThis will give you a single user, text only environment. Next up is using the GUI. The program you want to run is startx\nYou would run\nstartx /path/to/executable\nThe problem is that you probably want a window manager of some kind. I would suggest twm your your needs. \nsudo apt-get install twm\nThen to run commands, I would say run startx then head back to your console (CTRL+ALT+F1) and do something like export DISPLAY=:0. Now when ever you your a GUI application from the command line it will launch in the \"Graphics Side\" which you can get to with Ctrl+Alt+F7 (usually). \nIf you like that setup you can even automate the setup of it with a script. \nThat it, that's as close as your going to get, with out a lot of work. \n\nA: I think you can get what you want using a Tiling Window Manager, like i3 or xmonad. There are other minimalistic window managers with similar functionality. i3 and xmonad are both in Ubuntu repositories, so they are easy to install, and then you can select them in your login screen.\n\n\nA: I like ratpoison for what you are trying to do. I wont post a screenshot because you can't tell the difference from a screenshot of xterm (or whatever application you are running). In its standard configuration it displays one window full screen. You can split it to display multiple windows, but for most of my daily use I don't. If you start a terminal emulator from your .ratpoisionrc file you get a prompt almost as soon as you log in. It is inspired by gnu screen, and the only concept that they missed was detachable and shared sessions (but vnc fills that gap nicely).\n\nA: I am afraid that you missing the main difference between modern computing environments and those of the C-64 era.  Home computers of the C-64 era were single user, single process systems, and did not share the computers resources with other processes.  This quite simply means that when you would run a program on your C-64 that was a graphical program, it would reconfigure your computers hardware to be in 'graphics' mode and then your running program would handle all of the graphical output, and user input from the mouse and keyboard itself.\nModern computers and its software, by contrast, are multi user, multi process, but not only this, modern software depends on shared libraries, for example Firefox relies on the GTK windowing library, and that in turn relies on other lower level libraries.  So in order for Firefox to run, it depends on a whole stack of software and configuration.  \nBecause there is so much underlying software, this makes it more efficient to stay within a graphical environment once it starts up, rather than to load up the graphical environment for Firefox, then shut it down, then start up the graphical environment for another program, so forth and so on.\nYou can quite simply start and run any Linux GUI program from a terminal (console) window, so I would advise you to pick yourself a simple graphical desktop environment, perhaps Enlightenment or Openbox, and just run everything from a terminal / xterm window.\n\nA: I think you can get what you want without throwing away the desktop.  As other answers have covered, you will likely get better performance with the desktop running anyways and there are technical reasons running linux like an older OS wouldn't really work.  \nI am going to use gnome as my example workflow because it's what I know, but I would guess other desktop environments would also support similar functionality.  In gnome 3 you can have a workspace (or multiple) with with a full screen terminal that has the same look and feel as running in command line only mode.  The fact that the gnome desktop is running in the background is irrelevant.\nThen, using a window manager (such as the one discussed in this SO question) to control which workspace new windows are created on, you can force each new window to be placed on its own workspace.  If you are willing to move windows yourself when they are created, then you don't need any software beyond gnome.  Gnome 3 supports automatic workspaces, so as you open/close windows on the bottommost workspace new workspaces will automatically created/deleted for them.  Then you can just use ctrl + alt + arrow to quickly move between them.  When you close a window the workspace it was on is automatically deleted, and the two workspaces on each side move together.  All you ever see are the windows you have open and the terminal.\n\nA: Install Xvfb:\napt-get install xvfb\n\nRun:\n/usr/bin/Xvfb :1 &\nexport DISPLAY=:1\n\nthen run any graphical software you like headless.\n\nA: Alternatives\nFramebuffer mode\nThere are some programs which are capable of running in framebuffer mode. Framebuffer mode allows an application have the screen all to itself, allowing the application to draw whatever it wants on the screen pixel-by-pixel. Not all programs support it, but there are a few which do.\nFramebuffer mode doesn't require an X Server (such as X.org in case of current Ubuntu versions, or in the near future perhaps Mir or Wayland depending on which one becomes more popular), or any window manager/desktop environment to be started. This should give you a faster text to graphics mode switching (and back), especially as on (most?) modern Linux distros and graphics drivers the Alt-F[1-6] consoles are rendered using framebuffer mode anyway.\n\"Text User Interface\" (TUI)\nSome programs which are normally command line-only support using a mouse via gpm. On Ubuntu, all you need to do is just install the package gpm and it should work straight away without any configuration or even reboot necessary (IIRC). Once gpm is installed, your mouse pointer will be shown as a block-style text cursor and you may use the mouse as normal to click at the elements of the UI. You may also highlight text and use copy and paste.\nIf you want to go a step further, there is even a \"window manager\" which allows you to run multiple terminal applications on the same text mode \"desktop\".\n\nNon-exhaustive list of programs supporting framebuffer mode\n\n\n*\n\n*mc (Midnight Commander) - file manager\n\n*Links/Links 2, Netsurf - web browsers\n\n*fbi - image viewer\n\n*fbgs (related to fbi, part of the same suite), fbpdf - PDF viewer\n\n*mplayer, fbff (ffmpeg based) - audio/video playback\n\n\nA: I agree with Eduar, you probably want a Tiling/Dynamic Window Manager (WM).\nBut no-one's directly addressed:\n\nWhat I would like to see is when I boot my machine into the command-line\n\nCurrently you should boot into a Display Manager (DM) where you login.\nSo you have two options, boot into a shell or a console DM.\nIf you have no DMs set up then you will by default log into a shell,\nthis will give you a login prompt of username then password,\nif you enter the correct credentials then you'll log into your default shell.\nI use this and the following is roughly my average startup 'process':\nArch Linux 4.1.5-1-ARCH (tty1)\n\nlocalhost login: Joe\nPassword: \n$ startx\n\nIf you want to have a DM, but a console one then you'll have to install and configure it.\nArch's wiki currently says there are three console DMs being: CDM, Console TDM and nodm.\nUbuntu uses LightDM by default, so you may have to remove it.\nBut as someone who currently doesn't have a DM I would recommend keeping with your current DM,\nand just change your WM.\nIt's tedious having to type startx and from memory making it automatically execute correctly was annoying to setup.\n\nA: startx and xinit can both be handed an initial client to start with. The following command:\nstartx /usr/bin/firefox\n\nwill spin up an xserver on the TTY you are currently working on, and start a single instance of firefox in something like full screen.\nYou can switch to other tty's to avoid having to bring down the firefox session just to get back to the console, or to bring up other clients there. You might have to specify a lot of options to make this look nice for your monitor since you won't have the desktop environment doing some of that configuration for you.\nYou should be aware that some xclients don't work nicely outside of window managers or desktop environments. There's no DE providing window decorations, and no WM listening for MOD key combos, so if they don't provide a graphical way to quit you will have to kill the process (or X) from another TTY.\nNormally the initial client people use with X is a desktop environment or window manager which is just a special kind of client that launches and embeds other clients in addition to displaying its own window.\n\nA: You can quickly switch to a command line interface using [ctrl][alt][F1] (works with [F1]-[F12] I think). One of these will also switch back to your GUI for when you need one; I think it's [ctrl][alt][F8] on Mint, so you might want to try that one. I'll throw myself in the \"use a tiling window manager\" camp though; i3 really is a great tool.\n", "Q: Can't get mysql/phpmyadmin to work after updating to 16.04 After the update, mysql/phpmyadmin stopped working.

For example,\nstty -F /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nHere -F tells stty to read options for a serial usb device, be it microcontroller or Raspberry \nFlags are not standalone, they depend on each comman.

Attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a likely solution. Any package(s) that are specified must completely correct the problem. This option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention. Use of this option together with -m may produce an error in some situations.\n\nHowever, in the case of the remove command (rm):\nrm -f, --force  Ignore nonexistant files, and never prompt before removing.\n\nSo, -f means different things to different commands.\n\nA: -f usually mean force a command,\nfor example to force the remove of a folder with content\nensted of\nrm -r myfolder/\nwe can force it by using\nrm -rf myfolder/\n", "Q: Sharing folder between Owncloud and Plex I have a working owncloud and plex installation.

They are called:\n\n\n*\n\n*eno1\n\n*enp3s0f3 \nIt's possible that these are actually the same adapter.  (e.g. I have servers here that emulate and appear as multiple network cards on the same physical interface.)\nSee here for how adapters are named in current kernels.\nThe outputs of both ip link and ip a show that the state is \"DOWN\".  This usually means that the cable is not physically connected.  So I would test your cables and the devices it's connecting to first.  Maybe plug the same cable into another laptop that you know works.\nIf/when you have discounted it being a cable/hardware fault, you might consider attempting to force the link up (overriding the trigger) like this:\nip link set eno1 up\n\nThen, you can manually assign it an ip address like this:\nip addr add 192.168.0.5/24\n\n(short form: ip a a 192.168.0.5/24)\n(Obviously replacing the ip address and range with one relevant to your network.)\nThen you can check to make sure it set correctly by calling ip a again and make sure that the state is \"UP\" and the IP is correct.\nThen attempt to ping a device on the network. (Making sure that the device you're pinging has ICMP Echo Reply on - many have it switched off by default these days!)\nIf it works, then the module for your ethernet card doesn't yet know how to do line detection yet.  This is highly unusual, and I'd probably consider patching your kernel or getting a newer kernel ASAP if it does.\nYou may also be a victim of module blacklisting.  If the wrong module is being loaded for your network device (because the right one is blacklisted) you may have to edit /etc/modules.conf or the files in /etc/modules.conf.d/ to ensure that the right module loads and/or the wrong one is prevented from loading.\nFinally, there may be a bug in the module for your card or a setting in your BIOS (particularly on newer rackmount servers) that control how the network card operates.\nI've listed these in the order of decreasing likelihood.  YMMV.\n", "Q: Protect root-owned script against tampering and run unattended w/ sudoers' NOPASSWD Using /etc/sudoers I gave a non-root user (anyuser below) permission to sudo-execute a root-owned script (test-script below) with the NOPASSWD: tag set.\nThe script's permission octal value is 0550. Its execution is possible only with one predefined argument (cache_bak below) and when the script file was not tampered with. The latter is possible based on a SHA256 digest-conditioned execution (relevant info in sudoers man page).\nThings work well , ... until I test-modify the script to get a different SHA digest and see how sudoers handles it.\nWhat I did was:\n$ cat /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script\n#!/bin/bash\n/bin/mkdir -p /var/\"$1\"\n/bin/cp -R /var/cache/* /var/\"$1\" # copies content of /var/cache/ \n                                  # to /var/$1, defined by script's lone arg \nexit $?\n# End of test-script\n\n$ sudo chmod 0550 /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script\n$ sudo chown root:admin /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script\n$ ls -lsAF test-*   # check\n4 -r-xr-x--- 1 root admin   75 Apr 25 18:23 test-script*\n\n$ cat /etc/group | grep sudo   # check\nsudo:x:27:anyuser\n\n$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers         # check\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults    mail_badpass\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\nDefaults    insults\nroot    ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL\n%sudo   ALL = (root:ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL\n%wheel Somehost = (ALL:ALL) ALL\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nI then populated /etc/sudoers.d with 10_user, whose content is:\n$ cat /etc/sudoers.d/10_user\nCmnd_Alias CPVARCACHE = sha256:48805bae82834f323xxxxxxxxxxxxx10145c7bbf80bae183b7de3ea52ef90637 /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script cache_bak\n\n# GROUP SPECS\n%admin Somehost = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rsync\n\n# USER SPECS\nanyuser Somehost = (root) NOPASSWD: CPVARCACHE\n\nEverything works well, i.e. no passwd is requested and the copy-job gets done, until I simulate having tampered with test-script. I did so by adding a line to it, e.g. if [ \"$1\" ] ;then :; fi and running: sudo /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script cache_bak again.\nThe sudo shell does not abort as I expected. Instead it checks that the SHA digest has become different and requests a password for anyuser to carry out the job. However, in that case, I want the line cmd to abort unattended (quietly). \nAttempting to redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null:\n# after modifying the script so its SHA digest is different from\n#+ that in '/etc/sudoers.d/10_user'\n\n$ sudo /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script cache_bak > /dev/null 2>&1\n[sudo] password for anyuser: _^C\n\nThe above only redirects output of the subshell process, not that of the sudo process. \nIf the script is tampered with I need the sudo process to abort, presumably even before it launches the script... I saw interesting stuff (e.g. this), but nothing really relevant... \n\nA: My solution directly adapted from MarcoS' answer on StackOverflow is:\n$ sudo -n /home/anyuser/Scripts/test-script cache_bak -- 2> sudo-stderr_\"$(date+\\%Y\\%m\\&d-\\%H\\%M\\%S)\".log\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe -n flag suppresses' sudo's passwd request. So nothing is displayed on stdout. \nIf a passwd is nevertheless required, sudo dies gracefully after sending an error message to stdderr. For example:\n$ sudo -n ls\nsudo: a password is required\n\nis immediately followed by sudo process death.\nTo redirect sudo's stderr, first add -- after the sudo'd cmd to signify that sudo stops interpreting what comes afterwards as cmd line arguments. Redirection of stderr is as usual denoted by 2> followed by ad-hoc log-filename.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu changes sound device after suspend, how to fix? So my setup currently is using a monitor plugged into my laptop via HDMI and using the speakers in that for audio not the inbuilt laptop ones. When the machine boots it uses HDMI by default, but I will often suspend the laptop throughout the day and whenever it resumes it switches the sound device to the inbuilt speakers.\nIt's not a big problem as you can imagine but is annoying, I wonder if there's a script I could use to force it to reselect HDMI after resume or disable the inbuilt speakers, or set as default some how. FYI both the inbuilt speakers are on the same 'sound card' but are two different devices. I use Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: If you don't want to reboot, simply restart pulseaudio:\npulseaudio --kill; pulseaudio --start\n\n\nA: I fixed this issue by setting fixed pulse profile to output:hdmi-stereo on resume.\nTo get a list of pulse profiles: pacmd list-cards.\nTo change pulse profile e.g.: pacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo. \nAbout running script after suspend: Run Script on Wakeup?\nAbout running pacmd as root: [Solved] Control pulseaudio with shell script via pacmd / Newbie Corner / Arch Linux Forums: \n\nA: Fixing PulseAudio switching off HDMI sound on Suspend\nThis \"undocumented feature\" appeared with Ubuntu 16.04 and new version of PulseAudio 8.\nCreate a new file /lib/systemd/system-sleep/tv-sound and copy in:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    echo \"Going to $2...\"\n    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0`\n    # if no pre suspend action required\n    sleep 1\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    echo \"Waking up from $2...\"\n    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` \n    # if no post suspend action required\n    sleep 2\n    export PULSE_RUNTIME_PATH=\"/run/user/1000/pulse/\"\n    sudo -u rick -E pacmd set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo\n    ;;\nesac\n\nNOTE: replace user name rick (third line from the bottom) with your user name.\nThen mark it executable with the command:\nsudo chmod +x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/tv-sound\n\nAn additional step might be required if output:hdmi-stereo (the device for most people) is different on your system.\n\nA: Run:\n$ pacmd list-cards\n\nTo display the index of your cards. For example, my pci sound card is at index 2. The sound profile for analogue output (again as an example) is called output:analog-stereo.\nThen:\n$ pacmd set-card-profile 2 output:analog-stereo\n\nTo set this as the output (give it a try). To make it permanent, edit /etc/pulse/default.pa and add:\nset-card-profile 2  output:analog-stereo\nset-default-sink 2\n\nRestart pulseaudio or reboot to check persistence.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 17.10. After suspend, or even after dimming the Display, it would always change my audio output from Digital Output (desired) to HDMI even though my Display does not have any speakers. Commenting out the line\nload-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nin /etc/pulse/default.pa did the trick as described in Disable sound through HDMI permanently.\nNote that setting default sinks as pointed out above did not change the behavior. Also, the script provided above to set the audio card profile after suspend is user-specific. \n\nA: This issue may be related to a problem with Pulseaudio, version 8, as outlined in this (long) bug thread on freedesktop.org.\nBasically, Pulseaudio reroutes the sound when it loses contact with HDMI and doesn't return it after HDMI is reconnected. It is fixed in version 9.\nIn order to return version 8 to the behavior of previous versions, follow these directions and reboot.\n\nedit /etc/pulse/default.pa to comment out (add # to the start of) the line:\n#load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\n\nThen set the sound output in Sound Settings and check that it persists by suspend/resume or blanking the screen. It did work for me.\n\nA: I have had this problem since Ubuntu 9.04. It never has worked and now that the children who just got HDMI or just got Ubuntu think the problem is something new so people trying to look at the latest changes in the setup are being misled. So let me make this clear: This problem has always been around and nobody is working on it. I've spent at least 20 hours researching this issue. So what I have done in the past:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*While turning on the TV (HDMI target) if I wiggle the mouse at just the right time it restores the sound maybe 50% of the time. This is a timing related/handshaking issue.\n\n*In Ubuntu 14 I would change the screen resolution to something different then back again. This doesn't seem to work with Ubuntu 16\n\n*Don't let it hibernate. An alternative is just do a timed shutdown. Later you just boot your computer rather than re-boot. \nRemember this is a TIMING issue, so I presume any of the ideas here can work if the timing happens to jog your system correctly.\n\n\nA: Same happens for me but only if the HDMI monitor is not \"awake\" when OS starts or resumes: the list of devices in Settings > Sound doesn't even show HMDI/DisplayPort - Built-in Audio any more. \nThe fix for me is to suspend the session, ensure HDMI monitor is on, resume the session. \nSuspend in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is somewhat insanely hidden behind the PowerOff button in the drop down menu: hold mouse down on it, or press Alt to convert the PowerOff button into Suspend.

So you get an executable file (here a.out).\nyou should give that file execution permissions with the following command:\nchmod +x a.out\n\nand then run your compiled program with \n./a.out\n\n\nA: You can also customize the output file by using gcc <sourcefilename> -o <destinationfilename>\nNote: you can even dump the output file in a different folder by including the path in the file name.  Ex\ngcc mysource.c -o ./myfolder/mybinary.out\n\nThis will create a file named mybinary.out in the folder, myfolder, within your current working directory.  ./ is short had for the current working directory.\n", "Q: sublime-text color picker tool does not work in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS I just installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS version, then installed sublime-text 3 (build 3103) and ColorPicker tool.\nI can access the ColorPicker tool using Ctrl+Shift+C and select a color, but the selected color does not appear on the window. ie. after I select a particular color and click ok nothing happens except closing the window.

I would like a more convenient way to run commands instead of copypasting them with the mouse. yanking would be more convenient, so is it possible to configure the shell to paste the clipboard if I press ctrl+y, just like emacs does?\n\nA: emacs uses buffer for everything and the things like kill (C-w) - yank (C-y) or copy (M-w) - yank (C-y) are emacs controlled properties (other editors (e.g. vi) support these sort of behaviors too).\nBut the terminal behaves differently; it runs a shell inside and it does not contain the mentioned concepts.

This is the equivalent of searching for \"additional drivers\":\nsudo ubuntu-drivers list\n\nthen use:\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\nFor me, this updated the driver for my nvidia quadroFx 3800 in a way that using sudo apt-get install nvidia-current would not.\nAfter autoinstall, invoke another tty (ex. ctrl+alt+f1) and \nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: In case you really want to use the drivers provided by Nvidia from their website (they solved cublas error CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED on my NVIDIA GTX980M), the only thing that worked for me was:\nPress CTRL-ALT-F1\nUninstall any previous drivers:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nUninstall the drivers from the .run file:\nsudo nvidia-uninstall\n\nThis should remove the login loop, so now reboot and login normally.\nApply only if you use lightdm,\nPress again CTRL-ALT-F1 and do:\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo bash Your-Nvidia-Drivers-File.run\n\nI used all the default options, except for the opengl, where I said no. I don't know if this is important though.\nAnd here is the important part: DO NOT reboot. Just do:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nand press CTRL-ALT-F7 to login immediately after installation. This way I never saw a login loop again.\n\nA: I used to have this problem and I googled it all day all night and finally found the right site for solution. It looks like the problem lies in your laptop using NVIDIA Optimus. I solve this using \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-364 nvidia-prime\n\nFollow this installation guide here for more info http://rajat-osgyan.blogspot.co.id/2016/04/how-to-install-latest-nvidia-drivers-on.html\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu 14.04 and NVIDIA-304 driver.\nThis driver was updated from version 304.131 to 304.132 during one of the system updates. This new driver version was the source of my problem.\nReinstalling the old driver version (304.131) solved this. Everything works fine now. \nFor more Info see this Launchpad bug page\nHere you can find driver 304.1:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-304/304.131-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nOn the right hand side of the page choose your build (amd 64 or i386), this will open the downloads page, where you can choose your download (mine was nvidia-304_304.131-0ubuntu0.14.04.1_i386.deb ).\nDownload and copy to a USB stick.\nPower on the computer with the login Loop problem, open terminal, stop lightdm:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nPurge NVIDIA drivers:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\nPlug in the USB stick with the downoaded file, run fdisk to identify your USB stick on the computer:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n(mine was /dev/sdb1)\nMount the usb stick, but first create a mount point:  \nsudo mkdir /media/usb\n\nMount the usb stick:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\nCheck if the downloaded file is present:\nls /media/usb\n\nInstall the NVIDIA driver:\nsudo dpkg -i /media/usb/nvidia-304_304.131-0ubuntu0.14.04.2_i386.deb\n\n(please replace the file name with the one of your download)\nUnmount USB stick:\nsudo umount /media/usb\n\nReboot system\nsudo reboot\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I had a similar issue after messing around with my screen configs in xorg.conf via the Nvidia-control panel.  I had previously been running the currently latest drivers (at the time 381.09) on my 1080 with 3 screens with no problem. But once I restarted I got the login loop.\nTo fix I simply: \n\n\n*\n\n*opened a terminal ctrl-alt-f1\n\n*moved my renamed my xorg.conf file sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf~\n\n*Then restarted allowing the system to workout it's own config again.\n\n\nThis was a very quick fix - no need to reinstall drivers etc. Which I was keen to do to avoid messing up various dependents e.g. CUDA\n\nA: I have had similar problems on several computers since upgrading to 16.04. First of all make sure secure boot is disabled in computer BIOS. Older computers won't even have this option.\nCan you get to a command prompt by hitting Ctrl-Alt-F4? If so type your username and then your password to login. From there try typing:\nsudo lspci|grep VGA\n\nand enter password when asked.\nIf your system says you have NVIDIA graphics then type:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia\n\nWait until this finishes and then type:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nOnce complete type sudo shutdown -r now to restart the computer. You should be booting into a functional desktop.\nThis can also fix a login loop issue on 16.04 or a black screen with cursor problem.\n\nA: Called the customer service and finally the problem solved. I have 2 GPUs (Geforce 1080 and 1080Ti) on my SuperMicro workstation. After install the GPU driver in a proper way that needs to go into the tty mode and stop the lightdm, you need to plug out the VGA/DVI on the motherboard and plug the monitor cable to the GPU ports. In my case, plug to the DVI of GPU 1080Ti, the login loop problem solved. \n\nA: One other solution I must add here is to just not use NVIDIA drivers because they are creating such a mess, so often, and user are not always aware that NVIDIA drivers are the underlying reason.\nI would rather recommend to use the Nouveau drivers. I never experienced any issues after installing Nouveau drivers.\n1 - Purge NVIDIA packages:\nsudo apt purge nvidia*\n\n2 - Install a Nouveau driver. For Ubuntu 16.04 I suggest to use xserver-xorg-video-nouveau-lts-xenial:\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau-lts-xenial\n\n3- Then reboot\nsudo reboot\n\nNow the problem should be fixed!\nFor some Graphic device there might still be another problem: being stuck with an ugly low resolution of 800 x 600.\nHere are some extra steps to overcome this and to set the resolution you want:\n4- Go to your grub configuration file (here I will use nano):\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n5- In the file look for a line starting with #GRUB_GFXMODE= (maybe you will see written #GRUB_GFXMODE=800x600)\n6- Uncomment the line (remove the #) and replace the current resolution by the one of your choice. Here I use 1920x1200 to obtain this:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1200\n\n7- Save changes and close the file.\n8- Update your grub parameters:\nsudo update-grub\n\n9- Reboot one last time:\nsudo reboot\n\nNow everything should work well: you are able to log in, and the resolution displayed is the one you chosed.\nAn error message complaining about xrandr can appear after log in: This is not yet a complete fix, but shouldn't be too much of a problem either. Just \"ok\" it.\nChosing Nouveau drivers should spare you a lot of burden, since you will not experience NVIDIA driver updates that could mess your installation.\n\nA: I ran into the login loop problem running Ubuntu 16.04 on a Macbook Pro Retina bought in 2012.\nOver the years I have always been using the nvidia-304 driver from xorg-edgers that was going fine and mostly the only working option (with uefi boot). With the latest update (Nov 4 2016 on ubuntu 16.04) this driver stopped working and I spent long time trying to figure out the problems (I had nomodeset in boot options throughout).\nMy solution finally was to either \n1) use nouveau (surprisingly because this never worked before) putting nouveau in /etc/modules and using a xorg.conf putting nouveau as device (but performance of this driver is suboptimal even on ordinary desktop activities) or \n2) actually the latest nvidia driver nvidia-367 with no xorg.conf\n\nA: Nuance: in my case I have a rather old gfx card - GTX280\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*checked at nvidia.com which driver version supports my card, in my\ncase it was nvidia-340\n\n*service lightdm stop\n\n*apt-get purge lightdm\n\n*apt-get purge nvidia*\n\n*apt-get install nvidia-340\n\n*apt-get install lightdm\n\n*restarted the system\nI've noted that nvidia-367 installs gdm, so after nvidia drivers installation you will have both lightdm and gdm alongside, possibley it can be the key to the problem.\n", "Q: \"Booting in insecure mode\" when secure boot is turned on I have a dual boot (UEFI) Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu 16.04. During Ubuntu install IT asked me to turn off secure boot, so I did it, using the installer. When I finished installation, I turned secure boot on again in BIOS, but I keep getting this:\nBooting in insecure mode_\n\nEvery time I start my PC, before entering GRUB. I checked it on Windows and it says that secure boot is enabled, same as my BIOS. I am attaching a photo of my BIOS config:\n\nHow can I turn secure boot back on so Ubuntu will see it as enabled? Is there any way to get rid of this annoying message? Thanks in advance ;-)\n\nA: I know that Dell ships their Linux systems with a variable set that disables validation:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544794\nThe solution is to enable validation in that case.  Perhaps this is what you're seeing?  Try running:\nmokutil --enable-validation\n\n\nA: That message is normally displayed by Shim when the system is configured with Secure Boot disabled. I seem to recall it being displayed in error on at least one system, but I don't recall the details. If this is what's happening, you won't get rid of the message, so you should simply learn to live with it -- at least, unless and until an updated Shim binary is released that fixes the problem.\nYou may want to check your Secure Boot mode in Ubuntu, though. You can do so as follows:\n$ hexdump /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SecureBoot-8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c\n0000000 0016 0000 0001                         \n0000005\n\nThe first line of output shows the value of the EFI's SecureBoot variable. In this case, it ends in 0001, which indicates Secure Boot is active. If it reads 0000 instead, that means it's inactive. If you get a No such file or directory error, that means that the system doesn't support Secure Boot at all (or maybe that it's supported but has never been active), which is effectively the same as it being inactive.\nIf the firmware's own UI says that Secure Boot is active but it's inactive in Ubuntu, then that suggests a problem somewhere. I know some recent versions of Shim have a way of effectively bypassing Secure Boot if they're configured in a certain way, so that might be what's going on; but I'd need to dig a little deeper to figure out what that feature is or how to check or reconfigure it.\n\nA: You can check the status of Secure Boot by -\n$ mokutil --sb-state\n\nFor you, the output might be -\nSecureBoot enabled\nSecureBoot validation is disabled in shim\n\nYou need to use the following command to re-enable Secure Boot validation, which will eventually not show the text \"booting in insecure mode\".\n$ sudo mokutil --enable-validation\n\nHere, the command will ask you to enter a password.\nThis password is not your login password but just a temporary password. You need to set a password which will be asked in the following steps.\nNow, restart and follow the instruction shown on Perform MOK management blue screen. \nSelect Change Secure Boot state.\nSources - \nhttps://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot\n", "Q: When will 16.04 AMIs be available on the AWS MarketPlace?

I was using ap-hotspot for wifi hotspot through terminal. It seems ap-hotspot is no more; is there any alternative to create a wifi hotspot? If there is, how can it be installed/used?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, there’s a Hotspot mode in the WiFi connection editings page that works directly for Android devices. Here’s the step by step:\n\n\n*\n\n*First disable WiFi and connect your laptop/PC to a wired network. \n\n*Click Edit Connections on the network menu. Then click Add on the network connections to add a new connection:\n\n*Choose WiFi from the drop-down box in the next window and click Create button.\n\n*When the editing WiFi hotspot window pops up, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in connection name, SSID, select Hotspot mode.\n\n*In Wifi Security tab, select WPA & WPA2 Personal and type in a password.\n\n*In IPv4 Settings tab, select mode “Share to other computers”\n\n\n\n*After you clicked the save button, enable WiFi and click Connect to Hidden Wi-Fi network and select connect to the connection you just created.\n\n\n*Your network menu should now have the WiFi hotspot connection:\nFinally connect to this hotspot from your Android device and enjoy!\nUpdate!\nAfter following the guide and before enabling WiFi, restart the Network Manager with:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nThen enable WiFi and it should connect.\n\nA: One line solution\nFirst, you can try the one line solution based on the command line interface of NetworkManager.\nnmcli device wifi hotspot con-name my-hotspot ssid my-hotspot band bg password jesuisunmotdepasse\n\nif it does not work, you should try the 3 line solution here :\nThree lines solution\nHere is a solution based on the great command line tool of NetworkManager. It is very straight forward, works with WPA and Access Point Mode (so it works on smartphones), and do not need complex set up. Once it's set up, you can just use the graphical interface to toogle the access point. Just run the following lines to create and enable the access point :\n# Create a connection\nnmcli connection add type wifi ifname '*' con-name my-hotspot autoconnect no ssid my-local-hotspot\n# Put it in Access Point\nnmcli connection modify my-hotspot 802-11-wireless.mode ap 802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared\n# Set a WPA password (you should change it)\nnmcli connection modify my-hotspot 802-11-wireless-security.key-mgmt wpa-psk 802-11-wireless-security.psk myhardpassword\n# Enable it (run this command each time you want to enable the access point)\nnmcli connection up my-hotspot\n\nNow connect on your Smartphone... When you do not need it anymore, disable it with :\nnmcli connection down my-hotspot\n\nTo enable it again, you will just need to use the last command of the 4 lines command. You can note that since the connection also appears in the available connections, you can enable/disable it from graphical interface.\n\nA: I use create_ap\nCheck the GitHub page for details:\nThis script creates a NATed or Bridged WiFi Access Point.\nI usually use this two options :\n\n\n*\n\n*For Bridged Internet sharing : share your Ethernet or modem internet via WiFi\ncreate_ap -m bridge wlan0 eth0 MyAccessPoint MyPassPhrase\n\nwhere wlan0 is your WiFi interface, and eth0 is the interface that offer internet ( Ethernet or modem).\n\n*Internet sharing from the same WiFi interface : this will allow you to share the internet from the same WiFi interface, useful if you want to re share the WiFi that you're already connected to it to extend WiFi area for example :\ncreate_ap wlan0 wlan0 MyAccessPoint MyPassPhrase\n\n\nA: I also had this issue for a while, to solve this issue I did the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install packages:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-pptp-gnome \nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq-base\n\n*Creating a wifi-hotspot\nEdit Connection -> Select + and add wifi connection, and give mode as Hostport \nIf you need you may provide password\n\n*Restart the network manager\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n*Start the Hostport \nnmcli connection up <name of your hostport>\n", "Q: Unable to install unity-webapps in ubuntu 16.04 I'm unable to install unity-webapps after upgrading to 16.04.

There is a scroll bar, but it won't scroll far enough.\nI though I had found the file where this is stored in, ~/.config/startupconfig, which has the line:\nkdeglobals_kscreen_scalefactor=3\n\nHowever, when I change the 3 to a 1, it turns back to a 3 next time I restart KDE and the problem persists.\nI tried running systemsettings5 using ssh to display it on another computer, but it crashes as soon as I go into the Display and Monitor part.\nAny idea of where this is stored or how I could reset it without losing all my other KDE settings? \n\nA: In case anyone else runs into this, this is what I did (though I imagine there must be a better way): I got a spare monitor and connected it to the computer (after turning it off), along with the original monitor.  (Fortunately my video card had multiple plugs.)  On rebooting, I used nvidia-settings to move the new monitor's position to below the other one.  That gave enough room for all (or at least enough) of the System Settings window to be visible, so I could get to the Scale Display bit and reset it back to 1.  Then I shutdown the computer and removed the extra monitor.  On restart, the GUI was back to normal size and I could see all of the System Settings window.\n\nA: To reset scaling settings in KDE5 I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed [KScreen] section (it contained two options - ScaleFactor and ScreenScaleFactors) from ~/.config/kdeglobals.\n\n*Commented kdeglobals_kscreen_screenscalefactors= in ~/.config/startupconfig.\n\n\nThis worked.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nStart a terminal window CTRL ALT T\nIn the terminal, type dconf reset -f /\nThen type exit to close the terminal window.\nThat will get you back to your tiny fonts.\n", "Q: How to get back Launcher icon for emacs in 16.04?

After updating to Ubuntu 16.04. the boot time is a bit longer (more than 10-15 seconds). I looked at the \"dmesg\" output and found this:\n[   23.882674] audit: type=1400 audit(1461650474.108:10): apparmor=\"STATUS\" operation=\"profile_load\" profile=\"unconfined\" name=\"/usr/bin/evince\" pid=644 comm=\"apparmor_parser\"\n**[   23.882682]** audit: type=1400 audit(1461650474.108:11): apparmor=\"STATUS\" operation=\"profile_load\" profile=\"unconfined\" name=\"/usr/bin/evince//sanitized_helper\" pid=644 comm=\"apparmor_parser\"\n**[   32.162714]** cgroup: new mount options do not match the existing superblock, will be ignored\n[   32.777477] Bluetooth: BNEP (Ethernet Emulation) ver 1.3\n[   32.777480] Bluetooth: BNEP filters: protocol multicast\n\nI assumed that the number on the left side of the \"dmesg\"output is time. If I lose 9 seconds on this step, what can I do to improve boot time?\n\nA: Systemd is responsible for booting process. You can improve it by disabling some services or trying to fix your configuration. To check how much time services take in your boot process you can run:\nsystemd-analyze blame\n\nFor graphical detailed view of your boot procedure you can generate a plot image:\nsystemd-analyze plot > bootimage\n\nNow you can open bootimage with eg. eog or different image viewer and check how much time services are taking (and eg. where system stops when booting). It will look like this:    \n \nAs we can see e.g virtualbox.service is taking 62ms which is very nice but mounting my F3 disk is not so fast. I can consider to disable automounting (it's kinda bad example because systemd is lanuching services in parallel mode and this service is not slowing boot time, nothing depends on it but this is how it works). (In your dmesg output there is something wrong with mount options. You can check in /etc/fstab)\nIf you want do disable any service it is good to know if something else is not using this service as dependency. You can check it on e.g virtualbox.service example :\nsystemctl list-dependencies virtualbox.service --reverse \n\nThe output shows there aren't any service files related. So if I don't need it I can stop and disable it without any complications:\nsudo systemctl disable virtualbox.service --now\n\n\nIf you find some services in your system which are taking long time to load first read about what it is exactly doing and then try to fix related configuration files or if you don't need it disable it. \n", "Q: Filesystem/RAID configuration to stripe/mirror three hard drives I have 3 HDDs in my workstation:\n\n\n*\n\n*1.5 TB (drive \"A\")\n\n*2TB (drive \"B\")\n\n*4TB (drive \"C\")\n\n\nI am doing a fresh install of 16.04.

The 500GB could be ext4 etc. but ZFS and btrfs both have nice features that, from what I've read, would benefit a data storage partition.  I'm inclined to find a solution using ZFS due to the support now in 16.04, but open to any solutions that meet my requirements.\nI've read about RAID10 and RAID01 but those look like they need 4 HDD.  But perhaps there is a RAID configuration that does what I want, using some combination of ext4/LVM/ZFS/btrfs.\nI would greatly appreciate any advice on what is (a) possible and (b) recommended for this scenario!\n\nA: Can accomplish what you want, drive A and drive B as appearing as 1 drive with btrfs.\nCommand to use full capacity of multiple drives with different sizes (metadata mirrored, data not mirrored and not striped):\nmkfs.btrfs -d single /dev/sda /dev/sdb\nThere will be no redundancy with this setup, so if 1 drive goes out all the data will be lost.\nCheck out the btrfs wiki page on multi-drive setups.\nhttps://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Using_Btrfs_with_Multiple_Devices\n\nA: The hard plans you have can not exactly be achieved with btrfs, simply because you can not configure it that way. Btrfs can be told to use a specific raid level but it will decide by itself on which drive it will put the data and where to put the mirrorored data. \nWith an MD array you can do that. First create a striped array with drive A and B and then create a mirrored array with the stripe + DriveC-data-partition. But that would be too complicated for me. Configuring/Re-configuring this will be a real pain matching exact sizes of the partitions and so on...\nHowever if you add all 3 data partitions into one btrfs file system you should end up with more or less what you intend. \nmkfs.btrfs -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdcx\nZFS: I do not know...\n", "Q: Missing desktop icons with Nemo on Ubuntu 16.04 I recently upgraded Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04.

When I restarted my computer it gave me an Boot Violation message. It seemed like it was going to bring me into BIOS but booted straight to Ubuntu somehow. I'm not quite sure what I did wrong or how to fix it. I have the USB that I used to install linux if that helps. I have tried using Boot Repair but receive this message when I run it:\n\nGPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.\n  Alternatively, you can retry after activating the [Separate /boot/efi partition:] option.\n\nI have found several posts similar to this one on the site but they either do not have a response or are for laptops that are trying to (re)install an OS and it did not work.\n\nA: There are several different answers to the question to which you linked, so it's quite unclear what procedure you followed; however, it sounds like you may have created a new GRUB binary that was not signed with a valid Secure Boot key; or perhaps you installed a BIOS-mode version of GRUB and the attempt to launch it triggered your firmware's Secure Boot warning. In either case, by my hypothesis you then dropped back to your standard Ubuntu version of GRUB, which launched Ubuntu.\nSecure Boot is a complex topic. In brief, with Secure Boot active, EFI boot loaders must be signed with keys that you as a user do not normally control. (There are ways to take control of the process yourself, but that's a very advanced topic.) Thus, if you modify the boot loader binary (typically grubx64.efi), you must either disable Secure Boot or learn enough about it to sign the binary and add your key to the Machine Owner Key (MOK) database. For more on this, see my Web page on the topic.\nConcerning your \"GPT detected...\" message from Boot Repair, that indicates that you booted your Boot Repair disk in BIOS mode, whereas your regular Ubuntu installation is probably in EFI mode. With an EFI-mode installation on the hard disk, it's almost always best to disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy-mode support\" or a similar term) in the firmware setup utility. This action will prevent accidental boots in BIOS mode. See my page on the CSM for more on how the CSM can cause problems and how to avoid these problems.\nNote that Secure Boot and CSM are both optional EFI features; an EFI can support, neither, one, or both of these features. The easiest EFI-mode boot path disables both of them; however, there are cases in which one or the other of those features is desirable. It's rare for both of them to be necessary, and in fact some EFIs make them mutually exclusive -- you can't activate the CSM if Secure Boot is active.\nMore broadly speaking, there should be no reason to involve GRUB in creating a Windows bootable USB drive; Windows has its own boot loaders (both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode), so GRUB is an extra complication at best. That said, I couldn't tell you how to create a bootable Windows disk from either Windows or Ubuntu, so I can't offer an alternative or commentary on whatever procedure you've followed, except to say that I'm skeptical of any procedure that involves GRUB.\n", "Q: Create directories from textfile I have a text file named checklog.txt.

Full disclosure: I have been using Ubuntu for a few months only so I am not very versed in it.\nifconfig -a gives the following output:\nenp2s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 8c:89:a5:xx:xx:xx \n          inet6 addr: fe80::ea6:251d:95dd:dea0/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:152 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:26388 (26.3 KB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:1172 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:1172 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1 \n          RX bytes:86432 (86.4 KB)  TX bytes:86432 (86.4 KB)\n\nand ip link gives me this:\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1\n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n2: enp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 8c:89:a5:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`\n\nI tried to solve the issue by doing the following:\nfirst, I renamed the ethernet connection to eth0 by creating\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-network.rules\n\nand adding the line\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTR{address}==\"8c:89:a5:xx:xx:xx\",KERNEL== \"enp2s0\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nthen, I edited network interfaces\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nby adding\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThese measures did not help.\nNeither did\nsudo ethtool -s NAME speed 100 duplex full autoneg off\n\nwith NAME = enp2s0 before and eth0 after renaming.\nSince nothing worked I reverted everything back to the original state and hope that some of you might have a better idea.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To resolve this I've just changed the reference from eth0 to enp2s0 (or what ever your interface is named) in /etc/network/interfaces.  There may be a better way but it worked.  \n", "Q: How do I check if a set of commands are executed on startup? I'm in the process of creating a GUI-frontend to xrandr, and I need some commands to be executed on startup.\nI'm using a .desktop file placed in ~/.config/autostart.\nI can't tell if this will work, since xrandr doesn't work with my setup - I know things are working as they are meant to be; it's just my system doesn't support it - I'll just a get a bunch of xrandr errors. Which also means that I'll get errors on startup and no noticable change.\nIs there some way of finding out whether the commands have been executed?\n\nA: If your auto started .desktop file is a script you simply can put a control echo into the script like following example:\n# if yyou want only data saved for one run\n\necho \"Script has run on $(date)\" > ~/script.log\n\n# if you want a continous log output append\n\nif [ -e ~/script-log ]\n    then\n        echo \"Script has run on $(date)\" >> ~/script.log\nelse\n        touch ~/script.log\n        echo \"Script has run on $(date)\" >> ~/script.log\nfi\n\nThis way you even can output some variable data you might want for controling this way. Just make sure your final result is printed after all commands in the script so you know the script has run through.\nIf you want to exactly know if your commands in your script have failed you as well can do:\n# do this at start of your script\n\nif [ -e ~/script-error.log ]\n    then\n        # we do nothing\nelse\n        touch ~/script-error.log\nfi\n\n# then within your script (I use as example here cd /root just to demonstrate)\n# you can do this with nearly all commands\n\ncd /root 2>> ~/script-error.log\n\nThis would fetch only if one of your commands would throw an error. Sure not applicable everywhere but sill better as having no output at all.\nExplanation of the piping:\n# single piping symbol (overwrite the existing file and creates one if not existant)\n>               # pipes all output \n1>              # pipes only success messages\n2>              # pipes only error messages\n\n# double piping symbol (append to an existing file and fail if file does not exist)\n>>              # pipes all output\n1>>             # pipes only success messages\n2>>             # pipes only error messages\n\nWant to know more about bash scripting in depth here two links:\nBash Guide for Beginners - Machtelt Garrels - 2008\nAdvanced Bash-Scripting Guide - Mendel Cooper - 2014\n", "Q: What is the process gvfsd-smb-browse? That process happened to crash on my system.\nNothing very serious, but as I am curious I tried to get information on it but could not find a quite satisfying answer about what it is and what it does.\nAll I know is that it is somewhat related to Samba, but nothing more precise.\nAnybody has a more precise explanation of what it is ?\n\nA: I've found something in the GVFS man page that states that it's for browsing windows file shares. \n• gvfsd-smb-browse - browses Windows Shares Filesystem volumes\nGVFS is the gnome virtual filesystem:\nGIO provides a VFS API to GLib applications. It includes a 'local'\nimplementation using POSIX. gvfs provides implementations that go\nbeyond that and allow to access files and storage using many protocols,\nsuch as ftp, http, sftp, dav, obexftp, etc. It also provides support\nfor trash folders, for cd burning and for monitoring interesting\ndevices and volumes on the computer.\n\nThere are several reports of bugs in GVFS which caused 100% cpu usage including this one which is currently open.\n\nA: I switched from Kubuntu 16.04 LTS to a Xubuntu 16.04 desktop expecting a leaner desktop.  However, it pulled in some of the GNOME annoyance including this gvfsd-smb-browse.\nFortunately, the package that provides the plugin, can be removed by opening a terminal and using the following.\n   $ dpkg -S /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-smb-browse\n   gvfs-backends: /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-smb-browse\n   $ dpkg -L gvfs-backends\n\nIf you don't care for the other functionalities, remove the package\n   $ sudo apt-get remove gvfs-backends\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 mysql-client-5.7 dependencies issue on update: Permanent solution?

That would maybe cause some problems if one day I want to keep only fedora, but until that time, it would allow me to boot on USBLive ?\nThank again !\n\nA: I'll begin by answering the questions at the end of your post:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI-mode booting uses the firmware's native boot mode, whereas BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting uses the Compatibility Support Module, which permits booting older BIOS-mode boot loaders. See this question and my answer to it on superuser.com for more on this subject.\n\n*GRUB is one of several EFI-mode boot loaders for Linux. (There are also versions of GRUB for BIOS and other firmware types.) GRUB Legacy, aka GRUB 1, was never officially supported for EFI, although Fedora did have a heavily-patched version that's now abandonware. Thus, most references to GRUB in an EFI context refer to GRUB 2.\n\n*Secure Boot is an optional EFI feature intended to improve system security by blocking an EFI from launching binaries that are not cryptographically signed by a trusted authority. In principle, this authority could be you; or it could be somebody else. In practice, Microsoft holds the only commonly-available keys for Secure Boot, and so controls the process. Fortunately, Microsoft will sign third-party binaries, and Ubuntu has used this to have Microsoft sign a binary called Shim that, in turn, includes Canonical's key, which is used to sign GRUB and the Linux kernel in Ubuntu. Note that, when dual-booting two Linux distributions, neither distribution's Shim will include the key for the other distribution. Thus, you must register the other distribution's key with the Machine Owner Key (MOK) list, which you can do with the MokManager.efi utility under EFI. I think the sb-updatevar utility can do this in Linux, too, but I have less experience with it. See here for several keys in one handy place; you'd need .cer or .der keys. See my page on Secure Boot for more on this subject.\n\n\nAs to your main problem, the efibootmgr -o (or efibootmgr --bootorder) command should give control to whatever boot program you specify. Note, however, that you probably meant to give to control to Boot0001 or Boot0007, not Boot0006 -- Ubuntu uses the name ubuntu, not grub, to describe its own boot entries. You can better identify each of these by typing sudo efibootmgr -v, which produces complete paths to the boot entries (identified using EFI path identifiers, which are long and complex and refer, among other things, to partitions' GUID numbers, which you can get with gdisk or some versions of blkid). Thus, before you do anything else, you might want to try changing the boot order to the correct value, rather than to Boot0004.\nIn practice, efibootmgr changes sometimes fails to work because of buggy EFIs or corrupted data in the machine's NVRAM (which is where the data that efibootmgr displays and adjusts is stored). Three solutions to such problems are commonly employed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe unwanted entries -- Sometimes deleting an unwanted or duplicate entry, as in sudo efibootmgr -b 0004 -B to delete Boot0004, will fix a problem. (You might or might not actually want to delete this entry, though.) Sometimes you may need to delete multiple boot entries to get the system working again. Do not delete entries you need to boot, though. Also, most computers have entries that the firmware itself creates, like the two Network Controller entries in your output. Deleting those entries is generally inadvisable.\n\n*Reset the firmware to its defaults -- Most EFIs provide an option to reset all settings to their defaults in the firmware setup utility. (What some people call the \"BIOS setup screens\" or something similar -- although EFIs are technically not BIOSes, despite the fact that many people, and even manufacturers, often refer to them as such.) The drawback to this approach is that it's likely to wipe out all the EFI entries, rendering the system unbootable until you use an emergency disk to restore at least one working entry.\n\n*Piggyback your boot loader on another entry -- This approach involves copying or moving/renaming your desired boot loader to use the filename of whatever the EFI insists on launching. It's generally used when an EFI refuses to launch anything but the Windows boot loader, so it shouldn't be necessary in your case.\n\n\nStepping back a bit further, though, I'll say that it really shouldn't matter which GRUB you use (Fedora's or Ubuntu's); they're basically the same software. If you're having problem configuring Fedora's GRUB to do what you want, you could always tweak its settings -- but OTOH, GRUB 2 configuration is notoriously difficult once you move beyond some very basic things. For this reason, many people who dual-boot multiple Linux distributions prefer to have a distribution-independent boot loader -- either their own GRUB or something else. My own rEFInd boot manager has several advantages for such configurations, such as a lack of reliance on configuration files to detect kernel updates and its independence from any given OS's configuration scripts. That said, if you're having trouble getting efibootmgr to switch from one GRUB to another, you might also have problems getting rEFInd (or any other boot loader) to launch. Also, if you're using Secure Boot, you may need to register at least one Secure Boot key with your MOK to get rEFInd to work. For that matter, if the reason you want to switch to Ubuntu's GRUB is that Fedora's GRUB won't launch Ubuntu's kernels, then the issue is most likely Secure Boot; adding the Secure Boot key for Canonical/Ubuntu should overcome that problem.\n\nEDIT:\nBoot0001 is the entry that's most likely to do what you want, so it should go at the start of your boot list; but it sounds like that's not working for you.\nIf you can live with leaving Fedora in charge of the boot process, it might be best to do so, lest you end up creating a cascade of new problems. Certainly outright deleting the Fedora entry is risky, since if you then can't get anything else to work, you may be left unable to boot anything.\nYou might try disabling Secure Boot, assuming it's currently enabled, since that feature can cause problems, particularly on complex setups.\n\nA: I've finally, thank to Rod Smith's help, found a solution to choose the boot order that I want.\nAs he mentionned to disable the Secure Boot, I've access the bios settings, and as expected, the Secure Boot was already disable, but I've taken the opportunity to be in the bios/uefi settings to change without efibootmgr the boot order.\nThen I have choosen to boot first on usb device, and then I've set an order for the boot on the hard disk, with ubuntu first, and it work !\nSo I clearly think that when efibootmgr is not able, for whatever reason, to change the order, going directly into the bios/uefi settings might be the best options, and not a really difficult one.\nI hope this could help others.\nThanks again for your help.\nXavier\n", "Q: Use pip with Python 3.5 I have a AWS Ubuntu instance where I manually installed Python3.5 (downloaded it, configured, and ran make, make install).

With a .deb, you'd need to upgrade A, and that might in turn impact some other packages; with snap, the application would come bundled with version B for its sole use, so the system-wide version A remains untouched.\n", "Q: No Wifi in Qualcom Atheros - Ubuntu 16.04 - Acer Aspire E 15 After Installing Ubuntu 16.04 in Acer laptop with Qualcom Atheros , it does not work.

When I turned it on and after selecting \"Ubuntu\" on the Grub screen, the notebooks screen starts to flicker and nothing happens.\nAfter a few trying I brought it back to my room, connected to my external monitor and the system booted up. I turned off the second screen in the Display menu, but it didn't help. I changed the nvidia driver back to version 340 from 36x, but it didn't help neither.\nSo at this moment I can only use my notebook with an external monitor.

I attempted to upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04 last night - it appeared to hit a point in installation where it started to hang then froze/failed overnight. I bought the laptop originally with Windows 7 and Ubuntu dual boot. Before upgrading I backed up my user's /home directory. Now on boot Ubuntu won't mount and just freezes immediately.\nHaving never done an install on my own (rather previously using vm's), can I install 16.04 from a jump drive and have it overwrite the failed 15.10 instance then just restore my backed up directory? Or will doing so install a fresh 16.04 instance with its own partition?\nI apologize in advance if there are many other 16.04 upgrade questions - thanks in advance.\n\nA: If your home directory is not corrupted, you can reinstall Ubuntu 16.04 LTS from a bootable medium such as a LiveUSB or DVD-ROM. You will be given the option to reinstall your OS, and keeping your Home folder files.\n\nA: You will get to choose between \"use entire disk\" and \"do something else\". You want to do \"something else\" and then choose the current 15.10 partition to format and install 16.04 on. Also, the current swap partition can be used again as a swap partition.

There are other Ubuntu flavors out there that may suit your system here\n\nA: I recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a 701 with 1GB RAM. I used the mini iso installer, added Xfce, PostgreSQL, Midori, emacs, git-all, musescore, abiword, swi-prolog, a few other things. \nI tend to remove /usr/share/docs/* and /var/apt/cache/archives/* as I go since I either already know what the tools I need do, or I have docs on another system, and I don't need to keep the debs around either. So, with the above installed, as well as some working space used in my home dir, I have 782MB left still.\nI am running the PostgreSQL server continuously. I am running a Catalyst server alongside that, being served by it (doing some development work). I can run Midori, several instances of the terminal, emacs, and other tools running in multiple tabs without ever having got to the point of it feeling sluggish. \nI did swap out the 1GB RAM for 2GB just so I knew I could have some extra headroom if I started to do anything really intense, but the above runs fine in 1GB. \nI've even driven my 27\" monitor at 1440x900 just fine as well as an extra screen, again with no appreciable lag or sluggishness.\nI am not running overclocked either. Just standard clock speed.\nAll is well - for me at least.

This is an Atom N270, which is a very similar in performance terms when compared to your N455, albeit the N270 is 32-bit and GPU-less. With 2GB of RAM, it's acceptable for casual use, although rendering web pages can be slow (e.g. when JavaScript kicks in). I wouldn't try LibreOffice on it for the same reasons.\nHowever, the OS itself is perfectly acceptable for navigation, window management, file management, and similar.\nLubuntu and the lightweight 'buntu derivatives will run any application that runs on full-fat Ubuntu, but you may find that you have to install e.g. additional Gnome libraries for some things.\n\nA: Recommended RAM is 2GB...so I would suggest you stick to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for optimum performance...IMHO and from experience...for 32bit machines with 1GB RAM, Ubuntu 12.04 runs the smoothest...so if you don't have any particular needs...do not upgrade...\n", "Q: \"mv\" apparently deleted my script!

You can also try to look for third-party repositories providing a Xenial package.\n\nA: Newer version of Canon driver (3.40) depends on \"libgcrypt20:i386\" and \"libgcrypt20-dev:i386\" packages.

Kindly help How do I upgrade my Ubuntu to 16.04 ? It is now 12.04. If I upgrade the version will it delete all my installed apps ? Kindly help.\n\nA: To upgrade from 12.04 to 16.04 you have to upgrade first to 14.04 and then to 16.04. It can be done by UpdateManager. But I would recomend a clean install. It would probably take less time than double upgrade. Backup your date before any of this actions. \nYou can upgrade Ubuntu from live USB key with 16.04. I thik it should offer you an option to upgrade from older versions. But I thing the programs you have installed will be lost.\n\nA: In addition to the other answers, an upgrade should leave your applications in place, although they themselves may need to be upgraded to work properly on the newer version: for example, the OS upgrade may bump the version of mysql, which could have implications for an installed application. Bear in mind that third-party PPAs will be disabled during any upgrade, so you'd need to check the sources files for Precise (vs Xenial) or edit the sources via the appropriate GUI tools (e.g. Synaptic).\nIt's actually good practice to not only do a clean installation but also use that process to document what and how you added afterwards. It makes migration and/or rebuilds much easier if you have decent notes, and saves the \"oh, hang on, what was that command/where did that script go?\" sensation much later on.\n(apologies for the separate answer, but I don't yet have the reputation to comment)\n\nA: You can upgrade from LTS to LTS with the command:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nYou would have to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 to 16.04.\nI recommend not doing this. A clean installation is best practice as it keeps your system fresh and generally improves performance. It is also far quicker.\nSadly, you cannot keep your programs, but they can be reinstalled (and should work better, given the upgrade). Backup your important data and port it after you have upgraded.\n\nA: I'd recommend upgrading only to 14.04 for the time being.  There have been many-many reports of problems with both upgrades and clean installs of 16.04 -- including my main desktop system, which I had to recover from backup after upgrading 14.04 to 16.04 resulted in failure to load the desktop.  You can remain supported on 14.04 until 2019, so you can ride that version until either 16.04 has its bugs ironed out, or 18.04 is ready.\n", "Q: How to prevent ubuntu from automatically mounting plugged in storage I am running ubuntu 14.04 LTS and sometimes I have to rescue data from failing storage.

Sometimes I have to unplug the hdd if is getting to hot / fails to much, freezing it down in the freezer, plug it in again, get some more sectors and so on. It may be destructive and a bad impact if ubuntu tries to access the hdd and waste time reading bad sectors.\nAnd what never (!) may happens is, that ubuntu mount an partition and writes anything (i.e. mount meta data) to it. The drive must be unchanged in any way.\nSo, how may I prevent ubuntu from automatically mounting / accessing plugged in storage?\n\nA: Install dconf-editor (if it is not already installed):\nsudo apt install dconf-editor\n\nthen run it\ndconf-editor\n\nNow from the left column go to org > gnome > desktop > media-handling.

However, after installing matlab-support like the posts above suggested, I also changed my video driver after reading GradBK's comment here Doesn't Matlab work on ubuntu 16.04? and it now works well.\n\nA: None of the provided answers did it for me, however i got Matlab R2016b to work by disabling gpu rendering to avoid the conflict in the first place.\nSimply launch matlab like this:\nmatlab -softwareopengl\n\nand you should be fine. I will continue to look for a more satisfying solution though.\n", "Q: Fan Control - Toshiba Satellite e45DW -c4210 Fans constantly running and making a ton of noise, I tried doing sensor-detect and got this at the end:\nSorry, no sensors were detected.\nThis is relatively common on laptops, where thermal management is\nhandled by ACPI rather than the OS.\n\nWhile using Windows it does not make this much noise. Can I just turn the fans down? There is no option in the bios for fan control.\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: So, I tried the drivers, and it said that my os is not compatible. I found that indicator-cpufreq helps, it looks like my cpu governor was set to performance, I can manually set the frequency and the laptop runs much quieter!\n\nA: This laptop comes with a Windows program called Health Monitor. When this runs it shows the CPU and GPU temperatures and the fan speed.

I'm looking for a portable version of Chrome (not Chromium) that I can work with on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I can only find Chromium or really outdated versions. Due to limitation on the machine I'm using, I cannot install Wine or utilize any admin features as I am on a standard account. Ideally, I would rather have an official version or at least one that exists in a repository that I can apt-get from. \n(I understand that apt-get requires sudo, I can use it for the initial vagrant setup, but that's all. Hence why I would need non-admin methods)\n\nA: Well, \"portable\" means almost nothing in the Linux world.\nYou can install any application anywhere on a system. If you do it carefully, in principle you can install any application and its dependencies on a USB stick with a ext partitioning and launch it on any Linux computer with the same architecture.\nIn particular, Chrome is already \"more\" portable, since it is entirely self-contained in /opt/google/chrome/.\nJust copy that directory somewhere else and you can launch it from anywhere.\n\nA: I made a bash script to make  Google Chrome portable in Ubuntu, Debian , Linux Mint or any linux supporting *.deb files. You can also run as many instances of Chrome as you wish.\nHere is the link and steps.

The second monitor is out of signal.\n\n\n*Ubuntu asks for my user password. Sometimes it appears on the first monitor, sometimes on the second monitor. However, only the first is active (so when it appears on the second monitor I have to guess it is there). Nonetheless, it still works like it is being displayed.\n\n\n*When using Ubuntu, only the first display will be active. I have to open the display setting, deactivate the second monitor (yes, Ubuntu thinks it is activated, even though it is not working), and the reactivate the second monitor.\nI have to do this every time I boot. Sometimes the monitor settings window appears at the second monitor (thus, I cannot change the settings).\nNow I've detached the second monitor and every time after boot I plug it in and then change the display settings.\nAny ideas of what the problem might be?\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem. I have two monitors, one on DVI, one on VGA. Everything worked fine with Kubuntu 15.10.\nNow, with 16.04, you can see that during the boot up, the VGA monitor stays black, but Ubuntu thinks it activated it.

The upgrade failed for an unknown reason and now the Ubuntu Desktop does not load. I get my desktop wallpaper and my icons but nothing else. It is however detecting both my monitors correctly. I'm guessing that there is a package that needs to be updated since the command line states 16.04 but the login screen still states 15.10. Does anyone have an idea how to rectify the issue?\nJake\n\nA: Unfortunately, this isn't uncommon with Ubuntu and seems to plague LTS releases worse than regulars for some reason.  The failing upgrade will cause things to get stuck halfway between releases, and you need to kick it in the shin to get it going again.\nAssuming you can get a command prompt on the system (CTRL-ALT-F1) and login as yourself, try the following things:\nFirst set ownership on your home directory.  Doubt that's the cause, but I've had it happen before:\nsudo chown -R yourlogin:yourlogin /home/yourlogin\n\nNext, try to finish the apt upgrade process:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf that errors, try running:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nAnd a last resort, force remaining package installs:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nAnd finally, clean up leftovers with:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n", "Q: Help uninstalling Ubuntu LTS First of all, I'm sorry if this specific question has been addressed, but I couldn't find all of the details I needed in other questions.\nI have Windows 10 installed on my C drive and Ubuntu LTS installed on my D drive. I want to uninstall Ubuntu LTS from my D drive as this is not my main computer anymore. \nFrom my understanding, I believe I can delete the partition on the D drive going through disk management in Windows? However, there are also files on my D drive that I don't want to lose. How can I ensure I don't lose any important files when I uninstall Ubuntu? \nThanks for any of the help, and I apologize if this answer can be found elsewhere.\nEdit: Some additional details I forgot to mention are I'm not trying to reinstall Windows onto the D drive, but just trying to delete Ubuntu off of it. Also, the D drive doesn't show up on my computer when I'm logged into Windows, but I believe it shows up under disk management as Disk 1. In disk management, there are two partitions, one that is about 250 megabytes and another that is around 370 gigabytes. I could delete the 250-megabyte partition as I believe that is the Ubuntu LTS OS? I just don't want to accidentally delete any of the other data on the drive as well.\n\nA: The basic steps will be:\n1 - Copy files from your D drive to somewhere that won't be deleted\n2 - Delete and repartition your drive to be a single drive again, (you will need repartitioning software for this and as far as I know it is not supported under Windows without third party software.  I'd suggest Gparted here to do this (make a USB stick with it, boot from there and repartition.\n3 - Boot back into windows and confirm it worked.\nNote:  Repartitioning used to be considered dangerous, as with all things it pays to have a backup, though this is fairly safe these days, there's still a chance.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: why unity 8 not any work, Is it illusion?

This format is supported directly in most OS's including Ubuntu and Windows, without installing any other applications.\nIf you want complete drive encryption you'll have to install a third party encryption app, which is cross-platform and/or offers dedicated app for the various platforms.\nVeraCrypt seems to be the current popular and most reliable(still in active development, is opensource) app for this.

Windows doesn't care because nothing of importance to Windows is on there (they're empty after all).\nThe cache integrated into your hybrid (solid state and hard disk) drives is either (1) inactive or (2) transparent which means that Ubuntu will (1) either not touch it unless told otherwise or (2) not be aware of it and the disk controller will just manage the cache without knowledge of or importance to the operating system of the hour.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Live-USB Casper Partition I had no issues with this in 15.04 or 15.10, so I suspect this is new to 16.04.\nI have frequently used the Universal USB Installer to create Live USBs with a casper-rw file for persistence. Once two of them are made, I boot to one, plug in the other, and resize the 2nd to make room for a casper-rw partition larger than 4gb.  Then I delete the casper-rw file in the primary installation partition.  This then allows the Live USB to have larger than 4gb persistent storage.\nI have performed this successfully a great many times with Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10.\nThat said, when I do this with 16.04 it breaks the Live installation.  It will no longer boot.  Has the process changed?\n\nA: I have been unable to use persistent partitions, (casper-rw or home-rw), with SDC or Unetbootin installs of 64bit post 12.04 Ubuntu.\nThe persistent partitions do work if I make the drive using a grub2/iso install using MultiBootUSB.

Is there a way to set up the encrypted partition so that it does not prevent the machine from booting into an SSH-able state (or require an encrypted swap which also needs to be unlocked with physical access at boot?)\nIt would be fine if it needs to be manually mounted after login, as long as I can safely do a sudo reboot without having to plug a monitor and keyboard in afterwards.\nUbuntu is being reinstalled anyway, so solutions that require making a new partition table are fine.\n\nA: As long as you ensure that non of the data on the encrypted partition is needed to enable a system boot you could just remove the reference to it from /etc/crypttab to stop it from being auto-mounted at boot. Alternatively you could leave the reference in place but add the noauto option.\nAs for the swap the easiest solution here is just to have it be encrypted using a random key each boot seeing as data on swap need not persist between reboots anyway this is perfectly fine you can use an entry like this in crypttab to do so:\nsda6_crypt /dev/sda6 /dev/urandom cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,swap,discard\n\nReplacing the sda6 with your physical swap partition.\n", "Q: HP Elitebook 840 G3 Monitor Issue I have a Elitebook 840 G3 with two external monitors exposed via a docking port.

I tried also to execute directly the command:\n\neval \"/usr/bin/exiftool $PATH_NAME\"\n\nBut same output error. Any idea to solve the problem? thanks.\n\nA: Instead of using simple strings, build your command using arrays. Arrays provide a convenient interface: If a is an array, then \"${a[@]}\" (note the quotes) expands into each element of a, without additional field splitting or globbing (so spaces, and things like wildcards, should remain intact).\nExample:\n$ a=(printf \"|%s|\\n\" \"foo   bar\" \"*\")\n$ echo ${a[@]}\nprintf |%s|\\n foo bar bin boot dev etc home lib lib64 lost+found mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var\n\nNote how the * was expanded, and how the extra spaces between foo and bar were lost. But with the \"${a[@]}\", these are preserved:\n$ echo \"${a[@]}\"\nprintf |%s|\\n foo   bar *\n\nThis is ideal for building commands. Now, you can do:\n$ \"${a[@]}\"\n|foo   bar|\n|*|\n\nSee? The arguments were retained perfectly.\nSo, do:\nCOMMAND=(/usr/bin/exiftool \"$PATH_NAME\")\n\"${COMMAND[@]}\"\n\n\nA: glenn jackman's point is well taken. But, to solve your immediate use case, how about backticks? Like so:\n`echo $COMMAND`\n\nFor example, this works:\nCOMMAND='ls /'\n`echo $COMMAND`\n\n\nA: For more detailed explanations about how Bash interprets spaces, I recommend to read this: Bash variables and command substitution\nClean solution\nExpanding a variable can lead to unexpected and sometimes catastrophic results if the variable contains special characters:\nuser@host:~$ do_something $some_variable\n\nExpanding a variable within double-quotes can prevent such problems:\nuser@host:~$ do_something \"$some_variable\"\n\nExplanation\nThe case encountered here is described at the end of the post:\n\nThe dangers of unquoted variables\nIn an ideal world, everyone would keep their string values short and without space/newline, or any other special characters.\n[...]\nBut when people start adding special characters to filenames, such as spaces, expanding variables, without the use of double quotes, can be dangerous.\n[...]\nSo the main takeaway here is: double-quote your variable references whenever possible.\n\n", "Q: How do I get the \"right\" LibreOffice Calc icon into the launcher? I just uninstalled the pre-installed LibreOffice from Ubuntu 16.04 and installed the 5.0.5-version. Now there occured a problem with the launcher icon that (I think) wasn't there before:\nThe icon shown for Calc has a very bad quality and always says that it is an untitled document, even when the opened document is clearly titled \n\nThis problem does not occur for the other LibreOffice programs, as you can see at the Writer-icon above the Calc-icon.\nWhen I search for LibreOffice in the Dash, two different possibilities show up for Calc \n\n\"untitled 1 - LibreOffice Calc\" and \n\"LibreOffice 5.0 Calc\"\nThe latter is the right one. But even when I click on it, it opens the first icon/application, although at first it shows the right (high-quality) icon in the launcher for a second. Both open the 5.0.5-version, but with the wrong icon and the wrong title. \nThe same problem occurs with LibreOffice Main.\nI have read a bit about icons in Unity at some websites (also this one), which lead me to the folder /usr/share/app-install/desktop, where I also found the \"ugly\" images, which are related to .xdesktop -files. Interestingly, in this folder, only the .xdesktop -file of Calc and Main have an icon at all, not the others. \nHas it got something to do with the files in the folder /usr/share/app-install/desktop/? What about the files in the folder /usr/share/icons? Is it related to the icon-theme, which I changed?\nDoes anyone know how I can get the right icon and the right Calc -application to be used? Is there possibly a remainder of the previous LibreOffice version on the system?\n\nA: Default directories for  launchers\nThe two default directories for .desktop files (launchers) are:\n/usr/share/applications\n\nfor gloablly installed applications, and\n~/.local/share/applications\n\nfor locally installed applications (~ stands for your home directory, /home/yourname) , or local versions of the launchers.\nAbout LibreOffice\nLibreOffice however is a bit of a stranger in our midst, if it comes to .desktop files. \nWhile the default (Ubuntu) version of LibreOffice stores its .desktop files, as usual, in \n/usr/share/applications\n\nthe downloaded version stores them in\n/usr/local/share/applications\n\nThat is, links to the launchers. The real launchers are in\n/opt/libreoffice5.0/share/xdg/\n\nWhat happened\nThere are two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Somehow, you have a local copy of the Libreoffice launcher in ~/.local/share/applications. If so, it will overrule all other occurrences of the same launcher (as mentioned, ~ stands for your home directory, /home/yourname). If so, remove the file(s), log out and back in.\n\n*the launcher in /usr/share/applications was left behind for some reason, by an error during uninstall. If the first option is not the case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to /usr/share/applications open a terminal window, type:\nsudo rm\n\nand subsequently drag the LibreOffice Calc launcher over into the terminal window in order to insert the file-directory. Then press Enter. Of course, you can also do that by typing the command:\nsudo rm /usr/local/share/libreoffice-calc.desktop\n\nand hitting Enter.\n\n*Log out and back in and it should be fixed.\n\nA: There was also the question about the images (icons) for LibreOffice. Well, even if that was directly asked: Personally I was searching for the folder containing that file countless times, and I always found this stackoverflow entry, which was not helpful in this regard. It mentioned the folder /usr/share/app-install/desktop, but that did not contain any files for me (Ubuntu 21.04).\nThus, in case anybody needs this as well: The libreoffice icons are stored in:\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps\n\n\nA: I had the same icon problem when I upgraded from LibreOffice to LibreOffice 7.2, the icons weren't applied to LibreOffice like every other app.  The solution was to go into the .desktop entry and remove the 7.2 wording\nRun each one of these at a time and change the entry to the below -\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-base.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-calc.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-draw.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-impress.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-math.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-startcenter.desktop\nsudo vim libreoffice7.2-writer.desktop\n\nHere is one example for writer:-\n  #Icon=libreoffice7.2-writer\n  Icon=libreoffice-writer\n\n", "Q: Cannot enter phpmyadmin as root (MySQL 5.7) I'm using Ubuntu desktop 16.04 (upgraded from 15.10).\nI had installed phpmyadmin from by apt-get install phpmyadmin.

And I was getting\n\n#1698 - Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'\n\nAll it took was to use phpmyadmin as user, not root, with the known password and it let me in.\n\nA: MySQL 5.7 changed the secure model: now MySQL root login requires a sudo.\nI.e., phpMyAdmin will be not able to use root credentials.\nThe simplest, safest and permanent solution will be create a new user and grant required privileges.\n1. Connect to mysql\nsudo mysql --user=root mysql\n\n2. Create a real password\nIn the below steps I'll use <please_replace_this> as a sample password. PLEASE, REPLACE IT BY YOUR PASSWORD! DON'T USE <please_replace_this> AS PASSWORD!\n3. Create a user for phpMyAdmin\nRun the following commands (replacing <please_replace_this> by the desired password):\nCREATE USER 'phpmyadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<please_replace_this>';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'phpmyadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nIf your phpMyAdmin is connecting to localhost, this should be enough.\n4. Optional and unsafe: allow remote connections\nRemember: allow a remote user to have all privileges is a security concern and this is not required in most of cases.\nWith this in mind, if you want this user to have the same privileges during remote connections, additionally run (replacing <please_replace_this> by the password used in Step #2):\nCREATE USER 'phpmyadmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<please_replace_this>';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'phpmyadmin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n5. Update phpMyAdmin\nUsing sudo, edit /etc/dbconfig-common/phpmyadmin.conf file updating user/password values in the following sections (replacing <please_replace_this> by the password used in Step #2):\n# dbc_dbuser: database user\n#       the name of the user who we will use to connect to the database.\ndbc_dbuser='phpmyadmin'\n\n# dbc_dbpass: database user password\n#       the password to use with the above username when connecting\n#       to a database, if one is required\ndbc_dbpass='<please_replace_this>'\n\n\nA: Referring to Rael Cunha:\nYes his solution works, and I have tried others. However, referring to a user having an exposed password on a configuration file like /etc/dbconfig-common/phpmyadmin.conf looks like a security flaw for a system-wide action.\nSo I would rather suggest in what MariaDB 10.1.x is concerned (some_user and some_pass will be anything you may come up with):\n# mysql -u root\nuse mysql;\nCREATE USER 'some_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \\*.\\* TO 'some_user'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nand leaving phpadmin setup (4) as is.\nLog in to phpmyadmin with your own credentials afterwards\nOn my own setups I replace the above '%' by 'localhost' for security purposes, but if you have port 3306 closed on your server that would not necessarily present a security risk to you.\n\nA: Only below code works for ubuntu 18.04, php 7 above and mysql 5.7\nCREATE USER 'phpmyadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'phpmyadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nDo not replace 'phpmyadmin'. Creating any other user does not have full privilege like create new user, assign database privileges to that user like that. Only phpmyadmin user will gain full access.\n\nA: if you install MySQL separate stop it by this command below\n    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop \n    service mysql stop \n    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp  start \n", "Q: Update led to black screen/cant log in to Ubuntu I got a message asking to update Ubuntu and started the update. \nThings were going fine but suddenly I got a blankscreen and, after a long wait and the laptop going quiet besides the fan, I had to switch it off.\nI switched it back on and just get the console, which I have little/no experience of.

However, I want to retain the recorded programs. 14.04 is using mythtv 0.27, whereas 16.04 uses 0.28 and documentation tells I should backup database before upgrading version. Can I restore the backup in 16.04 even if it is done by different version?\n\nA: Yes, I have done this when I moved from Mythbuntu 14.04 to Mythbuntu 16.04. I had the database backup (mythconverg-1317-20160708233351.sql.gz, automaticaly generated by the Mythbuntu 14.04 system) and the recordings on one drive, and then I installed Mythbuntu 16.04 on a different drive. I mounted the recordings in the same place in the filesystem as before. I stopped the backend and restored the database onto the Mythbuntu 16.04 system from the backup from the Mythbuntu 14.04 system.\nWhen I launched the frontend it displayed this message:\nWarning: MythTV wants to upgrade your database, for the Music schema, from 1020 to 1024\nI consented. After that it all worked fine, except when I went into Mythweb, when I got an error\n!!NoTrans: SQL Error: Expression #3 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause ...\nAs described at https://code.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/12713 I added the following lines to the end of /etc/mysql/conf.d/mythtv.cnf and it solved the problem:\nmax_connections=100\nsql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\n\nVaughan\n\nA: I don't believe so. You'll have to upgrade 14.04 to 0.28 first, then backup the database, install 16.04 and then restore.\nIt's possible that you can restore a 0.27 database to a 0.28 system and the backend will attempt to upgrade that when started, but I've not tested this.\n", "Q: I have only 9.54 GB root , I don't have space anymore. So I freed 15 GB disk in order to extend my root partition with it. But now unable to extend \nI want to allocate 15 gb free space to /dev/sda6. Can it be done without moving or any damage to system/data?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible if you use a live USB/CD system.\nStep by step guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find an USB drive with ~1.5 GiB of free space\n\n\n*\n\n*I highly recommend that you back up any important data from that USB drive before continuing\n\n\n*Download any recent Ubuntu image from the Download page (if you don't have one lying around already).\n\n*Launch the Startup Disk Creator application\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the downloaded Ubuntu image using the Other… button of the first section\n\n*Select your USB drive from the second list\n\n*Start installation by clicking on Make Startup Disk\nNow reboot and boot from the USB-Stick. Once you see the desktop on the USB system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the Internet as usual\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Install GParted as usual\n\n*Launch GParted\nNow start with the first NTFS partition (/dev/sda3):\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on it's entry in GParted's partition list\n\n*Select Resize/Move from the menu\n\n*In the dialog: Drag the partition from the right all the way to the left: \n\n*Confirm with the Resize/Move button in the bottom right\n\n\nNext you have to make the extended partition (/dev/sda4) larger:\n\n\n*\n\n*Again, right-click on it's entry and select Resize/Move from the menu\n\n*This time, in the dialog: Increase the size of the partition by dragging it's left handle all the way to the left: \nNow repeat everything you have done with the first NTFS partition (/dev/sda3) with the second NTFS partition (/dev/sda5).\nFinally repeat what you have done for the extended partition (/dev/sda4) for your root partition (/dev/sda6).\nThe final list of pending operation should look similar to this:\n\nOnce you're confident that you have done everything correctly, click on the Apply button, confirm the warning, and get a coffee. It'll take a while for the all operations to complete…\n\nA: You could use parted or gparted to do this from a live CD since the partitions must not be in use while this is done for extending this should be done before resizing the filesystem, when shrinking a partition you should first resize the filesystem then the physical partition.\nResizing the filesystem is done by resize2fs command if it is an ext[2-4] filesystem.\nUsually this is safe but there is always the risk that you could lose your data if external events cause the process to be interrupted such as a power failure so always back up critical data first.\n", "Q: Trouble installing PHP5 modules I followed this speed tutorial: https://www.liberiangeek.net/2015/11/how-to-easily-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-15-10/ but I got stuck at Step 4...  \nWhen I run following code in the terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd php5-intl php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php5-ming php5-ps php5-pspell php5-recode php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl\n\nI get following error messages from all packages:\nPackage \"name_of_package\" is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\nE: Package 'name_of_package' has no installation candidate\n...\n..\n.\nWhat should I do?

In Ubuntu 16.04, Evolution comes only with English language on a German installation. How can I install or configure the German language pack for Evolution.\n\nA: Evolution is a Gnome program. So if you are using Evolution in a Gnome-foreign distro (e.g. Kubuntu), it is likely that the needed language pack for Gnome programs is not installed. (In my case, the document viewer Evince also didn’t have an interface in my language, since it is also a Gnome program.)\nThus, you need to install the above mentioned language pack. You can do this e.g. via the terminal by typing (for your “German case”)\nsudo apt install language-pack-gnome-de\n\nIf someone wants a different language to be supported than German, then he/she/it has, of course, to change the letters after the last hyphen (e.g. to “it” for Italian).\nIf you are not sure what exactly the ending for your language is – or for any other reason – you can also install the package via a graphical package-management program like Synaptic. There, just search for “language-pack-gnome”, choose the package you need, and apply the changes (install it).\nYou have to re-open the program for the changes to be applied.\n\nA: If you are talking about the spell checker language I think you need to install the dictionary using the command:\nsudo apt-get install aspell-de\n\nAs for the interface language it seems there might be a bug with it at least this is reported for the RC not sure if it carried over into the final release:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/1572661\n\nA: Thanks to venbea (juan-gamez) and it works for all languages\nThis works fine for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Evolution evolution_3.18.5.2.orig.tar.xz from launchpad.net\n\n*Extract translation {LANG}.po for your language from po directory in archive\n\n*Convert .po file to .mo:\nmsgfmt -cv -o /path/to/evolution-3.18.mo /path/to/{LANG}.po\n\n\n*Copy evolution-3.18.mo to /usr/share/locale-langpack/{LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/evolution-3.18.mo\n\n*Restart Evolution, enjoy.\n\nA: If you happen to have a later version of evolution (3.20 for example) you can do the same:\nCopy your evolution-3.18.mo to \n/usr/share/locale-langpack/{LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/evolution-3.20.mo\n\nOr use the source of a more recent one, one that is not provided by Launchpad.\nIn my case it worked!\nThis really is a bug.

I was also having my mouse pointer real slow all of sudden in properly working Ubuntu 18.04. Googled like crazy for about an hour, tried restarting for few times, checked RAM and CPU usage it was not even half, try unplugging the mouse for couple of times, went through the mouse settings,\nFinally, found out the Zoom was switched on. Switched it off and worked like a charm.\nThe option can be found in Settings > Universal access.\n\n\nA: In my case with Parrot Linux it was a case of Interrupt conflicts. IRQ#18 kept being disabled by the system. After disabling the EHCI Handoff in the BIOS,ehci_hcd:usb1 was replaced with ehci_hcd:usb2 and the mouse lag after a random period of time stopped.\nYou can view your interrupt assignments with:\ncat /proc/interrupts\nMine changed from:\n18: IO-APIC  18-fasteoi   ehci_hcd:usb1, pata_jmicron, ata_piix, uhci_hcd:usb8\nto:\n18: IO-APIC  18-fasteoi   ehci_hcd:usb2, pata_jmicron, ata_piix, uhci_hcd:usb8\nAnd the problem was resolved.\n\nA: For me the solution was to bring the wireless dongle closer to the mouse (+keyboard) using a USB extension cord.\n\nA: I had the same problem when using Ubuntu 22.04.

I have a few apps that run at startup that launch full screen and when you minimize them they sit in the taskbar.. I used a program called gDevilspie which does have an option to skip_tasklist (Remove the window from the window list) not sure if this may work for what you want to do but I figured I would give you the information and let you give it a try.\nDownfall with it is, if you want to view one of them you have to stop gDevilspie or it will just remove it again ... like the one thing I have done this with has a tray icon and if I try to show the window .. it minimizes and hides the taskbar entry again... I have to stop the program to view the window again :( This program is good if its something that needs to be running all the time but no interaction needs to be done with it ..and you just want to hide it from view as if it was running as a service in the background or something.\nMy other suggestion would be to set up multi-workspaces and just move those windows to one of the desktops not in view and change it so that they dont show on all workspaces .. then the ones \"hidden\" on a non visible workspace will not show on your main workspace ... not sure if it will change the windows list though... it does with xubuntu.\n", "Q: Can I install apps in Ubuntu Touch without signing in? Trying to install an app from the Ubuntu Store, I was prompted for my Ubuntu username and password. I couldn't find a way to install apps without signing up. I was surprised, as it seems a bit contrary to the Free Software movement.\nIs there a way?\nIf not, why is it compulsory?\n\nA: No, you cannot install apps from the store without signing in to an Ubuntu One account. You can however install packages manually from the command line, ignoring signatures. Installing apps in such a manner can present a security risk.\nThere are several things which require an Ubuntu One account, and installing/updating apps is only part of that. An Ubuntu One account is also required to submit reviews, submit bug reports about the system on the https://launchpad.net/ site, and an account is needed in order to receive push notifications from the apps which support it.\nThe account is required for installing apps, also to allow certain features in the future, such as remote install via web, re-installation of installed apps on new/reflashed/other devices, and blacklisting revocation of malicious apps which may have been installed.\nApps which are \"free\" may also use in-app purchases, and an account is required for this feature to work properly, even if you do not wish to purchase anything. The high level QtPurchasing API for this is very limiting, and requiring an account to install the app helps ensure the account exists while the app is used, as well.\n\nA: Apparently, there is a way, but it is not for the faint-hearted. I have a similar thread here.\nThe Ubuntu touch 'click' packages\nYou can use adb shell to install click packages, once you find those packages and are happy about their origin.\nTo get adb installed, you can follow the \"Prepare your desktop\" section of the ubuntu touch installation howto.\nOnce you have adb, enable debugging on the device (System settings, About, Developer mode = On), connect the device using usb and run on your host:\nadb devices\n\nYou'll get a listing indicating that the device is offline. Don't despair, there will be a confirmation dialog shown on your device to allow the particular host to access the device. Once you confirm, the device will talk. Then run:\nadb shell\n\nThis gets you shell access (and root through sudo) to the tablet. You can then install ANY click package. Any that you can get hold of, which is somewhat spookey...\npkcon install-local --allow-untrusted FILES\n\nI've been advised that you can compile the click packages from source, but I'm hoping to figure out some simple way to locate the distributed free sw packages.\nDebian/Ubuntu packages\nYou can switch the filesystem to write mode (careful, there be dragons!) and do the usual apt-get things. You know it's not advised because that will render your system unsupported by automatic updates and you risk losing your modification. Heck I can live with that...\nI have found another interesting resource on using custom made app container with Libertine. I haven't tried that myself yet, but it might give you some ideas. Here's some introduction to libertine containers.\nWhy?\n... I wonder! To answer your second question, why is it compulsory to have the 'one' account, I can only plot some assumptions for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is work to do to support anonymous operation, so it hasn't been done yet (my hopeful favorite)\n\n*The authors actually do want to track you for what ever reason (I wish this is not the case)\n\n", "Q: not all RAM recognised ~3.3 of 8GB \n*\n\n*I recently installed some new RAM so that I have 8GB (4x2GB sticks).\n\n*The Bios displays all four sticks, however Ubuntu only shows about 3.3GB available.\n\n*Both the system details and info from terminal tell me that it is a 64bit OS\n\n\nI am currently running memtest86 v5.01 - no errors so far but still on its first pass.

Motherboard is compatible with 8GB RAM, as is CPU I believe.\nThanks for the help\n\nA: It was a BIOS firmware problem, While the motherboard supported 8gb of RAM, the motherboard firmware (Dell) didn't.\nAfter updating this it worked - for anyone reading who has a Dell Inspiron 530, with a foxconn g33m motherboard, I did have to use HPUSBDISK tool to create a DOS usb to flash the bios, as I received memory errors when I used Rufus\n\nA: This could be a hardware or a BIOS firmware problem.\n First if all I'd try to identify that the RAM modules are OK, by putting the new ones into slots 0-1 (or which definitely work). If that doesn't help, I would check the modules on another motherboard. If that doesn't help, I'd try to update the BIOS firmware. If that sounds too risky, try replacing the modules in the shop and get some new ones.\n", "Q: Is there a way to manually invoke the on-screen keyboard?

There's no edit menu.\nDoes the concept of a clipboard exist in Ubuntu Touch? How do I use it?\n\nA: Many places in Ubuntu touch pressing and holding a word does select the word and bring up a context menu with options such as select all, copy etc. just like other mobile OSes. For example the Ask Ubuntu app I'm writingbthis in behaves that way.\nThe Notes app on my M10 does not. I'm tempted to say it's a bug.\n\nA: With OTA-13, using the Notes app on the M10, I still can't get the option to copy the whole text. It only allows me to copy one word at a time.

You cant hold it down or you will get a keyboard error this is why you have to rapidly tap the F10 key. There is a very small window in which to catch it.

Check your repositories, odds are you are pulling updates from either a newer repository that has regressions, or an older repository that isn't as up to date as you need to run the game and install the driver.\n", "Q: What is the difference between xdg-app and snaps? GNOME Sandboxed Apps seems to be very similar to Ubuntu snap packages.  What are the key differences between these formats?\nLike, GNOME Sandboxed Apps requires Wayland and therefore is inherently more secure than snap package which doesn't require any protocol for graphics (ie snaps can run on X Server which is inherently insecure).\nAre snaps just another case where Canonical has decided to do their own thing?\n\nA: Moving to and fro between Snap and flatpack(Gnome follows this) will change the development philosophy.\nFlatpak was laid by Leonard Potterhead, who broke too many POSIX decorums because he believed in fast Linux development process.\nFollowing is sum up for the question, but the question is very broad, so trying to pick up few points.\n\n\n*\n\n*Snap is has single corporate backup Canonical while Flatpak has many.\n\n*Snap is strictly following the POSIX philosophy.\n\n*Flatpak is no server process while snappy has [in most of cases].\n\n*Flatpak has library dependencies from Freedesktop,KDE,GNOME while\nsnap has Base distro snap.\n\n*Flatpak cannot run without sandboxing, while snap is optional.\n\n*Flatpak is optimized for air-gapped (offline) machines (the kind Ed\nSnowden uses) but snap is not.\n\n*Flatpak is fully decentral without the central gatekeepers while in\ncase of snap, it is no.(a single app store)\n\n*Flatpak allows application authors to self-host application with no\nfunctionality loss while in snap it does not.\n\n\nStill researching on this question, fewer answers\n", "Q: What can I do to fix this error on grub-efi? I have a dual boot system setup with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04, when turning on my PC grub shows correctly, Windows and Ubuntu are recognized, no problems there. Every time there's an update or i have to install something, I keep getting this error:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n grub-efi-amd64-signed\n shim-signed\nSetting up shim-signed (1.12+0.8-0ubuntu2) ...\nInstalling for x86_64-efi platform.\ngrub-install: errore: cannot find EFI directory.\ndpkg: error processing package shim-signed (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nSetting up grub-efi-amd64-signed (1.66+2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3) ...\ngrub-install: errore: /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/modinfo.sh doesn't exist.

(For an EFI-mode installation on AMD64/x86-64, the equivalent path is /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/modinfo.sh.) OTOH, the package names clearly indicate an EFI-mode GRUB install. The two should not be mixed, but somehow that's happened in your case. Perhaps you've got a leftover GRUB configuration file from a previous BIOS-mode install, in which case tracking it down and updating it should fix the problem. Perhaps Boot Repair could fix the problem automatically. Note, however, that a repair attempt runs the risk of making matters worse by rendering your system unbootable. I therefore advise proceeding with extreme caution!\nIf you can't fix it easily, you could look into replacing GRUB with something else -- several alternatives are available, as described on this Web page of mine. GRUB 2 is the most difficult boot loader to tweak once it goes \"off the rails,\" as yours has, which is why replacing it can be a good option. My own rEFInd boot manager is likely to be easy to install, with the caveat that there's an Ubuntu 16.04 bug that complicates installation from the PPA with Secure Boot active. (That's covered in the documentation.) Note also that simply installing a new package won't overcome your problem; you'd need to uninstall the GRUB package that's causing you difficulty to do that. I cover that topic specifically here, since it's not as easy as you might think. (Ubuntu keeps trying to re-install GRUB if you remove it.)\n\nA: try: \nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nthen: this terminal command will remove the shim-signed archive \n\nafter: with the shim archive removed successfully \n\nfinally: at least the Ubuntu software updates should start working again if it all goes well (as in my case) \n\n", "Q: On Aquarius M10 Ubuntu Tablet— Tab-Complete with Virtual Keyboard? In the Terminal Application on the Aquarius M10, is there a capability similar to Tab-Complete when using the on-screen virtual keyboard?\n\nA: I think it's sufficient to tap on the terminal window to send a TAB.\n\nA: You can swipe to the right on the console area and that will tab-complete. I assume it's sending a tab character.\n\nA: Added to the \"swiping right\" you can also find a TAB key within the terminal. You have to hold the layout icon (orange area on the bottom left here: Terminal on Ubuntu Touch) and select SCR. You'll get a selection of keys with tab amongst them.\n\nA: I am used to vi as command editor but Tab-complete works fine for me in the on-screen keyboard. \nYou have to switch to a different 'layout' as it is called in the keyboard/terminal settings. This is the white-on black ribbon above the keys and you can choose one with a TAB key by holding down the keypad symbol on the left side of the ribbbon and selecting \"SCR\".\nEdit: I didn't know about the swipe or tap and that turns out to work just fine.\n", "Q: Can samba validate a domain user for a shared folder I can use smbpass to create samba users, but can Samba also validate domain users?\nMy smb.conf:\n[share]\npath = //\navailable = yes\nread only = no\nbrowseable = yes\npublic = yes\nwritable = yes\n\n\nA: The first step is to install winbind (If not already installed) a simple \nsudo apt-get install winbind \n\nShould do the job, but I cant confirm that while i'm at work.

With a type of nfs4 this option is ignored, but can be used with mount -O _netdev in scripts later. Currently Ubuntu Server does not come with the scripts needed to auto-mount nfs4 entries in /etc/fstab after the network is up.\n\nMy solution was to the add \"vers=3\" before \"_netdev\", forcing the connection to use NFS v3. Obviously this might not help in your case, if you are relying on NFS v4.\nOther options could include AutoFS or shell scripting.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 LTS from 15.10 I face this error when trying to upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 LTS (from 15.10).

It shows\nDesktop Entry Created\nYou may now exit IDEA and start it from the system menu (restart a session if a new entry seem not to appear).\n\nbut after closing IDEA (without manually locking the icon to launcher), the icon is also removed. I have deleted the desktop entry under ~/.local/share/applications according to this thread Stack Overflow: Intellij launcher doesn't work on unity?\nThen I tried\nchmod 777 /usr/share/applications/jetbrains-idea.desktop\n\nand dragged it to launcher, which still doesn't work.\nJAVA_HOME and PATH are both set up correctly.\n\nA: I was finally able to fix this by myself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure JAVA_HOME is set correctly in the profile of your shell. For instance, I'm using zsh so I have to add export JAVA_HOME=/..... in ~/.zshrc\n\n*If you specified any jar file to run as javaagent in idea.vmoptions, make sure to specify its full path name. \n\n*Simply create .desktop file from IDEA or manually and point Exec parameter to the full path of your idea.sh file. Then drag it to the launcher. Works fine.\n\nA: Let us create and install a new desktop file idea.desktop which is a shortcut file for IntelliJ IDEA. \n$ vi ~/idea.desktop\nType the following in the shortcut file idea.desktop using the editor:\n[Desktop Entry]                                                                 \nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=IntelliJ IDEA\nComment=IntelliJ IDEA\nExec=/opt/idea/bin/idea.sh\nIcon=/opt/idea/bin/idea.png\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=IntelliJ IDEA\n\nNow, run the following command to install idea.desktop file in /usr/share/applications/ directory:\n$ sudo desktop-file-install idea.desktop\n\nNever directly copy shortcut file into /usr/share/applications/ directory. If there are any errors  in shortcut file such as idea.desktop who is going to catch them? That is why we install using above command rather than cp command.  Command desktop-file-install is capable of catching errors!\n\nIn order to complete this answer, let us create a symlink in /usr/local/bin directory:\n$ cd /usr/local/bin/\n$ sudo ln -s /opt/idea/bin/\n\nAlternatively, as the IntelliJ IDEA executable binary is located under /opt/idea/bin, we can also add its parent directory to our $PATH so that we can launch the program without specifying the absolute path to the binary file.\n$ vi ~/.bashrc\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/idea/bin\"\n\nI had similar shortcut issues while installing Netbeans 10.0, please refer After installation, Netbeans 10.0 won't run from Ubuntu 18.04 desktop\n\nA: There is no option as of right now for automatic pinning of the .desktop file to the launcher of an application that was just installed. It does not just include IntelliJ but many other applications. \nTechnically speaking , there are ways to append an icon to the list of icons on the launcher , however most developers don't use it and leave that option up to the user. Hence you have to manually pin the Launcher icon. Otherwise, once the program exits - the icon disappears from launcher, which is the proper behavior of any app that is not on the list of the launcher favorites.\nAs for the .desktop file itself - it is created. \n\nChecking only the Create a desktop entry option creates the file in ~/.local/share/applications/ folder, which is typically where the launcher entries for unknown or user-specific apps go.\nTo confirm that , I've ran this after installation:\n$ ls ~/.local/share/applications | grep idea\njetbrains-idea-ce.desktop\n\nChecking For all users option will create /usr/share/applications/jetbrains-idea-ce.desktop,  since the /usr/share/applications directory is available globally to all users.\nEither of these is what you want, and they can be pinned to the launcher simply by dragging them from file manager or dash to the launcher. NOTE: the bin/idea.sh must be ran as your regular user - otherwise if you run it as root, the .desktop file will be root owned, hence you cannot drag that to the launcher. If that's the case, you can always sudo chown $USER:$USER /path/to/jetbrains-idea-ce.desktop\nYou can always copy either of those to Desktop if that's what you want, but .desktop files aren't literally supposed to be on the desktop.\nAs a last resort, you can always manually create a .desktop file. \nIn my example, that would be\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=/bin/sh /home/xieerqi/intellij/idea-IC-145.597.3/bin/idea.sh\nName=Intellij\nIcon=/home/xieerqi/intellij/idea-IC-145.597.3/bin/idea.png\n\nNotice , that this is different from the example in the link you provided . The #!/usr/bin/env xdg-open is unnecessary and Exec line actually runs /bin/sh and the idea.sh as parameter to it. Note that this .desktop file needs to have executable permissions, otherwise you will receive a warning \"Untrusted application\"\n\nA: simply u can:       \n\n\n*\n\n*run ./idea.sh again from terminal (like when u were installing but u won't install)  \n\n*then it will open the application, press on \"configure\".  \n\n*press create desktop entry :D \n\n\nA: May be I'm too late by anyways. \nIdea 19.1 is creating entry which is in the file jetbrains-idea.desktop. when I hit launcher and try to find via typing idea it's not showing. Once I've made a copy of a file:\ncp /usr/share/applications/jetbrains-idea.desktop /usr/share/applications/idea.desktop\n\nit has started showing. \n", "Q: Realtek RTL8188EE drivers in Xenial?

If you use the unifying receiver that came with the mouse it will already be paired when you plug it in. If you wish to pair to a pre-existing unifying receiver you should install Solaar, which provides basic control over pairing, and limited configuration options for some Logitech peripherals.\nI used a pre-existing unifying receiver, and paired my MX Master to it using Solaar.  It does detect battery strength, but does not provide configuration of gestures, dpi, scrolling, etc.  The mouse's standard configuration seems to be fine, except that it would really be nice if I could configure the hidden thumb button to switch workspaces for me. The hidden thumb button creates a key sequence, so I guess I could map that sequence within Linux to do workspace swaps.\nAnyway, aside from minimal support for configurability, it works great.\nI have also paired it using Bluetooth. Doing so required installing blueman and trusting the device.\nAs an update: The MX Master continues to work under Ubuntu 17.04 just as it did under Ubuntu 16.xx versions. I've also been using it under 18.xx and 19.xx.\n\nA: This answer is supposed to be for a MX Anwhere 2, but it worked for my MX Master.\nOpen bluetoothctl, then:\n[bluetooth]# power off\n[bluetooth]# power on\n[bluetooth]# scan on\n[bluetooth]# connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n[Arc Touch Mouse SE]# trust\n[Arc Touch Mouse SE]# connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\n[Arc Touch Mouse SE]# pair\n[Arc Touch Mouse SE]# unblock\n[Arc Touch Mouse SE]# power off\n[bluetooth]# power on\n\n\nA: I have connected my Logitech MX Master via bluetooth using blueman-applet.\n$ sudo apt-get install blueman\n\nThen open it:\n$ blueman-applet\n\nIf you have mouse on the list, remove, scan again and connect it.\nThat's how i fixed it after hours of searching on Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: its works on ubuntu 18.04 i use hcitool to find my logitech M590 mac address\n\nhcitool lescan\n\nthen gatttool to get mouse visible \n\ngatttool -i hci0 [xx.xx.xx ... mac address] -I\n\nhttps://ericasberry.com/blog/2016/09/30/pairing-a-logitech-mx-master-mouse-with-ubuntu-16-04-using-bluetooth/\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu machine from another machine which is already upgraded? I have two machines which run Ubuntu. I have already upgraded one machine to Ubuntu 16.04. I don't want to download the packages again because it takes hell lot of time. Can I use downloaded packages in first machine to upgrade my second machine?\n\nA: You could use something like apt-cacher-ng on the first machine and then import the packages from apt's cache into apt-cacher-ng using the following instructions:\nhttps://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/howtos.html#imp\nYou can find the local archive cache in the following location:\n/var/cache/apt/archives\nThen just tell the second machine to use apt-cacher-ng on the first machine as an apt proxy, if you set up both machines to use it as a proxy this will also ensure you will only need to download packages once for future updates too saving you and the ubuntu mirrors time and bandwidth.\n", "Q: Why so many \"removed but not purged\" packages?

I have followed all the instructions (booting from live media, then using the install option, taking care to setting the grub to point at the external usb drive (in my case sdc1).The installation proceeds normally however the grub is written to the internal HDD drive. Fortunately I know how to recover the grub and to boot normally. But something is wrong. I don't want to open my laptop to unplug the internal HDD. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I faced the same problem with my Lenovo ideaPad Z50-75 Win10 OS. I was able to do the installation on my external USB HDD after disabling the secure boot and enabling legacy system from BIOS. I also installed the boot loader on the same external USB HDD. Updating Ubuntu sw (after installation) messed up the root system, which was easily fixed with initramfs fsck-command. However, if changing the boot order in BIOS the system could not read the Win OS HDD (a SATA drive in my case). The other problem was that I could not connect to internet via wifi (probably something to do with Broadcom driver and USB HDD connection). The wired connection worked fine. One more problem was that the Ubuntu boot loader could not start Win OS (pointing to wrong address ...). Removing the installation is no problem: you can delete the Ubuntu boot loader from BIOS for example with easyUEFI (free sw). After that you can return the BIOS settings to original values and everything should work fine with Win OS.\n", "Q: Bluetooth speaker no sound in Ubuntu 16.04 After upgrading to Kubuntu 16.04 my JBL Flip 2 bluetooth speaker no longer works.\nIt connects just fine, and the sound is set to use A2DP sink with the speaker, but I get no sound.\nI found some places claiming I had to change /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf, but that file no longer exists.\nDoes anyone know how I get it to work again?\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to 16.04.  For me, there isn't a real fix, but I can get the speaker to work. I'm running Kubuntu so these steps are for KDE, and I'm not sure what the equivalent Unity steps are, but I'd imagine they're similar. \nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let the speaker connect.\n\n*In your audio settings, change the profile to \"Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP)\" or equivalent\n\n*Power off Disconnect the speaker\n\n*Restart the bluetooth service \nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\n*Power the speaker back on and reconnect\n\n*In your audio settings, change the profile back to \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)\" or equivalent\n\nA2DP should now work. So far, it seems that things only go wrong when I try to connect in A2DP mode. Until there is a real fix/workaround, I am going to try to remember to always switch to HSP/HSF mode before powering off or disconnecting the speaker. \nUPDATE:\nIt's sufficient to connect, switch to HSP/HFP mode, disconnect, reconnect, and switch back to A2DP mode. There is no reason to restart the bluetooth service.\n\nA: I had the issue. For me worked to remove the bluetooth device and search for it again and reconnect.\n\nA: After testing all workarounds, i wrote a python script to change profile, disconnect, reconnect and set profile to a2dp.\nrun it after pair/turning-on the device with python3.5.\nhttps://gist.github.com/pylover/d68be364adac5f946887b85e6ed6e7ae#file-a2dp-py\nEDIT 1\n$ python3.5 a2dp.py \nConnection MADE\nSelecting device:\nDevice MAC: 00:22:37:3D:DB:1A\nDevice ID: bluez_card.00_22_37_3D_DB_1A\nSink: bluez_sink.00_22_37_3D_DB_1A\nTurning off audio profile.\nDisconnecting the device.\nConnecting againt.\nSetting A2DP profile\nDevice ID: bluez_card.00_22_37_3D_DB_1A\nUpdating default sink\nExiting bluetoothctl\n\n", "Q: Intel Nuc Nuc5i3ryh on Ubuntu 16.04 do you know if Intel Nuc Nuc5i3ryh will work with Ubuntu 16.04?

Wiped off Windows 10, with immense joy by the way, and installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and the Cinnamon desktop. This is a sweet laptop combo.\nThe default setting is to dim the keyboard back light after 10 seconds of no key press. This was driving me absolutely crazy because I fly a lot and want the back light to stay on longer.\nThe file /sys/devices/platform/dell-laptop/leds/dell\\:\\:kbd_backlight/stop_timeout contains the back light timeout value.\nAnswer 3 (above) did not work for me because the echo command did not work, even as root. Instead I did the following:\nsudo nano /sys/devices/platform/dell-laptop/leds/dell\\:\\:kbd_backlight/stop_timeout \n\nchange the 10s on line-1 to 300s (Without quotes). This will change the timeout to 5 minutes. Change it to whatever you wish.\nSave the file (Ctrl-O, Enter, Ctrl-X).\nHope this helps someone as frustrated with this as I was.\n\nA: I used to have my Dell Vostro 3560 keyboard-backlight constantly turned on after reboot, even if I had it turned off. \nThe fix was in /etc/UPower/UPower.conf. I changed IgnoreLid=false to IgnoreLid=true.\nThat helped.\n\nA: I have run into this problem on Ubuntu 22.04.1 with Mate.\n\n*\n\n*Pressing <Fn>+<Space> is not permanent because Mate overrides the backlight setting when the screen is unlocked.\n\n*Tweaking systemd does not help.\n\nSolution\nI have solved the problem by doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*Run gsettings list-recursively | grep --color kbd to find relevant settings. In the output, you will find these rows:\n\norg.mate.power-manager kbd-backlight-battery-reduce true\norg.mate.power-manager kbd-brightness-dim-by-on-battery 50\norg.mate.power-manager kbd-brightness-dim-by-on-idle 75\norg.mate.power-manager kbd-brightness-on-ac 100\n\n\n\n*Change kbd-brightness-on-ac to 0 and kbd-backlight-battery-reduce to false by running:\n\ngsettings set org.mate.power-manager kbd-brightness-on-ac 0\ngsettings set org.mate.power-manager kbd-backlight-battery-reduce false\n\nNow the keyboard backlight will stay off when you unlock the screen.\n", "Q: Secure boot ON/OFF while installing ubuntu 16.04 alongside windows 10 I wanna dual boot ubuntu 16 alongside windows 10.

In other words, if I closed the file manager after copying the files from the first directory, the system clears out the copied files and thus stopping me from pasting them into the other directory.

I'm about to upgrade from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS, but first I need to sort out the systemd services for most important software I use, like OpenVPN client. I have a perfectly working upstart script for 14.04. \nI read a lot about systemd, but have no too much experience. From another post I also understand the following: \n\nOpenVPN is a templatized service under systemd. The services are named\n  openvpn@config.service. So you should be starting your\n  /etc/openvpn/myvpn.conf instance with\nsystemctl start openvpn@myvpn.service\n\nI compile OpenVPN Client. I just don't get this, is openvpn@myvpn.service automatically generated, or how? Further to this, how can I add Restart settings (or any other) to this service, in this case openvpn@myvpn.service? I would like to add\nRestart=On-failure \nAs recommended on freedesktop.org: \n\nSetting this to on-failure is the recommended choice for long-running\n  services, in order to increase reliability by attempting automatic\n  recovery from errors. For services that shall be able to terminate on\n  their own choice (and avoid immediate restarting), on-abnormal is an\n  alternative choice.\n\nMy aim is to OpenVPN client to restart always if not stopped by me.\n\nA: Regarding the \"openvpn@myvpn.service\" part of your question, another example: I have an OpenVPN configuration file named /etc/openvpn/Germany.conf so I start the openvpn daemon with systemctl start openvpn@Germany.service. This is my default config, so it goes into /etc/default/openvpn.\nIn case my german gateway is down, I have another configuration file /etc/openvpn/Netherlands.conf and to use that I call systemctl start openvpn@Netherlands.service\nRegarding the Restart setting, this probably goes into the [Service] section of /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openvpn.service though I haven't tested that myself.\nNote: The above assumes that you use the Ubuntu package via apt-get install openvpn. I'm not sure what happens when you compile the stuff yourself? Also: Why would you do that?\n\nA: \nFurther to this, how can I add Restart settings (or any other) to this\n  service, in this case openvpn@myvpn.service?\n\nFrom https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html (emphasis mine):\n\nAlong with a unit file foo.service, a \"drop-in\" directory\n  foo.service.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix \".conf\" from this\n  directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed. This is\n  useful to alter or add configuration settings for a unit, without\n  having to modify unit files. Each drop-in file must have appropriate\n  section headers. Note that for instantiated units, this logic will\n  first look for the instance \".d/\" subdirectory and read its \".conf\"\n  files, followed by the template \".d/\" subdirectory and the \".conf\"\n  files there. Also note that settings from the \"[Install]\" section are\n  not honored in drop-in unit files, and have no effect.\nIn addition to /etc/systemd/system, the drop-in \".d\" directories for\n  system services can be placed in /usr/lib/systemd/system or\n  /run/systemd/system directories. Drop-in files in /etc take precedence\n  over those in /run which in turn take precedence over those in\n  /usr/lib. Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence\n  over unit files wherever located.\n\nBased on above, if you had more than one openvpn configuration and you would like to alter some aspect of configuration for all openvpn services based on these configurations you would need to create /etc/systemd/openvpn@.service.d directory and place there appropriate .conf files.\nIf you want to alter specific openvpn service like openvpn@myvpn.service in your case then you have to create /etc/systemd/openvpn@myvpn.service.d directory and place there appropriate .conf files.\n", "Q: Elantech Touchpad not working on Ubuntu 16.04 and Arch Linux So I have and Asus R558UF notebook with an Elantech Touchpad.\nAfter installing Ubuntu 16.04, the touchpad worked once but after restarting, it failed to work and has not been working ever since.\nThis is output of xinput:\n ↳ Elan Touchpad                            id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nIn Mouse and Touchpad settings, the touchpad is enabled.\nWhat should I do to fix this?\n\nA: I have the same touchpad on an ASUS laptop. Linux kernels below 4.5 don't have the drivers for this touchpad, so all you have to do is upgrade your kernel. Even though Linux kernels go all the way to 4.10 as of this writing, I like to trail the edge of technology, so if you just go to 4.5, you should be good.\nYou can find the latest kernels for Ubuntu at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nFor example, to upgrade to 4.5.7, you would go to the ubuntu kernels link above and click into http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.5.7-yakkety/\nThen, download the generic .deb packages.

Mixing boot modes (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI) is seldom a good idea. In your case, it's best to enter your firmware setup utility and disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is what gives EFI firmware the ability to run old BIOS-mode boot loaders. Doing this should reduce the odds of accidentally doing what you seem to have done. An EFI-mode run of Boot Repair should complete correctly and get things working. For more on the CSM and how it can cause problems, see my Web page on the subject.\n", "Q: NetworkManager asks for password repeatedly [802.1x][16.04] I recently updated form 15.10 to 16.04, I live on a campus, and we have to sign in for internet through 802.1x.

In all of my tests I have been connected successfully.\nInterestingly the password then persists between log-ins and the \"Password\" section of 802.1x Security tab is populated.\n\nA: I also have same problem.\nStrangely, the wired network won't work, while the wireless network can connect to a 802.1x network.\nAnyway, in my case, I can not fix it, but can workaround by modify the interface file\nLet the NetworkManager bypass the interface.\nIn the /etc/network/interface file\nauto enp0s25\niface enp0s25 inet dhcp\n       wpa-driver wired\n       wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_wired.conf\n\nand in your /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_wired.conf file\nnetwork={\n    key_mgmt=IEEE8021X\n    eap=PEAP\n    phase2=\"auth=MACHAPV2\"\n    identity=\"youridentity\"\n    password=\"yourpassword\"\n}\n\nIn my case, I can connect to network temporary.\n\nA: There is a typo in Jiang Junyu's answer, but it works anyway. \nauth=\"MSCHAPV2\"\nnetwork={\n    key_mgmt=IEEE8021X\n    eap=PEAP\n    phase2=\"auth=MSCHAPV2\"\n    identity=\"youridentity\"\n    password=\"yourpassword\" }\n\n\nA: I have a similar problem.I use wired 802.1x auth wich works fine with ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04 .In 16.04 works only if i write in clear text the password (password='mypassword')  in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/myconn.\n\nA: I had a similar situation. Seemingly my wired 802.1x connection would loop where I enter my credentials and it would try to load and then just bring up the password screen again without telling me my credentials were wrong. This is characteristic to incorrect CA certificate.\nTo fix it, follow one of the following below:\nIf you are using CA Certificates, make sure you get it from school's IT center (in my case the certificate from the previous semester was no longer valid). Once you have the CA certificate, add the path of the location of this certificate in the following location.\netc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Name_of_your_connection \n\nFind the block of text that looks similar to below \n[802-1x]\naltsubject-matches=\nca-cert=/path/to/your/CA_certificate\neap=peap;\nidentity=YourUsername\n\nYou can of course require no CA certificate. Edit your connection through 'Network Connection' GUI and check 'No CA Certificate Required' or delete (if exits) the line \nca-cert=/path/to/your/CA_certificate\n\nin\n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Name_of_your_connection4\n\nLastly, you can try to get the CA certificate from your colleagues at school who have it working or if you have a Windows OS you can grab the certificate from there. (I'm not too familiar with Windows but this solution worked for me because somehow windows acquired the correct certificate when I set it up on campus). But go to Certificate Manager in Windows OS and open the file labeled Trusted Root Certificate Authorities > Certificates. This might be specific for my school but export the USERTrust RSA Certificate.cer and load it into your ubuntu distro.\nCheers\n", "Q: \"Mark as read\"-button in Claws Mail?

I'm tring to reinstall with different images and boot media, but still have the same result.\nAfter first boot all work like a charm. But if you want to shutdown or restart (by systemctl or sutdown command) system going to shutdown/restart but can't do it correctly. Then I have 2 cases:\n1) If you have a lot of patience system will finish do what you want still 7-10 minutes. After that (SIC!) on next boot you will see the GINGER (ubuntu collour) tty1. Which can switch to normal colours after running mc or some commands like < fdisk -l>. All other ttys have normal white colour. Almost all next reboots/shutdowns work correctly(under 5seconds), tty1 still ginger after boot. But sometimes can see timing problem.\n2)If you haven't patience and \"help\" system pressing SysRq combinations or hardware poweroff button you will see (on next boot) normal tty1. And all next reboots/sshutdowns works fine. \nP.S. I Use different ISOs, flashdrives/SDs. System was installed on true hardware raid on zeroed MBR partition. During install my choice:\nstandard utils,\nserver utils,\nLAMP,\nSAMBA,\nOpenSSH.\nI don't use any mouse, keyboard, monitor. Headless server managed by ILO3.\nPrevious Ubuntu 14.04LTS works like a charm for me on this hardware.\n\nA: Resolved. 1) I should not use boot flash creators like unetbootin with server verion 16.04LTS. When I try to install by adding iso image to virtual cdrom (ILO sweet feature) I see another result. OS show visible POST when loading modules. After boot I have normal terminals. It also resolve bug with default tty7(now default tty1). On this site I see that other members have the same problem with it. People, try different boot flash creators or don't use them!\nBut when I try to reboot/shutdown, I still have long time delay. it happens because systemd couldn't normal stop MySQL. Also 'systemctl stop' command not working for MySQL service. So if you KILL this process or uninstall MySQL delay problem will vanished to. So another question will be \"Why systemd couldn't stop MySQL daemon\"\n", "Q: EN-GB hyphenation not working in LibreOffice 5.1.2.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 Hyphenation for EN-GB language text on LibreOffice 5.1.2.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 does not work anymore.

I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS from 14.04 LTS. All worked pretty fine except for an issue on Chinese fonts which I've been unable to resolve.\nWhile the font is mostly OK in system applications, it doesn't work well in Chrome: It seems that Chrome automatically uses Noto Sans font as the fallback font, which for some reason is only installed in its \"thin\" variant in 16.04 LTS and thus looks very ugly. In Firefox and many other applications, the font Wenquanyi Zenhei is correctly used as the fallback font and it looks much better. If I delete Noto Sans from the system, Chrome just gives me blank squares instead of trying to use Wenquanyi Zenhei.\nI'm not sure why that's happening. Is this something specific to Chrome, that Google intends it to use its own Noto Sans font for fallback? Or is it something about system configuration? Or is there some setting in Chrome that I can change? How can I change the fallback font for CJK?(systemwide or just for Chrome)\n\nA: There was a bug in the fontconfig package (I reported the bug, which has since been fixed in fonts-noto-cjk - 1:1.004+repack2-1~ubuntu1) which somehow let Chrome believe that \"thin\" is the correct weight to use. I removed the package and downloaded NotoSansCJK directly from Google, which contains fonts of different weights in separate files. After installing the fonts manually this issue seems to be fixed, and Chrome is able to render CJK correctly even though my default font is still unchanged (Liberation Sans).\n\nA: The “Noto Sans CJK\" font is over 100MB, it is a complete fonts with all weights and all characters in CJK.\nAny way, there is something wrong there. My work-around is:\nIn chromium settings -> customize fonts, change \"standard font\" to use \"Noto Sans CJK\", like me use \"Noto Sans CJK SC\"; I think maybe for Chrome, it is the same.\nYou can refer to this qustion or this bug to see more info.\n", "Q: Problem when setting 802.1x authentication in Ubuntu 16.04 I live in a campus and we need to set certificates and private key in 802.1x tab to connect.

This happens when I try to drag and drop the private key directly, otherwise Ubuntu doesn't show at all any file, using the 'open' button.I attach also a picture with more details.\nAny solution to this?\nBest regards, Ervin\n\nA: We had a similar problem and have found a work-around. We created a new network connection and set the appropriate fields using the nmcli program. This worked properly; we could not find a way to use the network-manager applet successfully. Here is a summary of what we did (proper values must be substituted for values within brackets [])\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the interface name using:\nnmcli d\n\n\n*Create a new connection using:\nnmcli con add type ethernet con-name [connection-name] ifname [interface-name] ip4\n\n\n*Set the 802.1x params using:\nnmcli con mod [connection-name] 802-1x.eap tls 802-1x.client-cert [path to client cert] 802-1x.private-key-password [password] 802-1x.private-key [path to private key] 802-1x.identity [your identity] 802-1x.ca-cert [path to CA cert]\n\n\n*Bring up the connection using:\nnmcli con up [connection-name]\n\nIn our case, we had separate files for the CA certificate (ca.pem), client certificate (client.crt) and private key (client.pem). If you have a .p12 file, I believe you can use openssl to create the client certificate and private key.\nI'm not sure all these steps are necessary, but I did try to use nmcli to modify an existing connection but it did not work for me (I may have made a mistake).\n", "Q: Unable to understand ifup/ifdown proceedings I am trying to setup virtual ip for ucarp.

Now to be able to switch, I go to KDE's keyboard settings and set my two desired layouts: the UK one and the German one (dead acute).\nI am now able to switch between the two of them using the icon in the systray. The weird thing is, I don't actually get what I am selecting: When I set it to English, it actually results in a German layout. When I set it to German, I am typing Japanese katakana (カタカナ).\nIn the past I used fcitx to type Japanese, so maybe there is some configuration messed up. I did a complete reinstall of the OS yesterday (using Kubuntu 16.04 now),  however I kept my home directory with all the configuration files. I did not reinstall fcitx but the problem is still there.

But is not resolving my issue.\nThanks\n\nA: PHP has a setting that limits how much memory a single script can use.  It doesn't matter how much total RAM your system has if you exceed that value.\nIf you're running at the console, the file that affects it is likely /etc/php5/cli/php.ini and has a line that reads:\nmemory_limit = XXXXXXX\n\nTo remove the limit entirely, change it to read:\nmemory_limit = -1\n\nHowever, as others have commented, your script is already trying to use over 4 GB of RAM.  Maybe you should rethink what you're doing or look for bugs in the code that would cause that like some sort of an endless loop.  Most PHP scripts, even CLI scripts, should be using less than 256 MB, for even the hardest tasks.  PHP is not designed for loading in a 2 GB file into memory and working on it in variables, or dumping entire databases into arrays.  Many programmers I've worked with make those kind of mistakes.  Instead put that storage to where it works best - leave it in the DB and work on it line by line, or leave it on the filesystem and do the same.\nAnd if this is a web script and not something you're running at the CLI, you probably don't want to mess with the memory_limit setting, at least not in the neighborhood of 4 GB or more.  That's a bad idea for a web server that serves multiple clients.\n", "Q: Merge Chromium and Chrome cache dirs As the title says, is it possible to point both Chrome and Chromium cache directories to the same directory?

Their releases are not usually based on the same state of the common part of their code base.\nWith that in mind I'm not sure if this is possible.

Strangely enough the domain is correctly resolved. If I try to clone/pull after that it does work without errors.\nI have managed to see an error with nslookup once. It stated it could not resolve the DNS using the Google name server (8.8.8.8) with the error SERVFAIL. But when I ran nslookup again it did started to work again.\nHow can a DNS lookup seemingly fail at random? \nI have noticed this error only on my Digital Ocean servers. When using Azure this error does not happen.\nIn both cased I used Ubuntu 14.04 x64.\n\nA: It's possible that one of the DNS servers in your list of available DNS servers is either responding wrong or not at all, or the primary DNS servers for the domain name you're using are suffering in some way.  As much as we like to think that DNS fails over nicely if something goes wrong, that's rarely the case.  \nAnother possible cause is severe latency doing DNS lookups on your network, even to Google's server.  If it fails the first try, then returns the second try, that's a good indication that your DNS server was too slow getting an answer and couldn't respond until it had cached it.\nSo basically it could be your local DNS servers, your host's DNS servers or you may have a bad entry in your resolv.conf file that points to a DNS server that no longer exists.\n", "Q: 16.04 - How To Purge Intel Default Drivers & Reinstall Intel Graphic Drivers I posted this question as I am encountering display problems after upgrading Ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04.

More information about .desktop files can be found here.\n\nA: You could also use symbolic links. Start by putting all the applications into one directory; then, in each class folder, instead of placing the real applications, create a link to the relevant application file. You now only store the file once, yet can access it from many places.\nIf you upgrade applications frequently, you could take this one step further: instead of linking to the application, link to a \"pointer\" or \"stub\", and then link that to the application. That means you'd have something like:\nClass A\n---AppA (links to A)\n---AppB (links to B)\n---AppC (links to C)\nClass B\n---AppA (links to A)\n---AppD (links to D)\nClass C\n---AppA (links to A)\n---AppC (links to C)\n---AppD (links to D)\nApplication directory\n---A (links to A.version)\n---B (links to B.version)\n---C (links to C.version)\n---D (links to D.version)\nNow, when you upgrade a package, you don't need to re-make the links for each class, as they don't change. Instead, you'd change the links in the Application Directory to point to the new version instead, and that's it.\n", "Q: Super key release for whiskermenu How to set Super key (release) as a shortcut for xfce4-popup-whiskermenu.

The workaround of booting windows first, then restarting works but I don't like things that don't work correctly, sadly I am not techsmart enough to figure this out on my own.\nThanks\nedit  I do have \"secureboot\" and \"fastboot\" turned off, I did both of those when trying to install 14.04 before abandoning it for 16.04\n\nA: Open a terminal after Ubuntu has booted to your desktop.

My concern is appropriate separation between users. \nI don't want them to view each other processes, access each other's files (unless explicitly allowed), etc. It would be nice to not get bitten by every privilege escalation bug or restart the server with every minor kernel update. It would be perfect to maintain the option of running common services (like web and mail hosting) with these security measures in place. \nBack in the day I used grsec but this requires staying on an older kernel and dealing with the hassle of compiling it yourself. Is there a more modern and more Ubuntu way of ensuring user separation on a shared server? \nPerhaps you can do something with AppArmor to that effect? Or maybe there is a repository of kernels pre-configured for shared environments? Or a solution based on containers? These have been en vogue lately.\n\nA: hidepid\nprocfs on Linux now supports the hidepid option. From man 5 proc:\nhidepid=n (since Linux 3.3)\n      This   option   controls  who  can  access  the  information  in\n      /proc/[pid]  directories.   The  argument,  n,  is  one  of  the\n      following values:\n\n      0   Everybody  may  access all /proc/[pid] directories.  This is\n          the traditional behavior, and  the  default  if  this  mount\n          option is not specified.\n\n      1   Users  may  not  access  files and subdirectories inside any\n          /proc/[pid]  directories  but  their  own  (the  /proc/[pid]\n          directories  themselves  remain  visible).   Sensitive files\n          such as /proc/[pid]/cmdline and /proc/[pid]/status  are  now\n          protected  against other users.  This makes it impossible to\n          learn whether any user is running  a  specific  program  (so\n          long  as  the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its\n          behavior).\n\n      2   As for mode 1, but in addition the  /proc/[pid]  directories\n          belonging  to other users become invisible.  This means that\n          /proc/[pid] entries can no longer be used  to  discover  the\n          PIDs  on  the  system.   This  doesn't  hide the fact that a\n          process with a specific PID value exists (it can be  learned\n          by  other  means,  for  example,  by \"kill -0 $PID\"), but it\n          hides a process's UID and  GID,  which  could  otherwise  be\n          learned  by  employing  stat(2)  on a /proc/[pid] directory.\n          This greatly complicates an  attacker's  task  of  gathering\n          information   about  running  processes  (e.g.,  discovering\n          whether some daemon is  running  with  elevated  privileges,\n          whether  another  user  is  running  some sensitive program,\n          whether other users are running any program at all,  and  so\n          on).\n\ngid=gid (since Linux 3.3)\n      Specifies  the  ID  of  a  group whose members are authorized to\n      learn  process  information  otherwise  prohibited  by   hidepid\n      (ie/e/,  users  in this group behave as though /proc was mounted\n      with hidepid=0.  This group should be used instead of approaches\n      such as putting nonroot users into the sudoers(5) file.\n\nSo, mounting /proc with hidepid=2 is enough to hide the details of other users' processes on Linux > 3.3. Ubuntu 12.04 comes with 3.2 by default, but you can install newer kernels. Ubuntu 14.04 and above easily match this requirement.\nACLs\nAs a first step, remove rwx permissions for others from every home directory (and for group as well, if you require it). I'm assuming, of course, that the folder(s) containing the home directories don't have write permissions to anybody except root.\nThen, grant services like the web server and mail server access to the appropriate directories using ACLs. For example, to grant the web server process access to the user home pages, assuming www-data is the user and ~/public_html is where the home page is kept:\nsetfacl u:www-data:X ~user\nsetfacl d:u:www-data:rX ~user/public_html\n\nSimilarly, add ACLs for the mail processes and the mailbox directories.\nACLs are enabled by default on ext4 at least on Ubuntu 14.04 and above. \n/tmp and umask\nAnother problem is /tmp. Set the umask so that files aren't group- or world-readable, so that users' temporary files aren't accessible to other users.\n\nWith these three settings, users shouldn't be able to access other users' files, or examine their processes.\n", "Q: Help manual partitioning for installing ubuntu alongside win 7 I have windows7 installed on c drive .

I bought 10$ wireless USB adapter such as\nhttp://www.tendacn.com/en/product/download/W311MI.html\nand my wifi connection get operational without any additional settings.\nThis adapter comes with a CD for Linux drivers, but it seems that for my HP 4740s they are not required. Probably Ubuntu 16.04 LTS have drivers for this device.\n", "Q: MySQL istallation problem on Ubuntu 16.04 (my.cnf public ip problem) I follow these instructions to install mysql in Ubuntu 14.04 and it works great. But I make a clean installation of Ubuntu 16.04 and make the same steps to install MySQL and I have problems. \nThe my.cnf file is clean. I replace the content for my.cnf file from theubuntu 14.04 installation, restart the service and it doesn't work.\nAt this point I can't allow access to MySQL on a public IP by modifying the bind-address parameter in /etc/my.cnf. \n\nA: The configuration file name and directory changed in Ubuntu 16.04 when compared to Ubuntu 14.04. The new file is located here:\n/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysql.cnf\n\nYou can edit it using: \nsudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysql.cnf\n\n\nA: The configuration file name and directory change in Ubuntu 16.04 \nThe new file and location here:\n/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\nYou can edit this using:\nsudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\nOR\nsudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n\nI find this solution here:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-linux-16-04/ \n\nA: When we try to edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf file we will see something like this:\n\nAs the file is protected so we can edit \nsudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf file.\n", "Q: Do files/directories belong to a user AND a group? I'm trying to understand how file permissions work in Ubuntu. However, I can't understand the difference between user and group permissions.\nIn here it says:\n\nOwner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the\n  owner of the file can perform on the file.\n\nBut it also says:\n\nGroup permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a\n  user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform\n  on the file.\n\nSo does a file belong to a user or a group? If the 2nd column shows the group permissions, how can those permissions be any different from the user ones?\n\nA: as mentioned above there are 3 sections to the permissions for an example which may be easier to understand here is how it is broken down \nsay root is the owner/user of the file\nsay video is the group\nand then as mentioned there is the world/other section which covers anyone that doesn't fit in the first two.\nNow if the file has permissions like\nRead/Write for root\n\nRead for the group video with user1 as a member of that group\n\nand none for world/other\n\nThen the root user would have full read write control over the file. \nAny user in the video group (user1) would have read permissions but would not have access to modify the file.\nAnyone else would not even be able to view the contents of the file. \nas mentioned sudo chmod can be used to change the permissions of a file. Usage of chmod is too large to explain here but a simple breakdown is like this:\nu is for user,\ng is for group,\nand o is for others.\n\nr is for read permission,\nw is for write permission,\nx is for execute permission.\n\nso if you wanted to set a file so that the user/owner of the file can have full access and you wanted the group to have read and be able to execute the file (such as a script) and you wanted everyone else only be able to execute the file the command would be:\nsudo chmod u+rwx, g+rx, o+x /path/filename\n\nto remove a permission you just use a minus instead of the plus... so if you decided that you didn't want \"world/other\" to be able to execute that file you would just use\nsudo chmod o-x /path/filename\n\nYou will also see numbers used at times and I would actually have to look those up but basically I know that 7 is full permissions so if you did:\nsudo chmod 777 /path/filename \n\nit would set the permissions to read write execute for user (first seven) group (second 7) and world/other (third 7).  \nThere is also a recursive code (-R note the capitalization it must be uppercase) .. if you wanted to change all the files in one directory and its sub-directories (be careful with this command because if you type the wrong path you can set permissions for files you may not want to touch) but it would look something like this:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/user/blah  \n\nthis would change the permissions for the folder blah, all the files and all its sub-directories and files to have full read/write/execute for anyone.\nHope this gives you a better understanding of chmod and permissions. If you need more you can just do a search on chmod commands and you should find the information you need\n\nA: Not only are there user and group permissions, there are also \"other\" or \"world\" permissions on files.\nTo answer your first question, yes, a file has user or group permissions. \nTo answer your second question, the second column does show group permissions and those permissions can be changed through the 'chmod' command. \n\nA: The group permissions are setup to make the same set of permissions available to many users. Consider a file xyz which needs permission of rwx for 5 users. There are two ways for accomplishing this.\n1) Set individually permission of rwx for all 5 users for the file xyz.\n2) Make a group ugroup (say). Set it's permission for file xyz as rwx and add all the 5 users to  ugroup .\nAll users belonging to the group ugroup would have the same set of permissions for the file i.e. rwx .\nThis setting up groups properly ensures  reuse of same set of permissions thereby preventing you to repeat yourself.\n\nA: I don't think anyone really answered your specific question. (Maybe the extremely vague comments, not sure. Why do people do that?)\nFiles belong to a user and a group. You can see both of these with the 'ls -l' command.\nYou're question about group permissions being different than user permissions is a good one. You're probably thinking of a file you own that's also in your group. To learn the whole story behind this you need to look into 'User Private Groups' and umask.\nIf you experiment with 'chmod' you'll find out what you can do with files you own and are in your group. When I tried it, if I as user had write permission, I could write. If only my private group had write permission, I couldn't write. I'm new to this so I don't know why it acts that way.\n", "Q: Sleep Mode Problem Unable to Wakeup I have upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04 and when the computer goes into sleep\nmode I can not wake it up.

You know, I was waiting for this release from last 3 months eagerly. I even downloaded it through torrents to help in anyway I can.\nWhen I installed it and I saw that it doesn't recognized my broadband connection. I installed it on another hard disk (I had two). Then I booted to my Windows 7 again and Internet was working. Then I booted to Ubuntu 16.04 again and there is no Internet. When I saw available connections, it showed Network 1 or I don't know what but something was there; but no IP address.\nThe main point to note is, when I was seeing these available connections. I tried to delete that single connection it was showing. It got deleted. When I booted into Windows 7, it also stopped recognizing any connection. Troubleshoot was always showing that \"there is no cable connected\" but it was there! The cable was connected and 100% working on my router! Seems like because I deleted that 'shown connection' in Ubuntu, it did something weird to my hardware. In frustration, I wiped out Windows 7 and reinstalled it; clean. But still not recognition of cable connection. \nNext day in evening when I again started my computer, Internet started working again (Thank God). But now it was showing \"Network 2\" instead of any other name. And it was also connecting and disconnecting automatically. For now because 2 days has passed, it seems stable.\nNow I want to know what actually happened? I really wanted to install Ubuntu 16.04 and wanted to use it as my primary OS.\n\nA: So I read somewhere on this forum or I don't know where that a user having similar problem cold booted his computer and internet worked or did I read somewhere that cold booting removes everthing from ROM or RAM (I don't know)?

ypbind on my server and runs the sudo, no more useless bind(2) and no more TIME_WAIT between my server and NIS server are observed.\nI can't stop the ypbind and I want my old agile sudo speed back so bad B)\nWhat can I do?\nThank you\n\nA: I had the same issue using NIS groups and users.\nEach user authentication is painfully slow.\nYou can as well tcpdump the traffic between the client and the NIS server and see an unusual storm of packets going on between the two for like a minute in my case.\nI went to play with the config and had the idea of switching the config a la redhat and it completely change the behaviour of the auth, login, sudo very fast.\nJust remove the \"+::::\" from /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and the nsswitch.conf file to change the following lines :\npasswd:         files nis\ngroup:          files nis\nshadow:        files nis\n\nTell me how it goes.\n\nA: We ran into the same behaviour after upgrading a couple of systems to 16.04 LTS.  We use compat mode with NIS to selectively choose, via +@netgroup and +user in /etc/passwd, who from the larger NIS domain may access our systems.\nMy co-worker - who should get all the credit, but doesn't do the StackExchange thing - found a workaround that lets you keep compat mode and the ability to use +@netgroup and +user in /etc/passwd.  Leave the compat mode for passwd and shadow, but use \"files nis\" for group in /etc/nsswitch.conf:\npasswd:    compat\nshadow:    compat\ngroup:     files nis\n\n\"compat\" mode for /etc/group is equivalent to \"files nis\" if all you want to do is include the entire NIS group map.\nWould be interested in hearing whether this works for your situation.\n", "Q: Detach JetBrains DataGrip from terminal I recently installed DataGrip from JetBrains, I extracted in /usr/local/share and I added into my ~/.zshrc to execute from the terminal like this\nDATAGRIP_HOME=/usr/local/share/DataGrip/\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:~/.local/bin:$DATAGRIP_HOME:$DATAGRIP_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$ACTIVATOR:$ACTIVATOR/bin:$SCALA:$SCALA/bin:$TMUXIFIER:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\nEvery time I execute datagrip.sh the proccess keep attached into the terminal and I get all the log of the application\nwhich is the way to detach it?\n\nA: Run it with (replace <command> with the command you use to run it):\n<command> & disown\n\n", "Q: ProjectLibre in Ubuntu 16.04 Can anyone help me install Project Libre on Ubuntu 16.04? \nI tried source forge, but I could not find the .deb to install. \n\nA: You can download the deb files (for different versions) from SourceForge here.\nThen use sudo dpkg -i <name-of-deb-file>.deb to install.\nThe latest .deb file is this one.\n\nA: You can install ProjectLibre automatically with these commands (the URL address must be updated to the latest version).

But Ubuntu shows two I have only an HP Deskjet 2540 installed in Ubuntu 16.04. But in scanner, it shows two devices\nFor example, when I start Xsane  it shows two available devices.\nThe device is connected via wifi only. Both scanners are shown only when connected to the same wifi. Only one printer (the first one hp:/net/Deskjet_2540_series?zc=HP9CB654E780ED) is shown in system setting / printers. I can delete only that from system setting / printers. Can't delete the duplicate.  \nHow to delete the duplicate?\n\nA: It is only one device, but accessing via two different methods. I presume this device is connected to your network for printing and scanning, as well as connected to your computer via USB. The second entry in that list is for accessing the device over the network (see the ip=192.168.1.104 bit.\nTo get rid of one of the entries, you can either disconnect it from your PC directly, and scan over network, or disconnect it from the network and only scan over USB. Or leave it as is, and do either.\n", "Q: Why has Avidemux been removed from Ubuntu 16.04's repository? Why has Avidemux been removed from Ubuntu 16.04?\n\nA: I think nobody outside Canonical can answer that authoritatively, and an answer wouldn't be productive anyway.\nIf you want to know how to use recent avidemux versions on xenial, there are several PPAs around.\nThe ppa from Thanh Tung Nguyen seems to be of good quality, but unfortunately, the last release failed to build. There is also a getdeb.net ppa which specializes in obscure software, and it has the latest avidemux 2.6.12. You need to install the avidemux2.6-qt version or the avidemux2.6-cli version. For me, it runs without issues. \n\nA: You can use the binaries from wily, they work under xenial as well (I use it frequently). Just get the .deb files from\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/avidemux/1:2.5.4-0ubuntu16\nand install using \nsudo dpkg -i FILENAME\n\nIf there are error messages you are still missing one of the deb files (read the error message and download the .deb file you need).\nAt the end do a \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nto download the other dependencies automatically (libfaac, etc.)\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the Ubuntu scrollbars and theming in Firefox 46.0? I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 and I've just upgraded the firefox package (released today) from 45.0.2 to 46.0.\nThe release has brought an unwelcome change; the ugly Ubuntu scrollbars, and even uglier Ubuntu menu colours. How can I disable these, and get back the standard Firefox/GTK style?\nBefore: Firefox 45.0.2 on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Menus and textbox popups use black text on light grey background\n\n*Scrollbars are grey, have up/down/left/right icons\n\n\n\nAfter: Firefox 46.0 on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Menus and textbox popups use grey text on Ubuntu off-black background\n\n*Scrollbars are orange flat-design travesties\n\n\n\nI want to keep Firefox 46.0 but get rid of the sucky Ubuntu UI theme. Here are the steps I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked Tools -> Addons -> Appearance to see if it's a distinct theme from the default -- it isn't, this IS the default.\n\n*Tried changing Firefox theme to several complete themes -- several of these changed every aspect of the Firefox UI except the scrollbars and popup menus, others did change them but I just didn't like their aesthetics.\n\n*Checked Tools -> Addons -> Extensions and disabled the \"Ubuntu Modifications\" addon. This didn't help.\n\n*From the old \"how do I disable overlay scrollbars?\" question, I tried apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar, then restarting my session. This didn't help.\n\n*From the same question, I tried gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal and this didn't help either.\n\n*From the same question, I tried launching Firefox with LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 firefox and also GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0 firefox, neither of these worked.\n\n\nWhat has worked so far is downgrading to the previous firefox package\napt-get install firefox=45.0.2+build1-0ubuntu1\napt-mark hold firefox\n\nThis works perfectly, so it does show that the problem is specific to the new 46.0+build5-0ubuntu0.16.04.2 version of the package. I looked at the Ubuntu package changelog which doesn't say much, but the Firefox 46.0 release notes say \"GTK3 integration\"; Firefox 46.0 switched from using GTK2 to using GTK3, as Compholio noted in their answer.\nThis isn't a permanent solution, I don't want to fall behind the latest Firefox release. What can I do to get the vanilla GTK theme in Firefox instead of the Ubuntu theme?\n\nA: This appears to be a bug with the GTK3 theme, probably Firefox is using the wrong theme information for the pop-ups and the scroll bar.\nI partially fixed this for myself by switching the theme for just Firefox:\nGTK_THEME=radiance firefox\nYou can add this \"permanently\" by editing the launcher file:\nsudo gedit /usr/bin/firefox\nand adding the line (after #!/bin/sh):\nexport GTK_THEME=radiance\nIt'd probably be a good idea to file a bug against this, but now that I've finally gotten rid of the awful dark menus I'm less motivated to find the root cause of the problem ;)\n\nA: What you could do is to install and use a complete theme for Firefox that includes its own scrollbars etc. This won't look like the old default, but I bet you can find something similar or even nicer.\nIn the Tools menu, select Add-ons, there go to the Get add-ons tab and scroll down the page. In the lower left corner is a link See all complete themes. This should bring you to Mozilla's Firefox homepage and their complete-theme site. Alternatively, click this link.\nPick one of the available free themes that is compatible with Firefox 46 and pleases your eyes, click on its green + Add to Firefox button and after the download completed, confirm the speech bubble asking for your permission by clicking Install.\nThen you will be asked to restart Firefox which you should do, and the new theme will get enabled.\nTo change the theme again to a different or the default one and to remove no longer wanted themes, open the Tools menu, select Add-ons and navigate to the Appearance tab where you see a list of all installed themes.\nPS: My personal favourites are \"BlackFox V2\" and \"NASA Night Launch\" (Yes, I love dark themes...)\n\nA: Not sure if it will work because I don't have this issue but my firefox is synced with my windows system and that may be why. \nIf you click on the button in the right top corner (where you would click to get to preferences) then click on Customize in there you should see themes .. maybe try selecting a different theme might set it right.\n", "Q: How to get Quick Filter back in Synaptic [Ubuntu 16.04 and later] Ubuntu 16.04, Synaptic Package Manager does not have a search box for quick filter. I can use search button, but it opens dialog every time which is really annoying and not convenient.\n\nI want to have something like this which we used to have in earlier releases.\n\nDid Ubuntu made this change or has it been changed by Synaptic?\nWhat is the way to get quick filter back in Ubuntu 16.04?\n\nA: you can try a couple of things:\nsudo apt-get install apt-xapian-index\nsudo update-apt-xapian-index -vf\n\nIf that doesn't work you can try:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall synaptic\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure synaptic\n\nHopefully that will take care of your issues.\n", "Q: What does drw-r--r-- mean in Ubuntu? So, I tried to search it but what does drw-r--r-- mean in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The first letter \"d\" means directory. All following letters are permissions for different users. \"r\" stands for reading, \"w\" for writing, and \"x\" denotes if file is executable.\nFirst 3 letters behind \"d\" are permissions for owner, other 3 for group, and last 3 for others. The permissions for certain file/directory can be seen in Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) using \nls -l\ncommand. They can be changed using sudo chmod command (chmod has to be used with sudo). \nMore can be read here\nSo in your case this means that what are you looking at is a Directory that the owner (assuming that's you) has the permission to read and write, all other users can only read.\n", "Q: How do I install Flash in Opera? I have problem with Adobe Flash Player. While using Opera, few of pages show me that I don't have flash installed.

Any help?\n\nA: That help page is seriously outdated: “This document was last updated for Opera 11.00” while the current version is 41 and Opera completely switched the rendering engine to Blink (the same as in Chromium/Chrome) in the mean time.\nIf you look at the packages recommended by the opera-stable package, you'll find an entry for pepperflashplugin-nonfree. This package will install the PPAPI Flash Player plug-in included with Google Chrome which will work with Opera too (otherwise they wouldn't suggest it).\nFurthermore, the more recent releases of the adobe-flashplugin include the same PPAPI Flash Player without the detour through Google Chrome. You can install it as in How to install Flash player on Ubuntu?. Use karel’s answer if you're unsure since that's the recommended way to install Flash Player in Ubuntu these days, which happens to recommend the same as Hi-Angel’s answer here.\n\nA: There're multiple conflicting packages, e.g. flashplayer-mozilla, flashplugin-installer, adobe-flashplugin…\nThe specific one you need for Opera browser is adobe-flashplugin, i.e.\nsudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin\n\nUpdate per comments: if you get a has no installation candidate error, run software-properties-gtk, and set all checkboxes on the Ubuntu Software tab.

In previous versions of Ubuntu server, to disable CtrlAltDel (reboot), we would edit the /etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf file and change the script to display a message telling that this function won't work any more.\nWhat would be the new way to disable CtrlAltDel, now?\n\nA: In the systemd world, CtrlAltDel is handled by ctrl-alt-del.target:\nctrl-alt-del.target\n   systemd starts this target whenever Control+Alt+Del is pressed on\n   the console. Usually, this should be aliased (symlinked) to\n   reboot.target.\n\nTo disable this target, do:\nsystemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\nThis does not completely disable CtrlAltDel. Systemd has a feature where pressing that key combination more than 7 times in 2 seconds triggers an immediate reboot. I'm not sure how to disable it, but I find it useful.\nI don't think it can be disabled. From the systemd manpage:\n\nSIGINT\nUpon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start the\n  ctrl-alt-del.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start ctl-alt-del.target. If this signal is received more than 7\n  times per 2s, an immediate reboot is triggered. Note that pressing\n  Ctrl-Alt-Del on the console will trigger this signal. Hence, if a\n  reboot is hanging, pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del more than 7 times in 2s is a\n  relatively safe way to trigger an immediate reboot.\nsystemd user managers treat this signal the same way as SIGTERM.\n\n", "Q: PHP7 does not install on Ubuntu with PPA I have a problem.

Is it not possible to install on a Vagrant default image? Or is there just a current temporary issue with the PPA?\n\nA: The ppa:ondrej/php provides PHP packages only for only for supported releases and usually a current development release after some reasonable time.\nAt the time (May 2016) of writing this, the list includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (precise)\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty)\n\n*Ubuntu 15.10 (wily) (EOL July 2016)\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial)\n\n\nWhen you open the PPA in the browser and click on View package details in the top right corner, it states at the top of the page:\n\nThis PPA currently publishes packages for Xenial, Wily, Trusty and Precise.\n\nNote: At the time of the question was asked, the support for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS was not there and was added only later, hence the package not found error.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch and installing .click packages outside of Ubuntu app store? I have just gotten my hands on an E5 Ubuntu Touch device, however, I don't want to register anywhere (including the Ubuntu app store) until I get the hang of it.\nNow, I'm aware that on Android, the app store packages have an extension .apk, and they can be installed either through the Google Play store with a proper login, or through a USB connection using adb install *.apk.\nI've learned that on Ubuntu, the format defined for Ubuntu Touch is called \"Click,\" using the .click file extension, and it can also be installed either through the Ubuntu app store, or through a USB connection using pkcon install-local --allow-untrusted *.click.\nHowever, I'm also aware that on Android, you can start a download of an .apk file, and then install it by doubleclicking (or its equivalent in tapping) once its downloaded; can Ubuntu Touch do the same? \nIf it can, is there an example online of a very simple .click application, that I could download and install the same way - possibly by allowing some developer options first?\nI've noticed via Touch/Collection - Ubuntu Wiki, say, the xkcd-viewer app - but all it offers for download are .deb files, which apparently don't install on Ubuntu Touch, at least not through the GUI.\n\nA: I am not fully clear of the question.

For years, I have been looking for a proper solution to this problem: I am working in Africa where internet connections are often slow and limited to a few locations. When offering GNU/Linux to people here, the access to the repositories in order to update the computer or to install new software is always a problem.\nThis time, I have an acceptable V-Sat connection at home, but in the office, the connection is limited to the corporate computer (through VPN, etc.). Plugging a Linux box to the local network does not give access to internet.\nI am willing to offer to the employees to install a GNU/Linux distrib on their old private computers (Ubuntu flavors only) and I would like to setup something that offer them the possiblity to update their computer in the office through an indirect \"apt-mirror\" kind solution.\nConcretly, I would need to find the way to update the pkgcache.bin automatically, then they could generate a download script that I would execute at the residence and the day after, they can get the requested packages for installation/update.\nTo do that, I could configure a Raspberry Pi 2 box that would act as a local repository, but I do not want it to download all the available packages (9 Gb that I cannot afford), but only the ones already installed (for update) or those requested (from the script).\nSuggestions/questions/thoughts are very much welcome!\nNB: This is not a duplicate of How can i avoid downloading packages every-time I install my Ubuntu?. Indeed, in my case, I need a solution where the clients will connect to the local repository server in a location with no internet connection for none of them, neither the server (only local LAN). The server (i.e. a Raspbery Pi 2 machine) will then be physically moved to a site where it does have internet access and download the packages requested by the client. Once back to the local LAN, it will allow the client to update or install the requested packages...\nNR 2: However, I believe it is a duplicate of this question: How can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)? and Camicri Cube may be the best solution (apt-offline may also be suitable)...\nSo, yes, it is a duplicate... (I do not know how to mark it as such).\n\nA: I think perhaps you could make use of something like apt-cacher-ng this is a caching apt proxy rather than a mirror as such meaning that it will offer the complete repository not only those packages it has locally but requested packages will only be retrieved once and then cached, the same goes for the package lists etc which are cached so long as they are still current.\nIt does also include configuration options to pre cache certain individual packages or even branches of the package tree using wildcards even before they are requested by clients this might potentially offer the best of both worlds allowing the local resources to be used where possible but still providing fallback to the remote repository if needed.\nThis is the manual for it might be worth a look to see if it could suit your needs or not.\nhttps://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/html/\nEdit: It occurred to me after writing this that even if you were to actually create a custom repository and maintain it yourself the clients would still look to download packages not found in that repository from the main ubuntu repos if they had a copy of a recent package listing for them unless they were disabled completely so it may just simply be easier to use apt-cacher-ng if you are careful to make sure you include everything your clients will need it should work well.\n", "Q: Upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04 now I can't boot Windows 7 or 10 I created a boot able flash drive using this procedure: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nI then used this to upgrade Ubuntu to the current version.\nAfter the upgrade, I can not get the windows boot loader to come up no matter what hard drive I try to boot from and the Ubuntu boot loader only shows Ubuntu where as the previous version would also give Windows as an option.

I have a problem. I want to play Minecraft with my friends on our server. I own the server. We will connect by using hamachi. I downloaded Haguichi but it needs Hamachi.I downloaded the \".deb\" file,I don't know how to open other files like \".rpm\" or \".tgz\". I opened it with Ubuntu Software Center and it said \"Dependency is not satisfiable:lsb core (>=3.0)\". \nHow do I fix it ? Also I looked other satisfiable errors but I'm not sure if it works for me.\n\nA: \nNote that this answer only works for 15.10 and earlier.\n\nWhen installing from a .deb file, dependencies do not get automatically installed as well, as would be the case if Hamachi were a complete package. \nHowever, it is easy to install the dependency yourself in this case. Open a terminal and do  \nsudo apt-get install lsb-core \nThen retry installing from the .deb file.\n\nA: The Hamachi download page states that \"Note: The Linux client can now be installed without LSB package.\", therefore it appears that the dependency on lsb-core has been dropped. Download the .deb file for Hamachi again and install it using sudo dpkg -i.\n\nA: \nNote that this answer only applies for Ubuntu 16.04 and newer!\n\nAs of Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, most of the LSB tools and packages have been removed except for lsb-base and lsb-release.  As such, lsb-core and the rest of the packages from the lsb source package do not exist (the other two do.\nThe removal reason is documented in the package's NEWS entry from Debian, where the removal of LSB compatibility actually happened:\n\nlsb (9.20150826) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  This update drops all lsb-* compatibility packages, and is therefore an\n  abandon of the pursuit of LSB compatibility for Debian.

There is, unfortunately, no way around this issue short of the creators of Hamachi updating their packaging. \n", "Q: 16.04: What driver I install for AMD Radeon R7 M260 ?

See How do I find out which flavour of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?.\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu within Docker from 14.04 to 16.04 using do-release-upgrade I have just set up a Docker container with an ubuntu:latest image. This image is, according to /etc/lsb-release an Ubuntu 14.04. Now I would like to upgrade the system in my container to Ubuntu 16.04. Therefore, I have installed the update-manager-core package. However, when I run do-release-upgrade, I just receive the following output:\nroot@container:~# do-release-upgrade \nChecking for a new Ubuntu release\nNo new release found\n\nWhy doesn't this work at the moment? Will it work at all at some point? What are the most convenient ways in order to upgrade the container from Ubuntu version 14.04 to 16.04? Do I have another possibility than creating a new container with Ubuntu 16.04 and copy all data from the old container to the new container?\n\nA: For the record - it is not Docker best practice to update your image from within the image, it is suggested that you work from a Dockerfile which you will use to spin up a new image from updated sources which you will make live when it passes your tests, and then decommission the old image. Ultimately you would want to have production images that can not be updated from within the image. Docker is however very flexible and you can use it as you like. \nWhile the above may seem ridiculously overdone, there is a reason behind it: A primary purpose of Docker is however to force your team to document repeatable instructions for creation of an image, and forcing them to do things from a Dockerfile ensures that you are never held hostage by the knowledge of the developer that set it up - and that you are using stable, more reputable sources.\n\nA: do-release-upgrade -d is your friend :)\nLTS releases do not offer themselves for update until the first point release, usually around june or july.\nAt least I assume that's the problem. I just upgraded a couple of trusty machines to xenial that way. I don't see why it should be any different under docker, but if it is, please let us know.\n", "Q: bluetoothctl - What is a bluetooth agent? I am using the bluetoothctl utility to set up Bluetooth connections between computers and Raspberry Pis.\nIn bluetoothctl, I can see there is something called an \"agent\", and by looking at most of tutorials, this \"agent\" has to be set \"on\" to create connections. I am trying to understand what is a bluetooth agent.\n1) What is a bluetooth agent ? \n2) What is the \"default-agent\" command in bluetoothctl for ? Can it be the same for all connections ?\n3) What is the impact of not using an agent when setting up a connection ?\n4) By looking at man bluetoothctl, it is said that agents can be set a capability. What is an agent capability ? What values could be put there ?\n5) Do agents only exist with bluetooth ? Are there let's say wifi agents too ?\nI am fairly new to the world of Bluetooth, and the documentation for bluetoothctl is quite limited... Any information would be appreciated.\n\nA: The Bluetooth agent is what manages the Bluetooth 'pairing code'. It can either respond to a 'pairing code' coming in, or can send one out.\nThe default-agent should work for you. You say you're new to Bluetooth, so I suggest you go with the default for now.\nNot using an agent will mean the 2 devices cannot negotiate the 'pairing code'.\nAn example might help, so here's an example of what worked for me on my Raspberry Pi 3 called Shep:\npi@shep:~/bluetooth $ bluetoothctl\n[NEW] Controller B8:27:EB:B0:BC:22 shep [default]\n[NEW] Device 18:9E:FC:94:8C:33 iPhone4\n[bluetooth]# agent on\nAgent registered\n[bluetooth]# default-agent\nDefault agent request successful\n[CHG] Device 18:9E:FC:94:8C:33 Connected: yes\n[CHG] Device 18:9E:FC:94:8C:33 Connected: no\n\nHere I asked the iPhone to pair with Shep, and iPhone sent 680044.\n[CHG] Device 18:9E:FC:94:8C:33 Connected: yes\nRequest confirmation\n[agent] Confirm passkey 680044 (yes/no): yes\n\nOr see the following if you want to set the pass key in advance:\nhttp://www.heatxsink.com/entry/how-to-pair-a-bluetooth-device-from-command-line-on-linux\n\nSetup bluetooth-agent to pass the expected pairing code\n$ bluetooth-agent 0000 &\n\nObviously the '0000' could be any number.\nThese agents and 'pairing codes' are specific to Bluetooth rather than Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: Can't connect to smb share after upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 After upgrade to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04, I can no longer access my networked media tank's smb share. It's an old (2009) Popcorn Hour A-110.\nWhen I connect to server smb://192.168.0.5 in nautilus, I get in an endless loop prompted for login resulting in an authentication failed message. I am certain that username/password are correct, because it works in Windows and I've reset it a dozen times. Note that prior to the upgrade (Ubuntu Gnome 15.10), I would not even be prompted for a username/password, it would just open in the file browser.\nSo I installed smbclient to see what is going on, and that gives me a hint:\nsmbclient //192.168.0.5/share -U nmt\nServer does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes'\nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED\n\nThat seems to suggest that the nmt server might be too old to support some security scheme that is required by the client.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I tried all these suggestions and nothing worked.  What worked for me was the following:\nsudo smbpasswd -a [username]\n\nI do not understand why samba forgot the user, and I find it hard to believe that samba needs to be explicitly told about every single user who needs to access the linux machine from windows, but that's what did the trick, (luckily, I have only one user,) so I am letting everyone know.\n\nA: This question is a duplicate of this one.\nThe answer: you must explicitly set\nclient use spnego = no\n\nin /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nIf you can't find this file, execute command:\nsudo apt-get install smbclient\n\n\nA: I'm running ChaletOS 16.0.4.2.  I did everything I could find online to get access to an external drive shared through an Asuswrt-Merlin router.  NOTHING!  I MEAN NOTHING WORKED!!  Once I installed all of the necessary samba stuff, I still could not access my share. I kept getting the prompt to enter my password. I'd enter it correctly but got no joy.  Once I made Peter de Maeyer's change in \"/etc/samba/smb.conf\" above, the drive opened up like blue skies after a heavy rain. Thanks Peter!!!\nSince I never found all of these steps in one place, I hope this might help someone else. What finally did the trick was a combination of Peter's response and this link.  \nTo summarize, I first created the \"~/.smbcredentials\" file and put the relevant info inside:\n(For the unfamiliar, that little wiggly character in front of the \"/\" means to place the file in your \"/home\" folder)\nusername=msusername\ndomain=ENTER_YOUR_WINDOWS_DOMAIN\npassword=msusername\n(The site doesn't say to add the domain, but I did so just for good measure)\nI saved and closed that file and changed permissions for it by entering this in the terminal:\nchmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials\nNext, I edited the \"/etc/fstab\" file by entering this in the terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\nIn the \"fstab\" file I entered this at the bottom (make sure you use your own information here):\nsmb://COMPUTER_NAME/SHARED_FOLDER /media/NEW_FOLDER_NAME cifs credentials=/home/YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0 \nI saved and closed that file and then opened the \"smb.conf\" file by entering this in a terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf\nOn Line #29 (Under \"Global\") I changed the \"workgroup\" name to match the \"domain\" name above.  Immediately under that I created a new Line (Line #30) and entered:\nclient use spnego = no\nJust in case, after reading this site, I thought it would be a good idea to also make this change on Line #101: \nobey pam restrictions = yes to obey pam restrictions = no\nAfter more than twenty (yes, that's 20) hours and hours of searching and borking my system several times, I finally found joy with these settings.\nGood luck and may the Linux Gods be with you!\n\nA: Tried these answers but still can not connect to my Windows shares. I can connect from my Windows PCs to my Ubuntu share but not the other way around. Using 16.04.\nUpdate/Edit:\nWell, after performing many different things including re-installing Ubuntu and editing the SMB.CONF file I figured out how to fix my issue.\nI wiped my laptop clean and installed Fedora 24 Workstation and noticed the same results--HMMMM I said.\nAnd then I realized that most of the computers I was trying to connect to had usernames, of course, but blank passwords. I tried as SMB.CONF edit that someone had mentioned to allow the use of blank passwords but was not able to get that to work. And, as needed, I would always re-start my smbd and nmbd after changes.\nAnyway, I did have one computer on the network that has a username and password. Guess what--from Fedora I was able to connect! Then I entered passwords on the other computers and presto, was able to finally connect to them from Fedora.\nNow, since the goal is to use Ubuntu I again wiped my laptop clean but this time again did a fresh install of Ubuntu workstation. I made two very minor changes to the SMB.CONF file (made these also on the Fedora install) to set the workgroup name properly and the netbios name properly. Just left everything else default.\nNext, shared a folder on the Ubuntu machine. Simply used the GUI to share the folder out (did not modify the SMB.CONF) and set it to allow guest access. Now, every PC on my network can connect to the share on my Ubuntu machine. If I want to place tighter controls on who can and can't access that share I can make changes in my SMB.CONF.\nBut now, to the best part--now I can connect from my Ubuntu laptop to any of other computers and shares on my network. \nThe solution to my problem, which may or may not help others, is that those devices I could not connect to had accounts without passwords. Once passwords were assigned all worked.\nHope this can help someone!\nThanks,\nRich Huelbig\n", "Q: Terminal - how to display 'shades' unicode characters properly?

And, indeed, the three particular characters you've mentioned are drawn as single solid colors.\nThis is the same as the imaginary result of printing the pattern with the dots being infinitely small (and having an infinite amount of them to achieve the desired density), and applying antialiasing.\nI guess the reason for this approach was that printing multiple of these characters next to each other with your preferred look doesn't look nice on the boundary of such cells at many font sizes.\n", "Q: Application Express on Ubuntu Server refused to connect port 8080 Hi I am new to Ubuntu server and trying to get Oracle 11 xe with application express running on a headless VM Ubuntu server.

Thanks.\n\nA: I have two suggestions, neither of which is guaranteed to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Boot Repair -- This tool can fix many boot problems more-or-less automatically. If you run it, be sure to run it from your working Ubuntu install or from an emergency disk booted in the same way (that is, in EFI mode, if your output is any indication). The down side to this approach is that, on rare occasion, it actually makes matters worse. Such problems are rare, but you should be prepared for the possibility.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager -- This program can sometimes boot Windows when GRUB can't, and is therefore worth trying. You can do this in relative safety by trying the USB flash drive or CD-R image before installing it to your hard disk; however, this will require that you disable Secure Boot, at least temporarily, if it's currently enabled. Also, if Secure Boot is active, rEFInd will require you to register a key when it first boots. In this case, I also recommend you install the Debian-package version, not the PPA, because of a bug in Ubuntu 16.04 that affects the way the PPA handles Secure Boot.\n\n\nYour problem could be caused by an accidental deletion of the Windows boot loader. If that's the case, neither of the above solutions will work, and the only repair options involve using a Windows recovery disk or restoring the EFI System Partition's (ESP's) files from a backup. You can check for the relevant files in Ubuntu by typing:\nsudo ls /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n\nThere should be several files in that directory, including bootmgfw.efi (the main boot loader) and a number of others. If that file is not present, I recommend you investigate this detail further before you attempt either the Boot Repair or the rEFInd fix.\n", "Q: 16.04 ALSA / Radeon R9 380 HDMI Audio I recently upgraded from Ubuntu Studio 15.10 to 16.04, and audio output from my GPU's HDMI port no longer seems to work at all.\nOutput from alsa-info.sh can be found here, which includes aplay -l among other useful things. http://pastebin.ca/3584748\nOutput from the onboard sound card (Card 0) and my USB audio interface (Card 1) seems to work fine.

Playing directly to the onboard audio device, (hw:2,0 at the time) of course, worked.\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that pavucontrol indicates that sound is being sent to the device.\nETA: (4/28) I tried booting into two different live images of two different distros to see if I could get a good alsa-info.sh output, but the audio didn't work on either of them either. One was Ubuntu 15.10, and I installed fglrx; still no sound. I suppose it could be a physical problem with the card, but it would be an amazing coincidence.\nI've seen mentions of the radeon.audio module property around. The radeon module isn't loaded, amdgpu is the relevant module it seems. I haven't been able to set amdgpu.audio, (which is a valid property, and seems to do the same as the radeon equivalent) but that's another problem I am having in a separate question. (Here: /etc/modprobe.d/ conf file ignored)\nETA: (5/01) I had begun to suspect, and another person has confirmed, (/etc/modprobe.d/ conf file ignored) that the amdgpu driver just isn't capable of supporting audio out for my GPU's chipset. If I find otherwise, I'll update the question again, or answer it.\n\nA: I have just installed AMDGPU-PRO driver (current version is 16.30) and the sound now works from my screen using the HDMI cable!\n$ sudo lspci | grep VGA\n\ngives me\n[AMD/ATI] Tonga PRO [Radeon R9 285/380] \n\n", "Q: Remastersys does not work Here's the deal. I want to create a custom Ubuntu distro, but I can't. I downloaded the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and used Remastersys to make an ISO with it, and it doesn't work.\nHere's what happens. I set up all of the correct settings, click on the ISO, and then it starts building. After that, a menu appears. There's only 2 options although I'm aware that there's supposed to be 3. The first one says to open the console application, and the second one says to continue building.\nI wanted to customize it, so I clicked \"Open Console Application\". Then it doesn't open, and I get the following error:\nOption \"-t\" is no longer supported in this version of gnome-terminal.\nError constructing proxy for org.gnome.Terminal:/org/gnome/Terminal/Factory0: Error calling StartServiceByName for org.gnome.Terminal: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ChildExited: Process org.gnome.Terminal exited with status 8\nGtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.\n\nI've searched all over the internet, and couldn't find a solution. Does anybody here know what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: Pinguy Builder is a simple, yet useful application to backup or remix an installed Ubuntu operating system. It is the fork of Remastersys tool which is abandoned years ago. Pinguy Builder allows us either to easily backup the entire Ubuntu system or just create an installable ISO of the running system. Then, you can burn the ISO to any DVD or USB, and install that OS on any system. http://www.ostechnix.com/pinguy-builder-build-custom-ubuntu-os/\n", "Q: Screen times out in i3 WM I love i3 for obvious reasons (light, maxing screen size, ability to customize). However, my screen times out after five minutes of inactivity. I would like to turn this off, how?\nI've got i3 on ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10.\n\nA: X.org has some basic screen saver functionality as well as energy saving features. Most likely either or both are responsible for the described behavior.\nThe settings for both can be viewed and changed with the xset tool (from the x11-xserver-utils package). xset q displays the current settings in the sections Screen Saver and DPMS (Energy Star).\nYou can disable the screen saver feature with:\nxset s off\n\nThe power saving feature can be turned off with\nxset -dpms\n\nWith these settings the screen should no longer turn off or blank automatically until you reboot your machine.\n\nIf your main concern is that 5 minutes are to short, you can also just raise the limits for that. To enable the screen saver only after 15 minutes (900 seconds) idle time, set the timeout accordingly with\nxset s 900\n\nTo turn off the monitor after 20 minutes of idling run\nxset dpms 0 0 1200\n\nThe two 0 values disable standby and suspend respectively, while 1200 sets the timeout for off to 20 minutes. (I usually do not use standby or suspend because there seems to be no difference between the three modes on modern TFT-displays.) Setting these values also enables DPMS, so you do not need to explicitly run xset +dpms.\n\nA: xset did not work for me.\nwhat did work was modifying\n~/.xscreensaver\n\nand changing timeout to something very large like\ntimeout:    9:00:00\n\nand then after saving the file - not sure if it's necessary, but to be sure I do in terminal:\nxscreensaver-command --restart\n\nand then you can always change it back later.\n", "Q: Juju Bootstrap Error I have installed MAAS, juju. When try to setup juju to work on MASS with running juju bootstrap on command line, juju complaining regarding the storage that it need of the nodes. Yet on the nodes list the two nodes i have already commissioned and on ready state.\nBut i notice that both my storage and disk are both zero while CPU and RAM info looks normal to me.\nSo i jump to this note \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-openstack-with-autopilot and it stuck on the same step above when the installer try to run juju bootstrap .. Error message contain lines below ................\nNo storage information. Commissioning this node will gather the storage information. ....................\nCould someone help ..... thanks in advance\n\nA: I found that re-commissioning the nodes resolved this issue for me. (select commission in the UI, and OK, then power cycle the node(s) if necessary to proceed with commissioning)\n", "Q: Unable to view search results in the Activities Overview for locations I have previously disabled but now re-enabled in the settings I just went into Settings > Search > Search Locations, disabled the search results for my home directory and then re-enabled them with the little slider next to the item. However even after re-enabling the location I still do not see any search results for it in the Activities Overview, is this a bug or is it just that I deleted the index cache and it needs to re-index everything so I just need to wait?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18. The Nautilus search also works perfectly fine so if it is just an indexing issue then Nautilus clearly has a separate cache. If Nautilus does not have a separate class then this will probably suggest that it is a bug, but I thought I would ask here before reporting it.\n\nA: Yes, once you disable it in the settings it clears the cache specifically for the Activities Overview search, once you have re-enabled it you will need to wait a while for it to re-index all your files and folders etc.\n", "Q: How to remove coolrom.com malware from ubuntu? I've been dumb and downloaded the malware from coolrom that inputs some sort of \"\"\"search engine\"\"\" in firefox. I'm trying everything to clean that but without success. Someone knows how should I do it?\n\nA: I had the same problem. To get rid of it, click on the three horizontal lines (top right) -> Add-ons -> Extensions. Find Coolrom then remove. Goodluck\n", "Q: Facebook IM service? In an older time, there was pidgin and empathy and several others, but none of them are supported any more. I have recently grown tired of logging in to Facebook just to check if i have any messages when I use my laptop. Any program suggestions or links are appreciated!\n\nA: From https://github.com/dequis/purple-facebook/wiki :\nThe purple-facebook plugin is a replacement for the builtin Facebook XMPP plugin. Facebook is in the process of shutting down their XMPP service, which will inevitably break existing support.\nAs part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2015, jgeboski worked on a plugin for libpurple to support the newer Facebook Messenger protocol. The plugin is implemented for the development version of libpurple, purple3, which has yet to be released. The purple-facebook project simply back-ports the purple3 plugin to purple2, which is the released version of libpurple.\nAs of October 18, 2015, jgeboski's GSoC work was merged into the mainline Pidgin project. It will appear in the next major release of Pidgin.\nInstall instructions:\nAdd the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jgeboski.list:\n\ndeb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/\n  ./\n\nNotes:\nIn this case, replace  with your Ubuntu version: trusty\n\ndeb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/trusty\n  ./\n\nAdd the repository key:\n\n$ wget -O- https://jgeboski.github.io/obs.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\nUpdate the package index:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\nsudo apt-get install \n\n", "Q: sshd in Ubuntu 16.04 - login takes very long I've seen ssh logins take some seconds many times before in the past. I always found that inappropriate. After I reinstalled my workstations with Xubuntu 16.04, this effect became really disruptive. Between two workstations in the same LAN, it takes more than 10 seconds for an ssh login. Afterwards, everything is fast.\nThe machines can find each other via dns in no time via my router. However, I also tried UseDNS no. I also tried GSSAPIAuthentication no as found on the web.

However, in my situation, this volume is already mounted. And mounting should, even if unmounted, should just take about 3 seconds.\n\n\nA: Same problem. \nNotice I can see after the 10 seconds delay a: \"Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out\" in auth.log\nSolution:\nsystemctl restart systemd-logind\n\nFound it here\n\nA: This solved the issue with hanging at \"debug1: pledge: exec\" in my case:\napt install --reinstall systemd\n\n", "Q: juju bootstrap failing I have MAAS 1.9.1 and commissioned a node.

These are just configuration files and won't effect my python right? \n\nA: It seems to be a part of a Cloud9 SDK. It seems very strange for them to install software to root in a hidden folder and even stranger that they're not able to remove it properly afterwards. \nBut if your goal is to remove it, you can do that by running sudo rm -Rf /root/.c9\n", "Q: opening a very long url in tmux terminal I have a problem with opening very long URL in tmux. In my case the URL is longer than a line and tmux break it into multiple lines. However when I use mouse to click on the URL, it only opens the first line of the URL and ignore the rest. \nI am just wondering how I can change my tmux config to support this use case.\n\nA: It actually depends on how exactly your URLs appears on the screen.\nIf you just print out the lines as it naturally happens (e.g. with cat command), the lines get joined and the URLs can actually be clicked.\nHowever, if you use vim or less or another viewer, they try to show the text line by line and it's actually the software to break the lines.\nWith less, the action that helps is: scroll back one screen with b and forward with space.\nWith vim something like :w !cat can help.\nIn other words, you should think of a way to just naturally print the URL so that it would wrap over the screen border.\nNeedless to say, your screen should occupy the full terminal width, i.e. not split vertically.\nTo temporary remove all other panes, there's 'zoom' for panes in tmux: activated by C-b z.\n", "Q: How to uninstall TensorFlow completely? I accidentally installed TensorFlow for Ubuntu/Linux 64-bit, GPU enabled.\nWhen I installed with Linux 64-bit CPU only, I am getting Segmentation fault while importing tensorflow from python console.\n\nA: When running in conda env or any virtual env sudo doesn't work. So you can use:\npython3 -m pip uninstall protobuf    \npython3 -m pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu\n\npython3 -m is safest way to ensure that you are using pip3 and not pip2.\n\nA: Depends on how you install it considering the fact that there are multiple ways to do it here. Most generic way people do it is through pip, check using:\nsudo pip show tensorflow\n\nUninstall using:\nsudo pip uninstall protobuf\nsudo pip uninstall tensorflow\n\nInstall it using:\nsudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to replace 14.04 LTS with 16.04 LTS remotely?

I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and I am using QEMU+KVM+OVMF for a Windows VM. \nIs there a way to mount physical hard drives to the VM only without using a container, as well as keep the data that is still on them?\nThere are examples of this I assume but I only see them in XML format and I use QEMU command line script. Not very familiar with conversions, no idea what format I'd need to put it in.\nhttp://pastebin.com/WRaZuM02\nThe script I use. I supposedly need to use UUID for my hard drives but I never seen that used in CLI before.\n\nA: Simply specify the hard disk as the \"file\" qemu should use, for example /dev/sdb or /dev/disk/by-uuid/some-uuid-here.  Of course, you must make sure nothing else is using that disk other than this vm or bad things (TM) will happen.\n", "Q: How to prevent Ubuntu from doing anything to the Windows installation? My laptop comes with a 128GB SSD, and it have Windows installed. But since it has almost no space, I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on a USB drive (32GB, USB 2.0).\nIt's working really well, but I don't want that anything goes wrong with my Windows drive, so I modified the fstab file and I added 2 lines:\nUUID=3E98352E9834E655  /mnt/hiro  ntfs  noauto,umask=222  0 0\nUUID=24F62FADF62F7E64  /mnt/hiro  ntfs  noauto,umask=222  0 0\n\nIf I read correcly, those 2 commands disable the mount of those 2 devices (both that Windows uses) and also disable the graphical icon to mount then.\nIs this enough to prevent any problem? Or I'm wrong about these 2 commands?\nThank you.\n\nA: Mounting your Windows filesystems read-only seems a little more straight-forward to me than the umask option:\nUUID=3E98352E9834E655  /mnt/hiro1  ntfs  ro,noauto  0 0\nUUID=24F62FADF62F7E64  /mnt/hiro2  ntfs  ro,noauto  0 0\n\nI also made separate mount-points for each filesystem, in case you ever wanted to have them both mounted at the same time\n\nA: After you've installed Ubuntu, it will never do anything to modify those Windows drives unless you explicitly tell it to.\nIn reality, I would never even worry about modifying your fstab file, but keeping the 'noauto' flag won't hurt anything and will, in fact, prevent Ubuntu from trying to mount the drives automatically (just in case, I suppose)\n", "Q: BQ Aquaris M10 will not detect MS Designer keyboard or mouse Brand new M10, done OTA upgrade.

M10 detects the 5 and 7, just not keyboard or mouse.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: As far as I know the Bluetooth facility of the phablet is restricted to connecting just one single device.

I downloaded Ubuntu 16.04 LTS from the official website, saved the iso on a flashdrive, and made it bootable with Universal USB Installer.  I tried to install it on an HP Compaq dc7600 running Windows XP.  It recognized the flash drive and allowed me to begin the install, but I looked over a couple minutes later and the screen was spazzing out.  It had frozen, and a mesh of perpendicular stripes blinked on the screen.  I couldn't get control back, so I did hard reboot.  The HP logo came up, but no OS logo.  Instead it shows me a black screen with an underscore blinking in the upper left corner.  It's unresponsive to keypress and mouse click.  I can still get into the BIOS, but changing the boot order affects nothing.  I reformatted the USB drive and tried again with Ubuntu, then again with Mint, and still nothing.  \nHas anyone encountered this before?  Does it sound like there's a hardware issue or perhaps something went wrong when I created the original bootable USB drive?\nMany thanks.\n\nA: To make sure it's not your laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check md5sum of your ISO's to check their integrity.\n\n*Try a different USB.

I had not previously seen such an option under desktop settings. I think because i still had an older version of the xcfe desktop. After updating it to xfce 4.12 in xubuntu 14.04 and re-installing whisker as per NCODE 3/6/2015 - the desktop settings dialog showed a checkbox to not show the mountable volumes on the desktop.\nI also first updated xubuntu and at this point I think I had an earlier version than 14.04. The conf-editor does show more entries now - specially under the gnome key - but the original question is now irrelevant - seeing that the conf editor is showing more stuff and I am able to remove the unwanted desktop icons without using that approach.\n", "Q: How to use snapshots with BTRFS in Ubuntu along with a separate HOME partition My goal is to make snapshots while upgrading software. I installed Ubuntu primary partitions and Using MBR with Legacy BIOS with a separate HOME partition in another HDD formatted in XFS and root in *\"/\" in BTRFS\nI know there's this package called apt-btrfs-snapshot.\nThis my system layout :\n$lsblk\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 223.6G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0 215.6G  0 part /\n└─sda2   8:2    0     8G  0 part [SWAP]\nsdb      8:16   0 465.8G  0 disk \n└─sdb1   8:17   0 465.8G  0 part /home\n\nNote:\nI have to get back to BTRFS when I reinstall . I've been using Ext4\n\nA: from your screenshot of the disks tool i can see that you are trying to create an lvm physical volume using the extended partition (/dev/sda1), you can't do this because an extended partition is only a container for other partitions, in this case your btrfs (/dev/sda5) and swap partitions (/dev/sda6), but not in an lvm compatible way. This is also the reason why lvmdiskscan cannot see it.\nThe simplest solution would be to , after backing up the data, use the partition with the BTRFS filesystem as your lvm physical volume then create a logical volume within it to restore the data to, assuming it wasn't too full. The command you were trying to run would then be \nsudo pvcreate /dev/sda5\n\nA better choice would be to repartition the SSD (ideally with a GPT instead of MS-DOS partition table, then you can make many many partitions without the limitations of older hardware requiring extended partitions) to not use the extended partition at all.  This is not essential given that you are using LVM which allows you to ignore those limitations because of its abstractions. Don't repartition if you need to preserve an existing OS.\nFYI, btrfs is optimised for lots of small files like a mail server , its not the most efficient filesystem for a home dir. ext4 might be a better choice as its more general performer\n", "Q: Boot new 16.04 in Secure Boot Mode I have a Dell laptop with factory installed Ubuntu 14.04. This OS would boot fine with Secure Boot turned on. \nI have now installed 16.04 alongside 14.04, and I can dual boot.\nI downloaded the 16.04 ISO from the Ubuntu site, but so far as I know it is not signed by Ubuntu. What do I need to do to make the 16.04 boot with Secure Boot turned on?\npgmer6809\n\nA: I just tried, and was able to boot the Ubuntu desktop 16.04 AMD64 image, written to a USB flash drive, with Secure Boot active on an HP EliteDesk computer. Thus, I can say with some certainty that this image is properly signed for Secure Boot. Several possible causes of your problem spring to mind, some of which you could correct but others you could not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Image CPU type -- Check that you're using the correct image file, and in particular, that it's for the correct CPU type, which should be AMD64 for the vast majority of computers. (AFAIK, i386 images never supported Secure Boot \"out of the box.\")\n\n*Image damage -- Use the md5sum utility to verify the integrity of your download. (See here for more on how to do this.)\n\n*Improper image preparation -- Some tools, such as YUMI/Pen Drive Linux, create USB flash drives that can be booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode but not in EFI/UEFI mode. If you used such a tool, your disk might not be bootable in EFI mode. This isn't a Secure Boot issue per se, but you might be mistaking it for one. Try using Rufus, UNetbootin, or dd instead. In fact, even if you used one of these tools, switching to another one might be necessary, since there can be system-to-system quirks and incompatibilities.\n\n*Computer boot manager issues -- You might be unable to access your computer's built-in boot manager, or you might be selecting the wrong option in the boot manager. For instance, many EFIs present two options for removable media, one of which boots in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and the other of which boots in EFI/UEFI mode. If you select the former, the disk might not boot if Secure Boot is active; you must select the option that includes the string \"UEFI.\"\n\n*Non-Secure-Boot regression -- You could be seeing a problem that's unrelated to Secure Boot, such as a new kernel bug. Filing a bug report would be in order in this case, but you'll need to track down the problem with more precision first.\n\n*New Shim or GRUB bug -- Finally, you might have encountered a new bug with the Shim or GRUB package. If you're convinced this is what happened, you should file a bug report. You might be able to work around it temporarily by swapping out the EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi file from the 16.04 image with the same file from the 14.04 image; however, before you do this, you should back up your working /boot/efi/ directory tree from your 14.04 installation, since the installation is likely to replace your working shimx64.efi binary with a non-working one. (bootx64.efi and shimx64.efi are the same file; they're just named differently on the installation image vs. an installation to disk.)\n\n\nIt would also be helpful if you describe in more detail what you're doing and what's not working. You claim that the image is not signed, and I'm working under the assumption that this is because you've tried to boot it and can't get it to boot, but even with that assumption, there are details that could be important, such as any error messages you might be seeing. If there's any evidence that GRUB has launched, then that would tend to support a post-GRUB problem. Thus, describing exactly what's happening is important to better diagnose the problem. (If necessary, take a video, post it to YouTube, and post a link to it here.)\n\nA: Rod's suggestion to use shimx64 instead of grubx64 is the answer. Using the efibootmgr or similar, I set the shim to be the bootloader, and now I have no more issues with secure boot, no matter which OS I install or boot from.\npgmer6809\n", "Q: MAAS virbr0 interface created MAAS server had two interfaces eth0 external net and eth1 internal (for pxe boot). Somehow I am seeing a virbr0 under interfaces and an IP assigned to it. Not sure where that interface and its IP came from. Is it possible it was created after juju install? Or while trying to commission node in MAAS. MAAS and JUJU are on same machine.\nIP for virbr0 is similar for another post on this similar topic.\nvirbr0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr d6:79:21:a9:19:6e\n          inet addr:192.168.122.1  Bcast:192.168.122.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\n\nA: IIRC on Ubuntu virbr0 with 192.168.122.1/24 is automatically created when you install qemu packages. Run:\ndpkg -l | grep -i qemu\n\nto see is that the case.\n\nA: As pointed out in above answer, virbr0 is a by-product of installing qemu which is useful to enable the MAAS controller to control libvirt-hosted \"BNCs\" (ie: KVM-hosted VMs).  In my experience it's safe to get rid of virbr0; this can be achieved as follows:\nvirsh net-destroy default\n\n(run as a user who's a member of the libvirtd group or sudo if necessary).\nA side note: in my experience, the presence of virbr0 and associated subnet/fabric on the MAAS controller did cause some minor issues; for instance, for whatever reason provisioned nodes refer to the MAAS controller's IP on virbr0 in their ntp.conf (even though they don't have any NIC on that subnet); this may be a bug?

When I'm trying to move the window buttons to the right by using dconf-edit How to switch window controls to the left (Gnome Shell)? I'm unable to move the window buttons to the right.\nWhat can I do to move the buttons to the right?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly and you are on (Vanilla) Ubuntu 16.04 with GNOME Shell installed (version 3.18.4) the following command should move the buttons to the right:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':minimize,maximize,close'\n\nTo set them back, the command is:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'close,maximize,minimize:'\n\n\nA: Hmmm... Interesting. I was thinking... I'm on 16.04. I'm also on gnome-shell 3.18. But my window buttons are on the right.\nLightbulb, when reading the comments: Oh, I'm on Ubuntu GNOME, rather than Ubuntu vanilla.\nIf you wanted to use Ubuntu as distro and Gnome Shell as the DE (as I also prefer), you'll have a better Gnome experience by installing the Ubuntu GNOME flavor instead. So why not give it a try? The base distribution will just be the same anyways.\n\nA: At the moment there is not much that can be done to shift the window buttons to the right in a standard installation of Ubuntu Xenial Xerus. Since Trusty Tahr the handling of window decorations is no longer accessible from org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences and is now handled by Unity itself. Alterations with tools such as the Tweak Tool or Dconf Editor in this area are no longer respected and will exasperatingly and silently be ignored.\nSo until someone can produce a suitable patch for the Unity source code, and I would personally welcome such a patch, we are stuck with buttons to the left.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launchpad: Can no longer move windows controls to the right (16.04) - gsettings has no effect now\n\n*Launchpad: Window Controls not functioning.\n", "Q: understanding details of xrandr while exploring different possibilities of my monitor with different resolutions I have been using xrandr.

The explanation is that by default, the screen is \"assumed\" to be at 96dpi, which is not necessarily the case. If the screen is on, the value is set form the \"real\" resolution (pixels/inch), which is obviously slightly different on your screen.\nthis bug is related to the issue; you would probably get the same difference when getting the screen info via xdpyinfo.

This counts as well for lines beginning with #!, they are simply only comments for the shell/terminal when typed in by hand.\nAnother option could be to echo your comment directly into the `.bash_history' like this.\necho \"# i am a comment to be saved\" >> ~/.bash_history\n\nOf course this would be a lot of typing each time, but this would even allow you to make multi-line comments with echo -e, here an example:\necho -e \"# line 1 comment\\n# line 2 comment\" >> ~/.bash_history\n\nAnother option for making multi-line comments would be the following:\ncat >> ~/.bash_history << \"EOF\"\n># line 1 comment\n># line 2 comment\n>EOF\n\nThis way the lines with comments will get added and you end the input with typing EOF, thats as well pretty useful if you have systems where you have no editor at hand.

Please try again.\"\nI also configured the sudoers file and add/edit my user priveleges:\nmaximus ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nbelow the root priveleges. \nIs there any other way to access or any other configurations to access it in GUI?\n\nA: I solved it!.. I change the one that launches the synaptic by replacing \nExec = synaptic-pkexec \nin usr/share/applications/synaptic.desktop\npkexec is the one that manages authentication when you open synaptic(that is the flaw) which it doesn't authenticate you even though your root password is correct. I replace it to \ngksu synaptic %u\n\nthen, save it.(You must have a gconf-editor and gksu installed.)\nAfter that, I press alt+ F2 then I type there \"gconf-editor\" and then I go to apps>gksu and then mark the sudo-mode. \nIf pkexec gives you trouble launching synaptic in GUI, better try to change its launcher to gksu. That will do.\n", "Q: How to check if the MPI already installed on my machine I need to know how to check if MPI is already installed on my machine, and if not how much time it takes to be installed ?\n\nA: Run the command:\nompi_info\n\nIt will give you the description of your mpi library if installed.\n\nA: Googling tells me that the command to install MPI is sudo apt-get install libcr-dev mpich2 mpich2-doc. Enter that command. If it is already installed, it will tell you. If not, it will tell you how much data needs to be downloaded. Then the data needs to be unpacked and the various files copied to their destination. Finally, installation scripts need to run.\nIf you don't like the amount of stuff that needs to be downloaded and/or installed, you get the chance to cancel the installation.\nIn my experience, even large packages rarely take more than a minute to install.\n", "Q: Ubuntu OS Query for old OS I have an old desktop with 2GB of RAM and an Intel Pentium 32-bit CPU.\nWhich version of Ubuntu should I use?\n\nA: I'd recommend Lubuntu 14.04, unless you have a decent graphics card, in which case you could run the regular version.\n", "Q: Nginx installation error in Ubuntu 16.04 \n:~$ sudo apt-get remove nginx* && sudo apt-get install nginx-full*\n\nReading package lists...

In my case was a Western Digital Passport external HDD.

If that's your case check on a terminal with\nupower -i $(upower -e | grep mouse)\n\nor with GUI, gnome-power-statistics or in Gnome Shell Power Settings:\n\n\nA: Another possibility - maybe weird sounding but perhaps easy to try - use a different USB port or if using a USB hub, try directly connecting the mouse to the computer.

I don't know how to make it a redistributable package. \n\nA: To add it to the official xkeyboard-config package, you would develop it as a patch for the xkeyboard-config package.  See their code contribution guide; contributed layouts are made by patches on their bug tracker.  You can clone the upstream repository with:\ngit clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xkeyboard-config\n\n\n\n*\n\n*From a quick glance at your layout, I think you need to add the default keyword to the stanza definition (default xkb_symbols \"basic\"), to declare that layout the default for that file.  Your file itself would be put in the symbols directory.\n\n*In addition to your new layout file, you'll need to add it to the rules templates (rules/base.xml.in or possibly rules/base.extras.xml.in -- the rules/evdev.xml file will be generated from the same template).\n\n*Doublecheck the project documentation for other specifics that I might have missed.\n\nYou could also add that patch to the Ubuntu source package apply it with the standard dpkg build tools.  This would allow you to distribute your modifications to other Ubuntu users with minimal difficulty.  See questions like How to create and maintain patch on Debian package? for more specifics.\n\nA: You can wrap your keyboard layout as a Debian package. This will create a .deb file which can be installed from the command line with sudo apt install -f ./my-file.deb or just by double-clicking the file in the file explorer.\nI've done this and have published the work on GitHub. That repository contains really all you need to do this, but in the interest of having a self-contained answer here, I'll give an outline of the process.\nStep zero, learn how to make a keyboard layout. You basically have to modify some configuration files in /usr/share/X11/xkb.\nThen, learn how to make a Debian package. Our package's job is basically going to be to just modify the right files in the aforementioned xkb directory. However, if you try to do this, you'll find as I did that dpkg yells at you for trying to overwrite another package's files. You will need to get around this using diversions.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 from 14.04 using an iso/live usb? If it is, then will it be a stable install ? If I'm not wrong, Ubuntu supports upgrades between 2 LTS versions. Since I have already downloaded the .iso file at work, I would like to use it instead of upgrading it using the software-updater option.\nIf that is not possible then do I need to wait till June/July for a stable build? Some people are recommending a clean install, instead. I want to weigh in the pros and cons before doing it. \n\nA: Upgrading between 2 LTS releases will be available on .1 point release of the later release. In this case, you'll have to wait until 16.04.1 is released, which, according to release schedule, will come out on July 21st.\nBut upgrading using live ISO is not possible. Upgrading system will need individual packages to be installed. You'll have to download another type of ISO called alternate ISO which installs packages from CD. In the past, Ubuntu used to provide alternate ISO for desktop flavors, but it's not available anymore. For server flavor, alternate ISO has been the only available ISO for downloading. In your case, I think you should upgrade over the internet as ISO you downloaded is useless anyway.\nI personally never upgrade between 2 LTS releases but have upgraded between 2 consecutive releases from 13.04 all the way up to 16.04 today. Of course, some problems do pop up, but with the power of Google, I can fix those problems. If you're upgrading a desktop, don't hesitate to try. If anything goes wrong, you can always reinstall. But if you're upgrading server, you may want to set up test server before proceeding to upgrade.\n\nA: If you're seeking to minimize your data downloaded, you can try setting up an apt package cache with apt-cacher-ng.  It's mostly a transparent install, but you do need to set up apt on the client(s).  I did this:\n echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://hostname:3142\";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy\n\nFrom here, changing hostname of course. You may also need to enable https passthrough if you have some non-standard repositories.  Some fuller instructions are here: https://www.tecmint.com/apt-cache-server-in-ubuntu/\nIf you want to copy the cache between computers that aren't networked to each other, I believe you can copy the contents of /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/.\n", "Q: Virtualbox in Ubuntu 16.04 - Unity grabs Alt and Super key This is something that was answered in the past already for previous versions, there are bug reports but nothing really solves it and it's still present in 16.04\nIf you have Ubuntu 16.04 Unity as host and Windows guest in Virtualbox VM, when you are on the Windows guest using Super or Alt keys makes that both the guest and unity capture the key. Super key will open the Dashboard in Unity host and Start menu in Windows Guests and Alt key will open the HUD in Unity and any of the uses of Alt in Windows.\nThere are several bug reports about this. I.e.:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/741869\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1060225\n...\nand the only workaround is this:\nHow do I prevent Ubuntu from capturing the Alt key to show the HUD?\nWhich is simply to 'disable' the HUD key in CCSM... not a good solution.\nDoes someone knows a good workaround or if this is on going to be fixed? This kind of extremely annoying bug, very located, is something that makes me unable to use Ubuntu for work (Yes... I can't be working with VM and having menus of Unity popping up all time)\nVirtualBox is widely used, I understand that this is a major issue but in internet I can't find a proper fix. Am I missing anything?\nNote 1: I also use Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon and this doesn't happen there.\nNote 2: This happens (that I have tested) with every version since Ubuntu 14.04\nNote 3: Checking similar questions about this and the different bugreports, VMWare and any other application (games, etc) that require to use the  or  keys, have same issue. And there is no intention to fix it in any bugreport.... it's a shame!!\n\nA: You can also use CCSM to assign another key to show the HUD when tapped, not only to disable it. You just need to click on the <Alt> button in the same menu -the red arrow- points to in the example image (below), and then click in \"Grab key combination\" button instead of the \"Enabled Box\" and select another key combination to show the HUD.\ncompizconfig settings manager image example\nTo install CCSM use\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nor you can search for it in \"Ubuntu Software\" in unity.\nThen you can start it from the Dash by searching for CCSM and then click in the \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" button. \nNote: Maybe you will also want to assign another key to \"Show the menu bar when pressed\", because it also uses only <Alt> keystroke to function. The difference between the two is that, to show the HUD, you just need to press the key and then rapidly let go, and to show the menu bar, you need to maintain the key pressed for more than a second. I don't know if the second also affects normal behavior in a Windows VM in Virtualbox.\nNote2: The same goes for <Super> key. The only difference is that the option to change this keystroke is in the \"Launcher panel\" in the same Unity menu in CCSM.\n", "Q: DNS cache on Ubuntu Is it true that Ubuntu doesn't have DNS cache by default and what options I have to enable it ?

The stick works with newer kernels. Kernel 4.4.52 (see kernel.org) has no entry in the sourcefile /drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb-usb-ids.h for the stick, so the stick is not recognised and the driver did not load. Kernel 4.9.13 and higher (see kernel.org) has the entry and the modules (drivers) will be loaded.I know some Linux distros with kernel earlier than 4.9.13 that work.

I am setting up a little development LAMP server and I am editing apache configuration files. I used nano to edit and everything seemed to work with the keyboard. However trying to save and exit the file doesn't seem to be working.\nAll of nano's commands seem to use the format of Ctrl + \"Button\". NOTE: The HOST Control button is Right Ctrl and I am trying to use the Left Ctrl for commands.\nCtrl + X - is the command to exit the file. however pushing Ctrl + X (in combination, that is holding Left Ctrl and pressing the X button) only outputs the letter x to the file as if i was just pressing it by itself.\nMy main issue now is that I can't even exit the file to try it with vi instead (since it doesn't use any Ctrl + \"Button\" for simple editing (:wq will work).\nAny help with this issue would be very much appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: Try F2. It's an alternate key for ^x -- that is Ctrl+x.\n\n\nA: Well Some playing around with different combinations of keys let me use Left Shift + Left Ctrl + X seemed to work just like pressing Left Ctrl. So my solution was add the Shift key to the combination.\n\nA: Double tap esc, it works the same! Found out today from https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/ :\n\nYou can hit Escape twice instead of holding down the Control key, if you have trouble doing that. There are also some commands that require use of the Meta key. On most keyboard layouts, Meta equates to the Alt button.\n\nI haven't been able to find an equivalent for alt, however.\n", "Q: Upload dialogs for Firefox and Chrome now differ; FF's doesn't include network drives As long as I can remember (and I've been running 14.04 LTS since its release!), Firefox and Chrome have both used the same upload/download dialog for, e.g., Gmail, or StackExchange image uploads. Chrome, happily, is still using it (note circled option towards the bottom):\n\nVery recently (not sure when -- this week?) Firefox has started to use a different dialog, which does not offer me access to my network drives (nicely mounted, accessible with Chrome dialog, etc.):\n\nObviously I want Firefox to use the same \"uploader\" that Chrome is (still) using. So my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make sure that it does?\n\n*Or, failing that, how can I convince FF to offer me a network share as a location from its upload/download dialogs?\n\nA: This is a known issue in Firefox versions that use GTK3 (like the recently released v46.0). See this Bugzilla ticket for background information. In short, the support for non-local files in the file chooser has changed with GTK3 and Firefox would now explicitly have to support remote files.\nIf you don’t need this feature very often, then there may be a workaround: you can try to find out the absolute path to your network share as mounted locally via GVFS. This will only work, if your network share was mounted before, e.g., by opening it in the file manager. Type/copy the following command into a terminal and press Enter:\nls -d /run/user/$(id -u)/gvfs/*/\n\nIt should print one line for each mounted network share. Copy the line of the share that you would like to access. Then paste the line into the “Location” text field of the upload dialog and press Enter. The file chooser should now open your network share. (If you can’t see the “Location” line, then click the pencil icon in the upper left corner.)\nOnce the mounted network share locations are known, they can also be added to the ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks file to create a persistent bookmark which the GTK3 file chooser can use – in this format:\nfile://$your_location Your Boomark Name\n\nFor example:\nfile:///run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=share.datastore.example.org.uk,share=share/users/thisuser/ My Shortcut\n\n\nA: Firefox is now GTK3 based, Chrome is still GTK2 based., so that's not that easy. You will have to edit your theme or use a theme that supports this.\nSince GTK3 is very new in firefox some themes can have problems, though I personally like GTK3 better.\nYou could add a bookmark to ./config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks, nano ./config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks and see if that works. I'm not really sure.\n\nA: Make sure the gtk2 and gtk3 themes match so the appearance is consistent across applications.  Downloading new themes to find something that work for your preference is a worthwhile option.\nPersonally, I use KDE instead on gnome, and updating to firefox 46.0 forced me to change my gtk3 theme because the oxygen-gtk theme wasn't working.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 won't output sound to Bluetooth headphones I'm trying to use mt SONY MDR-XB950BT headphones on Ubuntu 16.04 but not having any luck. I've managed to get them connected but it doesn't seem like I can actually listen to music/videos out of them. I tried setting the audio output to the headphones, but sound keeps coming out of the speakers instead. I also installed Pulse Audio Volume Control, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. I briefly managed to get it so that the test sound would play through the headphones, but when I tried to watch an online video, the video wouldn't even play until I changed the sound output device.\nDoes anyone have any advice/experience with this kind of thing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I solved this problem by installing blueman.\nTo install blueman, open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install blueman. Once it's installed, you can run it by typing blueman or you can search for \"bluetooth manager\" in the Applications menu. Once blueman is running, you can lock it to the launcher.\nNow, inside the blueman application, Right-Click on the headphones icon and select 'audio profile' -> 'High Fidelity Playback'.\nThere are other profiles available as well, but this is the one that works for me.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my Phillips BT Headphones on Ubuntu-MATE 16.04.\nHere's how I solved it after the headphones had been discovered/paired etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Started playing some audio\n\n*Blueman: Connected headphones via the 'Audio Sink' option, setting 'Audio Profile' to 'High Fidelity Playback'.  Marked the headphones as 'Trusted' in the 'Device' menu (or by right-click context option).\n\n*Ubuntu 'Sound Preferences': In the 'Hardware' tab turned off 'Built-in Audio' and set the headphones (same ID as appears in Blueman) to HSP/HFP.  In the 'Output' tab selected the headphones (again, same ID as appears in Blueman).\nA bit fiddly, but did the job. Turning the 'Built-in Audio' on again once the headphones were connected had no adverse effect on playback, and audio played as normal after the headphones were disconnected. :)\n\nA: I recently upgraded to ubuntu 16.04 and got the same bug trying to connect my UE Boom 2. Some extensive googling shows that this is an ongoing issue with 16.04 since it was released in April 2016. \nNevertheless, I came across this discussion and managed to solve the issue with suggestions from Emmentaler and Brian Peacock.\nFirstly with my UE Boom 2 connected, I went into \"Sound Settings\" and made sure the output \"mode\" was set to \"Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP)\", NOT \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)\". Making sure it was in the low quality output is the only way I can ensure a successful connection. Then I installed blueman sudo apt-get install blueman and then rebooted. \nFrom here, I clicked on the original bluetooth icon in the menubar, went to \"UE Boom 2\" and made sure the \"connection\" was set to OFF. \nAfter that, I clicked on the new bluetooth icon in the menubar provided by blueman and selected \"devices\". The \"UE Boom 2\" appears in the window when it's discoverable. Now click \"Setup...\" at the top of the window. Given the choice of connection, under \"Connect to:\", I selected \"Audio Sink\". This took a couple of tries, but it worked eventually. \nOnce successfully connected, close the setup window and go back to the sound settings. You should now be able to switch the output mode to \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)\" without losing audio. This is now the process I use to start up my UE Boom 2 each time I need to use it. \nYour mileage may vary, but I hope this works for anyone who needs it. This bug has been driving me crazy all day.\nTLDR: Connect using regular bluetooth, set connection to \"On\", set the output to \"HSP/HSF\" in sound settings (make sure that works), set connection to \"Off\". Then set up the device using blueman, connect it as an \"Audio Sink\". Now back into sound settings and change the output to \"A2DP\". \n\nA: \nGo to Sound Settings and set Mode: to \"High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)\" from \"Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP)\" \nProblem is the sound quality and Bluetooth version support. \n\nA: I am using SONY MDR-XZ770BN and I had no problems with Ubuntu 14.04 using the default bluetooth. After installing 16.04 the High Fidelity Playback A2DP Sink was not working. Problem was solved after installing the Blueman manager and selecting the Audio Sink option. Still experiencing some minor issues as sometimes I have to switch off and on the bluetooth before success but it is doing well overall. Try it and maybe it works also for you :) \nP.S. After looking up for some answers on the web it seems that bluetooth issues are always present in Ubuntu. It would be great if it is finally fixed :D\n\nA: I know it's a late answer, and the answers are great, but just to clarify for people who are a little confused about the answers like I was, here's a step by step guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*install blueman from official repositories:sudo apt-get install blueman\n\n*open the bluetooth manager, from applications menu or the tray icon.\n\n*Select your device, and follow the wizard to connect it (It's really easy, and you can alternatively do this step using your desktop manager's built-in bluetooth settings) \n\n*After you connected your bluetooth device, right click on its name in the blueman and select Audio Profiles > High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) like this :\n\nhope this helps.\n\nA: Here is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Blueman\n\n\nAnd for every time I want to use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to headphones in Blueman (right click and click either headset or hands free)\n\n*Right click device in Blueman --> Audio Profile --> Off\n\n*Disconnect in Blueman (right click and click either headset or hands free)\n\n*Connect again (see 1)\n\n*Right click device in Blueman --> Audio Profile --> High Fidelity Playback - A2DP Sink)\n\n\nThis has been the only way for it to work 100% of the time.\n\nA: I was on ubuntu 15.04. While on it, i was already having the problem with my Sony MDR-ZX550BN. The problem was sometimes, ubuntu refused to play sound through AD2P.\nWhat i ended up usually doing, was un-pairing the device (remove it from the bluetooth devices list), then repairing it. It was working.\nThen i upgraded to Xenial Xerus (16.04). I still had the same problem but more frequently.\nI installed Blueman from the ubuntu store, and the problem disappeared.\nTL;DR: Install Blueman with the device already paired.\n\nA: Also have Sony MDR-XB950BT. \nKubuntu 18.04 LTS.\nOpen System settings > find \"Configure the Audio Volume\" > select \"Advanced\" tab.\nFind \"Built-in Audio\" > press \"Profile:\" combobox and select Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output.\nWorked for me.\n\n", "Q: Git commit and push via batch file on Ubuntu Our team have to always submit code on git after their work.

I would strongly installing the newest version.\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-cgi\nHowever I would recommend installing php-cgi meta package that depends on php7.0-cli for Ubuntu 16.04 to ensure you will always get latest PHP version on upgrades:\nsudo apt-get install php-cgi\n\nA: Yes php5 has completely been removed from 16.04 LTS and uses php7.0 but you can fix that easily by :\nsudo apt-get install php7.0-cgi\n\n\nA: For installing old software in a new Ubuntu Version, the old repositories have to be included.\nJust replacing new by old packages\nBe aware that old packages might replace new packages with this first way, but apt will warn you if this is the case and you still have the option to interrupt the downgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*Open the page https://repogen.simplylinux.ch/ and create a repository-list with your needs.\n\n*Copy the repository-list in the file /etc/apt/sources.list ADDITIONALLY to the existing content. You can mark the old repositories with Ubuntu Version in a comment like ## Trusty 14.04 ##, then save the file.\n\n*in the Terminal (Bash, Sh, ...) run \n\napt update\napt search php5\n\nIf you search something else than php5, just replace it by your own requirement.\n\n*Search the package(s) you want to install and run\napt-get install php5-cgi\nHere you can enter also another package instead if php5-cgi, you shouldn't install what you never need.\nInstalling different PHP versions side by side\nFor php exist different possibilities, the list is not complete, some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't install php5 on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n*https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew\nFor other software than php you've to find different solutions for parallel installation.\n", "Q: Help :- Removing Ubuntu using EasyBCD I am having windows 7 and ubuntu dualboot.Now, I want to remove ubuntu and I came across a method of using software EasyBCD (here is the link to refer it:-How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on?)

Two days ago I wiped my hard drive and installed 16.04 LTS (64 bit). I was using 14.04 LTS prior to this. since doing this I've been attempting to get my networked Brother DCP540CN to work properly. The printer portion works fine using whichever install method that Brother supplies, but I cannot get the scanner to function or even be recognized by xsane. I've been working with this multi function printer and Ubuntu for a few years without problems, so I know that it works fine (in 14.04 LTS 64 bit). I tried removing all of the drivers and installing the 32 bit drivers, but another problem arose with dependencies, so I had to return to the 64 bit drivers. Does anyone have any insight into how I can solve this problem?\n\nA: You can use the ppa from sane stuff ppa:rolfbensch/sane-git for the latest sane-backends, type in terminal \"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rolfbensch/sane-git\", and accept the key by pressing enter, as you should know that you have to have installed sane package to use your scanner in Linux or you can install that after adding the ppa because all scanners in Linux are supported through sane project. So I do not know if you know that if your scanner was working in the previous release then you were already using that scanner with help of sane-backends. You just have to do it again this way. And there is another way, compiling the package from the latest sane-backend source but trust me, the former one is easier.\n\nA: See https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Scanner/Brother/ (German site). Worked for me with a Brother DCP-585CW.\nThey write almost at the bottom of the article (translated):\n\nScanning via network since Ubuntu 16.04 (64bit)\nSince Ubuntu 16.04 the scanner does no longer work in ScanLite and probably all other applications using sane either. The network scanner is not found after launching the application although installing the Brother scanner .deb package seemingly worked. Same applies for the Brother driver install tool.\nAfter installing the scanner driver, this has helped:\nsudo ln -sf /usr/lib64/libbrscandec3.so* /usr/lib \nsudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/sane\nsudo ln -sf /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-brother3.so* /usr/lib/sane \n\nand eventually as well this:\nsudo adduser USERNAME. scanner \n\nAfter that, reboot your computer and network scanning with ScanLite should work again.\nThis is because Brother installs its files in /usr/lib64, but since Ubuntu 16.04, they are expected to be in /usr/lib instead.\n\n", "Q: How to migrate from ubuntu 14 to 16 without affecting dual boot windows in background I have no useful data in the old ubuntu . I don't have a live Windows CD. \n\nA: If you're using grub as your boot loader, you can use the update utility in Ubuntu 14.04 to migrate. That's all pretty straight forward, as Ubuntu 16.04 will reinstall grub 2 anyways.\n\nA: The upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 will not effect your windows boot, the windows boot option will be added to the grub menu, so you can boot into windows by just selecting that.\nUntil Ubuntu 16.04.1 release, you have to do in by typing in terminal do-release-upgrade -d and it will upgrade you to 16.04 (development distro) but the do-release-upgrade without -d switch which is the general upgrade command to upgrade from LTS to LTS, will take effect after 16.04.1 release, may be sometime in July. You can wait for that or you can do it now because after upgrading to 16.04 (developemant version), you can easily upgrade to 16.04.1 by just running in terminal:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How does FDE (Full Disk Encryption) work so quickly? I'm curious about how does Ubuntu's full disk encryption works under the hood. Here's an example:\nConsidering the following string as all the disk's content:\nhello world\n\nAfter applying some kind of encryption method it would look something like this:\n(I've used Caesar cipher with an shift of +1 for this example, e. g. A → B; B→C...)\nifmmp xpsme\n\nAs I understand, when the computer is turned off, the drive's content would be the string above. But when it's turned back on, Ubuntu needs its content to be back again hello world in order to successfully boot.\nWhat I don't really get is that in the real world the disk's content is way much more, and the encryption algorithm way more complex, and I find it difficult for the computer to completely encrypt/decrypt all of it in just a few seconds (it doesn't take longer to boot or to shut down).\nHow is this possible?\n\nA: This will be a bit of a simplification, but I'll try to go through the process of accessing a file on an encrypted filesystem.\nFor example, let's say a the beginning of the encrypted filesystem there's a file table; let's say we want to read /foo.bar. So, the first thing we do is read the beginning of the partition, decrypt it, and look through it for the file we want; let's say it says the file starts at 0x10000000 bytes. So to read, we start reading from the disk at that location and decrypting it; similarly, to write, we can encrypt the new contents, and write them at that new location.\nHopefully this helps clear up any confusion on the process.\n\nA: The processor uses dedicated instruction set. It is possible because of it, AES-NI. It enables fast encryption and decryption or you can say it cuts the overhead. It is fast because it is hardware implementation, as explained here. \nYou can check about performance impacts here and they are worth it for added security. \n\nA: How does AES / Rijndael Encryption in general work?\nThis page has a fun A Stick Figure Guide to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that looks easy to understand, though it looks to be 50+ images, for example these two:\n\nand \n\nIt's far too much to duplicate it all here, but if you have to have an all-in-one image it's this one:\n\n\nOr, there's a more compact explanation at http://www.password-depot.com/know-how/blowfish_and_rijndael.htm\n\nThe Rijndael encryption method is based on replacing, changing and\n  performing xor operations on bytes. The method looks like this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From the 128-bit key, Rijndael generates 10 keys of 128 bits each.\n  \n*These keys are placed into 4x4 arrays.\n  \n*The plain text is also divided into 4x4 arrays (128 bits each).\n  \n*Each of the 128-bit plain-text items is processed in 10 rounds (10 rounds for 128-bit-keys, 12 for 192, 14 for 256).\n  \n*After the 10th round the code is generated.\n  \n*Each single byte is substituted in an S box and replaced by the reciprocal on GF (2 8).\n  \n*Then a bit-wise modulo-2 matrix is applied, followed by an XOR operation with 63.\n  \n*The lines of the matrices are sorted cyclically.\n  \n*The columns of the matrix multiplication are interchanged on GF (2 8).\n  \n*The subkeys of each round are subjected to an XOR operation.\n  \n  \n  The security level of this encryption method increases if Rijndael is\n  performed several times with different subkeys.\n\n\nHow does Ubuntu's Full Disk Encryption work?\nI believe it works by encrypting a partition with LUKS (default settings with AES), and then puts some volumes on it with LVM (like /, swap), and decrypts and mounts them at boot after you enter a passphrase. And there is a regular (not encrypted) boot partition that boots enough to ask for the passphrase.\nthe_simple_computer's Guide to Full Disk Encryption with Ubuntu (Updated June 28, 2015) says that's about how the default installer's encryption works, and mentions that dual-booting wouldn't work (at least not out-of-the-box), the drive must use MBR so \"if your computer has UEFI, the distro will be installed in legacy BIOS mode so you can't use Secure Boot\" and \"also gives you a swap size equal to that of your system RAM (often unnecessary) and you have no choice over what kind of encryption is used.\"\n\nHow fast is encryption?\nIf you run cryptsetup benchmark it will run tests and tell you about how fast the encryption alone takes, watch for the (currently) default aes-xts lines:\n#  Algorithm | Key |  Encryption |  Decryption\n     aes-xts   256b    150.0 MiB/s    145.0 MiB/s\n\nAn average hard drive read speed could be 80-160 MB/s, so you won't be much longer than a regular read, and it's possible that the just-read sectors have already been decrypted while you're still be waiting for the hard drive to read more.\nAn SSD could possibly be faster, maybe 200-550MB/s, so you might notice  it. But, random reads could be slower, and I've read that SSD speeds can slow down after use (maybe when the drive fills up completely and it has to start \"erasing\" sectors?)\nHow can the computer completely encrypt/decrypt all of the drive in just a few seconds (it doesn't take longer to boot or to shut down)?\nIt doesn't have to decrypt everything first. The encryption (LUKS) works on blocks of data, can randomly decrypt any block, and acts like a layer between the drive's encrypted data and what the filesystem sees. \nWhen the filesystem wants to see any block of data, LUKS decrypts that block first and then gives the decrypted data to the filesystem. You first wait for the drive to read the block of data (just like without using encryption), and only have an extra delay for the decryption of that single block (or few blocks) of data - and if the decryption is faster than the drive can read, the decryption could be finished before the drive reads the next block of data.\nSo just like a regular filesystem does not need to read the whole drive to read a file, when encryption is added it doesn't need to read the whole drive either, and it doesn't make things a lot slower.\nThe data on the hard drive is always encrypted, so there's nothing to do at shutdown except forget the key.\n\n\n*\n\n*There's more details on Disk encryption theory on Wikipedia\n\nA: Modern computers can do billions of operations per second, so it doesn't surprise me that encryption and decryption are fast.\nThis is how I would intuitively rank how fast computers are at doing things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing calculations within memory (especially L1 and L2 memory), extremely fast\n\n*Reading from local storage, less fast (solid state disks are faster than hard disks)\n\n*Reading from the network, even less fast.\n\n\nThe other key bit to understand is that the operating does not need to decrypt the entire hard disk to boot the system. Rather, the operating system knows how to decrypt only the parts of the hard disk that it needs on the fly, and the same goes for writing.\nSo intuitively, I am not surprised that full disk encryption does not have much of an impact on performance, since I imagine the bottle-neck to be the disk.\nOf course, these intuitions don't always match reality. For instance, in reality, there have been cases where full-disk encryption has caused a noticeable performance hit. But usually these are solved after the developers go through a few rounds of developing optimisations.\n", "Q: do-release-upgrade -d does not offer up 16.04 on a fully updated Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system This command has worked just fine on a couple of Lubuntu systems.

However, others in the bug comments confirm that it solved the problem for them. \n\nA: This seems to be a bug in the graphics driver, so it should be reported once we know what triggers it (hardware, driver).\nThat said, there have been lots of similar bugs and people came up with workarounds there which you can also try for this one.\nIn case you have an Intel graphics card, here are some workarounds to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserve memory for the graphics adapter. In the Intel graphics driver (i915), pixmap caching issues like yours are often connected to the fact that the graphic card's shared memory is dynamically allocated from system memory, so also takes part in swapping, read-back from disk etc. where things can go wrong. So one workaround is to use the mem boot parameter to leave enough RAM unallocated by Linux that is then used exclusively by the graphics card. See the detailed instructions. But note that on x86 systems (32 and 64 bit), the mem parameter is actually a maximum address [source], so has to be set higher (determined by experiment) than the amount of RAM to leave for Linux.\n\n*Disable swap. Again for Intel graphics, not including the shared graphics memory in swapping can be a workaround. Especially promising if the problem mostly does not appear after a fresh reboot, only after prolonged and memory-intensive work. So if you have enough RAM, you can just disable swapping completely by adding swapoff -a to /etc/rc.local [source].\n\n*Try UXA acceleration. It's an option for the X config file, details here.\n\n*Try framebuffer BLIT mode. Again for Intel graphics, you can try sudo echo COGL_ATLAS_DEFAULT_BLIT_MODE=framebuffer >> /etc/environment and then reboot. [source]\n\n*Try to reset Compiz to default settings. Reported here (but quite some time ago) to have helped with similar issues.

Removing the trailing ampersand in the alias definition makes the alias open the specified file as expected, but now obviously doesn't send gedit to the background. What's wrong?\n\nA: My answer is heavily based on this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2011495\nAn alias does not work like that, arguments are always passed to the end of the command. Using your alias as an example, gedit filename will actually run the following:\ngedit $@ > /dev/null 2>&1 & filename\n\ninstead of \ngedit filename > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\nWhich is causing bash to think you inputting a second command called filename.\nWhat you need to do instead, is create a function in your ~/.bashrc file, which will run the gedit command:\nThe following snippet is a slightly modified version of drmrgd's code\nfunction gedit-bg() {\n    if [ ! -n \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo \"USAGE: gedit-bg <filename>\";\n    else\n        ( gedit \"$1\" > /dev/null 2>&1 & );\n    fi\n}\n\nYou will need to re-log for the change to take effect, once you do, you can use the method like so:\ngedit-bg filename\n\n\nA: The warnings from gedit on the server that I use for student accounts are very distracting to the students. Modifying Dan's answer a bit allows student to still type gedit as usual.  I put this in /etc/profile.d/custom.sh (in Centos 7, but presumably it will work in Ubuntu also, or in a user's .profile file)\nfunction gedit-bg() {\n    if [ ! -n \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo \"USAGE: gedit <filename>\";\n    else\n        ( \\gedit \"$1\" > /dev/null 2>&1 & );\n    fi\n}\n\nalias gedit=\"gedit-bg\"\n\n\nA: In fish :\nalias gedit=\"gedit-bg\"\n\nfunction gedit-bg\n    bash -c \"gedit $argv 2> /dev/null &\"\nend\n\nOnly thing that works for me\n", "Q: Gnu date input formats I am trying to get my head around the date input formats used in\ndate -d \"something\"\n\nSpecifically I am trying to understand the use of the \"Day of week items\". The manual page for date refers you to the following set of GNU pages for information on this topic: gnu.org - date input formats.\nThis covers the entire topic of date input formats for GNU. Specifically it says the following about \"Day of week\":\n\n28.6 Day of week items\nThe explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date (only\n  if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.\nDays of the week may be spelled out in full: ‘Sunday’, ‘Monday’,\n  ‘Tuesday’, ‘Wednesday’, ‘Thursday’, ‘Friday’ or ‘Saturday’. Days may\n  be abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a\n  period. The special abbreviations ‘Tues’ for ‘Tuesday’, ‘Wednes’ for\n  ‘Wednesday’ and ‘Thur’ or ‘Thurs’ for ‘Thursday’ are also allowed.\nA number may precede a day of the week item to move forward\n  supplementary weeks. It is best used in expression like ‘third\n  monday’. In this context, ‘last day’ or ‘next day’ is also acceptable;\n  they move one week before or after the day that day by itself would\n  represent.\nA comma following a day of the week item is ignored.\n\nBased on this information I would expect the following command to tell me the date of the third Thursday in 2016.\njonathan@Aristotle:~$ date -d \"4/1 3 thursday\" +\"%y %m %d\"\n16 04 01\n\nAs you can see the day of week specification is accepted but ignored and the result is April 1, not the third Thursday. The documentation states that the \"day of week\" specification should add to the base date specification if necessary. Unfortunately, the rules behind if necessary are not given. Does anyone know how to make this work using the date command. I can obviously work around this problem with Bash scripting.\n\nA: Just for reference, the day-of-week style is baked into dateutils:\n$ dateconv 2016-04-03-04 -f %F\n2016-04-21\n\nwhich is the third Thursday of April 2016 as requested.\nAlternatively, the input can be explicitly specified:\n$ dateconv -i \"%m/1 %c %A\" \"4/1 3 thursday\"\n2017-04-03-04\n\n(I'm not sure what the /1 is in your example).\nDisclaimer: I am the author of the package.\n\nA: I discovered a method that does not rely on the arcane syntax of the input to:\ndate -d\n\nThis function solves the problem:\nfunction calculateTargetDay {\n# Calculates the day in the month of the nth. weekday in month\n# $1 is the current date stored in an array as yy mm dd integers\n# $2 is the day of the week as an integer, Monday = 1\n# $3 is the week of the month as an integer - first week = 1\n# Returns the day of month in the $daymonth variable which should be defined in the main-line\n\ndaymonth=$(( $(date -d \"${1[0]}-${1[1]}-1\" +%u) - 1 )) # Get relative day in week of 1st. of month\n# Calculate release day within month\ndaymonth=$(( $daymonth - $2 + 7 + (( $3 - 1) * 7 ) ))}  # Gives day in month of nth weekday in month\n\nThis encapsulates the calculation in a compact manner.\n", "Q: Apache configuration I am new to Ubuntu , I am configuring Apache to read  root document  from my home directory sites directory\nI edited the (default) file under /etc/apache2/available-sites \nto read from /home/username\nWhen I restart Apache it reads from my home directory to be it's default page \nWhat I am trying to accessing Apache localhost by making users \nsuch as http://localhost/~user1/\nHow I can do this ? \n\nA: This functionality is available by enabling the Apache userdir module with:\nsudo a2enmod userdir\n\nYour next step is to configure how you want Apache to handle the URIs.\nSome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want the URL http://localhost/~user1/site1 to load from the /home/user1/site1 directory, you need to use\nUserDir ./\n\n\n*If you want the URL http://localhost/~user1/site1 to load from the /home/user1/sites/site1 directory, you need to use\nUserDir sites\n\nTo add the configuration, and assuming you are using Apache 2.2, create the following file  /etc/apache2/conf.d/userdir.conf and add the following to it:\n# This is just a safety measure to make sure the root user isn't used.\nUserDir disabled root\n\n# Swap the following line with whatever configuration you require.\nUserDir sites\n\n# If you chose \"UserDir ./\" instead of \"UserDir sites\",\n# remove the \"sites/\" part in the next line\n<Directory /home/*/sites/>\n    Order allow, deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nOnce you're done, you will need to restart Apache:\nsudo apache2ctl restart\n\n\nA: You can define virtualhost with different servername and document root for each people.

In part:  \n   --proxy-dnssec\n          A  resolver  on a client machine can do DNSSEC validation in two\n          ways: it can perform the cryptograhic operations on the reply it\n          receives, or it can rely on the upstream recursive nameserver to\n          do the validation and set a bit in the  reply  if  it  succeeds.\n          Dnsmasq  is  not  a  DNSSEC  validator, so it cannot perform the\n          validation role of the recursive nameserver,  but  it  can  pass\n          through   the   validation   results   from   its  own  upstream\n          nameservers. This option enables this behaviour. You should only\n          do this if you trust all the configured upstream nameservers and\n          the network between you and them.  If you use the  first  DNSSEC\n          mode,  validating  resolvers  in  clients,  this  option  is not\n          required. Dnsmasq always returns  all  the  data  needed  for  a\n          client to do validation itself.\n\nSo it looks like your upstream resolvers aren't passing the validation result.  \nOn my system (YMMV):  \nw3@aardvark:~(0)$ dig @127.0.1.1 dnssec-failed.org\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.8-Ubuntu <<>> @127.0.1.1 dnssec-failed.org\n; (1 server found)\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 55446\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;dnssec-failed.org.

I have set it up properly as per the web configuration pages on the router but I have no idea how to access it from my xubuntu 15.10 laptop (which is connected to the wifi that is supposedly sharing the USB Stick).  I have scoured  all the Huawei pages/forums/manual that I could find and I have found no instruction on how to do this.\nI have also searched more generally and found either how to consume this from windows or how to consume a windows share from linux neither of which I am trying to do.\nI have found various vaguely similar questions, here and elsewhere but they all access a samba share that has a share name on a server with a server name.  If my router has a servername or the usb a share name they are well hidden - I have looked in every setting or menu item on the router.\nWhen logged in as admin to the router apart from the usual LTE and WLAN setup pages it has a 'More' Menu.  This menu has an item for sharing, clicking on that brings you to the sharing page. from here there are three navigation options Samba, User settings and DLNA.\nUnder Samba there is a single checkbox to enable Samba sharing and this information:\n\"Your router supports the Samba server. This allows your computer to access the USB storage device or USB printer connected to the router using the Samba server.

So if I have caps lock on they work, otherwise they don't.\nI've tried changing the shortcuts via the Settings Manager and I tried using dconf editor to reset the defaults but that didn't work. I also saw some recommendations to delete the .gconf directory, however I don't see anything in that directory that's relevant. I installed 16.04 in a VM on another machine and didn't see this issue so it's likely an artifact from the upgrade, but I'm not sure how to fix this.\n\nA: I had a similar problem upgrading from 15.04 to 16.04 I worked around it by using compiz settings manager to add commands with identical bindings. \nie. \n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal -> ctrl + alt + t \nI found that it was generally isolated to shortcuts that were launching programs in my case.\nOn 15.04 - I was able to resolve it by removing the package appmenu-qt5\napt remove appmenu-qt5\n\nPreviously this didn't help for 16.04 but now its working fine\nI realise this isn't a perfect solution but I hope it is helpful\n\nA: Knowing it was a configuration problem I decided to just start deleting configuration files. I'm not sure exactly which one it was that fixed it (I probably should have deleted one at a time to figure that out...), but I deleted:  \n~/.cache\n~/.compiz\n~/.config\n~/.gconf\n~/.gnome*\n~/.kde  \nand keyboard shortcuts work again after a reboot without needing caps lock on...\n\nA: another workaround: use the international keyboards with dead keys. \nThat works for me, although the dead keys are quite annoying.\nOr better, use the international keyboard with altGr dead keys.\nI tried creating a new user on my machine, or removing the given ~/.xxx dirs, but that did not help.\n\nA: I had this problem. The Nav keyboard shortcuts just stop working.\nI narrowed it down to Home/.config/dconf/user\nThis is a binary settings file.\nI just renamed it user to _user\nYou will lose some settings, like any custom app luncher shortcuts but the keyboard shortcuts should work again.\nHope this save some else some time.\n\nwarning - advanced\nFYI: You can edit this binary file with dconf-editor from the dconf-tools package, which is the equivalent to gconf-editor.\nTo install it, do this command\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n\nA: Open CompizConfig Settings Manager, find \"Commands\" plugin, uncheck it, wait couple seconds and check it back.

Remove all imagemagick packages that  are installed. In my case it was imagemagick-6-common.\n\nA: Install it again with apt before attempting to purge.\nIn a terminal, run these commands in the following order:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install imagemagick\nsudo apt purge imagemagick-*\n\n\nA: Quite simple really. Always as soon as u install your Linux\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install aptitude -y;\necho \"\" >> .bashrc;\necho \"# use aptitude instead of apt ALWAYS\" >> .bashrc;\necho \"alias apt=aptitude\" >> .bashrc;\n\naptitude is simply put a better apt.

Is that possible without backup and restoring the data?\n\nA: Install the Terminal app from the store (or if you have enabled developer mode, you can use the phablet-shell tool over USB connection). If using Terminal app on the phone, you may need to disable screen locking Battery Settings first, as if the screen locks, the Terminal app (and its child processes) will be stopped. You can then change the setting back after switching channels.\nThen, on the phone, run sudo system-image-cli -vvvv --switch $newchannel where $newchannel is the new channel you switch to switch to. For different devices, this channel may be different. For example, on the BQ Aquaris E4.5 and E5 Ubuntu Edition phones, the channel should be ubuntu-touch/rc-proposed/bq-aquaris.en to get rc-proposed. You can use system-image-cli -i to show current information, and generally just replace the stable portion of the existing channel name with rc-proposed to get the right channel.

The line that controls it begins Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot and take a true or false value.  If you don't allow automatic reboots, you should be notified that a reboot is required when you login.\nThere are other packages besides unattended-upgrades that can trigger a reboot.  They should all invoke apt to do the upgrade.  Check /var/log/apt/history.log to see if updates are occurring before the reboot.\nIf the reboots are occurring at roughly the same time, then there may be something in the crontabs that is causing the reboots.\nIf the system really is crashing, it may be the BIOS which is rebooting the system.

I know there is a bug in the Software Center, but the problem is not limited to that specific problem.\nI can't install Steam (always says missing dependencies, which I also can't install), Skype (again dependencies), VLC, Dropbox (breaks some packages) etc. \nSince the problem with Skype and Steam is relevant to i386, and I could install them when I was using 14.04, I fresh installed 14.04. This time I couldn't install Skype nor Steam. So I'm back to 16.04 and can't find a way to fix those missing dependencies.\nI used apt-get -f install, aptitude -f install, manually downloading and installing those packages, and even their dependent packages, but every time there is a missing dependency.  Now I don't have my basic apps. Any idea what's causing this? \nI tried to install Steam again yesterday, because Ubuntu software and some other things updated, and when it tried to install its dependencies again it didn't work. And when I do sudo apt-get -f install it gives this:\n\nPaket listeleri okunuyor... Bitti\n  Bağımlılık ağacı oluşturuluyor\n  Durum bilgisi okunuyor... Bitti\n  Bağımlılıklar düzeltiliyor...

I checked if I enabled multiarch or not, it seems like I've enabled it.\nEDIT: Now I tried to let Steam update itself first, and then install those dependencies. This time it downloaded them and with some errors installed them. But they all are broken of course. So nothing changed.\nFINAL EDIT: After a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04, and installing proper upgrades before any app, my problem solved. I can again install i386 libraries.\n\nA: So you did apt-get update? Please check that you have sources in /etc/apt/sources.list\n###### Ubuntu Main Repos\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted universe multiverse \n\n###### Ubuntu Update Repos\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse \ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial-updates main restricted universe multiverse \n\nIf it's so sad:\n\nevery time there is a missing dependency and now I don't have my basic apps\n\nI think you should remove unmet dependencies. When you try to install a new thing there will be unmet dependencies - remove them, and try install those package.\nPS:\napt-get autoremove -y \n\nA: You have to remove .save files \ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ ls\n\nand remove all \nwith this \n/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo rm opera-stable.list.save\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo rm steam.list.save\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo rm ubuntu-wine-ubuntu-ppa-xenial.list.save\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ sudo rm spotify.list.save\n\nRastgele.\n\nA: I'm currently using Xubuntu but since they both rely on same repositories, the solution will probably be the same.\nFirstly, the reason for this problem is the out-dated configuration of the Ubuntu Turkish repo servers. After trying a handful of solutions, I've edited the repo sources and finally I can install Steam in peace. Maybe this is the exact reason why there isn't any fuss about this issue since the US Servers are up-to-date.\nWarning: Before proceeding to the solution, I've noticed that you've mentioned something about \"losing basic apps\" and this may indicate that you've removed some of the core libraries while trying to solve dependency issues. I highly suggest that you do a clean reinstall of the Ubuntu.\nNow, to the solution:\n1) Edit the sources list as\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n2) Delete the \"tr.\" from all urls\nFor example change this:\ndeb http://tr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\n\nInto this:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\n\n3) Save the list with \nCtrl + O\n\n4) Do a fully update/upgrade routine\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n5) Finally, install Steam by using the repositories\nsudo apt-get install steam\n\nThats it! Well, at least for me!\n", "Q: Firefox 46.0 screen is black Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nYesterday (4/27/16) Ubuntu installed several updates.  Afterwards, when I started Firefox (46.0) the screen flashed white then went black.  It was not maximized.  I reduced the Ff page to about half my screen, then restarted.  It came up on the home page.  If I either maximize or increase the page size, the screen goes black. I have to reduce the page size and restart to get it back.\nI'm not using any extensions.\nWhat is the solution to this problem?\n\nA: Here's how I fixed the black screen issue.  With a reduced page size (so that the screen wouldn't black out) I went to the Mozilla website.  The site automatically determined that I was using the latest version but offered the option (with a big green button) to \"Refresh\" the browser.  When I refreshed, the browser worked properly, and continues to work properly.\nI still don't know what happened, nor why the refresh fixed the issue. It may be related to the bug mentioned by @Ignacio. \n\nA: This is probably related to this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/1576382\n", "Q: Shortcut to \"mate-screenshot -a\" not working in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 Just installed MATE on my laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 and I tried to get to mate-screenshot the same behaviour as gnome-screenshot does in Unity: just press Shift+Print to choose the portion of the screen that you want to capture. The corresponding command to be executed under MATE should be \"mate-screenshot -a\", executing it manually works, but trying to set it as custom shortcut doesn't work, it does nothing.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There is still an opened issue for that.\ntl;dr: this is a timing problem with focus.\nworkaround: \nbash -c \"sleep 0.1 && mate-screenshot -a\"\n\n\nA: I reproduced your issue and with help from @Serg and @Seth I figured out how to fix it.\nIn the shortcut you have set DISPLAY to match your environment. First check the variable:\necho $DISPLAY\n\nand take note of the output. For me it's :0.0\nOriginally I suggested using this command in the shortcut setting:\nbash -c \"DISPLAY=:0.0 mate-screenshot -a\"\n\nReplacing :0.0 to match the output you got when you checked the variable\nBut @DavidFoerster pointed out in a comment that the more efficient and proper way is to use\nenv DISPLAY=:0.0 mate-screenshot -a\n\nWhich might make it a touch faster.\n\nA: Workaround if using Compiz and you can give up Windows captures.\nGo into Compiz Mate Compatibility settings and change the Window screenshot command line to mate-screenshot -a. It will then work if you are already using compiz (not Marco). The shortcut key combo is ALT + Printscreen.\n\n", "Q: How to install snap packages behind web proxy I know how to configure APT to use a web proxy. But what about snap?\n\nA: Snap uses snapd daemon. You only need to define http_proxy and https_proxy in /etc/environment and restart the service: systemctl restart snapd.\n\nA: snapd reads /etc/environment, so setting the usual proxy environment variables there works. On Ubuntu, that's done automatically for you by Settings → Network → Network proxy, so as long as you restart snapd after changing that file you should be set.\n\nA: Snap service is configured to use special environment file, so you can just add http_proxy variable to it if your current environment variables are not picked up by the snap. \nOpen file:\nsudo vim /etc/sysconfig/snapd\n\nAdd:\nhttp_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128\nhttps_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128\n\n\nA: There is another way to add environment variables to systemd services:\nCreate a folder for the snap daemon and create configuration files for the environment variables:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/\n$ echo -e '[Service]\\nEnvironment=\"http_proxy=http://1.2.3.4:3128/\"' \\\n      | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/http-proxy.conf\n$ echo -e '[Service]\\nEnvironment=\"https_proxy=http://1.2.3.4:3128/\"' \\\n      | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/https-proxy.conf\n$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n$ sudo systemctl restart snapd\n\nAfter that you can check if the environment variables are set for snapd:\n$ systemctl show snapd | grep proxy\n  Environment=http_proxy=http://1.2.3.4:3128/ https_proxy=http://1.2.3.4:3128/\n  DropInPaths=/etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/http-proxy.conf /etc/systemd/system/snapd.service.d/https-proxy.conf\n\n\nA: A system option was added in snap 2.28 to specify the proxy server.\n$ sudo snap set system proxy.http=\"http://<proxy_addr>:<proxy_port>\"\n$ sudo snap set system proxy.https=\"http://<proxy_addr>:<proxy_port>\"\n\nDocumentation\n\nA: There is a reported bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1579652\nPlease subscribe to check changes on it.\n\nA: Be careful, because the snapd reads the /etc/environment file instead of get the ENV variable.\nThis example below doesn't work:\nexport https_proxy=http://<your.ip.here>:3128\n\nyou have to use:\nhttp://<your.ip.here>:3128\n\n", "Q: Problem flashing Ubuntu Touch Firmware on Aquaris M10 (frieza) I have the new bq Aquaris M10 tablet.  The device was recognized by my Linux machine using adb devices.  I tried making my filesystem writable using phablet-config writable-image.\nWell, this turned out not to be the answer to the problem I was working on.  So, I tried to revert back to the stock firmware using:\n ubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris-pd.en\n\nThe flash failed when the device rebooted to Recovery Mode, but the the host machine flashing the image said device not in recovery mode-- or something else similar.\nCurrrently, the device gets hung on the splash screen on boot up.  adb devices does not recognize the device while it is stalled or while in Recovery Mode.  I can enter Fastboot Mode, but I cannot do much of anything because, for example, trying to list or erase partitions results in a FAILED (remote: unknown command) error.\nI tried loading the device drives in a Windows machine.  When I plug in the tablet, I get the little sound for a recognized device.  But, when I try to use the MTK Flash Tool to flash the frieza firmware, it does not communicate with the tablet.  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nA: You can use ubuntu-device-flash with the device in fastboot mode if you pass the --bootstrap flag to ubuntu-device-flash. You will need to use that method if it won't work in recovery.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and with irc (thanks dobey) and some google food I found this -\nfirst download the recovery image from here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices\nThen run the command again with the added arg --recovery-image=. The img file is only to allow flashing btw, and doesn't contain the whole OS.\nAs others said, you also need to boot the device into recovery mode, and then select the option to boot into the bootloader. Then, be sure to append --bootstrap.\nSo for me, the full command is:\nubuntu-device-flash touch --channel=ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris-pd.en --recovery-image=~/Downloads/recovery-frieza.img --bootstrap \n\nA: You need to flash a new recovery.img before.Look here you can found it:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices \n", "Q: Cannot Mount Harddisk from Macbook to recover files I've looked around and cannot find a solution to this problem.\nI am working on an old Macbook that died and am trying to salvage some files form the disk.

I am running Ubuntu in a virtual machine and I'd like to add CPU and RAM without rebooting the device. How can I hotplug this new virtual hardware?\n\nA: Instead of operating the kernel parameters, you can automatically enable hotplugged CPU or memory by using udev rules:\n/etc/udev/rules.d/94-hotplug-cpu-mem.rules:\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"cpu\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", ATTR{online}=\"1\"\n\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"memory\", ATTR{state}==\"offline\", ATTR{state}=\"online\"\n\nTested on CentOS 6/7, Ubuntu 14.\nDebian 7 crashed for unknown reason.

However, windows like the \"Files are missing\" from Ktorrent (or selecting a file from chromium), will close but leaving its track. This \"track\" will appear when changing from virtual desktop to virtual desktop, but dissapearing after about half a second (probably what the transition occurs), while staying forever in the virtual desktop where it was originally closed.\nExample Images:\nAn example image is shown in the following image\n\nAn example taken just at the moment of a transition is as follows\n\nNotes\nThe images are cumulative, clicking on them has no effect (i.e. like clicking below the image, if the image is over a folder, it will normally open such a folder).\n\nA: I had the same issue.

It already had one, so in total, now three. Last night on adding the third account. The details were all taken OK and then it froze, so I closed it down and tried to start it up again.\nNow when I try to open Dekko email, it brings up the menu dropdown list on the left hand side of the screen and then closes. It happens like this all the time. Reboot and even praying to the gods does not help.

All your account data will be cleared. Add the accounts again (perhaps creating a new backup after adding the second account would be wise). If the problem persists, try varying different things like the order in which you add the accounts so that you would know what makes Dekko crash: the number of accounts or the particular account. It wouldn't help you, but it might be useful for the developers when they will fix this bug. You might be able to contact them by IRC (#dekko on Freenode), but I believe that it should be done after submitting a bug to their bugtracker.\n\nA: Seems like the problem comes when \"Email settings/Offline settings/Start offline\" is set to \"ON\".\n\nA: Here's a \"bump\" for a bq Aquaris M10 FHD running Ubuntu 15.04(r3) from UBPorts.\nIt looks to me like it's still a problem with loading offline.\nDon't delete your configuration\nAt the bottom of ~/.config/dekko.dekkoproject/dekko.dekkoproject.conf\nthere's a [global] section and when I set \nimap.enable=true\nimap.offline=false\ndekko started again.\nDon't forget to make a copy of the original before you edit it\n", "Q: How do I get a stable IPv6 address in 16.04? I have a domain name that points toward my home server. Under every Ubuntu release up through Wily, by default I had a stable EIU-64 address that I could use for my AAAA record. However, after installing Xenial, I don't seem to get a stable address by default.\njoejoe@myserver:~$ ip address\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1\n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: enp2s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:24:1d:d2:e3:f4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.0.101/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global enp2s0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 2601:280:3068:2945:74ed:b303:6474:6e29/64 scope global temporary dynamic\n       valid_lft 6965sec preferred_lft 3363sec\n    inet6 2601:280:3068:2945:ac34:ea15:4340:29a4/64 scope global temporary deprecated dynamic\n       valid_lft 6965sec preferred_lft 0sec\n    inet6 2601:280:3068:2945:bdfd:6253:b07e:1308/64 scope global mngtmpaddr noprefixroute dynamic\n       valid_lft 6965sec preferred_lft 6965sec\n    inet6 fe80::dc3e:6127:bd4e:18b/64 scope link\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nAs you can see, all of the inet6 addresses with scope global have limited lifetimes. Is there a way to get my EIU-64 address back, or is there some other way to get a stable address that I can use in a domain name record?\n\nA: I just figured this out. For each connection in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/, you need to set the following property:\n[ipv6]\naddr-gen-mode=eui64\n\nNetworkManager in 16.04 appears to set a default of stable-privacy for the addr-gen-mode setting.\n\nA: The other answers here are a bit incomplete: changing NetworkManager configs doesn't help if you don't have one (which is actually the problem, see below), and disabling IPv6 privacy extensions is actually somewhat unrelated (again if your supposedly-stable IPv6 address changes on each boot, removing the extra privacy addresses doesn't help).\nAs detailed in this thread, a default, new install of 16.04 has a slight oversight if you are using a wired connection. NetworkManager automatically generates an \"ephemeral\" configuration, which works great but is, well, ephemeral. This means that the GUID used to hash into a supposedly-consistent IPv6 address isn't stored, and so you get a new one each boot. Just going into NetworkManager, pressing \"edit\" on the wired connection, and saving it with no changes will generate an actual NM config, with a saved GUID, and so you'll get the same IPv6 address each boot.\nThis address is an RFC7217 address (a crypto hash of the GUID, your prefix, etc etc) -- so although it's stable each boot, it isn't the sort that includes your MAC address into the address directly. If you want one of those EUI64 addresses, this other answer on this question details how to change that.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 and previous releases have always defaulted to the EIU-64 for me, so for servers I have to disable it.  I'm happy to use the privacy address on my desktop.\nSo you need something like:\n    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr=0\n    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr=0\n    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr=0\n    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.<devname>.use_tempaddr=0\n\nThen ifdown/ifup.  The result for me, note the MAC/IPv6 relationship:\n$ ifconfig enp3s0 | egrep 'HWaddr|Global'\nenp3s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 74:d0:2b:90:8b:90  \n          inet6 addr: 2501:300:d008:61c8:76d0:2bff:fe90:8b90/64 Scope:Global\n\nYou can name specific interfaces if you need it enabled on some interfaces not others.  You can see the list with:\n$ sysctl -a | grep tempaddr\n\nI don't recommend Network manager for production services.  For instance it doesn't it does't play well others, like /etc/sysctl.conf for instance.  If you want to do that you willl need an entry in /etc/networking/interfaces for a static address or an automatically configured one.  I'm just using:\nauto enp3s0 \niface enp3s0 inet dhcp\niface enp3s0 inet6 auto\npre-up modprobe ipv6\n\nAdjust to taste of course.\n", "Q: Does this answer work for UEFI computers? One of my most popular answers is instructions on how to repair grub. Over time, others have contributed bug fixes to the answer. A recent comment, though, made me wonder if it works on newer UEFI hardware.\nGabor wrote:\n\nI get a \"cannot find EFI directory\" at step 7 and cannot boot. Any ideas?\n\nAll my hardware is older, pre-UEFI hardware. So my question is this: Are my instructions, particularly step 7, applicable to UEFI hardware? If not, what changes need to be made?\n\nA: In your original answer, you wrote:\n\nWhen you install Windows, Windows assumes it is the only operating system (OS) on the machine, or at least it does not account for Linux. So it replaces GRUB with its own boot loader.\n\nThis isn't true under EFI. Well, Windows is still pretty rude, and could be said to assume it's the only OS, but it does not replace GRUB. Under EFI, multiple boot loader coexist on the EFI System Partition (ESP), and Windows does not delete or replace GRUB.\nThat said, the average user might not notice any difference in symptoms between a BIOS-mode and an EFI-mode installation of Windows after Ubuntu, because what Windows does in EFI mode is to set its own boot loader as the default. Thus, the computer ends up booting Windows instead of Ubuntu. This looks like the same problem as under BIOS, but it's not.\nSomething similar to your solution may work under EFI, but it's overkill, and therefore has the potential to create more problems than it solves. In outline, the simplest way to get GRUB back after installing Windows under EFI is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows.\n\n*Download and install EasyUEFI.\n\n*Using EasyUEFI, move the ubuntu entry to the top of the boot order list.\n\n*Reboot. Ubuntu should boot, but there will be no Windows option.\n\n*In Ubuntu, type sudo update-grub in a Terminal window.\n\n\nAt this point, Windows should show up as an option in the GRUB menu on the next reboot.\nAn alternative would use the built-in Windows program bcdedit instead of EasyUEFI, but EasyUEFI is, well, easier, despite being a third-party program that must be downloaded and installed.\n\nA: If you have EFI, then there will be an EFI System Partition (ESP) on the disk. This partition has to be mounted on /boot/efi, so that GRUB can use it. The partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*is formatted FAT32,\n\n*is usually small (100MB < size < 500MB)\n\n*will have the boot flag enabled\n\n*contains an EFI folder\n\n*could be labelled EFI by the OEM, but no guarantees\n\n\nI don't have one on hand, but you can see examples of how such a partition will look:\n\n\n*\n\n*Super User post about creating one, with parted -l output:\n\n\n*Unix & Linux post, also about creating one, with a GParted screenshot:\n\nSo, the task here is, somewhere around steps 3 & 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the ESP\n\n*Mount it:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi\n\nThen you can proceed with your usual answer. I have done it myself. Consider it similar to mounting a /boot partition if you have one separate.\nYou can mount it anywhere you like. In that case, just specify the mount directory to GRUB while installing:\ngrub-install --efi-directory=/foo/bar /dev/sdX\n\n", "Q: pdo_mysql removed on updating to 16.04 I recently updated to 16.04 LTS.

The solution above from Ignasi is good, and very much appreciated, thank you. However in addition people who have this problem might want to do the following too:\nsudo apt-get remove modemmanager\n\nThis is to remove the influence of the modem manager from interfering with the tty link (unlikely to be a problem in practice, but does seem to happen on occasion in my class of 25 students)\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout rishi\n\nThis is to give you sufficient permissions to write to /dev/ttyACM0 (since your username is rishi)\n\nA: For people that found this, and still had problems after changing the +111 to /111, you might want to check if any other script within the directory is error-ing out. \nFor me, relocate_sdk.py was prefixed with #!/usr/bin/env python instead of #!/usr/bin/env python2, causing a syntax error.\nFixed that and everything is working now.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't see my external usb audio interface I have the Audient iD14 audio interface, and I was able to get it to work with Ubuntu 14. However, when I did a fresh new install of Ubuntu 16.04, it wouldn't even list it in the sound devices. The only way to play sound is to plug my headphones directly into the desktop computer and use the internal audio (which is inconvenient because the computer isn't close, and I would like to have the higher quality sound from the audio interface.)

It isn't pretty and takes a bit of work and may be different depending on what version of Ubuntu you are using. I came up with this using 16.04. I also just tested this to boot into a different kernel because I don't have Windows installed on this box. \nSince you have a dual boot I have to assume that you already have a grub menu showing and hopefully a Windows entry in the main menu not in a sub menu as I will get into later.\nFirst you need to edit your /etc/default/grub file\nLook for the entry GRUB_DEFAULT=\"#\" it probably is 0. Change it to read GRUB_DEFAULT=\"saved\" add a line under it that says GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=\"true\" \nIt should look like the following: \nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"saved\"\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=\"true\"\n...and so on...\n\nSave the file and in a terminal run sudo update-grub \nNow comes the part I'm guessing at. When you boot the computer and its at the GRUB menu ... On my VM box that I used to test this shows the following entries\nUbuntu\nAdvanced options for Ubuntu\nMemory test (memtest86+)\nMemory test (memtest86+,serial console)\nTest1\n\nI had to create the Test1 entry for this to work but I have a feeling that you have a Windows entry somewhere on this list but I don't know where it falls. You need to count where that menu item falls in the list. For example if your Windows entry is where my Test1 entry is then it would be in position 4 (Ubuntu is in position 0 not 1)\nNow that we have that we need to create a file .. I will use startwin in this example\nopen startwin in your favorite editor and enter the following:\n#!/bin/bash\ngrub-reboot 4 \nreboot now\n\n(of course 4 being whatever number you determined that your Windows entry is positioned) save the file and open terminal. Change to the directory where startwin is located and make sure its set to be executable. \nsudo chmod +x startwin\n\nNow you are ready to try it out.. open terminal change to the directory the file is located and type sudo ./startwin of course save all your work and close anything open because this will restart the computer. It should start in Windows and when you tell Windows to reboot it should go back to Ubuntu again. \nIf it worked all you have to do is set up a cron job to have it run at midnight. \nEdit /etc/crontab add the entry at the bottom \n00 00 * * * root path/to/startwin/startwin\n\nand make a Windows task to reboot when you want it to switch back to Ubuntu like 7am. \nNow at 7am your Windows Task would automatically reboot into Ubuntu and at midnight your Ubuntu script would automatically reboot into Windows.\n", "Q: Unable to install npm on ubuntu 14.04 due to broken packages error Tried installing npm on ubuntu 14.04 however the following error has occurred \ngwt@gwt-Aspire-E1-571:~$ sudo apt-get install npm\n\nReading package lists...

Investingating in this direction---\n\nA: The problem got solved with the normal updates, so it is not clear where the problem exactly was.\n\nA: Check the content of /etc/network/interfaces.  Though I could be mistaken, it sounds to me as though you are managing your networks from the GUI.  I have previously had problems with conflicts between my  /etc/network/interfaces file and the Ubuntu GUI setup.\nIf /etc/network/interfaces has networks set up in it, try removing them and using just the GUI setup.  If this does not work, and that file just has the following lines in it, try the steps below.\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nIf your /etc/network/interfaces file has just the those lines, my first try would be to delete everything in your Ubuntu GUI networking and put into /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nOr to configure a static IP (for cases in which you don't have a dhcp router):\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 192.168.1.14\n  gateway 192.168.1.1\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  network 192.168.1.0\n  broadcast 192.168.1.255\n\nAnd replace eth0 with eth1 or wlan0  etc for a secondary ethernet or a wireless card.\nThen run sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart to test it, then reboot to see if it worked.\nP.S.:  I make no guarantees of this working.  It's hard to tell from the limited quantity of information that you're able to post where the problem lies.

How to tell Ubuntu to stop naggin me for \"unmet dependency\"? So I force installed Vuze (and its dependency Azureus) via apt-get, and it is working fine on default-jre.\nEven though the default-jre works as a dependency for Azureus (at least for my use-case scenario), the dependency check inside Azureus package demands an older and dated version of JRE, and I am being bombarded with unmet dependency message.\nEach time I perform some apt-get operation, I get greeted with these:\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n azureus : Depends: openjdk-7-jre but it is not installable or\n                    openjdk-6-jre but it is not installable or\n                    sun-java5-jre but it is not installable or\n                    sun-java6-jre but it is not installable\nE: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\nEdit: I do not want to \"resolve\" the dependency issue, because there is no dependency issue to resolve. The warning is erroneous because the dependency check inside Azureus is outdated.\nIs there any way to tell Ubuntu to ignore the dependencies for this specific package?\n\nA: You can't tell Ubuntu to ignore the problem, but you can fake the installation of a package by building a dummy version. It's not that painful.\nsudo apt install equivs\nnano openjdk-7-jre\n\nPaste in something like the following:\nSection: misc\nPriority: optional\n\nPackage: openjdk-7-jre\nDescription: Dummy package\n\nAnd then run:\nequivs-build openjdk-7-jre\nsudo dpkg -i openjdk-7-jre_1.0_all.deb\n\n\nA: I have found another \"arguably more appropriate\" answer. This will give you the ability to edit out the wrong dependency inside the culprit package. Unlike the dummy package method, this will not affect the entire system.\nYou need atool (sudo apt install dpkg-dev devscripts atool) and gdebi (dpkg will do too, but I prefer gdebi)\n$pkg = the name of the package that is causing issue.\napt-get download $pkg\nmkdir pkg\natool -X pkg $pkg\nvi pkg/DEBIAN/control\n# [This is where you edit out the wrong dependencies]\nrm -vf $pkg && dpkg-deb -b pkg $pkg\nsudo gdebi $pkg\n\nIn my case, the line that I had to edit was :\nDepends: openjdk-7-jre | openjdk-6-jre | sun-java5-jre | sun-java6-jre, libcommons-cli-java, liblog4j1.2-java, libswt-gtk-3-java, java-wrappers\n\nThank goes to sergall for this solution.

I went into the official website of Linux and it recommends me to use Ubuntu. And I have some questions about Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Ubuntu free of charge?\n\n*Now I am using Windows, do I need to have a disk partition?\n\n*Can I choose rather use Windows or Linux?\n\n*Can I run Windows applications on Linux?\n\n*if I want to delete either Linux or Windows, can I restore the two disk partitions back to one?\n\n\nA: \nFirst of all, is Ubuntu free of charge?\n\nYes\n\nSecond, now I am using Windows, do I need to have a disk partition?\n\nIn general yes. \nEach installed operating system needs at least its own partition.\nKeep in mind: for testing Ubuntu or any other operating system it might make sense to check out a Virtual Machine like Virtualbox, VMware or similar. Great for testing/learning as it reduces the risks for beginners to wreck the core-setup.\n\nThird, can I choose rather use Windows or Linux?\n\nIn case of having several operating systems (which is often called dual Booting) installed you usually have some kind of boot-manager (i.e. grub), which lets you choose which operating system to boot at startup of the computer.\n\nFourth, can I run Windows applications on Linux?\n\nIn general no, why there are some special cases like using wine to emulate a windows environment. this works for some applications but is no general solution for random window-apps\n\nLast, if I want to delete either Linux or Windows, can I restore the two disk partitions back to one?\n\nPossible in general yes - depends on what tools you have in access. Modern windows versions can enlarge partitions with inbuild diskmanagement tools, older versions can't.\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu Operating system is free\n\n*You will need to partition your hard drive in order to use Ubuntu and Windows on the same computer. \nPlease see this video for instructions.\n\n*You can. If you're referring to the same computer, a grub loader will be installed allowing you to choose which operating system you want at start up.\n\n*You cannot run Windows applications directly on Ubuntu. However you can install Wine which will allow you to run many Windows applications. \nPlease read here for more.\n\n*Yes, by deleting the Ubuntu partition from Windows will completely remove Ubuntu from your computer. But why would anyone do that? :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu is completely free of charge.\n\n*If you want to keep Windows\nand run Ubuntu, you will need at least one spare partition (or a new separate disk), and will need to install what is called a\nDual-Boot system. On the installer you would need to choose the\noption to 'Install Ubuntu alongside Windows'. This is not always\ntotally straightforward, especially on a UEFI boot based system.\n\n*If you have installed Dual-Boot, you will choose which system to use\nwhen the computer starts.\n\n*Windows applications don't run on Linux. It is possible to use some\nthrough a few pieces of software, such as Wine or PlayOn Linux, but there are normally bugs, or reduced functionality. Some applications just won't work at all.\n\n*There are ways to restore your partitions if you remove one of your\nOperating Systems, but you'll need to be comfortable with\npartitioning.\n\n\nI'd advise making a USB installer for Ubuntu, and selectin the 'Try Ubuntu' option before taking the plunge. Alternatively you could create a Virtual Machine of Ubuntu running on your windows installation through software such as VirtualBox.\nP.S. you should only really ask one question at a time on Ask Ubuntu!\n\nA: \nSecond, now I am using Windows, do I need to have a disk partition?\n\nYes. The Ubuntu installer supports creating partitions, but using it to shrink your Windows partition might be dangerous. I would recommend you use the Windows Disk Management Utility that's part of Windows (see here). You can then use the installer to create your new partition.\n\nThird, can I choose rather use Windows or Linux?\n\nYes. The installer will (normally) install the Grub Boot loader, which will allow you to choose between Windows and Linux.\n\nLast, if I want to delete either Linux or Windows, can I restore the two disk partitions back to one?\n\nYou can, but you first have to delete the Linux partition(s) and then use the Windows Disk Management Utility to resize the Windows partition. If you want to get rid of Windows, you can use GParted from your Linux installation.\nRemoving, moving and expanding partitions is dangerous however. You should always make a back-up of all your files, and keep your installation discs ready should anything go wrong.\n", "Q: Can't access Windows Partition anymore - No permissions I've installed Ubuntu 15.10 alongsite Windows 10.

This suggests that your Compatibility Support Module (CSM) is active, which can wreak havoc with booting EFI-mode OSes, as described on this page of mine. Thus, I strongly recommend that you disable the CSM. This will require entering your firmware setup utility and finding an option to do this. It may be called \"CSM\" (or its expansion), \"legacy mode boot,\" or something else; unfortunately, there's no standardization on how this option is named or where it may be located in your firmware setup utility.\nDisabling the CSM may not be the end of your problems, though; it could be that your NVRAM settings are corrupted or some other issue may be getting in the way. If you continue to have problems, boot a Linux live disk again, type sudo efibootmgr -v, and edit your question to include the output, adding four spaces to the start of each line. (If the system complains that efibootmgr is not installed, install it. In Ubuntu, you'd do this by typing sudo apt-get install efibootmgr.) There may be redundant entries that you could delete with efibootmgr, or resetting all the firmware options to the defaults may be required -- but the second of these actions will require re-creating an NVRAM boot entry.\n\nA: First make sure if your Windows installation is either Legacy Bios or UEFI.\nIf it's UEFI, then boot your Ubuntu installation media DVD/USB in UEFI as well.\nContinue with installation.\nOnce the installation completes, log into newly installed Ubuntu, then\nsudo os-prober\nsudo update-grub\nreboot\n\n", "Q: How can I view man pages for apps installed via snaps?

Is there any problem with the snap package management?\n\nA: A 'band-aid' solution is to run the following from the command line:\nexport MANPATH=\":/snap/tmux/current/share/man\"\n\nand then the command man tmux will work as well as all of your pre-exisiting man pages. Bear in mind that Ubuntu does not normally use $MANPATH and the standard man pages PATH can be seen as follows:\nandrew@athens:~$ man -w\n/usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man\n\nAfter running the 'band-aid' solution suggested above you should see:\nandrew@athens:~$ man -w\n/usr/local/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/snap/tmux/current/share/man\n\nThis setting can also be placed in ~/.bashrc for permanency, remembering that after placing it there either log out and then back in or simply run: source ~/.bashrc\nNot very satisfactory I must say, especially if each package has a man page in a different location.

Why doesn't the same behavior occur with other startup scripts (e.g. \"service mysql start\")? And is there a way to avoid it?\n\nA: Since nobody wrote an answer (despite bounty), I'm going to explain myself, how I finally solved this.\nmuru's comment (thanks a lot!) was right and brought me on the right track: In Ubuntu 14.04, the Apache startup is managed by a sysv init script, and being a shell script it inherits everything (environment variables, open file descriptors, etc.), and the apache process started by it will inherit all of those as well. Mysql, in turn, is managed by Upstart, which ensures a clean environment for started services. This explains the different behavior for Mysql and Apache.\nArmed with that knowledge I knew better, what to look for, and found this answer on unix.stackexchange.com. It suggests to close the file descriptor in the sub-shell that calls scripts that shouldn't inherit it, while keeping the descriptor open in the outer shell, to make sure that the lock stays effective.\nUnfortunately, this means that I had to move the flock calls to within the shell script, otherwise my script wouldn't know which file descriptor to close. So my new shell script (which also took some inspiration from this blog post about flock) has the following structure:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFLOCK_FILE=\"/var/lock/backup-lock\"\nFLOCK_FD=20\n\n# Locking\neval \"exec $FLOCK_FD>'$FLOCK_FILE'\"\nif ! flock -n $FLOCK_FD\nthen\n  echo \"FAILED! There is a backup script already running.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n(\n  # Unlock in sub-shell, so daemons with bad startup scripts\n  # (like Apache) don't inherit the look.\n  # Note that the lock is still alive in general because it's\n  # held by the outer shell.\n  eval \"exec $FLOCK_FD>-\"\n\n\n  # ... normal backup stuff from the original script ...\n\n  # Among other stuff the mentioned vicious line:\n  service apache2 start\n\n  # ... normal backup stuff from the original script ...\n)\n\n# Unlock in outer shell because we're done.\neval \"exec $FLOCK_FD>-\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 VIM without python support!

What is the best way to troubleshoot this?\nThe hardware is a Lenovo Thinkpad e410, with an Intel i3 processor, Intel graphics, and a hardware-encrypted Samsung SSD. Ubuntu is installed under UEFI, and the kernel version is 4.2.0-35.\nEverything was fine until a few days ago, except that graphics hardware acceleration was (sometimes? always?) not working correctly (images cutting into other windows, flashing blue, etc.). I eventually traced this to this bug and applied the fix suggested at #9, running \"sudo update-initramfs -u -k all\" afterwards. After the fix, the i915 driver did appear to load correctly, but it still did not appear to be working correctly. I then did two things: (1) updated the system, and (2) installed Flash for Firefox. Everything still appeared to be fine, with the exception of the graphics.\nThis morning, when I started my computer, the cursor was gone in Unity. I could still access the terminal, and decided to try undoing the above bug fix, running update-initramfs again afterwards. Rebooting, it froze at the urple screen. Rebooting via grub2's advanced menu, normal boot mode freezes at \"Loading initial ramdisk.\" Recovery mode loads the ramdisk, then generates a few screens worth of errors including:\nKernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\n...[5 lines + call traces omitted]...\n---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)\n...[more lines + call traces omitted]...\n---[ end trace ... ]---\n\nAnd that's it. Results are the same if I try booting into 4.2.0-27, in both normal (freezes at \"Loading initial ramdisk\") and recovery (lots of kernel panic output, then freeze) modes.\nI can try modifying grub boot options, but I'm not sure how to do this in grub2 or which options to try. Or I can try booting the live disk, mounting the hard drive, and poking around from there, but I don't really know where to begin.\nAny suggestions very much appreciated.\n\nA: I made the mistake of assuming all the background was part of the problem, when the problem was just that grub2 couldn't find the system:\nKernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs...\n\nI imagine the cause is that I forgot to run \"sudo update-grub2\" after running \"sudo update-initramfs.\"\nThe solution turned out to be to boot to a Live CD, mount and chroot to the hard drive, and re-run update-initramfs and update-grub2, as detailed here.\nTwo complications I encountered were:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"fdisk -l\" doesn't work on GPT volumes; you have to use \"gdisk -l\" instead.\n\n*I have /boot and / on different volumes, and / is encrypted. \n\n\nSo I needed to modify the mount sequence as follows:\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdaX sdaX_crypt\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/sdaX_crypt /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sdaY /mnt/boot\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nSo I am back into my system, though I still don't have a cursor. But that is another problem.\n\nA: I'm not sure on the etiquette, but since this ranks high in a web search I figured I'd leave my solve for the issue here as well. \nIn my case the problem came about after using a USB flash drive (for storage, this is not my boot device) in xubuntu, then restarting and booting into windows, flash drive still in. After shutting down windows, I physically removed the flash drive.\nOnce I booted back to xbuntu I got a black screen. After trying to load an older kernel, I got the above mentioned “Loading initial ramdisk” freeze. \nI fixed it by inserting the thumb drive into the same slot again, booting into windows, shutting down, then booting into xubuntu. I then unmounted the volume, removed it and restart without a problem. \nNote that I was not able to boot into xubuntu simply by inserting the flash drive again, I had to boot into windows first. \nHopefully this helps someone out there.\n", "Q: rsync can't exclude directories I run this cmd to backup my folders:\n$ rsync -av --exclude {/mnt/dati/Film/, /mnt/dati/Scout/} --delete /mnt/dati/ /media/cirelli/HD1TB/backup/dati\nsending incremental file list\n\nAnd rsync answer is:\nrsync: link_stat \"/mnt/dati/Scout/}\" failed: No such file or directory (2)\n\nbut \"Scout\" directory exist!

I tried running this command in terminal to give execution permission:\nchmod +x file.sh\n\nIt says cannot access file.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Unless the script requires it be in a particular location, you don't \"install\" a shell script, you just save it where you want it, and run it. It would also be advisable to read through the script first (by opening it in a text editor like Gedit) to make sure the script is safe. \nWays To Run A Shell Script\n1. Execute Script In A Specific Subshell\nIn this approach you specify which shell to run, and the path to the script you want that shell to run. Since you are executing a shell, and telling it which file to run, the script doesn't need execution permissions, which is nice from a security standpoint. Your default shell may be aware of where the shell you're running is located, in which case you won't need to specify the shell's path. Unless there are spaces in the file/folder names you don't need to wrap the shell path or script path in quotations. Some shells may not accept just a file path, they may require specific options, and formatting, but the idea is the same.\n \"/path/to/shell\" \"/path/to/script\"\n\nExamples:\n\"/bin/sh\" \"/home/user1/Downloads/script.sh\"\n\nbash /home/user1/Downloads/script\n\n2. Execute Script In Current Shell\nIn this approach you use your currently running shell, and the path to the script you want that shell to run. Since you are executing the script directly, the script needs execution permissions. Unless there are spaces in the file/folder names you don't need to wrap script path in quotations. \nchmod u+x,g+x,o+x \"/path/to/file.sh\"\n\n\"./path/to/file.sh\"\n\nExamples:\nchmod u+x \"/home/user1/Downloads/script.sh\"\n\n \"./home/user1/Downloads/script.sh\"\n\nSome things to keep in mind with this approach are that you may want to limit who can run the script. \"u+x\" gives the owner of the file permission to run it, \"g+x\" gives members of the group it's owned by to run it, and \"o+x\" gives everyone permissions to run it. The script will only work if it's compatible with the shell you are running. You only need to chmod the script once; in future you can proceed to the second command. You will only be able to chmod the script file if you have permission to edit that file. If you are not the owner of the script file, and do not have permission to chmod it, you can use Sudo to gain elevated permissions.\nExamples:\nsudo chmod u+x,g+x,o+x \"/home/user1/Downloads/script.sh\"\n\n \"./home/user1/Downloads/script.sh\"\n\n", "Q: Getting rid of mounted sd card notification on ubuntu touch?

Is lexar the only place to dowload this password to open usb stick technology? Why doesn't Cannonical sell this? \n\nA: The software you are mentioning isn't safer than the one built into Ubuntu. No need to purchase anything special. The software you are talking about uses \"256-bit AES encryption\" according to their website.\nYou can have an encryption using the same algorithm using the \"cryptsetup\" on Ubuntu with a regular thumb drive, see for example: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemsOnRemovableStorage\nThere is also a graphical frontend for this built into the \"gnome-disk-utility\". Have a look at this graphical tutorial, for example.\nBe aware that by using encryption technology on a thumb drive you will likely lose interoperability. This applies to the \"cryptsetup\" solution I'm proposing here (it will work out-of-the-box on Ubuntu and most other distros, but not on Windows) and even more to vendor-specific solutions like the Lexar software!\n", "Q: SSD Compatibility MacBook Pro 2010 (6,2) I just rebuilt this laptop (battery and HDD failure) and I went with a 1TB Samsung 850 Evo. I want to dual boot Ubuntu on it and ideally, I would like Ubuntu to really be my main operating system.\nI found this guide that seems to show that it doesn't like SSDs but then there's a section that talks about doing it anyways. Just want to see what the best way to do it is, if it's really even possible. I ask because the write up is quite dated and wasn't sure if maybe things have changed to make it easier to use SSDs or not?\nThanks in advance, and here are the system specs just in case. \n2.66 GHz i7\n4GB RAM (have 8GB on the way)\nGeForce GT 330M 512 MB\n\n\nA: According to the bug report linked to from the guide this appears to be fixable either by setting AHCI mode, or using EFI. I've only played with even older Macs, but back in those days I used rEFIt to set up an easy dual-boot; these days the working fork of rEFIt is rEFInd. In the bug report folks mention just using grub-efi, which is another option for you once Ubuntu is already installed, although something like rEFInd might make it easier to perform the installation in EFI mode in the first place, since it should be able to boot the USB or DVD you use for installation in EFI mode from the GUI boot menu.\nThe main caveat seems to be that the proprietary NVIDIA driver won't work if you boot via EFI. I don't know if that's still true, after all most of the comments in that bug report are from a few years ago, but you might find the default nouveau open-source driver will work just fine (honestly, in my experience it's often more stable, it just doesn't necessarily perform as well; chances are you aren't playing demanding 3D games on a 2010 Macbook anyways, however!).\n", "Q: Crash when trying to install Ubuntu I'm new to Linux and trying to set up a dual boot Ubuntu / Windows 10 system on a new Dell xps x8900.\nEach time I get midway through the boot-up process before I can even install, the system crashes into this:  \nhttps://goo.gl/photos/rypQ1DHbCDgpWQa38\nI've tried multiple different downloads to make sure that my isos aren't corrupted, and I've tried booting from both DVDs and USB sticks. \nhelp?\n\nA: Try to boot into the live cd (click try Ubuntu without installing) but pass the kernel this parameter: pci=noaer to disable PCIE Advanced Error Reporting.

The reason I think rc.local is being ignored is because the script it refers to should produce logs on script success but also on script fail, but there are no logs.\nCan anyone give me some pointers on how to troubleshoot this matter?\nPS : yes I know that putting stuff in /etc/fstab is also a way of mounting the drives, but when I'm not at home I hate it that I can see the drives on dolphin and have those little red crosses on them because the are not there. This way when I'm on the road (it is a laptop) people can't see what i have at home.\n\nA: only change this \nchmod 755 /etc/init.d/rc.local\n\nnano /etc/rc.local \n\nchange this in first line  \n#!/bin/sh -e\n\nto \n#!/bin/bash \n\nsave and enjoy!\n\nA: Ubuntu is now using systemd, and rc.local is now considered a service which is turned \"off\" by default. You can turn rc.local \"on\" by entering the following command and rebooting:\nsudo systemctl enable rc-local.service\n\n", "Q: Does the Ubuntu website use customary or SI definitions? On the \"Recommended System Requirements\" page for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, it gives the recommended system requirements—it gives one of these as \"2 GB system memory\".\nUbuntu the OS has switched to SI definitions for the prefixes used, so 1 GB = 109 bytes, not 230 bytes. However, most measurements of RAM use customary definitions, so 1 GB = 230 bytes.\nTherefore, when I see the recommended memory on the Ubuntu website being stated as \"2 GB\", should I assume they're saying 2×109 B or 2×230 B?\n\nA: RAM is always declared in octal values. There is no RAM that is manufactured to a specification of 1000 bytes == 1 KB. RAM is always marketed as GB, and is always 1024 bytes == 1 KB.\nThe use of GiB versus GB is primarily for storage, where Hard Drive and other storage device manufacturers have generally always used 1000 bytes == 1 KB, and to make the difference clear in the user interface.\nIf you believe for some reason that the web site is inaccurate, there is a link at the bottom of every page for Report a bug on this site, where you can report the issue.\n", "Q: What command is the most effective for listing processes? I've seen lots of developers use ps -ef to list processes and kill them (such as in ENCOM, devs of OS-12).\nHowever, there is also htop. A friend told me that it is only a wrapper around ps and therefore that therefore there is no difference.\nWhat's the difference between ps and htop? Is one able to list more processes? Which one is better to use?\n\nA: The 'ps' command only displays processes.  htop by default shows each thread as a separate process. Which implies 'htop' will always show more items than 'ps'.\nWe can show per-thread statistics with the 'ps' command as well.\nfor ex:\nps -Lf | grep xyz.sh\n\nWhich one to use ?\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are looking for threads status of a single process - htop\n\n*If you are calculating CPU, memory usage - ps\nOne can get the info from both the commands. But default view makes the difference here. For ex: To check the memory used by a process, One should look at the process level, since threads share memory. So, ps is preferable. But, we can configure htop as well.\nTo turn off the display of threads for htop, press H, or use the \"Setup / Display options\" menu, \"Hide userland threads\". This puts the following line in your ~/.htoprc or ~/.config/htop/htoprc (Recent versions do not use ~/.htoprc, but rather ~/.config/htop/htoprc):\nhide_userland_threads=1\n\n", "Q: error: Setup script exited with error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1 I ran the following commands in the terminal for a 14.04 Ubuntu server\n$ cd reddit/r2\n$ python setup.py build\n$ sudo python setup.py develop\n\nAfter the last line I get an error, please see bellow the lines from the terminal.\nroot@dedi-fr-32312:~# cd reddit/r2\nroot@dedi-fr-32312:~/reddit/r2# python setup.py build\nCannot find Cython.

No amount of tinkering with /proc or php.ini will fix this.  You've got three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the size of the swap space.\n\n*Install more RAM.\n\n*Re-write your program to be more memory-efficient.\n\n", "Q: Kubuntu Boot Up Speed It's been suggested I move to Kubuntu, GCC, and open GL for these small but critical applications.\nBut Kubuntu 11.0 takes over 10 minutes to boot with a CF card for a drive and an AMD GX466 CPU.\nThe application I am attempting to port over to Kubuntu from DOS takes about 20 seconds to boot.\nSeriously, is that standard for Kubuntu? I read that Linux is not a good choice for mission critical embedded applications. Perhaps this is why and why DOS continues to be used in these critical apps.\nIs there some way to get Kubuntu to boot in 20 seconds. We only need SVGA, network packet driver, and a USB mouse to be loaded as drivers.\n\nA: The speed of boot depends on two things: hardware and software.\nThe more the software does (GUI, animations, background tasks, user management, shell execution, etc) the slower your computer. Kubuntu does a lot more than DOS. If DOS is working for you and does everything you need.\nIf you need new features, Lubuntu may boot faster than Kubuntu. It's lighter and does less.\nNow the hardware. I have a top of the range PC with 32GB RAM, 6 x Intel i7 at 3200 MHz cores and a 2TB HDD at 90MB/s.\nYou have an old computer with a small amount of RAM, a 333 MHz processor (an order of magnitude slower). You also have a CF card with 30 MB/s read / write.\nYou wouldn't expect this guy to lift these weights.\n \nEqually, you can't expect this computer to do all this.\n \n\nA: Kubuntu is the version of Ubuntu that runs the K Desktop Environment, a fully-featured desktop OS, and is one of the \"chunkier\" flavors of Ubuntu. Once installed, it tends to run a bit faster than when booted off of a \"Live\" image, but it will still be slow on your (very limited) hardware.\nIf you need an up-to-date (but lightweight) graphical environment, I would second Tim's suggestion of using Lubuntu instead, but on your hardware even Lubuntu would not be fast.\nHowever, if you are comfortable on the Linux command line and do not need a graphical user interface (GUI), take a look at Ubuntu Server -- it will allow you to install a command-line-only system (not necessarily a server), without a GUI. This would probably run reasonably on your hardware.\n", "Q: Can't connect to WPA Enterprise wifi after upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04 After upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04, I can't connect to my university's wifi (eduroam), which uses WPA2 Enterprise security.

Do I have to do a clean install, or can I upgrade while still in 14.04 (like how Windows allows you to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to 10)?\nI'm just worried that I would have to backup my files, uninstall 14.04, and then install 16.04. \n\nA: You can either:\na) Upgrade from 14.04 LTS, although you should wait for the offficial upgrade offer made by the software updater (somewhere in July) since the Canonical team releases that simple update in July, once everything's been checked. Alternatively, you can force upgrade right away.\nHere's how: http://www.tecmint.com/upgrade-ubuntu-14-04-to-16-04/\nor \nb) (recommended): Do a clean install (by booting and erase disk and install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS throught the installation disk/USB), which makes things less likely to go wrong (kernel upgrades, other applications support, since it's officially not validated for upgrade).

However, from my understanding, 15.10 goes out of support in a couple months.

Instead of downloading ubuntu is it more expedient to just purchase an ubuntu cd from an online source?\n\nA: It totally depends on your internet connection. For most people with a high-speed connection, downloading Ubuntu is relatively fast (though it could take up to a few hours, depending on various factors) and therefore not a problem. \nHowever, if you have a very slow connection or a prohibitive \"data cap\" on your data plan, you may want to buy an Ubuntu DVD, or a USB drive with Ubuntu pre-loaded on it, instead of downloading it yourself.\nPlease note that the Ubuntu Desktop installer is too large to fit on a CD, so any optical disc you buy with Ubuntu on it will be a DVD instead.\n\nA: It's a matter of personal choice and your internet connectivity.It's relatively easy to download the image and burn it to USB than to go and buy a CD (in my personal opinion). If you are on a slow connection then it's always easy to buy a CD.\n\nA: I wouldnt pay much as it's free. if you do buy it try to buy from ubuntu so the proceeds go to further development of ubuntu further more I belive you can download a minimal .iso and add programs and such as you need them. \n", "Q: PulseAudio fails to set card profile to 'a2dp_sink'.

You can install it with sudo apt install pavucontrol -y. Then run pavucontrol from the command line or Alt+F2 if you are on Kubuntu and entering pavucontrol.\nSelect the configuration tab and then try changing the profile for your headphones and see if that updates for you. There seem to be a bug with bluetooth a2dp still in linux and it affects two of my 16.04 installations. If it already says A2DP change it to OFF, disconnect the device in the bluetooth applet, then reconnect it. Then finally proceed to change the profile back to A2DP and it should work.\nYou can also try the following on the command line and it should tab complete most of it for you.

Your results may vary by a few seconds +/- 5 seconds. Edit regarding a potential pitfall. I did find that it's is occasionally needed to run the larger script twice before it works. I'm not sure if increasing the sleep times would help or not as I haven't tested that. But I have used it on two machines with the same brand of BT headphones and it's doing what it's supposed to for automating the process to get the sound working on the headphones.\nEventually the issue will be patched in the bluetooth package but seems to keep returning in new releases of Ubuntu as well as other versions of Linux. But anyhow hope that helps for you\n\nA: So, if you are using Debian you can do the following: Refused to switch profile to a2dp_sink: Not connected\nProblem\nBluetooth headset is connected, but ALSA/PulseAudio fails to pick up the connected device or there's no device to pick. This happens because GDM captures A2DP sink on session start, as GDM needs pulseaudio in the gdm session for accessibility. For example, the screen reader requires it.\nSolution\nIn order to prevent GDM from capturing the A2DP sink on session start, edit /var/lib/gdm3/.config/pulse/client.conf (or create it, if it doesn't exist):\nautospawn = no\ndaemon-binary = /bin/true\n\nAfter that you have to grant access to this file to Debian-gdm user:\nchown Debian-gdm:Debian-gdm /var/lib/gdm3/.config/pulse/client.conf\n\nYou will also need to disable pulseaudio startup:\nrm /var/lib/gdm3/.config/systemd/user/sockets.target.wants/pulseaudio.socket\n\nIn order to auto-connect a2dp for some devices, add this to /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nReboot.\n\nA: This fixed a set-card-profile issue for me: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/1181106/comments/15\nQuote:\n1) Modify the /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf\n================================\n\n[General]\nEnable = Source,Sink,Headset,Gateway,Control,Media\nDisable = Socket\n\nHFP=false\n\n[A2DP]\nSBCSources=1\nMPEG12Sources=0\n\n2) Check for pulseaudio module :\n==========================\n\n$ pactl list | grep -i module-bluetooth\n\nIf you dont have :\n     module-bluetooth-policy\n     module-bluetooth-discover\n     module-bluetooth-device\n\nJust do :\n$ sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n$ pulseaudio -k\n$ pactl load-module module-bluetooth-device\n$ pactl load-module module-switch-on-connect\n\n3) Connect the bluetooth headset\n===========================\n\nUse blueman to pair, and connect audio sink\nUse pavucontrol to change for A2DP (even if blueman said \"audio profile off\")\n\nPlease confirm that works for you too.\n\n\nA: I had this problem on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, and applying the GDM work around found in https://wiki.debian.org/BluetoothUser/a2dp solved it. \nSpecifically, create/edit /var/lib/gdm3/.config/pulse/client.conf to read:\nautospawn = no\ndaemon-binary = /bin/true\n\nThen \nsudo chown gdm:gdm /var/lib/gdm3/.config/pulse/client.conf\n\nI also added to /etc/pulse/default.pa\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nThough this might not be strictly necessary.\nAfter a reboot, I connected via bluetooth manager was able to successfully switch the audio profile to a2dp_sink.\n\nA: As documented in here, It is because GDM captures A2DP sink on session start, as GDM needs pulseaudio in the gdm session for accessibility. \nTry to add this to \"/var/lib/gdm3/.config/pulse/default.pa\", or create it, then reboot:\n\n#!/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF\n#\n\n# load system wide configuration\n.include /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n### unload driver modules for Bluetooth hardware\n.ifexists module-bluetooth-policy.so\n  unload-module module-bluetooth-policy\n.endif\n\n.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so\n  unload-module module-bluetooth-discover\n.endif\n\n\nA: I'm sure that the previous answers actually try to address the root cause of the problem. I, however, was not able to get any of them to work. I had the exact same issue as OP, but on Linux Mint 17/18. I wrote this script to reliably get bluetooth connected and using a2dp.\nCopy/pasted for posterity, but the brunt of the matter is that it exactly replicates what the OP (and I) would have to do in the UI.\nThe script by Dominik wouldn't reliably work for me, because it would only try once to set everything up. I'd have to run it multiple times to get it to work.

If I have Skype running I'm unable to set a2dp_sink profile.\nSo, if you run into this issue, see if you have Skype running and turn it off.\n\nA: systemctl restart bluetooth\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open sound settings (accessible by clicking on the speaker icon in the tray)\n\n*Try and change the Output profile to A2DP Sink.\n\n*If that doesn't work, change your device to Speakers, or something else and then switch it back.\n\n*I usually find that I can then set my Output profile\n\n\nA: I chose to solve it with a udev rule, as I am the only user of the system, so $USER, $XAUTHORITY and $DISPLAY are well-known.\nPerhaps this is useful for someone that wants a solution defined in a single file, running on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.\nThe hook is triggered via the input subsystem because the speaker appears to be fully initialized at this stage.\n# file: /etc/udev/rules.d/99-jbl-go2.rules\n# fix JBL GO2 with CSR bluetooth: switch to a2dp profile upon connect\n# byteborg 20190110\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{name}==\"70:99:1C:41:C6:EB\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority\", RUN+=\"/bin/su alpha -c '/usr/bin/pacmd set-card-profile bluez_card.70_99_1C_41_C6_EB a2dp_sink'\"\n\nThe Archlinux Wiki mentions Cambridge Silicon Radio devices providing the wrong profile at connect (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#A2DP_sink_profile_is_unavailable). I can acknowledge this behaviour with a \"JBL GO 2\" bluetooth speaker, misbehaving like already mentioned. a2dp seems to be available a short while after connect -- perhaps a timing issue?\n\nA: On Elementary OS Hera 5.1.7 (based on 18.04.4) using kernel 5.8.0-39 (necessary for hardware compatibility reasons), I was able to resolve this issue by\n\n*\n\n*installing pavucontrol and blueman\nand\n\n*editing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\n\"MultiProfile=multiple\" under \"general\"\n(see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#A2DP_not_working_with_PulseAudio)\nchange \"AutoEnable=false\" (not sure if that did anything)\n\nBefore this, I couldn't connect to bluetooth audio sinks, period, unless I used bluetoothctl. At that point, it would only connect to the duplex low quality sink (HSP/HFP) and not A2DP (high audio quality).\nNow it appears to be able to work well enough in either mode, with mode-switching on the fly, however, with consistent errors:\n[  994.225669] Bluetooth: hci0: urb 0000000085e83e50 submission failed (90)\n[  994.225675] Bluetooth: hci0: sending frame failed (-90)\n[  994.238145] Bluetooth: hci0: SCO packet for unknown connection handle 0\n[  994.238153] Bluetooth: hci0: SCO packet for unknown connection handle 0\n[  994.238155] Bluetooth: hci0: SCO packet for unknown connection handle 0\n[  994.238157] Bluetooth: hci0: SCO packet for unknown connection handle 0\n\n\nA: None of the solutions described here worked consistently for me since I do not have a fixed schedule when I turn my bluetooth speaker on. Which, if it matters, is a Sony SRS-XB22\nBut what does work after I connect to my speaker is that I set the card profile to off, small pause and then set it to a2dp_sink.\nMore precisely, I get the number of the bluetooth device by\npactl list cards short\n\nIt's #3 usually right after I start the device, and I just run\npacmd set-card-profile 3 off && sleep 0.5 && pacmd set-card-profile 3 a2dp_sink\n\n", "Q: How to run a command at login So I've been looking around and I can find ways to run commands every time you open a new terminal and inadvertently figured out how to make a continuous loop of opening terminals. \nI've edited .bashrc .bash_login .bash_profile .bash_alias .profile (each separately) and nothing has worked besides the .profile and .bash_alias but this happens EVERY time I open a new terminal. I even made my own scrip and added it to the /.config/startup/ .desktop Nothing..\nAll I want is when I login a terminal opens (already set in startup app) then run something like ls -l and df -h or whatever else I could want further down the line.\nEven better if there's some way to open another terminal after that to work from and without creating that continuous loop..\nThis is what I want my desktop to look like at login:\n \nThanks!\n\nA: What you want is this:\ngnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"df;bash\"' \n\nThe gnome-terminal by default runs any single command passed to it as single shot and exits. Thus you want to call a single command capable of running multiple, which is what bash -c \"df;bash\" does - it will run df, then spawn another instance of bash and prevent window from exiting one df completes execution.\nFinally, add that to startup applications\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 login loop Unity terminated with status 1 I have ubuntu 14.04 and am stuck in a login loop problem despite trying the common answers to the multitude of questions on the site ,none have worked.

Sometimes it'll play properly, sometimes just audio, and sometimes not at all. \nWhy does Ubuntu Touch support the proprietary codec H.264, but not the open-source codec VP8/VP9? Even stranger, YouTube plays VP9 just fine in the browser. \nIs there a way to play WebM on Ubuntu Touch yet? \n\nA: I'd say you Ubuntu touch device doesn't have support for hardware decoding of WebM where as most phones and tablets e.g. the M10 will have hardware which decodes H.264 so it doesn't take up time on the main CPU while playing H.264 videos.\nI'm sure you can install something to play WebM especially if you get the phone/tablet into read/write mode, that said I doubt it would perform very well.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 server ports are closing on their own I am running squirrelmail, apache2, and postfix on Ubuntu 16.04 server edition.

Recently I have installed Ubuntu 16.04LTS Gnome on my iMac with Sierra Mac OS X. The reason was that OS became sluggish and I wanted something faster (and after 17th years with Linux the solution was obvious). I follower a nice tutorial Ubuntu on iMac\nEverything went great until rebooting the iMac after Ubuntu installation. The only booting system was Linux, moreover I could not see the GRUB menu... Hopefully it was booting) The Linux works great, just some Wireless and graphic drivers were missing (used Xorg instead), but after plugging it via Ethernet cable to my modem I made all updates and installed the drivers. A link to Wifi drivers installation:\nUbuntu mac wifi drivers\nGraphic drivers are selectable via Sytem settings GUI\nSo, coming back to dual booting Linux and Mac OS X. I played around with GRUB, none of the methods worked for me!!! Pressing \"Option key\" did not work any more (GRUB has overwritten the iMacs MBR). \nI almost gave up to make it before weekend, but then I tried rEFInd:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rodsmith/refind\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install refind\n\nwas everything I needed to get my dual boot working perfect for Linux and Mac OS X. Now I have at the boot rEFInd booting menu and easily select between booting partitions.\nThe only problem remained  is still with GRUB splash menu, I cannot see any options I guess due to some wrong graphic menu. I tried console mode, I does not work, some error message about graphical regime at the boot.

Thank you.\nUpdate:\nLooks like the process isn't sending data anymore, I installed nethogs to monitor live data transfer and everything seem totally normal. \n\nA: Then nethogs command line utility will show you the network usage of every process on your system.
