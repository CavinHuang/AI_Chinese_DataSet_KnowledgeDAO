["Q: Can i do a fresh install ontop of outdated Ubuntu? I have an outdated version of Ubuntu. Can I back up my files, download the latest version to a disk & do a complete fresh install of the latest version? Or do I need to uninstall the outdated version first? Sorry I am a beginner in Linux & trying to learn :)\n\nA: Installing over the top is fine, just chose Erase this disk and install or Install over Ubuntu XX.xx. Make sure you have a backup and a list of programs.\nHowever, you could upgrade it, preserving your documents etc, by running the command sudo update-manager -d - Wouldn't work for version 10.04.\n\nA: Installing directly over the old version is the most stable and easiest way to upgrade. You could use a backup program like Aptik to back up your added repos and program configuration files, then use the file manager to backup your personal files to an external drive or use a cloud storage program like Dropbox.\nJust choose to install over your old Ubuntu when installing with the Live CD, and it'll overwrite over the old version. This is also works if you need to overwrite another Ubuntu based distro such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\n", "Q: After install, how to get ubuntu to boot from HDD? How do i get my pc to know that ubuntu is on a certain hdd to boot it? Currently its installed on a hdd with 2 partitions- does that matter?\nTried going into system BIOS and picking the hdd with no luck. \n\nA: Normally I'd comment to get this information, but I guess I need 50 reputation to comment? Seems silly.\nAnyway, this seems likely to be a problem with GRUB. What happens when you boot? We really need more information.\nSome things to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug all peripherals from USB ports except for mouse and keyboard (in case it's trying to boot from, say, your plugged in phone or, more likely, the live USB that you used to install ubuntu).\n\n*Remove any CDs from the drives, as well.\n\n*Make sure that the HDD is set to be the first boot device in the BIOS\nWhen you boot, your computer does the following:\n   1. Looks for the BIOS\n   2. Looks at your boot devices, IN THE ORDER THEY ARE SPECIFIED IN THE BIOS. This is where you want to make sure your HDD is set to be the first in the list\n    3. If it finds something it thinks it CAN boot from (say, a USB drive like I said above) it will try to boot from it. If in fact it CAN'T boot from that, it will just hang at a black screen.\nKeep this in mind as you try to troubleshoot it, and please get us some more information if these steps don't help.\n", "Q: external monitor can't display max resolution I had been using an external monitor, an old Dell Inc. 19\" with Ubuntu 14.04 for a while now, The resolution it displayed at was something like 1366x768 or 1366x1024, I can't remember exactly which one it was. However, one day when I restarted my computer, I can no longer get that resolution on the external display, and can now display a max resolution of 1024x768. Does anyone know why this might happen all of a sudden? I think it was after running a system update.\n\nA: So I'm not exactly sure why this worked, but I managed to fix the problem. The external monitor is hooked up to my Lenovo Thinkpad X220 laptop, and on it there is an option for changing which screen is showing what. (Fn + F7) I pressed this by accident, and it switched to both of the screens showing the same thing. When I pressed it again, the resolution on the external monitor seems to have gone back to normal.\nNot sure why this worked, but it did!\n", "Q: Retired XP machines - which version to install? I retired several P4 3.4Ghz PCs with 2GB RAM at the office. The hardware is still working but 4-5 years old. Which version of Ubuntu can I use to make these PCs useful. Never used Ubuntu before. \n\nA: I would advise either lubuntu (running very well on my computer) or xubuntu, as these are lightweight. They are both pretty fast, although lubuntu is noticeably faster.\nIf you want the features, go for Xubuntu, or the speed and similarity to windows, lubuntu. Either of the desktops, installed alongside unity are good, but I advise the while OS as it isn't slow at any point (e.g. logging in when it is just the desktop is painful, as it uses the 14.04 login screen)\nUbuntu with Unity would run on them, however some things may slow it down, and it may be frustrating. XFCE and LXDE would be much faster - even than XP was!\nI have a single core intel celeron with 512MB, and it runs faster than XP - it's now use able!\n\nA: *\n\n*700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n\n*512 MiB RAM (system memory)\n\n*5 GB of hard-drive space (or USB stick, memory card or external drive but see LiveCD for an alternative approach)\n\n*VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution\n\n*Either a CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installer media\n\n*Internet access is helpful\n\n\nThis is a Recommended Minimum System Requirements from a official site ubuntu\nIf you use a Unity (default Ubuntu grapfic environment) u should have:\n\n\n*\n\n*1000 ΜHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n\n*1024 MiB RAM (system memory)\n\n*3D Acceleration Capable Videocard with at least 256 MB\n\n", "Q: I updated ubuntu to 14.04 and nautilus disappeared I'm sorry im all new to this. I don't know how to activate nautilus.. The sidebar with my desktop icons disappeared also. I can't do anything. Please help..\n\nA: It sounds like something went wrong with your window manager.\nTry opening a console (ctrl+alt+T) and typing nautilus.\nThis should open up nautilus to your /home/user folder. If this works, but your sidebar is still missing, you may wish to try\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will likely take a while (as it re downloads and reconfigures a bunch of files) but should, hopefully, solve your issues.\n\nA: (ctrl+alt+F1) and you will switch out of your X session.

I don't have any other OS installed and the USB is listed asi Boot Option #1.\nAFAIK, the laptop only support EFI.\n\nA: Power the laptop on with USB stick connected already. Some BIOSes don't recognize some USB drives that are connected after power on. And by the way: remember to have Ubuntu USB stick formatted as FAT32 file system, not NTFS. NTFS USB stick will boot, but will also fail to continue shortly after that.\n\nA: perhaps it's worth trying another boot tool -- Rufus, pay attention to when creating USB stick,\nthe target system should be EFI or UEFI\nand some reference info:\nEven page is for win10, Ubuntu is almost same.\nClick here\nand also pay attention to the BIOS setting as @user280493 pointed out, the first boot option should be \"USB disk EFI usbDiskName\", because some BIOS distinguish \"USB disk EFI usbDiskName\" and \"USB disk usbDiskName\"\n", "Q: Translating to Bash Command So for a project for school I had to install the DPJ extension to the Java language.

I know I have to open up the /etc/profile file and add 2 lines (or for the PATH one do I just append something to the top line of the file after a colon?).

If it helps I run Ubuntu 14.04 on Virtualbox (and have little to no experience)\n\nA: export DPJ_ROOT=\"$Home/dpjbin\"\nPATH+=\":${DPJ_ROOT}/Implementation/bin\"\n\nPATH is already exported, so you don't have to do that.\n", "Q: Trying to build/install patched gtk3-engines-oxygen to test bugfix, get shared changelog.Debian.gz is different from other instances of package I want to just quickly test the patch in this bug report to gtk3-engines-oxygen so it can go upstream.

Answering a recent question, and before that, trying to see if a patch which is fundamental for my machine had been included in a kernel release, I have found the following problem: \nHow can I match the kernel version I have for my kernel, which is \n[:~] % uname -a\nLinux samsung-romano 3.13.0-29-generic #53-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 4 21:00:20 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nwith the exact kernel source, which I suppose should be stored in http://kernel.ubuntu.com/git?p=ubuntu/linux.git;a=summary?\nIn that page there are quite a lot of tags, for example: \n\nBut none of them correspond to 3.13.0-29 which is my running kernel right now. \nThe mapping should be in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/ExtendedStable, where it is said that the 3.13 Ubuntu kernel is based on 3.13.11 --- I think.

I previously had windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 loaded on it. I attempted to update ubuntu 12.04 earlier today which came up with an error during the update. I decided to try and reinstall ubuntu on the partion that already had it with 14.04 from a usb. Upon doing so, I accidentally erased  windows 7 by picking the option that said replace Ubuntu 12.04 (I figured it would leave my other partition alone, I was wrong).

I have found the SourceForge repository, but it only has .h and .c files and I do not know how to build them into a .dll.\nCan anyone give me a link to download, or instructions to build my missing .dlls?\n\nA: I think this DLL came from Wine, so you could make a new Wine prefix: \nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine-bak winecfg\n\nAnd then copy the DLL from ~/.wine-bak/drive_c/windows/system32/ole32.dll.\nI tried a locate and came up with this:\nmohanan@mohanan-laptop:~$ locate ole32.dll\n/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/ole32.dll.so\n/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/fakedlls/ole32.dll\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/ole32.dll.so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine/fakedlls/ole32.dll\n\nYou could copy one of these, but I am not sure which one you'll need, exactly.\n\nA: Try to install wine by using -f:\nsudo apt-get install -f wine\n\nIf that doesn't work then you might be forced to uninstall then re-install wine.\n\nA: Aha!

As I understand it, the windows are Openbox. Is this correct?\nI went in to the Openbox settings to try to set the theme there but that same theme isn't listed there. Is there a way to use the \"QtCurve\" theme for the windows?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot use QtCurve with Openbox.\nOpenbox uses a totally different theme format from Kwin.

I am hopeful that it has the fix for this issue!\nQuestion 1: Does the stable 3.15 kernel indeed contain the fix (kernel patch 4096321)?\nQuestion 2: What is the next Ubuntu release that will contain this kernel (and hence contain the fix that I need)?\nQuestion 3: If I can't bear to wait until the next Ubuntu release, then what is the next Ubuntu test kernel (I'm assuming from kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/?C=N;O=D but correct me if I'm wrong) that would have the fix?\nQuestion 4: If I want to install the test kernel that is the answer to question 3, can I do that safely without leaving 14.04 LTS? I really want to stay on an LTS version of Ubuntu. I'm not looking to upgrade Ubuntu every 6 months. I just want to make my trackpad work and then not make any further changes to my system for a few years (except automated updates, of course).\nThanks in advance!\nPS. I'm new to Linux/Ubuntu so forgive me if some of my questions are badly asked.\nUpdate:\nThanks for the answers. I finally upgraded the kernel to one of the stable 3.15 versions from here (delay was mostly due to me being afraid of the unknown, particularly of breaking my computer). I'm half-happy to report that the touchpad now half-works. Specifically, it works after computer startup, but stops working after suspend+resume.\n\nA: *\n\n*It is queued for 3.15, so it should be present in that version.\n\n*Utopic will get kernel 3.15.\n\n*I think you'll have to request the fix be backported to the 3.12 kernel. As part of Ubuntu policy, kernel versions remain the same on a given release.\n\n*Because this is an LTS release, you'll be able to use newer kernels in Trusty. If the 12.04.x schedule on this page is to be followed, you'll get 3.15 about 3 months after Utopic is released.\n\n\nA: To answer your questions: At the bottom of the patch page you linked it says that the patch is present in 3.15. Kernel version 3.15 has been released, and version 3.16 will be the default kernel in Utopic Unicorn. If you want to install kernel 3.15 in Ubuntu 14.04, download the appropriate packages (what are they?) from the mainline kernel PPA or install them using apt and ppa technology, which I recommend, because then you keep your kernel updated. Be aware that other issues may come up when you install a newer kernel.\n", "Q: CCSM not saving any changes made I'm making changes with ccsm to the unity plugin, mainly to disable a whole ton of useless keyboard shortcuts which just take fullscreen applications out of focus and cause other problems.\nThe changes however, are all being undone every reboot and when I run ccsm again, all the changes are showing as there, but all the shortcuts become re-enabled.  I then have to restore each one to default again, and re-disable it, only to have it happen on the next reboot.\nHow do I get it to save the changes and actually, save the changes instead of just showing them saved?\n\nA: At this page https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz_Configuration\nYou will know about this file:\n~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/Default.ini\nAlso you will have to opt for the \"Flat-file configuration backend\" for the below to work.\nSo, to FORCE your settings you can do this:\nFirst of all: backup your ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/Default.ini\nNow, simply put ccsm at startup applications, it will ensure applying Default.ini configurations, as otherwise that file may still be ignored.\nIf that still doesnt work, you can try this also:\nOpen your ccsm, go in Preferences/Profile/Export, so you can save your preferences.\nNow, copy your preferences to ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/.\nStill there, backup the Default.ini file.\nNow rename your preferences file to Default.ini.\nMy changes finally persisted after boot!\n", "Q: Getting ADB to run I've recently installed ubuntu and I need Android SDK (and subsequently, adb) in order to develop my apps to college.

While installing I haven't created any Partition. I am trying to create one now, but it not allowing me to do that, saying, 'The device is busy'. Please help.\n\nA: How did you install Ubuntu? Also, is it Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10? It probably isn't a big deal, but it could be.\nAssuming you booted from your hard drive, you're in luck - you have already made a partition, perhaps without knowing it. If instead you meant that you wanted to make multiple partitions here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Live boot into your system, the same way as when you first installed (disk or flash drive)\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Type ´ sudo gparted´\n\n*Look for your hard drive in 'devices' on the right. It's likely to be /dev/sdb but maybe not, so watch out.\n\n*Make sure the device's pprtitions are unmounted (right click them and if it says unmount, do it)\n\n*Your hard drive us likely set up with one large partition and one swap partition. For the purposes of this, wipe out the swap partition (look for the delete/remove button)\n\n*Right click your main partion and click 'move/resize'\n\n*Resize your partition to how big you want it to be. Warning: shirt from the RIGHT not the LEFT as doing this could ruin your bootloader\n\n*Select the area now known as 'unallocated slave's right click, and click to create a new partition.

I have a feeling some will consider this a duplicate, but please hear me out.  I've been reading tons of questions and threads around this but have never really found an answer for this specifically.\nI want to shrink my NTFS partition to make room for a Ubuntu install, so I can dual boot them.  However when shrinking the NTFS volume in Windows disk management, it will only go so far as the MFT is sitting near the end of the volume.  I've read plenty of posts about why it does this, and how difficult/dangerous it is to move the MFT etc.  I've also read that Perfect Disk can apparently do it under it's trial period, but I remain cautious to try this method.  I was wondering however if the disk partitioning utility included in the Ubuntu install wizard handles the moving of the MFT when dragging the partition boundaries.  It all seems too simple that you simply tell it the new size you want it to be.  Would it tell me if it couldn't resize by the amount you requested if the MFT was an issue, or move it for you if it were able.  I'm concerned it might corrupt the MFT and the volume, even though I doubt the install wizard would be so daft.\nSo what exactly is the deal with the partition resizing tool in the Ubuntu install wizard?  Will it safely resize my NTFS volume despite the location of my MFT?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First of all BACKUP your data. Ubuntu installation does not cover all possible operations with partition moving/resizing, it is mostly for delete/create/add partiotion, but gparted does. The official documentation says also \n\"Parted Partition Editor\nIf you decide to use GParted, you have to remember to uncheck the 'round to cylinders' checkbox , otherwise GParted will dutifully move the entire partition to align it with cylinder boundaries. Unfortunately this takes a long time, and when it's finished, usually results in booting problems. This is because the Windows boot loader depends on block addressing to find parts of itself, so when the partition is moved a little, it gets all mixed up and disjointed. Sometimes it can fix itself automatically but other times it requires repairs from the Windows Installation Disc. If you just remove the check mark you will find that GParted will be able to complete the NTFS resize in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise and afterwards Windows will boot just fine.  \"\nread more here\nSo you might need to run Gparted from Ubuntu Live CD before you run Installation.\nYou can also move/resize your NTFS partition form Windows. I used Partition Wizard many times on NTFS and never had problems. Gparted worked fine as well.\n", "Q: Wireless problem with Broadcom BCM4313 I have wireless connection problem can't connect my wireless\nlspci -vvnn | grep 14e4\n\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]:

Reason for the question being that I ran a deployment where openstack used 10.0.0.0 as its management network, MAAS DHCP and DNS were active; however, I could only access VMs through namespace and was not able to utilize MAAS's DHCP to assign floating IP. \n(VMs network was through an internal bridge 10.10.10.10, and external bridge was using the same interface as MAAS.) Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated.\n\nA: You can use 10.0.0.0/24 for both the management network and the external network; in your MAAS configuration, allocate a subset of the IP range for physical server provisioning, and then once OpenStack is deployed, you can configure Neutron to use a different subset of the 10.0.0.0/24 IP range - Neutron will manage this as a separate pool so there is no dependency on floating IP's being allocated by MAAS DHCP.\nMake sure that you have two network interfaces cables to 10.0.0.0/24 on the server running the quantum-gateway charm and use 'eth2' as the ext-port configuration.\n", "Q: Add Nodes to MAAS for JUJU Bundle This question is similar to Can juju add-machine be used to prepare a machine for service deployment?, with some differences; however. I am trying to find the fastest way of deploying juju bundles on target nodes. I suppose the proper way of doing so is to bring the required number of target nodes to \"Ready\" state, and while they are powered off, deploy the bundle, turn the nodes on and let them eventually get to \"allocated\" state. To speed up the process, I typically issue a number of \"juju add-machine\" to upload the desired image to the target nodes that are already in \"Ready\" state and let them get allocated. To allow for a bundle to provision existing machines, I then select the allocated nodes and stop them, from MAAS drop down menu. This puts the desired nodes in \"Ready\" state, once again, while powered on. Deploying a bundle will provision the nodes, and puts them in \"allocated\" state. This generally works well. The only snag is that upon reboot, target node goes through pxe boot again, wiping out all the charms and juju deamon. Is there a better way of doing this?\n\nA: You can use constraints in a bundle to limit the type of machine that each service (unit) gets deployed to, but options are somewhat limited. Telling Juju to co-locate two or more services on a given machine is definitely doable. I suggest taking a look at Juju Deployer's placement documentation to get an idea of what is possible, and how you can edit the bundle file.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove nouveau driver from a dual graphics system?

The problem is that you have to first move to the EFI partition, rename the BCD file, then run the bootrec /fixmbr, bootrec /fixboot, and bootrec /rebuildbcd commands.\nSee this tutorial: http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2013/12/how-to-repair-the-efi-bootloader-in-windows-8/#.VAQWdDJdU4o\nThen after step 3:\nEnter: bootrec /fixmbr [Press Enter]\nEnter: bootrec /fixboot [Press Enter]\nEnter: bootrec /rebuildbcd [Press Enter]\n\nIt will ask you which installations you want to rebuild the BCD file for. I just entered All. Then I restarted and all was back to normal. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: Where to see the complete list of juju charms available? that sounds like such a basic question to ask, but I can't seem to find a good answer.\nWhere to see the complete list of juju charms available?\nExcept for the official 'Juju Charms Store' website which is, in my opinion, totally unusable (and search doesn't work for me), I can't seem to find anything.\nI would like to have something like NPM repository search where I can see all packages available and search through them in a convenient way. \nFor now all that I can see are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Juju Charms Store (and search doesn't work for me)\n\n*A mirror of Charms on GitHub (but I can't seem to find out how good, accurate, recent is the list, 'nginx' charm isn't in the list for example, which is odd)\n\n\nA: Edit: The new location to view all charms is https://charmhub.io\n\nBecause the search is not working for you, you can find a list of the promoted charms here: http://manage.jujucharms.com/charms\nThere is also a massive list of all of the charms on launchpad here: https://code.launchpad.net/charms\n", "Q: how to list all directories and a specific line inside a file in that directory My server has hosted many websites for testing/dev purposes. My problem is that my mysql server has around 95% load. So, I want to list all the directories and the db lines from config.php. Things like \nlike foo-dev : db@mysql01\n\n\nA: You should be able to use the find command to search your document root directory recursively for config.php files, then pass the results to the grep command to check for your search string e.g.\nfind /var/www -name 'config.php' -exec grep -l 'db@mysql01' {} \\;\n\nThe -l flag to grep tells it to output the full name of the file (including the parent directory) instead of the actual matching text. You may need to modify the /var/www/ part if you are using non-standard file locations. NB I don't know if db@mysql01 is actually an appropriate search string - it may need to be something like db_name = xxx.\nAlternatively you might try examining your mysql and/or webserver logs, or using network tools like lsof to identify what processes have open connections to the mysql server.\n", "Q: GCC 4.8.1 to GCC 4.6.3 i am using ubuntu 12.04.

Then I partitioned my hard drive and I installed the Pear.  Finally the last operating system that I wanted to install was Windows 8, so I did so.  However now that I installed the Windows 8 there is no grub screen or any boot screen it just goes straight to Windows 8.  Is there a way to somehow fix this... because it's like I don't have any other operating systems on my computer now... I'm not sure what to do. \n\nA: I recently re-installed window, subsequently left with no grub menu. Here is how to reinstall grub from a live-disk.\nPart One:\nFirst\nLogin using a LiveDVD (or USB) of Ubuntu and open a terminal to type the following command to list your partitions . . .\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nThis assumes Ubuntu is on your first hard drive \"sda\" of course it may be \"sdb\" or something else.\nHere is an example of the output . . .\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1       13206     6655792+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda2           13207      232581   110565000    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5          228706      232484     1904616   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda6           13207      228705   108611464+  83  Linux\n\nNext,\nWe need to mount /dev/sda6, the Ubuntu partition. Remember, your partition number very likely may not be sda6 so change the number appropriately . . .\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt\n\nNow we need to install the Grub2 bootloader to the MBR . . .\nNOTE: it is IMPORTANT that you do not enter the partition number here.\nOnly enter the letter of the partition. Here we are using the first hard disk . . . sda.\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\n\nThe successful output should report no errors.\nPart Two:\nContinue using the same live disk session for the following.\nIt is now necessary to chroot into your Ubuntu installation in order to run update-grub.\nRun each of these commands one by one; again, replacing sda6 with the partition number of your Ubuntu installation . . .\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /\n\nsudo chroot /\n\nsudo update-grub\n\nThe output should list each of your operating systems or at least your ubuntu installation.\nReboot, and remember to remove your usb device or live cd before logging back in.\nIf windows is not listed, you can run sudo update-grub again from Ubuntu after you reboot.\n\nA: *\n\n*Start live boot with ubuntu 14.04 (select Try ubuntu option)\n\n*Open terminal command using\nCtrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type follow command and press Enter\nsudo apt-get install grub2 grub-pc\nthen run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot your computer and remove Ubuntu live boot device (ex: DVD or\nUSB drive).\nEnjoy.\n", "Q: How can I safety install Ubuntu alongside Windows without automatically creating a swap partition? I want to use a swap file instead of partition.\nI don't have any experience in using partition manager.\nI don't want to lose my current data on disk.\nI tried Wubi before and got a bad experience.\n\nA: If you don't want to use swap partition, just don't create it during installation. Choose manual partitioning in Ubuntu installer, create partition for / file system with ext4 and that's it. Ubuntu will run without swap partition, and you can add swap file then.\nYou can create a swap file of two gigabytes by doing the following commands:\n$ sudo fallocate -l 2048M /myswap\n$ sudo chmod 600 /myswap\n$ sudo mkswap /myswap\n$ sudo swapon /myswap\nAdd swap entry to /etc/fstab file:\n/myswap none swap defaults 0 0\nNow you have swap as file /myswap instead of traditional swap partition.\n", "Q: System wide Proxy settings when on a windows network with a password I'm using Ubuntu on a windows network. I want to connect to the world wide web. \nI have followed the steps here which I have found very useful.\nHowever when I try to ping a website (eg: ping www.wikipedia.org) I get no reply. \nI can ping local computers on my network, but I need to go through our proxy to get to the world wide web. \nI can even browse wikipedia using firefox, I just needed to enter the proxy configuration script location and my username and password. \nI'm quite sure the reason I'm having this trouble is because I havn't entered a username and password. I'm not sure how to do this on a system wide level. \nultimately I would like to be able to use package managers like synaptic but first I need them to be able to connect to the internet.  \nEDIT \nAs sugested I created a /etc/apt/apt.conf file like\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://chrisav:password@myproxy.com.au:8080\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"https://chrisav:password@myproxy.com.au:8080\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"ftp://chrisav:password@myproxy.com.au:8080\";\nAcquire::socks::Proxy \"socks://chrisav:password@myproxy.com.au:8080\";\n\nHowever I still cant ping wikipedia\nwhen I try installing stuff I get\nchris@chris-Ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install kate\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nE: Unable to locate package kate\n\n\nA: First of all, if you are behind a Web Proxy to go to the Internet, you cannot use ping to test the connection to Internet.\nThis is because ping is not able to use any proxy to do its work, it is using its own protocol : ICMP to send and receive packet. Web proxies works only for the TCP protocol.\nSo if you are able to open any web site in your web browser, then you can be sure that your connection to Internet is working, no reason to do ping to double-check that.\nNow regarding your problem with the package manager, if you go to System Settings -> Network, you can there define a Web Proxy configuration and apply it system-wide.\nWhen I do so on my laptop, I'm able to use apt-get without manually configuring Proxy directives into its configuration files.\nTo work, you have to open your terminal after having clicked the Apply system-wide button. (Setting cannot be applied to already running program, only to those starting after you apply the settings).\nUPD: More about Proxies and authentication\nAnother source of problem, as you are in Windows environment, may be the authentication mechanisms used on your web proxy.\nIf this proxy is configured to use NTLM, it is possible that some application cannot authentify to it.\nIn this case, what you can do is to install a local proxy supporting NTLM like cntlm, running it on 127.0.0.1 is enough and pointing it to your real Web Proxy. Then just use this local proxy as default proxy for your Ubuntu system.\n\nA: Use this command and see if your Proxy setting is correct.\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\nIt contains following content :\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://username:password@proxy-address:port/\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"https://username:password@proxy-address:port/\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"ftp://username:password@proxy-address:port/\";\nAcquire::socks::Proxy \"socks://username:password@proxy-address:port/\";\n\nYou must input your username password proxy-address and port instead of these id\n\nA: You will need to modify your /etc/apt/apt.conf file correctly as follows:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://username:password@proxy-address:port\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"https://username:password@proxy-address:port\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"ftp://username:password@proxy-address:port\";\nAcquire::socks::Proxy \"socks://username:password@proxy-address:port\";\n\nNote the :: in place of : before Proxy, replacing username, password,proxy-addressandproxy` with the ones applicable to you.\nAlso, do note that, if you have special characters like @, you will need to replace them with their respective HTML codes.\nAnd after you have done this, and if you have never updated your system, you will need to do:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand then you will be able to install packages.\nIf this doesn't help, open your /etc/environment file (using gksudo gedit /etc/environment) and then type the following:\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxy-address:port\"\nexport https_proxy=\"https://username:password@proxy-address:port\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://username:password@proxy-address:port\"\nexport socks_proxy=\"socks://username:password@proxy-address:port\"\n\nAnd then do source /etc/environment and then try again.\n", "Q: how to keep more than 2 log files? In search of occasional boot problems, I would like to keep in the log files more than 2 ones that are kept now. For example, in /var/log, I have Xorg.0.log and Xorg.0.log.old that are created by two boot ups and I need to keep track of for example last 10 log files. Similar for other main log files like dmesg (now it is dmesg and dmesg.0).\n\nA: The following script will copy a defined logfile (source) up to a number you can define (max_number, up to 99 as the script is now) into a directory you can set (dest). The log files will be named \"01logfilename\", 02logfilename etc, up to the number you define.\nIf the max number of copies is reached, the script will always keep the last (defined) number of logs, renaming the files each time the script is run. \nYou can run the script by adding it to your startup applications (Dash > Startup Applications). Note that you need to have sufficient permissions on the destination if you run it on login.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nsource = \"/path/to/logfile\"\ndest = \"/path/to/destination/to_keep_the_logs\"\nmax_number = 10 # set number up to 99\n\nfiles_indest = [i for i in sorted(os.listdir(dest)) if not i.endswith(\"~\")]\nsections = [(item[:3], item[3:]) for item in files_indest]\nnumber_oflogs = len(files_indest)\n\ndef convert_figures(number):\n    if len(str(number)) < 2:\n        return \"0\"+str(number)\n    else:\n        return str(number)\n\ndef lognumbers():\n    return [convert_figures(number+1) for number in range(0, number_oflogs+1)]\n\nlognumbers = lognumbers()\n\nif number_oflogs >= max_number:\n    os.remove(dest+\"/\"+files_indest[0])\n    for index in range(1, number_oflogs):\n        shutil.move(dest+\"/\"+files_indest[index],\n        dest+\"/\"+lognumbers[index-1]+files_indest[index][2:])\n    shutil.copyfile(source, dest+\"/\"+lognumbers[-2]+source.split(\"/\")[-1])\nelse:\n    shutil.copyfile(source, dest+\"/\"+lognumbers[-1]+source.split(\"/\")[-1])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script and paste into an empty textfile, safe it as\nlogscript.py\n\n*Set the source (log) file after source (e.g. source = \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\")\n\n*Set the destination folder, to keep the log files, after dest \n\n*Set the max number of logfiles to keep\n\n*Add the following command to your Startup Applications: python3 /path/to/script/script.py\nNo need to say that if you want / need to run the script before login, you need to start it on another level.\n\nA: Ubuntu runs logrotate in a cron job which takes care of /var/log.\nSeems they profile it for desktop vs server ( server keeps the last 8 logs of everything if  I recall).\nHere's the man to that..\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/man8/logrotate.8.html\n", "Q: Why are ImageMagick and Shotwell both pre-installed? Their jobs are pretty much the same right? I want to uninstall useless programs. But I fear I may lose important things. I have GIMP and Inkscape installed though.\n\nA: \nTheir jobs are pretty much the same right?\n\nShotwell is an organizing tool for photo's. Imagemagick lets you manipulate images I dare you to use shotwell on commandline to convert an image from a GIF to a PNG ;-)\nFrom the Ubuntu apps directory: \nShotwell is a digital photo organizer designed for the GNOME desktop environment. It allows you to import photos from disk or camera, organize them in various ways, view them in full-window or fullscreen mode, and export them to share with others. It is able to manage a lot of different image formats, also including raw CR2 files.\nImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves. All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through an X11 graphical interface (display).\n", "Q: How to install new Intel Ethernet driver Ubuntu 12.04 x64 doesn't recognize newest Intel Ethernet adapter on my desktop (Intel Ethernet Connection i217-V).

It is better to have two separate drives, especially for dual boot system. Now, I will have one SSD and one HDD in my laptop. Which is better?\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Linux and windows in SSD (partitioned) then data drive for HDD or...\n\n*Install ubuntu in SSD. Install windows in HD, partitioned with data.\n\n\nand why?\n\nA: Well I would actually install and dual boot both off your SSD and use your HDD for storage.\nReason? SSD is much faster, and you will notice the difference when your OS is on it.\nUsing two hard drives, one OS each may be a little easier to do, but I would recommend your first option for performance reasons.\n\nA: If the SSD is 64GB or larger I would install both OSs on it. During the Ubuntu install on the partitioning page you can use the other option to set up the HD as your home folder. Make sure to format it as FAT32 or NTFS (depending on whether your version of Ubuntu supports writing to NTFS) so that Windows can read it. Both OSs will benefit from the speed increase of the SSD and the space of the HD and your files will be available to both OSs.\nI can confirm that this works in 12.04, but when I tried it the mount settings were executable for all files, which means that you will need to change the default mount options.\n", "Q: How to change key binding for Tmux I want to change the key binding in Tmux so I can use \nCtrl + Alt\ninstead of \nCtrl + B\nThis is my (unfortunately) not working try to do so.\nunbind C-b\nset -g prefix M-C\n\nWhat's wrong with this? I thought I followed the documentation for the keys.\n\nA: You do indeed have the correct syntax for changing the command prefix in tmux. But unfortunately you cannot use the combination Ctrl+Alt as a command prefix. Both Ctrl and Alt are only used in combination with other keys, but never alone and never with each other. For example,\n\n\n*\n\n*C-b stands for Ctrl+B\n\n*M-n stands for Alt+N\nYour attempt to bind M-C actually means Alt+Shift+C (meta prefix with uppercase C). Similarly, C-M would mean Ctrl+Shift+M.\nIn short, you have to combine Ctrl with some other key or Alt with some other key, not with each other.\n", "Q: Unable to remove a file which has a name like a command argument I inadvertently created a file called -r in my home directory.

Move everything to a different directory (this will fail for the -r file for the same reason as rm does) and then delete the original directory (which will remove the file) and move everything back again. So, assuming your -r file is in ~/foo:\n$ mkdir ~/bar\n$ for f in *; do mv \"$f\" ../bar/; done\nmv: invalid option -- 'r'\nTry 'mv --help' for more information.\n$ rm -rf ~/foo\n$ mkdir ~/foo && cd ~/foo\n$ mv ~/bar/* .\n$ rmdir ~/bar\n\n\nA: In this case you have to use the double-dash (--) in your command arguments.\nThe purpose of it is to tell to the command that what's follow has not to be taken as an argument to the command but a simple input.

Then I installed Windows7 on the new partition. Now I cannot find the Ubuntu OS. I expected at startup to be given the option of running either Ubuntu or Windows7 but I found that Windows just runs by default. Any suggestions on what I can do to resurrect the Ubuntu?\n\nA: You need to recover your GRUB, Windows overrides the bootloader when you install it after Ubuntu. You can find a Tutorial here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: I think this is what you want:\nEasyBCD\nThat will allow you to modify your boot loader to accommodate Ubuntu.\nI prefer grub2 ;) \nAlso, I've never used this, so that's as far as I can take you, but a lot of people use this and will probably suggest the same.\n\nA: I think repairing the system by a live media is much better than to reinstall the whole system, and windows works on NTFS it cannot Detect ext4 or any other format, so you will never see Ubuntu partition on your computer but if you see memory blocks by memory management option you will see partitions \n", "Q: Putty highlighting copying I currently use Putty at my work and I am always fascinating by how useful the highlight copying tool is.

I VNC in remotely and it's a major pain if it doesn't boot to at least the point where VNC loads.

I have been noticing all this time from my cpu usage monitor that there is high usage of my CPU (without using something really intensive) and it leads to overheating.\nI checked from the system monitor, and at first it seemed like my graphics card was the problem (AMD Radeon 7670M - hybrid graphics with Intel HD 4000). Anyway, I installed fglrx-updates (the only one that actually kind of fixed the overheating problem - fglrx and xorg didn't help) and things ran a bit smoother.\nI also installed intel p-state and thermald. Put it on powersave governor, but still no luck. Also installed tlp (no conflict between them).\nTried to see if the fault is from compiz or adobe-flash. No luck. Also, HTML5 uses a LOT of CPU after a bit and it lags everything on my comp.\nAfter doing all of those, I was looking at the results from the $top command and the culprit seems to be kidle_inject. It uses like 50% of the cpu everytime. I couldn't help but notice that it seemed like it had four modules - kidle_inject/0 to kidle_inject/3.\nSo, what is this kidle_inject? I haven't been able to find something conclusive on the subject. It seems to be on when I use something that is resource intensive and it continues hogging my cpu for a minute or two after terminating usage.\nHow can I fix this so that my comp is usable at last? I am talking about a minimum temperature of 70C in low-performance use. I am heavily dependent on linux and I would like to keep using ubuntu (since I am used so much to it and I have grown fond of it).\n-- I have to say that this is not my machine's fault. When it runs on Windows 7 it's running fantastic with low temperatures.\n\nA: If you take a look at the temperature and trip points in \n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp\n\nand \n/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/trip_point_0_temp\n\nyou may find (as I did and then found myself at this question), that your system is running so hot that it is managing temperature by injecting idle cycles as @elder-geek mentioned.\nIn my case it's the hottest day of the year so far and my fan has failed, but my laptop is surviving thanks to this feature.\n\nA: The powerclamp driver is registered to the generic thermal layer as a\ncooling device. Currently, it’s not bound to any thermal zones.\nHere's an example from one of my systems.\ngrep . /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device*/type\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/type:Fan\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device10/type:LCD\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device1/type:Fan\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device2/type:Fan\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device3/type:Fan\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device4/type:Fan\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device5/type:Processor\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device6/type:Processor\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device7/type:Processor\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device8/type:Processor\n/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device9/type:intel_powerclamp\n\nExample usage:\n- To inject 25% idle time:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 25 > /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device9/cur_state\nsource:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/thermal/intel_powerclamp.txt\n\nA: Because you enabled Intel P-state (through intel_pstate=enable in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT), you've also enabled the powerclamp driver. The powerclamp driver is working to try to keep the processor at a low-power state, so that power consumption is reduced, and not as much cooling is required.\nTo do this, it forces each thread on the CPU to be idle for some amount of time by injecting idle time. Typically, this amount is 50%. The 50% you see for each of the kidle_inject processes isn't actually causing the CPU to do work; rather, it's telling the CPU not to do work, thus reducing power consumption. Note that the overall CPU usage does not include kidle-inject.\nAs @ElderGeek noted, you can tell the driver to inject a less amount of idle time. However, I tried this, and was unsuccessful. It may be that the kernel doesn't support it yet; it may be that powerclamp is ignoring the request.\n\nA: I think there must be some kind of bug here, since on my system, kidle_inject injects 50% in all CPUs, so that when I run a single threaded process, it only gets the remaining 50% of the CPU it runs on.  rmmod intel_powerclamp fixes this.\n", "Q: Terminal's \"Use custom default terminal size\" property does not work I'm trying to make custom property for terminal size. My changes has no effect and Terminal still starts in full screen mode. \n\nA: Your terminal starts in fullscreen mode because you set a size bigger than your current display.\nRemember that the size here is not given in pixels but in characters.\nThe default size is 80x24, so if you tried to set up a 1920x1200 terminal this way you'll always get a fullscreen terminal window.\nI'd suggest lower values to solve your problem, try first with 80x48 and slowly increase to see what fits your needs.\n", "Q: Routing table incorrect at startup Whenever I reboot my Ubuntu server, the routing table is incorrect for the default route.

For those familiar with building Vim from source, this requires at least the normal feature set or higher.\nThe default Ubuntu desktop installation only includes the vim-tiny  package, which is Vim compiled with almost all optional features disabled. This variant of Vim provides enough to run vi with all of the basic functionality of a vi-compatible editor, but none of the power of Vim. Since it does not have Vim scripting support enabled, it cannot work with the vimtutor command. You should install one of the more capable Vim variant packages instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*vim \n\n*vim-athena \n\n*vim-gnome \n\n*vim-gtk \n\n*vim-nox \nAny one of these packages provide a Vim that is capable of running vimtutor. For more about the differences between these Vim variants, see the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between the different vim packages available in Ubuntu\n\n*What features does vim-tiny have?\n\n*Difference between vim-gtk and vim-gnome\n\n*Which vim version can I use?\n", "Q: How can I stop YaCy from starting when my machine starts? I have installed the YaCy P2P search engine following these instructions (adding the YaCy repo to my sources and installing from there): http://www.yacy-websuche.de/wiki/index.php/En:DebianInstall\nThat page includes instructions on starting/stopping the YaCy daemon:\nsudo /etc/init.d/yacy stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/yacy start\nsudo /etc/init.d/yacy restart\n\nI can stop YaCy right now, but it starts again the next time I boot up. How can I stop it doing that, and only start when I tell it to (with sudo /etc/init.d/yacy start)?\nThis Upstart technique to permanently disable a service (accepted answer at How to enable or disable services?) does not work (YaCy still starts next time I boot):\nsudo sh -c \"echo 'manual' > /etc/init/yacy.override\"\n#doesn't work\n\n\nA: From all the general answers on disabling a service, this \"traditional\" technique is the one that works with YaCy (it is not an Upstart service, so that technique doesn't work):\nsudo update-rc.d yacy disable\nsudo service yacy stop\n\nThis will stop YaCy and prevent it from starting on the next bootup. You can start it again at any time by running:\nsudo service yacy start\n#or sudo /etc/init.d/yacy start as in the original instructions\n\nIf you prefer using a GUI, I saw that the yacy service did appear in BootUp Manager (I didn't test disabling from there, but since it's using a well-established control technique, I assume it will work).

Sometimes it does not seem possible, if the key combination is already used by Unity.\nFor example, I want to set Super+a to switch to the window demanding attention. I set it in CCSM -▸ Extra WM Actions -▸ Activate Demanding Attention Window, but when I press it, the launcher opens in Application mode instead. Same thing with Super+f, it opens the Launcher in File mode instead of going fullscreen as I defined in Compiz.\nI have read this article: Can I define keyboard shortcuts using the Super key? but there is no \"Key to show the launcher\" in 14.04, only a \"Key to show the HUD when tapped\", which I have already disabled. It shows up in the All settings -▸ Keyboard as well, also disabled. As I understand, the HUD is not the same as the launcher anyway.\nIdeally I would like to keep the Super behavior (opening launcher) when pressed alone, but still have the ability to define my own Super+key combinations. I also want to keep Super+digit.\n\nA: The workaround I found is to disable the lens functionalities.\nAll the shortcuts I want to use are taken by lens shortcuts (Super+a for applications, Super+f for files), thus making them unusable for other functionality\nI never use lenses anyway, and removing them frees the shortcuts:\n$ dconf write /com/canonical/unity/dash/scopes \"['home.scope']\"\n\nYou can do this (and remove only some of the scopes/lenses if you wish) with dconf-editor, as per this and this posts.\n\nA: I set my own Super/Win+SigleKey in \"System settings/Keyboard/Shorcuts\": \nClick the + on bottom to add your own shortcuts, eg mine are Super+C for calculator, Super+T ro run gnome-terminal, Super+Shift+T to run root terminal, Super+D to show desktop ... damned, doesn't work anymore and no option... ok found one in \"unity-tweak-tool -▸ Window manager -▸ General: Keyboard shortcuts\" but it doesn't work.\n\nEDIT: I found in \"unity-tweak-tool -▸ Launcher -▸ Additional: Keyboard shortcuts\" what you search.

I recently discovered Glade which is a hassle-free way of making a GUI for your programs. I used glade to make the program the way i wanted it to look, and now I would like to look at it's code, but I have no idea how to. Some help would be appreciated, thanks Ubuntu :)\n\nA: It is possible to build GUI dynamically from Glade file using PyGTK Gtk.Builder class\n\nThe Gtk.Builder class offers you the opportunity to design user interfaces without writing a single line of code. This is possible through describing the interface by a XML file and then loading the XML description at runtime and create the objects automatically, which the Builder class does for you. For the purpose of not needing to write the XML manually the Glade application lets you create the user interface in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) manner\n\nSee this is a nice tutorial: Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial: 20. Glade and Gtk.Builder\nExample:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass Handler:\n    def onDeleteWindow(self, *args):\n        Gtk.main_quit(*args)\n\n    def onButtonPressed(self, button):\n        print(\"Hello World!\")\n\nbuilder = Gtk.Builder()\nbuilder.add_from_file(\"builder_example.glade\")\nbuilder.connect_signals(Handler())\n\nwindow = builder.get_object(\"window1\")\nwindow.show_all()\n\nGtk.main()\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to download linux applications from other computers?

I'm new to linux and I don't know how to install redshift 1.9.1, configure the color temperature and make it automatically start. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: Simply use apt\nsudo apt-get install redshift\n\nThen you can get a widget for controlling it. For example, I used the Discover(Or Software Center in Ubuntu) app in KDE Kubuntu for installing the redshift control widget.\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 19.10, you need no redshift any more, there is a feature built in called \"Night Light\"\n(Open display settings and select the Night Light tab at the top to turn it on)\nIt is not exactly like redshift, but quite similar.\n\nA: Firstly, you need to download redshift from the git link provided and extract it. Then look on the HACKING file. It has the instructions you need to install it from source. \nI quote it here for easier access:\n\nBuild from repository\n$ ./bootstrap\n  $ ./configure\nThe bootstrap script will use autotools to set up the build\n  environment and create the configure script.\nUse ./configure --help' for options. Use--prefix' to make an\n  install in your home directory. This is necessary to test python\n  scripts. The systemd user unit directory should be set to avoid\n  writing to the system location.\nSystemd will look for the unit files in ~/.config/systemd/user so\n  this directory can be used as a target if the unit files will be used.\n  Otherwise the location can be set to no to disable the systemd\n  files.\nExample:\n$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/redshift/root \\\n  --with-systemduserunitdir=$HOME/.config/systemd/user\nNow, build the files:\n$ make\nThe main redshift program can be run at this point. To install to the\n  prefix directory run:\n$ make install\nYou can now run the python script. Example:\n$ $HOME/redshift/root/bin/redshift-gtk\nDepenencies\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*autotools, gettext\n  \n*libdrm (Optional, for DRM support)\n  \n*libxcb, libxcb-randr (Optional, for RandR support)\n  \n*libX11, libXxf86vm (Optional, for VidMode support)\n  \n*geoclue (Optional, for geoclue support)\n  \n  \n  Notes\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*verbose flag is (currently) only held in redshift.c; thus, write all   verbose messages there.\n  \n\nHopefully after some minutes you will have it set it up.\nNow, you want to configure it to your liking.\nI haven't hacked around with advanced configs since I am pretty happy with the default setting. There are two ways to set up your variables. First, you can pass them when you start redshift (e.g. redshift -l 55.7:12.6 -t 5700:3600) or you can make a config file with all your settings if its too complicated (on ~/.config/redshift.conf). The most important setting is your location which is the -l variable above. Find your latitude on google and pass it there. The -t is about the color temperature at day and night. There are a lot more options which you can find with man redshift. After you find the desired options you just put it on the start up programs with the command e.g. redshift -l 55.7:12.6 -t 5700:3600.\nYou can find more info on the redshift site: http://jonls.dk/redshift/\n\nA: Nowadays, as of 14.04 --  redshift is in the repos by default: \nsudo apt-get install redshift redshift-gtk\n\n\nA: Finally, it works, thanks to user2832080. This is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install randr dependency. \n$ sudo apt-get install libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libx11-dev\n\n\n*Download redshift 1.9.1 and extract it.\n\n*change to redshift 1.9.1 directory and type:\n$ ./configure --enable-randr --enable-gui --enable-ubuntu \\\n--with-systemduserunitdir=$HOME/.config/systemd/user\n\n\n*$ make\n\n*$ sudo make install\n\n*create redshift.conf at ~/.config, see this link.\n\n*go to /usr/local/bin and run redshift-gtk.\n\n*turn on autostart.\n\n", "Q: Mobile Broadband is not working This seems to be a huge problem!

It goes like this:\nhttps://[username]:[password]@dyndns.myisp.com/nic/update?hostname=[host]&myip=[ip] \n\nNow here is my problem: I don't know how to make my server \"use\" this http command to change the IP. I mean I know about cronjobs and how to make a simple bash script but I don't know what command to use to make my machine \"visit\" this page. \n\nA: Usually a server does just that, it serves, assuming you are talking about an HTTP server.\nIn most cases the router - DSL modem is responsible for doing such things. Check the following which may apply to your situation:\nTypical home users acquire dynamic IP addresses from their ISPs almost each time they connect to the internet or when their lease ends.\nWhen such user want to host a home server available to internet must choose between two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pay for a static IP\n\n*Find a Dynamic DNS service\n\n\nWhile using the second solution, the following things apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user keeps the dynamic nature of the IPs\n\n*The user informs the Dynamic DNS service each time a new dynamic IP has been assigned to him.\n\n*The Dynamic DNS service maps the user's IP to a URL.\n\n\nThe second part of the process above usually is done either by the ueser' router - DSL modem or by a daemon (service) application running in user's computer - server. The service logs in to the Dynamic DNS provider and informs the provider about the user's current IP address.\nTo complete the above task, first look in your router - DSM modem settings which is the most clean and simple method. If the modem does not support this feature, refer to the ISP if they provide an application for the task. Lastly run a script in the server each time a new IP is been acquired or every n minutes (typically not less than 10 minutes).\nExamples of various methods to report to Dynamic DNS Service that a new IP has been acquired:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update client application example\n\n*DSL Modem setup\n\n*Shell Script as bellow, taken from http://www.changeip.com/accounts/downloads.php\n#!/bin/bash\n#################################################################\n## ChangeIP.com bash update script                             ##\n#################################################################\n## Written 3/18/09 by Tom Rinker, released to the Public Domain##\n#################################################################\n## This is a simple bash script to preform a dDNS update with  ##\n## ChangeIP.com.

That worked fine. Now installed Ubuntu 14.04 and apart from the first successful boot, every other attempt to go to Ubuntu takes me straight in windows 8. I did some research online and i found out that i had to disable secure boot in UEFI mode. But When I go into BIOS, i don't see anything like UEFI of secure boot anywhere. I would appreciate any help on this issue please.\nThanks in advance.\nYes! both headings are there. Security and Boot. under Security I have the following: \nSet Supervisor Password, Set User Password, Set HDD Password and Password on Boot. Under Boot, I have IDE0:, CD/DVD, Network Boot, USB HDD, USB FDD and USB CD/DVD. All the above are under a broad caption Boot priority order.\nAnd no! Booting does't take me to GRUB first. it takes me straight to Windows 8.\nThanks.\n\nA: If it is an American Megatrends \"Aptio\" as found on Asus computers Legacy mode [BIOS] is called \"Compatibility Support Module\" or \"CSM\". Gives you an idea of how far out the name for UEFI, EFI, or secure boot could be.\nI found this in a document I am using for my install. It is found at \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI, \n[Unfortunately ubuntu.com does not have a link on the home page to the documentation site that I could find, so be sure to type in the \"help.\" before the ubuntu.com. There is much more in the document that might help. Also the category \"BootAndPartition\" contains other pages of interest and is found at:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CategoryBootAndPartition\nIf you have not disabled BIOS Fast Boot, disable it. Enabled it bypasses the UEFI boot choice screen on my HP110-22z. Then try a re-boot.  \nThe AMI bios version 80.1 [on a HP110-220z installed 4/19/2014] has a tab titled Security in the top menu. Fast Boot and Legacy support settings are also found there. \nIn your case tabs titled Advanced or Power on may hold it. Leave no sub, sub menu unread.\nIf still no success find the name, version and date of the BIOS on your machine, as would help others here answer your question. \nIf it is not provided in About then a utility like Speccy will list it.\nTry searching for the bios name or manufacturer on the web. A specification sheet could settle whether the option exists, what different name the BIOS maker uses for it, and where to find it if it does exist.\n", "Q: Overheating in an dual-boot system (windows 8+Ubuntu 14.04) Precisely, I would like to know if booting windows 8 through GRUB can affect in any way the global performance (CPU/GPU benchmarks, cooling efficiency etc...) in both Windows and Ubuntu 14.04 ...\nI have noticed a huge performance drop in both OS since installing Ubuntu in dual boot mode (I had previously tested both Os separately on the same machine). Even in high Temp (+99°C) the fans don't seem to speed up (thus I don't think it's a hardware issue)\nI'm using an Acer Aspire 5755G with legacy BIOS. I suspect GRUB since I have overridden acpi_os=default to acpi_os=linux, which got the backlight running.\n\nA: DO NOT LEAVE GRUB OPEN! IT MIGHT CERTAINLY CAUSE MAJOR COMPONENT DAMAGE! IF YOU ARE ALTERING A GRUB BOOT COMMAND, BE PREPARED TO COMPLETELY FINISH THE ALTERATION AND BOOT BEFORE STOPPING; IF YOU ARE INTERRUPTED, TURN OFF THE COMPUTER IMMEDIATELY BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE POWER BUTTON! \nFigure out what you want to do in grub before you use it, just to be safe. This danger is caused by a poll loop.\nAn advanced understanding would be required to fix this: it is not editing TIMEOUT because that only works prior to user input: according to GRUB support, there is no current working method to fix this.\n\nA: GRUB Has NOTHING to do with Overheating/Performance, GRUB Just Boot's up the Partition and Blows away, it's execution time Counted in seconds.\nAbout the FAN Speed, Check BIOS Settings they might be reset which what happened to me at a time for unknown Reason, Also Try Restoring Defaults for BIOS.\nOtherwise Check Your Drivers and make sure they are properly Installed and Up-To Date\n", "Q: Cannot install any package via apt-get So my problem is quite easy to describe: I can't install anything in my Ubuntu installation. apt-get stopped working after I tried to fix some other package errors I was getting. Now I'm nowhere.\nLet me try to explain how I ended up in this situation...\nI was trying to install maven2. I did sudo apt-get install maven2 and it didn't work. It told me that git-core is missing a new line in the end. So what I did was look up this error and try to fix it. I ended up finding a Python script which would add new lines to files in /var/lib/dpkg/info. This is when everything got worse... Nothing would work anymore and the errors are even more!\nThis is that Python script:\nimport os\n\ndpkg_path = '/var/lib/dpkg/info/'\npaths = os.listdir(dpkg_path)\nfor path in paths:\n    path = dpkg_path + path\n    f = open(path, 'a+')\n    data = f.read()\n    if len(data) > 1 and data[-1:] != '\\n':\n        f.write('\\n')\n        print 'added newline character to:', path\n    f.close()  \n\nNow when I try to install maven via sudo apt-get install maven (I blamed maven2 for these errors, so I tried with maven only), I got the following error:\n\nFetched 49.5 MB in 2min 7s (387 kB/s):\n  error processing package dpkg (--configure):\n  ⠀package dpkg is not ready for configuration\n  cannot configure (current status `half-installed')\n  Errors were encountered while processing:\n  ⠀dpkg\n  E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nThere are some other apt-get commands which I can't currently recall that outputted even more longer errors. I'll update this question if I encounter them again.\nWhat do I do to fix this?\n\nEdit\nI did what I was asked in the comments section (trying to install maven and then run sudo apt-get install -f and this is the whole output in the terminal:\nbash: /etc/bash_completion.d/git: No such file or directory\ndugi@Dugi:~$ sudo apt-get install maven\n[sudo] password for dugi: \nReading package lists...

My question is, how can I make it so a raw_input asks me a question that defines a variable (in this case variable is flub), then changes the code so that the variable is always the same. When I change the flub variable in the program, I would like it to always remember what I changed the variable to.\nNote: this code is just an example, I am really working with an advanced program with a graphical interface, and I didn't want to post it here on the ubuntu fourms. If you have any questions, please ask. \nThanks ubuntu :)\n\nA: I think\n\n    flub = raw_input('Where would you like your save directory to be?')\n    print flub\n\nWill get your variable, pass that to your GUI.\nUnless you change it later on in the program, it will remain until restarted / retriggered. To store that value permanently, you would need to write it somewhere lets say a text file, or set your program up to set a true false checking whether that variable has been set yet.\n", "Q: How to reverse engineer deb file?

I am writing a program where basically you type information, and the information is saved in a text file. The program has to know where to save that specific text file. I have added a menu button that directs you to an area of the program where you can tell the program where you would like the program to save the file. The problem is that I would like to have to tell the program where I would like to save the file once, and only once.

I set him up in Samba and as a system user.  I shared a couple of folders but that user cannot access them.

If someone adds a file or directory, I still want him to automatically be able to read it.\n\nA: For the lazy, there's system-config-samba in the repository ( requires X though) through which you can configure your samba server a la windows point and click way.\nSamba user by default are separate from linux users, unless you configure samba to use /etc/passwd for user management, and in which case your samba server will forward the underlying permissions.\nOr you could let samba do its own thing, in which case you would have to map the samba user(s) to one or more linux user(s) and samba will write in the file system as the linux users for you.\nEither ways, don't forget to sudo service smbd restart after you change something.\n", "Q: Can't get the shared clipboard to work on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm working on a VM that I've recently updated to the 14.04LTS. \nAlthough the Guest additions are installed, the support for both clipboard and drag and drop is set to bidirectional, when my mouse over the VM I can't see the cursor nor I can't copy and paste in both directions as expected.\nI'm using the server edition without any GUI installed. \nAny idea?\n\nA: The VirtualBox guest additions provide clipboard integration between the host and a X11 GUI running in the guest. They don't provide clipboard integration with a Linux console guest (there is a feature request for this, but it's understandably very low priority, because very few people use that feature).\nIf you want a comfortable interface inside the guest, install a GUI, for a negligible added cost in disk space. Use a lighter GUI than Gnome/Unity if you want to save RAM.\nIf you want a comfortable command line interface to the guest, use SSH in a terminal emulator of your choice running in the host. Use the console inside the guest only when you've screwed up the firewall.\n\nA: Try re installing guest additions.\nThey put some source code in /usr/src hook it up to dkms and build some kernel modules to do the magic. It happens after distupgrade that the hooks get messed up and they don't rebuild the modules from source for the new kernel major, thus you don't have the magic glue.\n", "Q: Cannot Install/Start MySQL Server Okay, I decided to migrate from MySQL Server 5.5.37 to Percona Server 5.6.

First, are you sure your home directory is under /user? The standard Linux location would be /home (although that may be different if you are in a corporate environment), so that if you are trying to save the raw file as nps in your own Downloads directory the full path and filename with extension will probably be something like /home/manu/Downloads/nps. \n[The wording of the prompt is unclear, but it appears to actually require a single contiguous target/path/to/filename.ext, not a whitespace separated list like target/path/to file ext]\nOr since you are running the ewfexport file from that directory, you can just use . to indicate the current directory i.e.\nTarget path and filename with extension or - for stdout: ./nps\nalthough personally I would probably use something like ./nps-2010-emails.raw to make the image's origin more obvious, i.e.\nTarget path and filename with extension or - for stdout: ./nps-2010-emails.raw\n", "Q: Ubuntu Has Low Volume After Start-up After booting my computer running Ubuntu 13.10, the volume always starts at around 30%.

The text that is in the file is is \"Hello World\", but the text that prints is \"['Hello World']\" How do i make it so the characters [, ], and ' do not appear.\nfile = open(\"datafile.txt\", \"r\")\nlines = file.readlines()\nSaveDir = lines\nprint SaveDir\n\n\nA: The issue is that file.readlines() returns a list of strings  - one for each line in the file - rather than a single string. The [' and '] characters are just python's way of indicating the containing list object. It doesn't know ahead of time that your file only contains a single line. \nYou can print the individual strings (in this case there is only one) by looping over the list e.g.\nfor SaveDir in lines :\n    print SaveDir\n\n\nA: You could try this python code,\nimport os\nfile = open(\"/path/datafile.txt\", \"r\")\nlines = file.readlines()\nstr = ''.join(lines)\nprint str  # => Hello World\n\n.join() function is used to convert a list into string.

Will installing Ubuntu automatically replace and remove my current OS, or will I have to do that manually?\nAnother question I have: Will I have to backup the files and programs on my computer in order to have them after I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: Downloading will not. During installation be sure to understand what you are doing and read the installation guide.\nAlthough rare, installing an OS is major surgery on your boxen.\nIf you value your data you have always have backup up, period.\n\nA: Bro, Download it, Burn to DVD, Put it in and boot it up, You'll have two Options, Try Ubuntu and Install Now \nYou Try it without Touch your HDD, or if you are planning to Install it Permanently, You will have several Options, Replace Replace Windows X with Ubuntu, and you'll also have Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows\nIf you Choose the Replace Windows Option, Everything is Wiped Permanently, However you may have a chance to recover your files using Data Recovery apps..\nAnyway, if you choose to install it alongside Windows, if Your HDD has only One Partition, You'll need to Divide a Piece of your HDD for Ubuntu, It Will offer you that With a Divider that Can Be Dragged to Specify The Size you Want\nAnd lastly then you Click Next And Then Install Now and That's all!\nOh and to Note Downloading Won't affect anything, and also Another Things to note that You Can Install Using a Flash Drive rather than a DVD, btw, it's faster, To do so use Pen Drive Linux\n\nA: It's very easy!\nYou download the Ubuntu image first, then burn the image onto DVD, then insert it in your DVD drive and reboot your computer. Just make sure you use BIOS (not UEFI firmware). After booting with DVD is completed, select \"Install Ubuntu\" instead of \"Try Ubuntu\". You will see some settings, then when the part where you worry about shows, just : \"Install Ubuntu Alongside Windows\". It's easy and whole process and after-install updates usually take about ten or twenty minutes. :)\n\nA: You can do the \"install along side windows\" as suggested in the previous post, however I advise against installing if you are unfamiliar. I would do the try ubuntu optin first, or maybe load it up I'm a virtual machine (virtualbox) first.

Even if chrome is the \"culprit\", isn't the OS responsability to stay operable under heavy load?\n\nA: Add more memory, if possible.\nGeneral information about low memory: Preventing low memory problems (windows specific, but the concepts are similar)\nThe Linux kernel provides a tweakable setting that controls how often the swap file is used, called 'Swappiness'\n", "Q: Gnome-Screenshot GUI: Which command launches that? I'm interested in setting up a keyboard shortcut that will launch the graphical user interface for Gnome Screenshot. I am however unable to find the command that launches the GUI.\nExecuting gnome-screenshot simply takes a screenshot, which is not what I am interested in.\n\nA: For other screenshot options without opening the GUI:\ngnome-screenshot -a  Grab a user selected area of the screen\ngnome-screenshot -w  Grab a window instead of the entire screen\ngnome-screenshot -c  Send screen grab directly to the clipboard\n\nFor additional options, in the terminal type your command -help \ngnome-screenshot -help\n\nA: You may look for interactive mode\nman gnome-screenshot\n\n  -i, --interactive\n          Interactively set options in a dialog.\n\n\nUse:\ngnome-screenshot -i\n\nAnyway, to get command for a GUI launcher in menu, look for its .desktop file.

Out of the box it worked first, then signal disappeared. I rebooted, signal disappeared again and did not reappear. (Also connection to monitor is no longer established).\nThen I followed these instructions: Can I force VGA signal output even when xrandr shows 'disconnected'? \nIt did not work (cannot configure CRC1). I changed HDMI cable to pricier one, no success. I searched 3 hours for solutions and did not find a particular one to be used for a newbie like me... any ideas?\n\nA: Suggest switching mini dp adapter.\nI originally tried using an Apple Brand mini dp to vga adapter without success.

You can block applications, but not websites.\nYou can access (and block, for that matter) only by the use of \"browsers.\" The one you used to post this question here, yes.\nSuppose it's Mozilla Firefox. You can look for extensions that can do the trick for you. I would not go fishing for them, but I used to have an extension that would \"blacklist\" websites so that they never open.\nIf you don't use the browser, the website won't open, you understand that, right? So, the trick lies in the browser. Please post a similar question to the support forums of the particular browser(s) you use to access the internet and want to block sites from.\n\nA: Consider taking some time to read the official documentation regarding Parental Controls at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ParentalControls as it discusses some of the options available to you.\n", "Q: How to run a program from the command line and still be able to work on the command line while it runs? Suppose that I want to run a Java program so I would type \njava myProgram\n\nand then suppose that it prints some output to the screen but takes a few hours to finish running. If I want to keep working on the same terminal while it runs, what is the command that I should use? I tried & at the end and it did not seem to work.\n\nA: Just add a & after the command. This will make the command run on the background.\nNotice that you will still get the output of it, so you may want to redirect the output to /dev/null or to some configuration file.\nE.g. in order to redirect both stdout and stderr:\njava myProgram > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\n\nA: Since the program runs a long time, you may want to consider using screen. You can run the program and then start another command prompt with Control-a Control-c. You can do that as many times as you want, and be working on several things at once. Also, even if you log out and then back in later (just don't shut down), you can reconnect to screen and see how it's doing. Do \"man screen\" for info.\nThere is also tmux, which is a similar tool, but you'll need to install it.\n\nA: I think screen will best answer your specific question, but it sounds like your workflow would benefit the most from using tabs.\nTo open a new tab in terminal, with the terminal selected you press Ctrl+T, and you can switch between tabs by pressing Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+PgDown to switch between them.\nThis quickly becomes intuitive, and ends up being efficient as you can quickly switch between tabs to check on long running programs, or quickly spawn more tabs as you busy the ones you're working in with long tasks.\n", "Q: Realtek RTL8188CE desconects randomly and features slow connections I am brand new to Ubuntu and am having internet issues, as in it disconnects about 10 to 15 minutes in and is generally very slow.

your device uses is problematic but sometimes if we add some parameters to it and change some settings in the router we can get it to work if not we will have to compile an new driver.\nFirst in your router change 802.11bgn to 802.11bg.\nSecond change the wep encryption to just wpa2 (CCMP)(AES) not (TKIP) if you have that option it will work best.\nThird set your wireless channel in the router to 1 or 11 then save the router configuration and reboot it.\nFourth go into network manager at top right corner of the screen and click on edit connections>wireless tab and set IPV6 to ignore.  \nNow

It seems the kernel developers tried to solve a RTLxxxx driver problem and as a side effect, they broke it. So I guess you have to wait, till someone fix it again. An alternative will be to downgrade to an older kernel version, like the one delivered with Ubuntu LTS 12.04.\n\nA: I installed the Ubuntu mainline 4.0 kernel on my 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 with ASUS PCE-N15and things are much better! iwconfig reports 54 Mb/s now instead of 1 Mb/s!\n", "Q: Bootup problems I have installed Refit but I could not get my mac to boot up in Ubuntu by default so i installed Grub Customizer but Grub does not load when I reboot only Refit. \nThe problem with Refit is that my wireless mac keyboard only works if i made a boot from os x if I boot from Ubuntu the keyboard does not work and then by default Refit boot into Mac OS x :-).\nIf I have used Mac OS x and then boot into Ubuntu my keyboard only workes after I have tuned it on and off under the menu in the top right corner in Ubuntu.\n\nA: First, rEFIt has been abandoned. I've picked up development and forked it as rEFInd, so you might want to try that instead; however, I've made no changes to rEFInd that would be likely to solve the problem you describe. That problem is basically one of drivers and hardware initialization by the firmware, which is inadequate to get your keyboard working from a cold boot. In theory, this problem could be solved within rEFInd, but I (or another programmer who wants to tackle it) would need access to both hardware and documentation. I lack the former, and I haven't gone looking for the latter. (UEFI documentation is copious, but trying to find documentation to solve a specific problem is very difficult because it's poorly organized and strangely unhelpful.)\nAs a workaround, I suggest you look into the default_selection option in refit.conf or refind.conf (depending on which program you're using). This option is much more flexible in rEFInd than in rEFIt, but in either program, you can use it to change the default boot loader that rEFIt/rEFInd launches.\n", "Q: Trying to update Asus BIOS My UX31 zenbook is experiencing some weird shutdown behavior when the battery drops below 50% and the internet seems to agree that updating the BIOS is a good step forward since there were issue with the kernel before.\nI downloaded both the correct BIOS file and the windows 7 utility tool and now need to boot FreeDOS to run, however, I've tried every method out there and they all fail (or so I think):\n\n\n*\n\n*Using unetbootin's FreeDOS 1.0 image I get to an error saying it couldn't run drivers then I get to a command line on disk A:. I assumed a dead end.\n\n*Using unetbootin but with the FreeDOS 1.1 version image downloaded directly: get an error of \"bad or missing command interpreter\". I looked online and the solutions didn't work either.\nSo, is there an alternative to FreeDOS or to installing a BIOS that I could use? \n\nA: Short answer: Read the manual (page A-12).\nThis product, like others, has an integrated update functionality. Put the update on a USB stick, select \"EZ Flash\" or \"Easy Flash\" from the UEFI boot menu and do the update from within this program.\n\nThis is not releated to Ubuntu, you should have asked the question on another Stack Exchange site. However:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Using unetbootin's FreeDOS 1.0 image I get to an error saying it couldn't run drivers then I get to a command line on disk A:. I assumed a dead end.\n  \n\nNo, I think that is the correct behaviour. Depending on what error messages you got (some might not be releated to the task you are trying to accomplish). You then need to run the update utility and point it to the update it should apply. The difficult part may be to find out in which drive or directory the tool and update reside.\nAlso there is the possibility that there doesn't exist a DOS-based update tool, or the tool is not compatible to FreeDOS (and earlier versions of MS DOS) and has to be run from a Win9x boot disk (I remember facing such a problem with a 2011 model ProBook and some service technician tools).\n", "Q: Newly upgraded Ubuntu 14.04 - slow?

He wants all his files and his Microsoft programs (Word, Excel) to be on the computer after Ubuntu is installed. We have moved all the files/programs to an external hard drive. This may be dumb question, but will we be able to move them to the internal hard drive? Or will they be removed?\n\nA: mmm you cant move programs and expect them to work in a totally different OS unless it is the .exe installer (still not all executable programs will install easy like in windows, many even would NOT RUN/WORK AT ALL). Now if is Office package what your dad needs then you can do that no problem, there are plenty of tutorials out there but you need to have the executable file, the cd or the .iso with the installer (Though Ubuntu comes with LIBRE OFFICE but i understand why you would keep office for your dad)\nAbout your dad's files sure can be copied back to the pc after ubuntu install, while they are all backed up in a external hdd you'll be safe. IF your dad doesn't have plenty of files like to almost fill your disk then what i would recommend is to repartition the XP pc, in the new LARGE partition (say disk D: labeled FILES) move all the files to that partition, so when your going to install Ubuntu you do it on Disk C: which contains the windows XP the the other partition \"Disk D:\" will be like if nothing happened because you didn't touch that partition and so you can share and access those files with ease.\nJust go with what it's easier for you.\n\nA: Of course Ubuntu accepts simple file transfer within drives. You have to give us more specifications of your system and HDD used.\nImportant: read these.\nIf you're on a dual boot: then you should've installed Ubuntu on a separate drive (like F drive, D drive, etc. - the Windows is automatically installed in the C drive - if you let it be intact, all information will stay as it is so that it's accessible when you boot the Windows system).\nIf you're removing Windows and then installing Ubuntu, then there's no use of those programs, as they won't be accessible.\nAs alternatives, Ubuntu comes packed with LibreOffice suite, that's pretty much same to the Microsoft Office suite and includes the rich text editor (like Word), the spreadsheet editor (like Excel), advanced paint program (like MS Paint - this one can also open files like PDFs and .cdr), presentation (like PowerPoint).\n", "Q: Ubuntu server and schooltool I want to install schooltool on a remote webserver for trying it with some colleagues and I could not find any ubuntu free web server where to install it and isntructions on how to install it on a remote web server.

So on ppc64el, you'll need to:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\nThat will get you the correct linux-image-extra-KERNEL_VERSION package.\nFrom there, the kernel module loads, but I have no experience to test it.\nIf you find bugs in the ibmvfc driver, please file them on launchpad using ubuntu-bug linux-image-generic.\n", "Q: Remove Ubuntu 14.04 bootloader entry in Windows 8.1 Bootloader EFI Entry?

While the previous models have three actual keys (left, middle, right), the new model has no key and the whole touchpad is a button.\nIn the old models you can scroll a page but holding the middle button and move the trackpoint.  Is it possible to do that on W540?\nIf not, is there anyway to enable \"one-finger scrolling\"?   That is, I want the whole touchpad to be a scrolling pad... as long as I move finger there it will scrolls.  Is that possible?\nThe system is Ubuntu 14.04.\nThanks!\n\nA: I also have a w540 with Ubuntu 14.04 installed. The default Unix behavior is he middle mouse button for pasting the contents of the clipboard.  If you want to set up scrolling check out this webpage on how to configure the trackpoint.\nYou can enable scrolling with one finger if you go to System Settings -> Mouse & Touchpad and uncheck the \"Two finger scroll\" option.  This allows you to scroll vertically with one finger on the right edge of the touchpad (as is common from earlier model touchpads).\nTwo other resources I keep handy are Debian on Thinkpad W540 (github.com), and the W540 page on ThinkWiki. \n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM) for android emulator?

A quick workaround the problem was to go with UUID instead of the DEV letter by editing the etc/rc.local file to include:\n\nhdparm -y /dev/disk/by-uuid/443AFBAD7FE50945\nhdparm -y /dev/disk/by-uuid/7ABB49654B799D40\n\nSo I thought I was in the clear, as I heard both hard drives die down during the boot sequence, BUT, as soon as I log in both drives start up again! so now I have to figure out what is making them start up again after log in, or perhaps another way to get them to turn off. Is there some kind of command i can get to execute after log in? I tried editing the startup applications to include an autossh with:\n\nautoshh - sudo hdparm -y /dev/disk/by-uuid/7ABB49654B799D40\nautoshh - sudo hdparm -y /dev/disk/by-uuid/443AFBAD7FE50945\n\nbut this did not seem to work to turn off the disks after log in.\n\nA: It looks like the disk you are trying to shut down contains an NTFS partition. Find out what is the volume label, in my example below I will use label DATA. Then you could use script like:\nfor drive_letter in {a..f} ; do \n  if [ \"`ntfslabel /dev/sd${drive_letter}1`\" == \"DATA\" ] ; then \n    sudo hdparm -y /dev/sd${drive_letter}1\n  fi\ndone \n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*for drive_letter in {a..f} ; do loops over letters a-f\n\n*if [ \"``ntfslabel /dev/sd${drive_letter}1``\" == \"DATA\" ] ; then checks the label of device /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1, etc and compares it to DATA (sorry about the double backticks)\n\n*sudo hdparm -y /dev/sd${drive_letter}1 is the payload\n\n", "Q: Third party applications on HiDPI display I noticed that some apps (Google Chrome, Viber, VKAudioSaver) have problems with HiDPI dispays (everithing is too small).

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 (64bit) and I have issues with the cooling. I know it might be a hardware issue, but I've checked, the fan is running and in my GUI I use the command \"sensors\" which shows me a RPM of 2200 and a CPU temperature of 60°C while I'm not running any software. This seems to be really mysterious. \nHowever, if I start my IDE (Eclipse), Firefox and Chromium at the same time, the CPU temp goes up to 75-90° Celsius. I doubt that this is common for a system with 16 GB RAM, an i7 Processor and an Intel water cooling system and I also never had some issues like this before when I was running Ubuntu 12.04 or 13.04.\nFan Speed\nAt 60°C it's at 1300 RPM, and after start up Eclipse and Firefox it's at approximately 2200 RPM and between 75°C - 90°C depending on how many windows and IDE's I've opened.\nIf I use the \"top\" command, there are just few processes like Xorg or Compiz which are taking up to 10% CPU usage at maximum, during the time I'm not running any software.\nI have tried to upgrade the Linux kernel, where I failed. After upgrading, I wasn't able to boot anymore so I tried to remove the new kernel from the boot directory and updated my grub file to an old entry, which works fine now, but still with the temperature issue.\nMy NVIDIA drivers is also up to date, which dropped some issues I had before with the CPU load. So it can't be a problem with the graphic card.\nHow can I find out, where the problem is, or why my CPU gets that high temperatures, which I only should get while playing games with high end graphics and so on? \nDid anyone have some similar issues before?\n\nA: Well, after updating my BIOS, installing the latest kernel headers and booting a live cd, I've figured out, that the problem was caused by something quite different. I disconnected every peripheral from my computer and booted it only connected to one monitor, instead of the three monitors I've always used. However, I had only an average temperature of 45°C and an average temperature of 55°C after connecting the second monitor.

Recently I've bought a Series 7 Ultra Samsung ultrabook and decided to change the OS from originally installed Windows 8 to Ubuntu 14.04LTS. However, it's difficult not to notice great decrease in battery life: on pre-installed Windows 8 battery would last for about 6 hours while on Ubuntu it's almost empty after 2 hours of same kind of work (wi-fi, web, vlc, spotify, intellij idea).\nI'm not here to say that Ubuntu's battery performance is worse than Windows, but to ask for suggestions how to improve the situation (2 hours of work is pretty poor battery life). \nCan you recommend some sources, applications or tips/tricks that would improve battery life on my ultrabook? I really like the Ubuntu experience, but this makes my machine much less reliable.\nI suspect that graphic video card might be one of the issues here. Let me give you tech specs of the ultrabook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: Intel® Core™ i5 Processor 3337U (1.80GHz, 3MB L3 Cache)\n\n*Chipset: Intel HM76\n\n*Graphic: AMD Radeon™ HD 8570M Graphics with 1GB gDDR3 Graphic Memory (PowerExpress) and Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000\n\n*Display: 13.3\" SuperBright+ 350nit FHD LED Display (1920 x 1080), Anti-Reflective\n\n*Memory: 10GB DDR3 System Memory at 1,600MHz\n\n*Hard-drive: 128GB Solid-state Drive\n\n\nMore informations here, on the official page. If it's helpful to provide additional info, I'm happy to do it, just let me know what you need. Thank you.\n\nA: I have almost the same machine (730U3E-S02PL, some slight differences in spec), so I can share my experiences with you. Hopefully it will help you to fix the problems with energy drain.\nThe main reason for the unnaturally high power consumption is that your discrete graphic card (Radeon) is constantly on. To switch it off, you will have to install the official AMD drivers from:\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux+x86#amd-catalyst-packages\n\nYou can try using beta drivers, but I have found them unstable, so I do not recommend them. Unpack the downloaded file and run amd-driver-installer-XXXXXX.run (with root privileges).\nAfter having installed the drivers, reboot your machine. Run the Catalyst Control Center: \nsudo amdcccle\n\nand under the \"Graphics switching\" or whatever (I've got it in Polish...), choose your Intel card. You will have to reboot your computer again. If you see a window informing you that your computer is running in low graphics mode, do not worry. Click cancel and reboot it again. If unity does not start - power your computer off (by pressing and holding the power button for a few secs) and then on again.\nPerforming these steps alone improved my battery life from like 2 hours to 4+. It also helps with the fan spinning constantly at high speed.\nNext thing you can do is to enable intel_pstate (a new power scaling driver used for modern Intel CPUs):\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nchange the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_pstate=enable\"\n\nSave the file, and run these commands:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nInstall TLP (tool for setting and managing your power-saving options):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nInstall thermald (a tool developed by Intel's Open Source Technology Center which monitors and controls the CPU temperature, preventing it from overheating):\nsudo apt-get install thermald\n\nTo be able to switch the CPU scaling driver easily, you can use the cpufreq indicator. Install it by using this command:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nYou can find more details here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/prevent-your-laptop-from-overheating.html\n\n*http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html\n", "Q: ps3 controller failed to pair I'm trying to pair my ps3 controller with trusty.

How can I get the network address from a headless Trusty VirtualBox client?\n\nA: *\n\n*Find the mac address for the newtworking interface that you want to get the address for. You can do this using ifconfig or I think its listed in the machine config for the virtual interface.\n\n*From the host (or which ever machine you are using to ssh) install arp-scan.\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan. arp-scan lists all mac and ip address pairs on the network.\n\n*Then the command to run arp-scan and grep out the mac address you want would look somehting like\nsudo arp-scan 10.253.0.0/24 | grep -i <mac address>\nYou may have to specify an interface if you have more than 1 e.g. --interface=eth0. And your network and subnet may be different. \nNow for extra credit you could use awk to pull out just the ip address and put together your ssh command, and have everything done in one little script.\nThis is what I would do.\npseudocode:\nstart vm\nsleep 1 min\nip=$(apr-scan | grep | awk print $2)\necho $ip\nssh <user>@$ip\n\n\nA: This seems to be caused by the machine starting and waiting at the GNU GRUB screen (visible in the Preview). Starting it via the GUI once (to get the login screen), stopping it, and starting it headless seems to work.\nI'm guessing it waits at GRUB after a kernel or Guest Additions update. (But I'm not sure.)\n\nA: The problem with arp approach is - you have to initialize TCP/IP or UDP communication with the box prior to find it on the system arp table.\nSo you have to know the IP ;) - chicken and egg problem.\nHowever this way should work: \nVBoxManage list runningvms \n\n\"some_box_default_1486476025646_64328\" {d20b1b0e-a5xf-4afc-94e0-4ea78d70539f}\n\nVboxManage guestproperty get {d20b1b0e-a5xf-4afc-94e0-4ea78d70539f} /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/1/V4/IP\n\nValue: 10.XX.XX.XX\n\n   Net/0  for eth0   Net1 for eth1   \n\n\nA: After searching and no good result, I found this article: https://itsfoss.com/how-to-find-what-devices-are-connected-to-network-in-ubuntu/\nin resume:\n\n\n*\n\n*use ifconfig to know your_ip\n\n*use nmap nmap -sn your_ip/24\n\n\nit show all device connected to the LAN, if there are few is easy to know your VM IP.\n", "Q: Why doesn't 'cp /user/local' work?

It's most apparent at startup but it's also noticeable when working with/on (JS, mainly) the browser (especially, Chrome but also Firefox).

If so, why?\n\n*Is there any actual difference between a clean install and an upgrade in the case of a LTS distro? If so, how would installing (lots of) new software after the system is working could affect its preformance?\n\n*How to recognise the signs showing that it might well be the time to invest on a new computer?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nNacho\nP.S. In case of carrying out a clean installation, is there any way of ending up with basically the same software base you had before?\n\nA: *\n\n*An installation should not gradually degrade, if your software is reliable (no bugs). Slow downs in my experience are generally down to issues with specific pieces of software and usually fixable without the need to reinstall.\n\n*If you do a full wipe you would get a clean new home. Pending bugs in the upgrade process you should not have any difference with installed software. You don't need to do a full wipe to clean your home out.\n\n*There are no Ubuntu specific signs. When tasks that you normally do take too long that would be acceptably faster on a newer machine.\n\n\nYou can backup the list of installed software on your machine - How to backup settings and list of installed packages has all the steps required.\n", "Q: Changing Windows dynamic disk partition to basic partition and not the full drive I have a Lenovo G505s with Win8 installed on it. I would like to install Ubuntu 14.04 on it, and I've followed all the procedures to disable the secure boot and fast boot successfully. \nThe problem starts here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the installation starts, gparted doesn't recognize the Dynamic partitions of HDD.\n\n*It shows the whole HDD as unknown.\n\n\nI want to convert my HDD dynamic partition, which I made for Ubuntu, to a Basic Partition without changing the other partitions.\nIs it possible to just change a single partition to basic from dynamic, without having to change the whole hard-disk?\n\nA: You cannot change just one partition - you have to change the whole drive. The whole drive is either a Dynamic Disk or Basic Disk.\nTo convert a Dynamic Disk to Basic you will need to use Windows. It cannot be done in Linux, because Linux can not access Dynamic Disks. See Converting dynamic to basic disk and MS Technet: Change a Dynamic Disk Back to a Basic Disk and this answer on Super User. For detailed instructions with different tools see this tutorial.\n\nA: Bain may well be correct, but the description of the Linux tool showing the disk as unpartitioned makes me think that something else may be going on. Specifically, I suspect that the disk may be using the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system, but with leftover GUID Partition Table (GPT) data from a previous setup on the disk. This type of configuration is known to give the Ubuntu installer fits. If I'm right, the solution is to clear away the old GPT data. One easy way to do this is to use FixParts, as described here.\nBefore deciding what to do, I recommend posting the output of the following command, typed at an emergency Linux boot's command prompt:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nIf it tells you that it's found both MBR and GPT data and asks which to use, then my hypothesis is correct and you should use FixParts (or some other tool) to delete the old GPT data. If it doesn't present such a question, though, it could be that something else is going on -- maybe a simple Basic/Dynamic problem that's showing unusual symptoms, or maybe something else. Also, it's entirely possible that both issues are in play -- you could have leftover GPT data and a Basic/Dynamic problem!\n\nA: From Linux you can't do this. Linux does not support dynamic disks.\nInstall Windows 8 on a 32GB or higher pendrive or external hard disk (google \"how to make live Windows USB\").\nBoot Windows 8 from your pendrive in your laptop. Connect to the internet.\nThen download AOMEI Dynamic Disk Converter Software from this link: http://www.disk-partition.com/features/convert-dynamic-disk-to-basic.html.\nThen install that software.

Many commands that support colour also have an override argument.\n\nA slightly more in-depth answer is that ls is checking whether or not its STDOUT belongs to a real terminal or not. When you pipe things around, the STDOUT is set to the STDIN of the next command. \nYou can see this at work in the ls source code. It's using the isatty command (a core POSIX interface) to work out what the situation is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are colours on by default:\n    print_with_color = (i == color_always\n                        || (i == color_if_tty\n                            && isatty (STDOUT_FILENO)));\n\n\n*Do we try to output in multiple columns:\nif (format == long_format)\n  format = (isatty (STDOUT_FILENO) ? many_per_line : one_per_line);\n\n//...\n\nif (isatty (STDOUT_FILENO))\n  {\n    format = many_per_line;\n    set_quoting_style (NULL, shell_escape_quoting_style);\n    qmark_funny_chars = true;\n  }\nelse\n  {\n    format = one_per_line;\n    qmark_funny_chars = false;\n  }\n\ngrep does a very similar thing, unless explicitly overridden, it'll detect colour support, with isatty:\ncolor_option = isatty (STDOUT_FILENO) && should_colorize ();\n\n\nA: If you're interested in colors in less more generally, you might want to look at lesspipe.sh. See, for example, https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe.\n\nlesspipe.sh is an input filter for the pager less as described in less's man page.

If you boot from a live CD, and make all the modifications on that device, it should become what you are looking for.\n", "Q: chrome memory and cpu footprint I've searched the forums for an answer but I couldn't find quite the answer I was looking for [1] , so I thought I it could as well be of interest to more people around here.\nI carry out a big part of my job on the browser (or for the browser, if you want to put it that way). I tend to use Chrome, because it's got natively many of the newest features that I need (DevTools stuff, mainly but not only). BTW, I'm usually running the last available Chrome version/build on a desktop Vaio with 4GB RAM and dual core CPU and Ubuntu 12.04 as distro and Gnome as window manager.\nSo, I was curious about a) why does Chrome spawn so many threads even opening only three of four tabs and b) is there any way to allocate more memory to Chrome to prevent its performance from degrading? \nThanks in advance,\nNacho\nPS [1] I found threads about Chrome freezing or running out of memory but not about the reasons for this being so or for avoiding it to happen.\nPPS Of course, I could always buy a newer and more capable machine and that is exactly what I'm trying to evaluate: is this a question of outdated hardware or the problem will keep appearing on any (decently but not hugely sized) machine?\n\nA: Chrome separates each major part of the browser into separate processes. For example, the browser itself is its own process, each tab is its own process, and each extension is its own process. There's also likely a separate GPU process. (You can see these details by going to about:memory).\nPart of the advantage here is the limited access each part has on the other parts. For example, if there was a malicious script in an extension or a tab, then (ideally) it could only affect its own process, and won't bring down the entire browser. If a tab gets frozen for whatever reason, only that tab (and possibly tabs you open from that tab) are brought down, but not the whole browser. (See also about:sandbox.)\nYou can't pre-allocate memory to Chrome; if Chrome needs more memory, and it is available, then it will take it. Note that the limiting condition may also be on the I/O side, as Chrome has to read your profile, preferences, and at least part of your history on startup and general use. Linux and Unix have a feature that let you store files in RAM, which will result in faster access (reading from memory is faster than reading from the hard drive, and can also reduce wear in the case of many writes), but with a potential loss in data (the contents of the RAM are lost when your computer loses power or shuts down).\nThere is a script called profile-sync-daemon which stores the browser profile and cache in RAM and syncs the profile back to the hard drive every hour. This means that if your computer were to lose power or have a hard shutdown, your profile and history will be at most one hour old. (On normal shutdown, the script syncs back the contents from memory to the hard drive.) See the link above for more installation and this page for installation in Ubuntu.\nNote that Chrome(ium) store the cache separately from your profile, and the script only takes care of the profile (it's outside the scope of the script to manage the cache). You may want to move the cache from the current location into the profile directory, and add a symlink at the old location to the new location.\n", "Q: difference between atjobs & atspool directory when i was working with ubuntu 12.04 at command i noticed that there are two different directories /var/spool/cron/atspool and /var/spool/cron/atjobs .

I have a dell laptop with 4GB of ram and 500GB of storage.I just finished installing windows 8.1 32bit version, which utilizes 3GB of ram.\nCan I install and run Ubuntu to utilize that unusable portion of Ram.Then how? \nThanks in advance\n\nA: First: 3GB is the maximum usable memory the 32-bit version can handle \nThere are exceptions, such as 32 bit Ubuntu with PAE. But in general if you have 4GB or more RAM you should use a 64 bit operating system. \nSecond: There can be only one operating system running your PC at any one time.\nThink of this as having one car and two drivers. Only one driver can drive the car at a time. You have to stop the car if you want to switch drivers. Similarly, you have to stop the PC if you want to switch between Windows and Ubuntu.\nAn Example of 1 car and 2 drivers continued\nSuppose there are two drivers A and B in a car. Driver A is driving, on a road with speed limit of 40. But driver A can only drive at 30. Driver A is like 32 bit Windows (or 32 bit (non-PAE) Ubuntu). There is unused speed of 10. The driver B, who is sitting in the same car cannot use that unused speed. You have to stop the car and let Driver B drive. When you let Driver B drive, whether she will use the full speed of 40 or not will depend on what kind of driver she is.\nIn conclusion: Can Ubuntu use all my 4GB of RAM?\nYes! All currently supported 32 bit versions of Ubuntu are PAE enabled. So irrespective of the 32 bit or 64 bit versions of Ubuntu you choose, it will support all of your 4GB RAM. See What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose? for more on which Ubuntu you should choose.\nI hope this helps\n\nA: There are a couple of questions you should know about:\n1. Can Windows and Ubuntu share resources simultaneously\nSince both operating systems work independently, they do not share any type of hardware resources since neither depends on the other one. This means that when you boot Windows, you will see how Windows handles the hardware (Including hard drive usage, motherboard usage and optimal memory usage). When you boot Ubuntu it will work with the hardware provided, independent of how Windows used it before. They do not share any hardware capabilities at this level.\n2. Can they somehow be force to share resources\nSo up to this point, you can not make them share the same hardware at the same time, only one of them can use the hardware at a time. What you could do is use virtualbox or any other virtualization technology to emulate either Ubuntu or Windows.\nIf you virtualize Ubuntu inside Windows, you will still get the 3GB memory limit for the 4 GB real memory you have. This means that Ubuntu can only work with the 3GB Windows can see, making Ubuntu depend on how Windows manages the resources.\nIf you virtualize Windows inside Ubuntu, you will be able to see the full 4GB of ram and can work with this to assign some of it to the emulated Windows environment.\n3. Can they both work in a dual boot way\nIn relation to the dual boot process, yes you can boot them in dual boot but to make it easier, take into consideration that you need to first install Windows, then follow up with Ubuntu. To make it even easier, do not use a pre-installed Windows 8. For what I can read from your question, you actually installed Windows yourself, so that makes me think (since you also have 32 bit) that you installed Windows without UEFI support. \nIf this is correct, simply insert the Live CD/USB image of Ubuntu and install it. The boot process will take care to show both systems when you reboot so you can select which one you would like to boot to. But again, remember, both systems work independent of each other, they do not share memory, cpu, motherboard, drivers or any other hardware related feature while booting from one or the other (Except of course if virtualized environments).\n4. Does 32 bit Ubuntu detect my whole 4GB of RAM in comparison to Windows 32 bit\nThere is something important everyone should know about Windows and Ubuntu. On Windows, the system allocates and reserves a specific amount of memory for System Usage or System Reserved. This can vary between 300 MB up to 1.5 GB. This means that when you check the memory available, what you will actually see is the memory you can use with any other application that is not reserved for system only. So for example, if you have 4 GB of RAM, you will only see, assuming Windows reserves 900 MB of RAM, a total of 3.1 GB of \"free available memory\". Of course you would ask what happened to the rest. The rest of the 900 MB as reserved for system use, this is a way of optimizing and prioritizing which applications and services have better speed and privileges on the system.\nWith that in mind, another topic you should know is that Windows 32 bit can only read up to 4 GB of RAM. In the case of Ubuntu, the 32 bit version can read up to 64 GB of RAM, this is because of the PAE feature. Apart from this, Ubuntu and Linux in general have a further optimized kernel that can handle much better the 4 GB limit, so it does not use, 900 MB for example, it just needs less than 200 MB (Even less in other versions and distros, getting to a point of only 1 MB or 2 MB).\nI will also include further reading that I wrote to help you along the way:\nFor better performance should I install 32-bit or 64-bit?\nDoes 32-bit PAE with more than 4GB RAM improve speed?\nDoes Ubuntu Desktop 32Bit Support more than 4GB Memory with default installation?\nWhat's the maximum amount of RAM I can use on an specific hardware\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n", "Q: Command for checking the default terminal My Situation Is:\nI am trying to make a simple IDE for NASM in Java. When I execute a .asm file in my IDE it open the terminal and shows the output. I am using xterm for this purpose. Now the problem is I really don't like the look of xterm or uxterm. I prefer the gnome-terminal. But if I use the gnome-terminal this will restrict my application to a particular OS i.e. it will be able to execute .asm files only in Ubuntu (for eg:the default terminal for KUbuntu is something else.. etc.. )\nSo my idea is that if there is a 'command' that i can run in xterm to get to know the default terminal and execute the .asm files via my application in the default terminal of the particular OS. That was my first question.\nMy second question is: Is there a way i can simply transfer the controls of a terminal to something else. Like in Java to a JTextPane. My idea is to simply create a console like in ecplipse of netbeans where you can see your output in their own console. So It will be actually better than the idea of invoking the terminal and then running the commands in it.\n\nA: x-terminal-emulator is rigged up as part of the alternatives system to call an available terminal.\nNote that this is system-wide and not a desktop-specific thing so it could mean that Gnome Terminal runs on KDE if both it and Konsole are installed... But it's close enough IMO.\nI've also found that there's a $COLORTERM environment variable defined. On this Kubuntu machine —without gnome-terminal installed— it's still set to Gnome Terminal. So perhaps not that reliable.\n\nA: You can call a terminal with \"x-terminal-emulator\" , see http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=13945\nAlternately, if you want maximal portability, write a set of tests to determine the available terminals, set a variable TERMINAL and then call TERMINAL from within your script.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 two Nvidia cards triple screen Xinerama with proprietary driver, third screen black and X cursor I am having some issues getting my third screen working properly.\nI had triple screens working fine on 12.04, using 2 nvidia cards.

The unzip program doesn't think that it's a valid zip file.\nTry opening a terminal (search for it in your programs menu). For the purposes of this demonstration, I'm going to assume it's in your downloads folder.\nOnce you've opened the terminal do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change directory to the downloads folder.\ncd ~/Downloads\n\n*Unzip the file using the command-line tool, unzip\nunzip Floating1a.zip\nThis should put it into a folder (or give you a zip-bomb in the current directory) of everything that's in it. If this fails, it is almost guaranteed to be a problem with the file, not the unzip program.\n", "Q: Xfce screen goes black after some time My Xfce goes black after some time when I'm not using computer.

Here is the simplest solution I could find:\nOpen Okular GUI. Navigate to Settings > Configure Okular. In General, under Program Features, check the 'Open new files in tabs' option. Click Apply. Click OK.\nThen on your terminal, run okular file1.pdf file2.pdf fileN.pdf.\nThat code should open all your files in the same Okular window in different tabs.  This method works across folders.\n", "Q: how to install Longene linux unified kernel? I heard that Longene Linux unified kernel (Sourceforge link) (GibHub link) will help me install windows apps and some people say it performs better than regular Wine. I need to use windows apps on my Ubuntu 13.10 . I have tried play on Linux and wine but they wont work for my needs. Please tell me how to install that Linux unified kernel \n\nA: Longene appears to be a dead project. The source code patch is dated 2006 and last download package is dated 2010. The patch is for a very old 2.6 kernel. There is no way you will be able to install Longene on a modern Ubuntu release. \n\nA: longene-1.0-rc2 has the instruction on how to build and install longene kernel module. After that, you can run Windows application on your Linux machine. But the kernel module can only be built on x86 machine, x64 is not supported yet.\n", "Q: No desktop after installing gnome shell Two days ago,I've tried to install gnome on Ubuntu 14.04 using this command:\n\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nafter that everything has been working well.But I've noticed that there is no folder in the desktop,also I cannot do \"right-clic\" on the desktop.\n\n\nA: This is happening because you (or GNOME) have disabled icons on the desktop.

If that's slower, convert it to C++ (a bit more of a PITA, which is why I'm using Python!) and that should rip through your data. It's not tough programming but it's what's required for optimal speed.\n\nA little refactoring, harder to port unless you have an equivalent to defaultdict:\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndata = defaultdict(lambda: [0,0])\nwith open(\"file\", \"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        key = line[0:20]\n        allowed = int(line[21:22] != \"A\")\n        data[key][allowed] += 1\n\nfor key, val in data.items():\n    print('%s,%d,%d' % (key, val[0], val[1]))\n\nAnd a Python implementation of a hybrid of  steeldriver's and my ideas. This is probably the most memory efficient you'll get and it's using substring comparison rather than a regex extraction so should be nippy. It required sorted input though.\nlast = \"\"\nscore = [0,0]\n\nwith open(\"file\", \"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        key = line[0:20]\n        allowed = int(line[21:22] != \"A\")\n\n        if key and key != last:\n            print '%s,%d,%d' % (last, score[0], score[1])\n            score = [0,0]\n            last = key\n\n        score[allowed] += 1\n\nprint '%s,%d,%d' % (last, score[0], score[1])\n\n\nBenchmarking\nIn the interest of getting some of this tested (for my own curiosity, as much as anything else) I decided to do a little benchmarking on a 2,400,000 record file that covers 2400 separate dates.\nI used the following Python script to generate a big file with random Allow/Deny endings:\nimport itertools, datetime, random\n\nCHOICES = ['Allow', 'Deny']\n\nwith open(\"file\", \"w\") as f:\n    for _ in itertools.repeat(None, 2400):\n        epoch = random.randint(1, 1404226041)\n        d = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(epoch)\n        print d\n        dstr = d.strftime('%b %d %Y %X')\n\n        for _ in itertools.repeat(None, 1000):\n            f.write('%s %s\\n' % (dstr, CHOICES[random.randint(0,1)]))\n\nThis was about a thousand times faster than the Bash equivalent (see the revision log) and gives us a diverse log file to play with.

You can install Ubuntu in a normal way, which is as easy as Wubi and far less trouble prone.\nThere is really nothing to worry about, just follow the Ubuntu installation help and everything will be OK.\nIf you really want to have Ubuntu inside Windows then I would recommend using virtual machine to do so. VirtualBox is a good choice: it is free and easy to use.\n\nA: I have to correct Mikołaj Bartnicki as in a post from Rinzwind from 18th April is stated that the WUBI installer is on the 14.04 ISO and works with windows up to 7. Windows 8 and Windows ME are not supported by WUBI. The only ISO that does not have WUBI is the 13.04 version (and that is end of life already)\nHowever, yes, there is a windows installer, but ubuntu don't want you to use it because it can cause problems (That is why ubuntu has made it harder to find wubi).\nTry instead to burn a dvd or create a bootable usb stick, and boot it from there. These methods are also very easy.\n\nA: You could try \"MobaLiveCD\". Its not exactly the same as WUBI, but similar.

Also, what are the approprate terms for the launcher, 'start button' etc so I can do a better google search on the issue next time?\n\nA: Usually, the button color is based on your desktop wallpaper, you can try to fix it by changing the wallpaper and then be back on the one you like.\nP.S.

Could someone recommend one?\nThanks in advance,\nCarl\n\nA: There are loads of SMS gateway services. These companies charge a small amount to provide you with a HTTP method to retrieve SMS messages sent to one of their phone numbers.\nThe charge is small (2p a message on one I was looking at) and usually without an ongoing commitment... But this is something that can add up.\nAlternatively, if you have a GSM modem and a valid SIM card, you could look at gsmsmsd. IMO the gateway is going to be more reliable but the modem might be cheaper at scale (there are many plans with unlimited messaging).\n\nA: I actually built a ssh via sms service called smsh a while back.  It's built on nodejs and has a sort of 2 factor authentication (a list of allowed phone numbers and a password prepending each command sent).  It uses the twilio api behind the scenes.  Configuring it is extremely easy and it's worked pretty well for me.\n\nA: You can a SSH server on your Ubuntu machine and a SSH client on the phone for that. For the SSH server, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nFor the SSH client on the phone, ConnectBot for Android works brilliantly (particularly with 'Hacker's Keyboard' for typing |, < and stuff).

I also tried to boot Mint disk and that won't work. Is it a Toshiba/Linux issue?\n\nA: Can you boot from USB / Removable Media in the BIOS? Some older machines can't...\nIf you can, use UnetBootin to write the ISO to USB and try to boot from that. Also, try another flavor, such as lubuntu or xubuntu.\n\nA: The Toshiba M45-S165 BIOS is not compatible with the syslinux boot loader used on Ubuntu images, and the BIOS does not support booting from USB. What you can do is download Plop boot manager, burn plpbt.iso to a CD and boot it, then insert your Ubuntu  USB drive and select the USB option at the menu.\nYou may find that this laptop is problematic in other ways and requires some kernel parameters to work correctly eg. noapic nolapic vga=771.

Result: 4211 load cycles in 180 hours. When the power adapter is unplugged and the laptop runs on battery, every ~3 seconds a new load cycle happens. This is way too much.\nSo my question is: Has anything changed since that discussion? What should I do to reduce the frequency of load cycles? Are the old solutions still valid / state of the art?\n\nA: As of May 2017, the discussion is still valid, at least for certain types of hard disks and the old solutions are still doing the job. The trick is to set the power management level to less aggressive. On most disks\n# hdparm -B /dev/yourdisk\n\nwill give you the APM (advanced power management) level currently set. You'll set it by the same command, with actual desired value.\n# hdparm -B 254 /dev/yourdisk\n\nValues range from 1 (the most aggressive power saving) to 254 (the least aggressive power saving). Values 128 and less will even allow spindown. 255 will disable APM altogether (not supported by every model).

Ubuntu Core is just a minimal install of Ubuntu, you could make something very similar yourself by running:\nmkdir chroot\ndebootstrap --arch=amd64 trusty chroot http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\n\nUbuntu Core is just a minimal rootfs of around 60MB size whereas Ubuntu Mini Remix is a 200MB iso live image.\n", "Q: Where do I start to create my own Ubuntu derivative? I would like to create my own Ubuntu derivative with my desktop environment of choice and my preferred set of prepackaged programs.\nWhat base should I start with and what modifications should I start adding?\nI know two possible starting points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Core, an official set of bare necessities (which ones?) that seems suitable for creating appliance firmware or one's very own Linux distribution. Unlike JeOS that came before it, this is not a complete distribution, as it lacks a bootable image with an installer or a boot loader.\n\n*Ubuntu Mini Remix, a fully working Ubuntu livecd containing only the minimal set of software to make the system work; not an official Ubuntu project.\n\n*probably I could use Ubuntu Server or something else as a base.\nThen, I need to customize my distribution. I know of the following tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Customization Kit\n\n*Ubuntu Builder\n\n*Customizer\nthat should allow for me to easily customize my installation media. But what if I need not just something to create a one-off remix of Ubuntu for my own enjoyment, but a maintainable project with all its trappings: I guess I need to have a set of scripts trackable by version control system, amenable for automated testing and building with some build infrastructure. That's how they build a halfway decent OS distribution, right?\nHow should I best start creating my own Ubuntu derivative in a way that could naturally transcend a one-off custom CD for myself, and be built in a more controlled, robust manner, like proper Ubuntu derivatives supposedly do?\n\nA: An Ubuntu remix is just a meta package (like xubuntu-desktop) that depends on whatever software should be installed by default. To get the source of some existing meta *buntu desktops do:\napt-get source xubuntu-desktop\napt-get source lubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will fetch the base package of x/lubuntu. It is just a regular Debian package, it has files debian/control debian/rules etc. It can be rebuilt by doing:\napt-get build-dep xubuntu-desktop\ndpkg-buildpackage -b -uc\n\nEach architecture has its own list of files to install (\"desktop-amd64\", \"desktop-powerpc\" etc). To create your own derivative:\n\n\n*\n\n*take the lubuntu/xubuntu source as a base\n\n*adapt it (eg. replace lubuntu with nicbuntu everywhere)\n\n*edit the dependency lists to add the packages you want\n\n*build your meta package\n\n*install it (dpkg -i nicbuntu.deb or gdebi nicbuntu.deb if you want to pull in dependencies)\n\n\nOnce you have your meta package working, you can build an installer iso image. There are plenty of answers already explaining how to do that (this one is quite detailed). \nThe only extra things you need to remember to do are:\n\n\n*\n\n*add your nicbuntu.deb and any packages it depends on to the iso image\n\n*regenerate the Packages file (apt-ftparchive, see linked answer)\n\n*add \"nicbuntu\" to the the pre-seed file (again, see linked answer)\n\n\nObviously there are a lot of specific details that you will need to get working, but basically that's all there is to it.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Question I have a question about installing Ubuntu 14.04 (I think, it's the newest distro. to my knowledge). I am currently running a dual boot to test it out, and I really love it!\nMy question is, will I be able to transfer files from my Windows to my Ubuntu before completely installing, and will I be able to save my Windows Restore files just incase I want to go back to Windows 8?\n\nA: Why not just stay dual booted?  You can relatively effectively run a dual boot environment on your computer.\n\nTo answer your actual questions:\n(1) Yes, you will be able to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu before removing Windows, if you truly don't want a dual boot configuration.\n(2) Your Windows restore points don't actually save your Windows OS entirely.  When you remove Windows, your restore points go away, so you'd have to reinstall Windows from scratch, then, if you want to go back to Windows after completely removing it.  This is why dual boot environments can be okay, so that if you don't want to completely lose what's on Windows, so you don't have to reinstall everything if you ever want to switch.\n", "Q: Linux newbie with Komodo edit installation issues I was watching a tutorial that needs komodo edit.

First obtain the offset via fdisk(8) and then specify it with the offset option to mount. Use fdisk to determine the starting sector of the partition and the sector size. Then calculate offset in bytes using the starting sector number and sector size in bytes. See Mount single partition from image of entire disk (device) for an example.\nFinally:\nmount -o offset=<offset in bytes> nps-2010-emails.dd /media/manu/\n\nIn a typical hard disk, the cells holding the data are grouped. The groupings are called sectors. The way we usually partition things, the first few sectors are kept aside for giving information about the partitions, leaving a gap. So if we have an image of an entire disk, these sectors also get included. Now, the mount command cannot directly start at the first byte, as the partition doesn't start at the first byte. So, we will have to tell mount how many bytes to skip (so that it can avoid the extra information)and get to the actual partition. This is called the offset. Now each sector can store a certain amount of information in bytes, which is called the size of a sector. We take the total size of information that can be stored in this gap by multiplying the size of a sector, with the size of the gap in number of sectors.\nFrom the output of fdisk there, you can see the sector size is 512 bytes and it starts at sector 1. So the offset is 1*512=512. Try the following command:\nmount -t vfat -o offset=512 ps-2010-emails.dd /media/manu/\n\nI added the filesystem type since fdisk gave it as FAT32. To mount it for writing as well, use -o offset=512,rw instead.\n\nA: You can also have the computer automatically scan all the partitions in a dump and automatically prepare all loop devices, as described here.\nSo, lets say you dumped your entire /dev/sda into something called sda.img. You can access its partitions as follows:\nlosetup -f -P sda.img\n\nOn my system, it then shows up as follows:\n\nIn non-GUI environments, you can list the created device with losetup -l, which will tell you the name of the loop device, example:\n# losetup -l\nNAME       SIZELIMIT OFFSET AUTOCLEAR RO BACK-FILE\n/dev/loop0         0      0         0  0 /path/mmcblk0\n\nYou can then mount say, the first partition, with:\nmount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/mypartition\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Can't add a comment because of lack of reputation, but want to tell to those of you who have GPT disk when testing it with fdisk, use gdsik instead to get start sector and count proper offset. It helped me.\nfdisk -l gave me:\n      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\nvm2080737.bak1   *           1        3901    31457279+  ee  GPT\n\nand it couldn't be mounted with 512 offset with an error 'mount: you must specify the filesystem type'\ngdisk -l gave me good result:\nNumber  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name\n   1              34             545   256.0 KiB   A501  gpboot\n   2             546          993825   485.0 MiB   A502  swap\n   3          993826        62914526   29.5 GiB    A503  rootfs\n\n", "Q: What is HDMI audio? I see \"Juniper HDMI Audio\" under my sound devices list.\n\nMy question is, what is it and what does it do? Currently, adjusting the volume level does nothing. Google searches don't give a very clear explanation of it, other than that HDMI can \"handle\" audio.\n\nA: HDMI is a video interface standard that combines electrical signaling for video and audio on one hot-pluggable cable (cable/connector designs aren't only about electrical differences but also their mechanical plug/unplug durability) \nHDMI standard has the capability of carrying audio, but a device does not necessarily have to. For computers that offer the audio over HDMI, there is usually a secondary sound card (which may be only logically separated in the drivers) that is responsible for encoding the sound output in the format specified by HDMI.\nThe volume control will not affect anything unless you are playing sound through the HDMI port, you can think of the volume control as a \"audio-out port\" volume that will only work if there is something connected to that port. \nSo if you connect your laptop to the TV and set the TV to read audio from HDMI, the volume control is likely to work. \n\nA: HDMI it is port video-audio  its look like \n \nu can plug it to a HDTV and on tv u have Video and sound from one cable.

This is against any security logic because anyone can already see the length of your password, which shouldn't be visible to anyone looking over your shoulder ;)\nUnix terminals don't show anything, but they do accept input. If it doesn't accept your password, that's a whole different issue then. If that's the case, open a new thread with as much detail as you can provide.\n\nA: When using terminal in any Linux Operating System such as Ubuntu, by default it set in such a way that the password typed is not at all visible to the user (not even the asterisks).

Any hint will be appretiate.\nThank\n\nA: Apache is a web server and it requires at least one active network interface to be able to work. When you turned off / unplugged your networks, you basically caused the network interfaces to become unavailable. To fix this, you could configure a local \"Loopback Adapter\" connection that will work over your loopback IP (127.0.0.1) and will always be available. \nNote however that if you configure multiple network adapters that may be on or off in different combinations, you will need to configure your VHosts for multiple IP addresses (you will have at least one IP address for each network adapter). Otherwise, you will find different sets of VHosts becoming unavailable when you turn off particular network connections.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 crashing after while My ubuntu server 14.04 stops working after week or so.

What is difference between these command: I used cd $HOME/directory/test/ before running each lines:\ncd ~\ncd /\ncd ~/\ncd -\ncd --\ncd /.\ncd $HOME\ncd $USR\ncd\n\nAnd all of these do the same behavior. What is difference?\n\nA: cd ~\n\nChanges to your home directory. ~ at the beginning of a path is an abbreviation meaning “the user's home directory”.\ncd /\n\nChanges to the root directory /. Nothing special going on here.\ncd ~/\n\nThe trailing / doesn't make any difference. It forces ~ to be interpreted as a directory, but cd does that anyway. (A trailing / makes a difference on a symbolic link to a directory — compare ls -ld /var/spool/mail and ls -ld /var/spool/mail/.)\ncd -\n\nChanges to the directory that you were in before the previous cd command. This is a special case of the cd command: when its argument is -, it does this.\ncd --\n\nWith most commands, including cd, the argument -- means that anything that comes afterwards will be treated as an operand rather than an option. So for example cd -- -P means to change into a directory called -P, whereas cd -P passes the -P option (which makes a difference if the path that you change into goes via a symbolic link). When there is no argument after --, the -- doesn't do anything; this command is equivalent to plain cd. cd with no argument, in turn, is a shortcut for cd ~.\ncd /.\n\nEquivalent to cd /, since /. is the same directory as / (. is mostly useful on its own, to mean “the current directory”).\ncd $HOME\n\nChanges to your home directory. This fails if the path to your home directory contains a space or other characters. Always use double quotes around variable substitutions: cd \"$HOME\".\ncd $USR\n\nIn all likelihood, this does nothing because no variable named USR is defined in your shell, hence the command that runs is just cd.\n\nA: The simple command cd <dir> which changes directory to <dir>. \n\n\n*\n\n*~ indicates $HOME directory\n\n*/ indicates the root directory \n\n*~/ indicates the $HOME directory as well. The only difference is that it explicitly shows it's a directory (the trailing slash). cd ~/ and cd and cd ~ and cd $HOME all do exactly the same thing. \n\n*cd - Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.\n\n\n\nThese special symbols \".\" (dot) and \"..\" (dot dot)[Relative Parameters]:\nThe \".\" symbol refers to the current directory and the \"..\" symbol refers to the current\ndirectory's parent directory.\n\n$USER and $HOME are Environment-Variables\n$USER = The name of the currently logged-in user. This variable is set by the system. You probably shouldn't change its value manually. (ex:myuser1)\n$HOME = The location of the currently logged-in user's home directory.(ex: /home/myuser1)\nRecommended to use cd \"$HOME\" or cd \"$USER\" so-that cd gets proper input in case of space, etc.\n", "Q: Why does installing Kubuntu-desktop prompt me to remove \"lpr\"?

Also I wanna make sure that removing this package won't affect unity's features or whatever.\n\nA: lpr is the BSD print spooler and utilities. It typically isn't used in the various *buntu flavors (Ubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Studio, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Lubuntu) anymore. A newer variant, included in the cups-bsd package, provides the same functionality and includes support for Internet Printing Protocol.\nThe package kubuntu-desktop recommends the package cups-bsd.

So, my question is simple:\nIs it possible to convert those SUSE Linux device drivers to be used in Ubuntu 14.04 and if it is, how? \n\nA: The description in the download table is wrong (probably, HP only wants to support one distribution), the drivers are just .tar files, i.e. archives which should work for all Linux distributions.\nHowever, usually, there is no need to download any drivers from the manufacturer's webpage, since all drivers are either available out of the box or can be installed through the package management.\nedit: Scratch it, HP indeed packed rpm packages into the archives. The second part is, however, still true, you should not need to install any drivers from HP's webpage.\n\nA: No. The Suse driver is built for kernel 3.0.76. You need a driver that is built for the Ubuntu 14.04 kernel, which is currently at 3.13.0.\nThe Suse driver is based on this github repository of a Chinese Canonical employee, he says there \"The current status of the driver is it works under 3.5, and possibly fails to even compile in later version of kernels.\" According to reports in Launchpad bug #1220146 that driver does not work with later kernels even if you do compile it. \nFrom the discussion on linux-kernel-wireless it appears that someone is planning to do the work to get this wireless device supported in the mainline kernel, but it has not been done yet. \nUnless you are willing to help port or test the new driver that will be developed (see linux-kernel-wireless link), there is nothing you can do but wait.\n", "Q: How can I add an account to the sudo list?

I'm interesting in avoiding the installation of the content of a debian package when a file is present in the system, eg. /usr/local/bin/token.\nI'd like than the debian package will look for the token in the pre-installation phase (preinst?) and decide to install or not the content afterwards, maybe I could just delete the content to avoid copying anything.\n\nA: If the preinst script exits with an error (non-zero exit code), dpkg calls the postrm script with abort-install as argument, according to the Debian wiki. So you can test for the file's existence in preinst before anything is done, do an exit 1, if it exists, and do nothing in postrm if called with abort-install and the file exists (since the postrm for must be certain that the install failed due to the existence of that file). \n", "Q: There are no repos I have PC Engines Apu . I wanted to install Linux to Apu over PXE. I m trying to install this on ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I am Using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n#yum install tftp-server syslinux httpd dhcpd\n\nThere are no enabled repos.\n Run \"Yum repolist all\" to see the repos you have.\n You can enable repos with yum-config-manager --enable <repo>\n\n#yum repolist all\nrepolist: 0\n\n\nA: The yum package manager comes from RedHat and its derivatives. It installs rpm packages from repositories that store such packages. The Debian (and by extension, Ubuntu) repositories have .deb packages instead. The equivalent of yum in the Debian/Ubuntu world is apt-get. I have no idea why you ended up with yum installed on your Ubuntu system but it's not the tool you want to use. \nWhat you're after is:\nsudo apt-get install tftp tftpd syslinux apache2 dhcpcd\n\nIn any case, that's my best guess since you don't actually explain what you're trying to install. There's no tftp-server package in Ubuntu so I'm guessing you want tftpd which is a server that supports the TFTP protocol. Likewise, there's no httpd in Ubuntu but I'm guessing you want to install the apache2 webserver and a dhcp client (dhcpd).\n", "Q: What is the cause of root's being 100%? I have a 5-yr old Ubuntu laptop. It's running 12.04 LTS, and has never given me much if any trouble. Last night while updating, a disk analyzer popped up, and said I had very little space left. It was correct.\nSince then, I've been manually cleaning up old kernels and their related files under /boot. I'm down from 95% to 89%. I've looked under /var/spool and cleaned up many, but not very large spool files that never printed from a long time ago. The disk analyzer just points to root at 100%, showing /usr at 45% and a trickle for everything else including /home.\nI checked with Synaptic. I don't have big packages installed like apache or mysql. What else could be filling up the disk and how should I approach the clean-up other than a brute force install?\nI am using this script\n#!/bin/bash\n\nORPHANS=`deborphan`\nif [ ! -z \"$ORPHANS\" ]; then\n    dpkg --remove $ORPHANS\nfi\n\nPURGES=`dpkg --list | grep ^rc | awk '{ print $2; }'`\nif [ ! -z \"$PURGES\" ]; then\n    dpkg --purge $PURGES\nfi\n\nthat I found here.\nHowever, this has only taken root down to 88%, and adding deborphan added 1%, when I had to install it.\n\nA: The most likely place to look into is /var/log/. I remember a time when logrotate was not configured to handle all relevant log files. \nStart with du -sh /var/log/* to see if there is a \"huge\" directory there. \n\nA: If you have multiple partitions, first don't bother cleaning non full partitions. Focus on the one that is full. \nYou can df -h /some/dir to check if the partition containing /some/dir is full or not (of course there could be yet another partition mounted underneath.. if so, take it into consideration)\nYou can also look for the biggest dirs by sorting each dirextory's size : as root, do a df -kS / | sort -n and be patient... (as sort needs the whole output before sorting, you will see everything once the du finishes) (du -kS differ from du -ks : it doesn't count subdirs, so it helps pinpoint the exact dir containing the bigger files. Works with gnu du, at least.)\nAnother way : as root, find -type f -size +100000 -ls | sort -k7,7n to find the biggest files by only outputting the biggest (more than 512x100000=51Mb) (as the size arg is in 512 bytes (the default block size)). The number 7 in sort is to sort on the 7th field. Adjust if the size is in another field (I do this from memory, I'm travelling...) (-k7,7n tells sort to sort numerically \"from the 7th to the 7th field\" as othrrwise sort sort fields 7th to the last, which could usually not be what you want...)\n", "Q: Should I use Ubuntu OS on a new laptop supplied without an OS?

If you're asking how you can find the \"Real\" okular desktop file, it's the one that's actually called okular.desktop:\nls /usr/share/applications/kde4/okular.desktop\n\nTo see the differences, you can run diff. For example:\n diff okular.desktop okularApplication_dvi.desktop \n\nThat will show you that the differences are basically in the mimetypes and KDE categories associated with each .desktop file. These are just internal tricks used by the desktop environment (KDE for example) to correctly classify programs in its menus and file associations. For example, the plain okular.desktop is categorized as \n$ grep Categories okular.desktop\nCategories=Qt;KDE;Graphics;Office;Viewer;\n\nWhile the okularApplication_dvi.desktop (which is okular acting as  .dvi viewer) is:\n$ grep Categories okularApplication_dvi.desktop\nCategories=Qt;KDE;Graphics;Viewer;\n\nNote that it is not categorized as Office since this is okular in its manifestation as a dvi viewer. \nBasically, these are all internal details that you can safely ignore.

Hello Everyone,\n                  I wish to install ubuntu to my External USB Hard Drive. When I choose the something else option, the installer detects both my internal drive (SDA) and my External drive (SDB). The installer wants me to unmount both of them but unmounting SDA drive is dangerous? I have read articles stating that you must disconnect SDA first. I don't want to touch the SDA drive. Is there another way to install ubuntu to the external drive? If I unmount SDA, will that not cause the internal drive to fail to boot to windows?\n\nA: \nunmounting SDA drive is dangerous?\n\nUnmounting makes that drive inaccessible for read or write operations. It is a Linux only feature, so Windows drives are not affected by it.\n\nI don't want to touch the SDA drive.\n\nIf it is unmounted during the installation then it won't be touched. However, if you choose to write the bootloader on it or make any other operations to it, it will be automatically mounted!\n\nIf I unmount SDA, will that not cause the internal drive to fail to boot to windows?\n\nNo. This has nothing to do with Windows.\nWhen installing Ubuntu on an external drive, the location of the bootloader is of interest.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install the bootloader on the internal drive (sda), then no matter if external is not plugged in, you will have an option to boot Ubuntu when you start up your computer. If you choose it, it will give an error. Choosing Windows will boot into Windows.\n\n*If you install the bootloader on the external drive (sdb), nothing will be modified on Windows drive. No menu to choose OS will appear. If you plug in your external drive, your computer will boot into Ubuntu from it only if it is set as the first drive in your BIOS settings. Otherwise it will boot into Windows.\n\n\nA: When you boot the install disk, you Windows drive was most likely mounted (or you mounted it).  Mounting means that Ubuntu will be able to read or write files to it.  Since it is your Windows partition, it is actually more dangerous to have it mounted than unmounted, because unmounted you can't write to it, mounted you can accidentally mess things up.\nWhen you unmount a drive on Ubuntu, it does not affect the data on it in any way, so you are perfectly safe unmounting it.\nIt sounds like you are new to this, so be carefully when choosing \"Something Else\" in installation.\nI will give you two ways to do what you are trying to achieve:\nEasy Way/Safest Way\nTo be Totally safe, shut you computer down, get out a screw driver and remove the Windows hard drive.  Boot Ubuntu Installation Disk with you external drive plugged in.  Now you have absolutely no worries!  Keep in mind that your external drive will be sda in this case when you physically remove your Windows drive.\nAdvanced Way / Risky If You Don't Follow Exactly!\n\n\n*\n\n*When asked to \"Unmount partitions that are in use?\", answer yes.\n\n*Look in the device column.  You will see sdb.  That's just the name of the device.  Make damn sure sdb is your external.  A device may or may not have partitions.  Partitions divide the physical device up with names like, sdb1, sdb2.  Choose a partition on /dev/sdb. By choosing, I mean click on it so that it is highlighted.\nIf no partition exists, I would suggest exiting and using gparted to make an ext4 partition then come back to this point. (The partition will need to be probably 5 gig or bigger, don't remember exactly.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Now that you have the partition on the device sdb selected you want to install to, press the change button.\n\n*A window will appear.  In the \"Use As\", combo box, select Ext4 journal file system.  Check the format check button.  Then, in the \"Mount Point\" combo box, select the \"/\" symbol.\n\n*DANGER HERE:  You said you don't want your windows drive touched?  Ok, where it says \"Device for boot loader installation\", there is a combo box.  It most likely has /dev/sda selected, which would be your Windows drive.  Change that to /dev/sdb.\n\n*Double check everything has been done exactly or if you don't understand for some reason some step, just quit and come back here with further questions.  If you feel you have followed everything exactly, then proceed by pressing the \"Install Now\" button.\n\n*You may be asked about swap, it's optional.

It worked in LightDM and it worked in GNOME. I would press R. Alt+E and I would get \"è\".\nThen recently it changed. LightDM still works, but when in GNOME, it became two key strokes: R. Alt+E. then a few days ago, one of my user IDs decided to stop working entirely. Compose key behaves like a normal Alt key. But only in one user ID; my other user ID still works.\n\n*\n\n*I have XKBOPTIONS=\"compose:ralt\" in /etc/default/keyboard (I think that's why LightDM works).\n\n*I went to the keyboard settings and tried to set the compose key.

Still don't know why it went from one keystroke to two, but the inability to use it at all was my main reason for posting this question.\ndconf had an override value for /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/numlock-state.

This worked for all users except one, even in console mode.\nI checked the files ${HOME}/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/keyboard-layout.xml (which are updated by Settings → Keyboard → Layout). One user who had never changed his layout had no such file. Another user with a working compose-key had a “reasonable” setup. Therefore I tried to copy this setup to the problematic user to no avail.

This\nallows increased kernel security by disallowing the loading of unsigned modules\nor modules signed with an invalid key.  Module signing increases security by\nmaking it harder to load a malicious module into the kernel.  The module\nsignature checking is done by the kernel so that it is not necessary to have\ntrusted userspace bits.\nThis facility uses X.509 ITU-T standard certificates to encode the public keys\ninvolved.  The signatures are not themselves encoded in any industrial standard\ntype.  The facility currently only supports the RSA public key encryption\nstandard (though it is pluggable and permits others to be used).  The possible\nhash algorithms that can be used are SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and\nSHA-512 (the algorithm is selected by data in the signature).\n\nCONFIGURING MODULE SIGNING\nThe module signing facility is enabled by going to the \"Enable Loadable Module\nSupport\" section of the kernel configuration and turning on\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG   \"Module signature verification\"\n\nThis has a number of options available:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Require modules to be validly signed\" (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE)\nThis specifies how the kernel should deal with a module that has a signature for which the key is not known or a module that is unsigned.\nIf this is off (ie. \"permissive\"), then modules for which the key is not available and modules that are unsigned are permitted, but the kernel will be marked as being tainted, and the concerned modules will be marked as tainted, shown with the character 'E'.\nIf this is on (ie. \"restrictive\"), only modules that have a valid signature that can be verified by a public key in the kernel's possession will be loaded.  All other modules will generate an error.\nIrrespective of the setting here, if the module has a signature block that cannot be parsed, it will be rejected out of hand.\n\n*\"Automatically sign all modules\" (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL)\nIf this is on then modules will be automatically signed during the modules_install phase of a build.  If this is off, then the modules must be signed manually using:\nscripts/sign-file\n\n\n*\"Which hash algorithm should modules be signed with?\"\nThis presents a choice of which hash algorithm the installation phase will sign the modules with:\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA1      \"Sign modules with SHA-1\"\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA224    \"Sign modules with SHA-224\"\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA256    \"Sign modules with SHA-256\"\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA384    \"Sign modules with SHA-384\"\nCONFIG_MODULE_SIG_SHA512    \"Sign modules with SHA-512\"\n\nThe algorithm selected here will also be built into the kernel (rather than being a module) so that modules signed with that algorithm can have their signatures checked without causing a dependency loop.\n\n*\"File name or PKCS#11 URI of module signing key\" (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY)\nSetting this option to something other than its default of \"certs/signing_key.pem\" will disable the autogeneration of signing keys and allow the kernel modules to be signed with a key of your choosing. The string provided should identify a file containing both a private key and its corresponding X.509 certificate in PEM form, or — on systems where the OpenSSL ENGINE_pkcs11 is functional — a PKCS#11 URI as defined by RFC7512. In the latter case, the PKCS#11 URI should reference both a certificate and a private key.\nIf the PEM file containing the private key is encrypted, or if the PKCS#11 token requries a PIN, this can be provided at build time by means of the KBUILD_SIGN_PIN variable.\n\n*\"Additional X.509 keys for default system keyring\" (CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS)\nThis option can be set to the filename of a PEM-encoded file containing additional certificates which will be included in the system keyring by default.\nNote that enabling module signing adds a dependency on the OpenSSL devel packages to the kernel build processes for the tool that does the signing.\n\nGENERATING SIGNING KEYS\nCryptographic keypairs are required to generate and check signatures.  A\nprivate key is used to generate a signature and the corresponding public key is used to check it.  The private key is only needed during the build, after which it can be deleted or stored securely.  The public key gets built into the kernel so that it can be used to check the signatures as the modules are\nloaded.\nUnder normal conditions, when CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY is unchanged from its default, the kernel build will automatically generate a new keypair using\nopenssl if one does not exist in the file:\ncerts/signing_key.pem\n\nduring the building of vmlinux (the public part of the key needs to be built\ninto vmlinux) using parameters in the:\ncerts/x509.genkey\n\nfile (which is also generated if it does not already exist).\nIt is strongly recommended that you provide your own x509.genkey file.\nMost notably, in the x509.genkey file, the req_distinguished_name section\nshould be altered from the default:\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\n#O = Unspecified company\nCN = Build time autogenerated kernel key\n#emailAddress = unspecified.user@unspecified.company\n\nThe generated RSA key size can also be set with:\n[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 4096\n\nIt is also possible to manually generate the key private/public files using the\nx509.genkey key generation configuration file in the root node of the Linux\nkernel sources tree and the openssl command.  The following is an example to\ngenerate the public/private key files:\nopenssl req -new -nodes -utf8 -sha256 -days 36500 -batch -x509 \\\n   -config x509.genkey -outform PEM -out kernel_key.pem \\\n   -keyout kernel_key.pem\n\nThe full pathname for the resulting kernel_key.pem file can then be specified\nin the CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY option, and the certificate and key therein will\nbe used instead of an autogenerated keypair.\n\nPUBLIC KEYS IN THE KERNEL\nThe kernel contains a ring of public keys that can be viewed by root.  They're\nin a keyring called \".system_keyring\" that can be seen by:\n[root@deneb ~]# cat /proc/keys\n...\n223c7853 I------     1 perm 1f030000     0     0 keyring   .system_keyring: 1\n302d2d52 I------     1 perm 1f010000     0     0 asymmetri Fedora kernel signing key: d69a84e6bce3d216b979e9505b3e3ef9a7118079: X509.RSA a7118079 []\n...\n\nBeyond the public key generated specifically for module signing, additional trusted certificates can be provided in a PEM-encoded file referenced by the CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS configuration option.\nFurther, the architecture code may take public keys from a hardware store and add those in also (e.g. from the UEFI key database).\nFinally, it is possible to add additional public keys by doing:\nkeyctl padd asymmetric \"\" [.system_keyring-ID] <[key-file]\n\ne.g.:\nkeyctl padd asymmetric \"\" 0x223c7853 <my_public_key.x509\n\nNote, however, that the kernel will only permit keys to be added to\n.system_keyring if the new key's X.509 wrapper is validly signed by a key\nthat is already resident in the .system_keyring at the time the key was added.\n\nMANUALLY SIGNING MODULES\nTo manually sign a module, use the scripts/sign-file tool available in\nthe Linux kernel source tree.  The script requires 4 arguments:\n1.  The hash algorithm (e.g., sha256)\n2.  The private key filename or PKCS#11 URI\n3.  The public key filename\n4.  The kernel module to be signed\n\nThe following is an example to sign a kernel module:\nscripts/sign-file sha512 kernel-signkey.priv \\\n    kernel-signkey.x509 module.ko\n\nThe hash algorithm used does not have to match the one configured, but if it\ndoesn't, you should make sure that hash algorithm is either built into the\nkernel or can be loaded without requiring itself.\nIf the private key requires a passphrase or PIN, it can be provided in the\n$KBUILD_SIGN_PIN environment variable.\n\nSIGNED MODULES AND STRIPPING\nA signed module has a digital signature simply appended at the end.  The string\n\"~Module signature appended~.\" at the end of the module's file confirms that a\nsignature is present but it does not confirm that the signature is valid!\nSigned modules are BRITTLE as the signature is outside of the defined ELF\ncontainer.  Thus they MAY NOT be stripped once the signature is computed and\nattached.  Note the entire module is the signed payload, including any and all\ndebug information present at the time of signing.\n\nLOADING SIGNED MODULES\nModules are loaded with insmod, modprobe, init_module() or finit_module(),\nexactly as for unsigned modules as no processing is done in userspace.  The\nsignature checking is all done within the kernel.\n\nNON-VALID SIGNATURES AND UNSIGNED MODULES\nIf CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is enabled or enforcemodulesig=1 is supplied on\nthe kernel command line, the kernel will only load validly signed modules\nfor which it has a public key.   Otherwise, it will also load modules that are\nunsigned.   Any module for which the kernel has a key, but which proves to have\na signature mismatch will not be permitted to load.\nAny module that has an unparseable signature will be rejected.\n\nADMINISTERING/PROTECTING THE PRIVATE KEY\nSince the private key is used to sign modules, viruses and malware could use\nthe private key to sign modules and compromise the operating system.  The\nprivate key must be either destroyed or moved to a secure location and not kept\nin the root node of the kernel source tree.\n\nA: Edit ./include/generated/autoconf.h and change the line\ndefine CONFIG_MODULE_SIG 1\n\nto \ndefine CONFIG_MODULE_SIG 0\n\n", "Q: Make a wireless keyboard always use specified layout This really should be a comment on a reply to the question How to permanently assign a different keyboard layout to a USB keyboard?

Only your computer and its BIOS control booting.  After all, Ubuntu is not even read until the BIOS decides which disk to boot, and if it doesn't boot the Ubuntu disk, how can Ubuntu do anything?\nUpgrading is another story.  If the upgrade didn't work, it can be fixed, most likely.  Have you tried pressing ctrl+alt_F2 (or F3, F4, F5, F6, but not F7 - that's the GUI)?

I've been searching for quite a while, and all I've found is where LibreOffice added support to be able to open MS Publisher files in Draw.  But I will soon be putting lubuntu on my parents computer, and my mom uses Publisher a lot for work (teacher), and she does some stuff at home.  If she opens a publisher file, edits it, then tries to open it at work, will she be able to?  If not, is there another program that this will work with?  If not, it looks like my only option will be to put VB or VM Ware on an eight year old computer and install XP in there and hope it doesn't die...\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: probaby your mom can open the file check this out\nhttp://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/14/can-i-use-microsoft-publisher-files-with-libreoffice/\n\nA: Libreoffice should, but if you don't like the results, try Scribus.\n\nScribus is a desktop publishing (DTP) application. Scribus is designed\n  for flexible layout and typesetting, and the ability to prepare files\n  for professional quality image setting equipment.

But the answer is no, MS Office doesn't support any Libre Office file; they are already a bit in danger of the free alternative solution becoming more popular. They will surely not support anytime soon... Yet as an alternative, you can export it as a PDF, as shown below:\n \n", "Q: Problem with installing Lubuntu via USB on an Acer Aspire one ZG5 I tried installing Lubuntu on an Acer Aspire ZG5 via an bootable USB I made with UNetbootin.

When I try to boot up normally the computer doesn't boot and it makes a loud beeping sound.\nWhat did I do wrong? Do i need to make a new bootable USB? try another distro?\n\nA: Try formatting your pendrive and making a new bootable pendrive using Unetbootin. Or Just to be extra sure why don't you try using another software like rufus, etc. and see if the problem persists.\n", "Q: LD Library Path I am not sure whether my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is working. \nI installed Qt5.2.1 on Ubuntu and tried to execute an application from the command line using sudo ./App1. ( App1 needs sudo access, hence I executed this way)\nThe folder having *.so files Qt5.2.1/Tools/QtCreator/lib/qtcreator is provided in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in bashrc file, but I am getting the following error\n./App1: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Quick.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nWhen I copied all the Qt so files from QtCreator to /usr/lib, the application worked.\nCan someone help me understand the concept, why it is not able to take the library from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, whereas it works with Qt so files in the standard /usr/lib path\nAlso, what should be done to make this work without copying the .so files to /usr/lib.\n\nA: Your user's LD_LIBRARY_PATH will not, by default, be inherited by the sudo environment. According to the sudoers manpage (man sudoers):\n By default, the env_reset option is enabled.  This causes commands to be\n executed with a new, minimal environment.  On AIX (and Linux systems\n without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents of the\n /etc/environment file.  The new environment contains the TERM, PATH,\n HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME and SUDO_* variables in addi‐\n tion to variables from the invoking process permitted by the env_check\n and env_keep options.  This is effectively a whitelist for environment\n variables.\n\nNote that env_keep is unlikely to work for LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the reason noted later in the section:\n Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove vari‐\n ables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of setuid\n executables, including sudo.  Depending on the operating system this may\n include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and others.\n These type of variables are removed from the environment before sudo even\n begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for sudo to preserve\n them.\n\nYou must either find a way to make your application run without sudo, or install the libraries that it needs in one of the standard library locations.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox Refuses to start I recently opened rhythmbox, tried to play a song, and it froze.

The above problem still persists.\nEdit: I've gone into the control manager thingy, enabled unity and everything it needed. Still doesn't seem to work.

I have also tried googling for fixes, and have found nothing.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: *\n\n*If sounds stops randomly, this is certainly a pulseaudio problem: you can remove Pulseaudio and stay without it in the case you have only one sound device (internal sound card and  no bluetooth or other  ) . At least,removing  it temporarily is a good test for your problem. \n\n*To remove it:\nsudo apt-get purge pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer\nReboot and set the volume with the Gnome Alsa mixer (in the multimedia menu), or alsamixer in a terminal. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to go back to Pulseaudio, look here (from no 4  item):\nAudio suddenly stopped, pulseaudio reinstall has not helped?

I want to do it by dragging windows.\n\nA: Making the assumption you are using xubuntu 14.04 there are a couple of GUI options you could explore:\nUsing the Window Manager - Advanced options you can disable the scrolling of workspaces when dragging the window left and right.  This will tile the window on these borders.\n\nAlternatively if you dont use workspaces, by simply reducing the workspaces to 1 then windows will automatically snap to left and right\n\nIf you are using xubuntu 12.04 then tiling is not a built in option for the window manager.

So I found somewhere in the net that in order to install those package, you need to extract it to a place (in my case /home/cermanialop/Téléchargements/vlc-1.0.1) than install gcc to compile software. After I have done this, I gave in a terminal the path to the extracted files (with the command cd /home/louis/Téléchargements/vlc-1.0.1), than I opened the INSTALL file which was included in the package to know what to do. \nHere's the content of the file:\n******INSTALL file for the VLC media player\nMore extensive information for *nix, Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS users can be\nfound here: http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/\nBootstrapping VLC\n=================\nIf you retrieved VLC from the git server and do not have a \"configure\"\nscript, please refer to the HACKING file.\nConfiguring VLC\n===============\nA typical way to configure VLC is:\n   ./configure --prefix=/usr\nSee `./configure --help' for more information.\nIf you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging\nsymbols:\n   make distclean ; ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug\nWe recommend using GCC to build VLC, though some people reported success\nwith the Intel C compiler (version 8) as well. GCC version 3.3 or higher is\nrequired. On older systems (e.g. FreeBSD 4.x, BeOS), please select a more\nrecent version manually by setting the CC and CXX environment variables\nappropriately while running the ./configure shell script.\nBuilding VLC\n============\nOnce configured, run `make' to build VLC.\nInstalling and running VLC\n==========================\nYou can install the VLC and its plugins by typing:\n   make install\nBut you don't need to install it if you don't want to; VLC can be launched\nfrom the current directory as well:\n   ./vlc\nBuilding packages\n=================\nTo build a Debian package, you need to get the packaging info\n   svn co svn://svn.debian.org/pkg-multimedia/videolan/vlc/debian debian \nand then\n   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc\nTo build RPM packages, copy a spec file from extra/package/rpm and:\n   rpm -ba vlc.spec\nTo build an ipkg package (iPAQ familiar Linux), use:\n   ipkg-buildpackage******\n\nI have been following all those settings (first type ./configure to check directory for dependencies, after I run that, it give me this back: \ncermanialop@cermanialop-R051CX:~$ cd /home/louis/Téléchargements/vlc-1.0.1\ncermanialop@cermanialop-R051CX:~/Téléchargements/vlc-1.0.1$ ./configure\nchecking build system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu\nchecking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\nchecking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p\nchecking for gawk... no\nchecking for mawk... mawk\nchecking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes\nchecking how to create a ustar tar archive... gnutar\nchecking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... yes\nchecking for style of include used by make...

If you are not, please go onto my next suggestion. \nHowever, IF YOU ARE USING WINE, you might want to check out PlayOnLinux. This is a wrapper for people who are less experienced with Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) and it allows for easily managing multiple WINE prefixes. That being said, most likely if you followed the first result on google to install League of Legends on linux, you are using a seriously outdated version. I recommend following a very recent guide and for sure using a version of WINE such as 1.7 or above. You also might want to check out a special patch called CSMT. PlayonLinux has certain patched versions that are available. To install PlayOnLinux, you will have to go to this website (CLICK HERE) and scroll down until you see the \"Ubuntu\" tab. You will then be instructed how to install PlayOnLinux.\nIF YOU HAVE NOT MODIFIED YOUR NVIDIA DRIVERS you will need to make a check. Go to your settings and go to the drivers/updates section. After you get there, you will need to look for a tab that says drivers and look to see what Nvidia driver you are using. Chances are, you are using NOUVEAU drivers which are Open-Source. At the moment, these are not as fast as the Nvidia drivers you can get through Ubuntu's repository and not even close to as fast as those in the Xorg-Edgers PPA. If you see that NOUVEAU drivers are selected, this is also a large reason your performance may be poor. You can select another driver such as Nvidia 331 or Nvidia 334. Also, if you'd like, you can check out Xorg-Edgers. To get their repository AND get Nvidia 337 drivers, run the following command in your terminal window:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-337\n\nThen, save all of your work and reboot your computer. MAKE SURE YOU COPY THE ENTIRE CODE ENTERED ABOVE AND then open up a terminal window (using Alt+T) and then right click and select paste. Then hit enter and the installation process will begin. I will try to post pictures in a few hours to show you how to get up and running as well.\nPlease comment if you've tried BOTH of these and nothing worked so I will try to troubleshoot the problem.

I installed ubuntu and was running it for a month before I wanted windows back to run some programs that I couldn't run on ubuntu. I had accidentally deleted my recovery partition and overwrote windows when I installed ubuntu. I eventually got windows 7 back on my computer but now I don't know how to boot up ubuntu again. I still have ubuntu on a bootable partition and windows is on it's on bootable partition. Can anyone tell me how I can boot up ubuntu again? thanks :)\n\nA: You can install boot-repair and repair grub. so that you can dual boot. Create a ubuntu live usb/cd, boot from that and install boot-repair. Here is how to repair grub http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\n\nA: Try using EasyBCD to add Ubuntu to your windows bootloader.\nAfter you install it, run the program and click Add new entry, then click the Linux/BSD tab, then choose GRUB2 on the type and type Ubuntu in the name box. For the drive box, either leave it on Automatically locate and load or select the partition/drive Ubuntu is on. Now click Add Entry. After you have done this, click BCD Deployment at the left side, and press Write MBR.\nThis should take you to either Ubuntu, or the GRUB2 boot menu, where you can continue on to Ubuntu, depending on your settings.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Here is what happened.\nWindows is dumb.  It thinks that it's bootloader is the best, thus when installing windows 7, it will install itself over grub.  No since windows is dumb, it can't see the ext file systems, so it can't tell that grub is there.  You see two answeres above.  The first one suggests neosmart easybcd.  That is a fine option, probably the easiest, but there is another.  The boot repair disk. \nWhy the choices?\nWith easy bcd, the program adds Ubuntu into the windows boot loader.  With boot repair disk, it reinstalls grub2.  \nSo it's your choice.  Do you like the (ugly) windows boot menu, or the very customizable (and awesome) grub2 boot loader.  \nMost people would rather go with grub.  \nI would install grub, and then burg.  Google burg.\nThis isn't so much a Ubuntu related question.  Of course, boot repair disk is based off of Ubuntu core files, though.\nEvery time you install a new version of windows, you will need to boot into the boot repair disk, and reinstall grub to the MBR.\nYou'd think windows would just give you the option to write wbm to the MBR :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Start live boot with ubuntu (select Try ubuntu option)\n\n*Open terminal command using\nCtrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type follow command and press Enter\nsudo apt-get install grub2 grub-pc\nthen run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot your computer and remove Ubuntu live boot device (ex: DVD or\nUSB drive).\nEnjoy.\n\nA: You need to recover your GRUB:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n", "Q: Where can I find a log or see the progress of importing images in MAAS?

I deleted Ubuntu using windows disk management, created a win 8 recovery USB disk to repair MBR and rebooted. The system went into grub rescue. I am not able to go into BIOS at all (pressing F2 no response). Can somebody help me out?\n\nA: A: Was a BIOS setting changed? (ie fastboot enabled)\nB: Did the system come with windows 8?\nIf B was true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely power off\n\n*Hold f2\n\n*Power on (still holding f2)\n\n\nDid your motherboard start beeping?  If so, then you have some funky BIOS settings enabled.  Your boot mode might be set to CSM when trying to access windows 8, which might have been installed in UEFI mode.  \nI had both of these problems.  If fast-boot is enabled, it gets a lot harder to access BIOS.  You might have to do a CMOS reset.  This just means, take out CMOS battery, leave it out for bout an hour, put it back in, tada.  \nYou can also try pulling out your hard drive.  Then you should boot right to the BIOS, assuming you don't have a bootable USB/LAN/ODD device plugged in.\n\nA: I have solved the issue by removing the battery, waiting for 5 minutes and then reinserting it. I then switched the laptop on (only on battery, not on external power supply) and voila - I was able to select BIOS by pressing F2\n\nA: Firstly, I'd make sure you still have a Windows partition. You can check this by entering \nls\n\nAt grub rescue. You should have at least one partition called MSDOS(1) or something of the like. If you don't have that, chances are you cooked your hard drive and need a clean install. \nAssuming it's still there, you definitely need to get into the BIOS as it sounds like it's set to boot from HDD rather than USB first. To get into the BIOS, I'll assume that F2 is the correct key. You need to press this before the GrUB is loaded. Once GrUB is up, it's kind of like you're in a mini OS, it's too late to get into the BIOS, you need to reboot and try again. \n", "Q: BURG installation I've been reading about the BURG bootloader as a replacement for GRUB2.\nIf I install BURG, will it overwrite GRUB and all of its settings? How will things work, and how do I install themes?\n\nA: Grub is basically the same thing as burg.  It's just more appealing looking.  Here's what I recommend:\nGoggle: grub customizer\nIt's a Linux program.  I figure your on Linux if you have grub2, and by the fact that your on a Ubuntu q&a site.  Anyway, that is pretty easy to install.  \nOnce it is installed, open it up.  In one of the drop down menus, there is an option that says \"change environment\".  Click.  Where it says grub2, deselect that and select burg.  Hit okay.  Now go to file>install to mbr.  This will install burg to your master boot record.  Now you can edit some of the entries if you wish.  \nNow when you are booting up, and the burg screen shows up, press [t].  Then use the arrow keys, and select an option.  To install new themes, listen up.\nDownload a them via handy-dandy Internet.  Go to your computer folder, the to boot>Burt>themes.  Here u see lots of folders.  Just paste in one of those downloaded themes.  If the theme has icons, make sure you put those in the icons folder.  You will probably have to edit the burg file for burg to recognize the theme. \nYou say you have been reading about it.  That would infer you know how to read.  And type.  And google.  You should consult this thing know as the World Wide Web before asking here.  There are hundreds of tutorials on how to install burg, or the themes, or what burg even is.  Sorry chap, but your supposed to do your research first, ask questions later.\n\nA: BURG stands for Brand-new Universal loadeR from GRUB. It’s based on GRUB and adds features like new object format and configurable menu system.\nChange of GRUB to BURG\n\nFor Ubuntu, we first add repositories:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/burg\n\nWe update database\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd install the package BURG\nsudo apt-get install burg burg-themes\n\nOnce installed, we will have to answer some questions of settings, such as where to install it. It is important to install it on the same partition where we have installed our operating system. Otherwise, we could do that any other system could not start.\n\nSelect the installation disk,It is usually in /dev/sda  (the first hard disk).If not sure of where to install it, do not do, looking for information.\nto install it in /dev/sda run\nsudo burg-install /dev/sda\n\nand finally update with\nsudo update-burg\n\nBefore rebooting we can emulate the system startup screen and configure the bootloader as you wish using the following command:\nsudo burg-emu\n\nIf we find a theme that you like, we can install more with Grub Customizer. To install it in terminal type the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nYou can configure new options, such as the background or add graphic elements, from the tab \"Appereance settings\". Also we will allow download new themes.\nIf, for the reason that we want to use GRUB 2, we just have to open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge burg burg-themes\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:n-muench/burg\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: No such file or directory error on DD commands I'm trying to run DD commands to fix a cell phone issue in Ubuntu 14.04.

Personally, like most people I just use sudo in front of the DD command, but the official DD documentation advises against the use of sudo with DD, because under certain circumstances sudo can be interrupted.

From what I understand, if e.g. a package called \"expack\" is listed here then if another .deb file depends on expack it will not need to install it (if I do apt-get). But if I do apt-cache show expack then it will not show that it's installed. So how do I check that the 'expack' dependency is installed (without using a specific package that depends on 'expack', just using only the argument 'expack') ?\n\nA: Here's the answer:\napt-cache showpkg expack\n\nSource: Commrent below by Xu-Wang \nAlso, the whereis command works in most cases to show these packages and their path or location as well.\nwhereis expack\n\nhere's the output:\nexpack: /usr/games/expack /usr/share/man/man1/expack.1.gz\n\nThis shows that expack is installed and the location is \"/usr/games/expack\" .\nAlso, packages that are typically provided by other packages in virtual packages will typically show using the apt-cache search command\napt-cache search expack\n\nhere's the output \nexult-studio - tools for editing and viewing exult games\n\nSo, exult-studio provides expack and satisfies the dependency expack according to http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html (see 7.5 virtual packages) \nwhere expack = bar and exult-studio = bar-plus. \nTo see a list of a packages dependencies and to also see if the dependencies are already installed, use the application apt-rdepends\nsudo apt-get apt-rdepends\n\nTo list dependencies and status of all dependencies as well use apt-rdepends -p \napt-rdepends -p packagename \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu booting with KDE problem I have deleted KDE from my ubuntu 14.04.

I am unable to see anything, so can't change anything graphically. I am able to login in TTY1.\nI have used the below command to install and uninstall the KDE desktop:\nInstall: \nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nUninstall: \nsudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: It sounds to me like when you installed KDE you let it switch your default Desktop Manager from LightDM to KDM. KDM would have been removed when you uninstalled KDE, because of this you get a black screen at bootup. You will need to switch back to LightDM as your default Desktop Manager.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal type \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\".\n\n*In terminal type \"sudo reboot\".\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have LightDM installed for some reason then you can install it by typing in terminal \"sudo apt-get install lightdm\".\n\n\n\nEDIT #1:\nIn response to your edit regarding how you installed/removed KDE I believe the problem was that you used aptitude when removing instead of apt-get remove. Aptitude removes packages using a list generated during the install but you didn't use aptitude during the install, apt doesn't use a pre-generated list. It's likely something you need got accidentally removed because of this. I would suggest installing lightdm & ubuntu-desktop again as this will re-install any missing dependencies. In terminal type sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop and then sudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm.\n\nA: You're in luck. tty1 IS a recovery environment.\nFirst, try to start an xsession to see if the problem is related to X11. To do this, sign in on tty1 with your username and password, then type in the following command\nstartx\n\nthis should start an xsession on tty7 (CTRL + ALT + F7) and should automatically take you there if launch of the xsession is successfull. You can see the output of any errors on tty1 (CTRL + ALT + F1)\nIf you are talking about the \"splash screen\" (blue screen that says Kubuntu with the dots under that light up) it has nothing to do with KDE and is a separate screen saver like program called plymouth that only serves the purpose of looking cool.\nTo view a text output and to see errors that take place during this process press F2 when the splash screen is displayed.\nStarting with 14.04, Kubuntu now uses lightdm and may still be configured to use the kde defaults.

After that I have upgraded my Ubuntu as 14.04 32 bit and It was working properly.\n2/3 days ago I needed to install Windows again as it was affected by virus. This time I installed Windows 8 Pro 32 bit in my hard disk. But after installing the Windows 8, I can't see the dual boot menu from which I can go for Ubuntu 14.04 which I had earlier.\nIn this case how can I recover my Ubuntu along with the dual boot menu to use both Ubuntu 14.04 Lts 32 bit & Windows 8 Pro 32 bit together without reinstalling the Ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows 8  will overwrite GRUB boot menu(which is the dual boot screen you are referring to). I believe reinstalling GRUB through windows will fix your problem. Another fix would be simply to reinstall Ubuntu, in which process you can reinstall GRUB and decide between Windows OS and Ubuntu. It is possible to retain your previous Ubuntu files this way. I would first try installing GRUB boot menu and making sure it is installed on the root of the first partition. I am not an expert but I believe this will solve your problem. \n\nA: Since you reinstalled windows , GRUB boot menu would have disapeared ,You can get it back , Just follow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your system with live Ubuntu Disc\n\n*Once you boot into your Ubuntu , open terminal and type the following.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair- trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n\n*This will install and start Boot-Repair.\n\n*Select \"Recommended Repair\"\n\n*Let it complete and Reboot once the process is complete.On your reboot , you will see GRUB boot menu appear with Windows as well as Ubuntu.\nFor more information click here.\n", "Q: Would like to use different passwords for initial login and sudo for encrypted home folder I just encrypted my home directory using ecryptfs and the instructions from How to Encrypt Ubuntu Home Folder After Installation.\nIn order to really benefit from the encryption, however, I needed to change to a stronger and longer password for login. Typing in a long password once at login doesn't bother me, but it does get annoying to have to type in such a long password every time I use sudo.\nHow can I set my account to use two passwords: a strong long password for login and a weaker shorter password for sudo (with an ecryptfs encrypted home folder)?\n\nA: You can completely remove the need to enter a password for sudo: How to run sudo command with no password?\nI don't see any other way though, it's either entering the same sudo password or removing it.\nI have a long password (about 20 characters) and it doesn't bother me. Also, entering a few sudo commands in succession only requires you to type the password once...\nIt doesn't bother me because my password is easy to type fast. Lots of people make a password too complicated, either to remember or to type. Personally I think this is wrong. If you have a long password that is easy to type, people can't follow your keystrokes when they're watching. If you do have a complicated password that takes time to type. There is lots to be said about passwords and they're never-ending discussions. I'm personally convinced that it's better to use a long password (even using normal dictionary words, including spaces and other punctuation) than a complicated short password. The longer the password, the longer (exponentially) it takes to crack. Using common sentences (e.g. I had bacon and eggs for breakfast.), makes it easy to remember, very strong but also easy and fast to type. You will find people who strongly object because they're all dictionary words, but I can assure you they're more difficult to crack than e.g. P@5s\\/\\/0Rd, which is considered by most as a very strong password.\n", "Q: Printer status is not updating, so it won't print after update to Ubuntu 14.04 Ubuntu 14.04 64bit (upgraded from 12.04), Samsung ML-2015 (ML-2010).

However, I strongly believe that for the purpose of only listing running programs and information about them, xprop and qdbus are two sufficient tools and installing xdotool and wmctrl unless the user wants those for additional functionality - is a purposeless task. In this answer I would like to present two scripting solutions with xprop and qdbus.\nNote that I am by no means against xdotool or wmctrl.

I walked through the same steps, and got 5.1 channel sound selected, but when trying to play videos without pavucontrol open the videos would freeze and the AV receiver would show intermittent signal being received.  Leaving pavucontrol open did indeed enable playback of any video, through mplayer, VLC, or XBMC.\nTrying the pacmd command in startup applications, however, did not solve the problem.  Neither the example given nor any relevant variation worked, and I'd welcome input on configuring that command.\nUltimately what I did was simply add pavucontrol to the startup applications and leave it running in the background or minimised while using XBMC or other playback utilities.  Not elegant, but effective, especially since no future user can accidentally forget to run pavucontrol before trying to play a file.\n\nA: This wasn't working for me in Ubuntu 20.04.1 (Focal Fossa) until I configured /etc/pulse/daemon.conf and changed\n; default-sample-rate = 44100 \n\nto\n default-sample-rate = 48000\n\nDon't forget this step! :)\n\nA: I eventually had luck by doing the weirdest thing.  Leaving pavucontrol up.  That's right - I just don't close it.  As long as I select one of the two Digital Surround 5.1 profile options (one includes Analog input) under the built-in audio section under the configuration tab of pavucontrol then DON'T CLOSE that app, I get working 5.1 audio in all other programs.  If I close it, I go back to wonky issues including my receiver freaking out trying to decode whatever my computer is outputting and not knowing what to do.\n\nA: I too have been battling with the issue of the software encoded AC3 SPDIF output getting disabled and having to use pavucontrol to set it back since 14.04 (I'm on 18.04 and had the same issues until now.)\nYour issues may be PulseAudio auto-detecting attached devices and changing to them (in my case, auto detecting and then changing to the HDMI audio output.)  If you think this might be causing these issues then in \n/etc/pulse/default.pa \n\ncomment out\n#load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nand\n#load-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nI'm so very glad to finally be able to nail this annoying issue properly on the head!\n", "Q: How to move icons on Kubuntu? I'm new to Linux world. Recently I've installed Kubuntu and I don't know how to move icons on the desktop. When I drag an icon from applications (start menu) and drop it, I can't move it anymore. For example, if I drop it in the middle of desktop, I can't drag it to left corner. Seems like icons are locked. What should I do?\n\nA: Right Click at the Desktop, Unlock Widgets. Or Lock Widgets, and then Unlock Widgets back again. \nThen Pull not by the icon itself but by its little horizontal panel. \nSee at the picture:\n\n\nA: Right click on Desktop.\nSelect \"Enter edit mode\".\nNow you can move or resize the icons as you wish.\nAfter you moved your icons, exit edit mode.\n", "Q: Error occured when apt-get update run I tried to run sudo apt-get update on Ubuntu Gnome 14.04. \nAnd here is result:\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty InRelease                                                             \n\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty InRelease                                                             \n\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty InRelease                                                             \n\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty InRelease            \n\nErr http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty InRelease            \n\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/fossfreedom/packagefixes/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/gilir/lubuntu/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/kilian/f.lux/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/shutter/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-on-rails/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/sublime-text-3/ubuntu/dists/trusty/InRelease  \n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/cassou/emacs/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/chris-lea/node.js/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/diesch/testing/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/fossfreedom/packagefixes/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/gilir/lubuntu/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/kilian/f.lux/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/shutter/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-on-rails/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/sublime-text-3/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Unable to connect to ppa.launchpad.net:http:\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/dists/trusty/Release.gpg  Cannot initiate the connection to archive.canonical.com:80 (2001:67c:1360:8c01::1b). - connect (101: Network is unreachable) [IP: 2001:67c:1360:8c01::1b 80]\n\nW: Some index files failed to download.

Coming from a Windows 7 on a laptop with an integrated graphics card (Intel HD 3000 I think) as well as an Nvidia GT540M, I was accustomed to being able to change things like saturation and gamma of either my laptop screen or my two Dell monitors (one is on VGA, one is on HDMI) from the Intel Graphics Control Panel.\nOne of my two Dell S2340L monitors (the one that was on HDMI) was a lot less saturated than the one on VGA, which I solved by changing the color range of the HDMI one to full and checking the YCbCr checkbox for that one in the Intel Graphics Control Panel.\nHowever, in Ubuntu, I cannot seem to find a program where one can adjust settings like saturation and color range for monitors.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*GNOME Color Manager (The one in Ubuntu settings.

I had previously removed the Mac OS X from it as it was having issues so I formatted the whole HD and had Windows 7 running on it without troubles (bootcamp 4, 5, 5.1).\nI ended up making a mistake and wiping everything during the installation of the Ubuntu partition (after shrinking the Windows one and partitioning it... I didn't realize that the \"Erase and Install Ubuntu\" toggle performed the erase IMMEDIATELY!)\nAfter installing successfully Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit I installed Windows 7 in the remaining unpartitioned space. Once done so upon boot the computer boots only in W7 and the Startup Manager accessed from holding the alt / option key upon booting only recognizes the presence of one hard drive and not the various bootable partition. When clicked it will simply boot in Windows.\nNow I understand this is because windows does not recognize ext4 and that I should boot in the linux (GRUB?) partition as it can deal with both ext4 and NTFS, however the Startup Manager also doesn't recognize the two boot partitions which means I am stuck booting in windows 7 at this moment.\nThis guides states I would need to get Ubuntu to EFI-boot using rEFInd which would be installed through the Mac partition, though the article says it was a necessary thing for 32-bit; is it still for 64-bit as it was running great?\nWhat would you recommend doing to achieve the dual boot? Should I install a temp version of OSX to follow the guide? \nThese were the partitions I made when installing Ubuntu, do I need other ones?\n\n\n*\n\n*A reserved for bios 1 MB\n\n*swap 6 GB\n\n*/ 100 GB ext4\n\n*/media/shared 30 GB fat32 (there was no ntfs in the list strangely enough)\n\n*The rest was left unpartitioned\n\n\nI didn't make a /home partition.\nThe installation went perfectly for Ubuntu. It started up wonderfully and working great. I proceeded to install windows and had to create the windows partition in the shared partition by extending it to 300 GB because it wouldn't allow me to create one in the remaining free allocated space (commands grayed out)\n\nA: You might want to try out this software EasyBCD on windows. Its a recommendation only but it helped me when I faced the same situation as yours.\nAfter that you might want to run boot - repair when you get to boot in Ubuntu and then remove EasyBCD.\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\n*\n\n*Download EasyBCD from here\n\n\n*Install EasyBCD in your Windows Partition.\n\n\n*Now, run EasyBCD as an administrator.\n\n\n*Next, click on \"Add New Entry\".\n\n\n\n*Next, Click on 'Linux/BSD\" under \"Operating Systems\" then select \"GRUB 2\" under \"Type:\", type a name according to your choice and click \"Add Entry\".\n\n\n\n*Now, click on \"Edit Boot Menu\".\n\n\n\n*Now, according to your OS priority select your OS and press the up button and set it \"Default - Yes\" by ticking in the appropriate box.\n\nAnd finally \"Save Settings\" and reboot.

I set up a password and I installed it.\nThe installation blocked itself almost at end, and by rebooting via USB i noticed that the HDD was formatted and there was just the /boot and the / (my LUKS LVM was formatted and replaced with those two partitions)\nI have\n\n\n*\n\n*The disk itself\n\n*The dd image of the disk after the disaster (a 1TB img)\n\n*The passphrase to unlock both the LVM: the oldest one (which I want to recover) and the newest one (to unlock the root partition)\n\n\nQuestion\nHow can I recover my precious data?\n\nA: You are not guaranteed that you will recover all your files. If you have anything precious in deleted files then the next worth giving it a try.\nYou are recommended to unmount this partiton frist. Yoo are not recommended to write on partition any more in order to keep data chains at the drive as they are. In other words avoid overwriting. Stop using this drive immediately!\nBoot from Live CD or even better from the different drive with installed OS.\nThen you should run the software which find and recovers files/data from your physical storage. It is possible still although Operating Systems can not see deleted files due to their references were deleted from File Table, or File Table was corrupted.\nScalpel\nThis is a filesystem-independent recovery tool for Linux. The latest version is 2.0. Install it in Ubuntu with\nsudo apt-get install scalpel\n\nNext is some text editing — the configuration file is /etc/scalpel/scalpel.conf. You will find that everything has been commented out — uncomment the specific file format that you want to recover. For example, if I want to recover a deleted zip file, I will uncomment the .zip file section in scalpel.conf\nNext, in a terminal, run:\nsudo scalpel  [device/directory/file name] -o [output directory]\n\nThe output directory, in which you want to store recovered files, should be empty before running Scalpel; otherwise, you will get an error.\nPhotorec\nThis is the fastest utility of the three. It’s installed by the testdisk utility package. If you don’t want to mess with the command-line, this is the best utility for you. Just run photorecas the root user in a terminal, and you will see a nice ncurses-based UI.\nSelect the device to search, and it will ask you for the partition table type. Select yours; in my case, it’s Intel. Next, you have to select the filesystem or partition of the device disk. Next, it prompts you to choose the file system.\nLast, it will ask for an output folder in which to store recovered files. After making a selection, press y to proceed.\nNote: The above utilities will not recover replaced files, because in the case of replacement you are replacing the inode itself, so it’s not possible to recover it.\n\nA: Unfortunately, per man cryptsetup\n\n“LUKS header: If the header of a LUKS volume gets damaged, all data is permanently lost unless you have a header-backup. If a key-slot is damaged, it can only be restored from a header-backup or if another active key-slot with known passphrase is undamaged. Damaging the LUKS header is something people manage to do with surprising frequency. This risk is the result of a trade-off between security and safety, as LUKS is designed for fast and secure wiping by just overwriting header and key-slot area.”\n\nAnd per your comment (11 hours ago),\n\nThanks for your answer! Unfortunatly no, I haven't. I don't have a back-up of the key nor the one of the LUKS header.\n\nI think your disks have been (effectively) securely erased; that is the sectors are (at least in theory) indistinguishable from random data.\n\nA: You could try gpart (note: not gparted!), it can guess the boundaries of lost partitions.\ngpart saved me once in a similar situation, although my partitions were not encrypted.

I've got through all the questions related to that on AskUbuntu but I haven't found a working solution probably because I did a big mess with Wine (tried to compile/install it in many ways, winetricks won't work until I use ent WINE=\"path\" winetricks, etc).\nI would like to make a cleanup of everything that's related to Wine (and its components like winetricks) and perform a clean install. I tried to install Wine through the Software Center but there's only an old version of Wine, then I uninstalled it with Software Center as well. Then I used this tutorial to compile Wine: http://www.noobslab.com/2014/05/winehq-updated-to-version-1719-install.html - I compiled it in \"/home/kamil/Pobrane/wine-1.7.19\" but it made a 64-bit version of Wine.

Is there a command that you can run in a shell script that would detect if the CD tray is open or closed, and return 1 or 0 depending on whether it was (or something easy to interpret)?\nCurrently, I am executing the open command, and timing how long it takes to execute. If it is almost instant, it is open. If it takes time, it was open and is now closed.\nI would like a method that doesn't involve changing the current state - just detecting it.\n\nA: Based on @terdon's C code, I wrote a version in Python:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport os, fcntl, CDROM, sys\n\ndef drive_status(drive):\n  fd = os.open(drive, os.O_RDONLY | os.O_NONBLOCK)\n  rv = fcntl.ioctl(fd, CDROM.CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS)\n  os.close(fd)\n  return rv\n\nsys.exit(drive_status(sys.argv[1]) != CDROM.CDS_TRAY_OPEN)\n\nClearly, it could use some love for comments and cmdline argument handling, but if you need a Python version... this will work.\nAlso note that the CDROM module may be Linux-specific, and that not all drives support querying (eg. the ioctl() will return CDS_NO_INFO).\nThere are other CDROM.CDS_* constants that provide helpful variants. In particular, CDS_DISK_OK will tell you if the tray is closed and has a disk present.\n\nA: I found a nice little solution here.

This has occurred to me on at least one or two occasions, where after applying updates and rebooting, the firewall configuration was blocking me gaining access to the server.

The command you use to reboot is the problem: don't do reboot now, do reboot or shutdown -r now to reboot your system.\nThe command syntax (since 13.04) has been:\nreboot [OPTION]...  [REBOOTCOMMAND]\n\nThe REBOOTCOMMAND never existed before. In 12.04, your now was just ignored but now it's being used... And it's breaking everything.\nLong answer, with my tests results and explanation:\nI have a similar problem with some servers running 14.04 AND in VPS (hosted at the French OVH provider - running OpenVZ) AND when doing reboot now inside the server itself.\nLike you I've issued the command reboot now from the console (logged in using SSH). A few second after I pressed RETURN, my session is automatically disconnected.\nLike you I've never been able to reconnect to the server via SSH after issuing this command.\nSo, I decided to open the KVM console provided by OVH. (emulating the direct access using keyboard and screen on a physical server for this kind of virtual server).\nI was able to connect to my machine and I saw that she was entering into Single User Mode, waiting for me to press CTRL+D to continue or to enter the root password to go into maintenance mode.\nI pressed the key combination to go let the process continue and then was able to SSH into my system again. What was my surpise to see, after running uptime, that the uptime was not 2 or 3 minutes but yet a lot of day : reboot now executed inside an Ubuntu 14.04 VPS is not really rebooting but is just asking to go into Single User mode!\nFrom this, I've learned to never ask a reboot from within my VPS but to request it from the command provided on the management interface of the hoster.\nThus there is no problem with your SSH installation. The problem is when you type reboot now. In fact, I tested it afterward also, if you had typed reboot (just the word, no option), it would have done what you were intending to do : reboot the server.\nUsing reboot with an argument (from the man page) call the command shutdown with the given arguments.\nAnd indeed, if I execute shutdown now, I have the same behaviour : the system is not rebooted, it goes into single user mode.\nRemark: it looks like it is the intended behaviour as the message appearing on the screen after hiting executing this command says something like :\n\nThe system will be brought to the maintenance mode\n\nMaintenance mode or single user mode, this represent the same, a runlevel with noting more than a shell, no network, no network processes, ...\nThis may be confusing, but note that the correct usage of shutdown is, for instance : shutdown -h now to halt the system now or shutdown -r now to reboot it now.\nI wasn't aware that shutdown now would only bring the system into single user mode. I usually do init S to achieve this.\n\nA: For my system the problem was that the ssh init script /etc/init.d/ssh was the only one checking for the presence of the upstart version of init.\nSo /etc/init.d/ssh doesn't start ssh, because it believes it will be started by upstart.\nIn my case, upstart doesn't start because of my particular configuration:\nThere was a correct configuration in /etc/init/ssh.conf, but there also was an /etc/init/ssh.override file containing manual, which means ssh is expected to be started manually. \nThis file was created by the get-remnux.sh installation script.\nStarting manually, or removing the /etc/init/ssh.override file solves the problem.\n", "Q: Graphics card issues?

I wanted to play Halo CE but there were screen issues. My frind said it had something to do with the catalyst GPU drivers not being up to date. So any ideas on how to find out my catalyst GPU type? (HP Pavilion g6).\nAll help is much appreciated!\n\nA: I think that the catalyst GPU is AMD. According to the output of lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 VGA you have no AMD GPU, and so your computer is already using the right graphics driver, the graphics driver that is built-in in Ubuntu.\nSome models of the HP Pavilion g6 laptop have an additional discrete graphics processor and other models of the HP Pavilion g6 don't have one. For example, according to HP Pavilion g6-1304tx Notebook PC Product Specifications, that model of HP Pavilion g6 laptop, which has a 2nd Generation Intel Core i5 processor, does indeed also have an AMD Radeon HD 7450M graphics processor. If so, the correct graphics driver for that graphics processor would surely show up in the Additional Drivers utility. Search the Dash for Additional Drivers and click the Additional Drivers icon to open Additional Drivers to check if there is a proprietary graphics driver available for your laptop. \n", "Q: Problems installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 I'm attempting to install Ubuntu from a live USB, however it gives me the following error: \n\nerror installing\n  /cdrom//pool/main/c/console-setup/console-setup-linux_1.88_all.c \n  trying to overwrite '/etc/console-setup/compose.ISo-8859-13.inc',\n  which is also in package console-setup 1.88.\n\nI have already tried to recreate the live USB.

It runs perfectly in any way I run it from the terminal or from a launcher or whatever you can think of. \nWhat the script actually does is nothing more than get the get the current settings:\ngsettings get com.canonical.indicator.sound interested-media-players\n\nedit the list, and set the changed list by:\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.sound interested-media-players \"['newlist']\"\n\nThese commands are executed by a python script,. However, when run from a cronjob (crontab -e) only the gsettings - get - part works, but not the gsettings - set - section. That the get section works fine with cron, I checked by making the script write data (the original as well as the edited) to an external file.\nNot a python problem\nTo see if the problem is related to python code, I created a bash script that applies a changed sound menu items list. The story is the same: the bash script runs fine from the command line or a launcher, not from cron, while any other command in the same script would run fine.\nAlso, if I add any command at the end of the script below, it works fine and it looks like the script is satisfied with its own work.\nWhy is the gsettings set command not working when initiated from cron?\nThis is the script:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport subprocess\n\ndef read_soundmenu():\n    # read the current launcher contents\n    get_menuitems = subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", \"com.canonical.indicator.sound\", \"interested-media-players\"\n        ], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    return eval((get_menuitems.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\")))\n\ndef set_current_menu(current_list): # this takes no effect from cron\n    # preparing subprocess command string\n    current_list = str(current_list).replace(\", \", \",\")\n    subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", \"com.canonical.indicator.sound\", \"interested-media-players\",\n        current_list,\n        ])\n\ncurrent_list = read_soundmenu()\nfor item in current_list:\n    if item == \"vlc.desktop\":\n        current_list.remove(item)\nset_current_menu(current_list)\n\n\nA: The solution\nIt turned out the blind spot was a hole in my knowledge. The reason for not running specific commands in the python script (gsettings set) was because cron uses a very restricted set of environment variables.\nTo run a gsettings *set* command from cron (in general), it takes more than just running it from your personal cron file; the environment variable DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is needed for correct execution. \nFor reasons of convenience and flexibility, I solved it, inspired by- and based on the information in this post on stack overflow, by creating an \"intermediate\" script that both exports the variable and calls the actual script. The actual script edits gsettings. Since (normally) a process inherits the environment of its parent, now the script runs fine.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPID=$(pgrep gnome-session)\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-);/path/to/script.py\n\n(assuming script.py is executable)\nIncluding the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS variable in a python script\nTo make editing gsettings possible by a python script, run by cron (and make an intermediate script unnecessary) the function below could be included in the script. It should be called before the gsettings set function in the script.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndef set_envir():\n    pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"gnome-session\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    cmd = \"grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/\"+pid+\"/environ|cut -d= -f2-\"\n    os.environ[\"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\"] = subprocess.check_output(\n        ['/bin/bash', '-c', cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().replace(\"\\0\", \"\")\n\n", "Q: How to run a custom command for any X session I need to patch the gamma on my monitor that is really out of balance, in short I need to run a command like xgamma -gamma 1.2 for any X session that I might start on my machine.\nMy problem is that Ubuntu uses a different startup technology ( upstart ) and I'm not sure where I'm supposed to write this command for my X sessions.\nKeep in mind that I need to run this only if an X sessions starts, not everytime at the boot.\n\nA: This will run the command on session starting (after login), I think this is the simplest way.\nCreate a .desktop file in /etc/xdg/autostart/:\nsudo gedit /etc/xdg/autostart/mygamma.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=My Gamma\nExec=/usr/bin/xgamma -gamma 1.2\nNoDisplay=true\nStartupNotify=false\nTerminal=false\n\n", "Q: Every time ubuntu need usb drive to run I am new to the Ubuntu.\nI have installed the ubuntu 12.04 from the usb drive.

I also have good experience with Linux. I need some help on how to recover the lost app windows.\nI have been quite impressed by Ubuntu Desktop so far until I run into this problem. I use Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop on a Toshiba laptop with an external monitor. I use Chrome browser and Terminal apps frequently to develop software. I need to keep these app windows open for several days. I put the laptop into sleep mode between work sessions.\nI often find some open windows are lost after waking up the laptop from the sleep mode. For example, I use Chrome browser to research topics. After waking up the laptop, I cannot find the Chrome window anymore. I can open a new Chrome window from the Chrome icon on the launcher. After that, if I click the Chrome icon on the launcher again, I can see both Chrome windows. But I cannot choose the old one.\nThis happens to both Chrome and Terminal apps so far. Can someone give me pointers on what I might have done wrong? Thanks.\n\nA: I don't think you're doing anything wrong that may cause this problem.\nUbuntu 14.04 uses the relatively new Unity user interface that a still has a few rough edges, as well as a more recent Linux kernel (3.13+).\nMany of us are having a series of issues:\n14.04: password not accepted after computer wakes up from sleep\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/1299778\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/1280300\nFrom time to time Chrome has also crashed for me (you should see an Apport dialog showing up when that happens), especially after waking up the computer.\nTry searching Ubuntu bugs in Launchpad and if nothing like your problem shows up for 14.04, consider filing a new bug report. This is your best shot at getting the issue fixed.\n", "Q: How do I get Adobe Reader to work in Ubuntu 14.04? I downloaded Adobe Reader from here:\nhttp://get.adobe.com/reader/\nBy default, it recognizes my system as Linux and lets me download a .bin file which turns out to be an executable installer.\nThere are no installation instructions at all (shame on Adobe) but it was pretty easy to figure out I had to add execution permissions to the file and run it as root.

How does Enigmail acquire the public key for someone who sends you an encrypted email? Do you have to import it yourself or does it get the key from a keyserver?\n\nA: The key is (usually) written into the message headers. But this (encrypted) mail does not contain any information on the sender, if it isn't signed. Let's analyze what is contained in an OpenPGP messages.\nDecomposing an Encrypted OpenPGP Message\nYou can see this if you list the packets contained in an encrypted message:\n$ echo foo | gpg --encrypt --recipient 0xa4ff2279 | gpg --list-packets\n\nThe output starts with the \"publicly\" visible, unencrypted headers, which contain the subkey the message is encrypted for:\n:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 1, keyid CC73B287A4388025\n    data: [4092 bits]\n\nAfter entering the passphrase, GnuPG will also print the remaining packets:\n:encrypted data packet:\n    length: 63\n    mdc_method: 2\ngpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID A4388025, created 2014-03-26\n      \"Jens Erat (born 1988-01-19 in Stuttgart, Germany)\"\n:compressed packet: algo=2\n:literal data packet:\n    mode b (62), created 1402861918, name=\"\",\n    raw data: 4 bytes\n\nDecomposing a Signed OpenPGP Message\nA signed message contains the signing (sub)key ID of the sender, see the :signature packet line (fourth packet).\n$ echo foo | gpg --sign | gpg --list-packets\n\n(GnuPG asks for password, for signing)\n:compressed packet: algo=1\n:onepass_sig packet: keyid 8E78E44DFB1B55E9\n    version 3, sigclass 0x00, digest 2, pubkey 1, last=1\n:literal data packet:\n    mode b (62), created 1402862406, name=\"\",\n    raw data: 4 bytes\n:signature packet: algo 1, keyid 8E78E44DFB1B55E9\n    version 4, created 1402862406, md5len 0, sigclass 0x00\n    digest algo 2, begin of digest 9a d2\n    hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2014-06-15)\n    subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 8E78E44DFB1B55E9)\n    data: [4095 bits]\n\nAn encrypted OpenPGP message could of course also be signed. I'm leaving composing the commands for verifying this as exercise to the interested reader.\nObtaining the Public Keys\nUsing the key ID obtained from the signed message, one can fetch the key from the key servers. Most mail clients (plugins) will do this automatically for you:\n$ gpg --recv-keys 0x8E78E44DFB1B55E9\ngpg: requesting key FB1B55E9 from hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net\ngpg: key A4FF2279: \"Jens Erat (born 1988-01-19 in Stuttgart, Germany)\" not changed\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:              unchanged: 1\n\nIf the message isn't signed, you (or your OpenPGP client) might search the key servers for the mail address of the other. Result is the same, you still cannot be sure about the validity of that key.\n\nA: So, I took a more direct route to finding out about this question.  Enigmail has a nice website, and a good handbook which explains a great deal about it's operation for a casual user like me, who likes encryption but gets lost in the coding.\nIn section 8 of the HTML version of the handbook, Enigmail requires the use of a the recipient's public key to encrypt the message for them to read.  If you don't already have their public key, then apparently it might be able to find a public key on a keyserver.  This is covered in section 7 of the handbook.\n", "Q: Accepting a host key on the device and the workstation I am trying to install the Ubuntu touch on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus running android 4.3.

The GameoverZeus (P2PZeus) malware, and associated Cryptolocker, has been blocked temporarily, but may resume its potency.  Windows is said to be vulnerable to it, but not Linux.  So is Ubuntu under WUBI safe or not?\n\nA: Wubi boots Ubuntu. So with regard to viruses there is no difference between Wubi and running a normal dual boot with Ubuntu/Windows. You are not going to get infected while running Ubuntu using Wubi.\nOf course if your Windows is already infected then every time you boot Windows there is a risk it encrypts the Wubi root.disk (the virtual disk Wubi uses) or other files required to boot Wubi, in which case you'd no longer be able to boot Ubuntu anymore. This wouldn't happen on a normal dual boot.\nThe answer is to make sure your Windows is clean.

Without specifying '--enable-shared', the library was never found.\n\n*Specify the location of the 'lib' and 'include' files generated by the x264 make process like this :-\n./configure --extra-ldflags=\"-L/path/to/extra/lib\" --extra-cflags=\"-I/path/to/extra/includes\" --enable-x264 ..etc  ..etc\nI have now successfully compiled libav, with x264 support, and have the following binaries :-\navconv, avplay, avprobe, avserver, ffmpeg.\nOff course I am sure if I had just installed libav using apt-get I would have saved myself a lot of trouble, but as this was a learning process I think I have learned a lot.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have audio output source switch automatically with Xonar DG?

I'm trying to run a bunch of scripts related to a gaming server in Terminator. The only problem is when I do this, Terminator detects all my CPU cores and the PC lags. Is there any way to start it up but trick it into thinking I only have 1 CPU core?\n\nA: Though another answer has already given the literal answer I would explore the possibility this is not being done the right way. Instead you should run a script which you do not want to slow down the computer (such as non interactive scripts) using the nice command.\nTo do this simply prefix the command you wish to run with nice, for example:\n\nnice command_to_run\n\nThis will cause the program to be de-prioritized below other tasks and will not slow down your machine. I often use this technique when doing a long compile which would otherwise slow down my PC to a crawl, this has the advantage of allowing the program to use all cores when the machine is not busy but will quickly stop it using them when you run something else.\n\nA: It is not terminator that is doing the \"spreading\" on all the CPU of a given process. Linux itself (the kernel) is doing this. A task (process) is scheduled as available to run on all CPUs by defaults; if it uses threads it can uses more than one CPU at a time. \nTo restrict a process to a specific CPU, you use the command taskset. \ntaskset --cpu-list 1,2 my_command \n\nThis command forces my_command to run just on CPUs #1 or #2. \nTo learn more, type man taskset or search for \"linux CPU affinity\" (first hit here). \n", "Q: Setup Windows and Linux, dual boot and a storage folder that can be written and read by both I have just setup Windows 8 + Ubuntu 14.04 on dual boot on my laptop. Now I'd like to have a common storage \"partition\" where I store personal documents, movies, music, etc that can be read and written to by windows and ubuntu.\nDoing some research, I came across this article which basically tells you to create a NTFS partition for storage, then edit the fstab file in Ubuntu and edit Libraries in Windows. That sounds cool because I don't have to install any third party for this but the little problem I see with this article is that it's really old, written in 2010, so I'm thinking if something has changed and there's better, more recommended ways to do that nowadays in 2014.\n\nA: You can still set it up like the article suggests in 14.04, the permissions have to be set correctly in both OS's.\nOne very easy way to handle this is to use the GUI in 14.04 and create a folder in the Desktop directory of your Windows partition.\nMine is located on WinPartition:/users/mylogin/desktop.\nIt is easy, if you have the space on your windows install.\nOptionally, pick a neutral partition, set up the folder from Ubuntu, open all permissions and then create a shortcut to the folder in Windows.\n", "Q: How to keep tor browser bundle updated I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I decided to install the tor browser bundle today. After some quick research online i discovered this article specifically discouraging users from using the Ubuntu packages as they aren't updated. The repo they operate for tor doesn't include the tor browser. So i had to download it manually. I am able to run the tor browser but i'm not able to create a shortcut to it on the launcher or figure out how to ensure i have the latest version. (E.g. apt-get update/upgrade) \nSo my question is this: Since the tor browser is a manual download, and not from a package repo, how do i ensure it stays up to date? Will the bundle check online each time its run? Or is it up to me now to check the Tor site often to ensure i have the latest version. I'm just curious how others are dealing with this issue. \n\nA: You could use the Tor browser PPA that webupd8 maintains, of course you don't get any warranty using a third party repository.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/tor-browser\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tor-browser\n\n", "Q: Weird launcher bar/chrome bug, hard to describe I have Chrome locked to the launcher, but when I click it, it opens another icon on the launcher. When I hover over it, it says the name of one of my bookmarks. I've unlocked and locked to no avail. Screenshot here. The first Chrome icon on launcher just says Google Chrome when hovered over. In the screenshot, it still says the bookmark, so it's not changing according to what page I have open (which is ask ubuntu in the screen) I want to make the Chrome icon launch normally again. Thanks for any help.\n\nA: I just solved this problem with my Chrome.\nGo to ~/.local/share/applications/ there will probably be a file named google-chrome-stable.desktop. If there's not try grep -i 'one world from your bookmark name' and it should return the file containing this false launcher. \nInside this file should be a line with something like Name=Your bookmark. If so, you are safe to delete it (just in case check if you have /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop on your system, otherwise you won't get any icon)\n\nA: I can't see a screenshot, but I'm on mobile right now so that may not be your fault. \nClose and unlock Chrome from the launcher, reboot, then open Chrome and lock it to the launcher again. That may fix your issue. \n", "Q: Ubuntu '/home' mount point in subfolder of shared partition? I have a dual-boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 machine. Currently, I have one ext4 partition that is being used as my '/home' mount point in Ubuntu, and one NTFS partition that I am using to redirect 'My Documents' and such on Windows. This way both OS's are automatically using these partitions for file storage \"under the hood\".\nMy question is this: is there a reasonable way to make both OS's automatically use the same partition for file storage, without butting heads, and continuing this \"under the hood\" behavior? Preferably I would like to have this partition contain one folder named 'Ubuntu' and another folder named 'Windows', with the 'Ubuntu' folder acting as the mount point for '/home' and the 'Windows' folder containing my redirected profile folders, like in my current setup.\nIs this possible? I'm guessing the format would have to be exFAT or something of the sort. Would there be any downsides (such as speed loss) from using this approach? And if this is not very reasonable, is there another setup that would give similar effects?\nEDIT:\nAlso, would it be reasonable to have a third folder on this partition for my Dropbox files (with each OS's dropbox program pointing to this same folder), so there is only one copy of my dropbox files on my disk?\n\nA: Depends. Not for the whole of /home, if you need Unix-permissions for group. Given the current state of ext driver support in Windows, we would have to use FAT/NTFS for such a common partition, and they don't support Unix permissions. So applications like SSH and GnuPG will have trouble.\nI do it in a bit more complex way: symlink ~/Documents and other such folders to their Windows equivalent on an NTFS partition. Permissions on these folders don't really matter much. Helps if you want to have Dropbox sync them. Of course, none of these are located on the partition containing Windows, but on a separate NTFS partition.\nA better approach will be to change the locations of these folders. From the Arch Wiki, add these to ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs:\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Music\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Pictures\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Videos\"\n\nReplace $HOME/<blah> with your desired location.\nOn my laptop, all such folders are common to both Windows and Debian (and Arch), and I don't face problems, except with Dropbox. Dropbox occasionally replaces perfectly good files with their older versions and says it's a conflicted copy.\nBoth ways require that the partition be automounted. Especially in the case of the XDG variables, the partition needs to be mounted before they're read, or they will reset to $HOME. See How to automount NTFS partitions? for guides on automounting NTFS partitions. The most preferable way to do so is editing /etc/fstab - any other option will mount after the partitions listed in that file are mounted.\n", "Q: Is the compiled version of a binary dynamically linked to the system SSL library? In my case I build nginx from source and I want to confirm whether I need to rebuild it whenever a new OpenSSL update is released. From what I understand either of these two commands can be used to show dynamically linked libraries (with the second being safer):\nldd /path/to/binary_file\nobjdump -p /path/to/binary_file | grep NEEDED\n\nIf I see output like this:\nobjdump -p nginx | grep NEEDED | grep -i ssl\nNEEDED               libssl.so.1.0.0\n\ndoes that mean that OpenSSL is dynamically linked and nginx does not require a rebuild whenever the system copy of the OpenSSL library is upgraded (just a restart)?\nI think the answer is Yes, but I'd just like to get confirmation that is the case.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes that means it is dynamically linked. If the library were statically linked it would have been incorporated into the object code of the binary and ldd/objdump would not show the library name.\n", "Q: No Sound even after fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 x64 I have done everything that I could get off Google to correct the sound problem but none of them is working.

I bought a printer for the first time in my life today, an HP 1515. I eliminated all Microsoft stuff from my computer last year.

However this way of editing tags is unnecessarily slow and repetitive if you are trying to edit the tags of multiple songs that have the same tags in some of their fields. If instead of Rhythmbox you use a music tag editor, you can batch edit the tags of multiple songs in a graphical application that is easier to use than Rhythmbox for editing tags.\nEasyTAG would be a good GUI music tag editor to start with for three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is easy to use.\n\n*You can edit (add or remove) album art.\n\n*You can batch edit the tags of multiple music files.\nEasyTAG writes music metadata in a logical standardized way.

All three of these applications can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: Adding album-art to track metadata\nRhythmbox by itself does not have the ability to add pictures to the track metadata - you have the ability to change metadata such as title, album artist etc for supported file-types such as .mp3 but not covers.\nYou can use other apps like Picard and EasyTAG.\nHowever, you can achieve what you wish straight from Rhythmbox via the CoverArt Browser plugin.\nSo how do I know this?  Well I wrote the plugin...\nLets explain.\nSort out your album covers - you can drag and drop covers onto each album, or search for covers from Google or other internet providers\n\nThen you can embed coverart:\n\nAt the same time you can optionally resize your coverart - for example you may not want a 2Mb cover being embedded in each and every album track!\n\nThis will save the album tracks in the folder location requested and each track in the album will have the coverart embedded in them.\nYou optionally can automatically convert to MP3 format.\nOnce you are happy you can copy back the newly updated tracks over your original tracks - or copy to whatever device/phone that requires your newly updated track covers.\n\nIf you wish to try this out, install the plugin via my PPA using the package sudo apt-get install rhythmbox-plugin-coverart-browser or install manually as described in the linked question & answer\n\n*\n\n*How do I install third-party rhythmbox plugins?\n\n*How to browse by album art in rhythmbox?\n", "Q: eclipse frequent crash I've been using eclipse (the one bundled in ADT) extensively for about a year and had no problems.

After I logged out and back in, the wizard ran again, allowing me to set the various options. After I saved everything, it told me:\nThe function will not be run in future, but you can run\nit yourself as follows:\n  autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install\n  zsh-newuser-install -f\n\nI haven't tried either method myself, but it looks like they will do the job. I don't know what the difference between the two methods is, but I'd guess that the first one will run the next time you log in and that the second one will run immediately.\nThe set-up instructions also mention these, showing the message in an image of the terminal when the set-up is complete.\n", "Q: meaning of *Supports network install?* and *Works \"out of the box\"* What do Supports network install? and Works \"out of the box\" mean in this page:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsDlink\nDoes network install mean that it supports creating a network connection?\n\nA: A \"network install\" is something that an administrator can do from a remote computer, as soon as the physical network card has been placed into the local computer. The advantage then is that the administrator does not have to come round to the local machine to install drivers or other software. This would be useful if a large number of systems in a wide geographic area are to be installed with new hardware.\nFor this, the local computer would then need either a second network card that already works, or the network card would need to \"work out of the box\", meaning: would work without installing additional drivers. (The image is of you taking a brand new network card out of the box that you bought it in, placing it in the machine, and noticing that it works straightaway). In the latter case, it is possible that the network card works well enough to connect to the network, but perhaps not with all available features.\n", "Q: How to remove uninstalled wine app icons from unity dash?

In addition to the selected packages the Okular document viewer was removed, which was running on my computer long before the other packages. Is there any way to prevent those \"side effects\", so that I don't have to reinstall programms again?\n\nA: Okular depended on some or all of the packages your removed. That's why it was removed too. When you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the same time, if you remove a dependency, the parent program is removed too.\n\nPrograms often use some of the same files as each other. Rather than putting these files into each package, a separate package can be installed to provide them for all of the programs that need them. So, to install a program which needs one of these files, the package containing those files must also be installed. When a package depends on another in this way, it is known as a package dependency. By specifying dependencies, packages can be made smaller and simpler, and duplicates of files and programs are mostly removed.\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the same time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be installed, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a package, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed too - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen package to function properly.\n\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\n", "Q: apt-get upgrade not fully installed but is ok, how to remove? We use mariadb with galera. All works well, but every time we upgrade with sudo apt-get upgrade it thinks it fails to upgrade mariadb-server, but it does work fine.

If you don't have a disk you can search online for some programs that can install windows boot loader for you but you have to burn the program on a disk of course.\nUbuntu installs \"grub\". grub won't let you run windows, it lets you go to windows boot loader so that you can run windows.\n\nA: You can also try to reinstall Ubuntu. It will detect your Windows at the installation and proceed with a side by side installation. \nThat process will rewrite the summary of your Hard disk and install grub. You will then be able to boot on Windows by restarting your computer.\nTo manage the grub menu, I can recommend you to install Grub Customizer on Ubuntu (making a search on the internet will lead you to the ppa to install). Once you got it simply run the soft, manage your parameters as you want and then clic \"save\".\nI recommend to keep a small free partition to install Ubuntu in case of malfunction of your Hard Drive.

We run our software from this same MySQL database too, so we'd want good network performance.\n\nA: It is not posible to use one interface for download only and one for upload only.  \n", "Q: How do you back up your Virtual Machine A quick question.  I am running a Windows Server 2008 Virtual Machine on Ubuntu using Virtual Machine Manager.  My question is I want to make regular back up of the Virtual Machine as its very important since the VM is our DC on our network.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: Backing up the .vdi file (virtual disk image) on a regular basis has some major disadvantages. \nFirst: the Backup becomes pretty large, because you cannot do differential backups, meaning, that when something minimal is changed on the disk image (since it is the virtual hard drive it changes all the time) you can't take advantage of saving just the files that changed because it is only one file. You will have to backup the whole image.\nSecond: when the machine is running, while you back it up, you have a high chance of getting an inconsistent backup, because the backup program needs some time to walk through the big image. So you would need to turn off the vm.\nWhat you could do, is to use the snapshot feature of VMs. Then you would only have to backup the snapshots, which are way smaller than the virtual disk image and static. Or you could allow the VM to share a folder on your real hardware like explained here, or even better, use a separate fileserver like e.g. samba, if you have the resources, and then simply use guest-side backup to that folder with any backup program you like, or the built-in backup, that comes with the guest-os.\nThe last would be my favorite, because then you get to use all the features, that a built-in backup system comes with.\n\nA: If you are using virtual machine manager, you will have a \"clone\" option.\nBy right-clicking on the virtual machine's entry, you will see the \"clone\" option.\nAlso, you could backup the virtual machine by copying the virtual machine image.\nThe images are stored by default in /var/lib/libvirt/images/. You will need super user privileges(sudo) to read the data here.\nI would recommend you power off the guest operating system in question before you back it up.\n\nA: Just copy virtual disc files and also vm files on other location. Thats it. You have a backup.\n", "Q: Get keyboard input without requiring root and without x11 I'm trying to capture keyboard input in a C/C++ program without requiring root privileges and without the use of X11 XNextEvent().\nI've tried to open the device directly, but for obvious security reasons, accessing hardware directly requires root permissions. The device I'm trying to open is /dev/input/by-id/(my keyboard name here) which maps to an event pipe(/dev/input/event<#>) that requires root in order to read.\nX11 library allows me to capture keyboard events(using XNextEvent), but I can't rely on the client having X11 installed for cases in which they want to run headless and without the GUI.\nI need to be able to capture all keyboard keys, including the shift, alt, ctrl, and super(windows or mac) key. Preferably, I'd also like to capture media keys such as play, volume up/down, etc and only when the application has focus.\nDoes anyone know how I might be able to do this?\nI've thought of just doing two different code paths for input, one for headless in which they would pull events just using stdin(but this won't catch the shift key AFAIK), and the other path uses X11, but I'd like to only have to maintain one keyboard input system if possible.\n\nA: The best solution I could find is to make a separate daemon that run as service which monitor /dev/input/.. events and let the other user tools to connect to itself and listen for input events.\nThink something that replace XEvent. (bringing those input events to user space)\n", "Q: 12.04 upgrade to 12.10 I am a newbie to Ubuntu and not a techie. I have been working on 12.04 for a while without any problems.

However, my C++ program needs libboost meaning I get errors like this while compiling:\n/4.7/../../../../arm-linux-gnueabi/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system\n-bash: /usr/lib/gcc-cross/arm-linux-gnueabi/4.7/../../../../arm-linux-gnueabi/bin/ld:: No such file or directory\n\nAfter reading some blogs I think that I have to compile libboost for ARM by myself. \nQuestion: \nIs my assumption true? Is there really no precompiled libboost for ARM that can be used with g++-arm-linux-gnueabi to compile for ARM under Ubuntu 32 bit?\n\nA: Ubuntu does have a precompiled Boost library for armhf (I'm assuming the Beagleblack can use armhf). Assuming you'll be using Ubuntu on the Beagleblack, there are two ways you can go about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use pbuilder or sbuild to compile in a chroot of the armhf architecture. This would (generally) require that you have Debian packaging for what you want to compile. However, you could (at least in sbuild) also start an instance of the chroot, use apt-get to get the required libraries, and compile your program in there. pbuider is generally easier to set up.\n\n*Use multiarch to your advantage and install armhf libraries on your computer, so you can compile and use existing libraries without using a chroot. To do this, run sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf, and edit /etc/apt/sources.list to contain deb [arch=armel] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports saucy main universe (if you aren't using Saucy, replace with the appropriate release. Then, run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install libboost-system1.53.0:armhf (or some other Boost package postfixed with :armhf). This will let you have the armhf libraries installed on your system under /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu.\nNote that the second method above will only work for multiarch libraries, which should be most of the libraries in the Ubuntu repo. You may also want to use the second method in a chrooted environment to prevent messing up your system (see here for instructions that use Precise, which is not multiarch-aware).\n", "Q: DJ Software recommendation I am using virtual DJ at my uncle's house but want to use it on Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Netbook.

How can I fix it so that it remembers the brightness from before sleep?\nThis problem occurs when I am using /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight to control the backlight, but the backlight intensity is preserved over a sleep if I use /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0. (But acpi_video0 has other problems—please refrain from suggesting it as a solution)\n\nFurther backstory: I have two directories inside /sys/class/backlight, namely acpi_video0 and intel_backlight. KDE will automatically use acpi_video0 to control the backlight because of its type (firmware, vs raw for intel_backlight). When I allow this to happen, backlight intensity is indeed preserved over a sleep. However, the granularity of the backlight control is too coarse and the leap between 0% and the first non-zero level is too great, so I would like to use intel_video instead.\nSearching for solutions to this, I discovered that this is not intended to be configurable, even though the different controllers act very differently. To get around this, I ended up with the following ugly hack: in /etc/fstab, bind-mount intel_backlight onto acpi_video0. This makes KDE use the intel_backlight controller whether it wants to or not :) However, it now resets the brightness to 100% whenever it wakes up.\n\nHow can I make it remember the backlight intensity over a sleep? If you don't have an answer, but you have any ideas as to how I could debug this at all, I would be very grateful :)\n\nA: One way is to edit /etc/default/grub and in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, add acpi_backlight=vendor, and run sudo update-grub. After you reboot, you should see that /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 disappears and /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight remains. KDE will then use this to control the brightness.\nIf the above doesn't work, you could have a script that saves the value of intel_backlight to a file upon sleep and restores the value on wakeup. Scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d run on suspend/hibernate and thaw/resume.\nNote that you'll need to determine whether you're going to sleep or resuming. $1 contains one of the above four values (suspend, hibernate, thaw, resume), which you can use to determine what to do.\n", "Q: Bash / Python error handling?

Change the shebang to \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nand run it by:\npython3 /path/to/script.py\n\nand it will run fine :)\nExplanation:\nAs hinted in Florian Diesch' comment, input() has changed in Python 3:\nIn Python 2, input() tries to use the input as a Python expression (like eval()), while in Python 3, input() replaces the raw_input() from Python 2.\n\nA: I suggest you raw_input function than input.\ninput([prompt]) -> raw_input([prompt])\n\nEquivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt)).\nThis function does not catch user errors. If the input is not syntactically valid, a SyntaxError will be raised.

For example, consider apache (for which the corresponding user and group is www-data:www-data), I'd do:\nchown $USER:www-data public_html -R\nchmod g+w <relevant folders>\n\nReplace www-data with the plex server's group.

In gedit, how can I write x^2 without using ^? Where 2 will be the superscript of x.\n\nA: gedit can and does support Unicode files. Use the Character Map to obtain Unicode characters. The Character Map isn't part of gedit, but is a separate application. Just click the Dash button in the corner and type 'Character Map'. Or press Alt+F2 and type charmap and press enter.\n\nA: As mentioned by other answers, you can use unicode characters to do so.\nThe nice bit is that if you write x^2 the characters ^2 will convert into ² As it is done at quite low level (Xlib), it works on almost all applications.\nThe rule lives at /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose (other UTF-8 locales also include this file), iso8859-* locales  also have them for characters they can print\n <dead_circumflex> <2>              : \"²\"   twosuperior # SUPERSCRIPT TWO\n\n\nA: You can't. Simple ASCII text documents don't support any kind of formatting. No italics, no bold, no superscript, no subscript no nothing. If you do add such formatting to your file, it will no longer be a simple text document. \nSo, if you need that kind of functionality, use a format that supports it such as rtf or odt or (shudder) doc. \n\nA: If you have a dead key with ^, you can press it and then the number you want. It would render the number in superscript without the circumflex.\n\nA: A Character Map plugin is available for gEdit.  Enable the plugin in the Preferences.  Enable the Side Pane in the View menu.  Click on the Character Map icon at the bottom of the Side Pane, then choose \"Common\" and you will find the superscript 4 (even though it looks like am missing superscript 1-3). Below that are the subscripts and other special characters.\nTo use a certain character, just drag it from the character map on the Side Pane to the document. You can then copy-paste it in the right position.\nFrom a question in the comments below:\nAfter enabling the character map plugin, you can open/view the characters by click the icon that looks like a key with an \"a\" on it on the bottom left corner.  \nIn my screenshot below, there are three icons in the Side Pane:  The first is the documents icon to view all open documents, the second is the file browser for the file browser plugin and the third is the Character Map plugin.\nCheck screenshot below:\n\n\nA: As terdon said, an ASCII Text file means ONLY text, no formatting as in Libreoffice writer files.\nBut in the specific case , you can use the unicode characters that refer to superscripted 0-9 and subscripted 0-9.\nHere are they  ⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹  ₀ ₁ ₂ ₃ ₄ ₅ ₆ ₇ ₈ ₉\n\n\nA document on how to tpye special characters is available offline in Ubuntu Desktop Guide(search for Enter special characters) as well as online here on gnome.org.\n\n\n", "Q: Annotating PDFs in Evince and then viewing the output in Acrobat / Adobe products As I don't use Windows whatsoever and have been a big fan of Evince for some time, I was really happy to learn that Evince now supports the addition of annotations (even if it doesn't support the deletion of them, which I find odd).\nI have a paper accepted for a journal, and I was sent a type-set copy of the paper for proofing.  I was asked to add my corrections directly to the PDF as annotations using Adobe Commenting Tools.\nI decided to use this opportunity to try out Evince for annotation.  It seemed to work like a charm, and so I sent off the annotated PDF to the journal.  But they are saying it is corrupted and cannot be viewed.  I imagine they are using the full version of Acrobat.  I then tried to open the file in Acrobat Reader -- it gets flagged up as corrupted, just as they say.\nBut it opens fine in Evince.  Anyone know how I can make the output Adobe friendly?\nHas anyone tried annotating PDFs in Okular and had the output work with Reader?  Did you have to do anything special?\nThanks!\nUpdate: I edited the title to make it more useful to others searching for the same topic.\n\nA: I believe you can do what you want with master-pdf-editor. It will annotate and play nicely with Adobe. Only snag is that it is free as in beer, but not as in speech,\nhttp://code-industry.net/free-pdf-editor.php\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue. You have to press File → Save As in Okular, otherwise annotations are stored locally. I decided not to use Okular since I find it quiet unhandy how Okular stores the annotations and I simply do not want to use KDE.\nFor me, qpdfview works like a charm. Annotations and text highlighting is recognised in Adobe Reader (Linux version 9, Windows, iOS). Editing done with Acrobat Reader on the aforementioned platfroms are recognised by qpdfview as well. It allows you to delete annotations and highlighting too.\nIt is free, the source code can be found on launchpad. You find it in the Ubuntu Software Center and there is a ppa for a more recent version: ppa:b-eltzner/qpdfview\n\nA: I annotate PDFs in I, Librarian. It supports PDF highlighting and comments.\nhttp://i-librarian.net\n\nA: PDF Studio Viewer will add annotations to PDF documents that are compliant with Adobe products. It can add text highlights, markup, text annotations (typewriter, text box, sticky notes) and shape annotations (circle, rectangle, cloud, line, polygons..). You can go back and move or edit annotations after reopening the documents. \n", "Q: can we add extra items to gallery of libre office writer is there any way that we can follow and add extra items into the gallery of libre office office writer. i am currently working on a big project and i want some extra images and icons.Doing so with the typical method of copy pasting makes the work lengthy that is the reason for asking this question\n\nA: Install the Open ClipArt package from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: How do I remove all desktop-related packages, leaving server only?

While it is running in a terminal window, I modify the file script.sh. Will this have any effect on the already running process?\nAfter modifying it, I execute the modified file, so I have two running process now. Is this okay?\n\nA: I'll add something that I think has not been said in the other answers. Much depends on just how you edit the file. Doing echo \"stuff\" >file from the shell (another instance) will indeed overwrite the file, I think. But if you edit the file with for instance emacs and then save, this will not happen. Instead here the editor renames the old file to some backup name (maybe actually removing the previous backup), and then write its modified buffer contents as a new file with the (now libreated) old name. Since the shell (or other interpreter) reading the script will almost certainly open the file only once, it is thereafter independent of the whereabouts of the file name, it just continues to read the physical disk file (identified by inode number) that was associated to the file name at the time of opening. So even if it reads the script in blocks (which would be the easiest solution if using buffered text I/O), it would continue to read the lines from the old instance of the file, which is likely to not change by your editing.\n\nA: Update:\nThanks to Registered User for pointing me to a better answer on Unix.stackexchange.com.\nDepending upon the size of the script and the compiler/interpreter in question, the script is loaded partially/completely. So, if the script is not completely loaded, the changes that you make to your script will reflect on the running instance once the part of the script is loaded into memory.\nSo, it is not recommended to change your script on the disk which is currently running for unpredictable output: First stop the running instance and then modify your script and then re-execute the script.\nInitial answer: When you make changes to your script, you make the changes on the disk(hard disk- the permanent storage); when you execute the script, the script is loaded to your memory(RAM).\nSo, the changes that you make to the script will not affect the running script, it will run the version you executed before making those changes.\nHowever, when you execute the changed script again without terminating the previously running instance, there will be two instances of the script- one which has the changes and the old one.\nBe warned that the resources that the script uses and modifies will conflict. For example, if you are modifying a file using the script, the script that runs later will not be able to open that file for writing and fail to execute correctly.\n\nA: this needs to be updated, above answers are now only partially correct:\nwith the current version of bash, modifying a script on-disk while it is running will cause bash to \"try\" to load the changes into memory and take these on in the running script.  if your changes come after the currently executing line, the new lines will be loaded and executed.  but, this is a guess by bash and it may get it right or wrong.\nthe better way to do this is the following sequence of actions:\n1) load the script into memory\n2) delete the script from disk\n3) write a new script to disk\nby deleting the disk version first, the memory version loses its links to it so that when you supply a new version in step 3, no attempt by bash will be made to load the new contents into the memory version.\n\nA: @jobin's answer is generally correct, but I'll add some other answers that may be to the point depending what you want to do.\nIf you want to change the script, and want to know that it's safe, then you want to write to a new file, not the existing one, The new file can be located where the old one was though.  Write your new version to a new file, and then use mv to move it into place over the top of the old one.  The file that has been replaced still exists, it's just not linked from the directory.  Your running script can continue using it, and when that script closes its file handle the system knows that it can safely clean up the file (whether immediately or at a later time).\nIf you want to behave the behaviour of the script on the fly, you have a more difficult problem.  I expect you'd need to build it into the code of the script.  Bash scripts can handle signals (eg can catch something like kill -USR1 [pid]), and a script could then respond by reloading some code.  So maybe you can get functionality close to what you want, but without knowing what you're after, I'm not seeing a good reason to do this, and I suspect if you want to do something this complex you probably want a more sophisticated programming language to do it in.\nIf you want to hack the behaviour of a running script that is not written with this in mind, then you're out of luck.  I'd hesitate to call any programming task impossible, but if you had the resources and skills for this sort of task, you presumably wouldn't be asking here.\n\nA: The shell is not like other scripting languages.\nThe shell reads and executes commands one by one, so the simple answer is \"yes, editing a running script can affect it\", but it's important to understand the details.\nIf you are careful, you can add lines to the end of a running script, and they will be run after the other commands already in the script.\necho \"echo 'This extra command will also run.'\" >> yourscript.sh\n\nSome editors may write a new file (inode) with the same name as the old one; any changes made that way won't affect what the shell reads (which is why those editors do that). Thus confounds some attempts at testing this.\nBut as long as you're still dealing with the same inode, the running shell will be affected if the script is altered beyond the point it has read up to - unless of course it invokes exit before then.\nReading is typically done 4KiB blocks, so that small scripts may appear to run unaffected, but when it's close to the end of file, the shell (like all text processing programs) will read whatever it can get. This \"short read\" does not by itself signal end-of-file, and the shell will continue to read until it reads no bytes at all. Thus, if the file gets longer while the shell is reading it, the shell will read the new data.\nIt's important to note at this point that the shell won't attempt to read more data until it needs to, either to finish parsing a compound command, or because it's simply run all the previous commands. That delay is where you have a chance to alter the file containing the script.\nSo any change that makes the file longer will almost  always have some effect.\nEditing a file and inserting N bytes in the middle will reposition the last N bytes of the file to just beyond where the end-of-file used to be. Those bytes will be read as \"new\" by the shell, even if it has just read them at their previous position.\nAnd to complicate things further, because the block and line boundaries probably won't coincide, the shell may read starting part way through a line, giving rise to the \"gibberish effect\". This can happen happen if you add or delete lines that are before where the shell has read up to.\n", "Q: What language is this file written in and which plotting program can graph it?

If you use GParted to resize, GRUB should still boot fine. Windows is generally unaware of GRUB and Linux, so it may accidentally overwrite necessary data. It's safer to do it from Linux.\nGParted is capable of handling NTFS partitions as well. There's a tradeoff here: GParted can resize to as much free space is available, but it will move around data (like defragmentation) to make room, and may take a long time. Windows can do it quicker, but it may not be able to get all the space (only after the last used sector). \nIn your case, I'd recommend Windows for resizing only the Windows partition, and Linux for resizing the rest. BTW, 100 GB is a bit overboard for Linux root, I think. 30 should plenty. Keep your data on another partition in case you have to format. \n", "Q: I downloaded ubuntu but I also had to download WinZip in order to complete the download?

Then right click on the minecraft.jar file and say 'Open'\nMinecraft like many games, is dependent upon the graphics subsystem of your computer.  It may play more slowly than you would like, and this can be because of the OpenJDK Java runtimes, or because of the graphics driver in use, or some other issue.

That is what I do for my kids to play.\n\nA: My preferred way of installing and playing Minecraft doesn't involve downloading the jar. Open up a terminal CTRL + ALT + T . Then paste in the following lines: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minecraft-installer-peeps/minecraft-installer sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install minecraft-installer . This will instal Open-JDK as well as Minecraft, it comes with a nifty launcher which you can use from the Dash or by pinning it to the Launcher.\n", "Q: Does duplicity detect when a Backup Is Already In-Progress? Any time you schedule a recurring backup, it is always possible for a previously-initiated-backup to run so long that the next scheduled backup gets initiated before the previous backup completes.\nGiven the concept of duplicity's backup-chains, does duplicity inherently check to see if a backup is already in-progress before allowing an additional attempt to modify that same backup chain?\nI'm aware of solutions to prevent this (outside of duplicity), but my question is does duplicity's code already inherently address this concern?\n\nA: As of 0.6.23, duplicity will do file locking on the cache directory associated with the backup.  It is possible to have two duplicity instances running as long as they are different backups.  Duplicity will not allow overlap of the same backup.\nThe previous versions would not detect the problem and that would potentially cause problems when trying to restore the overlapping backups.\n...Ken (Duplicity Maintainer)\n", "Q: Starting mysql server problems I am trying to get mysql (server?) to start.

Instead you should use the keymapping from within the game. This usually involves entering a console within the game (e.g. typing ~) and issuing a bind command.\nA quick search of Dota commands comes up with :\nhttp://dota2.gamepedia.com/List_of_Console_Commands\nhope that helps\n", "Q: Use Ubuntu on Tablet with mouse/keyboard?

I just recently installed Ubuntu 14.04, upgrading from 13.10. The boot time has been extremely slow (like 1.5min to boot to desktop 1min to login screen). first I will state my hardware. I am running a TPower-I45 Dual core CPU with 4GB of ddr2 ram. My GPU is a Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 7850(I have tried the open-source drivers and the proprietary fglrx drivers, it stays at the same boot time). I have a 160GB SATA drive which is where the OS is installed. The first time I installed 14.04 I noticed this issue and reinstalled it and nothing changed. I will now go through exactly what happens when booting. First after the initial BIOS screen I get a purple rectangle around the edges of my monitors. This stays for about 8-10 seconds. Then the screen turns black and stays black for 20-30 seconds. The Ubuntu splash screen comes on for around 2 seconds then the screen goes black again. After having a black screen for another 30-40 seconds the Ubuntu desktop will show up and everything from there works fine. If I choose to boot to the login screen boot time goes down about 15 seconds. I thought maybe my SATA drive wasn’t connected properly but It is connected fine. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If this is just a bug I guess I could live with it as it doesn’t effect the overall use of Ubuntu but it does get a little annoying. Could buying a new SATA drive and using clonezilla to put Ubuntu onto the new drive solve the problem if it is related to the Sata drive?\n\nA: might be fixed with additional firmware. try installing linux-firmware-nonfree and any other firmware that sounds like hardware on your system. You can use the terminal command 'apt-cache search firmware' to get a bit longer list than appears in software-center.\n", "Q: Why do I need to have superuser permissions to mount share to local mount point? Well, title says it all, but to be more clear:\nTo mount a share in a local mount point I need to do something like\nsudo mount -t cifs //location/to-share /home/<user>/some/destination -o gid=<gid>,uid=<uid>,username=<username>\n\nConversely, doing this:\nmount -t cifs <all the other arguments>\n\nwill result in mount: only root can do that. Why? Why do I need to be superuser? I am adding something to my home directory. Then why do I need to superuser? I'm sure there is a valid reason, but it just strikes me as odd. \n\nA: I believe the answer to WHY can't a normal user mount something anywhere would be that a mount can be mounted OVER an existing directory, completely hiding the existing directory. If you do this with a directory containing binaries than the user would be able to alter the binaries that get executed.\nNow if you own the directory (like your home directory) then perhaps it would not as big of a deal. But I think root would want to know if a new drive got mounted before he or she trusted the content of that mount point. Thus you can specifically allow a user to mount to a particular mount point, but the default is to disallow.\n\nA: If what you mounted contains a setuid root program, and your mount options enabled it, you can effectively gain root. Thus, irrespective of where you're mounting stuff, allowing users to mount without requiring root is a security risk.\n", "Q: Can't read Ubuntu partition on Windows 8 I installed Ubuntu 14.04 with a Live CD, and it seemed to work. However, when I boot into Windows 8, it shows up as Unallocated space. When I use Gparted, it shows up properly. I wanted to use a dual-boot system using the Windows 8 boot manager instead of GRUB. I have EasyBCD and that can't read the partition either. Can anyone help?\n\nA: Windows 8 is not capable of reading the ext4 filesystem, which is Ubuntu's default file system.\n\nA: There are many different tools in both Linux and Windows for examining the disk, and they react in different ways -- even within one OS. Thus, it's not clear precisely what the problem is you're seeing in Windows. It's possible that you're encountering this problem, but I can't be positive of that. If so, see the page to which I linked for a full description and a fix. (You just need to change the type code on your Linux partition(s).) If it's something else, please provide a clearer description, including the program(s) that are showing unexpected results, and perhaps a screen shot.\nIf you're booting in EFI mode (as is likely if the computer shipped with Windows 8), EasyBCD will be useless for managing multi-booting -- or at least, that was the case the last I heard. GRUB can handle boot management duties, or you can use another boot manager, such as gummiboot or my own rEFInd.\n", "Q: How to use UUIDs in fstab for configuring btrfs RAID1 This is similar to this question, but the solution there was to choose the disks using \"device=/dev/sda1,/dev/sdb1\", which is not as robust as using UUIDs.  I'm sure it can be done, but I can't find any examples/documentation using UUIDs for the individual disks.\nThe closest example I could find is here, but that's using \"by-id\" device=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-HGST_HDS724040ALE640_PK1334PBG3GYHS instead of UUID which I'd prefer.  \nUsing that as a template, I tried UUID=3d12bc7b-61b1-4dea-b78b-ef9a44a6b698       /media/btr0    btrfs device=/dev/disk/by-uuid/6dc5624c-2d54-4726-b2fa-a7a988d337a4,device=/dev/disk/by-uuid/b57f2240-fa2e-4516-9049-603d2c5029b5 0 0 but it didn't work.  Any ideas?\n\nA: I noticed that my system was saying \"scanning for btrfs file systems\" during boot, so I simplified my fstab entry to UUID=3d12bc7b-61b1-4dea-b78b-ef9a44a6b698 /media/btr0 btrfs defaults 0 0 and that seems to work OK.  \n", "Q: Win 8.1 won't boot I have read alot about dual booting ubuntu and windows, but I have not seen an answer to my situation.

Afterwards you can mount it as loopback device with command:\nsudo mkdir /media/floppy1/\nsudo mount -o loop /path/imagefile.img /media/floppy1/\n\nTo unmount, use the command\nsudo umount /media/floppy1/\n\nIf you want to create an image from the physical floppy disk, use dd command (disclaimer - I didn't try the below as my floppy is gone!  but should work) (and assume that's 1.44MB type floppy disk... 1.2MB ones should have gone at the time of DOS 6.22 )\ndd bs=512 count=2880 if=/dev/fda of=/path/imagefile.img\n\nReference: man page of mkfs.msdos; Create mount and copy floppy disks images under linux\n\nA: I have experienced this too.

I can still change my wallpaper right? But the screenshots I see of themes seem different in that. For example, one theme had a light-blue wallpaper and so all its windows and dialogues were light-blue. Does it mean the theme is set to light-blue and has an uneditable wallpapers package?\nFurther, by Unity Tweak Tool and other tools, I can change the colour schemes, etc. So what's the use of a theme anyway?\n\nA: See @Jbuch14 comment he explained it nicely and theme won't change wallpaper you have to set the wallpaper manually. As you asked they won't come with uneditable wallpapers package you can change your wallpapers. In your example what they did is set a gtk theme first which changes window decorations to light-blue and after that manually kept a matching light-blue wallpaper.\n", "Q: Remapping Keyboard Volume Controls I want to use this keyboard with Ubuntu (12.04):\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87ML-EFB2/dp/B0050ODQEI\nIt has no media keys.\nWhat I'm wondering is, will I be able to remap the 'Print Screen', 'Scroll Lock' and 'Pause Break' keys to the volume controls ('Mute', 'Down', 'Up'), without activating their original functions, or anything else (i.e. Screenshot, etc)?\nOr, do you have a better solution for what keys I can remap the volume controls to?\nThank you.\n\nA: I have a basic PC keyboard, a Logitech K120, and it also does not have media buttons.\nI have tried setting the Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause/break keys to Mute, Volume down, and Volume up; in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nThey all were recognized and added to the configuration, but the Scroll Lock key for the Volume Down did not work.

So how can I solve this issue.and why this is happening.\n\nA: By looking at your comment you've said that you changed it to static via terminal. Assuming that; you've two ways where you can achieve which will be permanent even when you reboot the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*First is via terminal by adding an additional line to specify DNS\n\n*Assigning manual IP's via GUI whilst setting the interface to default (reverting back network config)\n\n\nSince you've used terminal, you may add below line to your /etc/network/interfaces file. Add it to the end of the file\ndns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8\n\nYou don't need to add your gateway as a DNS. You may add above two DNS with a space between the two. Also, below seen is a sample configuration of an interface.\nauto eth0                                      # add this to auto up on boot\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.x.x.x\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.x.x.x\n    dns-search example.com                     # This is for windows AD environment\n    dns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8\n\nAs you can see, the attribute dns-search example.com is for Windows Active directory environment. You can remove that line.\nOnce done. Please restart you network interface using below command.\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nand then view the resolv.conf file with cat /etc/resolv.conf which should show the DNS configuration. You may also reboot and have a look through.\nHope this helps! :)\n\nA: For Quick Solution Just type the following command in the terminal.\n\nsudo /sbin/dhclient\n\n", "Q: MySQL Ambiguous Option issue MySQL is starting correctly as a service, and my WP instance / phpMyAdmin connects to it successfully.

I have a script that will get executed by incrond when it sees changes in a watch dir. There is only a few env vars that are available in the script, the rest get cleared by incrond. So this becomes a problem when you want to execute something that depends on X vars such as $DISPLAY. So I'm wondering if it's possible to get var $DISPLAY from inside the script without querying from user shell\n\nA: To get a environment variable of a running process, you need to look at the environ file in the proc filesystem.

Linux system based on root(super user) parodigm: root can do anything without some feedbacks like asking password. In Ubuntu root user was turned off.\nSo Administrator has to perform this feedbacks sometimes, but if you dont want this you can always do sudo | sudo -i | gksudo | ... to grant yourself or your application rigths of root to do everything.

If yes, could you post here your procedure step by step?\nPlease does not include your experience with any other ThinkPad models.\nEdit: Situation is not so simple, see: Lenovo ThinkPad T440p + Ubuntu 12.04/14.04\n\nA: It is most likely been proven that Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 64-bit will work on your device. Please check this link for more details: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201307-13930/\nAs mentioned, check out this guide of how to install Ubuntu: How do I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: for me installing Ubuntu 14.4 on a lenovo t440p worked after I followed the instructions found here \n\nI had the same problem with my T440p i7-4700MQ with Intel and Nvidia.\nI managed to finally boot off a 14.04 Live-DVD by pressing F6 and/or ESC as \n  soon as the \"Press Enter\" disappeared. Then I modified the boot options to \"nomodeset\"\n  which led me to the choice between \"try ...\" and \"install ...\". I went for \"try...\"\n  and once the desktop showed up from where I then installed Trusty 64bit.\nIt goes without saying that the boot options in grub are set to nomodeset, but at \n  least the notebook is working. WLAN is ok. I reach speeds up to 780 MBit/s. There \n  remain several issues though: display brightness buttons are not functional, \n  fingerprint reader is not detected, and the proprietary nvidia driver is something \n  that will maybe work properly some day.\n\nNote that, at least with my lenovo 440p, you need to press Fn+F6 instead of just F6 to enter the Boot Options. See BootOptions for a description of the menue in which you get after pressing Fn+F6.\nIf you follow the link above, you should also find instructions on how to install Nvidia Prime. I haven't tried so far.\nFinally, I used an USB stick instead of a DVD.\n\nA: I had many problems with installing Ubuntu/Xubuntu untill I downgraded BIOS to 1.14 version - \nplease see my answer for details - Lenovo T440P Ubuntu 14.04 compatibility? .\nJust to let you know: I was able to install Ubuntu by adding nomodeset option, but graphics card drivers couldn't be load (lshw result shows displays as UNCLAIMED). \nThat cause no 3D acceleration support, no function keys working (to set screen brightness), external displays not working (with ultra dock station), etc. etc. \nAfter downgrading BIOS everything seems to be working perfectly well.\nWish you luck!\n\nA: I tried to post to your shared link (but don't have enough rep to answer) since it is the top google result for this laptops's 14.04 Ubuntu issues. Nevertheless, for my t440p, fwiw 14.10 desktop 64-bit worked flawlessly (see caveat below), I downloaded updates during install, installed the nvidia proprietary drivers (\"updates\" version) after login, and was able to launch CS: Source as a test. This is miraculous compared to the constant freezes that would occur in 14.04, requiring a hard shutdown.\nNot sure what model you have, but I have the 20ANCTO1WW (4800MQ, 730M, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD). After spending nearly an entire evening attempting to figure out how to get around the issues with this thing and 14.04 I gave up and just tried 14.10. Lenovo's website says that >= 2.26 BIOS cannot be downgraded (I have 2.28, having recently ordered the laptop). So the downgrade to 1.14 was not an option for me.  \nSo, if you're not married to 14.04, try 14.10 and see if it works for you. Caveat: I could not get sound to work, however, it did not work in Windows either, so I'm fairly certain it's a hardware issue.\nHope that helps!\nBest regards,\nJ\n", "Q: Restore main menu items in Lubuntu Can someone post here /home/your_user/.config/menus/lxde-application.menu file?\nI've got it rewritten and now my menu is broken.\nOr if someone know how to restore main menu applet - feel free to answer\nThank you\n\nA: *\n\n*If you have guest account you should be able to log on as guest (or another account) and copy the file from there to your account.\n\n*Another possible solution:  I know that if you delete an application config file in your home folder and then restart, a new config file will be created and it is supposed to be the default file.

You need to turn of TPM and Secure boot in UEFI ( what some people still but incorrectly call BIOS ) to install Ubuntu. You can install Ubuntu ( or another .iso ) if you install e.g. Grub2Win and make it your primairy bootloader. You need to add the option to boot from .iso in the bootmenu.Then when booting choose the .iso.\n\nA: You can try using EasyBCD to add the ISO to the Windows Boot Manager. In some cases it may not work, but give it a try.\n\nA: Create a VM that uses a physical disk, then boot the VM with the ISO image.\nI'd recommend using VMWare for this, as I've found Virtualbox harder to configure.\nI'd recommend using a complete disk for this. Using only a partition is possible in theory but I've never done it.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all the partitions where you'll install linux. On Windows 7 / 8 do it from \"Computer Management\". (some partitions are protected, and windows won't allow VMWare to access the disk if they're not removed first).\n\n*Open VMWare as Administrator (secondary click, run as Admin). Create a new VM, choose custom mode, when creating the HD choose create from physical disk.\n\n*Boot the VM from the ISO. If you only see a white cursor and a black screen you're booting from the empty HD.\n", "Q: Error while attempting to install Apache 2 version 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 I am attempting to install Apache2 version 2.2 on a computer I just upgraded from Ubuntu  12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS because a critical software package that runs perfectly on the version of Apache in 12.04 does not work on version 14.04.\nFrom other questions in this forum, I see there is a way to specify a version number while using apt-get, but this isn't working.

I haven't reported an issue in ages, so I don't recall what the apport program returns. I think the final stage of the bug filing is left up to you (from the Ubuntu wiki), so if you logged into Launchpad, you get subscribed automatically.\nThat was how it operated once, anyway. Now the whoopsie daemon is used in conjunction with apport to automate this. Check out What is the 'whoopsie' process and how can I remove it? for more information on whoopsie. I think in recent versions, error reporting to Launchpad directly is disabled and only https://errors.ubuntu.com is used, unless it encounters a new bug (from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2136684).\n(If the links don't show up well-formatted, somebody please edit this.

This Amarok Manual\nsays somewhat diffusely that it is possible to search for last modified, but doesn't say how to do that. \n\n*I tried to sort the playlist by last played, hoping that that would trick amarok into playing only songs before a certain date if seeded correctly, but unfortunately the last played date of the current song is changed to \"just now\" just before it ends, sorting it to the top. The next song then played is the one played next to last, so amarok just gets into a loop of the last two songs. \n\n*I then changed the number of previous songs in the playlist to 0, hoping that that would automatically delete all songs that were played after the last time the current song was played. This would have of course led to a running off to the \"never played\" songs, but slowly enough for me to live with that. But it doesn't work, because amarok doesn't delete the songs above the current song.\n\n*My current workaround is to fill the playlist with as many songs as possible, sort this by last played, then put all the songs I want into the waiting loop (or whatever this is called in the English version, I mean the option you can select by rightclicking on a song in the playlist), delete the rest, and repeat this process approximately every 7 hours. \nNow I'm hoping there's is a less annoying way to achieve this, so: Is there a good way to do this? \n\nA: In the 'Media Sources' panel, go into 'Playlists', then 'Dynamic Playlists'.\nAdd a new playlist. It will give you one with a criterion (bias) like 'genre:Rock'. Select and edit it.\nChange the match type to 'Match meta tag'. This will give you a different set of options below.\n\nChange the first dropdown ('Simple search') to 'Last Played'. The other two inputs let you do various things such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before 1 January 2014 (collection search equivalent = lastplay:<01/01/2014)\n\n*Older than 200 days (collection search equivalent = lastplay:>200d)\n\n\nOK that, and double click the playlist to use it.\nNote that (as far as I can tell) tracks that have never been played get included if you use the 'before' construct but are not included if you use the 'older than' construct. If you want to include unplayed tracks in the latter case, you need to use an 'Or'/Match Any bias with two sub-biases: the lastplay:>200d one and a playcount:0 one.\n\nA: I'm afraid this isn't (exactly) an Amarok solution (it sounds like you've exhausted that search).\nHowever, this kind of query is fairly easy in Quod Libet (disclaimer: I know as I'm one of the devs):\ne.g. a search of:\n#(lastplayed > 1 year)\n\nwill return all songs not played in the last year. This can be combined with all other search syntax as normal, e.g. \n&(genre=Classical, #(lastplayed>10 weeks))\n\nwill return all classical songs not played in the last week.\nIf you want you can automate this; using the command line, you now can do:\n$ quodlibet --print-query \"#(lastplayed > 1 year)\"\n\n...this then prints a list of full paths to the songs that match that query to stdout. Should be fairly easy to import that wherever you need e.g. into Amarok.\n", "Q: Refresh indicator-cpufreq Is there a way to refresh indicator-cpufreq / cpu frequencies after enabling a pstate on the cpu(without reboot)?\nThank you.\n\nA: Kill the process and start it again:\nuser@host:~$ kill $(pidof indicator-cpufreq)\nuser@host:~$ indicator-cpufreq\n\n", "Q: forgot password for another one user account created in my system, how to solve it?

This was causing problems for me, since even though that folder didn't show up when I ran bin/hadoop fs -ls, the command bin/hadoop fs -cat output/* was actually searching in the folder that I had generated before, instead of the output of the program that I had just run. After deleting that output directory with rm -rf output/, the problem went away.\n", "Q: using the dd command to copy 'broken' disk I have got an external seagate harddisk, used for backup.

I tried \"dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb\" and got \"access denied\", so I guess nothing has been overwritten at least. sdc is the seagate disk according to hwinfo and diskhandling manager installed at ubuntu, and sdb is an internal disk with same capacity, just empty. any ideas of what I should do to restore my data (if dd is able to)? or is the disk just too damaged to recover?\n\nA: You need root permissions to read from or write to a raw hard disk. So you would need to run\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb\nThat being said, dd will create a raw copy of the disk with all its partition, bit by bit. It will not repair anything – however, it is a good idea to copy the data from the damaged disk to a good one using the above command, and then try to repair the copy of the data. That way, if something goes wrong and your rescue attempts end up doing more damage, you still have the original of the bad data and can make a fresh copy.\nWhen you have cloned your bad disk that way, unplug it. Then you can start the actual recovery on the copy. One tool is fsck, which you can run in the following way (agagn, you need to be root):\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb1\n/dev/sdb1 would be the first partition of your disk. If you have more than one partition, repeat the same for /dev/sdb2, /dev/sdb3 and so on.\nThere is no guarantee that this will recover any data – but if not, it will give you a hint of the kind of damage and where to look further.\n", "Q: Filter only path of files (without directories path) from output using pipe | rpm -qpl dhad-9.0.27891-2.x86_64.rpm allows to display all file paths and directory paths of this package .\nExample of output :\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/winmm.dll.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/winspool.drv.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/winsta.dll.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/wintrust.dll.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/ws2_32.dll.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/lib/wine/wtsapi32.dll.so\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/coue1255.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/coue1256.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/coue1257.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/coure.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/couree.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/coureg.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/courer.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/couret.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/cvgasys.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/hvgasys.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/jsmalle.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/jvgasys.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/marlett.ttf\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smae1255.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smae1256.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smae1257.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smalle.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smallee.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smalleg.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smaller.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/smallet.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssee1255.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssee1256.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssee1257.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssee874.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssef1255.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssef1256.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssef1257.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/ssef874.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserife.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserifee.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserifeg.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserifer.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserifet.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sseriff.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sseriffe.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sseriffg.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sseriffr.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/sserifft.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/svgasys.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/symbol.ttf\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/tahoma.ttf\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/tahomabd.ttf\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgas1255.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgas1256.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgas1257.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgas874.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgasys.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgasyse.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgasysg.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgasysr.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/fonts/vgasyst.fon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/generic.ppd\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/l_intl.nls\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/wine/share/wine/wine.inf\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/LICENSE\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/README\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-desktop-icon\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-desktop-menu\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-email\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-icon-resource\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-mime\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-open\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-screensaver\n/opt/dhad/tv_bin/xdg-utils/xdg-settings\n/usr\n/usr/bin\n/usr/bin/viewer\n/var\n/var/log\n/var/log/viewer\n\nI want to filter only file paths :\ni try :\nrpm -qpl dhad-9.0.27891-2.x86_64.rpm | find -type f\n\nAlso :\nrpm -qpl dhad-9.0.27891-2.x86_64.rpm|grep -f\n\nAlso :\nrpm -qpl dhad-9.0.27891-2.x86_64.rpm |ls -f\n\nAll didn't work.\n\nA: Well that was horrible.

It is essentially, why can't I change my compliance level in Eclipse from 1.6 to 1.7 but I'm going to leave the body of my question as it was typed originally.\nThis is a very specific question but I'm going through a series of Java courses online and one of the lessons deals with switch. The example code uses switch with strings (both the course and I use Eclipse). When I try to run the code it gives me an error stating\n\"Cannot switch on a value of type String for source level below 1.7. Only convertible int values or enum constants are permitted\"\nI understand this is because strings can only be used with switch in Java 7. Thus I went about installing Java 7 in terminal using some instructions I found online. Afterwards Eclipse wouldn't run at all. I went to switch back to Java 6 and found I was running Java 7 Oracle but had option to change to Java 7 OpenJDK so I did. Eclipse is working again but I still get the same error as before. Why is this? And is there a way to fix it?\nFor some added info, here's what terminal returns when I type in  \"sudo update-alternatives --config java\" to switch between versions.\nglitch@glitch-Inspiron-1720:~$ sudo update-alternatives --config java\n[sudo] password for glitch: \nThere are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).\n\n  Selection    Path                                           Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java         1062      auto mode\n  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java   1061      manual mode\n* 2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java   1051      manual mode\n  3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java         1062      manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\"\n\nAs you can see I'm currently using java-7-openjdk where as before I was using java-7-oracle (which resulted in Eclipse plain out not working) and before that I assume I was using java-6-openjdk (this is what I run Minecraft in after all but who knows).\nMore specifically I'm using:\nglitch@glitch-Inspiron-1720:~$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.7) (7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1~0.12.04.2)\nOpenJDK Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)\n\nI looked at this question: Can't use Java 7 from Eclipse?\nI tried following the instructions given therein all the way up to changing Properties > Java Compiler > Compliance Level to 1.7\nI found the location of my JVM was /usr/lib/jvm/ but when I put this in for JRE home in Eclipse it gives me this error: \"Target is not a JDK Root.

But still that function to connect to a LDAP-Server as Data-Source exists besides JDBC etc., it is listet in the libreOffice-Help-Files. \nEdit.: I've found a tutorial (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/xsoft/libreoffice.html) (for gentoo) for compiling libreoffice. Before compiling, you can use the autogen.sh to configure the program. And there is an option --with-system-openldap. As desciption i found: (If i understand correct) if that parameter is added to the autogen.sh, the libreoffice will be using a version of OpenLDAP, alreday installed on the system instead of downloading a new one.\nWhy is libreoffice using OpenLDAP anyways? Is it the same as with the libldap, or is it a hint, that it may work with a compiled version to use Adressbooks etc. from LDAP-Servers?  \nEDIT2:\nWell, as I unterstand now, it would at least work, if I add the respective LDAP-Server within Evolution and use EvolutionLDAP within libreoffice as database-choice.\nAnd i found out, that i had to install the .deb-package from the official libreoffice website instead of using the PPA for the availability of the evolution-LDAP-database-connection.\nI will test an LDAP-Server this way soon and I will mark this thread as solved if it will work.\n--messedupcoffeekid\n\nA: Installing libldap just allows to access data from an ldap server related to the LibreOffice user.

I am using 2 hard drives and one grub bootloader [not using BIOS]\nWas told to just add / of the 3rd distro in a resized partition. When I did the 3rd distro worked fine but the ubuntu that was up and running fine before wouldn't load because it couldn't find  /home.\nThis can't be that difficult. I am just missing something.\n\nA: I think your older Ubuntu's /etc/fstab wasn't using UUIDs to identify the partitions (instead, something like /dev/sdaX). Thus when you resized partitions, there may have been a change in the numbering, and thus a missing /home partition. Either that, or it was using UUIDs, and you somehow modified the /home partition, causing its UUID to change.\nEither way, check the fstab of the new system to see what the /home entry should look like. If that file isn't using UUIDs, note the correct partition number, and look up its UUID:\nsudo blkid \n# Or\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/\n\nThen fix the entries in both systems to use the correct UUID (by using UUID=<uuid> instead of /dev/sdaX in the fstab).\n\nA: I've done this before myself, though it was a long time ago.  You're using grub so that makes it easy.  I'm assuming you've got Windows installed on 1 drive and Ubuntu on the 2nd drive, if that isn't the case then forgive me.\nHowever, the key for installing a 3rd installation is you need it to have its own root and home - though if memory serves they can use the same swap partition so long as you don't use hibernate (as that uses the swap partition).  So when you install the 3rd OS, you just need to make room for it's partitions.  When installing, tell it you want to do custom partitions, shrink your Ubuntu partition to make room for the new install.  Create a new partition (2 if you are using separate home and root, or 3 if you want it to have its own dedicated swap partition).  Tell the new distro to install there.  As a matter of safety if it gives me the option to specify mount points for the other partitions I always specify them to avoid confusion in the OS.\nSo if I've got Ubuntu A on the system with a swap and a main partition and install Ubuntu B, when installing I make sure Ubuntu B knows I want it to mount the Ubuntu A partition in something like /dual-boot/Ubuntu-A or the like, so that the OS doesn't get confused as to where root and home are.  The installer should detect that you've got GRUB installed and simply install the extra boot options to it.\nIf you end up with either Linux distro not able to find home then you'll need to look at that distro's fstab and find out what it is trying to mount.  Also, for simplicity, some google searches on dual booting 2 linux distros could be handy.  The Windows bootloader is called from GRUB and thus as long as GRUB always knows where to find it, you're good on that one.\nAs additional resources, I'd look at the following links:\nDual Booting 2 Distro's\nSame for Tom's Hardware\nYouTube Video on the same\nRemember, as a general rule as long as Grub knows where to find the distro you want to boot you're fine.  If I had to guess, previously, you mentioned that it couldn't find home and that might have simply been a matter of the new installer changing the partition map, it doesn't know the other distro exists so if it tried to claim your old home as root, or as its home, or swapped them around, etc...  Then you're going to have issues.  That's why you do the mapping manually.\n", "Q: How can I fix “setenv command not found ” error ? (Ubuntu 12.04.4) I use Ubuntu 12.04.4. I install tcsh.

(I've looked around the site and found only a few questions that could potentially be relevant, most of them downvoted and unclear, or involving computers that previously had an OS. Sorry if this is considered a dupe.)\nIf I get a brand new laptop without any preinstalled OS, and I wish to install Ubuntu (and no other OS) on it, is the installation process any different from installing alongside Windows? Most importantly, what partitioning, if any, would the computer ship with?\nI have installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 (though not with UEFI) before, and I can burn the ISO to a DVD from that computer. It's just the actual installation that I'm asking about.\nThe possibly relevant specs of the computer I want to install Ubuntu on are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Acer Aspire E1-531G\n\n*Intel Pentium 2020M 2.4GHz dualcore processor\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*750GB HDD\n\n*has DVD drive\n\n\nA: Without an existing OS, the installation is easier - you have no need to worry about data retention or compatibility with prior operating systems.  I would be tempted to let Ubuntu do whatever it feels like to the disk (it will reformat and partition the disk by itself) unless you have a specific desire to have some partitions, like /home, seperated out.\n\nA: I've heard that many computers that ship with \"no\" OS actually ship with FreeDOS installed. If you don't want FreeDOS, you'll just delete its partitions and start again, as others have said.\nThere is an important question that nobody's yet addressed, though: BIOS/CSM/legacy boot vs. EFI/UEFI boot. If the computer ships with FreeDOS, it will be configured to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, which means that the disk will use the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system. There's no guarantee, though, that the Ubuntu installer will boot in BIOS mode; it might well boot in EFI mode, which will trigger an EFI-mode installation. Either mode can work fine, but you can also get into weird problems that affect one mode or the other but not both. (Usually EFI is more trouble-prone, but sometimes it can go the other way.) Also, sometimes an external medium will boot in one mode but the computer will try to boot the hard disk in the other way, which can cause boot problems. The usual solution is to dig into the firmware setup utility to fix it after the fact.\nIn a best-case scenario, everything will \"just work\" (in either mode), so you could just try booting from your CD-R or USB flash drive and see what happens. The worst-case scenario is that it won't work and you'll need to dig into firmware settings to get it right, or perhaps run Boot Repair or manually install a boot loader to fix the problem with the initial installation.\nYou can make a deliberate choice about your boot mode by setting options in the firmware setup tool and/or by selecting the way you boot the installer. There are advantages to both boot modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Advantages of BIOS/CSM/legacy\n\n*\n\n*More familiar to most users\n\n*More documentation available online\n\n*Better tested\n\n*More compatible with more OSes for multi-boot setups\n\n\n*Advantages of EFI/UEFI\n\n*\n\n*On most modern computers, boots more quickly\n\n*Option to use Secure Boot, which can help protect against pre-boot malware\n\n*More boot loader options\n\n*Saner boot loader management options, once you understand the rules\n\n*A few advanced EFI-only runtime features, like the ability to store kernel crash dumps to NVRAM\n\n*There are likely to be more such options in the future, including options that might help ordinary users\n\n\n\nNote that most people consider Secure Boot to be a hassle at best. It's true that it can be that, but you can disable it, so the worst-case scenario for a single-boot configuration is that it's something to be disabled in the firmware. If you want to learn to use it, though, it can help with security.\nPersonally, I use EFI whenever possible -- but I began learning about it years ago, to the point that I took over development of rEFIt (creating rEFInd), so I'm much more familiar with EFI than most people. If you're uncomfortable learning it, you can stick to BIOS/CSM/legacy -- but you may need to learn enough about your firmware settings to force a boot in that mode. Unfortunately, different implementations have different user interfaces, so I can't be more specific about how to do that.\n\nA: Start by booting your Live DVD or USB of Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Install Ubuntu\".\n\n\n*Then, you will get the \"Preparing to install Ubuntu\" window. Here, I do not select any of those options. This way the installation is fast and after the installation when you are finally booted into your OS after the installation, then, you can install those extra softwares using the command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\n*After you are done with this you will get the \"Installation Type\" window. Here, select \"Something Else\".\n\n\n*Now, since you are doing a fresh install of Ubuntu therefore, erase everything, then click on \"New Partiton Table\".\n\n\n*Select the options as given in the screenshots:\n\n\n*Here, select the whole drive or according to your needs:\n\n\n*Here, select the mount point as: \"/\".\n\n\n*Next.\n\n\n*Then, press \"Install Now\".\n\n\n*After this, its a very easy process.

I only need 1.3.51.0.1.1.10.10.30.48.2084865.2084839 to print out once.\nI tried to change it to this as well, but Bash does not like it:\nfor i in $(cat ~/jlog/\"$2\"); do\n        grep \"$1\" ~/jlog/\"$2\" |\n        awk '/\\([a-zA-Z0-9.]+/' |\n        awk -F'[(/]' ' {print $2, exit}'\ndone;\n\nThen tried this:\nfor i in $(cat ~/jlog/\"$2\"); do\n        grep \"$1\" ~/jlog/\"$2\" |\n        awk -F'[(/]' '/\\([a-zA-Z0-9.]+/ {print $2, exit }'\ndone;\n\n\nA: You don't need the for loop - a single call grep will output all the matching lines from the file, so you're just repeating the same operation over and over for as many times as there are lines in the file. \nTechnically, you don't need both awk and grep either since both can do textual matching. If you want a more specific answer then post an extract of the log file and an example of what output you want.\n\nA: Try this,\nfor i in $(cat ~/jlog/\"$2\"); do\n        grep \"$1\" ~/jlog/\"$2\" |\n        awk '/\\([a-zA-Z0-9.]+/ {print $7; exit}' \ndone;\n\nexit in the awk command exits after printing the first match.\nOR\nJust pipe the output of for command to the below awk command,\nfor .... | awk -F'[(/]' '{print $2;exit}'\n\n\nA: You haven't explained what you're actually doing so I'll make a couple of assumptions. I assume you're running a script called foo.sh and giving it a string and a file name as an argument. These then become $1 and $2 respectively. Presumably, you are running it with something similar to\nfoo.sh SearchPattern LogFileName\n\nIn any case, the for loop is i) completely useless since you're not using the i variable created by the for i in ... loop. ii) very wrong since that will make i take the value of each word and not the entire line which is what you were probably thinking of iii) the cause of all your problems. You're getting the same results multiple times because you are running the exact same command multiple times. You'll get one result for each line of your file.\nAnyway, what you want can be done with something as simple as\ngrep \"$1\" ~/jlog/\"$2\" | awk '/\\([a-zA-Z0-9.]+/ {print $7}' \n\nOr, simpler:\nawk '/'\"$1\"'/\\([a-zA-Z0-9.]+/ {print $7}' ~/jlog/\"$2\"\n\nThe awk note that the \"$1\" is not within the single quotes. This makes bash expand it to whatever is currently held in $1 before it is passed to awk.\n", "Q: Changing URL for PhpMyAdmin When I install phpmyadmin\napt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nto access it I have to write the following address format\nhttp://123.123.123.123/phpmyadmin\n\nassuming that was the IP address of my server. But what if I want to use a subdomain, for instance\nhttp://phpmyadmin.dbugger.com\n\nHow should I configure/modify the configuration files in Apache, so that it would work?\n\nA: If you installed phpMyAdmin using apt-get, the files are usually installed into /usr/share/phpmyadmin. Hence, creating a new virtual host configuration and pointing the DocumentRoot directive to /usr/share/phpmyadmin should work.\nApache stores its per-site-configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-available.\nCreate /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpmyadmin.dbugger.com (as noted in the comments, if you're using Apache 2.4 on a later version of Ubuntu, a .conf extension is required for the name), then fill it up with the following contents:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName phpmyadmin.dbugger.com\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@dbugger.com\n\n    DocumentRoot /usr/share/phpmyadmin\n    <Directory />\n        Options FollowSymLinks\n        DirectoryIndex index.php\n\n        <IfModule mod_php5.c>\n            AddType application/x-httpd-php .php\n            php_flag magic_quotes_gpc Off\n            php_flag track_vars On\n            php_flag register_globals Off\n            php_admin_flag allow_url_fopen Off\n            php_value include_path .\n            php_admin_value upload_tmp_dir /var/lib/phpmyadmin/tmp\n            php_admin_value open_basedir /usr/share/phpmyadmin/:/etc/phpmyadmin/:/var/lib/phpmyadmin/\n        </IfModule>\n    </Directory>\n\n    # Authorize for setup\n    <Directory setup>\n        <IfModule mod_authn_file.c>\n            AuthType Basic\n            AuthName \"phpMyAdmin Setup\"\n            AuthUserFile /etc/phpmyadmin/htpasswd.setup\n        </IfModule>\n\n        Require valid-user\n    </Directory>\n\n    # Disallow web access to directories that don't need it\n    <Directory libraries>\n        Order Deny,Allow\n        Deny from All\n    </Directory>\n\n    <Directory setup/lib>\n        Order Deny,Allow\n        Deny from All\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nEnable the virtual host:\nsudo a2ensite phpmyadmin.dbugger.com\n\nThen reload Apache:\nsudo service apache2 reload\n\n\nA: I don't think it matters. phpmyadmin connects to the database you tell it to, it has nothing to do with your websites or domain names. So if you have two subdomains that use different databases, just configure phpmyadmin to use the proper one. You can (manually) install several instances of phpmyadmin in /var/www in parallel and configure them diferently; just get the tar.gz and unpack under different names.\n", "Q: Load increasing to very high levels periodically Lately the load on my computer has been increasing significantly (above 10 at times) when I log in to gnome.  The load decreases when I switch to one of the gui-less login options (ctrl+atl+F1 sorry I don't know the proper name for this) back to a reasonable level.  We are using networked home directories via NFS and likewise to manage home directories and logins between machines.  This problem persists when I log in to any of our other machines, but it only occurs for myself and one other member of our group.  Also, when I log in via blackbox instead of gnome this does not occur as frequently, if at all.  The machine that maintains our home directories also seems to increase in load as my machine does.\nEDIT: The load does appear to increase within blackbox as well and I'm not able to get it to decrease via switching to the terminal.  top shows no cpu processes running, but there is currently a load of 5.91 on my computer.\n\nA: Use 'top' (in a console, which is the term you were looking for), or gnome-system-monitor or ksysguard to figure out the main CPU hog.\n", "Q: DRI_PRIME doesnt work I have a HP G6-2251ST(7420g+7670m).

Can you perhaps try this one? \nxrandr --setprovideroffloadsink 0x45 0x7c\n\nIn order to see whether it actually works it can be interesting to use something else than steam, like glxgears.\nglxgears\nDRI_PRIME=1 glxgears\n\nThe latter should show a higher fps in the console than the first. For me it is 60 FPS compared to 3995 (???) FPS.\nOn a side note, DRI_PRIME is great, but does not really work well with the fancy compositors like the one used by Ubuntu Unity. I installed xfce, which I log in to for gaming only, as that works way better. But first try to get steam working on your dedicated GPU :)\n\nA: vblank_mode=0 should unlock your FPS in game.\n", "Q: How to get left Taskbar like thing from Ubuntu in Lubuntu? Sorry for not knowing the technical term for the taskbar in Ubuntu. Can I get that thing also in Lubuntu?\nI'm talking about this thing below\n\n\nA: It's called Dash ans is part of Unity(with Gnome 3). So if you try to bring it is Lubuntu, then it's goodbye LXDE.\nRather, it would be best to install Ubuntu, or install unity side-by-side with LXDE.\n\nA: You can try to install an application like Docky which is kinda like it. (more like the dock in Mac OS X actually). It's not as feature rich but it can at least be used as a convenient place for often used apps!\n", "Q: ASUS USB-N13 Wireless Adaptor Losing connection I have just purchased a new ASUS USB-N13 as it was recommended for use with Ubuntu 14.04. MY connection is set up but closes around every 10 minutes, it then asks my for my Wi-Fi\npassword again to log on \"it gets a bit frustrating after 10 times\". Anyone else had this problem or know a fix for it??\n\nA: I have found that if you go to Asus' support site, locate your device, and click the OS dropdown and select Linux you can find the driver that purportedly supports your device. Device Support Page\nAlso, not sure how much help this may be but here's a forum thread on getting your device working with Ubuntu.

As Google saves any email address one sends a mail to under Other Contacts, this includes some 2700 contacts in my case.\nBut Google also allows one to group contacts, which is how I keep them sorted on my phone and online.\nMy question is:\nIs there a desktop application/hack/fix that will allow me to show and sync my Google contacts, based on their assigned groups?\n\nA: You could also use Thunderbird which is the default email application and install one extension- google contacts 0.7.12 and it will sync your contacts the way you have arranged them in your google account and you can also install Display Contact Photo 1.2.7 extension and it will also show the photos of the contacts if they are visible in the google account.     \nInstalling the Lightning extension along with Google Calender 0.32 will enable you to sync your calendar with Thunderbird email as well. All work quite well with Thunderbird. Have been using it for over a year. \nAll changes you make in Thunderbird for contacts or calendar get reflected in your google account on the web and vice-versa\nBut be prepared to sacrifice about 150 MB of RAM when Thunderbird is running.\nCheers\n", "Q: changed permitrootlogin to no, but I can still login as root I just created a new server (VM) and I setup SSH, I can login fine.\nI created another user account, added it to the admin group and sudo works fine.\nNow I want tried to disable the root login, so I edited the /etc/ssh/ssh_conf file with:\nHost *\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitRootLogin no\nSendEnv LANG LC_*\nHashKnownHosts yes\nGSSAPIAuthentication yes\nGSSAPIDelegateCredentials no\n\n(The above lines are all the lines that are commented out).\nNote: It didn't have PermitRootLogin so I added it myself manually.\nI am running ubuntu 14.04\nI can still login using my non-root account, and I can also login with my root login (it asks for the password and then works fine).\nI did restart the ssh service, and I also restarted the entire VM just in case.\nWhat could the issue be here?\n\nA: You need to change this in /etc/ssh/sshd_config instead. ssh_config settings apply to the client and PermitRootLogin is not applicable to the client (see `man ssh_config for applicable settings).\n\nA: You didn't show while sshd_config but - you must to set PermitRootLogin no before Subsystem option.\nCheers.\n", "Q: How to mount USB 3.5 inch floppy drive and read MS DOS Disk I am running Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\nWhen I plug in my USB floppy drive Ubuntu tries to automount the drive and I get the same error message if there is a disk in the drive or not. The USB Floppy drive works on another laptop that is running Windows 7.\n\"Error mounting /dev/sdb at /media/dave/disk: Command-line `mount -t \"auto\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid\" \"/dev/sdb\" \"/media/dave/disk\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32: mount: no medium found on /dev/sdb\"\nI am not sure how to go about troubleshooting this one.\n--Dave\n\nA: I think the answer maybe Mtools.\nMtools allow you to access MS-DOS formatted floppy disks without having to mount them in Linux. \nIf these tools are not already installed in your system then you can install them using your package manager. \nSo, the first step is to see if you already have the mtools package installed. From a terminal type: mtools and press enter. \nIf mtools is installed, you should see a list of commands all starting with the letter m. If you get an error then you will need to install the package. \nIn Debian based systems you can install mtools by typing:\n     #apt-get install mtools   and then enter your password. \nIn RPM based distributions you can type:\n     #yum install mtools  and then enter. \nNote: In the above commands, # signifies the root user. You can either log in as root or use the sudo command in Ubuntu and the su -c 'command' in other distros. \nNow insert one of your floppy disks that you want to access. \nNote: You will need to use a terminal from this point forward. \nNow depending on your system, begin the commands with either sudo or su -c ', as you need root privileges to use mtools. \nFor example, to view the contents of the floppy disk, use the mdir command by typing:\n     sudo mdir a:   then press enter. You should now hear the floppy drive read the disk and show the contents. \nIf you have any directories there, you can access them by using the mcd command. \n(mcd basically does the same as the cd command in Linux. It changes the current directory to a different one. )\nEG: mcd a:/pictures \nIf you want to copy files from the floppy to your home directory you can do so by using the mcopy command. \nHere are some examples: \nCopy one file to the photos directory in your home folder.  mcopy a:/photo22 /home/user/photos/ \nCopy all files on the root directory of the floppy drive to the photos directory.  mcopy a:/* /home/user/photos/ \nCopy the pictures directory from the floppy drive to your home folder. mcopy -s a:/pictures /home/user/ \nCopy all files and directories from the floppy to the backup folder in your home directory. mcopy -s a:/* /home/user/backup/ \nRemember to use sudo or su -c'command' when issuing these commands. \n", "Q: Multipath configuration help with IBM 1746 SAN (DS3500) \n*\n\n*host: IBM x3850\n\n*FC-HBA: qlogic qle2562, dualport\n\n*DAS-storage: IBM DS3500 dual-controller, 1 port per controller connected\n\n\nAfter setting up a new install of 14.04 and configuring devices, I get device errors during boot for every device and every port of DS3500: see log below.\nI tried to change host operating system in DS3500 from MPP/RDAC to LNXALUA.

So I installed 14.04 LTS and NetBeans today. Opened it and start new project, several times. Won't create new project, won't do nothing.\nAt one point, the app had to be killed. So, I'm totally new to Ubuntu and Linux and need help. I couldn't find answer that could save my problem.\n\nA: Looks like you're hitting bug 1274469; the libnb-javaparser-java package is newer than the netbeans installation.\nThe fix is to manually downgrade your version of libnb-javaparser-java, to match the version of netbeans that's installed. You can do this with:\nwget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libn/libnb-javaparser-java/libnb-javaparser-java_7.0.1-1_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libnb-javaparser-java_7.0.1-1_all.deb\n\nthen restart netbeans.\n\nA: I solved the problem. I reinstalled NetBeans, but I downloaded from their site .sh file, and installed it using the terminal. It works. \nThis is what I used:\nchmod +x netbeans-8.0-linux.sh \n./netbeans-8.0-linux.sh\n\nA: Install the Latest Package of Java first. Make sure to read the Netbeans installation instructions completely. They will mention what version(s) of Java are supported for the version of Netbeans you are downloading.\nNext make sure the netbeans download is extracted (if zipped) and made executable (important). Then open a command line terminal (CTRL - ALT - T). Make sure to execute the sh file as sudo. This will ensure that the Netbeans install will be able to find your version(s) of Java installed.\nsudo sh netbeans-8.0.1-php-linux.sh\n\nA: When starting from shell got the following message:\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=384m; support was removed in 8.0\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM warning: ignoring option PermSize=32m; support was removed in 8.0\n\nin this case this might be the solution:\nnetbeans --jdkhome /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle\n\nor any other jdk7 happens to be installed.\nIf so then to make it more permanent one can edit following lines in /etc/netbeans.conf:\n# Default location of JDK, can be overridden by using --jdkhome <dir>:\n#netbeans_jdkhome=\"/path/to/jdk\"\n\nor to do it in user space edit .desktop or menu file and/or add alias to shell's rc file.\n\nA: Aren't you getting any error messages?\nI believe this issue can be related to permissions.

Or do you still have to follow these steps to enable it?\nI'm considering upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 just for this feature.\nIt's just hard to find a straight answer online.\n\nA: Yes, Dynamic Power Management is enabled by default in Ubuntu 14.04.

I had already purged fglrx before. Here's my xorg log: http://sprunge.us/QRTI. You can see that while it fails to load fglrx, it still loads radeon. And it still is using llvmpipe:\n$ glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL renderer\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 256 bits)\n\n\nA: You need to remove the radeon drivers from the system, and revert to the open source drivers.

Open it (Mousepad for xubuntu). Type the folder name you want to hide. I have attached a picture. Here $RECYCLE.BIN\nand System Volume Information are hidden.

It 'disables' >the Internal Network Adapter Boot - a.k.a. network adapter.\nWith this disabled, the computer cannot connect via wifi.\n...........\n\ni reset my bios setting to default and my wifi in ubuntu returned, no longer greyed out. Windows xp,7,and 8 can reset your bios for you if you have installed on the machine (windows vista will create the same bios problem in some cases and will likely NOT fix the issue in for you.)\n\nA: This may not solve this precise problem, but I spent hours on a mysterious wifi problem after updating to 14.04. The problem was solved by forcing my router to work at only 802.11g rather than n. I think that the router and Ubuntu both thought they could use 802.11n but the old Broadcom adaptor on my HP Netbook, could only handle g standard.\n", "Q: How to select a different autocomplete using the tab shortcut?

What does this mean and how do I fix it?\n\nNow that I know something and this question is popular:\nAnybody know a way to modify your bash_profile so that you can use tab several times to cycle between different paths?\nThe correct answer for someone actually doing this would be to:\ncd ~/.bash_profile or ~/.basher \nopen the file with Sublime/TextEditorOfChoice/VIM/echo into the file:\nThen copy and paste:\nbind '\"\\t\":menu-complete' OR: bind TAB:menu-complete\nThen close and open your terminal/bash/commandprompt.\n\nA: In windows if you type Desk and then Tab it will cycle through all possible (case insensitive) matches. Ubuntu doesn't work quite like this (by default). With ubuntu if you type De Tab it will fill up to Desktop and then you need to tell it how it differentiates.\nIn general putting special characters (like spaces) in a file name is not good practice. There are two ways of selecting a file named \"Desktop Old\" and they are\nDesktop\\ Old\n\nor\n\"Desktop Old\"\n\nIn the first option the \\ acts as an escape character meaning that the character that comes after this should be interpreted not as a part of a command, or a separation of arguments, but rather part of the same argument that preceeds it. The second option simply puts it in quotes. \nSo, in your case what you would do is:\ncp De tab --> cp Desktop\nNow here you would want to type \\ which should then, once you press tab again, allow you to autocomplete the (old).\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that the final command after autocompletion will look like:\ncp Desktop\\ \\(Old\\)\n\nAs parentheses are also special characters, like spaces.\n\nA: You don't \"choose\", you just keep typing. The Tab completion will stop as soon as it finds the 1st character that is different in the two files. So, using your example, you'd see\n$ cd Desktop\nDesktop/       Desktop (old)/ \n$ cd Desktop\n\nYou just need to keep typing. However, you have chosen to use strange names that contain spaces and parentheses. This is a bad idea since it makes them harder to deal with. To enter a space as part of the file name (it is normally taken to signify the end of a word or file name) you need to escape it with a backslash (\\). So, in this case, you'd need to write \\ (that's \\Space) and then hit Tab again:\n$ cd Desktop\nDesktop/       Desktop (old)/ \n$ cd Desktop\\ ##<--- hit Tab again here\n\nIt will magically complete to \n$ cd Desktop\\ \\(old\\)/\n\nNote how the parentheses will be automatically escaped as well. \n\nThe above is how Ubuntu's default shell (bash) works. Other shells let you hit Tab again to cycle through the available options. For example, both zsh and fish let you cycle through and choose the one you want. Both are in the repositories so you might want to check them out. \n", "Q: how to hide files using ubuntu GNOME Does renaming file with a name which starts with a dot hides files in ubuntu GNOME.\nI have done the same but whenever i restart nautilus the hidden files reappear is this a bug\n\nA: You toggle on/off between \"Show Hidden Files\"/\"Hide Hidden Files\" using CTRL + H. Toggle it off by pressing Ctrl + H and then restart your PC. Now, do you see your hidden files anymore? Please comment. \n", "Q: Why ubuntu distribution? Why other distributions such as mint, elementary,... wait always ubuntu to release, so they could release their own distributions?\n\nA: Those distributions are Ubuntu based. They must wait for Ubuntu release to start build their distributions on top of it.\n\nA: They modify each release of Ubuntu to arrive at their own releases. Thus, even though there are development versions, since their work is dependent on (but not part of) the Ubuntu release cycle, there's always a gap between a release of Ubuntu and the corresponding releases of Linux Mint and others. Since they base themselves off Ubuntu, they have to ensure that package version and other changes should be reflected properly. For example, Debian voted to chose systemd as the default init system, and Ubuntu followed soon. Now, in the next release, Ubuntu will pick up the changes that have been made for systemd compatibility from Debian jessie and apply them to Ubuntu. The others will then use this release to work on.\nNote, for instance, LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition): It is based on the Debian testing, which is a rolling-release distribution. In a rolling distribution, you don't have discrete releases, but a steady stream of updates. Linux Mint discretizes these packages into tested update packs, but not new releases as such. Thus, LMDE has nothing to do with Ubuntu's release cycle.\n", "Q: How to install Stack Applet? I am trying to install Stack Applet. I followed the instructions in this question. To be specific I used the following \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/george-edison\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install stackapplet\npython /usr/share/stackapplet/stackapplet.py &\n\nWhen I start Stack Applet via the Dash, nothing happens. (i.e. no window opens.) I tried restarting my computer and starting Stack Applet but that also did not work. How do I install Stack Applet?\nEDIT: I tried using Ubuntu Software center with no luck.\nMy interface looks like so\n\nA: I recommend you to uninstall your original install of Stack Applet. Then, reinstall it using the Ubuntu Software Center as it is very easy and it worked perfectly for me. I did so in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\n*edit \n\n\nA: I'm the author of StackApplet, so hopefully I can help shed some light on what's going on here.\nFirst of all, the version in the Software Center is currently broken. This is because Stack Exchange recently shut down version 1.x of their public API (which StackApplet used). Right before this happened, I updated the source code and release StackApplet 1.5.2, which I have tested and can confirm works on Ubuntu 14.04.\nSecondly, the new version is available in a PPA, but not the one you included in your question. You need to add the following PPA to your system:\n ppa:stackapplet-dev/stackapplet\nAfter installation, you can confirm that you have the correct version installed by using:\ndpkg -s stackapplet | grep Version\n\nAfter this is complete, you should be able to run the application directly from the dash.\n\nEdit: you may also be missing the python-appindicator package. You can make sure it is installed by running the following command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install python-appindicator\n\n\nA: I installed the latest version via ppa:stackapplet-dev/stackapplet as advised, just to find out the problem still resides in the code as I am writing this. A quick check shows the core of the problem you (and I) are experiencing: stackapplet is failing to authorize via the following URL:\nhttp://stackauth.com/1.0/sites?key=_qlxmEAOH06hLA1_FsZIGQ&jsonp=jQuery1 … 4&_=1 …\n\nThe call results in a 404 - Not Found.\nUntil @nathan-osman (the author) fixes this, or someone else steps in to do the job, there is little hope in being able to use StackApplet.\nFor informational purposes, here’s a screenshot showing the 404…\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to get expandable list items back in Nautilus?

What does this mean and how do I fix it?\n\nA: The error notice means you told cp to copy files and not directories. The warning is about cp finding a directory and informing you it will be skipped.\nIf you want directories: cp -r means recursive and this option will make cp also include subdirectories. \n\nSo your command needs to be:\ncp -r /media/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/orlandocampoverde/Desktop\\ ...\n\n\nRegarding comment: \n-u, --update\n          copy only when the SOURCE file is  newer  than  the  destination\n          file or when the destination file is missing\n\n", "Q: How to add an account to StackApplet?

It accepts three groups of options, represented as --- --- ---. The first set of --- is User. The second is Group and the last is Other (everyone else).\nr stands for Read, w for Write and x for eXecute.\nTo allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to read and write it would be -rw- rx- r--. This would be added to the command as:\nchmod +rw-rx-r-- /path/to/file.extension\n\nchmod also can do this in numbers. It is based on binary.\nSo there are these numbers:\nExecute by user is 100.\nExecute by group is 010.\nExecute by other is 001\nWrite by user is 200.\nWrite by group is 020.\nWrite by other is 002.\nRead by user is 400.\nRead by group is 040.\nRead by other is 004.\nThen you add these together to get the desired combination.\nSo to allow everyone to read it, but only Group to execute and User to write it would be 400 + 040 + 004 and 010 and 200\nThat adds up to 600 + 050 + 004 = 654.\nYou could then run the command.\nchmod +654 /path/to/file.extension\n\nto set it. So to set all permissions you can run:\nchmod +rwxrwxrwx /path/to/file.extension\n\nor\nchmod +777 /path/to/file.extension\n\nFinally, you can do:\nchmod -777 /path/to/file.extension\n\nTo take all permissions away from everyone.\nAnd:\nchmod +300 /path/to/file.extension\n\nTo add read and write for the user, without affecting any other permissions (e.g. Execute permissions).\nThis website has a very useful little tool, whereby you can tick the options you want and it gives you the command:\n\nHowever, not all the possible combinations are sensible to use; the main ones that are used are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*755 - Owner has all, and Group and Other can read and execute\n\n*700 - Owner has all\n\n*644 - Owner can read and write, and Group and Other can read\n\n*600 - Owner can read and write\nAnd, if you're using non-trivial user groups:\n\n\n*\n\n*775 - Owner can read and write, and Group and Other can read\n\n*770 - Owner and Group have all, and Other can read and execute\n\n*750 - Owner has all, and Group can read and execute\n\n*664 - Owner and Group can read and write, and Other can just read\n\n*660 - Owner and Group can read and write\n\n*640 - Owner can read and write, and Group can read\n777 and 666 are rarely used, except in /tmp.\nThanks Ilmari Karonen for pointing out the ones in common usage!\n", "Q: Using Xmodmap, my shift lock now acts as both a shift lock and a compose key.

To change the modifier keys the best way is to go through the configuration utilities. \nI can answer for Ubuntu Gnome --- you should be able to see the equivalent in Unity. \nAs incredible as it can seems, it has to be set in two different places with two different programs --- given that to \"simplify\" the settings interface part of the switches have been moved to the gnome-tweak-tool application. \nStep 1: open gnome-tweak-tool, and in Typing, set: \nNote that by default the menu option says disabled, that means that no tweak is done to Caps Lock, not that it is disabled --- to disable it you have to choose \"Caps Lock is disabled\".

Also switching the \"graphics\" to \"fast\" and \"smooth lighting\" to \"off\" will help a lot. You can also switch the \"clouds\" off.\nAlso a big ammount of entities could affect the game heavily. If arround you are a lot of mobs (e.g. mob spawner) or dropped items (they despawn after some minutes). Horses, boats, carts, villagers (if there are a lot of them it could be verry buggy) are entities too. Arrows are also entities and in a lot of cases they could cause crashes too, if for example you spawn hundreds/thousands of them.\nOne more Problem could be custom datapacks that have big resolutions. If you use them, they consume a lot of power. So for a lower-end pc better use the standart package.\n", "Q: HDMI port has stopped working on 12.04 LTS I have been using 12.04 LTS with an HDMI monitor for quite some time now and everything has been working wonderfully. However, recently my HDMI port has stopped working, and I have been all over these and other forums without finding a solution.\nI know that the the HDMI cable and the monitor aren't the problem because I have swapped out both these pieces of hardware with no change. I am using an HP Envy laptop. The CPU is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz. I am using that CPUs graphics chip - Intel® HD Graphics 4400. I do not have a dedicated graphics card.\n:$ xrandr\n\n    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 32767 x 32767\n    eDP1 connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 193mm\n    1366x768       60.0*+   40.0  \n    1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n    1024x768       60.0  \n    800x600        60.3     56.2  \n    640x480        59.9  \n\nThe above information proves that the system is not aware of the HDMI port hardware, and only the laptops display. It feels to me as if the HDMI port drivers are no longer working.\nMight anyone know how to help me fix this? Do I need to reinstall drivers, or install a different kernel?\n\nA: I have fixed it. I ended up plugging it into a monitor with a lower resolution and was able to then enable the second monitor in the Systems Settings -> Screen Display window and then it worked with the original 1080p monitor again.\n", "Q: Dual boot 3 Ubuntu Based Systems and a bootloader using Virtual Hard Disks I know this sounds crazy, but I want to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install PloP Linux on my current Lubuntu 14.04 system\n\n*Create a new 450 GB Ext4 partition on my external drive and put my home folder there \n\n*Create another Ext4 Partition (50 GB) and put a 45 GB Virtual Hard Drive for Ubuntu 14.04 and Zorin OS 8, followed by a 5GB Virtual Hard Drive for PloP Linux.\n\n*Dual boot my Lubuntu install with Zorin OS and Vanilla (Unity) Ubuntu\n\n*And have my home folder auto-mount when booting into any of the OS's. \n\n\nThat's alot to do, but the result should make the perfect desktop out of an old junkyard computer that I have upgraded over the years. \nSo, in the process: How do I get GRUB to give me two seconds to select any of the OS's on the Virtual Hard Disks or my main Hard Disk before booting into Lubuntu? \nAnd if Zorin OS doesn't ask if you want to upgrade like Ubuntu does, how can I upgrade it?\n\nA: You can change GRUB settings manually through the config file, or a GUI program (Both are described in answer linked directly below).\nThere is a community post here How do I change the GRUB boot order? , which points to the direction I believe you are looking for (and a little more). \nZorinOS is Debian/Ubuntu based, so if using apt you could probably use apt-get upgrade, for the packages on your system but I cannot be sure. For the OS the ZorinOS website has this as a ReadMe.\n\nA: Virtual disks do not need to be separate partitions, and would be much better if they are not.  A Virtual Disk is mainly just one big file that can be attached to any VM on any computer.\nFor your home directory, I would suggest not mounting it directly as ~/home; what I do in this case is to create a data partition that gets mounted, and that contains directories such as \"Pictures\", \"Music\", \"Documents\", \"Downloads\", etc.  I then create sybolic links in any home directory that I have available, and they act just like the standard ones.  \nBy using this method you don't mix up configuration files for various distros, although you will probably need to duplicate some personal settings.  Mostly, this is not a big deal, although you can use links for some of the ones that change a lot, such as browser folders.\nAs far as Zorin OS goes, I would be pretty surprised if it didn't ask about upgrades like Ubuntu.\n", "Q: The \"size\" field in directory entry meaning for directories? I'm looking at low-level directory structure of a disk partition, formatted as \"vfat\" filesystem. The directory entry structure I use is:\nstruct __attribute__ ((packed)) Dentry\n{\n  char          name[11];\n  Attr          attr;\n  uint8_t       reserved;\n  uint8_t       ctimeTenth;\n  Time          ctime;\n  Date          cdate;\n  Date          adate;\n  uint16_t      clusterHi;\n  Time          mtime;\n  Date          mdate;\n  uint16_t      clusterLo;\n  uint32_t      size;\n};\n\nSo, the last four bytes of the directory entry should represent size of file or directory in bytes. However, in my experiments directory entries for directories (not files) always have zero in the size field. For example, this is dd dump of my root directory with one file and one non-empty subdirectory (named qqq):\n00000000  42 65 00 65 00 66 00 66  00 66 00 0f 00 fe 00 00  |Be.e.f.f.f......|\n00000010  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff 00 00 ff ff ff ff  |................|\n00000020  01 61 00 61 00 61 00 62  00 62 00 0f 00 fe 62 00  |.a.a.a.b.b....b.|\n00000030  63 00 63 00 63 00 64 00  64 00 00 00 64 00 65 00  |c.c.c.d.d...d.e.|\n00000040  41 41 41 42 42 42 7e 31  20 20 20 20 00 64 43 60  |AAABBB~1    .dC`|\n00000050  d1 44 d1 44 00 00 43 60  d1 44 04 00 0b 00 00 00  |.D.D..C`.D......|\n00000060  41 71 00 71 00 71 00 00  00 ff ff 0f 00 3d ff ff  |Aq.q.q.......=..|\n00000070  ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ff ff 00 00 ff ff ff ff  |................|\n00000080  51 51 51 20 20 20 20 20  20 20 20 10 00 00 20 79  |QQQ        ... y|\n00000090  d1 44 d1 44 00 00 20 79  d1 44 09 00 00 00 00 00  |.D.D.. y.D......|\n000000a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n\n(Bytes with size are 0x9c - 0x9f)\nCould you please explain me why this size is zero? Or may be, somebody could point me to a doc, describing vfat directory entries with more details?\n(I'm on Ubuntu 3.11.10.3, running as a guest OS in VMWare Fusion on Mac)\n\nA: A directory is not actually a file, but a logical way for a system to organize itself. The way the directories would be stored (depending on the file system) in some sort of table. For example: FAT uses a F ile A llocation T able.\nSo the size of the directory would be dependent upon the amount of space it takes up in that table, more directories equal larger table(s). It may be just a couple bytes. \nI could be wrong on some points, but I am pretty sure this is why you are not seeing the size in the hex (as it is mostly a pointer).\n", "Q: How can I remove matlab on Ubuntu 14.04 I can't uninstall matlab from my Ubuntu 14.04.

Whenever you encounter things like this, back up your data (if necessary) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, before further checks! \nThen I would first look at the SMART indications to see if there's anything failing. If so, chuck it out and replace disk. If not, repairing bad blocks generally speaking leaves a few corrupt files and to repair such situation costs a lot of time. Just restart your install with a full format and (if necessary) restore data from backup.\nKeep your SMART tools handy to keep monitoring the disk. This might just be an indication of bad things to come... or you might just have been unlucky, had a power-cut, power-fluctuations, virus activity or something else that messed with your disk. I've seen things like this happen because of a bad power supply too. \nIf you suspect an issue with a PSU, you can always test it if you have the necessary tools, or you can obtain a PSU-tester for a few $'s (http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/f/powersupplytest.htm). If it is your PSU, you should replace it before it does damage to your more expensive parts like mobo, cpu, gpu, ssd, ram, ...\n", "Q: OpenMP activation on geany I am new to parallel programing and C, and was wondering how to active openMP on geany or another C program on linux?\nIt is a simple hello world i am trying to make:\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <omp.h>\n\n    int main()\n   {\n      #pragma omp parallel\n      {\n         int ID=0;\n         printf(\"hello(%d)\",ID);\n         printf(\"world(%d) \\n\",ID);\n      }\n   }\n\nBut when compile i get some warnings, and can imagen i havent activated or set my compiler correctly.\n\nA: *\n\n*OpenMP g++ option missing while compiling, with -Wall you should see this message:\nwarning: ignoring #pragma omp parallel [-Wunknown-pragmas]\n       #pragma omp parallel\n ^\n\n\n*In command line, add -fopenmp\ng++ -fopenmp -Wall openmp_test.cpp\n\n\n*Using Geany:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new project\n\n*Go to Project → Properties → Build tab\n\n*Add -fopenmp to C++ compile & build commands, respectively:\ng++ -fopenmp -Wall -c \"%f\"\ng++ -fopenmp -Wall -o \"%e\" \"%f\"\n\n\nReference: Wikipedia - OpenMP\n", "Q: Does the mlocate.db generated by my updatedb cron job also applies to 'find'? Reviewing the find man pages for Linux and for Unix, I came across the fact that the mlocate.db seems to apply to 'find' based searches as well as to 'locate' executions in certain flavors of Ux. So an 'updatedb' cron job would benefit both command searches in terms of speed.\nI could not corroborate that for the Linux Bash environment.\nHow is it in either a POSIX compliant or a non POSIX compliant Bash environment for Linux-Ubuntu ? \n\nA: As far as I know, they're both different commands (locate & find) and work separately from each other.\nlocate will check the mlocate.db database to see if a file is registered. If you have new files and updatedb hasn't run, your locate will not show any of the new files you're looking for.\nfind on the other hand, will recursively go through the given path to check which files are currently there. Whenever a new file is placed in the path, find will return it. This proves that find does not rely on the mlocate.db file.\n", "Q: ppscsi patch for 3.x kernel (14.04) progress/availability??

On Minecraft CPU quickly goes up to 85 and more but fan is still one level lower than it is under Windows 7 when CPU reaches 79C. I always thought that fan is controlled by BIOS because I couldn't control it in Win 7 but now it seems that OS can actually control it. I'm not sure about that though. Also, I can't control screen brightness when Ubuntu is powered on, but I can change it when the Acer logo on boot up is shown. Maybe fan and brightness have some connection in this issue.\nMy laptop:\nAcer Aspire 5830G\ni7-2620m 2.7ghz,\nGT 540M 2GB, driver 331.38,\n8GB DDR3 1333\nI really want to use Ubuntu instead of Windows but this prevents me from doing it completely.

I would like to import an arbitrary GIT branch (NOT master) into a Bazaar repo on Launchpad, but when requesting a new code import Launchpad by default imports the HEAD of the master branch. So how can I import, for example, the 2.1.x branch of the LyX GIT repository, if the URL for the repo is git://git.lyx.org/lyx? \n\nA: To import the 2.1.x branch of the LyX GIT repo, when requesting a new code import on Launchpad you need to append ,branch=$NAME to the GIT repo URL.

In the Ubuntu operating systems the properties have a permissions tab, under the permissions tab it says I am not the owner and I can not change the permissions from the current \"ROOT\". It will not let me write to the diskette with my administrator profile.(excuse me! but I am the owner of all the content on my floppy diskettes).\nI know enough to know that \"USER\" usage of a floppy diskette on a personal computer is identical to permissions associated with a common flash drive (i.e. pen drive).\nHow do I remove the lockout permissions on the floppy drive to be able to write to it?\n\nA: You were able to get Ubuntu to read and write floppies?  Good job! I've tried and have not succeeded.  When I need to change file permissions, I use Nautilus/Files in SUDO mode. I know people caution about using Nautilus as SUDO/root. I just make sure I'm making changes to the correct file in the correct folder. To change file permissions using Nautilus, just right-click the file in question, select 'properties' then click the 'permissions' tab.\n", "Q: Computer overheats and shuts down kubuntu My dad has been recomending me to get linux for a long time. Recently I got a driver error on Windows 8, it escalated and now Windows will not boot up anymore. My dad told me to get Kubuntu so atleast I didn't have a dead computer. Ever since I got it, my computer has gotten VERY hot. When I play games from Steam like Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2, etc. my computer will get very hot (this has never happened before) and it will get so hot it will shut off, crash, \"blow a fuse,\" whatever you want to call it. Just on the Internet it's hot.\nI don't know what to do anymore.\nIt is not the battery being in my laptop when it is plugged in.\nIf anyone knows please help me out thanks! Ask Questions if you have any.\nP.S. I have Kubuntu 14.04 and have gotten the most recent software update as of 6/17/14\n\nA: I have the same problem on my laptop HP Compaq nx8220 with Kernel 3.13.0-24 to 3.13.0-30 (in Ubuntu 14.04 and Linux Mint 17). This laptop ran Ubuntu and now Mint since 8 years without overheating problems.\nTry to boot from an older Live-DVD or USB stick with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or Linux Mint 13. If this will fix your CPU fan then a bug in kernel 3.13.x might cause the problem.\nI was able to fix it today with a pre-release of kernel 3.13.0-32 from https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nCareful users should wait a few days to get this fixed kernel as a normal update!\nFrom what I have read the problem was a kernel patch called \"ACPI / AC: convert ACPI ac driver to platform bus\" which has now been reverted in kernel 3.13.0-31 and higher.\n\nA: To talk for sure whether it is hardware or software issue you should have a bit more things checked. The pure experiment would be ideally to resurrect your Windows and check whether it overheats or doesn't. \nAs you said you got the Windows issue with driver, it stopped working/booting, and then you ran Ubuntu, well, it doesn't exclude that your machine had been already overheating somehow by that time. Anyway, to exclude potential fault of Ubuntu and its particular kernel you should run something else on your laptop. You can try Live CD. In there you can select \"Try\", not \"Install\". Or revive your Windows again to compare. You will need to repair a boot however if you do this.\nTo dig deeper into diagnosing of this issue, and namely, to define whether it is software or hardware you can install some OS( say previous Ubuntu version, or Windows) on the new partition of your local drive, or to external drive or on USB flash.\nMoreover, you are recommended to install CPU temperature monitor, for examplepsensor\n(it shows hardware sensors and fan speeds)\nsudo apt-get install psensor \nto check your CPU temperature. Other wise you will need to go to BIOS \"health\" monitor to see it every time the system crashes when it is hot. You need the value to understand what happens.\nYou will probably find that your CPU overheats and goes up to 100C+. If it happens on all OS/kernel's combinations, this means it is a hardware issue. This may involve a number of things, from fan getting bad, dust, dirt and even to to the CPU degrading.\nAnyway you will probably find usefull indicator-cpufreq program, which allows you to scale CPU frequency - to set it down (list is offered in there).\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nA: You may want to try back porting to an older kernel. That seems to be a known bug in the more recent versions Kubuntu.\n", "Q: Wine not responding at all I installed WINE in order to play some older games that Windows no longer supported.

On my computer I have dual boot Win 7 and Xubuntu 14.04 64-bit. Tonight I switched over to Xubuntu to work on something. When I fired up Firefox it acted like I didn't have an internet connection. Dropbox wouldn't connect either, however Spotify would play. \nI am hardwired to my router. I checked UFW and found a whole slew of ports that said were being used by dnsmaq.

It showed the same behavior. Web browsers acted like there wasn't an internet connection, Software Updater wouldn't download packages. It said to check my internet connection. I turned on my wireless hotspot on my phone and connected both computers to it. Connected to my phone I have internet access again. \nI can't figure out what dnsmasq is doing or if it is conflicting with something. The only thing I can think of is that I configured network manager and my router to use OpenDNS servers. Could there be a conflict with that?

According to this article http://xmodulo.com/2012/12/how-to-us...u-desktop.html, dnsmasq conflicts with custom DNS settings so you have to disable dnsmasq first then add in the custom DNS servers to network manager.

The steps involved to install this (for future users who have problems are as follows)\nsudo apt-get install php5-imap\nsudo php5enmod imap\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: To answer the question if there's a particular reason for it, yes there is ;) You can interface Apache with PHP in several ways (mod_php, cgi, fcgi, scgi, php-fpm, cli ...). And you can use multiple of those server APIs (SAPIs) on the same machine in parallel and decide by site / vhost which to use (considering issues like performance, security or compatibility). \nIf PHP modules would get activated just by installation, they would get activated across all available SAPIs. But what if you need to differentiate? Maybe you want a module available for php-fpm (because you set up sufficient security checks there), but not from the command line cli interface? Or you want to configure the module in different ways for different SAPIs. Or you just need to temporarily de-activate a module while somebody's running an attack on your server, and don't want to loose the configuration you worked a day to setup and finetune.\nTo do those things, there's a structure of directories and config files under /etc/php5. And quite similar to that what a2ensite / a2dissite do for Apache vhosts and what a2enmod / a2dismod do for Apache modules, you can manage PHP modules with phpenmod / php5dismod.\n", "Q: How to make a ISO image from a Bootable DVD in windows?

As Sneetsher explained, the VM does not have direct access to the host's NIC.\nFrom the VirtualBox Documentation (Chapter 6):\n\nNote\nBridging to a wireless interface is done differently from bridging to a wired interface, because most wireless adapters do not support promiscuous mode. All traffic has to use the MAC address of the host's wireless adapter, and therefore VirtualBox needs to replace the source MAC address in the Ethernet header of an outgoing packet to make sure the reply will be sent to the host interface. When VirtualBox sees an incoming packet with a destination IP address that belongs to one of the virtual machine adapters it replaces the destination MAC address in the Ethernet header with the VM adapter's MAC address and passes it on. VirtualBox examines ARP and DHCP packets in order to learn the IP addresses of virtual machines.\n\nSince you use static IP addressing, VirtualBox can't learn from DHCP packets (please post host, VM and gateway addresses, it could be a trivial error).\nPlease use DHCP instead so VirtualBox can learn the guest address.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n", "Q: Adding two single Cluster Controller to a MaaS Region Controller I'd like to realize an infrastructure using Ubuntu 14.04Lts like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 Region Controller (RC), Ubuntu 14.04 Server Edition\n\n*2 Cluster Controller(CC), Ubuntu 14.04 Server Edition\n\n\nMaaS has been installed via Ubuntu ISO and then upgraded using ppa stable, while on two Cluster Controller I've installed only maas-cluster-controller and maas-dhcp maas-dns. \nAll Servers are on the same network. \nWhen I try to add the two CC on the RC I don't see any pending cluster\n\nI've found this solution Connect cluster controller to the region controller (MaaS) but when I tried to run this command \n$: sudo maas-provision install-shared-secret\nI've received this error\nusage: __main__.py [-h] [-c FILENAME]\n                   {atomic-write,customize-config,generate-dhcp-config,install-uefi-config,start-cluster-controller,upgrade-cluster}\n                   ...\n__main__.py: error: invalid choice: 'install-shared-secret' (choose from u'atomic-write', u'customize-config', u'generate-dhcp-config', u'install-uefi-config', u'start-cluster-controller', u'upgrade-cluster')\n\nI've also found this command on the changelog of MaaS  (http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/changelog.html), the note says that:\n\"RPC security.

Take the ps command for one example:\nTo see every process on the system using standard syntax:\n      ps -e\n      ps -ef\n      ps -eF\n      ps -ely\n\nTo see every process on the system using BSD syntax:\n      ps ax\n      ps axu\n\nSo what is the difference between these two routes? In general when they say in BSD syntax what elements I should remember? Is this syntax just for those commands which they are in the BSD also?\n\nA: This dates back to the somewhat tortuous history of Unix (Wikipedia has a simplified diagram, which is far from complete). In particular, for a while, there were two major currents: System V developed by AT&T, and BSD developed at the University of California, Berkeley. This was around the early 1980s, long before Linux (1991), let alone Ubuntu (2004). Often these two currents made different decisions, and even today you'll find the occasional reference to “System V” and “BSD” variants or features.\nThe ps command dates back from one of the first releases of Unix (it wasn't in version 1, the earliest man page I can find online is from version 5 (p.94) in 1974). At the time, ps just had a few options, for example ps a would display all processes instead of just the user's, and ps x would display processes with no terminal attached. You'll note that the options don't start with -: at the time, the convention of using - for options wasn't near-systematic like it is today, it was mostly a thing for commands that took file names as normal arguments.\nOver time, the various strands of Unix extended ps with many more options. The BSD variant chose to retain the original syntax, with no leading -, and a and x still exist today. The System V variant chose to adopt the syntactic convention of - for options, and used different letters (for example ps -e to display all processes). Oracle (formerly Sun) Solaris is an example of a System V variant (Solaris also ships a separate ps executable, in a directory which is not on the default PATH, for applications written with BSD in mind).\nAt the time Linux came onto the scene, the people who used it would often have prior experience of one Unix variant or another. Linux sometimes did things the System V way, sometimes the BSD way, sometimes its own way, either based on technical considerations or based on the experience and tastes of whoever implemented the feature. Linux's ps command started out with BSD-like options, e.g. ps ae to display all processes and include environment variables in the listing. Over time (in the late 1990s, I don't remember exactly when), the authors of Linux's ps added options for people who were used to System V. So today either ps ax or ps -e will list all processes under Linux, and there is even an environment variable (PS_PERSONALITY) to make ps behave more like various Unix old Unix variants, for the sake of old scripts and people with set habits.\nPeople who used several Unix variants didn't like that they'd have to modify their programs and their habits when switching from one Unix variant to another. So there was an effort to standardize a subset of functionality. This led to the POSIX standard (led by the IEEE), which Ubuntu by and large follows. The first edition whose scope included the ps command came out in 1992; this one isn't available online, but the 1997 edition is. For the ps command, like in many other cases, POSIX adopted the System V way of doing things.\nThe ps command's standard syntax is one that is compatible with both System V and POSIX. In addition, that syntax can be said to be standard because it uses - to introduce options by default. Some options exist only in one of the two syntaxes; fortunately they can be mixed in the same call.\nGenerally speaking, “BSD” vs “System V” doesn't have any technical implication. It refers to history: “BSD” is whatever choice BSD made in the 1980s and thereabouts, “System V” is whatever choice AT&T and their partners (especially Sun) made. “POSIX” is whatever choice the IEEE standardization committee made.\n\nA: The 'standard' syntax you're referring to is actually the GNU operating system that was developed in the 1980s. GNU-based utilities and philosophy were combined with the Linux kernel in order to develop most modern day Linux distributions (including Ubuntu).\nThe BSD operating system was developed in the late 1970s, independent of GNU, and later branched into modern day versions like FreeBSD or OpenBSD.\nBoth GNU and BSD are inspired by Unix and they have slightly different philosophies, syntax, etc.\n\nA: What's the difference between MS Office and LibreOffice? Between Firefox and Chrome?\nThey do roughly the same thing, but they're by different people with slightly different aims.\nPerhaps the better question is why do BSD, Linux, OSX and Unix distributions share so many commands? This boils down to POSIX compliance. POSIX is basically a set of standards for Unix-like operating systems; it stipulates the core API, the commands and how those commands should work.\nIn the case of ps (a POSIX-stipulated command) certain arguments are demanded. These include these BSD ones. All the POSIX-derived commands have their own man pages but they need a separate install. For ps:\nsudo apt-get install manpages-posix\nman 1posix ps\n\nSo why isn't BSD using our ps (or vice versa)?\n\n\n*\n\n*Our ps package (procps see: dpkg -S $(which ps)) is a fork of another procps package. Both these are GPL licensed. This is incompatible with BSD's license so can't be included there. (We could include BSD's but don't need to).\n\n*ps is fairly kernel specific. I reckon they're technically incompatible. \n\n\nWhat about other applications?\nMost of the commands for POSIX compliance come from Ubuntu's coreutils package. This package represents the GNU in GNU/Linux and it too is GPL licensed. BSD ships its own BSD-compatible-licensed versions that adhere to POSIX but aren't necessarily completely the same as their GNU counterparts.\nps isn't the only POSIX command that isn't GNU. There are loads of them.\nAs I lead with, why should they be? They're by different people over a very, very long time. That's the short answer here.\n\nA: Ubuntu's coreutils is a collection of GNU-maintained applications that inclues a whole load of stuff (look at apt-cache show coreutils).

So could i find the libboost_thread.so.1.49.0 \nThanks a lot.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 14.04, there are two versions of Boost: 1.54.0 and 1.53.0. 1.49.0 is not available.\nInstead, you can install Ogre from the main repos (either libogre-1.8-dev or libogre-1.9-dev, depending on which version you want to develop on). This will ensure that when you upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu, the libraries that you use will be linked against the same version of libraries that are in the main repo. You'll only have to recompile your application.\n", "Q: How do I make Apache serve a single static page no matter what the entered URL is? I'm making an advertisement blocking DNS server that redirects all the advertisement domains to an instance of Apache. So something like\nwww.addomain.com\n\ngets redirected to\ndnsserver.localnetwork\n\nHowever, occasionally I come across links more like\nwww.addomain.com/some_ad\n\nwhich gets redirected to \ndnsserver.localnetwork/some_ad\n\nwhich doesn't even exist and hence raises a 404 error.\nI was hoping that there would be some way to make Apache serve index.html, regardless of the actual request. Otherwise, if you have an alternate solution that does not involve Apache, I'm up for that too.\n\nA: You need a rewrite rule in your .htaccess file.  Something like the following should work:\nRewriteRule ^*$  http://www.addomain.com/index.html [R=301,NC,L]\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu, make sure mod_alias is enabled:\nsudo a2enmod alias\n\nThen in your VirtualHost directive you can use AliasMatch.\nExample:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/host\n    ServerName yourdomain.com\n    DirectoryIndex index.html\n\n    AliasMatch ^/(.*)$ /path/to/your/host/index.html\n\n    <Directory \"/path/to/your/host\">\n      Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNow everything gets redirected to /index.html.\n\nA: Another more simple option would be to change the 404 error page to the static page that you want to show for all pages on your site. So, look for this line (or something similar) in your apache2 configuration files:\nErrorDocument 404 /errors/not_found.html\n\nAnd change the \"/errors/not_found.html\" to: \"/index.html\"\n", "Q: Panel icons disappear at startup Icons sometimes disappear from the Panel notification area when Ubuntu 14.04 starts up. Not the same icon disappears every time, and only one icon disappears at a time. This happens infrequently, and I have also seen it happen on older versions of Ubuntu. The next time I start up Ubuntu, all of the Panel icons are back in the notification area of the Panel where they should be.\nHere are some examples of icons that have disappeared from the Panel notification area at startup.\n\n*\n\n*battery indicator\n\n*network indicator\n\n*Thunderbird Mail\n\n*sound\n\n*clock\n\n*icon (gear in Unity /  in GNOME) for accessing functions such as Lock/Log Out/Suspend/Restart/Shut Down, etc. from a dropdown menu\n\nAll of these icons have disappeared from the Panel at least once, however the indicator icon for Psensor temperature monitor application which usually takes about one minute after startup to appear on the Panel notification area has never disappeared from the Panel at startup.\nHow can I make a missing Panel icon reappear without rebooting the operating system? I would prefer a general solution that works for any of the missing icons in the list.\n\nA: It happens to me to from time to time. I don't know the cause.\nTo make the missing panel indicators reappear without rebooting you can restart the indicators manually by running the following command in a terminal or with Alt+F2\nrestart unity-panel-service  \n\nThe panel indicators will blink off for a second, and then all of the panel indicators will restart and immediately reappear.\nIn Ubuntu 15.04 and later restart the panel indicators manually by running the following command:\nsystemctl --user restart unity-panel-service   \n\nIn Ubuntu 17.10 and later GNOME has replaced Unity as the default desktop environment.

(where suggest-command is example of suggestion of command.)\nHow to do that?\n\nA: After Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, you may want to switch from -e to --, i.e. gnome-terminal -e to gnome-terminal -- because -e and -x are both deprecated.\n\nA: This might be what you run:\ngnome-terminal -- sh -c \"bash -c \\\"!!; exec bash\\\"\"\n\nIn older versions, -e and -x were used:\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"!!; exec bash\\\"\"\n# or\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"!!; bash\"\n\nIt opens gnome-terminal with your last command (!!) executed and it stays open with the command output in the shell, even with an interactive command like top or less...\nIn your case its:\ngnome-terminal -- sh -c \"bash -c \\\"apropos editor; exec bash\\\"\"\n\nor in older versions:\ngnome-terminal -c \"bash -c \\\"apropos editor; exec bash\\\"\"\n# or\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"apropos editor; bash\"\n\n\nA: You could use the -e option to gnome-terminal as follows:\ngnome-terminal -e 'sh -c propose editor'\n\nHere sh is the shell that gnome-terminal opens. Note that this will exit the terminal as soon as the command has terminated. Refer to the manual page for gnome-terminal for more.\n\nA: Each terminal is even a program that you can launch as any other program,\n with & to put in background, giving a list of arguments and so on.\nWhich terminal to use it depends first from the availability of the system that you are using (if they are installed or not), after from their peculiarity and then from your personal taste.\n  konsole   --hold -e \"ls\" &  \n  xterm      -hold -e \"ls\" &  \n  gnome-terminal   -e \"ls\" & ...  \n\nNote the differences between -hold of xterm and --hold of konsole.  \nEach realization has different options that you have to check with the help.\nEven the help can be invoked in different way. \nYou can find that man konsole doesn't function and so you have to ask directly to the executable with --help. \nThis is a list of terminal you can search on your system\naterm          - AfterStep terminal with transparency support\ngnome-terminal - default terminal for GNOME\nguake          - A dropdown terminal for GNOME\nkonsole        - default terminal for KDE\nKuake          - a dropdown terminal for KDE\nmrxvt          - Multi-tabbed rxvt clone\nrxvt           - for the X Window System (and, in the form of a Cygwin port, \n                 for Windows) \nrxvt-unicode   - rxvt clone with unicode support\nxfce4-terminal - default terminal for Xfce desktop \n                 environment with dropdown support\nTerminator     - is a GPL terminal emulator.

Most terminals will exit after running the command you feed them. There are already a dozen or so questions about this on the site:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make a script that opens terminal windows and executes commands in them?\n\n*How to run a script without closing the terminal?\nAn alternative to that is to use an application which needs to be exited. nano will stay open on its own. If you're just outputting to screen, you could pipe it into less:\nxterm -e 'apropos editor | less' & \n\nThat said, in your case (as the other two have said) it does seem easier that you just open another terminal and run your command.\n\nA: Here goes my 50 cents with Terminator:\nterminator -x \"script.sh; bash\"\n\nThis also works, but I can't tell you the difference:\nterminator -e \"script.sh; bash\"\n\nNote that script could also be a command.\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nA: So I know this is like 7 years late, but for anyone else seeing this it should still be helpful. I was having this exact problem too but found a solution that I think is better than what anyone else has suggested.\nPer man gnome-terminal you can just execute gnome-terminal -- sh -c '<your command>'\nThe -- sh allows it to run actual scripts instead of applications, so it would be just like typing it into a normal window. The only thing to note about this solution though is that the terminal will quit after the command is done executing.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Can't install Openjdk 1.6 in ubuntu Accidentally I removed Openjdk from Ubuntu.

After the creation of the new partitions, I've been able to install Ubuntu 14.04 without any problem. It booted regularly, as far as I launched Windows again. Probably some program (McAfee?) has modified my EFI partition, and since that moment I've not been able to launch the \"ubuntu\" entry of UEFI anymore. GRUB failed to load, and the PC lauched the second option of UEFI, i.e. Windows 8.1.\nOf course, I've tried to make a new installation of Ubuntu, but now I get this error when Ubiquity tries to configure Grub2:\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed failed to install into /target/.\nWithout GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot\n\nand then Ubiquity crashes.

So when you feel re-invigorated you can try bcdedit from within Windows. My HP Laptop will now no longer boot to Ubuntu without me changing the path of bootmgr as shown in the first answer here\nAs long as you have a backup of your EFI you can always return to prior state.\n\nA: First, and most importantly, disable Fast Startup in Windows. Some dual-boot instructions tell you to disable a similarly-named feature in the firmware, but that's often unnecessary and is not the same as disabling the Windows feature, whereas disabling the Windows feature is critical for safe dual booting. In your case, it's probably causing data corruption on the partition that holds the boot loader, thus preventing installation to it.\nSecond, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't already done so, disable Secure Boot.\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium with rEFInd.\n\n*Boot that boot medium.

You'll need to install the driver manually in OS X, but it's not difficult -- it's just one file that needs to be copied.

But what you have to do, this to first upgrade to 13.10 and then upgrade to 14.04.\nNote that if you have had a LTS version, like 10.04, 12.04 or 14.04 you can do the upgrade directly to the next LTS version (so upgrading directly from 12.04 to 14.04 would be possible, from 12.10 to 14.04 would not be possible directly).\n", "Q: Where can I find the source code for mounting my digital camera?

Option -type d restricts the search to directory.\nThan perform cp command and copy 1.txt in each file (directory) found.\nIn order to limit find to current directory you should use -maxdepth option:\n   find . -maxdepth 1 -name \"i*\" -type d -exec cp 1.txt {} \\;\n\nYou can use muru's tip and use cp 1.txt i* but this fails in case of multiple i* file, while find command executes cp command multiple times and this can be a problem too.\nSo you should choose one or the other depending on the case and what you need. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - after installation no bootloader, so Windows 7 starts I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 for the first time.\nThere is also working Windows 7 on that PC.\nAfter the installation from Ubuntu 14.04 with an USB-Stick I clicked on \"restart\" and the system told me to unplug the USB-Stick.

I wasn't exactly sure so I created a swap partition 4100MB in size. Now I have swappiness at 0 and it's highly unlikely I'll ever need swap because I don't use any memory intensive apps. I also don't hibernate. My SSD is large enough at 256GB but not huge with half of it used by Win 8.1. Should I shrink swap and if yes to what size or should I get rid of it altogether.\n\nA: 4GB RAM isn't that much actually, if you run chrome or firefox and you have multiple tabs opened for a while you can get to 4GB usage quite quickly. \nYou can monitor your ram usage with the \"System Monitor\" application. If you find that you never really exceed 4GB and your swap remains empty you might consider shrinking it. I wouldn't recommend getting rid of it altogether, since Ubuntu will randomly close applications if you run out of RAM and you have no swap. \nI have installed myself a little indicator which always shows me how much RAM i use, which I find quite handy. You can find the instructions how to install it in this post: https://askubuntu.com/a/40019/255967\n\nA: No specific rule for the optimum size of a swap partition exists. If it did, we'd all be using it and installers would offer to set things up automatically.\nIf a machine has no swap partition and the amount of code and data that attempts to be loaded into memory exceeds the size of that memory , there's a very good chance that things will just stop until the user manages to close something. If the machine does have a swap partition, chuncks of code and data will be written and read to and from the swap file until the demand on RAM decreases. \nAdjusting the size of the partition may affect the number of disk accesses, but it can't work magic. Writing to and reading from a drive is orders of magnitude slower than shuffling bits around in RAM.\nRed hat recommends setting as follows for RHEL 5:\nThe reality is the amount of swap space a system needs is not really a function of the amount of RAM it has but rather the memory workload that is running on that system. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 system will run just fine with no swap space at all as long as the sum of anonymous memory and system V shared memory is less than about 3/4 the amount of RAM. In this case the system will simply lock the anonymous and system V shared memory into RAM and use the remaining RAM for caching file system data so when memory is exhausted the kernel only reclaims pagecache memory.\nConsidering that 1) At installation time when configuring the swap space there is no easy way to predetermine the memory a workload will require, and 2) The more RAM a system has the less swap space it typically needs, a better swap space\nConclusion\nIf Linux kernel is going to use more than 2GiB swap space at a time, all users will feel the heat. Either, you get more RAM (recommend) and move to faster storage to improve disk I/O. There are no rules, each setup and configuration is unique. Adjust values as per your requirements. Select amount of swap that is right for you.\nInstall from the Ubuntu software center> Gnome system monitor.  Select tab where it say\\\nResources . See where you have swap > You can monitor this when you have a lots of applications or huge work load on your CPU to see if or when it is time to increase swap size. I personally have as much swap as i have RAM for specially when you have many app's open your system will be slow.

System : Xubuntu 13.04 x64\nI've found usage of this functionality in ffmpeg here\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf subtitles=subtitle.srt out.avi\n\nbut it doesn't work. I get an error\nNo such filter: 'subtitles'\n\non that. Same thing happens if I replace ffmpeg by avconv.\nSo I tried downloading the libav source here and compile. Again I'm frustrated when I run\n./configure --enable-libass\n\nin the source directory, and this time I got\nUnknown option \"--enable-libass\"\n\nI wonder if this is a very particular thing that avconv doesn't support at all. And \n\nA: Why subtitles filter is missing\nLibav tends to ignore features from FFmpeg, so avconv and their counterfeit \"ffmpeg\" (removed as of 14.04) do not support libass, and therefore does not support the subtitles video filter among many other filters.\n\nHow to fix\nYou have several options to get the real ffmpeg from FFmpeg:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a ffmpeg binary - The easiest option.\n\n*Compile - Allows full customization.\n\n*Use mc3man's PPA - For 14.04 users\n\n*Upgrade your Ubuntu - FFmpeg returned in 15.04\n\n\n\nUsage\nHardsubs\nThis will \"burn\" the subtitles into the video, but of course requires that the video be re-encoded:\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf subtitles=subtitle.srt -codec:a copy output.mkv\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Filters require re-encoding. See the FFmpeg H.264 Encoding Guide for encoding suggestions.\n\n*Since you probably do not want to re-encode the audio this example just stream copies (re-muxes) it.\nSoftsubs\nConsists of a susbtitle stream that is muxed into the file. Any player worth using will allow you to turn the subtitles on and off and choose from other subtitle streams that may be present. Does not require any re-encoding.\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -i subtitle.srt -codec copy -map 0 output.mkv\n\n\nA: ffmpeg is not exactly the same as avconv. See this about burning subtitles with avconv.\nThere is another option, easier and with GUI: Avidemux. Install it with:\nsudo apt-get install avidemux\n\nOpen a video file, then go to Video, choose a video encoder (anything else than Copy), Filters and Subtitles.

How, for example, would you make them all install the same package or remove one, or to install a specific update ahead of an automated upgrade and reboot?\nThere are tools like Landscape (needs a support subscription with Canonical) that makes this side of things a lot easier.\nOther than that, I would start out making sure every machine has an admin user with a specific SSH key installed. You could start with one machine and clone that onto all the others. Once you have that you could use something like clusterssh to address a whole load of computers and run the same on each:\ncssh -a '/usr/bin/benchmark' admin@host1 admin@host2 admin@host3 admin@host4\n\nIf you don't need the long-term installs, you could just magic up a LiveUSB that autoloads your benchmark and sends it off to a central server.

That is. I don't want to have both drivers installed at the same time. I just want to make an init script or whatever which will choose the correct driver for the video card currently installed during the boot.\nI don't think that this is impossible with the *nix ideology that everything is the file. Roughly, I think that should be possible to pack all driver-related files into two archives, amd.tar and nvidia.tar do lspci before video driver is loaded and extract the needed one to the root filesystem.\nThe reason why I need this is that I have a portable installation of the ubuntu which works well on every machine whichever I tried. The only issue with it is in fact that I need to reinstall drivers manually from the recovery mode everytime I use the computer with the graphical card different to the previous one.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: What is the difference between having them \"installed\" and having them as a .tar ?\nHaving them \"installed\" is going to be easier as it then allows the kernel to select the correct driver and load the necessary driver as a kernel module, so, other then making a custom spin, your work is done.\nUsing an archive or tar may save some space, depending on the compression, but you will have to write a script. The script, and all necessary archives, would need to be in the initramfs, including the archives.\nSee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Initramfs.\nSupport for custom kernels and custom initramfs is somewhat limited here.

I would like to have the script run and find all the files that were created yesterday in the snapshots directory (including avi files it has created), and move them into a folder with yesterday's date as the title on it.\nHas anyone tried this before?  Does motion already have this functionality built in and I am just not seeing it?\nThe next step will be to have it auto purge itself after 7-14 days, but that's a whole other post.\n\nA: This is very simply done through find. The relevant options are:\n   -mtime n\n          File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.  See the  comments\n          for -atime to understand how rounding affects the interpretation\n          of file modification times.\n   -atime n\n          File was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  When  find  figures  out\n          how  many  24-hour  periods  ago the file was last accessed, any\n          fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to\n          have been accessed at least two days ago.\n   -exec command ;\n          Execute  command;  true  if 0 status is returned.  All following\n          arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until\n          an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}'\n          is replaced by the current file name being processed  everywhere\n          it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments\n          where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both  of  these\n          constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\\') or quoted to\n          protect them from expansion by the shell.  \n\nSo, to move all jpg files created in the snapshots directory in the last 24 hours, you would run\nfind /home/yourusername/snapshots/ -name '*jpg' -mtime +0 -exec mv {} /path/to/dest\n\nThe {} is replaced by each file name found. QUotes are not necessary since find deals with strange file names gracefully before executing the command. The +0 means \"the file was last modified at least 1*24h ago as explained in the atime section quoted above.\nIf you want to move these to a directory whose name is yesterday's date, you'd have to create it (using the -p option so mkdir does not complain if the directory exists):\nmkdir -p $(date -d yesterday +%F)\n\nThe date command will print yesterday's date in YYYY-MM-DD format. For example, 2014-06-18. You can combine the two commands into the same find -exec call (the \\ after -mtime is only there for readability, it allows you to break a command into multiple lines):\nfind /home/yourusername/snapshots/ -name '*jpg' -mtime +0 \\\n -exec bash -c \"mkdir -p $(date -d yesterday +%F) && mv {} $(date -d yesterday +%F)\" \\;\n\nSo, to run this with cron, you could add a line like this to your crontab (run crontab -e):\n0 9 * * * find /home/yourusername/snapshots/ -name '*jpg' -mtime +0 -exec bash -c \"mkdir -p $(date -d yesterday +%F) && mv {} $(date -d yesterday +%F)\" \\;\n\nThe above would run the find command every day at 9 AM. \n\nA: find /path/to/my/folder/ -type f -mtime -1 -exec ls -l \"{}\" \\;\n\nIf you want to move them, you may change the exec command:\nfind /path/to/my/folder/ -type f -mtime -1 -exec mv \"{}\" /path/to/my/newfolder/ \\;\n\n\"{}\" is the full path to each file name that matched the search.\nThe \\; is required at the end of the command line.\nYou can delete them using -delete:\nfind /path/to/my/folder/ -type f -mtime -1 -delete\n\n", "Q: Can't sync Nokia Lumia 800 on Ubuntu 12.04 I am just started using Ubuntu, and i came up with some issue. \nI have Nokia 800, which runs on Windows phone 7.5 and to sync my files i have to use Microsoft Zune which runs only on MAC and Windows.

Hence, we place high demands on our graphics hardware. This also means that I can't use the Nouveau drivers, since we can't run our software with it.\nWhen I started at this job, I had a 12.10 box, with an AMD FirePro V5900. After leaving the computer on for a few weeks, this problem started to show; and it was soon followed by a host of other issues. These other issues (flickering screen, black windows, and more) are out of the question's scope, as they've been documented elsewhere, but from what I can tell, my problem is unique -- several times I have found pictures of what seems to be other instances of the issue, but closer study (loading the page on another computer) indicates that the glitches are on my end. What I see, whatever I might be doing on the computer, is this:\n\nThese patches (of 2-pixel tall holes) flicker with every redraw, many of them changing positions. I've spent a month working with IT trying to fix the issue, and so far we have tried (in order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrading to 13.10\n\n*Booting into old kernel\n\n*Switching to Gnome 3 (it was worse)\n\n*Switching to Gnome metacity (same as unity)\n\n*Wiping the drive and installing 14.04\n\n*Booting into old kernel\n\n*Swapping out the card for an NVIDIA Quadro 5000, rewiping drive and installing 14.04 again for good measure\n\n*Tried different monitor and cable\n\n*Tearing out all the guts, new mobo, new RAM (a weekend-long memtest turned up fine, but we were taking no chances), everything except the case new; again rewiping drive and reinstalling Trusty.\n\n*Testing with a beautiful new high-dpi monitor\n\n\nNothing worked -- every time, it would look nice and fresh, but it would be useless, so we'd try a driver switch, but after switching to any other driver, the madness returns. The parts are all new (now anyway), and nothing is, or ever has been, overclocked.\nWhat now? In a few hours we're wiping my drive again, this time to try Precise. Honestly, I've lost enough productivity already, so if that doesn't work I'm switching to Mint or Arch or Windows. Right now, I'd rather just document an odd bug, and perhaps get some help putting together a bug report (and filing it in the right place).\nHowever, I may have just kept screwing up in subtle ways with my driver configuration. Since I find that quite likely, I've decided it would be best to ask here. So, any ideas?\n\nA: Ok, seeing you ruled out almost everything,\nWhat about strong electromagnetic interference near the machine?\nPossibly also near the power cables, in case they have issued like incomplete connection to ground locally?\nYou say \"everything except the case [is] new\" - that could be a hint in this direction, as it's the main function of the case to keep these problems out. \nThe other component relevant to handling of electromagnetic interference is the power supply. It actually spends lots of it's complexity on providing well-filtered current, as opposed to just strong current.\n\nA: [Note: I noticed that this solution was already ruled out for the speciffic case at hand (RAM was replaced), but I keep this answer assuming it may be helpful to readers working on similar issues]\nTo me, that looks very much like a memory problem, assuming things like loose connectors were already checked.\nNow, you ruled out the graphics card by changing it, right?\nThat would leave the main memory of the machine.

It should look similar to this:\n\n\n\nHere you can disable or enable Fast Boot and other UEFI Booting releated options if needed.\nIf you installed Ubuntu correctly, there should be an entry called ubuntu. Try to boot that via boot override. If that works, you just need to configure the boot order properly.\nIf there is no such entry or similar, you probably have to either reinstall Ubuntu, register the bootloader via efibootmgr from a live media or install a default UEFI bootloader like gummiboot.\nI currently have one UEFI machine with an Asus motherboard at home (I had 2 a few months back). So it's possible, but I just can't reboot it now to make screenshots of my settings. Anyway hope this helps you.

Use f5 and f6 to rearrange to your liking and click f10 to save it. If you use multi boot and only see one Linux distro in your grub menu, enter Linux and use \nsudo grub-update \n\n\nA: In my case the solution was:\nsudo su\ncd /boot/efi/EFI\nmv BOOT BOOT_bak\ncp -R ubuntu BOOT\ncd BOOT\nmv shimx64.efi bootx64.efi\n\nThanks to idimopoulos from dell forum\n\nA: First, a complaint that boot files are far from the start of the disk is irrelevant on an EFI-booting computer. There are limits under BIOS (which vary depending on how old the BIOS is), but even under a (modern) BIOS, your 750GB disk should pose no problems.\nSecond, you can change the BootOrder variable with efibootmgr's -o option, as in:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0,1,2\n\nThis command will set the two ubuntu instances first, followed by the Windows Boot Manager entry. That should do the trick. Unfortunately, some EFIs are buggy, and \"forget\" the BootOrder entry or otherwise misbehave. If you have problems, I recommend trying the following command in a Windows Administrator Command Prompt window:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\n(If you've disabled Secure Boot, you can replace shimx64.efi with grubx64.efi, although either should work with Secure Boot disabled.)\nIf that fails, then your firmware is probably defective. There may be an update available from HP. If not, or if it doesn't help, and if you're within the return period for your computer, return it for a refund and get something that's not broken. If you can't do that, then you're into the territory of really ugly workarounds, like renaming GRUB so that it pretends to be the Windows boot loader.

I currently have a single-user system that autoloads into X and starts XBMC via a super-simple Upstart job that runs:\nsu -c \"startx /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/xbmc-standalone -- -bs\" oli\n\nSuper-simple and it works, double-rock-solid... No desktop getting in the way. No window manager to slow down performance. And it bounces back when XBMC crashes (once a day). It's fantastic if all you want to do is use XBMC. But now I'd like to install Steam to play games. This raises some problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Steam and XBMC are going to fight over screen time (there's no window manager, remember) and audio devices. We need to close XBMC before starting Steam but without killing X. Note how XBMC is currently launched. How do I do that?\n\n*It'd also be really grand if I could trigger the XBMC→Steam switchover from my wireless XBox controller. It's hooked in with xboxdrv which has an exec option:\nxboxdrv --ui-buttonmap XBOXBTN=exec:/home/oli/bin/switch.sh\n\nSo assuming #1 can be  scripted, I can hook in.\n\n*The second half of #1. When Steam exists I need XBMC to come back up.\n\n*If whatever's currently running crashes, it needs to be the thing that loads back up.\nSo it seems my biggest problem is monitoring an application. If it exits gracefully (code 0, eg I've asked it to exit, or I've called a script that asked it to exit), it should load the other application and monitor it. If it crashed (not code-zero), it should run the same application and monitor it. Make sense? But how?\nThis all sort of feels like something Upstart would be great for except both are X applications running at user-level. I'm on 14.04 so if it has come far enough, that might be an option.\nThere may also be a way of doing this that's special to XBMC and/or Steam.

The value of root here should be 2, from the contents of the Boot Repair output that you posted. To find out for sure, try rebooting, then press c to get to the command line (as given in the instructions below the GRUB menu) ad try these commands until you see files that belong to the Windows partition:\nls\nls (hd0,1)\nls (hd0,2)\n...\n\nThe output of the first ls will list the partitions as GRUB recognizes them ((hd0,1) instead of sda and so on), so in the next few command you will try the partitions one by one (use the values listed by the first ls instead of (...,...). \nOnce you see the files of Windows, say for ls (hd0,3), then do the following:\nset root=(hd0,3)\nchainloader +1\nboot\n\nIf it boots to Windows successfully, then replace (hd0,2) with (hd0,3) in the menu entry you created previously.

The Ubuntu installation didn't find the windows partition.\nI installed windows on the complete hdd (one partition), then I tried with one partition for windows and no other partition, but still Ubuntu doesn't find windows.\nShould I install ubuntu first?\n\nA: You should always install Windows before Ubuntu or any other Linux distrobution. Ubuntu and the grub boot loader can recognize an installation of Windows, but Windows will never recognize an Ubuntu installation. Install Windows on the entire disk first, then when installing Ubuntu you should get an option to install along side Windows, which will take care of all the paritioning for you. \n\nFor more detail, see WindowsDualBoot in the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki. \n", "Q: Doubt : About Dual Boot(in partition) I have a computer on which all the hard disks are partitioned and are already used by me. Since the newer versions of Ubuntu require a partiton for dualbooting I was thinking of getting another extra hard disk and installing Ubuntu on that particular disk.  Does this seem like the correct thing to do or am I making a mistake somewhere? I would like to know the safest way to do it without affecting anything. Some advice would be helpful since I see a lot of threads where people try to install Ubuntu and the UBuntu boots but the original OS does not.\n\nA: I run a dual-boot, but with lower systems: Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows XP.\nYou don't need another partition for installing Ubuntu. The technical guy who installed Ubuntu on my computer told me almost all Linux distributions make their own little space on your computer. That space is inaccessible through any other OS.\nIn other words, you can install Ubuntu along with your Windows 7 (by choosing the option Install With Windows or something). Ubuntu will automatically make some space and install in that.\nI had four drives (partitions). They all work as they should. There's even the entire C drive in which all my Windows software and even Windows XP itself is installed. There's no problem in accessing.\n\nA: Safest way is to install on a new partition, or hdd entirely.\n", "Q: How do I stop Ubuntu from intercepting the super key when running VMware? I am running VMware with Ubuntu 14.04. The host operating system is Ubuntu 14.04, and the guest is Windows 8.1 Pro. When I briefly press the super key from within VMware, Ubuntu displays the keyboard shortcut overlay, and it does not go away. How do I stop this from happening?\n\nA: Pressing the Super key invokes the Unity Dash.\nPressing and holding the Super key invokes the keyboard shortcut overlay.\nI suspect you are doing the later, based on your description.\nNevertheless, you could change the key used to invoke the Unity Dash using Unity Tweak Tool.  This way, VMware will get your key-press signal immediately, when you press Super.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Unity Tweak Tool\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\n*Launch Unity Tewak Tool.\n\n*In the Unity section, select Additional.\n\n*Click on <Super> next to Show the launcher.\n\n*Select a different key (or key-combination) to invoke the launcher.\n", "Q: How to Uninstall Ubuntu that's triple-boot with Win8 and another Ubuntu version I have Windows 8.1, Ubuntu x64 and Ubuntu x86 installed on my PC.\nOn boot, the main selection is Ubuntu x64\nI want to uninstall Ubuntu x64 now and change the boot menu selection to Ubuntu x86. Ofcourse, still dual-boot with Windows 8.\nCan anyone tell me how to do that?\nOr how to move the bootloader to a different partition?\n\nA: Create a Ubuntu X86 live usb, boot from live usb, delete the ubuntu x64 partition and use grub-repair. To grub-repair use the graphical method in the following link http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\n\nA: Ok, this is kind of troublesome but it has solution. I have done this many times. I hope it works for you.\n1 - Download an ubuntu .iso, and burn it to a dvd (ubuntu desktop versions do not fit on a cd nowadays).\n2 - Boot your computer and choose the CD/DVD boot method where your Ubuntu Install disk is on.\n3 - Select Try Ubuntu instead of install it, this will avoid some troubles because you will have to take further actions.\n3.5 - before deleting the partition you want, first be sure to back up the data. We know that the partition that is deleted is lost forever. You can mount the partition, look for your files, and use an externadl HDD or a big USB, depending on the data you need to back up.\n4 - In the Live CD session look for gparted, look for your Ubuntu x64 parition and delete it. It will leave you a free space, you can use the extra partition in the way you want.\n5 -  Open a Console and type the next:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nthis will show you all the partitions you have right away.\nLets think that your Ubuntu x32 is on /dev/sda3, you will have to mount that partition in order to access the grub, the option screen that let you select the OS partitons some seconds before you turn on the computer.\n6 - Type the next commands one per each line\n sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot\n\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\n\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\n\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys \n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\n7 - Now you have to regenerate the Grub, to make possible to get the active partitions that you need\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/sda\n\n7B - If last step does not work, then try the next ones (It is the old school)\nsudo update -grub2\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n8 - time to finish \nexit\n\n\nsudo reboot\n\nHave a nice booting :-)\nSource --> It is in Spanish, but It works\n", "Q: \"An error was found.

I have 14.04 installed but I have problem with mencoder & mplayer which always want to update to version from 2012\nBut I compiled mencoder & mplayer from sources so I get newest version.\nHow exclude mencoder & mplayer from updating ?? \n\nA: If your system wants to update Mencoder and Mplayer, this is because you have installed them using the packages provided by the Ubuntu software repositories.\nIf you prefer to use the most recent version that you compile yourself from the sources, then you should remove the version provided by Ubuntu :\nsudo apt-get purge mencoder mplayer\n\nAfter doing so, your system will stop managing the update to these software, you will just need to compile from sources yourself each time you need a new recent version.\nUpdated\nAs the OP tells in the comment, he is using the guide provided in the Help Cener of Ubuntu.\nI've reviewed this guide and found out that, yes, this will allow to build the mencoder & mplayer from source but the process described there will also create .deb package out of them and install them as any other Ubuntu package.\nAs seen in the procedure : to compile MPlayer you are asked to add the following parameter to an install command : --pkgversion \"2:1.0~svn$(LC_ALL=C svn info 2> /dev/null | grep Revision | cut -d' ' -f2)\" therefore fixing a version into this package which is inferior to the one found for this package in the repositories.\nThus it is now understandable why after following the tutorial, the software are updated along with any apt-get upgrade.\nSo, or you manually provide an higher value to the version string, or you follow the post referred by the duplicate note in your question to lock the package and avoid they are updated with the system. \n", "Q: avconv incorrect length when splitting video avconv used to work fine for me in 13.10, but now it doesn't.

Is it possible to get a code behind random command, srand and rand commands?\n\nA: Turbo C++ and Gnu G++ (C++) (perhaps LLVM/clang) have different libraries.  Their implementations of rand, srand and many (many!) functions will probably be different in HOW they provide the proper result.\nEvery function in those libraries will produce expected results, open, read, exit and so on. (If they don't, they're not very 'standards conformant').\nSo rand & srand ARE working properly in each environment... they provide (and seed) random numbers.\nHOW they arrive at that result is not defined, there are several methods of creating random numbers (See `Random number generation' for more info on RNG's)\nTherefore, even given the same seed value, you cannot expect different RNG libraries to provide identical output.  This will be true regardless of which source of libraries you use, Microsoft, Solaris, Linux, *BSD's, OSX and so on.\nOnly if the exact same method is used to derive the random numbers can you sort-of expect an identical series.

I reworded the questions for clarity.\nQ: \"Will click packages be safer with regard to the system and user data or will it be the same?\"\nA: In general, click packages are safer than debs with regard to system and user data. \nClick packages do not include maintainer scripts that run as root at installation like deb packages do. Click packages are simply unpacked and then hooks provided by the system are used if declared by the click. For example, the click might declare to use a desktop hook to generate a desktop file or an AppArmor hook to generate an AppArmor profile for the app. Because deb packaging has the concept of maintainer scripts that are designed to allow for extensive customization of the software or the system, deb packages should only be installed from a trusted source, eg a signed archive from a distribution like Ubuntu. Click packages may be installed directly and you can be reasonably sure the package installation won't ruin your system. However, that is only part of the story-- if you install a click package from an untrusted source, there are no guarantees that it will declare in its manifest that it is properly confined, so while installing it is ok, running it may not be (ie, the software may run without confinement and therefore be able to steal your data or run programs as your user).\nThe real power of click is when it is used in combination with a software repository with strong policies. For example, the security of a click package installed from the Ubuntu App Store is typically higher than that of a deb installed from a trusted archive. This is because in the Ubuntu App Store, the trust model is apps are considered untrusted* and policies and checks are in place to ensure that click packages in the store have a proper security manifest and therefore run under very strict confinement. Contrast that to deb packages in the Ubuntu archive-- the trust model is that the software and deb packaging are considered trusted and in general the software does not run under confinement (though there are plenty of exceptions where an AppArmor profile is shipped with the software to guard against security bugs).\n\n\n*\n\n*Trusted packages may also be delivered via the Ubuntu App Store. While uncommon, they are typically developed by Canonical and may or may not run under confinement.\nTo answer your specific questions:\nQ: Is click based on the same system as deb?\nA: The low level package format for click is deb. However, click packaging is much simpler in that it uses a declarative manifest and hooks rather than traditional packaging files and maintainer scripts.\nQ: Can AppArmor provide privileged access to apps without user interaction?\nA: AppArmor is root strong and can allow or deny access to system resources (files, DBus, networking, etc) based on the defined security policy. A click package on its own is not required to ship an AppArmor security manifest or to ship an AppArmor security manifest that is 'safe'. What makes the system secure is the combination of click and the policies of the store that delivers click packages. Click packages delivered via the Ubuntu App Store will use AppArmor policy that is very restrictive and does not allow privileged actions behind the scenes (eg, an app running under this policy can't execute programs on the system behind the scenes, access your facebook account, steal your gpg or ssh keys, manipulate networking, etc) \nQ: Will the user be prompted at install time to grant access rights to the app like on Android? (eg, \"this app is able to scan your /home and access network\")\nA: No. A click package itself may be installed with no prompting using lowlevel tools. On Ubuntu, click packages should be installed via the Ubuntu App store (see the above) and because of the Ubuntu App store policies combined with click capabilities and the Ubuntu system, there is no need for click-through, context-less installation prompts. Ubuntu can do this because apps installed from the Ubuntu App store run under restrictive confinement (ie they can't do bad things behind the scenes) and when an app needs additional access it does so using controlled APIs which may include prompting.\nIn the case of privileged APIs, we have the concept of trusted helpers such that the user will have a contextual prompt to allow or deny the access (with (optional) revokable caching so the user isn't asked each time). For example, if the app needs to access the location-service (a trusted helper), the user will be prompted to allow the access at the time the app tries to use the location-service, which gives context so the user can make an informed decision. The same will happen for video and audio recording. Often, we don't need to have a security prompt at all and we can allow access based on user-driven interactions with the app. Eg, if an app wants to upload an picture there will be a dialog to select the picture. Behind the scenes, because the app isn't allowed to access the ~/Pictures directory, it will use the content-hub API which will launch the gallery file selector for the user to choose a picture to upload. The content-hub then takes the picture from the gallery and gives it to the app. In this manner, there is no security dialog, there is only a natural interaction for the user, but behind the scenes, there is an implied trust decision.\nQ: Related to this question: will .apk and click have similar language with regard to policies and user experiences?\nA: No, there is no installation prompting for the reasons stated above. Android permissions and security permissions for click packages as defined for Ubuntu have some similarities, but are different and implemented differently.\nQ: Specifically, with click, can an app send all my private data over the network without me knowing or will it be confined in some way to prevent this?\nA: If you install a click from an untrusted source, yes, it can do anything. If you install a click from the Ubuntu App Store, no, an app can't send all your data off over the network because it does not have access to it. Of course, an app can appear to do one thing and do another so if a user grants access to the location-service or gives the app access to a picture, then the app can be evil with that data-- but that is where ratings/reviews and App Store security policies come in to effect. If an app like this is reported, it will be investigated. If appropriate, the app will be removed from the store, the app will be removed from any devices where it is installed and the developer's App Store access will be revoked. \nQ: Can it be said that click packages are safer than debs, but less powerful because they are more restricted?\nA: As can be seen from the above, the answer is not that simple. A click by itself may ship software that can do anything. The click packaging format is intentionally general purpose and can be used in any number of ways and is not at all specific to Ubuntu. For Ubuntu, the combination of click, Ubuntu APIs, AppArmor and App Store policies provides a very powerful environment for developers to deliver applications to users in a way that is safe and easy for people to use. The utility of the applications themselves is dependent on the APIs offered to the applications by the underlying system. The initial set of APIs that will be offered on Ubuntu's first shipping phones will allow developers to create all kinds of fun and useful applications using a rich API and SDK. These APIs will expand in their breadth and utility as we move forward to better support developers and users.\n\nA: I will try to answer some of the most important questions regarding security and click packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can an app send all my private data on the network with one click without letting me know it explicitly?\n\n\n*\n\n*Click apps will run under confinement. What this means is that the app is prevented from doing bad things: it can only access its own private directory.\n\n\n*Can apps be installed and then have root rights? without password or specific prompt? \n\n\n*\n\n*...\n\n\n*Will the user be prompted to accept the right of the apps? when?\n\n\n*\n\n*Click apps will access features that the user allows the app to use (NB: prompt not yet on the current/daily Ubuntu Touch release).\n\n\n*Is it based on the same system for both click and deb?\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian (.deb) packaging is completely different. However, if your app is made with the Ubuntu SDK, you don't need to use Debian packaging and can instead use Click packaging, which is much easier to use and much safer for the end user.\n\n\n*Similar as above, to compare: Do .apk (Android) and click work in the same way?\n\n\n*\n\n*Android packages and Ubuntu Click packages will work in a similar way, in that each application will have its own space to store data and that it's (ideally) prohibited from accessing data of other applications directly. Currently, Android packages can also read data from the SD card or internal storage, where there are no access restrictions. Ubuntu Click packages will also have to request permissions for specific features.\n\n\n*It is true to say: click packages are less powerful (restrict more things), but safer?\n\n\n*\n\n*...\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, Click packages are very safe and the review process for publishing them is much simpler.\nSources: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/345217/85273\n", "Q: Error on Synaptic Reload Error on Reloading Synaptic Package Manager. \n\"Could not download all repository indexes.\" \nProblem with Medibuntu repositories. something wicked happened.\n\nHow do i resolve this?\n\"Failed to fetch http://packages.medibuntu.org/dists/precise/Release.gpg  Something wicked happened resolving 'packages.medibuntu.org:http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)\nFailed to fetch http://packages.medibuntu.org/dists/precise/free/binary-amd64/Packages  Something wicked happened resolving 'packages.medibuntu.org:http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)\"\n\n\nA: Medibuntu PPA has been shutdown, that's why synaptic failed to fetch the repository list from medibuntu.

So same question : Can I change the group owner of /var/www/html to www-data with write access ?\n\nA: Usually, it is a bad idea to give write access to the account running the Web Server (www-data under Ubuntu).\nFor your scenario, I would change the owner of /var/www/html to the ftpuser with a read-write for him, read only for the group and the others. Apache needs at least to be able to read in this directory.\nUPD: If you have more than one user to give access to, put them all in the same group, change the group ownership to this group and give the group read & write access too.\nSecurity-wise, it is a bad idea to give Apache write access to all files he can access. If someone is able to do \"nasty things\" with your web server, at least he won't be able to change the files using Apache directly.\nDon't forget to secure the installation of the FTP server you intend to use to let ftpuser upload files.\nIf Mediawiki needs to write on some files, I would give to these files only the read-write rights for the www-data user (by setting the owner of these files to www-data). If you cannot predict which files need to be writable by the web application, you'd better to isolate this application into a subfolder of ´/var/www/html´.\nBy experience, I know that when right access is needed on some of the file, usually the documentation of the application details exactly which ones.\n\nA: The Apache2 web server is available in Ubuntu Linux. To install Apache2:\nAt a terminal prompt enter the following command:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 \n\nBasic Settings\nIf you wish to configure a new virtual host or site, copy that file into the same directory with a name you choose. For example:\nsudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default /etc/apache2/sites-available/mynewsite\n\nEdit the new file to configure the new site using some of the directives described below. \n\nA: If you do not already have Apache installed, you can do so now by issuing the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nThis is all that is necessary to have a working web server. If you visit your VPS's IP \naddress in a web browser, you will get the default Apache index page:\nyour_domain_name_or_ip_address\n\nIt works!\nThis is the default web page for this server.\nThe web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.\n\nThe Apache File Hierarchy in Ubuntu and Debian\nOn Ubuntu and Debian, Apache keeps its main configuration files within the \"/etc/apache2\" folder:\ncd /etc/apache2\nls -F\n\napache2.conf  envvars     magic            mods-enabled/  sites-available/\nconf.d/       httpd.conf  mods-available/  ports.conf     sites-enabled/\n\nLooking at the Apache2.conf File\nThe main configuration details for your Apache server are held in the \"/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\" file.\nThis file is divided into three main sections: configuration for the global Apache server process, configuration for the default server, and configuration of Virtual Hosts.\nIn Ubuntu and Debian, the majority of the file is for global definitions, and the configuration of the default server and virtual hosts is handled at the end, by using the \"Include ...\" directive.\nThe \"Include\" directive allows Apache to read other configuration files into the current file at the location that the statement appears. The result is that Apache dynamically generates an overarching configuration file on startup.\nIf you scroll to the bottom of the file, there are a number of different \"Include\" statements. These load module definitions, the ports.conf document, the specific configuration files in the \"conf.d/\" directory, and finally, the Virtual Host definitions in the \"sites-enabled/\" directory.\nWe will focus on the first part of the file to learn how Apache defines its global settings.\nI hope it works for you\n", "Q: Display bug on resolution > 800 / ubuntu 14 on VMware I moved a VM to a laptop  (1366x768).

There is nothing wrong with that approach. Note, however, that this means ps will be extracting information for all running processes and then you have awk or grep filtering out the lines of interest.\nI would propose that it's slightly more efficient to use pgrep to get a list of PIDs (as you show in your question), and use ps to get the output format you want for only the PIDs matched by pgrep.\nSimple process match, POSIX-style full listing\npg() {\n    pids=`pgrep -d, \"$1\"`\n    [ \"$pids\" ] && ps -f -p \"$pids\"\n}\n\npg myprocess\n\nThis shows a full ps listing for the matched process names. This function definition can be added to ~/.bashrc to always be defined in your interactive shell. This can also be modified in a few different ways to change the output format or to match full command lines instead of just the process name.\nSimple process match, BSD-style user listing\npg() {\n    pids=`pgrep -d, \"$1\"`\n    [ \"$pids\" ] && ps up \"$pids\"\n}\n\nFull command-line match, BSD-style job control listing\npg() {\n    pids=`pgrep -f -d, \"$1\"`\n    [ \"$pids\" ] && ps jp \"$pids\"\n}\n\nFull command-line match, POSIX-style long listing\npg() {\n    pids=`pgrep -f -d, \"$1\"`\n    [ \"$pids\" ] && ps -l -p \"$pids\"\n}\n\nNote the -f option on pgrep in the last two examples to match on the full command line. You can alter these examples to suit your needs, the important part being that the p or -p option is given with the list of PIDs found by pgrep.\n", "Q: How do I deal with an error message installing Ubuntu from DVD on an old machine?

You probably need to replace your CMOS battery with a new one.

But the remap works globally and requires root permissions. Is it possible to remap a key locally and have it working with and without X?\n\nA: Well bummers!  I've done some research and discovered that changing the keymap to remap CAPSLOCK (for example) REQUIRES root access.  I'm sorry.\n\nIn the spirit of information, I'll retain what I had been working on here:\nYou can set up user-only keyboard configurations by putting options in ~/.keyboard, these will override the system-wide defaults set in /etc/default/keyboard\n\n\n*\n\n*NOTE: to get setupcon to read your ~/.keyboard, you MUST create ~/.console-setup, an empty file will suffice.  The logic in setupcon does not check for ~/.keyboard, it looks for ~/.console-setup and then reads both files.  Tsk Tsk\n\n\nYou didn't specify what you'd like CAPSLOCK to be mapped to, so I'll give several examples.\nYou can use the /etc/default/keyboard file as a template if you wish, something like one of these entries in ~/.keyboard would probably work well for you:\n(remember you really only need settings which override the system defaults in /etc/default/keyboard)\nXKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:nocaps\"     # CAPSLOCK => CTRL\n\nXKBOPTIONS=\"caps:escape\"     # CAPSLOCK => ESC\n\nXKBOPTIONS=\"compose:caps\"    # CAPSLOCK => Compose (my favorite!)\n\nThere are (many!) more options available, have a look at the man page for setupcon (1) and the contents of the file: /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst on your system.k\n", "Q: How do I safely run a graphical application as a normal user while root?

I need it to start a graphical application on a set user's desktop as that user.\nI don't want to bomb .Xauthority or any of that, so what's the safest way to accomplish this?\n\nA: sudo -i should work in reverse too but you need to state which user you want to run as:\nDISPLAY=:0 sudo -i -u oli zenity --info --text \"Oh hai!\"\n\n", "Q: Problem downloading files from Ubuntu One cloud I've followed the instructions, but I have this back in my terminal:\n./u1_downloader\nbash: ./u1_downloader: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You need to download the 32 bits version from here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/U1/Downloader/All/Architectures\nOr in terminal, just follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the file with wget \nwget 'http://ubuntuone.com/u1-downloader/u1-downloader-32b.tar.gz'\n\n*Next, run this command to uncompress the program: \ntar zxf u1-downloader.tar.gz\n\n*Go to the program's newly-created directory by running: \ncd u1-downloader\n\n*Start the program by running: \n./u1_downloader\nYou’ll be prompted for your credentials: enter your email and hit enter, then type in your password and hit enter.

I move my mouse and press my keyboard, but screen stays blank. My monitor goes into standby mode, if I turn it off and on again it says \"no input\".\nI suppose that pressing any keyboard key or moving the mouse doesn't wake it up because the keyboard is not working. The caps lock and num lock buttons don't light up when I press them (they usually do). Why is the keyboard turned off when screen is locked?\nIt's Ubuntu 14.04 on a DELL Optiplex GX620, the mouse is wireless (Logitech Unifying Receiver) and the keyboard is connected via USB. I tried connecting a different mouse or keyboard to a different port. The mouse's red laser at the bottom does light up, but the PC does not resume.\nI have used Debian Sid, Arch Linux and elementaryOS on this computer before Ubuntu, and this problem did not occur. Ubuntu is the only distro which locks the screen with LightLocker, so maybe the problem is with LightLocker...\nThe weird thing: This does not happen if I leave the PC alone and wait until it locks itself automatically! Only if I manually lock it.\nEdit: I can't access TTY1-6 either.\n\nA: I had similar issues with Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 more recently.\nAfter struggling for a while, I found that disabling USB auto suspend, solved (worked around) the problem.\nThis feature is a part of usbcore which is compiled in the kernel in Ubuntu.\nFrom https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/175035,\n\nEdit the /etc/default/grub file and change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line to add the usbcore.autosuspend=-1 option:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash usbcore.autosuspend=-1\"\n\nNote that quit splash were already present options.

Very simple question. When I am in my home directory in terminal and type pwd I get /home/<myusername>. And it is the same directory when I am in Nautilus Home section:\nUbuntu and Lubuntu file managers:\n \nSo why is the same directory but it's called different ways? It's sometimes confusing when going through the directories in terminal.\n\nA: The HOME environment variable stores the path of your /home/<username> directory.\n$ echo $HOME\n/home/avinash\n$ pwd\n/home/avinash\n\nSo when you are in /home/<username> directory(nautilus), its corresponding variable HOME is displayed.\n\nA: A user's Home folder is, conceptually, their own personal space within the filesystem. It's the place where they can do (almost) anything they want without having to worry about messing up the system in general. Ubuntu puts most people's home folders as /home/[username] by default, but they can go just about anywhere in the filesystem. They can even be changed, though that isn't just a matter of dragging the folder to another place: you'd need to dig fairly deep into the system configuration to do it.\nUbuntu, Lubuntu, and other systems sometimes have their own names for this folder within their user interfaces. This is because, unlike Mac OS X or Windows, there is no single team that works on \"the Linux GUI\". In fact, there's no single piece of software that can be called \"the Linux GUI\". There are many different distributions derived from Ubuntu, but for many of them, the choice of which GUI they use by default is the biggest difference between them.\nThere is no single team that works on all of these GUIs: each one has its own. There are some standards that the different GUIs use to interoperate with each other, but there is no unifying standard for naming things like the home folder, so different GUIs do it differently. That's what you're seeing here.\n\nA: The \"Home\" in nautilus is simply a link to /home/<username>. It is the same way that windows puts different names (.e.g. \"My Documents\", but it's \"Documents\" in terminal).\nIt is to make it more user friendly, they want your \"Home\" space to be obvious how to find. It is only more advanced users that find that it is different - so you don't get conflicts with other users. It's also easier when helping someone remotely, to say \"Click on home\"\nTypically, your home folder is /home/user but this is optional. A system administrator can put it anywhere, and nautilus's Home link will redirect to the new place, if it is set in /etc/passwd.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n\nA: It is called the user's Home directory, even when working from the Linux Command Line. All the directories under /home are called Home directories, they are grouped together for the sake of simplicity. Think of it this way: Just like /bin stores binaries, /home stores Home Directories.\nSo when Nautilus tells you the directory is \"Home\", it is literally \"Your Home Directory\", and therefore not a misnomer at all. It's the culture of Linux.\nAnother person pointed out that the $HOME environment variable is set to a user's Home Directory. The name for the variable has the same reason behind it as the name \"Home,\" namely it's the culture.\nWhy is it the culture?\nIn an ideal Linux instance, everything the user does, all custom configuration, all documents, files of any kind, will exist inside that folder. It belongs to the user, it's in the user's Home Directory. That means the user can keep to himself, and makes knowing where your stuff is a bit easier. The computer kernel, programs, boot controls, all the stuff needed to run the computer, can go everywhere except inside the user-generated space, their home directory. Linux doesn't install any programs inside the home directory (third party programs might do this anyway), and there is always a system-wide configuration that a user could override if they want. The override configuration would be, of course, in their home directory. If you went from one Linux computer to another, and all you brought with you was your home directory, if the other computer [was set up to see you as a user, and] had the same programs installed, it would be almost as if you were on your original computer.\n\nA: Using a generic label for the home folder is beneficial to any OS that offers customer support.\nIt's much easier to walk someone through clicking on \"Home\", than it is to walk someone through, \"Home folder... with your username... what's your username on the machine?... that's your full name that displays for the login manager, but you should have a username without any spaces in it... OK, just read me all the folders you see...\"\n\nA: Different label, same core concept. Home folder of user is /home/ and reference by environment variable: HOME. In general, there is a config file to setup it.\n", "Q: How to mass add file extension? My photo importer moved files from my camera and renamed them, but I forgot to specify that it should keep the file extension. So I have several folders with hundreds of JPG & AVI files that are all missing their proper extension.\nThere aren't that many video files so I can manually rename them either before of after a general mass-rename to JPG.\nTo make things more complicated, the filenames contain spaces, so I can't just mv \"*\" \"*.jpg\" because, well, that doesn't work (but that's what I'd do, coming from DOS/Windows).\nI know Linux is full of powerful commands. How can I mass-rename files to add a .jpg extension, when those files contain spaces?\nPlease don't say \"don't use spaces\" because that's really not what I'm asking about. Thanks.\n\nA: If you have a more complex hierarchy, you'll need a slightly more sophisticated approach. You can either use bash's globstar option which lets ** match  zero or more directories and subdirectories or you can use find.\n\n\n*\n\n*globstar\nshopt -s globstar\nfor f in **/*; do [ -f \"$f\" ] && mv \"$f\" \"$f\".jpg; done\n\nThe [ -f \"$f\" ] & ensures that the mv command is only run on files and not directories.\n\n*find\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} mv \"{}\" \"{}\".jpg\n\nThe -type f ensures we only find files and no directories and the print0 causes find to print its output separated with the null character (\\0) instead of newlines. This ensures that we deal correctly with file names containing spaces or newlines or other weirdness. \nxargs takes a list of input and runs the command given on it. The -0 flag tells it to expect null-separated input and the -I{} will make it replace each instance of {} with each of the input records (files in this case) passed.\n\nA: Please refer to man rename before you try this\nThis should work like a charm.\nIn a terminal: \ncd /path/to/exported/imgs/folder/\nrename  's/(\\w+)$/$1\\.jpg/' *\n\nPlease change \"jpg\" to whatever you need.\nrename can use perl expresions.. your best friend\nAt first line you entered your files directory\ncd /path/to/exported/imgs/folder/\n\nThe s the before expresion indicates a substitution\nrename  's/(\\w+)$/$1\\.jpg/' *\nThen will search for any file with an alphanumeric and underscore name , but without extension\nrename  's/(\\w+)$/$1\\.jpg/' *\nAnd replace add to it . a dot jpg\nrename  's/(\\w+)$/$1\\.jpg/' *\nFinally apply to any file in first line folder\nrename  's/(\\w+)$/$1\\.jpg/' *\n\nA: I would advise you use a program called pyrenamer.\nOpen it, and in the Renamed file name pattern, enter {1}.jpg.\n\nA: I encounter this situation quite often administering systems, especially when dealing with filenames created by windows applications.  To add .jpg extensions on filenames without any extension, consider this command list.\nfind ./example -type f -name '*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I'{}' mv '{}' '{}'.jpg\n\nfind's -print0 generates NULL characters for separators, xargs's -0 is for accepting those NULL separators.  This will also do this for any subdirectories, so be sure to  replace that './example'  path.\nrename is a great command, but it's distro specific in both implementation and specification.  I generally use things like rename on the command line, but I always write in GNU utils standards for my scripts. \n\nA: Shell globs should work even with spaces in the names if used properly e.g.\nrename -nv -- 's/$/.jpg/' *\n\nor\nfor file in *; do echo mv -- \"$file\" \"$file.jpg\"; done\n\n[NOTE: these are 'no ops' until the n switch or the echo are removed - so you can check the correct replacement before committing]\nIf you do want to automatically distinguish between jpg and avi files that would also be possible using a more complex loop and the file or mimetype command\n\nA: Use this command:\nrename  's/$/.jpg/' *\n\n", "Q: Grub Do not Load Dual Boot after ShutDown I have Dual Boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10 .\nWhen I shut down/restart the Ubuntu I get the the start screen but GRUB wont load .

You will need to either ask the Docker Engine Developers to write an apparmor profile for you or write your own. Same with a selinux profile.\nNow here is where you will start to get options, should you use or not use LXC, apparmor, selinux, etc.\nFor example, the Docker developers feel you need to update - http://blog.docker.com/ and that is certainly one way to manage the situation.\nApparmor and selinux protect you (potentially) from zero day  exploits, but exploits are fixed via updates. \nThe advantage of apparmor is that it is easier to learn. The disadvantage is that you have to write you own profile. \nSee the apparmor documentation\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor#Profile_customization\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor\nor, for a practical example, using a rather simple program, see http://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/apparmor-privoxy-profile/\nAs long as we are on opinions ...\nRHEL and Fedora are a bit ahead of the curve compared to Ubuntu in terms of Virtualization.  RHEL is working with Docker to provide support, including selinux\nhttp://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/4/red-hat-docker-expand-collaboration\nI am not sure about Fedora and Docker, but Fedora uses selinux and virtmanager to manage LXC - http://major.io/2014/04/21/launch-secure-lxc-containers-on-fedora-20-using-selinux-and-svirt/\nAt the end of the day, you will have to review the opinions and go with the solution that works best for you.\n\nA: Current version of docker-engine is 1.10.2-cs1, and here is the default AppArmor Profile for running containers that Docker provides at https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/\n#include <tunables/global>\n\n\nprofile docker-default flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {\n\n  #include <abstractions/base>\n\n\n  network,\n  capability,\n  file,\n  umount,\n\n  deny @{PROC}/{*,**^[0-9*],sys/kernel/shm*} wkx,\n  deny @{PROC}/sysrq-trigger rwklx,\n  deny @{PROC}/mem rwklx,\n  deny @{PROC}/kmem rwklx,\n  deny @{PROC}/kcore rwklx,\n\n  deny mount,\n\n  deny /sys/[^f]*/** wklx,\n  deny /sys/f[^s]*/** wklx,\n  deny /sys/fs/[^c]*/** wklx,\n  deny /sys/fs/c[^g]*/** wklx,\n  deny /sys/fs/cg[^r]*/** wklx,\n  deny /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/** rwklx,\n  deny /sys/kernel/security/** rwklx,\n}\n\nTo load a new profile into AppArmor:\n$ apparmor_parser -r -W /path/to/your_profile\nWhen you run a container, it uses the docker-default policy unless you override it with the security-opt option.

It got a ssd along with 1T disk. I'm not sure, but when I leave some space from C disk to install ubuntu (doesn't matter if its formatted or only free space), the ubuntu installer from bootable usb won't show this free space only the ssd. Anyone know why? \n2) I got a external 1T disk that i use for backup. If I install ubuntu on this disk and uses it booting ubuntu from usb whenever I need it, does it uses all my available hardware? Because that seems a good solution. Will I be able to access my windows files from that bootable ubuntu usb stick?\nThanks\n\nA: Installing on the external disk will be just like installing on an internal disk. There should be no limitations on what hardware it can use. The only difference will be in speed. Depending on how the external disk is connected, it will not be as fast at booting or loading files as an internal disk. Connections like eSATA or USB 3.0 could be closer to the performance of internal disks.\nYou will only need to plug in the external drive when you want to boot Ubuntu or access it from Windows. Windows will not need the drive to boot, and even if you set up the BIOS to boot the external drive first, and the external drive is not attached, it should move on to the internal drive.\n\nA: solution to 1\nThe intel SRT used raid files to do something since the computer has both a hard drive and a flash ssd.

At the login menu, it would show a few options:\n    System Default\n    GNOME\n    GNOME Classic\n    GNOME Flashback (metacity)\n    GNOME Flashback (compiz)\n\nI would select GNOME Classic to login. It would show an interface like the following post: http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2013/07/08/gnome-3-classic-is-more-of-a-hybrid-desktop/\nThe main features were the Applications / Places menu. When you would hit the super button it would bring up the dash (as well as moving the mouse to the upper right hand corner).

I have the GNOME Flashback metacity/compiz, but I do not have the GNOME Classic. I was really happy with this hybrid interface. Does anyone know how I can bring it back?\n\nA: After googling much, I found that the panels at the top and bottom of the classic view are called gnome-panel. You can run gnome-panel to have them show up. Do Super(aka Start)-Alt-Right-click on them to add, remove panels, or to change properties. The same to add a feature to any given panel, The missing feature you are describing is probably the \"Menu bar\" item you can add. The task pane is called \"Window list\" - or you can choose \"Window panel\"\nAnother great component to add would be \"Indicator applet complete\"\nIt is nearly impossible to figure out how to remove or move what you've added. So here it is: Super(aka Start)-Alt-Right-click on a particular feature you've added, and you'll see a Move/Remove menu. Choose Move and then you can grab that item and move around.\nAnother useful tip I learned is that in any of those desktops you can run (Alt-F2) unity to add unity or gnome-panel to add that panel. So you can sort of combine things.

So, I tried formatting the Ubuntu OS partition into an unknown file type for it, so it would just go past the grub screen, and allow to me install this OS. However, once I did this and rebooted, this is what I found:\nerror: unknown filesystem.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrubrescue>\nNow, before anyone says anything, I don't have a Windows repair disc, because my computer came with Windows on it. 2nd, I don't have a Ubuntu Live CD.

Hope somebody can help me. :)\n\nA: Well fix is simple find the find bootable linux medium and install it on your computer. There is way to boot the computer via grub rescue but for that you need an Operating System but you just formatted it.\nIf you were doing a dual boot(ie Windows and Ubuntu) here's what you can do. Boot you computer let it come till grub rescue. Now windows is usually on the first partition so type\nset root=(hd0,msdos1)\nchainloader +1\nboot \nif its on the secondary drive, then\nset root=(hd1,msdos1)\ndrivemap -s hd0 hd1\nchainloader +1\nboot\nnow if you are able to boot windows, open run WindowsKey + R\ntype msconfig move to the boot tab.\nselect windows boot loader and press Set as default. \nit guess this should fix.\n", "Q: Don't understand following error: 'mkdir: invalid option -- '/' I'm following a tutorial in a book and I'm tryin to install Oracle JDK 8.\nI've opened a terminal and entered the following command after the dollar prompt:\nsudo mkdir -p/usr/lib/jvm/\n\nHowever, it's throwing me the following error: \n\nmkdir: invalid option -- '/'\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: There needs to be a SPACE after the -p, so..\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm/\n\n\nA: You should write with a space after the option e before the directory name  \nsudo mkdir -p    /usr/lib/jvm/\n\n\nSome words about the options and the use of the space.\nIn general the use of the space after the option depends from the command and the option that you intend to use. Each time you have to read the synopsis of the command. In this case you can use man mkdir.  \nSYNOPSIS  \n     mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...  \n\nDESCRIPTION\n...\n       -m, --mode=MODE  \n             set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask  \n       -p, --parents\n             no error if existing, make parent directories as needed\n\n...\n\nIf the option is written with a space you have to use the space between option and option_argument. If it is not present you have not to use it. You can see the standard links below for the complete list of rules and exceptions. \nMoreover in the same command you can have two or more different way to call the same action.\nSo for another option with the same command you can do \nmkdir A  -m a+x\nmkdir A --mode=a+x\n\nThose command are equivalent and produce the same effect, but in the first case you need the space and the second not.\nNote:  \n\n\n*\n\n*the option -p or --parents do not requires argument and have to be separated however from the Name(s) of the directory that you want to create.\n\n\nReferences:\nIf interested you may read more from those standards IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 12.1.2 and GNU Getopt.\n", "Q: Swap not availlable I have noticed that my swap is not available. This could explain why my computer freezes every so often when I am using it heavily.\nI installed 14.04 64-bit with an encrypted folder, which automatically encrypts my swap.

Is this even possible on an encrypted swap? Finally, how do I fix /etc/crypttab?\n\nA: Thanks to your comments, @saiarcot895, on further investigation I have discovered what to do.\nI have edited /etc/crypttab to remove the extra line (there was also an extra line in /etc/fstab, which I removed), and to replace UUID with the partition reference. Hence:\ncryptswap1 /dev/sda6 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\n\nI would still like to know how to replace the partition reference with the UUID, but perhaps that's not possible with an encrypted swap.\nEDIT:\nAs far as I can tell, the UUID of an encrypted partition is unavailable until that partition has been decrypted. I have discovered that in the case of an encrypted swap using a random key each boot, the UUID changes each time. Therefore, the UUID is not useful in specifying which encrypted partition to mount.\nThis can cause a serious problem with removable disks!\n\nA: run cfdisk re-create the swap partition.\nrun command\n# mkswap /dev/sda6\nthen\n# swapon /dev/sda6\nmind that sda6 is your swap partition\n", "Q: How can I add a new drive to an existent logical volume?

I've also tried the solutions listed here: Installing PHP 5.3 in Ubuntu 14.04\nI'm running a LAMP setup on 14.04.\nIs there any way or would I be better off using a different version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: You could go with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid. Security support runs out for that in less than a year, but that should give you enough time to patch your PHP.\nIn my opinion using an Ubuntu-supported package is preferable to compiling from source, and 10.04 does happen to have the version you want as its official package.\nEventually you are going to have to patch your PHP code, however. It shouldn't be that difficult to bring it into compatibility with later PHP versions: all issues will be well documented online, and there will only be a small number of issues that would affect backward compatibility.  Older versions of PHP won't be supported forever and eventually you'll end up with security problems if you stick with PHP versions that are not officially supported.\n\nA: I think you'd uninstall PHP and then get the 5.3 source file and compile it by extracting the .tar, going into that directory, and running \"make install clean\"\n", "Q: Can I play Windows games through virtual desktop?

They're about as different as two Debian derivatives can possibly be.\n\n\n*\n\n*Different graphics (X vs Mir)\n\n*Different UI (Mer vs Unity 8)\n\n*Different application tookits (Largely GTK+ IIRC vs QT5 and HTML5)\n\n*Different packaging (Debs vs Deb for the base system and Click for the user-installed)\n\n\nSimply put they're wildly different things.\nI wouldn't immediately say it's impossible to run one's applications on the other but I wouldn't know where to start.\n\n\n*\n\n*Maemo applications are largely just standard Linux applications (compiled for the n900's processor).

If it is possible how would i do this? \n\nA: In short, you don't want to. SATA maxes at about 2 GB/s read/write speed. Whereas, DDR3 RAM has about 16-24 GB/s transfer rate.\nSo basically, you're going to be running about 10 times slower - and that's if you have the highest speed hard drives out there (you might, but probability sides with that you don't). Also, that's not how RAM/swap works. Swap is for things that are INACTIVE.

Thanks in advance. \n\nA: On unix file system, file and directory have two part: inode and data.\nIn inodes are stored information about file such as permission, owner, change time, access time, and so on. \nThe total number of inodes is limited, so you can get No space left on device if you reach such limit even if the disk is not very full.\nUse:\ndf -i\n\nto view inodes, if you get 100% for IUse and 0 IFree, this means that you have a lot of small file.\nFor example if you have 2 billions files whose size is 1 byte, you could reach inode limit, but your disk could be not completely full.\nIf this is your case, try to remove more file you can and than redo apt-get update.\n\nA: You can clean up space in /boot (remove old linux headers etc), with: \nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: I also encountered this problem. According to the prompt,\n\nunable to create\n  /usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-29-generic/include/...\n\nAs explained by Lety, \"The total number of inodes is limited\". So I deleted some old linux-headers packages using the package manager so /usr will have enough inodes, for example sudo apt-get remove linux-headers-3.13.0-3*, then I can run sudo apt-get install -f to continue the installation.\n\nA: As @Lety said, the problem is how to find folders with a lot of tiny files which wasted all your inodes (as df -i show).\nFind heavy packages (like old kernels) with\nwajig sizes | tail -n 30\n\nwhich requiere wajig installed, otherwise:\ndpkg-query --show --showformat='${Package;-50}\\t${Installed-Size}\\n' | sort -k 2 -n | grep -v deinstall | awk '{printf \"%.3f MB \\t %s\\n\", $2/(1024), $1}'|tail -n 10\n\nUse uname -r to find current kernel, you don't want to remove it.\nThen try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot or try if there is any process to kill which opened a large file which has since been deleted sudo lsof +L1\n\n*Remove unused packages sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n*Clean cache sudo apt-get clean or manually on /var/cache/apt/archives\n\n*Use apt-get remove or sudo dpkg --purge to remove some old kernels or heavy packages.\nMaybe you still get unable to create /usr/src/linux-headers...\n\n*If you get here you will use those slow techniques to find the guilty folder, but first go to the usual suspects using something like for i in /usr/src/*; do echo $i; find $i |wc -l; done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux header folders: /usr/src/linux-headers-*\n\n*Logs: /var/log/\nSpecific folder counters:\n\n\n*\n\n*du --inodes -d 1 /usr/src/ | sort -n\n\n*sudo find . -xdev -type f | cut -d \"/\" -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n\n\n*sudo find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | grep -v '^\\.$' | xargs -n 1 -i{} find {} -xdev -type f | cut -d \"/\" -f 2 | uniq -c | sort -n\n\nA: Your tmpfs may be full. /tmp lives in your RAM or swap. You can check how much space is being used by running:\n$ df -h | grep tmpfs\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\ntmpfs           3.9G   33M  3.9G   1% /dev/shm\ntmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs           3.9G  3.9G     0 100% /tmp\n\nTo temporarily increase its size, try the following command:\nsudo mount -o remount,size=16G,noatime /tmp\n\nYou can also permanently increase the size through /etc/fstab.\n\nA: I had the problem that there was no space and no inodes on my /boot partition left. I tried to remove old kernels via dpkg but it was not doing the trick. After inspecting the folder with du -h and ls -h I found that most space was used by initramfs files.\nTo uninstall them I had to follow this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels\n\n*\n\n*First I checked which kernel version I was using via uname -r\n\n*Then I found other installed kernel versions via dpkg -l | grep linux-image | grep ii (the grep ii ensures that only installed versions are listed)\n\n*I choose the oldest kernels and used the command sudo update-initramfs -d -k 4.2.0-15-generic. I don't know if that is strictly neccessary.\n\n*Then I purged the kernel with dpkg --purge 4.2.0-15-generic\n\n*Now I was finally able to run apt -f install\n\n*and sudo apt autoremove\n\nA: Running out of inodes on Ubuntu: if below commands showing the same error go to /usr/src and delete old kernel(unused) directories so it will resolve the issues.\nsudo apt-get -f install\nsudo apt autoremove\n\nFor more information, see: https://medium.com/@brucepomeroy/running-out-of-inodes-on-ubuntu-718aef71ac16\n", "Q: \"package libmono-security4.0-cil is not ready for configuration\" how to make it ready?

My idea is to fully encrypt Ubuntu (inside VM) and all data inside Ubuntu. Is this procedure (encryption of the whole system inside the VM) are all possible? Should I use TrueCrypt (this probably is not possible), or should I encrypt with confidence from within Ubuntu 14.04? What are the steps to encrypt from within Ubuntu? Any advice will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can encrypt your complete installation (beside the kernel which needs to be unencrypted for bootup) during installation process of Ubuntu. Just install another virtual machine and check for that option. It's a little hidden at the disc partition section -- at least it was on 13.x installers. \nTo encrypt it after installation is possible, but a real pain in the ass for non experienced users. \nTrueCrypt as you know from Windows is not working (and TrueCrypt 7.2 is not able to encrypt at all anymore)\n", "Q: openssh server is refusing connections by blocking or resetting On a quite fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 (machine1), I have openssh-server with a completely default config.\nWhen connecting from machine2 on the LAN, with an empty ~/.ssh, I get the following debug output from the server (running as /usr/sbin/sshd -p 22 -D -d -e): http://pastebin.com/WeHGzsUM and the relevant bits are probably:\ndebug1: permanently_set_uid: 118/65534 [preauth]\ndebug1: list_hostkey_types: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ssh-ed25519 [preauth]\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent [preauth]\nRead from socket failed: Connection reset by peer [preauth]\ndebug1: do_cleanup [preauth]\n...\n\nWhen connecting from machine2 with my normal ~/.ssh that works on many servers, I get the following debug output on machine1: http://pastebin.com/uxKfAYSL\nIn both cases, on machine2, the client reports: http://pastebin.com/dTp4mNne which looks normal to me until the last line:\nssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer\n\nOn server and client, ssh client is version:\nOpenSSH_6.6p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\n\nAnd the server has version:\nOpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014\n\nThe exact same client command that fails remotely works perfectly on the server, machine1, so it's not an account problem.\nEarlier, before I upgraded my ssh client on machine2, ssh would block indefinitely, after showing this debug output http://pastebin.com/JSX6r7Yp and on the server I'd see the following in auth.log\nJun 19 22:27:47 lemur sshd[6491]: Did not receive identification string from 192.168.1.12\n\nUPDATE:\nTurns out (thanks to @chaos) this had nothing to do with ssh.

What is the command line to show the list of all installed extensions on the firefox browser? Is there any. I checked man firefox but did not help.\n\nA: This is basically just a simplified version of @chaos's approach:\ngrep -oP '},\"name\":\"\\K[^\"]*' ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/addons.json\n\nThere's no reason to get the name of the user, you can always just use ~/ or $HOME to get the home directory. The name of the default profile is, likewise, unneeded. You probably only have one and its name will be RandomString.default. If you have more than one, and different addons for each, this approach will list all of them. So, if you do have multiple profiles, you might want to add | uniq to the above command to remove duplicates. \nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*grep -oP : the -o causes grep to only print the matched portion of the line and the -P activates Perl Compatible Regular Expressions which are needed for the \\K (see below).\n\n*},\"name\":\"\\K[^\"]*: match the longest stretch of non-\" characters ([^\"]*) that come right after },\"name\":. The \\K means \"ignore everything matched up to here\" which, when combined with -o, will cause only the part of the match after the name:\":\" to be printed.\n\n*~/ : this is your home directory.\n\n\nA: Give a try to this grep oneliner command to list all the firefox addons,\ngrep -oP '(?<=\\},\\\"name\\\":\\\")([^\"]*)' ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/addons.json\n\nOR\nThis worked for me:\nuser@host:~$ cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/addons.json |\npython -c 'import json,sys;obj=json.load(sys.stdin);\nfor (i, x) in enumerate(obj[\"addons\"]):\n  print x[\"name\"]' | uniq\n\nOutput in my case:\nClean Links\nTee-Timer\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/addons.json: reads the addons.json file in each profile.\n\n*python -c 'import json,sys;obj=json.load(sys.stdin); load the json parser library of python and loads json via stdin (standard input), ergo from cat\n\n*for (i, x) in enumerate(obj[\"addons\"]): phyton code to loop through the array of addons...\n\n*print x[\"name\"]' | uniq ...and print its name only one.\n\n\nA: Following scriptlet is just a more-featureful version of @chaos's code.

I already have Windows 7 on an SSD set to AHCI and it is in legacy mode. I am trying to install Ubuntu onto a hard drive, but have run into some problems. The first time I installed Ubuntu it wouldn't connect to a wired network, and it only ran in low graphics mode.\nI wiped and reformatted the said hard drive after that and went for a second attempt, with no success. I have wiped the drive again and started over, except this time I decided to try Ubuntu instead of installing and from a live CD it immediately entered into low graphics mode. I did some research and found that my motherboard might be a problem.\nSpecs:\n\n*\n\n*CPU: AMD FX-6300, 6-Core, 3.5 GHz\n\n*mobo: Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 rev. 4.0 (Realtek GbE LAN chip)\n\n*GPU: Sapphire Radeon R7-260X 2GB\n\n*RAM: PNY XLR8 DDR3-1600 (8GB)\n\n*SSD: Kingston SSDNow V300 60GB (Windows 7 installed)\n\n*HDD: Western Digital Caviar Blue 500GB (future Ubuntu home)\n\n*HDD: Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB (applications and stuff)\n\nTo the best of my knowledge the R7-260X graphics card and Linux should be able to work nicely together, yet whether I try or install Ubuntu I'm in low graphics mode. Is the motherboard hindering the entire process here? Is there a piece of the hardware that is preventing the kernel from seeing and recognizing the graphics card and network chip?\nThe closest answer I have found to this problem was Trouble Installing 12.10 on a GA-990FXA-UD3 Base Machine: Network and USB Don't Work.\nI have tried setting the network stack to enable along with the iommu before the installation to see if that would work when just trying Ubuntu from the live CD, but that did not work.\nDo I have to do a full install first, then change the motherboard options, or will I have to install Ubuntu, download the Realtek drivers from their website, and install via USB? Will I have to do the same thing for my graphics card?\nI would like to eventually migrate to Linux full time or at least most of the time.  I have messed around with Ubuntu on my old (8 years old) HP laptop, but if my hardware and software don't aren't compatible I don't know if that will be an option. I don't want to only use Ubuntu on outdated hardware with no real upgrade options. As I am new to the world of Linux, please be as direct and precise as possible about how to go about addressing these issues with my current hardware.\n\nA: Here are some ways I have successfully booted the Ubuntu installation media on a computer with a similar motherboard.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit minimal CD written to a USB flash drive, following the instructions here.\n\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 install from the Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit desktop iso file written to a USB flash drive, following the instructions here. The key to the success of this method was using the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator application which is built-in in Ubuntu and also included in the Ubuntu live DVD. I tried using UNetbootin and also burning a DVD, and both of them didn't work. I strongly recommend that you either reformat the USB flash drive as FAT32 first with a partition editor like GParted to get rid of any existing bootloader garbage that you have already written to the USB flash drive or else use a new USB flash drive.\nThe same computer could not boot from the Ubuntu 13.10 Desktop iso file written to a USB flash drive.\nRegarding the BIOS settings for the SSD, I used AHCI but not Legacy mode.\nIf you get a black screen or low-graphics mode message after you finish the installation and reboot, that probably means that you need to enter a text-only virtual console by pressing the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + F3, login at the login: prompt with your username, login at the password: prompt with your user password, and install the fglrx proprietary driver for your Sapphire Radeon R7-260X graphics card with sudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle && sudo reboot.\n\nA: I have the 990FX and I've noticed that it's just generally finicky. I took too long to respond to this after \"fixing\" it, so I forgot all I did, but when you change settings, it likes to pretend you didn't do anything. I find that it's kind of like just restarting your computer; write down the settings you want, reset BIOS settings to default in the menu you're using. (I didn't clear CMOS/move jumper. I pressed the default button in the BIOS software), and then boot Ubuntu w/ default settings. Now, restart into the BIOS settings and fix them to your preference, and boot Ubuntu again. This has worked at least once for me. If I have any updates hopefully I'll update this. (no promises)\n\nA: another solution which could may be help...\nI got a GA-990FXA-UD5 Gigabyte motherboard. It was impossible to install Fedora or Debian as the screen turned black during the installation boot.

I have an Ubuntu server that is hosting my web application.\nBut due to some security reasons it is not visible through Internet. The customer needs to update the database and update some values in it, but due to same security reasons I am not allowed there any more so they asked me to create an executable file (like batch files in windows) that will update the database, hand it to the authorities and explain it to them so they can update the database.\nSay I have a database named myDb with a user say myUser and myPassword, and I need to execute this query:\nUPDATE myDb.member SET member_creditDueDate='2025-09-21 12:00:00';\n\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Making a command script\nIf the script you have to create is just to be executed as-is by people having access to the server and if the data to be put into the DB are delivered to you (so nothing dynamic), you would have to make a bash script like this :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ \"x$1\" == \"x\" ]; then\n   echo \"Usage: $0 <SQL commands file>\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n\nif [ ! -f \"$1\" ]; then\n   echo \"The file specified in parameter ($1) does not exist or is not readable\"\n   exit 2\nfi\n\nUSER=myUser\nPASS=myPassword\nDB=myDB\nSERVER=ipMysql\n\nmysql -u$USER -p$PASS -h$ipMysql $DB < $1    \n\nCopy all the above in one test file that you can call dataUpload.sh and then make it executable : sudo chmod +x dataUpload.sh.\nWhat does this script do?\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that you give a mandatory parameter : the path to a text file containing SQL command to update data in the DB (see below)\n\n*Check that the file given in parameter is accessible by the script\n\n*Set some variable with the credential to connect to the DB (attention that this is a quick approach here not taking some security aspect into consideration : for instance the password will be visible in clear text in the script and in the process list - ps -ef or ps auxwww when the script will run. You may look for a more secure approach)\n\n*Load the SQL commands of the SQL file into the DB using the command line mysql client.\n\n\nA SQL command file\nThis SQL command file is just a text file containing all the SQL command to INSERT or UPDATE data you would have done yourself if you could access the server.

I've dual booted Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Windows 8.1 on my Surface Pro. Only just installing it yesterday, being the noob that I am, it took me awhile to get it looking the way I wanted.\nWhile still trying to edit things around today, under the terminal I tried to press \"~\" on the onboard keyboard for file directory stuff. That's when the onboard keyboard decided not to work anymore. The keyboard itself pops up and you can see the keys being pressed but it doesn't actually type anything.\nI've tried googling my issue but it seems that no one else is suffering the exact same problem. I have no problems with using a mouse (or using the touch screen), it's just the onboard keyboard that's giving me issues...\nSo my question is, does anyone have a solution for my problem? I'd like to keep using Ubuntu but not being able to type whatsoever makes the OS almost useless.\nEDIT: Tested an USB wireless keyboard on my brother's system (exactly the same as mine) and it works not a problem but on mine, nothing is outputted.\nEDIT EDIT: Typing works perfectly under guest but not my account...\n\nA: The issue was that slow keys was on. \nTurning them off under System Settings > Universal Access > Typing fixed the whole keyboard issue.\n\nA: WARNING: This will reset most settings you made in System-Settings\nNOTE: Personal data won't be touched, but I do not guarantee anything.\nAs typing works perfectly when you log in as guest it is likely that some configuration files (in your home directory) got messed up (which is strange). You could try to delete/rename the configuration files in your home directory; you will need a USB keyboard.\nAs your keyboard doesn't work when you are logged in, log out. Then press the keys ctrl+alt+F1. You will be presented a command-line login-prompt. Log in using your username and your password (note: there are no dots or stars or something for every key you press when you enter your password).\nThen enter the following commands:\nmv .config .config_old\nmv .cache .cache_old\nmv .gconf .gconf.old\n\nThese commands rename all configuration files. (e.g. .config becomes .config_old)\nNow you can switch back to the GUI by pressing ctrl+alt+F7.\nThen log in as you would do normally.

You have to configure NAT in your firewall. This might look something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Source: WAN IP of A\n\n*Source Port: any \n\n*Destination: WAN IP of B\n\n*Destination Port: 22\n\n*Redirect to: LAN IP of B\n\n\nYou need to do this on both sides.\nI hope that this is what you meant.\n\nA: The proper way to do this would be to let the firewall do NAT (Network Address Translation) that maps the nodes behind it to different IP addresses. However, that may not be possible if you have only one IP address on the Internet side, but multiple nodes behind the firewall. In that case, the firewall could offer Port Address Translation. That means that packages sent to the firewall on port 22 are forwarded to port 22 on node \"r\", packages sent to port 23 are forwarded to port 22 on node \"s\", and so on.\n\nA: You can set up an IPSec or OpenVPN tunnel on both firewalls. That way, you can ignore the internet and treat both networks as being on the same LAN.\nThere are many tutorials on both technologies on how to set them up. Google is your friend or open a new thread in this forum.\nOnce the VPN tunnel has been set up, you can still use your firewall to secure the link.\n", "Q: how do I downgrade google chrome?

But the client was not acquiring the route from DHCP. Do we have to give route manually for IPV6. IPV4 acquires route from DHCP, is that the same with IPV6.\n\nA: IPv6 auto-configuration has several parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Routing is done with RA (Router Advertisement) messages sent out by the router(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*The RA message may tell the client that stateless auto-configuration is allowed so the client can give itself IPv6 addresses without needing to contact a DHCPv6 server\n\n*The RA message also informs the clients about if any DHCPv6 servers are present, and of which type.\n\n*The RA can also contain an indication that the router that sent it can be used as a default gateway.\n\n*(and there are many more things that can be in an RA, but let's keep it simple for now ;)\n\n\n*DHCPv6 can be used in two different modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can have a DHCPv6 server that does not hand out IPv6 addresses, but that does give extra information like DNS settings, time servers etc. This is called stateless DHCPv6.\n\n*You can have a 'full' DHCPv6 server that will give out addresses and any other settings. This is called stateful DHCPv6.\n\n\n\nDo the routing part is always done by the RA. DHCPv6 does not contain any routing information. The idea behind this is that the router knows better about routing than a DHCPv6 server.\nI would recommend starting with one of these scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't really care which addresses each device gets and just want them to be able to access the IPv6 internet: Let the router send out RA messages that indicate that a stateless DHCPv6 server is available and that stateless auto-configuration is allowed. Configure a stateless DHCPv6 server that provides DNS settings to the clients. The clients will then configure their own addresses based on the information in the RA, use the router as default gateway and they will get their DNS settings from the stateless DHCPv6 server.\n\n*If you do care about the addresses and want to manage them, when you want to update a DNS server automatically with a client's address etc.: Let the router send out RA messages that\nindicate that a stateful DHCPv6 server is available and that stateless auto-configuration is not allowed. Configure a full DHCPv6 server that hands out addresses and provides DNS settings to clients. The client will not configure its own addresses, will use the router as default gateway, and will get both addresses and DNS settings from the DHCPv6 server.\n\n", "Q: rsnapshot bug with 14.04 - rsync not found error Using rsnapshot with the +rsync_long_args=--rsync-path=\"sudo rsync\" command fails with a rsync not found error.

The only thing I still couldn't figure out is how to properly configure my kensington trackball.\nI have read all the pre-existing answers, but I still can't figure it out, so I apologize if this has been answered before.\nUnder Windows, I was used to having the TrackballWorks app, which lets me easily configure button mappings and such.\nUnder linux, I read online that I shall edit the xorg.conf file, but nowhere di I find a detailed manual page / specific tutorial.\nCould someone kindly enlighten me?\n\nA: xorg.conf files tend to be a pain. You can go ahead and edit it if you want, but, personally, I would not. \nThere's a commandline tool called xbindkeys. It allows you to route specific button presses to commands. There's a full explanation here, but I will try to explain it briefly here.\nFirstly, if you want to bind the keys to actions, you need to set up keyboard shortcuts for them (Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts). You do not need to do this to launch programs.\nYou'll need to install xbindkeys and xautomation.\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xautomation\n\nThen, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the xev command. It should pop up a small little window with a white box and a black background. Try not to move the mouse (it will make things hard to find), and click the button you want to set up. Then, go back to the terminal and find the last ButtonPress and/or ButtonRelease events (either one). The event will give you a number for the button you pressed (button <number>, towards the end). Remember that number.\nNow, in a new terminal instance, do nano ~/.xbindkeysrc. This will create a text file by which you can configure xbindkeys.\nFor that key, create an entry like so:\n\"command\"\n b: <button number>\n\nFor example, say you wanted to open Firefox when you pressed the mouse's \"home\" button (for me, button 10):\n# Run Firefox when \"home\" pressed\n\"firefox\"\n b: 10\n\nOr, if you wanted to bind it to a desktop action (like minimize all windows, like shown below), you would tell it to simulate the keybinding with xte:\n# Minimize all windows on \"2\" button press\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown Alt_L' 'key D' 'keyup Alt_L' 'keyup Control_L'\"\n  b: 11\n\nYou would repeat this process for the other buttons.\nWhen you're done, save the file (Ctrl+O and Enter), and close nano (Ctrl+X).\nThen, just launch xbindkeys outside the terminal (Alt+F2, then type xbindkeys).\nHowever, you will want it to autolaunch after every shutdown. Add it to your autostart configuration (Settings > Session > Startup > Application Autostart, add xbindkeys).\n", "Q: Fontconfig warning: \"/etc/fonts/conf.d/90-fonts-unfonts-core.conf\" I am getting the following error frequently.

Whenever I transfer large files, or large amounts of files, over USB to or from an external drive, the whole computer slows down to a crawl during the transfer. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, but I've had this problem before in earlier versions. Why does this happen? I want to be able to file a bug report to stop this from happening.\nCheers,\nReid\n\nA: This sounds like a classic case of system load to me.\nWhen you read/write something to/from a drive, it needs to lookup file information. However, that file may be fragmented, in different locations, or even organized.\nWhen you copy something from your drive to a USB, you have to read a (potentially) fragmented file and then re-write it to another storage medium. With some systems (read EXT), it is often faster than other systems (cough NTFS cough). Also, if you have a bad processor, it wastes cycles for other things trying to copy things over.\nThere is really nothing you can do to solve this issue. There are workarounds, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*Defragment your hard drive.\n\n*Use an EXT formatted flash drive where possible.\n\n*Install more memory as a \"cache\" space.\n\n*\n\n*Use excess memory as a ramdisc.\n\n\n*Use a better USB protocol.\n\n*Upgrade your processor/PC.\n\n*Get an SSD.\n\n\nA: Here is what you can do (not a solution but a workaround till you resolve the issue):\n1) Find out which process is hogging CPU when you copy large files (may be Nautilus / Thunar etc).  You can use top or htop to find it.\n2) Install cpulimit by issuing sudo apt-get install cpulimit\n3) Limit the process found in Step 1 like this\ncpulimit -e thunar -l 30\n\nWe are throttling the CPU usage by the process thunar restricting it to use 100 % of your CPU and bring your machine to a standstill.  You should be doing this only when you initiate a large file transfer / copy.\nLet know if this works.\n", "Q: Problem with xubuntu after boot from hard disk I'm now on Windows but I have Xubuntu too.\nWhen I restart my computer and boot into Xubuntu, the loading screen appears and when is time to show up the desktop, nothing happens, it remains on black screen.\nBefore an hour or two everything was fine except downloading from Internet.

Now, I want to export every single layer as an individual image (PNG format preferably) automatically to a folder somewhere.\nIs this possible?\nThe long method: Hide all layers except one, crop the section you want, export image. Hide saved layer, unhide another one, crop section, export. Repeat. Kinda cumbersome for an image with about 20 layers.\n\nA: One could export the image as an animated GIF. This will save each layer as a separate frame in the GIF.\nThen, the ImageMagick command convert -coalesce ./myfile.gif outfile%05d.png will extract the frames as PNG images.\n\nA: Certainly, this work for the plugin Export Layers to File.\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manipulate the layers in layer group.\n\n*Export texts, patterns and layer filters.\n\n*Prefix name for the image files has to be given.\n\n*Export only in jpg, png, bmp formats but the required formats can be added easily.\n\n\nA: I think you can try to find something with ImageMagick : apt-get install imagemagick.\nIt seems to be able to handle XCF format and you can export a layer in png using a [N] in the command, where N is the level of your layer.\nSource : http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=17603\nImageMagick Read Mods : http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/files/#read_mods\n\nA: The best thing about ThorSummoner's answer is that it called attention to the OpenRaster export plugin, which as it turns out lives in the file file-openraster.py in the GIMP installation.\nBy reading its code (and with some assistance from the built-in procedure browser), I was able to determine that the layers of a GIMP XCF can be saved to individual PNGs by going to Filters > Python-fu > Console in the interface, and entering the following into the built-in Python interpreter:\nimport os\n\n# If you have multiple images open, you may need to adjust\nimg = gimp.image_list()[0]\n\nsavefn = gimp.pdb['file-png-save-defaults']\noutpath = \"/home/$USER/Pictures\" # (or r\"C:\\Users\\$USER\\Pictures\", etc)\n\nfor lay in img.layers:\n    # Even if your layer names contain spaces, not a problem\n    outname = lay.name + \".png\"\n    savefn(img, lay, os.path.join(outpath, outname), outname)\n    \n    # type an extra newline to exit the indented block\n\nYou'll see the progress meter in the image window's status bar start whipping through all of your layers, writing each one to a PNG file of the same name, in whatever directory you specified as outpath. (Which must already exist, otherwise add an os.makedirs(outpath, exist_ok=True) before the loop.)\nIf any of your layer names are the same, that is a problem, because this will happily overwrite any previously-written files. Caveat GIMPtor.\nEdit: If you do have same-named layers, you could easily ignore the names and instead write out the layers in numbered files. Just replace the final loop above with something like:\nfor n, lay in enumerate(img.layers):\n    outname = f\"Layer {n:03}.png\"\n    savefn(img, lay, os.path.join(outpath, outname), outname)\n\nThat'll write the layers into PNG files named \"Layer 000.png\" through \"Layer 999.png\" (or however many layers are present, if fewer than 1000).\nIf the Gimp's version of Python doesn't support f-strings (Python 3.6+), this is exactly equivalent:\noutname = \"Layer {0:03}.png\".format(n)\n\n\nA: You may try also this plugin, Export Layers. I've tested it with png format and it worked. You just select the folder and the format and you get all the layers there, each one in its own file.\n\nA: If PNG is an acceptable output format, one option is to export it as Open Raster (.ora), an open specification for layered-image files.\n\n\n*\n\n*Export Image as Open Raster (.ora)\nFile -> Export As ...\nmyfile.ora\n\n*Open myfile.ora as an archive, with a program like file-roller or 7zip.\nOn Ubuntu:\n$ file-roller myfile.ora\n\n$ # note, later version of file-roller on ubuntu hard-code file suffixes, \n  # and refuse to open \".ora\" files, work around by renaming the file to \".zip\"\n$ ln -s myfile.ora myfile.ora.zip\n$ file-roller myfile.ora.zip\n\nalternatively\n$ unzip myfile.ora\n\nAll your layers will be png images under /data, Extract them and use at will.\n\nA: First of all you don't need any plugin. Even you don't need to crop anything. Few simple steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a layer. To do that just click on that particular layer.\n\n*Copy the layer to a clipboard using Ctrl+C\n\n*Now create new image using Ctrl+Shift+V\nThat's it. Now you can simply export that layer to any format.\n\n\n*Use Shift+Ctrl+E\n\nA: I was doing the same thing and trying to download the plugins mentioned in the answers. As the Gimp website is currently down, I could not get the plugins and I had to find another solution. \nWhat I ended up doing was use the screenshot software Shutter, which allows you to select a region of the screen and then you can repeat the same screenshot of that region with just 1 click. \nSo it becomes a 2-click per layer operation:  hide layer, screenshot, hide next layer, screenshot, ...\nMuch faster than anything else I could come up with, and takes less than a minute for 20 layers. You may lose image quality although in my case it was not a problem. \n\nA: As an alternative approach to my previous script-based suggestion, I have finally discovered that you can also do this with one of the tools available if you have the GIMP GAP installed. (That's the Gimp Animation... Package? Plugin? Something like that.)\nIt's a bit hidden in the forest of GAP menu options, but the \"Video\" menu selection \"Split Image to Frames...\" will do so by saving each layer as an individual file. In whatever format you specify (via the file extension), and with several options for how to handle the layers. Here's the dialog that came up when I chose that option after saving an un-optimized animated GIF as a 52-layer /tmp/testfile.xcf:\n\nDespite the filename preview, the frames were saved as /tmp/testfile_01.png through /tmp/testfile_52.png, as specified. (It doesn't update the displayed string in response to your selections, but it does honor them.)\n\nA: Many years later, GIMP has removed the functionality from the accepted solution and some of the other code solutions have succumbed to code rot (I'm unable to run the GIMP exporter with Python3).\nAs this is one of the first hits from Google when asking how to export layers from GIMP to their own PNG files, I feel duty bound to provide an updated answer.\nI'm using GIMP 2.10.18.\nHere is one solution that worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Export the XCF file as a PDF (File -> Export as) with the following in mind:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure to select Layers as pages (bottom layers first)\n\n*Make sure to de-select Apply layer masks before saving\n\n*Make sure to de-select Convert bitmaps to vector graphics where possible\n\n*Make sure to de-select Omit hidden layers and layers with zero opacity\n\n\n\n*Use the command line tool pdftoppm to export as PNG files.\n\nFor example, if you were to export the XCF file as the file exported_layers.pdf, the following will create each layer as it's own PNG image with the prefix out_ (e.g. out_01.png, out_01.png etc.):\npdftoppm -png -r 300 exported_layers.pdf out_\n\nThe -r option is the resolution and presumably this should match whatever default GIMP is set when exporting to PDF files. I found 300 kept the resolution in the layers of my original XCF file but your mileage may vary.\nOn Ubuntu, on can install pdftoppm by issuing:\napt-get install poppler-utils\n\n\nA: Export all frames from Gimp as MNG, then use ImageMagick for separating them to PNGs.\nconvert frames.mng frame.png\n\nImageMagick extends each file name with numbers (if you don't format the string) like \"frame-1.png\" and so on.\n", "Q: Problem with desktop environments ubuntu Ok so here is the problem in short:\nI run ubuntu 14.04 LTS with two desktop environments: Gnome which i usually use and spectrwm.\nI removed gnome (followed instructions from somewhere) and left out with spectrwm.\nI accidentally ran the following command: \"sudo apt-get remove unity* ubuntu-desktop\"\nWhich caused a disaster (cant access any desktop environment even spectrwm, running on low graphics mode, ...) so how do I revert my last command ?\nBy the way I tried to reinstall ubuntu-desktop and it gave me unmet dependencies errors, I did not try installing any unity package because I do not know which packages got removed because of this command.\nThank you all I really appreciate your help.\n\nA: To find all unity packages that where removed type this command:\ndpkg --list | grep -P '^rc  unity.*' | awk '{print $2}'\n\nYou need to reinstall all those.

Note, that this is effective only until the next reboot.  Edit /etc/hostname for permanent change.\n\n       Note, that only the super-user can change the names.\n\n       It is not possible to set the FQDN or the DNS domain name with the dnsdomainname command (see THE FQDN below).\n\n       The host name is usually set once at system startup in /etc/init.d/hostname.sh (normally by reading the contents of a file which contains the host name, e.g.  /etc/hostname).\n\nSo I'd try\nsudo nano /etc/hostname\n\nAnd change it there to what you like, and then reboot.\n", "Q: what program should i use with a gzip archive I am trying to download grub-1.99.tar.gz ,I do not know what program to use to open  a \nGzip file. please recommend\n\nA: What you actually have is a tarball, so you'll want to use the tar command.\n tar -zxvf grub-1.99.tar.gz\n\nIf you had a file that was only .gz (and not .tar.gz) you would use\ngunzip grub-199.gz\n\n\nA: Musher is spot-on.

There was a small warning in red text around the Erase hard drive option that said it would delete all my files, but I clicked Continue anyway because I assumed I'd be given an option to Revert or some kind of warning if this really would mess up my system. Instead though, it sent me to the Choose Your Location screen within the applet and the back button became grayed and unusable, which is when I worried that it may have messed up my partitions. (It technically has no valid OS I can boot from now...)\nI exited the installer then and shut down, and upon trying to boot into windows I simply had a black screen with a \"_\" sign at the top left hand corner phasing in and out, without any ability to access windows, or any other OS because I actually didn't install Linux but just let the applet reconfigure the partitions.\nMy first question to all of you out there is A, Is there any simple way I can get my partition structure back and boot into windows, especially seeing how it was so easy to revert modified partitions within the Ubuntu applet, and HOW?!\nI've installed Ubuntu-Rescue-Remix onto a usb and am messing with it using TestDisk and their guide but it either doesn't seem to be working or I have no idea what I'm doing. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of clear answers about how to undo something which is as simple as a messed up file structure, so if this isn't the best way, anyone who knows better please give a shout out or advice!\nWorst case I guess I'll just fully install Ubuntu on the computer and try to salvage the files onto an external hard drive and reinstall Windows. Either this or take it to a specialist. It just seems stupid that a simple Continue button being clicked/tapped is the difference between the user moving on to something else or being hit with something they have to go through immense trouble to fix. \n\n\n*\n\n*update, this guy had the same problem: Windows 7 to Ubuntu - erased data / but additional suggestions or links to step by steps appreciated\n\n*does boot-repair work for this?\n..........\n\n\nMy second question, B, is a request: Is there any way the Ubuntu Install Applets' developers would consider adding warning features like bright flashing lights or a Warning Popup to tell you that hard drive erasure is not easily reversible if you press Continue from within the applet, like how Windows and other OS security and system popups often do when they're warning that you might be about to do something stupid? Or advice that we need to either destroy a partition structure and risk data loss or resize the partition safely on our main operating system in order to install Ubuntu safely?\nIf I'd been told by the Applet clearly that I had no options to install Linux without messing with partitions and risking data loss, I would have just taken it to a computer specialist about the Windows computer going slow or freezing after login instead of having to play specialist or hire one to salvage my data. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's had this problem, and it seems like a simple fix like this could save people a lot of frustration and heartache, both in Ubuntu from Canonical and forks from the Mint and Kubuntu projects.\nPlease Ubuntu developers, help the 'visual-learners' and novice-tinkerers who need to be given flashing warning signs in order to not destroy their computers!!! Do it for the Children!!! Do it for the Exclamation Points!!! Do it for Me, so I don't feel as bad about this mistake being repeated again despite this bad experience with it!!!!! Please/ Just/ Do It!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nA: If you want to recover your Windows files, STOP USING THE DISK IMMEDIATELY!!! Do NOT install anything on the disk!!! Instead, use TestDisk or PhotoRec (or tools like them) to attempt to recover your partitions or individual files, respectively. In the case of file recovery, you'll need a separate disk big enough to hold your files; recovering files to the target disk is likely to end up overwriting more data, thus losing it.\nOf course, you should have a backup. I know, I'm one of those annoying people who says \"make your backups,\" \"eat your spinach,\" etc. Well, now you know why we say such things.\nFinally, if you think that the explicit and eye-catching warnings you were given were inadequate, you can file a bug report. It's very unlikely that the people responsible for any given program will read your complaint here.\n", "Q: After first software update on ubuntu 14.04 pc boots to a black screen I've installed ubuntu 14.04 twice on my OptiPlex 990 Dell computer.

All I wanted was to be able to have a dual boot Windows7/Ubuntu, the latter being a backup when my Windows get a bit slow. It's been working fine, and I have mostly been browsing on firefox with it.\nI have very little knowledge of Ubuntu (I don't know how to do commands, \"sudo\" things etc). I've looked up my question a few times, and words such as \"kernel\" pop up, which confuse me.\nSo please, be tolerant and patient with me! :)\nA few days ago, my laptop fell from the desk (cables hanging, pulled on by a foot...). I've had this laptop for over 3 years and it fell a few times (I'm very clumsy), nothing major happened to it appart from a few scuffs. Yet, since this happened, my computer seems to refuse to boot properly, and at the \"Grub\" ,where you select between Ubuntu and Windows, I get the error \"Attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0'\".\nIf I try to boot Windows, nothing happens.\nI suspect it is due to the computer falling and possibly damaging the Hard Drive, but I am not sure.\nI did try and install a few programs before (such as VLC etc) while on Ubuntu, attempting at the \"sudo\" thingies... Could I have done something wrong to mess up the whole hard drive?\nIn any case, since this happened, I have not been able to boot my computer, and right now am using an old laptop to post this message.\nI have a little bit of knowledge on dismantling laptops, so I removed the hard drive from the laptop and connected it to this one. It does the same error, so I confirmed (to myself) that it wasn't hardware problems of the laptop but just the Hard Drive.\nThank you for your time, and many thanks if you can help me!\n\nA: This almost definitely seems like a hardware issue. Try making another live-boot disk or USB drive (ubuntu) and booting into that. If you can mount your hard drive (via the file manager) it isn't a hardware issue, and would be something else. However, hd0 is the name that GRUB gives to your hard drive, so if it (suddenly) doesn't see it, it's likely not due to software. \nAlternatively, try booting into your BIOS and see if it can see your hard drive. Either way, I'd be surprised if it's not a hard drive failure.\n\nA: The mere fact that you get errors after a drop, and such severe ones that makes it not boot, is a sure sign of something being very wrong. \nComputer software cannot run well on \"bumpy roads\" and that shows.\nThe very best option you have is to replace all hardware. \nMore: There may well be small fractions in (one or more...) PCBs which show up in intermittent manner, which is really bad if you want to keep your data intact. \nVideo, Music and similar content might not be that important to keep 100% intact, but when the software read from storage (harddisk) doesn't read correctly - then you're on your own, you will likely see obscure and intermittent fails.\nAnother source of strange faults is power supply malfunction. e.g. harddisks need both 5 and 12V feeds, if 12V fails the platters will stop rotating - read/write faults will appear, even if those failures are very short. You might not notice such a failure until it is too late - when you loose data.\nThe end result is very similar when the 5V supply fails, that could be called \"brain damage\" on the behalf of a harddisk.\n", "Q: Can't see desktop I tried to remove the guest account following the instructions on this page\nRemoving Guest Session at login in Ubuntu 14.04\nI followed the steps and then restarted the laptop.

In the BIOS, UEFI is enabled. I am trying to dual boot Lubuntu 14.04 with preinstalled 64 bit Windows 7.\nI booted from a live-USB and there were two options, a normal USB boot option (something like 'Transcend...') and also an option with a UEFI prefix ('UEFI:Transcend...').\nWhich of these should I select? Does Windows 7 require UEFI boot? Or should I disable UEFI in the BIOS?\n\nA: Do not disable UEFI if you plan on dual-booting. The general rule is either both UEFI or both MBR, but mixing does not work (one OS will not be visible and won't boot).\nThen, install Ubuntu on a separate partition (see other guides for that).\nNow, Ubuntu will have installed GRUB2 as the UEFI bootloader, and you will be able to start Windows from GRUB2 (Ubuntu adds the \"Boot into Windows\" option automatically). At this point, most people are done. Booting will be UEFI->GRUB2->Linux or UEFI->GRUB2->WindowsBootMgr->Windows, thus you will be chainloading Windows through GRUB2.\n\nIf you'd rather have two different UEFI bootloaders so that you can select Ubuntu or Windows directly from the BIOS (like you would select booting from the DVD drive etc), you can follow the guide here or my abridged version on SuperUser here. \nThen, booting would be UEFI->GRUB2->Linux or UEFI->WindowsBootMgr->Windows, and there would be no chainloading.\nIf you plan on doing this, I recommend you make a full backup of your /EFI partition and the files on it from Windows before proceeding. Mounting the EFI partition is described here or on SuperUser here.\n\nEDIT, to clarify on whether you should install using UEFI or not: What is set in your BIOS is not that important. What is important is whether your Windows was installed using UEFI or not. If it is, you need to install Ubuntu using UEFI (the liveUSB needs to boot using UEFI). If Windows does not use UEFI, then neither should Ubuntu. \nSee also here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Case_when_Ubuntu_must_be_installed_in_EFI_mode\nChecking whether your Windows is booted as UEFI: Multiple possibilities are described here\nChecking whether your Ubuntu (Live CD) booted as UEFI: Multiple possibilities are described here\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite P55-A: Cant boot from usb For a few days now I have been trying to install Ubuntu (also tried Fedora, BackTrack, and Kali) onto an 8GB usb drive.

I even tried turning off usb 3.0 to see if that could be a compatibility issue.\nIf anyone has any insight into this issue I would be more than willing to offer all needed information.\nMy laptop: Toshiba Satellite P55-A running windows 8.1 on 64 bit\n\nA: For anyone who has had this same issue the answer was to go into the BIOS and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable \"Fast Boot\"\n\n*Disable \"Secure Boot\"\n\n*Switch to CSM boot mode (under advanced)\n\n*Enable USB Legacy Mode\n\n\nPosted from ubuntu 14\n", "Q: what is the keyboard shortcut for switching to subscript or superscript while using libre office I just want to know how to switch to superscript or subscript while using libre office as many of my documents are chemistry and physics based which require a lot of subscript and superscript to write molecular formulae and physical formulae. coming to the point, can I get a keyboard short cut for superscript or subscript\n\nA: You can use\nCtrl+Shift+P   Superscript\nCtrl+Shift+B   Subscript\nLibreOffice Writer Help\n\nA: Ctrl + Shift + P - Superscript\nCtrl + Shift + B - Subscript\n", "Q: How do I write an iptables rule to limit Internet bandwidth usage of user or IP address How do I control or limit Internet bandwidth usage of users/computer/IP address in network with the help of iptables rules?\nI have one static IP address which provides Internet (that is, WAN). I assigned this to eth0 and the local network IP address as 192.168.0.1 (LAN) which is eth1. This machine is acting as my gateway and DHCP server. If it is possible, can I use the MAC address to identify the machine?\n\nA: You basically asked two questions. The answers are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, you can't limit bandwidth using iptables. iptables is more of a firewall like thing which uses IP addressing as its mode of functioning. You can use the built-in program \"tc\" (traffic control) to fulfill your need of restricting the bandwidth. Many ISPs use tc to control their bandwidth. Usage of tc is complex, see the manpage of tc to get basic ideas.\n\n*You can use the command \"arp -n\" to see the MAC addresses of the connected hosts along with their IP addresses. So if you use your server as the gateway to the Internet then by using \"arp -n\" you'll see the MAC & IP addresses of all the devices of the local network currently connected to the server and also the MAC addresses & IP addresses of the server itself.\n\nA: You can mark , loop and drop packets in iptables. I have seen examples people does rate control with iptables.\n# Limit packet traffic on a TCP or UDP port:\niptables -A INPUT -p $proto --destination-port $port --syn -m state --state NEW -m limit --limit $lim/s --limit-burst $lb -j ACCEPT\n\n# Limit established/related packet traffic:\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -m limit --limit $lim/s --limit-burst $lb -j ACCEPT\n\nfrom: https://serverfault.com/questions/340256/should-i-rate-limit-packets-with-iptables\n\nA: I use this to limit the traffic on my router for a range of IPs, but you need to have access to the router shell via ssh or telnet.\n#enable the limitation\niptables -I FORWARD -m iprange --dst-range 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.70 -j DROP\n\niptables -I FORWARD -m iprange --dst-range 192.168.1.50-192.168.1.70 -m limit --limit 100/sec -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\n#disable it\niptables -D FORWARD 1\niptables -D FORWARD 1\n\n", "Q: hash value on directory I want to verify integrity of folder.

It's not the same:\n/etc/nsswitch.conf is a configuration file to configure, where the system should get it's databases. Databses for users, groups, passwords, dns lookups and so on. For example when you change the owner (chown) or the permissions (chmod) of a file. Then the system needs to know how the uids and gids should be interpreted; from the files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group) or from an LDAP server (or both) or from another service (NIS, AD, Kerberos). Also nsswitch-related is the priority in case of dublicate entries.\nPAM is a component that defines, what at authentication, password change or session start should happen. PAM grants or denies the access. It mounts filesystem that needs to be mounted at a user login (pam_mount.so), execs login scripts (pam_exec.so), authenticates over unix method (pam_unix.so) or via LDAP (pam_ldap.so). It passes the password provided by the user from module to module and (however configured) the modules may break the stack or not. That ends in a successful or unsuccessful authentication.\n", "Q: Restart an install process I started installing phpmyadmin via SSH on an Ubuntu server and got to a question I couldn't answer and had to close. How do I resume the installation or stop it and start over? \nThe command sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin gives the error:\ncould not get lock [path] - open\nunable to lock the administration directory\n\nThe command ps aux | grep apt gives 4 processes including apt-get install phpmyadmin.\nBTW, the question I had was whether I should use dbconfig-common when I have existing databases. The explanation was confusing.\n\nA: I've never used SSH to connect to servers, but if I were having this problem on a local machine I would reboot to get rid of the lock problem, and then type \"sudo apt-get install --reinstall phpmyadmin\"\n\nA: It would be better if you restarted your ubuntu server to release the lock and then, try to reinstall phpmyadmin.\nAs a last resource you can delete the lock file, this is discussed here:\nUnable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?\n", "Q: Byobu statusbars of 2 different servers are still different after resetting Byobu I have two computers running 14.04 where I use Byobu with tmux backend. The difference between both is that one uses an existing home directory that was backed up and transfered to a fresh installation while the other one is a completely new installation.\nThe issue: Both Byobu statusbars look different\n\nIt's not only the yellow background that is different on the completely new installation on the lower bar in the image, but also the font weight and font color. If you look even closer, you find that GHz, G and seemingly % aren't bold on the lower bar.\nAttempted troubleshooting\n\n\n*\n\n*Read: How do I reset Byobu's settings?\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried deleting both ~/.byobu folders.\n\n*Tried configuring with byobu-config and byobu-select-profile.\n\n*Purged and reinstalled Byobu on the machine that shows the upper statusbar.\n\n\n*Tried searching with find for tmux and byobu in /usr and /home/$USER to find related files, but no luck.\n\n*Searched for differences in backups of both ~/.byobu folders. Still no luck.\n\n*Restarted gnome-terminal and Byobu instances several times.\n\n\nFurther details\nThe upper statusbar is directly from my desktop, while the computer giving me the lower statusbar is connected via SSH. I assume that this doesn't make any difference. As written above, the terminal client is gnome-terminal, background transparency is disabled and both gnome-terminal instances have the same color profile loaded.\nIt feels like I'm missing something obvious, but I'm currently at my wits' end.\nQuestion: How to get a consistent statusbar?\nOr more precisely: How can I get a consistent default Byobu statusbar displayed across machines?\n\nFurther investigation\nIn the mean time I found that, while I had reset the configuration, the custom Byobu prompt was not enabled. I ran byobu-enable-prompt to enable it. (This adds the line [ -r /home/$USER/.byobu/prompt ] && . /home/$USER/.byobu/prompt   #byobu-prompt# to ~/.bashrc)\nI found that there exists /usr/bin/byobu-status-detail which gives a detailed overview about the configuration and compared portions of if like for the load average:\n#[default]#[fg=black,bg=brightyellow]6.53#[default]#[fg=\\#EEEEEE]#[bg=\\#333333]\n        (load_average)\n        6.53 5.93 5.87 8/1066 27196\n\n#[default]#[fg=black,bg=brightyellow]0.00#[default]#[fg=\\#EEEEEE]#[bg=\\#333333]\n        (load_average)\n        0.00 0.01 0.05  2/444 3717\n\nStrangely, there is no difference there. Dug a little bit further around in /usr/lib/byobu and /usr/share/byobu.\nA hint at the solution\nHowever, when I switched to the other machines desktop and connected to both Byobu instances everything was as it should be! This is interesting.\n\nA: Looks like this was an issue with rotten default settings of gnome-terminal. I opened Profile Preferences from the Edit menu, went to the Compatibility tab, clicked Reset Compatibility Options to Defaults, closed the running terminal and opened a new one. Now the issue is gone.\n", "Q: Too many Partitions on drive, can't dual boot ubuntu alongside win8 on Thinkpad I have a Thinkpad S431 with Windows 8. It has a 128gb SSD, and My partitions are WINRE_DRV, Windows8_OS, Lenovo_Recovery, 7gb Hibernation Partition. I also have allocated 20gb for Ubuntu. \nWhen I tried to install Ubuntu, it told me that I have too many OS's on the machine, and the new partition I created is labeled \"unusable\". \nWhat can I do? \nEdit: Volume type is MBR. \nI have deleted an unnecessary windows 8 partition from Gparted in the Try Ubuntu option. From there I have also formatted the drive to be ext4 on /dev/sda4 Now the problem is that Ubuntu will not install as \"root file system is not detected\" \nI used ext2 as the filesystem for Ubuntu, and mount as '/'. This solved my problems!\n\nA: You must make extended partitions. A MS-DOS partition table allows a maximum of 4 primary partitions.\nDon't try to shrink or split a primary partition in two that is located before the extended partitions because you may alter partition table.\n\nI also have allocated 20gb for Ubuntu.\n\nInstead of allocating Ubuntu partitions from Windows, you should delete/shrink partitions to leave empty space in Windows. Then let Ubuntu partition manager create partitions on that empty space.\n\nA: First look at, do all of them(partitions) work as primary partition. IF it is, use partition tool like 'gparted'or 3rd party tool to dis-select any of them who are not working as OS containing partition. This is because, primary partition is only be needed where a partition contain an OS.\n", "Q: How to disable the [HP] ACPI button for the wireless card? I have Ubuntu 14.04 running on a Compaq CQ60 laptop. Ever since I installed Ubuntu (back on 12.04), the \"toggle wireless\" button next to the power button hard locks the WiFi adapter, causing me to have to run the sudo rfkill unlock wifi command in Terminal.\nIssue is, other people use the computer and press the button by accident when I'm not around to fix it, causing the laptop to be (basically) useless.

In this setup, MAAS and openstack share 10.0.0.0/24 as their management network, while Quantum charm is connected via eth0 to public network 10.0.10.0. I am able to spawn instances, and assign floating ip addresses to them. I can also ping to and from public network. Furthermore, the 2 cirros instances, which are on the same subnet, can ssh each other. However, am not able to ssh to instances either through router namespace, i.e., ip netns exec qr-xxxx ssh -i <full path to key> cirros@privateipaddr, or from outside. I've generated key-pairs both through dashboard and nova, with similar results. Also tried chmod 0600 key, ssh-add key to no avail. A sample output is shown here http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7676660/,\nwhich eventually times out.

But try to avoid this because it is too risky.\" Can someone please explain to me why is it that risky and unsafe ?\nThank you all for your time,\nRegards.\n\nA: It's good practice to backup to a separate device anytime you're doing drive management activities like partitioning, or applying file systems because they can put your partition table at risk. For example if the installation fails during the partitioning portion it could corrupt the partition table and make all the partitions unreadable. You would end up needing to use recovery software to get any data off the drive. \nAlso it's easier to mistakenly choose the wrong partition to install to; not likely but it does happen :P even by skilled users. \nThese are worst case senarios. There is nothing wrong with using a partition on the same drive as long as you understand and are willing to accept the risk.\n", "Q: Street view goes to black in google maps My street view in google maps stopped working in a recent update.\nIt starts ok, and I can rotate the view, but when I move to another location I only get a black screen, and need to reenter googlemaps from the front page to get normal view again\n\nA: Go to \"chrome://flags\" in your browser.

How do I upgrade from TeX Live 2013 to TeX Live 2014 on Ubuntu 14.04 ?\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the \"netinstaller\" for TeXLive install-tl-unx.tar.gz from any CTAN mirror, e.g. this one.\nThis \"netinstaller\" is not a full download, but just a small executable and will download all packages from the internet based on the requirements you set later. For more information, see the install guide.\n\n*Extract it somewhere, e.g. in ~/texlive/2014.\nmkdir ~/texlive/2014\ncd ~/texlive/2014\ntar -xf /path/to/install-tl-unx.tar.gz\ncd install-tl-20140831 # depends on your installer version, adjust to your situation\n\n\n*Run the install-tl binary with root privileges, e.g. (adjust to your situation):\nsudo ./install-tl\n\nNote: If you have a single-user machine, or don't have root\nprivileges, I would recommend installing to your home directory\ninstead (omit sudo in the previous command). The reason is that\ncommands like tlmgr (see below) will not work out of the box if they\nare run with sudo, see Setting TeX Live path for root for\nmore information.\nOptionally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the -select-repository option in order to select a CTAN mirror nearby before downloading anything.\n\n*Add the -gui=perltk option to use a GUI installer. Install the perl-tk package first! (sudo apt-get install perl-tk) See the screenshot below how it should look like.\n\n*Configure only specific collections by choosing the menu option C to save bandwidth and space. Be warned: the default set of 47 collections will yield more than 2GB of traffic and disk usage. You can always install more collections later with the TeXLive package manager (tlmgr) and the collection--prefixed meta-packages.\n\n\n*Choose I for install in the menu. (If not in GUI mode)\nIt installs in /usr/local/texlive/2014 by default.\n\n*The installer output suggests to adjust some environment variables. Do so by editing your ~/.profile (or ~/.bashrc if you like) and add the following lines:\nTEXDIR=\"/usr/local/texlive/2014\"\nexport PATH=$TEXDIR/bin/i386-linux:$PATH    # for 32-bit installation\nexport PATH=$TEXDIR/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH  # for 64-bit installation\nexport INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:$TEXDIR/texmf-dist/doc/info\nexport MANPATH=$MANPATH:$TEXDIR/texmf-dist/doc/man\n\nLog out and log back in to receive the new variables, or, source the file, e.g. source ~/.profile to activate it for your current shell. This last step should make sure your application actually use your new 2014 local TeXLive installation rather than the Ubuntu packaged one. Some tools will require you to configure that yourself, see for example this on TeXWorks.\nHere's how the GUI installer looks like:\n\n\n*Finally, to install new packages you need to setup a Texlive package database (TLPDB). See this post for more information. In summary, you have to run:\nsudo apt-get install xzdec\nsudo tlmgr init-usertree\n\nthen you can install a new package, for example, to install package wrapfig, run:\nsudo env PATH=\"$PATH\" tlmgr install wrapfig\n\nor if you installed in your home directory, you can omit sudo:\ntlmgr install wrapfig\n\n", "Q: How may I deactivate the touchpad?

I am getting a new laptop soon and unfortunately it only has 256gb ssd. I don't really want to partition it since that would leave me with a meager amount of space. I also want to keep my Windows 8.1. Therefore I am considering to either boot Ubuntu from an external hard drive or run it through a virtual machine and store the data on the external. \nWhich one is safer? Since the external hdd is connected via usb 3.0, there is a risk of disconnecting the usb cord during runtime and I am afraid this would cause a number of problems such as data corruption. Therefore, would a virtual machine be a safer bet? Or are there better options available?\n\nA: When It is a laptop, I think, it is better on using virtual machine. Because you move it as much than if it is a static PC (a Desktop one).\nI used to install ubuntu on harddisk and it disconnected often when used on laptop (just by moving slightly). The system will freeze and bump! nothing to do but restarting it.\nI recommend you to use your second option.\nEnsure your /home dir is in laptop and other files go to external disk. Because losing (disconnecting) you /home will freeze it also.\n\nA: I use an external drive for Ubuntu on my Windows 7 laptop and it works great. I went into BIOS and set the boot priority to the USB port to be first, the internal HD second. So if I forget to turn the external drive on it boots into windows normally.\nSince the Windows OS was present when I installed Ubuntu, when booting to the external drive, I get the Ubuntu boot menu where I can choose Windows as a alternative.\nThe technical part: I use an external USB3 docking device (Thermaltake Blacx) and a bare 128GB SSD. It's very fast. The ultrabook I use has an internal SSD as well. I installed from a USB2 flashdrive and selected the external drive as the destination Ubuntu boot. I've had no issues. The USB drive has never disconnected itself, and I can't imagine why it would.\n\nA: Any power interrumption can cause data corrumption..\nbut if you create a live usb are fast enought to store your config and install applications but whule running will primarily reside  on the memory of your computer and memory does not care if your pc goes unexpectedly off \nBut if you care about your external hhd. try to not interrumpt it while working. many flash drives never goes up again due to this.\nand so with a VM you will be a more secure but will consume more resources and you will probably face hardware or driver limitations.\nThe best ever thing you can do is give to your linux  a very small partition and minimal swap space. based on your needs , choose a distro with small disk space requirement and go on.\n", "Q: Can we install CDH4 on new Ubuntu 14.04 Can any one share the steps to follow in installing CDH4 on UBUNTU  14.04 version.\n\nA: CDH (current version 5.0.3) is not currently supported with Ubuntu 14.04.\nHowever, you can try\n\n\n*\n\n*manual installation method\n\n*this blog here\n\n*adding the repos for CDH for ubuntu 12 to your ubuntu 14 and installing using apt-get\n\n\nYour Mileage May Vary\nI could never get the Cloudera Manager to get it working, but have installed CDH components manually with great success using point 3 above.\n", "Q: I can't do hibernate to my PC due to swap partition size is equal zero?

I haven't notice a great advantage in day to day equipment use 64 bits or 32  unless some software requires it\nServer or unix based systems have a great advantage in speed. you can notice it, but really at windows I never notice it ...\nOfcourse 64 bit handle more memory but even windows xp can handle 2gb of memory.\nRumors say that windows 8 requires even less than 7 and I believe it too.\nAll this as my very personal experience. notice that i say day to day.. and not a professional equipment although probably that presario will not fit anyway.\nOn linux please give a try to the latest LTS ubuntu or derivatives as you are new user.\nIf you processor handle 64 bit instructions then use it. \nremember processor and system and at least many unix distros are capable to handle 32 when you OS are 64... so you will be able to use 32 and 64 bits softwares within a 64 bits OS.\n", "Q: problems with games using wine version 1.5 on ubuntu version 12.04 My problem is that the screen only occupies the corner of the screen.

I can browse and see the windows raid windows partition but grub2 does not see list windows uefi.\nIn UEFI BIOS I can select UEFI Windows boot manager or UEFI Ubuntu boot manager and each will boot respectively from their own boot manager.  However I want to add the UEFI Windows boot manger to grub2 so I can select the OS from GRUB2 and not have to go into bios to choose OS.   \nHow can I do this?  I tried boot repair but it seems to screw things up to the point of reinstall. I wonder is there is a way to manually add the windows boot loader to grub2 and daisy chain UEFI Windows boot manager?\nCheers,\nMartin\n\nA: In theory, it should probably be working, although your use of RAID on Windows might have thrown a monkey wrench into it. I can think of a number of possible solutions. The first is to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and create an entry resembling the following:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nYou may need to change (hd0,gpt1) to identify the EFI System Partition (ESP) where the Windows boot loader is stored. With this done, type sudo update-grub to add the manual entry to GRUB.\nA second option is to run Boot Repair, which often does a better job of identifying strange GRUB setups than do the stock Ubuntu GRUB scripts. The danger is that Boot Repair occasionally makes matters worse, particularly with exotic setups. If you run Boot Repair, be sure to save the URL that it gives you. If it doesn't work, you can post that URL back here to give us more detailed information about your setup.\nFinally, you could try my rEFInd boot manager. If you do this, I recommend you start with the USB flash drive or CD-R version; you can try these without making changes to your disk setup or boot loader options list, so the risk factor is very low. If you can boot both Ubuntu and Windows from the rEFInd external medium, install the raw Debian package or PPA in Ubuntu.\nYou can try these options in any order you like.\n\nA: I have successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the machine which has Windows 7 installed on two raid solid-state drives that are formatted with gpt and use UEFI. Ubuntu is actually installed on the third non-raid solid-state drive. The following steps describe the situation. I installed it on a motherboard which is the Asus X79 Deluxe. There are two more raid drives, each consisting of two regular hard drives that are formatted under Windows to be used for storage of data.\nThe first step is to turn off fast boot and enable raid controller to be entered using ctrl+I command by adjusting the UEFI setting to force display and turn off fast boot as well as secure boot. Then I entered their Intel raid BIOS and also used -ctrl+M for the other controller to make my RAID partitions. Then used Windows 7 DVD installed it onto the RAID partition. Everything under Windows works well after install.\nIn the second step I booted the Ubuntu 14.04 live CD using UEFI boot and then once booted into the CD I did the install of / and swap. I also made first partition of the Windows as the boot loader destination, that is why there is an extra partition in the first set. The installation went fine but then on reboot grub2 does not show up and the only way to boot into the two operating systems is by selecting where to boot from in the UEFI bios. I then went and installed boot-repair which must be installed on the newly installed Ubuntu system, with the option of secure boot turned off and follow the instructions. I tried using the boot-repair cd and installing it on the live CD ubuntu boot and the boot-repair launches but wants to convert everything to MBR instead this enabled me to get the Grub2 to show up without the capability to select Windows when booting from the Linux solid-state drive.\nI finally added option one from above and it allowed me to put the Windows boot manager into the grub2 so now everything works as it should.\nIt took quite a few reinstalls and messing about to finally get to that stage.

When IOMMU is off, it won't even boot.\nI've circumvented this by adding iommu=pt iommu=1 to the end of the line where syslinux defines the boot image.

Is there a way to be completely sure that sshd will automatically start after reboot. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: There are some ways. You can create a cronjob which runs at reboot to start the SSH daemon. You can create a script which runs when the network comes up and starts the SSH daemon (via Network Manager's dispatcher facility, for example). You could add a command to /etc/rc.local to start the SSH service. You could write an Upstart job (and thus duplicate some work).\nHowever, the fact is that the SSH service is autostarted by default. As long as the network comes up fine, you should be able to SSH into the system.

It shows the regular Gnome icons. How can I change these?\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: It depends on the icon theme.\nThe Icon themes are in /usr/share/icons\nEach theme has an \"index.theme\" file and this file will have \"Inherits\" listed on about the 4th line of the file. It is likely that this icon theme uses the Gnome theme as a default \"Inherits\" to provide icons not supplied by the theme (missing icons).\nOne way to change this is to edit the Inherits field in the /usr/share/icons/themename/index.theme file to point to a different (Inherits) theme to fall back on some theme other than Gnome. (Don't forget to change \"themename\" to the actual name of the theme)\nOr, search through the theme folders try to locate the icons you do not like. Delete these icons and replace these icons with the icons of your choice but make sure to name the new icons the same names the old icons had so when you re-load the theme the new icons will automatically load under the given names.\n", "Q: How to select video quality from youtube-dl? I have installed youtube-dl in my 14.04. \nI can download video by following command,\n$ youtube-dl [youtube-link]\n\nBut I want to know how to select available pixel quality of youtube video(i.e 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc). \nIn software description they said it's possible(shown in image below), but how to do.. \n\n\nA: To select specific resolutions, you can specify the size and audio quality so they get selected automatically - so for 480p:\n-f 'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio/best[height<=480]'\n\nwith bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio/best[height<=720] for 720p etc. This can added to config file at ~/.config/youtube-dl/config (or even /etc/youtube-dl.conf) so you don't get oversized downloads:\nmkdir ~/.config/youtube-dl\necho \"-f 'bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio/best[height<=720]'\" >> ~/.config/youtube-dl/config\n\nYou can use --ignore-config if you want to disable the configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.\nPlease note that fairly often it will have to download a separate video and audio steam and merge them.\nFor more examples see youtube-dl's doucmentation.\n\nA: A bash wrapper script that

audio and video tracks that are available as a single file:\nyoutube-dl -f best 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pzm5b6FFY'\n\nIf you encounter any error during the muxing process or an issue with the video quality selection, you can use one of the following commands:\nyoutube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestvideo+bestaudio' --merge-output-format mp4 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pzm5b6FFY'\n\nor as Gabriel Staples pointed out here, the following command will typically select the actual best single file video quality resolution instead of video quality bit-rate:\nyoutube-dl -f best 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pzm5b6FFY'\n\nThese commands will ensure you download the highest quality mp4 video and m4a audio from the video as a single file or will merge them back into a single mp4 (using ffmpeg in my case). If ffmpeg or avconv is not available, youtube-dl should fall back to the single file -f best option instead of the default.\nClick here for more detailed information and some different examples.\nAlso, click to see this related answer by Gabriel Staples.\n\nSource: www.webupd8.org/2014/02/video-downloader-youtube-dl-gets.html\nSource: github.com/rg3/youtube-dl\n\nA: Here is an explanation of streams/formats for anyone new to youtube-dl.\nSome video sites, such as youtube, offer not only different resolutions of video to download, but have options in youtube-dl called formats to download video and audio separately.

If I selected to download one of those formats by using the specified format code such as with -f 137, I would really get either an audio file or a video file with no audio, which is usually not what you want. If I had ffmpeg installed and specified both video and audio formats with -f 137+140, then youtube-dl would download video and audio and afterwards combine them together into one video file.\nIf you don't have ffmpeg installed, youtube-dl will by default select the highest quality format that has both audio and video. This maxes out at 720p (and is usually specified by format code 22 so you would download with -f 22). If you do have ffmpeg installed, youtube-dl will be able download the real best quality video (1080p or better if available) and best quality audio, and after downloading mux (combine) them together into one video file so this is what I recommend.\nSummary: install ffmpeg and then you will be able to simply do youtube-dl [youtube url] without any flags to get the best quality video and audio automatically in one output video file.\n\nA: Some of the other options to download the best quality videos other than that mentioned here depending on your convenience is given below:\nDownload best mp4 format available or any other best if no mp4 available\n$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best'\n\nDownload best format available but not better that 480p\n$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio/best[height<=480]'\n\nDownload best video only format but no bigger than 50 MB\n$ youtube-dl -f 'best[filesize<50M]'\n\nDownload best format available via direct link over HTTP/HTTPS protocol\n$ youtube-dl -f '(bestvideo+bestaudio/best)[protocol^=http]'\n\nReference:\nDirectly from youtube-dl github page\n\nA: You can download 1080p using youtube-dl, but you need to do a little extra work.  Usually it will only download 720p as its max even if you can see 1080p on youtube.com.\nRun with -F to see available formats:\nyoutube-dl -F https://www.youtube.com/watch\\?v\\=-pxRXP3w-sQ\n\n171         webm      audio only  DASH audio  115k , audio@128k (44100Hz), 2.59MiB (worst)\n140         m4a       audio only  DASH audio  129k , audio@128k (44100Hz), 3.02MiB\n141         m4a       audio only  DASH audio  255k , audio@256k (44100Hz), 5.99MiB\n160         mp4       256x144     DASH video  111k , 12fps, video only, 2.56MiB\n247         webm      1280x720    DASH video 1807k , 1fps, video only, 23.48MiB\n136         mp4       1280x720    DASH video 2236k , 24fps, video only, 27.73MiB\n248         webm      1920x1080   DASH video 3993k , 1fps, video only, 42.04MiB\n137         mp4       1920x1080   DASH video 4141k , 24fps, video only, 60.28MiB\n43          webm      640x360\n18          mp4       640x360\n22          mp4       1280x720    (best)\n\nnotice that youtube-dl has labeled the last option 1280x720 as the 'best' quality and that's what it will download by default, but that the line starting with 137 is actually higher quality 1920x1080.  Youtube has separated the video and audio streams for the lines labeled DASH so we also need to pick the highest quality audio which in this case is the line starting with 141.  Then we run youtube-dl again this time specifying the audio and video:\nyoutube-dl -f 137+141 https://www.youtube.com/watch\\?v\\=-pxRXP3w-sQ\n\nand it will download the 1080p video and auto-merge it with the highest-quality audio.  It should also auto-deleted the separate downloaded parts.  This method is a little extra work, but will get you the best results.\n\nA: Update: use yt-dlp instead of youtube-dl! It's a fork off of youtube-dl and is much better-maintained and works much better! See a little more on yt-dlp in my answer here.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the latest version of youtube-dl installed.\nHow to install the latest version of youtube-dl\nSee:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/#installation\n\n*https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/#how-do-i-update-youtube-dl\nRun these commands:\n# On Linux Ubuntu:\n\n# 1. Check your current version\nyoutube-dl --version\n\n# 2.Uninstall your current version, if necessary\nsudo apt remove -y youtube-dl\n\n# 3. Now, install the latest version\nsudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl\n\n# 4. Check your current version to ensure it updated\nyoutube-dl --version\n\nHow to get the best video quality available.\nThis answer here, with the most votes, should be right to give you the best video quality available, but....it's not always. bestvideo+bestaudio seems to choose only the best video and best audio of the options that are video only and audio only, then it merges the two together. Note that this also appears to be identical to the default behavior of youtube-dl. However, on the video I was looking at, the best quality was a single, pre-merged file that was already in a format with combined video and audio. The bestvideo+bestaudio option did NOT choose this best quality 720p file because it was looking only for separate video and audio files. Details below.\nSolution?

For the moment I have Win7 installed. On this one I have 6 HDD : 1X SSD (for the system), 2X HDD of 3TB, 2X HDD of 500GB and 1X HDD of 1TB. All those HDD and SSD are in NTFS file system. \nI saw on various forums that there could be problems transfering NTFS files on a Ext3 HDD. \nMy question is, is it better for me to  let the NTFS format on all my HDD (except for the SSD because I will install KUbuntu on it) or to transfer all my data to Ext3 HDD (but with a method that will not produce corrupting files and other problems)?\nThanks for your attention. \n\nA: There is absolutely no problem transferring data from NTFS to ext3. There is an open-source ext driver available that you can install on Windows. This ext driver for Windows is, in my experience, better trustworthy than the NTFS drivers in Linux, meaning that I've seen less problems with it.\nSo what you do, is clean up one of your drives, format it in EXT3 and start moving your files over. You then continue to move stuff around until you are only left with EXT partitions.\nWith those volumes of drives, I'm sure it's a bit of a puzzle but I assume you will be able to create enough space for this process.\nNote that this is NEVER a safe option, even if you'd transfer from NTFS to NTFS, if you don't have a backup of the data. You should always have a backup for the data you can't afford to lose.\nTo me personally, everything I cannot (easily) recreate or download again, is important data that needs to be backed up. Everything that I can download again, is not worth backing up and most of the time, not even worth the money to buy a big disk for.\n", "Q: How to remember which network connection to use?

Is it using the superspeed Installed ubuntu 12.04 with persistence using  unetbootin on a usb 3.0 pen drive. Now booting from it..\nI am not asking if ubuntu supports usb 3.0 . It does\nI am asking if it is connected at Superspeed or just at usb 2.0 speeds ? Is there anything I can do to verify that it is actually running at usb 3.0 speeds ? That is my question. \nThe reason for doubt is that windows sometimes shows \"connected @ usb 3.0 \" and sometimes \"this device can do faster at usb 3.0\"\nI do have the blue usb 3.0 ports. \n\nA: a simple test:\nUSB 2.0 is defined as a technologie which can transport data from a to b with a speed up to 60 Megabytes per second. (We are talking about Megabytes, not Megabits.) But You will seldom find an USB 2.0 device that needs this speed and never find an USB 2.0 pen drive that can reach this speed.\nSo make the following test:\nJust take some big files like movies or so and copy them from your pen drive to your computer hard drive. You should take more than 1 Gigabytes. Before starting, you check how big your package of files is. Then you start and observe the seconds on your watch.\nWhen it is finished, you can calculate how much Megabytes per second this operation has reached.\nWhen it is more than 60 MB/s you can be sure that USB 3.0 is supported.\nA good 3.0 pen drive should make 100 MB/s or more in this test.\n(In this direction)\nBe careful:\nCopying the files from the hard drive to the pen drive will normally take more time than the other direction. \"Reading\" from the pen drive can be more than twice as fast as \"Writing\" on the pen drive.\nThe \"reading\" speed of your hard drive should normally be much faster than the \"writing\" speed of your pen drive. So the copying of data from hard drive to pen drive can show you the writing speed limit of your pen drive.\nBut a good 3.0 pen drive reading speed can be faster than a hard drive writing speed.  \nWhen the \"reading\" speed of your pen drive is faster than the \"writing\" speed of your hard drive, this simple test can not show you the reading speed limit of your pen drive.\nAn other problem: The NTFS file system, which is normally used on Microsoft Windows computers can be a brake for linux operating systems. Copying files from a NTFS drive to an other NTFS drive with a linux operating system can take twice as much time as copying exactly the same files from a linux ext4 drive to an other ext4 drive.\nHave fun on testing\nUlrik\n", "Q: Just before login-screen, a messages flashes by - how can I slow it down to read it?

You can add this to grub file:\nEdit your grub.cfg and change\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nolapic\"\n\nSave file, then run update-grub.\n\nA: Modifying the following lines in my /etc/default/grub file has solved the problem:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi=nomsi quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"tpm_tis.interrupts=0\"\n\n\nA: tpm is compiled into the stock Ubuntu kernel, so there is no way to disable it completely with a boot parameter or by blacklisting.\nTo resolve this issue on a Vaio SZ3 with Linux Mint 17 (based on Ubuntu), I had rebuild the kernel with tpm disabled, as follows:\nFollow BuildYourOwnKernel for the basic process, with the following additions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the menuconfig step as described in 'Modifying the configuration'. Select Y to edit the 'i386 generic' or 'amd64 generic' configuration (N to all others). Once in menuconfig, use the / command to search for CONFIG_IMA, press 1 (or whichever number is indicated) to navigate to it, and N to disable it. Do the same for CONFIG_TPM. I also disabled CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO to reduce the disk space required for the build.\n\n*Before building, touch debian.master/abi/i386/ignore (or amd64) to disable the ABI checks, which would fail due to missing TPM and changed hashes (if you disable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO like me).\n\n*Before installing the .debs that are built, you may need to sudo apt-get install linux-tools-$(uname -r) linux-tools-common\nBear in mind that you'll need to prevent the kernel being automatically updated in future, or go through this process again with the new version.\n\nA: I've run into the same thing and this fix worked like a charm\n# edit /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash tpm_tis.force=1\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 print screen button does not work I'm unable to use my print screen button in Ubuntu 14.04. No effect pressing print screen. Screen-shot application works if it's launched manually.\nPS: Still does not work perfectly neither in 15.04\n\nA: If the print button randomly stops working, please ensure that the previous print screen dialog box is actually closed first. The print button will not work until then(seems apparent but can happen if you are jumping back in forth between applications a lot).\n\nA: My PRTSC button also didn't work for a brief moment, and I haven't figured out what caused it, as after reboot it started working again; however what i can offer is a workaround - you could set an alternative shortcut to taking screenshot\nThe default program to take screenshots in Ubuntu is, as you may now, gnome-screenshot . You could open System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, and under custom shortcuts press plus button.\nA menu such as bellow will appear, where you can enter description and actual command to run.\n\nIn the name field enter the description. In the Command field, well, enter the command. In my example, I've linked gnome-screenshot -w, which is \"take screenshot of current window\". For more information on gnome-screenshot options, refer to man page (man gnome-terminal).\nNow after you have entered name and command, press apply, and you will see this custom shortcut be added to your list. Click on the \"Disabled\", and the text should change to \"New accellerator\". This is where you set a new shortcut, for instance Super+Shift+P.\nAmong other things, you could try resetting  settings for keyboard to default as shown in this post, but I believe it's a bit to extreme step for such simple problem.\nI've also found that for some folks changing kernel.sysrq in /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf helped, but I believe it to be unrelated; with PRTSC button inactive and active, that value was the same , 176.\n\nA: I thought I had the same problem on Ubuntu but turns out all screenshots are stored in home/pictures.\nIt's not like on Windows where you make screenshot then open paint to paste it.\n\nA: The reason for the above is your print screen dialog is already opened somewhere. Probably you pressed print screen and the dialog of save screenshot is minimized or still open. Try closing the dialog and then use the print screen again.\nI wondered if the print screen actually worked. I opened Pinta and pasted my screen shot and it displayed an error saying, the Image cannot be pasted. One of the reason could be your print screen is not working and the other one could be that you don't have and image in your clipboard.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\nPinta is just like MS Paint in Linux. You can download it fro the software centre.\n\nA: Having an error window open (related to some faulty screen resolution) caused this issue for me.\nSimply closing it solved the problem. \nThe strange part was that it wasn't a print screen dialog box.\n\nA: This happens due to permission of /home/<user>/Pictures/ is changed\nYou can simply solve this problem by this command:\n$ sudo chmod -R 777 Pictures\n\nDo this from user HOME folder\n", "Q: Videos streaming with JW Player not working I found recently that any site that streams videos using JW Player that the player gives me a message in my browser saying \"Click here to install Java\".\nI confirmed that I do have IcedTea-web Plugin installed and I went to a java testing site here: http://javatester.org/version.html and it shows that I have it installed.  But I still keep getting the message that I need to install Java on a site that streams a video using JW Player.  This just started happening a few days ago.\n\nA: Not all Java implementations are the same (thank god for universal standards, right?). There are many different versions of Java that you can install on your system and every version really is different.\nYour best luck to get it working, is to install Java from Oracle. There are many links online to show you how to do this (e.g. http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux). Should this link not work, just google \"Oracle java ubuntu\" and you'll get proper working links.\nPlease follow the instructions carefully.\n", "Q: Adding parameters to an \"Open With\" application I can tell the file browser what application to open when I double-click a document, but can I also tell it what command line options to always use when opening that kind of document?\n\nA: Yes, you can. By editing desktop application file (application/x-desktop) especially the Exec field.\nYou can start by choosing, for example, nautilus.desktop to be edited. Your desktop file usually located on /usr/share/applications/. Find the one you want to edit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and type up : \ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\n\n*Open the file with gedit through terminal :\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\n\n*Find Exec field and change the argument as you want. For example : \n...\nExec=nautilus --no-default-window --new-window %U\n...\n\n\n*Save it. Done.\n", "Q: Bring gvim forward when I open a new tab from the command line I like my vi command to open the file in Gvim and to open it in a new tab if Gvim is already running.\nfunction vi {\n    if [[ -z $@ ]]; then\n        gvim \n    elif [[ ${1:0:1} = - ]]; then\n        gvim \"$@\"\n    else\n        gvim --remote-tab-silent \"$@\"\n    fi\n}\n\nThis works, but when I specify a filename and it opens in an existing Gvim instance, it doesn't bring the window to the front like it does on Mac or Windows.\nHow can I make it so that when I enter a \"vi file.txt\" command in the terminal, it will make Gvim the active window?\n\nA: Well, a bit dirty, it can be done using xdotool.\nAdd this to your script : \n    xdotool windowfocus `xdotool search --name \"/* - GVIM\"` && xdotool windowraise `xdotool search --name \"/* - GVIM\"`\n\nIt search a window named \"[Something] - GVIM\" and raising it. Maybe, you can select the window with more specific title using filename and regex for example.\n    xdotool windowfocus `xdotool search --name \"^$filename\\s\\+\\s\\(~\\)\\s-\\sGVIM\"` && xdotool windowraise `xdotool search --name \"^$filename\\s\\+\\s\\(~\\)\\s-\\sGVIM\"`\n\nBut, xdotool is must be downloaded first from apt-get. Type sudo apt-get install xdotool on terminal.\n\nA: I use xdotool too. Such a simple script helps:\n#!/bin/bash\ngvim -p --remote-tab $@ ; xdotool search --name \"/* - GVIM\" windowactivate\n\n", "Q: \"This account is currently not available\" error when trying to ssh An error occurs when I try to make SSH connection:\n$ ssh -p 22 www-data@x.x.x.x \nThis account is currently not available\n\n\nA: You're getting the This account is currently not available. error because the shell for the user www-data is set to /usr/sbin/nologin, and it's set for a very good reason. You should not log in as www-data, it's a special user/group used by the web server, not intended for regular shell use.\nEDIT: It is an especially bad idea to give sudo rights to www-data. If Apache was intended to run with root permissions, it wouldn't have it's own group. By doing this, you are creating huge security holes. You have been warned.\n\nA: While I agree with the others that allowing login through SSH through the www-data user is generally a bad idea, once you've logged in with a normal user it may be useful to run multiple commands concurrently with the permissions set of the www-data user. In that case, one can run\nsudo su -l www-data -s /bin/bash\n\nand you will be able to access your files as the www-data user.\n\nA: The first question I would have to ask is, what are you trying to accomplish by doing this?\nkraxor is 100% correct you should never be able to ssh into your server using your Apache/Nginx user. Doing so invites every hacker with half a brain cell into your server.\nIf you need to run a script or some program as that user you could try sudo -u www-data yourscript or you could temporally chown on the file to a user with login privileges. It's just a vary bad idea to allow this account that kind of access.\n", "Q: Bluetooth mouse not auto-reconnecting to laptop This has been asked, and answered, a million times before.  And I think I've read almost all those questions and answers, and tried as many of the solutions as I can.\nHowever, I still can't get the mouse to automatically reconnect after a sleep, or a shutdown, or any cessation of use.  I'm using a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse under Kubuntu 14.04, 64bit.  I can connect manually, of course.  \nMy latest effort was to add the lines\n<!-- Microsoft Sculpt Comfort mouse -->\n<device oui=\"28:18:78:\" name=\"Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse\" pin=\"0000\"/>    \n\nto /usr/share/kde4/apps/bluedevilwizard/pin-code-database.xml and then restart bluetooth with\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\nBut nothing.  The mouse still has to be manually paired.\nAnd just now, after trying a few hcitool commands - the mouse won't connect at all!  All I now get are timeout messages.  I don't know what I've done, but as of now the mouse refuses to connect at all.\nI'm a bit confused here....\n\nA: It works on Ubuntu 17.10\nI think every distro with bluetoothctl is supported:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run in terminal\nbluetoothctl\nIn $bluetooth command line type devices. You will see list of available devices.\n\n*Type trust 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Where number started with 00: is a divice you wish to connect.\n\n*Type ctrl+d or quit to exit.\n\n*If You want to automatically connect Your device on startup, open Startup Applications and add new one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Add\n\n*Name launcher like My startup BT connection\n\n*In  command type bash -c 'echo -e \"connect 00:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX \\nquit\" | bluetoothctl'\nYou can also setup a keyboard shortcut with same command to lunch, and connect You device with press of a button.\nHave fun :)\n\nA: Try it again but remove this part name=\"Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse\"\nIf it's not that then you probably have the wrong OUI.\nI believe it's the first half of your bluetooth mouse's address.\nOUI stands for Organizational Unique Identifier. Basically the first half of your MAC address says it's made by Microsoft, though mice from the same company may have different OUIs for whatever reason.\nFor this step start from scratch and lets start the process of elimination.\nUninstall/purge blueman-manager or any extra bluetooth software. Go vanilla and just leave the original Ubuntu bluetooth software to rule out any conflicts.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Press the bluetooth mouse's discovery mode.\n\n*Open a terminal and type the command hcitool scan\n\n*Then paste the first half of your bluetooth address as the OUI.\nMake sure to include the last colon like so oui=\"xx:xx:xx:\"\nSo if your bluetooth mouse's address is AB:CD:EF:GH:IJ:KL\nIt would look like this:\n<device oui=\"AB:CD:EF:\" type=\"mouse\" name=\"Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse\" pin=\"0000\"/>\n\nInsert that line with the rest of the entries in\n/usr/share/gnome-bluetooth/pin-code-database.xml\n\nIMPORTANT: Insert at the beginning of the file, just below the starting \n  <devices>\ntag - because the entries match in the order of appearance!\nI'd restart after this just to make sure everything's in order.\nThis should solve most reconnection issues because Ubuntu doesn't know or store the PIN # when you pair the first time when it tries to reconnect.\nNOTE: In other Linux distros, the path of the file pin-code-database.xml may be different!\n\nA: Try to use different tool to pair your Bluetooth device, e.g. blueman-manager (probably Bluetooth device is not \"trusted\").\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and have Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse.\nWhen pairing mouse in Ubuntu's Bluetooth settings dialog, mouse doesn't reconnect after suspend/resume and even after some time of idle.\nI unpaired mouse, paired and \"trusted\" it in blueman-manager and now it works like a charm.\n\nA: I am sure if you are pairing your mouse incorrectly it wont work. I was having the exact same issue. My Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse paired fine and then I left the computer for the day. The screensaver came on and a few hours later I came back to use my computer and my mouse was not working. I probably paired it incorrectly the first time as well. So, I searched through the internet and tried multiple things from the Ubuntu community including removing and repairing my mouse at which point it would not repair. I figured out that I was not actually pairing it correctly each time I paired. The correct steps to pair this mouse that worked are below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Bluetooth manager (should work with any manager, but I used specifically Bluetooth manager)\n\n*Press and hold down the pairing button on the bottom of the mouse until you get a solid flashing blue light (slowly flashing about 1 flash per second)\n\n*Click search in Bluetooth manager\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse, and then click the key icon (pairing      icon)\n\n*Once the mouse pairs, click the golden star icon within the Bluetooth Manager so the mouse is trusted.\n\n*Now that the mouse is paired and trusted, click setup, choose input service and then click \"forward\". When you see \"Device added and connected successfully\" click close.\n\n\n\nA: None of the answers listed here worked for me, but I paired the device using the commandline tool bluetoothctl and it reconnected automatically. What I did was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the mouse to discoverable\n\n*run bluetoothctl (list the Mac addess of my mouse)\n\n*run pair <MAC> (within bluetoothctl which paired the device)\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with this mouse, and I found the solution using the second approach mentioned here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/177998/bluetooth-mouse-disconnects\nIn short, create a rule file, namely \"99-bluetooth.rules\", in \"/etc/udev/\" and add this line in it:\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"bluetooth\", ATTR{product}==\"Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse        \", ATTR{power/control}=\"on\"\n\nThis solved my issue, I hope it helps you too.\n\nA: Confirmed. Using standard bluetooth packages editing the pin-code-database.xml file also enabled the reconnection of a Lenovo Thinkpad Bluetooth Laser mouse after system reboot.

went into Network Manager and locked in BSSID number in previously blank field. Still, I see the WiFi icon fluctuating.\nBSSID found through running:\ncat /var/log/syslog | grep -e etwork -e wlan | tail -n20\n\nWhich gave me a message:\nWLAN:0 WPA: GROUP\nRekeying completed with ( BSSID NUMBER)\n[GTK=CCMP]\n\nEDIT/FOLLOW UP:\nPer @Wild Man'comment:\nI found the only thing I could or needed to change was \"ignore\" in ipv6.  Following that I ran the commands provided in his answer on the linked thread. After doing so, I was not able to re-connect via wireless until I rebooted, and then it takes a long time to open up start page.

However I was disconnected fully until reboot.\n\nA: Install the dependencies required to compile the driver:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms\n\nClick here to download the newest driver to your computer then right click and extract here.\nThen compile the driver using the directions below.\ncd ~/Downloads/backports-3.16-rc1-1\nmake defconfig-rtlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot\nWhen you have an upgrade to the kernel you will need to do:\ncd ~/Downloads/backports-3.16-rc1-1\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-rtlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot\nThanks to chili555 for finding and testing this driver, the driver compiled on two different computers.\n", "Q: How do I start a program later if I unlock it from the Launcher on the left? I'm a newbie from Windows XP. In WinXP if I deleted a program's icon from the desktop I could always find and start the program later from the Start>Programs menu. Is there an equivalent in Ubuntu?\n14.04 is so far just wonderful. Will be great when someone gets Flash to work as it should and a few other things.\n\nA: Yep, press the windows key (called Super) and then search for the program name. What you opened is called the Dash, to get it you can also click on the icon at the top of your launcher.\nHave a look at this website, on migrating from windows. If you need, you could install lubuntu or xubuntu which are versions of Ubuntu that looks similar to XP.\n", "Q: Thunderbird opens HTTPS links in Chromium, instead of default browser I've set the following data in Thunderbird's config editor:\nnetwork.protocol-handler.app.http;x-www-browser\nnetwork.protocol-handler.app.https;x-www-browser\n\nAs soon as I did this, http: links are opened with x-www-browser (which currently links Google Chrome), but https: links are still opened in my old default browser, Chromium.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Launch Thunderbird.\n\n\n*Click on the menu button.\n\n\n\n*Click on Preferences.\n\n\n\n*Again click on Preferences.\n\n\n\n*Then goto the Advanced tab.\n\n\n\n*Click on Config Editor.\n\n\n\n*Pass through the Warranty by clicking \"I'll be careful, I promise!\".\n\n\n\n*Then search for \"network.protocol-handler.warn-external.http\".

Currently using a Huawei USB dongle which works perfectly out of the box with 14.04. Only thing I need now is a linux version of the GUI which enables users to send messages, make calls et al. Anything like that out there? \n\nA: An excellent tool I was directed to helps in managing the Modem Manager GUI Modem Manager GUI is frontend for ModemManager daemon able to control specific modem functions. The main features listed on the project website are: \n\n\n*\n\n*GTK3 interface\n\n*Send and receive SMS messages with messages concatenation\n\n*Send USSD request and receive answer in system encoding\n\n*Get modem and SIM information (Device info, Operator name, Mode, IMEI, IMSI/ESN, Signal level)\n\n*Scan available mobile networks\nControl data transmission process and set session traffic and time limits\n\n\nUSSD requests works perfectly. Can send and receive SMS but it seems the messages don't get saved on the sim but only displays via Notify-OSD\nFinally as noted already in this question, the call function doesn't work with this tool. To get this function working again, wammu and gammu packages from this PPA should be added by running the following commands: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nijel/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wammu gammu \n\nNOTE: Not all dongles are supported. Here is a list of all the Huawei dongles supported along with the supported feature \n", "Q: What is the current status of support for optimus graphics cards? I will make a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 on my machine in a bit.\nWill I have to install optimus / will the system auto-install it / is there a better option than optimus available at this time?\n\nA: Optimus is supported in Ubuntu and will work when you install the closed source NVIDIA drivers. You'll have a tab (PRIME profiles) in the Nvidia settings screen where you can switch between the Intel or Nvidia card.

When you can give me a solution would greatly appreciate it, I have my tower server with linux (ubuntu 14.04) and I have tried my server ping the pc where I installed a program.

In Windows, you will need to do a ping -t to have a similar effect to the ping command in Linux, i.e. continuous pinging until CTRL-C is pressed.\nIf you are not getting a response from your Windows machine, that means that either the firewall is running and blocking ICMP requests, your network settings are incorrectly configured or there is no network route between your Linux and Windows server (assuming they are physically or wirelessly connected to each other).\n", "Q: Chmod ubuntu desktop fail I accidentally did chmod 667 on /home/user/Desktop/ and now it is behaving strangely.\nHow can I reverse the damage I have done?\n\nA: 755 is standard mode for directories. just\n chmod 755 /home/User/Desktop\n\nand everything will be ok\n\nA: Try chmod -x Desktop, executing it from ~ ( your home folder).\n", "Q: How do I mount a blank cd in Xubuntu?

I always get text/plain or application/octet-stream when running \"mimetype\" on all file types. \nThe command \"file --mime-type\" seems to identify correctly the different file types. For instance, if I run it on a PDF file, I get \n\nfilename.pdf: application/pdf\n\nBut if I try to run \"mimetype\" on the same PDF file, I get\n\nfilename.pdf: text/plain\n\nSimilarly, if I run \"file --mime-type\" on a mp3 file, I get\n\nfilename.mp3: audio/mpeg\n\nBut if I try to run \"mimetype\" on the same mp3 file, I get\n\nfilename.mp3: application/octet-stream\n\nAs a consequence, I cannot open some files with the suitable application. For example. I cannot open a PDF file with evince. And I cannot set the \"Open with\" option of Nautilus to open each file-format with the suitable application. \nI have tried to run sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime but it does not fix the problem.\nI have noticed that, if I run \"mimetype\" as the first user, I get this message\n\nWARNING: You don't seem to have a mime-info database. The shared-mime-info package is available from http://freedesktop.org/ \n\nHowever the shared-mime-info package seems to be correctly installed.\n\nA: The problem was solved reinstalling the shared-mime-info package, as suggested by  Glutanimate, with\n\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall shared-mime-info\n\n", "Q: /etc/network/interfaces file empty I don't know what I did but my network manager doesn't start up and my wifi doesn't work unless I do it all manually.  I've read that I need to edit /etc/network/interfaces file but when I look for it, only the interfaces.bak file exists.\nSo I type sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces and it opens but it's blank.

I have a boot repair disk for Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm about to install Ubuntu 14.04 but I'd like to make sure that I have the latest boot repair disk before doing so.  Where can I download the most recent boot repair disk?\n\nA: The boot-repair-disk can be downloaded from the sourceforge.net website at this link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/?source=recommended\nMost recent computers need the 64-bit version of the boot-repair-disk. For repairing 32-bit Linux operating systems with boot-repair-disk you need the 32-bit one.\nThe RSS feed that has update notifications about the latest version of boot-repair-disk is at this link: http://sourceforge.net/api/file/index/project-id/578971/mtime/desc/limit/20/rss\n", "Q: Cannot find Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu Is there a solution to this?\nGparted gives me \nThanks a lot.\nBest Regards.\n\nA: If the Ubuntu don't suggest to mount an NTFS partition, I am afraid the installation was delete your windows. If you have a back up for your windows, it time to use it.\n\nA: When you installed Ubuntu, you selected to use the whole disk instead of installing it besides your Windows installation. Some people don't see this option for various reasons, so always be careful with what you do and understand what options you select before you proceed.\nYou are now left with unpartitioned space so you are safe to install Windows. Just boot your pc from your Windows installation media (CD/DVD/USB/Network/...) and use the unpartitioned space as Windows will suggest.\nAfter the installation, you will immediately boot into your Windows and initially be unable to boot Ubuntu because Windows will overwrite your MBR and use its own boatloader that initially, doesn't see Ubuntu.\nYou then have the option to customize the Windows bootloader or re-install GRUB2 as bootloader so you can choose to boot Windows or Ubuntu. There are several threads on stackexchange explaining how to do both.\n", "Q: data error in boot\\grub ... file broken So I am trying to make my usb stick bootable and load ubuntu 14.04 64 bit on it.\nI have tried different methods,\nfor example, I format my usb on windows to be FAT32 and then am using the Universal USB installer loading iso file into it. However, I am getting 192 errors ! which most of the look like Data error in boot\\grub\\x86_64-efi*.mod. File is broken.\nI also have boot the usb stick in different format, but still no success.

I was told that 12.04 is very obsolete version. so I deleted (literally Ctrl+Shift+Del) Ubuntu directory and downloaded and installed Ubuntu 14.04. Now the problem is when I start the computer, I see a prompt whether I want to boot in Windows or Ubuntu, but when I select Ubuntu it shows some error message - obviously since I have deleted the files. But I am not able to see the prompt for Ubuntu 14.04.\nPlease help. If you need more information regarding this I'll give it in comments.\n\nA: Short:\nForget about Wubi, restore Windows bootloader, prepare partitions and install Ubuntu 14.04 in a normal way.\nDetailed:\nBoot from Windows 7 DVD and after choosing language options, start the console:\nRepair your computer -> Use recovery tools... -> Command prompt. In the\nconsole run the following commands to re-install Windows bootloader:\nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nReboot and that's it! Now You should have only normal Windows bootloader, no mess after Wubi.\nThen prepare partitions for Ubuntu. You can shrink Windows NTFS partition under Windows and let the Ubuntu installer use free space, or you can let the installer handle whole process for you. It is wide topic, but is is not very complicated, so there is nothing to worry about. There is no reason to re-write official Ubuntu documentation here, just read and follow Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and everything will be clear and easy.\n", "Q: Is there a login theme like mac for my ubuntu 12.04 LTS? I have ubuntu 12.04 lts and I just want a link to a website which has this kind of login theme for ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Yes, from this google search I found this video and then this github page with good instructions.\nPlease do research before asking here.\nAlso, this might help, as might this.\nHowever, if you want it identical, why not buy a mac? They're different OSs, and while Ubuntu/Linux is highly customisable, there are some things it isn't built for. The login screen looks nice as it is, and works. Do you have a specific reason for requiring it look identical to a mac?\n", "Q: Cant mark minecaft as executeable in xubuntu 14.04 I cant mark minecraft as executeable, I try rightclicking minecraft and starting it up with java 7, but i need to mark it as executeable, If i go to \"properties\" and go to \"Permissions\" it does not have a checkbox where i can mark it, I have tried doing the command: \"chmod a+x minecraft.jar\" but it just says: \"chmod: cannot access ‘minecraft.jar’: No such file or directory\" How to i mark it?\n\nA: It's very easy.

I guess this should be extremely easy as in Windows OS :) However, I have no idea how to do it in Ubuntu 14.04.\nIs there anything I can do to create a simple folder shortcut on my desktop?\n\nA: I wasn't able to file a reliable solution from the other provided answers. As such, I'm sharing my preferred approach to creating a desktop shortcut.\nDesktop shortcuts can be added by creating a file with the .desktop extension in the ~/Desktop/ folder using any text editor. The .desktop file we create shall launch the folder viewer app xdg-open at the location specified by [folder-path].\nThough it's not necessary, it is of course sensible to name the file similarly to the folder name.\nThe following information should be written to ~/Desktop/[file-name].desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=[folder-name]\nExec=xdg-open [folder-path]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=[icon-path]\n\nReplacing [folder-name] with the name of the folder and [folder-path] with the location of the folder.\nPlease Note: If the location or name of the folder changes then the .desktop entry will require to be edited.\nOnce the file has been created it shall appear on the desktop. Right click it and click Allow Launching to activate the .desktop file as an application.\nYou can replace [icon-path] with an image of your choice; Default Ubuntu icons are located at: /usr/share/icons/.\nExamples of default Ubuntu folder icons include (but are not limited to):\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/icons/Yaru/48x48/places/folder.png\n\n*/usr/share/icons/Humanity/places/48/folder.svg\n\n*/usr/share/icons/HighContrast/48x48/folder.png\nFor more information on the Desktop Entry Specification please see:\nhttps://developer.gnome.org/desktop-entry-spec/\nNote that as our file is launching xdg-open it is proper to use the .desktop extension, rather than the .directory extension.\n\nA: Apparently this is handled correctly from the GUI :-)  (14.04 LTS)\n(Move to Trash, Empty Trash)\nBut generally: When you have a link to a directory, be VERY sure to delete ONLY the link should/when you come to that point.\nFrom terminal, the correct thing to do is:\n\nrm LINK-TO-DIR\n\n\nBUT NOT:\n\nrm -r LINK-TO-DIR\n\n... which will first delete the files/dirs that the link MAKES VISIBLE,\nand even more so with the \"-f\" flag.\n\nIf you are a \"Terminal\" user, have a look on the output of\n\nln --help\n\n... that ls lover case of LN nothing else ;-)\nThe syntax for it may seem a tad \"backwards\" at first as you FIRST specify where it should point, then the name of your LINK.\n\ncd $HOME/Desktop\nmkdir -p $HOME/z\nln -s $HOME/z New-Link-To-Home-z\n\n... note that the GUI will not notice the new Desktop content without help; you need to logout+login.\nMore info on the 'net or slightly terse in either of\n\nman ln\ninfo ln\n\n... where I personally prefer the first because 'info' has a tendency to 'slip out of context'.\n\nA: Click on that folder, click on make link, then move the shortcut to Desktop.\n\nA: You can read full details here \nman ln\n\nln -s /usr/bin/bar /opt/foo\n\nalso see this link \nCreate a soft or symbolic link \n\nA: it simple: just press Ctrl + Shift and drag.\n\nA: Basically there are two options and both of them work with Ubuntu 22.04 and probably previous releases too, \nYou can create a link to your Dropbox folder by running this command in terminal \nln -s <path_to_reference_folder> <path_where_you_want_your_link_to_be_placed>\n\nYou can also do it through pressing Ctrl+Shift+M after selecting the folder you want a shortcut of, it will create a link to that folder in the reference folder's parent folder, then you can press Ctrl+Shift and drag the link_to_your_folder to desktop or wherever you want that to be placed. \n\nNote: Just doing Ctrl+Shift and drag, as some people suggested here, won't create a shortcut of your folder instead it would move your folder to desktop which you probably don't want to do as this isn't the way shortcuts work in Windows.\n\nHave a Nice Day...!\n\nA: Sorry I'm so late to the conversation but if you are trying to navigate to a folder or run any common command with ease you want to create aliases. First you need to open the alias editor.\nsudo nano -Bu ~/.bashrc\n\ngo all the way to the bottom of the opened document and add the following\n#My aliases\nalias aliasname='command you want issued here'\n\nin my editor I added these 2 lines to make it easier to access and edit my aliases.\nalias makealias='sudo nano -Bu ~/.bashrc'\nalias refreshalias='. ~/.bashrc'\n\nafter your aliases have been created issue the refreshalias command I made\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nnow test your alias by entering your keyword and see if it creates correctly.\nSomething that surprised me the first time I did this was the fact that 3 common file directory tools taught to me in school ll, la, and l were all aliases of ls extentions in this same tool.\nalias ll='ls -alF'\nalias la='ls -A'\nalias l='ls -CF'\n\nas a note to me I also created an aliaslist.txt file on my home with every alias I made with a description after it. Have fun building aliases hope they help you as much as they help me.\n\nA: This works for me -r option to make the shortcut relative to its source. Without it, you may have error as\n\nThe link \"shortcut-name\" is broken\n\nln -rs /path/to/create/shortcut-name /path/to/the/source\n\n\nA: These below command will create file or folder shortcut in your working directory, in this case it's Desktop/.\ncd Desktop/\nln -s /path/to/source/file-or-folder\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu server LVM mapper problem at boot when plugged a second hard drive I installed ubuntu 14.04LTS server version.

It is connected to a router which is also a DHCP server. After a couple of days, the static address is dropped and replaced by a DHCP address. Why would that be? \n\n\n*\n\n*If I do a sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 or sudo service networking restart or a reboot, the\nsystem takes on its static address again, but then a couple of days\nlater, the IP address changes to a dynamic one. \n\n*There is no other\nsystem on the network with (accidentally) the same static address.\n\n*NetworkManager is not running on the system.\n\n*I have set up the system to email me as soon as the address changes, but the times at which that occurs seem completely random. DHCP Lease time is 24h but that doesn't seem to\ncorrelate, and anyway that shouldn't matter for a static address.\n\n*My /etc/network/interfaces is this:\n\n\n\n    auto lo\n    iface lo inet loopback\n    auto eth0\n    iface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.124.104\n    gateway 192.168.124.253\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nIt's a bit of a puzzle.\nWhat would cause a system to give up its static address and request a DHCP address instead? What to look for, in which log file?\n\nA: Recently I stumbled on this problem and after some investigation it turned out that /etc/dhcp/dhcp.conf needed a block to be added, (or uncommented,) similar to this: \n\n\nalias {   interface \"eth0\";   \nfixed-address 10.1.1.1;   \noption subnet-mask 255.0.0.0; }\n\n\nHope this helps!\nRegards,   Glendon Gross\n\nA: Hmmm, strange... I'm not sure it matters, but for neatness sake I would place the netmask parameter directly after \"address\" and not after \"gateway\". You should also uninstall/deactivate the (isc-)dhcp-client package from the host, and beware of ipv6 and the resolveconf package. Before that: A way to find out what's going on is to put in place a firewall rule that accepts & logs all traffic to and from the DHCP ports (server 67 UDP and client 68 UDP) or create logging for the devices state, the dhcp-client or sniff your traffic.  \nA workaround (or alternative solution) though is to configure DHCP reservations for some of your hosts or an infinite lease-time for their DHCP addresses. For me that works really well, and the advantage is centralized management. If your DHCP server is your modem/router you can probably configure it in the web-interface (either the lease-time or the reservation) and on some routers you can even check a \"fixed address\" checkbox. If you configured your own server (Ubuntu?) you need to edit the dhcpd.conf file adding some lines like this:\nhost Accountant {\n  hardware ethernet 00:1F:6A:XX:XX:XX;\n  fixed-address 192.168.124.104;\n}\n\n\nA: I know this is old, but I ran into a similar issue that I was struggling with. I also opened a case with Canonical to ask for help.\nI've since resolved my issue and have come back to this post in the hope that this might prove useful to someone else who might stumble upon this.\nMy issue in the end, turned out to be 'wicd-daemon'. I'm not sure how or why the package was installed, but it was the main contributor of dropping my static address and causing other networking issues for me.\nA symptom of my problem was dhclient would startup if I unplugged the network cable and plugged it back in. Similar to the issue reported here I would then get a different IP address. If I set my NIC manually it was OK, but then some random time later it would get a different IP (due to dhclient running in the background it seems). Check if dhclient is running. As for why dhclient is even running that is another problem. Below I describe what resolved dhclient for me, which I ended up tracing down several paths (avahi, ntpd, ifup, ...). For my case it was wicd-daemon.\nThe issue originally came to light in testing as I was switching networks that required me to physically move my network cable. This caused networking issue for me which it shouldn't have. It also took a bit of time to discover the problem as well, as I was not expected my static IP to have dropped or changed.\nIn the end, purging wicd-daemon and python-wicd took care of the issue. My system now retains the static IP address even when the network cable has been unplugged. I've not seen dhclient start up either, so I'm thinking that issue has also resolved itself. I went down other paths as well, looking at avahi which seemed to play a roll in the issues I was having, I also looked at ntpd as well (weird I know, but it was showing up in the syslogs at the same time other issues did; NTPD probably didn't have anything to do with it but it was producing suspicious logs). I ran down several rabbit holes until by chance I stumbled on a wicd process running while doing other testing.\nSo long story short check if dhclient is running and if you have a network manager like wicd running on your system. It could be what is causing you problems with your static address.\n\nA: Just wanted to add that if you have multiple interfaces, make sure you define the right interface in your /etc/network/interfaces file.\nFor me, the issue was that auto lo was defined at the beginning of the file.\nBut actually instead of that there needed to be auto eth0.\nOnce defined correctly, my static IP is kept on reboot.\nHopes this helps someone.\n", "Q: is there some way to make windows owned by root (sudo) look different from normal user ones?

Suppose that I want to execute the command ls ten times (despite of it being purposeless since it will only display the directory contents 10 times), is there an equivalent to writing the following: \nfor (i = 0, i < 10, i++) {\n\n     ls\n\n}\n\nNow, suppose that I want to execute a Java program ten times, each time with a different input file. Is there an equivalent to writing the following:\nfileList = [input1, input2, ....., input10]\n\nfor (i = 0, i < 10, i++) {\n\n     java myProgram fileList[i]\n\n}\n\nI am guessing that there is some sort of language where I could write this kind of scripts. I tried looking online but my knowledge is basic and I could not find anything that I understood.\n\nA: Yes there is! You can use BASH which is interpreting the commands you type into your terminal.\nFor example, try this:\nfor file in {input1,input2,input3}; do java myprogram $file; done\n\nThis one-liner is a simple loop which will run myprogram with java on the list of files.\nThis is 100% equivalent to running:\njava myprogram input1\njava myprogram input2\njava myprogram input3\n\nYou can use this syntax with any command you like. For example, you can list all files in your home directory with:\nfor file in ~/*; do echo $file; done\n\n~/* will expand into a list of all files within ~ directory (except for the hidden files).\nAnother example: if you wanted to run your program on 100 files, you do not need to list them by hand. Try this:\n for i in $(seq 1 100); do java myprogram input$i; done;\n\n$(seq 1 100) will expand into the output of seq 1 100 command, which provides a list of numbers from 1 to 100. This way your program will be run on all 100 \"inputN\" files.\nIt is also fine to use multiple command within the loop, but then it becomes much more convenient to use multiple lines. The following example will run your program on 10 test inputs and will print differences from reference outputs:\nfor i in $(seq 1 10); do\n    java myprogram input$i > temp_out\n    diff temp_out output$i\ndone\n\nAs your script grows, it will soon become convenient to save it to a file. Write down your script (typically bash scripts will have .sh extension), and run it with:\nsh myscript.sh\n\nor, if you set +x flag on myscript file, and placed #!\\bin\\sh at the top of your script (which states that this file should be run with bash):\n./myscript.sh\n\n\nA: This language is the very program where you're tying the command.\nThe command line prompt is provided by a shell. Ubuntu's default shell is Bash (you should start with tutorials and consult the manual for reference).\nTo execute multiple related commands successively, you can use a loop. You can store a list of file names in an array variable.\nfile_list=(input1 input2 … input10)\nfor file in \"${file_list[@]}\"; do\n  java myProgram \"$file\"\ndone\n\nThe syntax elements I've used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Array variable assignment: variable=(element1 element2 element3) (no spaces around =)\n\n*Using an array variable: \"${variable[@]}\" (yes, it's weird, for historical reasons)\n\n*Using a string variable: \"$variable\"\n\n*For loop: for variable in list; do instructions; done (; is equivalent to a newline)\n\n", "Q: 5th partition without format I have a 500gb hdd with 4 primary partitions: sda1: ubuntu, sda2: swap (2gb), sda3: win8.1, sda4: logical (sda5 & sda6) storage.\nwhile creating all these partitions, i inadvertently left 7gb unallocated (adjacent to sda3) now i want to create a backup partition (probably bootable,don't know) to use with the dell backup utility but can't since i already have 4 primary partitions :/\ni thought about removing the swap partition as i have 4gb of ram, but i read thousands of threads and i'm still lost.\nis there a way that i can create such a partition without loosing any data? btw, if someone could tell me how, it would be very kind.\n\nA: You could extend your logical partition to include that free space, then create a new partition there, if the space is between sda3 and sda4. If not, then just move sda3 so the free space is adjacent to sda4. Moving partitions can take a lot of time, up to several hours.\nIt's a relatively easy operation if you use a live DVD (or USB disk as I prefer) and gparted.\nNote: Removing your swap partition is not recommended, it can ruin your day to run out of memory at some point. The recommended size for swap is at least the same as your RAM, but preferably, twice the size. See the Community Wiki for more details.\n\nA: Since you've stated that your extended partition has 2 logical data only partitions on it, you could always move that\npartition to the left, and then extend it to eat up the 6gb of space. You will then be able to create a 6gb logical\npartition. \nSteps:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal type \"sudo apt-get install gparted\". \n\n*Go to the Unity Dash, and search \"gparted\". Click the Gparted result to run Gparted.\n\n*Right click on the extended partition, and choose \"Resize/Move\".\n\n*Change the \"Free space preceding\" entry to \"0\", and click \"Resize/Move\". [To make the button\nclickable you may need to click into one of the other boxes first, but don't edit them.]\n\n*Click the checkmark at the top of Gparted, and then click \"Apply\" in the prompt to apply the changes.\n\n*When it finishes you can click \"Close\". Gparted will re-scan your devices, and you should now see the\nfree space listed in your extended partition.\n\n*Right click on the free space, and choose \"New\".\n\n*Enter you desired partition paramiters, and click \"Add\". Click the checkmark, and then click \"Apply\" to apply the\nchanges.\n\n*Click \"close\". You now have another partition! :)\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Never move partitions that have an OS on them, or are being used by a program that will expect them to be in\nspecific place unless you know what you're doing as this can have dire concequences like inability to boot and operating system.\n\n*Always backup your entire hard drive (or at least data on the partitions you're modifying) before engaging in any kind\nof disk management activities, because it only takes one error to change your life forever.\nAdditional Resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gparted Manual: http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual\n\n*What disk partitioning is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning\n\n*What Are The Risks Of Partitioning Drives: https://superuser.com/questions/402569/what-are-the-risks-of-partitioning-drives\n\n*Disks, Partitions, Partition-tables, and Filesystems: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7682570/\n", "Q: JACK turns off other sound I have a midi keyboard connected to qSynth through jack, which works fine.

If you want to use an application that does not support JACK natively, you can use PulseAudio as an intermediate layer.

You can simply install it by running:\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nLauch it and you're ready to install and play your game.

This files have an  .js , .php , .sh extensions.They execute in www/html by apache's user(mine is www-data). When I give 777 permission to this file and directories , the others which are the same network can see the file content. This is weak security.I want to make strong security. When I give 644 the some of files can't execute.This permission should make strong security and at the same time it is enough to execute file. Which permission must be  given to directories and files for this state?\n\nA: Files that are served by Apache (i.e. requested via HTTP) don't need executable permissions to be run, they only need to be readable by Apache.\nWhat I usually do is, set the group to www-data and the permissions to 640 for files and 1750 for directories, so no one else can read them besides the web server.\n\nA: I usually use the following permissions under /var/www/virtualhost:\nchown -R www-data:www-data *\nchmod -R 640 *\n\nThis ensures that only the HTTP server can see the files.\nNo execute permission is needed for .js and .php files. Shell scripts (.sh files) probably need them if you want to run them as CGI scripts (I've never tried it, so I don't know how to set it up.\n", "Q: Volume too low after connecting Pulseaudio to JACK I followed the tutorial mentioned here but after the sound is much quieter even at 100%.

I still got the error, so I reinstalled/updated Grub.Then, I saw that all the guides I read had the resolution on the GRUB_GFX line without quotes, so at a last-ditch attempt to fix it, I typed \"gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\", removed the quotes, updated, and restarted. I still get the error \"Input out of range, change to 1366x768 - Refresh rate 60\" when grub loads. Now, grub still works of course, If I hit enter Ubuntu loads, if I arrow down 5 lines and hit enter Windows 7 loads.I only get this error in grub, all the OS GUIs load fine, even the Ubuntu recovery mode terminal.

I forgot to change it before overwriting that partition with Ubuntu, and now my battery in Ubuntu never charges past 59~60%. I think this is due to something in the BIOS because it persists despite my Windows partition being gone. \nI've searched the BIOS but there's no mention of battery anywhere!\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: Since the answer Intruder is a little bit dated and doesn't contain an answer, only the link, the solution he provides is as follows (originally provided by yigit from the lenovo forum):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Laptop.\n\n*Remove the battery and the AC.\n\n*Press the Power-Button for 30-40 seconds.\n\n*Put everything back together and start reboot your laptop.\n\n\nAlso: According to some more sources it doesn't seem to be OS related but more hardware related. As far as I could understand, you are resetting your CMOS with the steps above. It worked for me and my Lenovo E530.\n\nA: For the Lenovo G70-70 the answer is: reinstall Windows and the Lenovo Power Manager.  I tried installing Linux programs that could in principle regulate the charge, but Synaptics returned strange warnings and would not let me install those scripts.  After switching off the offensive setting I installed Linux again (besides Windows this time) and everything is fine.\nThe suggestion by mspl that you could empty the cmos by holding down the power button did not work, either.

It'll usually be /dev/sdb1 but it could be something else if you have more disks attached to your machine.\nAlternatively, you can launch the gparted command from the user interface and go through the disks to see which device is connected to /cdrom\nNow type the command below in the terminal window, being very careful to replace /dev/sdb1 with the device you got from the previous command:\nsyslinux /dev/sdb1\n\nThe last command above overwrites the earlier version of syslinux in the boot sector of your bootable USB device partition with the correct version that matches the distribution itself.\nThat's it! Now reboot and you should be able to go through the normal GUI flow of the Live USB.\nOf course, if you have a bootable Ubuntu media that doesn't have an evaluation option, like the Ubuntu Server installation media, you can't use it to fix itself, but you can use the desktop version to fix the server version with the instructions above. Just plug the server version media into the usb after the desktop version is already booted and use the device for the server version in place of /dev/sdb1 above.\n\nA: As Filip Sohajek mentioned, you need to hit Tab. \nThen you will see a set of options (live, live install, etc). Select the one that you like typing its name and pressing Enter.\n\nA: When I attempted to solve this, I got a few different options, but it worked. Following Filip's answer, I pressed TAB and then a few choices popped up (none of which were \"live\" or anything containing \"live\" but it did say \"Install\", so after typing install and hitting enter it gives you choices for screen resolution, and then will proceed to the installation. So, a bit confusing, but it does work!\n\nA: This doesn't work for me. I get:\nInitramfs unpacked failed: junk in compressed archive.\n(...)\nKernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block(2.0)\n(...)\nI had to adopt a very ugly solution, but it worked like a charm. I went into a friend's office, ask him to let me use one of the computers running Microsoft Windows.

I'd like to install win 7 along with kubuntu.\nCould anyone please tell me how should I partition the HD?\nShall I partition SDA1 or 3?\n\n\nA: I would resize /dev/sda3, and use the newly created partition.  Make sure that you boot from the Ubuntu live/Bootable media, and use gparted to resize that partition.  \nNow from the image I can see that you have labeled /dev/sda3 as Data.  If you like to use the whole partition, I would backup that data, and then use the whole partition.\nWarning:  When dealing with partitions anything can go wrong, so make sure that you have a current backup of all your data.\n\nA: Since you seem to be storing your data and operating systems on separate partitions I would suggest taking space from sda1. I would speculate you may need the data space in the future, but will probably never use all the OS space even with 2 operating systems unless you install lots of large programs (games often being a good example of space eaters). Also by not editing your data partition you reduce the likely hood of loosing it if your shrinking proceedure fails. It boils down to personal preference.\n\n\n*\n\n*To shrink a partition in Gparted right click on it and choose \"Resize/Move\". This will need to be done from a livecd, because you cannot shrink the partition while running Ubuntu on it.\n\n*Change the size to what you want. DO NOT MOVE THE PARTITION THOUGH. Apply the change using the checkmark at the top of Gparted.\n\n*Right click on the free space and choose \"New\". Then create a new partition for Windows (choose NTFS as the format type if you aren't sure what you want). Again click on the checkmark to apply the change.\n", "Q: What does \"LDS\" stand for in the openstack reference implementation?

What is the different between Tmux and Terminator? I currently use Terminator which allows me to add more shell in same screen by splitting them horizontally or vertically.\nI read about them in some articles but I'm still not able to figure out the main difference.\nI want to know what features I'm missing if I don't use Tmux. I'm a front-end developer. I mainly use command line to use git commands only.\n\nA: Terminator is easy to install and it does exactly what it's supposed to do - it can split terminal windows both horizontally and vertically, according to user's requirements. It also allows to keep multiple tabs opened in case splitting one window is not enough. \nTmux lies somewhere between Terminator and screen, combining ease of use with basing on the plain terminal only. \nHere are the advantages of tmux over Terminator:\n\n\n*\n\n*Portability - tmux works on all systems able to handle plain, old\nterminal.\n\n*Scriptability - tmux can be scripted, so that setting up windows and\npanes takes nothing more than one or two keystrokes.\n\n*Server-client architecture - tmux can be used to share sessions\nbetween users.\n\n*Tweaks and options - both tmux and Terminator are easy to get with,\nbut it's tmux that allows to go further and offers wide range of\nconfiguration hacks.1\n1Source: Łukasz Wróbel\n\nA: Been a user of both Terminator/Tmux (and screen, however, have given it up now).\nI am dependent on Tmux more because I cannot rely on X. Most of the time I SSHing to remote VM and coding/debugging there. These are linux VM instances in multi-user text-mode runlevel thus terminator is out of the question.\nOther reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tmux allows me to connect to a previously detached session.\n\n*Sometimes I need to duplicate my session to a remote person sitting in another part of the world. Tmux allows me to duplicate my session (without needing to share my desktop). The remote person simply needs to attach to my tmux session.\n\n*Tmux allows vim integration\n\n*Tmux is highly scriptable i.e., I can open up my test-setup using a single script and provide windowed access to different virtual machines.\n\n\nTerminator has a great UI and more user-friendly since it also integrates well with the mouse. But it is fundamentally dependent on X, which is a hurdle for my adoption.\nI used screen for a few years but then moved to tmux because of its flexibility and never looked back.\n\nA: To add up with all the answers said about the question. I have been a user of both Terminator and Tmux, but right this moment I switched to tmux in xterm. My experience has been great over the decision because ;\nIn tmux i can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Predefine layouts, and with these layouts I can use attach commands which will run in each specified pane and then attach some key bindings to activate some predefined layout.\n\n*Reassign the default key bindings (as said, it's scriptable) so I can make my vim key bindings and make the experience even better.\n\n*Some learning experience from zooming, copying to and from the clipboard, to configuring your terminal colors and more.\n\n*Customizing the look and feel is in your hands. Using scripts and third party scripts you can customize tmux to look like and entreprise IDE ie. (powerline, screen sharing and predefined layouts as said above).\n\n*Screen Sharing FTW, Say you work with multi workspaces and have multiple terminals open in different workspaces but there is a tmux window in workspace 1 and you need that window to be available everywhere, with tmux link-window you can have that window available in all your workspaces and it's awesome!\nDid i also say tmux is a Terminal multiplexer and not a Terminal emulator like Terminator, xterm, termite, urxvt etc?\nThis is important to Note because then you can use different terminal emulators and stil share the same tmux windows in emulators you prefer to use.\nThe experience is so creative, and you can also check this guy called \nGotbletu on YouTube he has lots of tutorials on tmux.\nHere is an image of my code layout, which I only have to press (Ctlr + a  -- as the modified mod key) and alt + c to get it starting.\n\n\nA: Terminator is a terminal emulator.  It \"emulates\" a display terminal inside your X-Windows display system.  Terminator specifically is very cool, because it allows you to split windows, configure layouts, assign keybindings, etc...\nTmux is a \"multi-plexer\".  It's slightly different in that it allows you to run a persistent session inside a terminal.  So Tmux allows you to do things like open a session at work, shut down your laptop, go home, then reopen your laptop and drop right back into that same running session. \nCurrently, I'm exploring Terminator, but I use both.  For instance, I might have a Tmux session running multiple panes on one server in one Terminator pane.  In another Terminator pane, I might have an ssh session running on another server. \n", "Q: .pigbootup not found I have a problem trying to get this command to run.\nI've got all the files in the correct directories, and  i'm running the command from within the correct directory.

How can we add security to a PDF file created using LibreOffice?\nI want to create PDF files which cannot be edited and that is the reason for asking this question.\n\nA: If you're looking for setting security within the PDF itself, LibreOffice can do so. Use the Export as PDF option from the File menu. The resulting dialog has a tab named 'Security`:\n\nFor command line conversion, the man page suggest that convert can use the options set in the Writer's Export as PDF dialog. So I suppose you could set it once in an instance of Writer, close it, and then use the --convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export option. I think similar filters may be available for Draw and others as well, but I'm not sure.

And it probably never will. \nYou need to edit a file and then run a command to start a connection.\nEdit /etc/ppp/peers/provider and add these lines:\nplugin rp-pppoe\nwlan1\n\nuser \"username\"\nnoipdefault\n\nusepeerdns\ndefaultroute\nreplacedefaultroute\nnoauth\npersist\nhide-password\n\nYou must replace wlan1 with the name of your wireless interface. Use the iwconfig command to find out. In your case it could be wlan0. Replace \"username\" (keep the quotes here) with your login username provided by the ISP.\nThen edit /etc/ppp/chap_secrets: \n# Secrets for authentication using CHAP\n# client    server  secret          IP addresses\nusername *      password\n\nAgain, replace username and password with login details from your ISP (no quotes here).\nIf you're unsure of how to edit them, use sudo -H gedit <filename> to edit both files.\nThen use the command pon to start a connection and poff -a to stop all connections when you're done. Use plog to check the status of the connection.\n\nIf you are using Network Manager to connect to WiFi, you can get it to start a connection automatically when the WiFi is connected. In a terminal, type:\nsudo grep -i uuid /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*\n\nYou will see a list of files with UUIDs listed. Copy the UUID for your WiFi connection (e.g. 44f15a85-2c11-453d-b557-385ba3a5bb84). Do sudo  -H gedit /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ppp.sh and add these lines:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nif [[ $CONNECTION_UUID == '44f15a85-2c11-453d-b557-385ba3a5bb84' ]]\nthen\n    case $1 in\n    up)\n        while pgrep ppp >/dev/null\n        do \n            poff -a\n        done\n        pon\n        ;;\n    down)\n        while pgrep ppp >/dev/null\n        do \n            poff -a\n        done\n        ;;\n    *)\n    ;;\n    esac\nfi\n\nAfter saving the file, execute these commands:\nsudo chown root /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ppp.sh\nsudo chmod 744 /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-ppp.sh\n\nYou have to do this because dispatcher scripts have to be owned by root and not writable by anybody else but the owner, and should be executable.\nHere's the annoying bit: If the Wireless connection goes down suddenly, when it gets reconnected, ppp won't be able to reconnect for a couple of minutes or more. You may even have to restart ppp manually by doing poff -a; pon a couple of times.

Is there a solution or workaround?\n\nA: This is quite likely to not work.\nFirst create a script in your home folder with this in it:\namixer -D pulse sset Master 80%+\namixer -D pulse sset Master 80%-\n#!/bin/sh\n\namixer -D pulse sset Master 50%+\namixer -D pulse sset Master 50%-\n\nThe open terminal and execute the command:\nchmod +x volumeset.sh\nFinally, just to test it works, run the command ./volumeset.sh in terminal and see if it fixes the sound. If it does, open startup applications then add in the command:\n./volumeset.sh\nTo run it automatically at login.\n", "Q: How do I install JavaTM Advanced Imaging API v1.1.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 I'm trying compare images as described on this Website but therefor I need to have JAI installed.

Why is my current driver still 304?\n\nA: If you install or upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 you can install nvidia-331, NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and the NVIDIA CUDA 5.5 Runtime library directly from the default Ubuntu repositories. libcudart5.5 is the package name of the NVIDIA CUDA runtime library. libcudart5.5 requires the nvidia-331 or more recent graphics driver. There is also an NVIDIA CUDA toolkit package (nvidia-cuda-toolkit) in the Ubuntu Software Center for Ubuntu 14.04, and like libcudart5.5 it is also version 5.5. Yes, I know the version in Ubuntu 14.04 is lagging behind NVIDIA CUDA toolkit 6 (See this answer for information about how to install NVIDIA CUDA toolkit 6). \nThis answer has a screenshot showing that the NVIDIA CUDA runtime library is running on an Nvidia GeForce GT610 graphics card in Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: If a card reader + its driver are PC/SC compliant in windows, is it PC/SC compliant in Ubuntu?

From http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#CCID_compliant:\n\n\n\nThe USB CCID specification published by the USB Workgroup aims to normalize USB smartcard readers, in order to have a single driver (supplied once for all with the operating system) for virtually any reader from any manufacturer.\nPCSC-Lite project includes an open source CCID driver. This driver has been tested with SpringCard CSB6 on GNU/Linux, and should work on the other operating systems targetted by the project.\n\nSince PCSC-Lite is pc/sc compliant, and CCID is included, this should imply that all CCID compliant readers can be used in PCSC-Lite, a PC/SC compliant driver. http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/\n\n\n*\n\n*Per http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#CCID_compliant\n\nTo know if a smart card reader is CCID compliant and should be supported by this driver but is not listed bellow\nJust get the source code of this driver and do:\n\ntar xjvf ccid-x.y.z.tar.bz2\ncd ccid-x.y.z\n./configure\nmake\nsudo ./src/parse > output.txt\n\n", "Q: NVIDIA drivers causing blank screen with X mouse icon I recently decided to switch to the NVIDIA proprietary drivers on my Linux Mint 16 desktop.

Last night I was trying to move every file in a directory to another location, but accidentally did this:\n\nmv stuff /* /home/user/Downloads\n\nI was connected to the remote VM through SSH, and from that command onward, everything started crashing and burning. No command on the terminal would be recognised, not ls, not cd, nothing, and the left part of the console, which usually stated something like \n\nDimitris#>_\n\nHad turned to just \n\n#>_\n\nI restarted the machine and now it boots me into \n\ngrub rescue>_\n\n\nI tried ls, I've got three hd()s:\n\nhd(0), hd(0,msdos1), fd(0)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First one has an unrecognized filesystem (possibly the normal hd that\nI messed up since I moved everything to /home/user/Downloads)\n\n*Second\none has some directories:  \n\n*Third one's\nfirst sector cannot be read.\n\n\nAnything I can do to revert the last change, or anything? Or is it a fatal messup?\nI'm fine with just destroying the VM and creating again, but I'd rather not lose my /var/www/ directory.\n\nA: Basically, since you moved all files required for boot (for instance... /boot), your current machine is in no state for boot. However, others are.\nYou may be able to restore your machine's previous state since you know what was done. Configure your VM to boot on a Ubuntu Live ISO, select Try Ubuntu and manually mount your \"messed up\" partitions :\n# Create mount points (home only if necessary).\nsudo mkdir /mount/old /mount/old/home\n\n# Mount the former / partition on /mount/old.\nsudo mount /mount/old /dev/sdaX # sdaX being your destroyed / partition.\n\n# Mount the former /home partition (if you have one) on /mount/old/home.\nsudo mount /mount/old/home /dev/sdaY # sdaY being your former /home partition, if necessary.\n\nIf you want to get more information about your partitions, type sudo fdisk -l. This will give you the virtual drive's partition scheme. Try to recognise your partitions according to their filesystems and sizes. In most usual cases, the / partition is a large ext4 partition. If your /home shares the same partition as /, then remove it from the commands below.\nFrom there, try to revert your changes in /mount/old and /mount/old/home, then umount them, and reboot on the virtual drive. Before umount-ing, you can also go to /mount/old/var/www or /mount/old/home/user/Downloads/var/www to get your data back.\n# Find all files owned by root in the former Downloads directory, and move them back to the root (mounted on /mount/old)\nsudo find /mount/old/home/user/Downloads -type d -maxdepth 1 -user root -exec mv {} /mount/old \\;\n\n# Un-mount everything.\nsudo umount /mount/old/home /mount/old\n\n# Power off! Remove the ISO and power the machine back on.\nsudo poweroff\n\nThis seems like the most obvious solution, yet I don't know if GRUB's configuration will be able to handle the recent changes. You can still give it a try!\n\nA: I think the Ubuntu on your VM is useless, and better you install again the Ubuntu.\nBut, before you do that, you can read the Hard Disk of your VM in another way.\nHere link to how to do it, and see your files. \n\"Or you could create an entirely new Window VM and add the vmdk as a second disk to it.\"\nI think the folder you looking for: /var/www/ it somewere on /home/user/Downloads\n\nA: I just had simmilar issue!

But it worked as moving all my root folders to /opt/*, with some exceptions because of the files were busy etc.\nImmediately afterwards I started experiencing glitches in the UI and in cmd, like >ls 'ls' comand is not defined etc.\nWhat helped was to boot from new Ubuntu USB stick, select try Ubuntu w/o isntallation, go to terminal, then /media/<YOUR_HARD_DRIVE_ID> and then smth likesudo mv /media/<YOUR_HARD_DRIVE_ID>/opt/* /media/<YOUR_HARD_DRIVE_ID>/\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Software recommendations for writing a novel? This is my first time using Ubuntu so I'm little lost about which softwares are good in use and which are not... I have now LibreOffice and that will do for now but when my first draft is ready I'm going to need something where I can view my text one chapter or scene at the time. That really helps me with editing. So basically what I need is something like yWriter where I can put that massive textwall from LibreOffice as chpaters and scenes. I heard that I can get it work with Wine or something but if there is already similar sofware designed for Ubuntu, I would prefer to try that. Any recommendations?\n\nA: LibreOffice Writer can turn any document into a PDF document. Not only that it can turn any document into a nicely formatted document. LibreOffice Writer can even turn any document into an exactly formatted PDF document that is indistinguishable from an ebook. In short, LibreOffice Writer is a very versatile and powerful application if you don't mind the learning curve.\nOnce you have created the PDF document, you can use PDF Arranger (or PDF Shuffler in 18.04 and earlier) from the default Ubuntu repositories to arrange the pages of your document any way you want to like dealing out cards from a deck of cards. You can \"deal\" out the pages individually or in groups and merge, rearrange, split (Export -> Export All Pages to Individual Files) and crop the document. You can also view the whole document as a massive text wall made of individual pages and scroll through the document and zoom in and out.\n\n(Click image to enlarge)\nThis solution has one limitation. The only easy way to edit the text of the document is to make a copy of the original document and edit the changes in the text using LibreOffice Writer. So you would be using PDF Arranger to help you to visualize possible changes in the flow of your document, rather than to edit the text of the document.\n\nA: This is the sort of task on which LaTeX excels. It abstracts you entirely from formatting or paging issues and provides you great flexibility managing your document. In particular, LaTeX allows a modular approach to document structure through the inclusion of multiple files. The explanation from the Wiki: \n\nGetting LaTeX to process multiple files\nAs your work grows, your LaTeX file can become unwieldy and confusing,\n  especially if you are writing a long article with substantial,\n  discrete sections, or a full-length book. In such cases it is good\n  practice to split your work into several files. For example, if you\n  are writing a book, it makes a lot of sense to write each chapter in a\n  separate .tex file. LaTeX makes this very easy thanks to two commands:\n\\input{filename}\nand\n\\include{filename}\nThe differences between these two ways to include files will be\n  explained below. What they have in common is that they process the\n  contents of filename.tex before continuing with the rest of the base\n  file. When the compiler processes your base file (the file that\n  contains these statements) and reaches the command \\input or \\include,\n  it reads filename.tex and processes its content in accordance with the\n  formatting commands specified in the base file. This way you can put\n  all the formatting options in your base file and then \\input or\n  \\include the files which contain the actual content of your work. This\n  means that the important part of your working process, i.e. writing,\n  is kept largely separate from formatting choices (which is one of the\n  main reasons why LaTeX is so good for serious writing!). You will thus\n  be dealing solely with text and very basic commands such as \\section,\n  \\emph etc. Your document will be uncluttered and much easier to work\n  with.\n\nYou can even organise your document parts in their own folder structure and then include them in a single master file using relative or absolute disk paths.\nIf LaTeX is a novelty to you, this is probably the right time start, ahead of a new writing project. You can follow a tutorial like this to get acquainted. \nHappy writing.\n\nA: try installing story boards where you can actually create some scenes animated and you can get detailed view of what's going on with your story\n", "Q: Brother DCP-7065DN, Ubuntu 14.04 64bit: Can print to network printer but cannot use the scan function I'm using brscan4 and can ping it using brsaneconfig4 and it finds it but i cannot scan from the computer using either simple scan or xsane image scanning.

This will install the lpr, CUPSwrapper and scanner drivers. Make sure you get the right ones for your operating system (i.e. 64-bit or 32-bit). I did this step over and over again and so I can't remember whether the package installed the right ones first time or not. The brother website has instructions for installing the drivers, make sure you follow them.\nOpen terminal and enter\n\nbrsaneconfig4\n\nThis should come up with something like this \n    USAGE: brsaneconfig4 [-OPTION]   OPTION:\n   -a name=FRIENDLY-NAME model=MODEL-NAME ip=xx.xx.xx.xx    \n   -a name=FRIENDLY-NAME model=MODEL-NAME nodename=BRN_xxxxx \n               : Add network scanner\n   -r FRIENDLY-NAME [FRIENDLY-NAME ...]\n               : Remove network scanner\n   -q          : Query supported models and available network scanners\n   -d          : Diagnosis\n   -p          : Ping (for network scanners)  \n   -s:[LABEL]  : Save current configuration\n   -l:[LABEL]  : Load saved configuration\n\nFind the IP address by plugging in and turning on the printer and then hitting the menu button until you get 'Network' press the down arrow button to select 'TCP/IP' then  'IP Address'. Alternatively you can do this by using brsaneconfig4\n    brsaneconfig4 -p\n\nThen you'll have to create your scanner for the scanner programs to see by entering this in terminal\n    brsaneconfig4 name=put the name you want to call your printer here model=DCP7065DN ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nwhere x's are the numbers from the IP address you've just discovered. Then RESTART YOUR COMPUTER!!\n    sudo reboot\n\nTo get the scan button to work you need to run the scan key (this bit is apparently 64bit or 32bit specific) so there may be some issues here if you don't have the right one.\n    brscan-skey\n\nthen test if it sees your scanner\n    brscan-skey -l\n\nthis should show you the name you just entered for the scanner. \nEdit Apparently you need to run brscan-skey command once every session that you want to use the scan key. Open Startup Applications and enter \nbrscan-skey\n\nas a command to get it to run automatically.\nApparently you need to have gimp installed to use the printer/scanner scan button. It is certainly the program that opens the scans on my computer.\nYou need to have installed sane-utils, but brother mention this in their instructions.\nAll done! \nGood luck!\np.s The printer stopped working over the network for only my ubuntu computers after an update. I found that it was not accepting full length ip addresses (that is 3digits.3digits.3digits.3digits).

It is similar to IAAS \"Infrastructure as a Service\" as it allows a new machine to be provisioned. The difference is that IAAS normally refers to virtual machines, MAAS is designed to provision bare metal. This means bring a bare metal server with no operating system install to a completely working server ready for the user to deploy services on.\nThe documentation for MAAS can be found here: http://maas.io/\nIf your looking for something to deploy services, then I recommend taking a look at JuJu. JuJu allows you to easily deploy services with its charms architecture. JuJu also connects to MAAS to retrieve ready to use servers, to deploy the services on.\nThe documentation for JuJu can be found here: https://jujucharms.com/\n\nA: To me, MAAS is a way of more quickly installing something like Ubuntu Server onto many computers without having to 1) put the CD in, 2) follow the same script of responses to questions and then iteratively 3) run a lot of command line commands like \"sudo apt-get install...\" for each computer.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|  OpenStack (a.k.a.

You wouldn't necessarily need Juju or OpenStack on top of this.\nJuju makes it easy to go further and then to automate deployments of services across the collection of available nodes.  OpenStack is a collection of services which allow you to, in theory, spin up virtual computers from this collective (like Amazon EC2).  Additionally, you have the ability to serve up virtual drives (like Amazon S3).  And you can combine these two together so that you can spin up a virtual computer that attaches to a persistent drive with your data on it.\nOpenStack is getting more rubust in that it has \"high availability\" features built in--it's forgiving to system failures on a single node, for example.\nOnce you've seen the PXE boot in action and watched it successfully enlist and commission a computer you'll be impressed.  Unfortunately there are numerous bugs in all versions that I've worked with and you will end up spending plenty of time troubleshooting everything you've attempted to put into place.\n\nA: you can visit this web: https://docs.maas.io/2.1/en/\nMAAS is Metal As A Service. It lets you treat physical servers like virtual machines (instances) in the cloud. Rather than having to manage each server individually, MAAS turns your bare metal into an elastic cloud-like resource.\nMachines can be quickly provisioned and then destroyed again as easily as you can with instances in a public cloud like Amazon AWS, Google GCE, and Microsoft Azure, among others.\nMAAS can act as a standalone PXE/preseed service or it can be integrated with other technologies. In particular, it is designed to work especially well with Juju, the service and model management service. It's a perfect arrangement: MAAS manages the machines and Juju manages the services running on those machines.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7/8 I have a pre-installed Windows 7/8 and I want to install Ubuntu alongside that.

I have successfully created a dual boot system using Grub2 as my bootloader.\nThe problem is this:  when recently trying to boot from USB to run a LiveCD USB Linux distro, I have lost the ability to boot from USB.  The option does not show up in Grub2, I have ran the \"sudo update-grub\" command in Ubuntu and still the option isn't available.\nFurthermore, when booting to the UEFI screen from Win8 [Advanced startup options > restart] when going to the usual screen to boot from a USB drive (how I installed Ubuntu in the first place) the option to boot from my USB is missing.  I only see two options: Ubuntu and Ubuntu.\nNow both my Win 8.1 and Ubuntu are working fine but I would like to resolve this issue in case I ever need to boot from USB for recovery purposes.  But also I would really like to use this LiveCD and try out a new distro of Linux and I am unable to do so.\nHas anyone experienced this before or have any tips to restore the ability to boot from USB from either Grub2 or UEFI, or both?\nThank you in advance!!!\nAdditional info - I work in IT and am pretty familiar with both Linux and Windows systems.  As this is my first PC with UEFI and not traditional BIOS, I am unfamiliar with this area.\n\nA: Normally you can get to the firmware's boot manager via a function key, as Raphael implies. If that list is missing the USB option, though, it could be that the USB drive you're using is missing the necessary boot files; or maybe the firmware has flaked out and permanently removed the USB boot option. If the latter, you might be able to get it back by fiddling with options in the firmware setup utility. (Sorry, I can't be more specific; unfortunately there's so little standardization in EFIs that it's impossible to point to a specific option without knowledge of the specific EFI in question.) In a worst-case scenario, restoring the firmware's defaults might do the trick -- but that might also render the system unable to boot Ubuntu.\nAnother option is to install my rEFInd. Once it's installed, it should detect EFI-bootable USB flash drives automatically -- although you may need to hit Esc to get it to scan them if they're slow to register. Ordinarily I recommend trying rEFInd from a USB flash drive or CD-R before installing it, but that's not exactly possible for you, so you'd have to jump straight to installing it via the Debian package or PPA.\n", "Q: Does unattended-upgrades work in a guest account?

Will it perform the upgrades on background while the guests are logged, or only if I periodically login as admin?\n\nA: Unattended upgrades will work with guests (or any user), as they do not require a user to be logged in to run.\nFor more information there is a good Ubuntu community help page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates#Using_the_.22unattended-upgrades.22_package\nIt explains about how unattended-upgrades is invoked from cron and the various configuration options that can be set.\n", "Q: How to use Terminator's Options?

All the PCs will have the same configuration (i.e., they might differ in hardware but will have exactly the same software, same user accounts, with same passwords, same system settings, same icons in same positions, etc). All non-maintenance users will be using the guest account.\nCurrent scenario\nHere's what I did\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a VM.\n\n*Set it with an admin account, a non-admin account and a guest account.\n\n*Install all desired packages (ex: java, icedtea-plugin, flashplugin-installer).\n\n*Install unattended-upgrades\n\n*Use the non-admin account to:\n\n*\n\n*configure each software to the desired behaviour\n(ex: configure the Firefox start page, install AdBlock Plus and a couple addons, configure specific settings for those addons).\n\n*Set the wallpaper and the Unity launcher icons and their positions. This includes a couple custom .desktop files with custom icons in ~/.icons, manually added to the launcher in specific positions.\n\n\n*Set a symbolic link to use this non-admin account as a template for the guest account (every modification to it modifies the guest account).\n\n*Set the guest account to autologin.\n\n*Used remastersys' backup option to create an .iso. For those who don't know remastersys, the backup option creates a live session ISO that behaves exactly like the desktop system, and upon install (manual install, using ubiquity installer), keeps the same settings, including user accounts and files.\n\n\nHere's the next steps in this scenario\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually install this ISO in each lab computer.\n\n*Build a local mirror and configure each PC with the yet undefined mirror IP. (I don't know if it's relevant to the question, but there will be a local Ubuntu mirror (yet to be built and have its IP defined), and the PCs will have only it on their sources.list file).\n\n\nProblems I'm trying to solve (or find better alternatives)\n\n\n*\n\n*Before I even start installing Ubuntu on the lab PCs, I still need the extra steps of installing it on a VM, updating mirrors, upgrading packages, installing all the needed packages, setting up user accounts, changing wallpapers, installing firefox addons, configuring these addons, then creating an .iso with those settings.\n\n*Then I have to burn a lot of DVDs, and manually perform then install procedure for each PC lab. If there are not enough DVDs, I have to wait for the install to end on another computer so I can reuse a DVD. This can take a long time.\n\n*Any configuration change -- anything, from changing the wallpaper, to modifying the admin account password, to installing a new package, to changing the local mirror IP, has to be made manually on each PC. Besides unoptimal, This can lead to inconsistency.\n\n*Any updated software that performs some post-update procedure (ex: Firefox and its \"testing addon compatibility\" dialog) will keep repeating it on every guest login, until someone logins on the guest template account and runs the software.\n\n\nWhat I have considered\nI have heard one can use PXE to perform \"boot installs\" or \"net installs\", but not only I couldn't find any simple guide that I could understand, it looks like you need to extract a netboot folder from a \"clean\" ISO and use this to bootstrap the install; so it seems to me that all customizations I have done would go to waste and would have to be done post-install on each PC. From what I gathered you can't use a Live CD ISO to netboot, is that right? It also doesn't solve the problem of applying a single change automatically and simultaneously to all the machines when all the systems are already installed.\n\nA: This calls for unattended installation! The Ubuntu documentation on preseeding and example preseed file should get you started. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try netbooting to automate it even further.\n\n*Set password for root and create a non-admin account. Guest is enabled usually by default.\n\n*Copy over the home directory of a test install to finish final touches. This can be done in as a late command, and can use scp or wget. \n\n*Specify a local mirror in the preseed file.\n\n*Add configuration options for lightdm using files added to /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ (for example, to autologin the guest user) (again, perhaps by wget).\n\n*Enable unattended upgrades in the preseed file. \n\n*Install the other packages as well, either using task selection or via listing individual packages.\n\n", "Q: Why is my network speed to an AFP share slow? I've installed netatalk on my Ubuntu 14.04 box to do timemachine backups to a ZFS pool from my Mac. This is working. However, network speed seems to max out around 11 MiB/s for the transfer over ethernet. Both network cards and my router can handle 100Mbps and both the connection information dialog on the Ubuntu side and Network monitor on the OSX side  report that the connection on en0 (mac) and eth0 (Ubuntu) is 100 Mbps\nSpeedometer on Ubuntu reports that eth0 is receiving data at around 11.5 MiB/s on average. Can this be speeded up or have I misunderstood the speed I am seeing?\n\nA: As amc commented already - 100 Mbps is 12.5 MB/s or ~11.921 MiB/s, so you're getting close to wire speed. You need to use gigabit NICs and network equipment to get higher speeds.\n", "Q: Problem Upgrading - Wants to do a Partial Upgrade, Is this safe for my xbmc install?

XBMC stores its config files in your home folder (I believe), so having it uninstall and then installed again shouldn't change any settings unless it plans on overwriting your config file.

I changed by PPA for xbmc to the official one and tried to reinstall to 13.1 (Gotham).

Once done I could reinstall xbmc from the official PPA. My user data was preserved.1\n1 Note - I store my db into a mysql database, so YMMV. Additionally, this database had been upgraded to Gotham via another xbmc on the network.

Additional drivers displays Nvidia 331.38 as active but my xorg log clearly states that:\n[   352.415] (==) Matched nvidia as autoconfigured driver 0\n[   352.415] (==) Matched nouveau as autoconfigured driver 1\n[   352.415] (==) Matched nvidia as autoconfigured driver 2\n[   352.415] (==) Matched nouveau as autoconfigured driver 3\n[   352.415] (==) Matched modesetting as autoconfigured driver 4\n[   352.415] (==) Matched fbdev as autoconfigured driver 5\n[   352.415] (==) Matched vesa as autoconfigured driver 6\n[   352.415] (==) Assigned the driver to the xf86ConfigLayout\n[   352.415] (II) LoadModule: \"nvidia\"\n[   352.495] (WW) Warning, couldn't open module nvidia\n[   352.495] (II) UnloadModule: \"nvidia\"\n[   352.495] (II) Unloading nvidia\n[   352.495] (EE) Failed to load module \"nvidia\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nI've tried to install Nvidia drivers one more time but still the same errors from libva.\nIt looks like my system uses nouveau now but nouveau is actually blacklisted inside \"/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-331_hybrid.conf\"(Note that I have a geforce 660 TI installed - not a hybrid card)\nI looked around for solutions but so far nothing seems to work.

I have a 14.10 server with OpenVPN 2.3.x\nHow to configure it for IPv6 ? (I have a natted IPv4 that cannot be port forwarded.)\nI wish to be able to receieve VPN connecions from Android OpenVPN client.\nThis guide would be great, https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/openvpn.html  if there was a IPv6 version :)\n\nA: There are two device types supported by OpenVPN: tun and tap.\nTun devices receive raw IP packets and give them to a user space program. In the case of OpenVPN this program encrypts those packets and sends them on to the other end of the tunnel where they get decrypted and sent back to the tun device on that side. In other words a tun device behaves like a virtual Point-to-Point network connection.\nTap devices use raw ethernet frames instead of IP packets. A tap device is like a virtual ethernet card - any packet sent to it goes through the tunnel and back up the ethernet stack on the other side. So an OpenVPN connection using tap is like a virtual ethernet bus with exactly two ethernet cards connected - one on each side of the tunnel. The downside of using tap is that for each packet 14 more bytes (the ethernet header) are used up, the upside is that we can use any protocol over it without having to think about OpenVPN support for it. \nThe first article that describes IPv6 support in OpenVPN, uses tun while the second one uses tap:\n1) https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/IPv6\n2) http://silmor.de/ipv6.openvpn.php\nHope it could help.\n", "Q: Create an alias to a desired directory to use within the Terminal I constantly need to type:\ncd /home/geo/Geant4/geant4.10.00.p02-install/lib/Geant4-10.0.2\n\nHow do I create an alias to that directory, so I could just type:\ncd $geant (or any other word I decide to create as the alias name)\n\nIt would also help me whenever I need to use cmake because I could use $geant as well in the middle of a cmake option.\nThanks.\n\nA: Open your $HOME/.bashrc and append:\nexport GEANT=/home/geo/Geant4/geant4.10.00.p02-install/lib/Geant4-10.0.2\n\nthen run source ~/.bashrc  and now you schould be able to use it like this:\ncd $GEANT\n\n\nA: Just create a link in nautilus, and treat it as a normal folder.

However, if your DVD-R writing software used packet writing and a compatible filesytem (e.g. UDF), then it might be possible to make the already written files invisible. Sometimes this is also referred to as writing \"sessions\". Here is how to write such a DVD in Brasero.\n", "Q: Sound coming out of headphones and speakers! I'm new at Ask Ubuntu, but not at Ubuntu itself! So, I have a Dell Latitude D520 with Ubuntu 12.04.4 on it. When I plug in my headphones, sound comes out from the headphones and the speakers!I tried to enable automute, but then my speakers didn't work. It's kinda getting on my nerves because I can't listen to my dubstep... Can somebody help?\n\nA: I can help. i had the similar problem. this actually has nothing to do with whatever software or OS you are using. I had to take my computer apart and tighten my headphone jack. If its not that then i dont know what it is\n", "Q: What is X11rdp? I have been using xrdp for sometime now (along with vnc4server) and I think I understand high-level overview of its working as described here. xrdp allows to communicate with RDP protocol and uses sesman for user authentication. After authentication a new/existing VNC session is used for remote display. \nHowever, there is no description of X11rdp in the above process. I do see an option with name sesman-X11rdp on the login screen, which never works. I tried to look for the explanation of X11rdp on xrdp.org. All I could find is this: \"Xrdp uses Xvnc or X11rdp to manage the X-session\". \nCan someone explain what is X11rdp and how it is different from Xvnc? What are the pros/cons of using X11rdp over xrdp-VNC?\nPS: I could find a lot of tutorials on how to install/compile X11rdp. But, I first want to understand its purpose before going through the process of compiling/installing. \n\nA: X11rdp tries to improve on Xvnc by forwarding X11 draw commands as RDP draw commands instead of simply wrapping a vnc bitmap stream in RDP.\nDraw commands are more bandwidth efficient as it can be vector based instead of just a raw video feed.  X11rdp vs Xvnc for the desktop is similar to MIDI vs WAV for music.  MIDI describes which notes are played while WAV simply encodes the resulting sound.\n", "Q: Cairo Dock blinking when mouse over i recently installed Cairo Dock on Ubuntu 14.04 and it seems to have a problem, when I hover my mouse over it, or move around it the icons start blinking/tilting like it is having problems rendering them, it's kind of annoying and i'm almost sure it has something to do with me having selected using OpenGL during installation. It said something about reducing CPU load but that might cause trouble. \nThe thing is I can't find any options to disable it, and I even tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it but the problem persists.  \n\nA: You can try to close the Cairo-Dock and re-open it. This worked for me. I’m running 12.04 though.\n", "Q: Which recent tablet/notebook convertible PCs run Ubuntu 14.04 LTS flawlessly? I’m an Ubuntu newbie, and I’m interested in acquiring a tablet/notebook convertible PC that will run Ubuntu 14.04 LTS without lots of hardware incompatibility and driver tweaking hassles.\nIn researching my options, I notice that there is a section of the official Ubuntu website called...\n\n• Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware\n» http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\n\n...that uses the hardware categories ‘Desktops’ and ‘Laptops’. I note that search terms such as ‘Tablet’, ‘Convertible’, and ‘Hybrid’ return no results there.\nAlthough the ‘Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware’ introduction page says, “Each new release of Ubuntu brings exciting new hardware to Ubuntu users. Take a look at Certified hardware by release,” the only release for which it contains data is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  While it covers older convertibles, such as the Dell Latitude XT3 (release date: April 2012)...\n\n“The Dell Latitude XT3 laptop with the components described below has been awarded the status of Certified for Ubuntu.\nReleases: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit.\nCertification: This system was tested using the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Beta 2 image”\n» http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201104-7784/\n\n...it doesn’t seem to cover more recent convertibles, such as the Acer Aspire R7-572 (release date: November 2013 – only Acer model covered: Acer Aspire One, release date: July 2008), or indeed more recent versions of the OS, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr.  So on first impressions, the ‘Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware’ section seems to be about two years out of date, which prompts me to ask two questions.\n\n*\n\n*Are there plans to bring the ‘Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware’\nsection of the official Ubuntu website up to date?\n\n*Are there more up-to-date Ubuntu-related resources online for gauging which recent tablet/notebook convertible PCs run Ubuntu 14.04 LTS flawlessly?\n\n\nA: Note that not all the compatible laptop/desktop are displayed in \"Ubuntu Desktop certified hardware\" the lists of components are very long, so you could choose a laptop/desktop by your budget an check if all its components are compatible with ubuntu.\nYou can browse here to check compatibility. Hope this help.\n\nA: Testimonial.  I'm using a Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 which I have had for about a month. I love it. It is running Ubuntu 14.10 just fine.  There is always tweaking.  The kernel didn't want to turn on the WiFi in 14.04 and some other things but 14.10 was fixed and works out of the box.  \nThe first thing you will have to do is some dancing around the synaptics touchpad to adjust the settings which I found by googling.  syndaemon -i 1 -K -R -d brings the \"disable while typing\" back to life (bug in Ubuntu configuration).  synclient MinSpeed=0.4 and synclient MaxSpeed=0.9 slows the mouse down to usable levels.  synclient FingerLow=50 and synclient FingerHigh=55 raises the pressure threshold so the slightest brush doesn't fling the arrow across the screen.\nThe extreme display resolution has issues with all devices of this type but Ubuntu is getting better and I have found workarounds.  The easiest way to handle this is System Settings > Displays > Resolution > 1920 x 1080 (16:9).  \nI'm using full resolution to do this response which is more involved but you can figure it out.  You can scale Ubuntu at Settings > Displays > scale for menu and title bars >  set to 1.38 which was best for me.  This makes the tool bars and menus readable.\nAll the similar units to mine will require touchpad and resolution tweaking so you can expect that.  Hope this is helpful if you are still tracking this thread.\n", "Q: Is this possible to uninstall one package during another package is installing Is this possible when I installing one package I allow to uninstall another package at the same time?\n\nA: No, it isn't. The package manager exclusively locks its database, therefore only a single package operation can happen at a time. Yes, it is a little inconvenient, but the system is more robust that way.\n", "Q: 64 Bit download or Mac (AMD) download for HP Win 7 laptop AMD 8 quad core processor? Thanks! I am a bit confused.

I can also drive into Temecula, Hemet, Perris or near by area and buy you coffee, \nas it has been many years since I looked at Linux and that was Red Hat 5 and 6.  \nBobby Ray  \n\nA: You should be able to run the 64 bit versions of Ubuntu - both 12.04 and 14.04 are long-term-support (lts).  My pavilion dv7-4263 did not work well under 14.04, and I reverted to 12.04 for it - I had trouble with the graphics (radeon) in the 14.04 release, which may have been fixed by now.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Login screen password always incorrect I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 for the first time boot. I am a long time MS Windows user and don't like where Windows is headed so I decided to switch to Ubuntu and only use Windows for gaming.\nHowever. I cannot get into my computer after the lock screen appears. It says the invalid password message no matter what password I use.\nI have googled for a little bit, and the closest thing on here I could find is:\nPassword is incorrect - when tried to login into Ubuntu 13.04 [duplicate]\n. Though there is no answer there.\nI should note, that I mistakenly as a Linux newbie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did chown -R david /etc and lost the sudo power.\n\n*then I booted into recovery mode and ran a few things and ran chown -R root:root /etc and that fixed the sudo problem. But I think when I did that the lock screen stopped working and I can't get into the computer. I have to restart and have it auto login.\n\n\nI went through the first 10 suggestions when posting this and nothing close helped.\n\nA: I had this exact issue. The password worked in terminal, but not in LightDM.  I could login as other users, just not the one I wanted.  I even changed the password from a different user and also in recovery mode.  LightDM didn't give a password incorrect notice, there was just a graphical glitch.\nI don't have a fix for LightDM, but this works for me as a work-around, I set GDM as default display manager - GDM is not having any login issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GDM.\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nIt will ask you which display manager to set it as Default, select GDM.\n\n*If it is already installed. Run reconfigure.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nReference: How To Switch Between GDM And LightDM In Ubuntu 14.04 [Quick Tip]\n\nA: I encountered the same on the lock screen, and found out that my account was suddenly locked.\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04.1 (lsb_release -a). I installed the latest update and then encountered the issue, password is incorrect when the screen locked.\nSo I googled and saw that from most of the suggestions, one is to change password.\nI found out that the only account (admin account) I'm using was locked. So I unlocked it and I'm now back in.\n\nA: This isn't the greatest fix.. but it worked.  I just changed my password to something else.\nI noticed that one of the characters that I was using required being hit twice to register.  This was only happening in the GUI.  So I changed my password to not have that character and BINGO BANGO all fixed up.\n", "Q: Package skype i386 problem with Ubuntu 14.04 If I do sudo apt-get update, it will show me:\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ trusty/partner i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty_partner_binary-i386_Packages)\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ trusty/partner i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty_partner_binary-i386_Packages)\nW: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems\nE: The package skype:i386 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.\nsudo apt-get update gives me:\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I'm using ubuntu software center to installing the big package.

The best you can do is to cancel the installation with the red X button (on the Progress tab) and then start it again later. \nPartially downloaded files are stored, so if you decide to start the install again later it should resume downloading where it left off.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Desktop on server with only system management tools in it?

Is it possible to reinstall 14.04 without using any image?\nI just upgraded into 14.04. There was a problem in my installation, Is it possible to reinstall ubuntu without any image. \n\nA: No, Ubuntu system not yet provide factory reset-like mechanism. Except you have done a system backup before using third party software. So, you can't, by default, restore your system to initial state.\nMaybe later, you want to try backup software to avoid reinstalling : BackInTime. Install it by directly execute :\n    sudo apt-get install backintime-gnome\n\nOr if you want the latest, you can execute :\n    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bit-team/stable\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install backintime-gnome\n\nin your terminal.\nThen backup your system as necessary.\n", "Q: Load different music profiles for Alsamixer or kmix I would like to know if it's possible to use or configure different music profiles on (K)ubuntu for different types of music: Pop, Rock, Metal, Rap, etc when listening to that type of music.

If you have any tip that could give me a lead to the right program, configuration, etc that would be great.\n\nA: Unless you have uninstalled pulseaudio, (kubuntu ships with pulseaudio) you can install pulseaudio-equalizer. Pulse audio uses ALSA's channel but manages sound settings for individual applications without having to use kmix. \nYou can install this by typing the following commands in an open terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-equalizer\n\nYou should be able to search for pulseaudio-equalizer in the app-search area or you can just use the command pulseaudio-equalizer.\nThe EQ has default setting configurations for various profiles like rock, regge, rap, and even laptop.

The primary obstacle of the project is as follows. The project requires a set of 16 computers total. 15 of the computers will have dual monitors attached. The 16th computer would be required to act as the master computer (or server or hub) and be able to push different information to each monitor. So we're basically looking at one server pushing different information to essentially 30 different monitors. Is something like this at all possible? And if so, what programs, settings, equipment, etc. would be necessary to accomplish this?\nThank you in advance for any assistance in this task!\n\nA: Well, you have a few different options.

I've got a bit of a conundrum that I can't find anything for, so I'm asking for help.\nI recently got an AR2Drone from Parrot. I'd like to get some cool software on it, explore its file architecture, etc.\nI don't have a laptop, just a PC. It's got an ethernet cable running to my router, and a usb wifi dongle that is connected to the drone's network. The drone acts as its own wifi router, allowing connections to it.\nSo far, I've been trying to use telnet to connect to the drone. If I turn my wired connection off, I lose internet connection, but I'm able to telnet into the drone and issue flight commands to it with some software I have. But the moment I turn the wired back on, all of that stops working.\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to have my wired connection up along with the wireless connection, so that I don't have to lose my main internet connection while working on the drone. I'm baffled as to how to get this working though.\nSo I'm wondering if there is a way to force wlan0 to be my default connection, or set a specific terminal window to only use wlan0.\nifconfig output below:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 50:46:5d:6a:7e:2e  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.4  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::5246:5dff:fe6a:7e2e/64 Scope:Link\n          inet6 addr: 2002:188f:63a2:e472::1000/128 Scope:Global\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:1254101 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:649052 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1708326009 (1.7 GB)  TX bytes:52385599 (52.3 MB)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:13050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:13050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:1823178 (1.8 MB)  TX bytes:1823178 (1.8 MB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr c4:04:15:43:ed:6b  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.2  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::c604:15ff:fe43:ed6b/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:22263 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:806 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:1142847 (1.1 MB)  TX bytes:101121 (101.1 KB)\n\n\nA: You cannot have the same subnet on both interfaces!

I simply change the window manager there to fluxbox and log in my computer normally with fluxbox.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It should be fine to use lightdm to select fluxbox. Next, to fix the nauitlus issue\ninstall gnome-tweak-tool\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nthen, use the command \ngnome-tweak-tool\n\nunder desktop, look for \"have file manager handle the desktop\" and make sure this option is set to off\nsee here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2080212\n\nA: In ubuntu 16.04 there is no such option as \"have file manager handle the desktop\".\nYou can use the command fbsetbg -b -solid black to set the background to black (using fbsetroot). It will also enable/restore fluxbox's desktop context menu.\n", "Q: Why can't I send emails from the command line to my gmail account I'm using the command:\necho \"Test if email can be sent from server\" | mail -s \"Test\" myaccount@gmail.com\nThis is on an Ubuntu Server 12.04 completely up to date.\nTo catch you up on my troubleshooting:\n1) I have installed mailutils with the \"Internet Site\" option (or whatever that internet option was; I can't remember exactly what it was called off the top of my head).\n2) I have added myself to the group 'mail'.\n3) I have checked that my ISP does, in fact, block port 25. I followed these instructions using port 587, which is unblocked (I'm not sure that this has an effect on outgoing mail; it looks like a mail server to me)\n4) I've also tried echo \"Test if email can be sent from server\" | sendmail -f myaccount@gmail.com myaccount@gmail.com, but this also appears to do nothing.\n5) I am worried that gmail is receiving on port 587, but that it doesn't know what to do with the traffic. Is this an unfounded consideration?\n6) My gmail user name contains a '.' before the '@gmail.com'. Is it possible that this is confusing the mail and sendmail commands? (edit: after some more experimenting, this is probably not the problem)\n\nA: You must change the gmail security settings at https://myaccount.google.com/, by activating \"Less secure app access\". if \"Less secure app access\" is off, all emails that you send will be blocked by Google.\nand next step, you can see at https://easyengine.io/tutorials/linux/ubuntu-postfix-gmail-smtp\n\nA: SMTP servers only accept incoming mail on TCP port 25. If they accept mail from other ports such as the submission port 587, that is only for the submission of new mail from known/authenticated clients sending mail. Incoming mail from an unknown client should only be accepted on port 25.\nIf your ISP is blocking outgoing connections on port 25 you will need to either\n\n\n*\n\n*have them remove this block\n\n*relay the mail to a mail relay outside your local network which considers you a trusted client and let the relay forward it on. Speak to this relay on port 587.\n\n*authenticate as a client on the destination server using port 587 so the destination thinks of you as an authenticated client. I don't know if gmail allows this because the normal way they accept mail from clients is via web or their proprietary apps.\n\n\nEdit: the OP pointed out in a commend that Gmail allows you to authenticate and submit mail by SMTP at smtp.gmail.com on port 465 (SMTP over SSL).\n", "Q: Skype client's (group) chat not working Ubuntu 13.10, Skype client 4.2.0.13\nWhen installed the Skype client first it worked as expected (5 months ago). But for around two weeks I can't see some group chats (some I can see others I can't!) anymore. I tried re-installing with deleting of the local profile (~/.Skype) without success. Since that is not the source of the problem, I would think that it might be due to a recent system update.. but have no idea what I should do to fix this.\nAny known fixes or am I the only one with this problem?\n\nA: Skype has introduced a cloud-based group chat system, which requires Skype 4.3. Possibly that has something to do with it.\n\nA: Boring answer: Updating to the latest Skype of the version 4.3 solved the issue.\nPrevious updates from the 4.2.X line had no consequence. Probably this issue was really connected to what Gunnar said (issue being related to the newly introduced cloud-based chat).\n", "Q: Unable to change permissions for group on USB drives I have newly installed Ubuntu 14.04 for a media server.  My problem is that I have all the media on external USB drives.  The drives are write/readable by the user & Files explorer but Plex Media Server and other applications cannot even read the drives.  I've read several-dozen articles and tried various chmod and chown commands but some say \"Operation not permitted\" when trying to change permissions to 770 or 777. I've even tried to change the properties of the folders in the GUI and for group access, as soon as you change to \"access files\", \"list files only\", or \"create and delete files\" it quickly snaps back to \"NONE\".  I've reformatted the drive several times trying exFat, NTFS, Fat32, HFS+, & EXT2 but the behavior is exactly the same on each.  I've also been unable to find any way to change how it is mounted as most of the articles are for older versions of Ubuntu that don't apply any more.  (Also, I make new media on a Mac so I want a format that is compatible and quick -NTFS proved to be too slow on Mac)\nAny help?\n\nA: Ok, I found an article that explained why this wasn't working for me.  I had all usb drives mounting under /media/<myusername>/<drive_name> and this made mandatory permissions on it.  I unmounted the drive and set it to mount under /media/ then it works.  \n\nA: *\n\n*Unmount the drive\n\n*Create the mounting folder, give it full access permissions \nsudo mkdir /media/drive_name\nsudo chmod 777 /media/drive_name\n\nLate releases, like 14.04, create a user sub-folder so it will be /media/username/drive_name\n\n*Mount it again\n", "Q: Terminal - Search entire directory for keyword I am working on a Ruby on Rails project so I have to manage multiple files.

What would be the advantages of that? At Ubuntu GNOME site it says \"Ubuntu GNOME is a mostly pure GNOME desktop experience built from the Ubuntu repositories\", but I'm not sure what that means exactly.\nI am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 with gnome-shell installed. I am willing to upgrade to 14.04. Ubuntu LTS has 5 years support while Ubuntu GNOME has 3 years. That's what makes me think it would be better to install Ubuntu 14.04.\nActually, this question could be extended to any flavor of Ubuntu. Is there any difference between installing, let's say, Xubutu with the gnome-shell desktop and installing Ubuntu GNOME with xfce-desktop?\n\nA: It doesn't matter anyways since the gnome-shell specific packages are the ones that are getting only 3 years of support. The same can be said with any deskop you install, just because you install Ubuntu and install for example XFCE instead of Xubuntu doesn't magically means you will get 5 years of support for the XFCE specific packages.\nThis doesn't incluide of course Ubuntu core packages like the kernel for wich you will get Security Updates for 5 years in any desktop you use.\n", "Q: UUI installed but booting as live usb I installed Ubuntu 14.04 (I think) on an external hdd using Universal Usb installer, however when I boot from the External HDD it still asks me to install.\n\nA: Universal USB installer installs Ubuntu as Live image on any USB storage device.\nSo in order to install ubuntu on your external hard disk you need to install Ubuntu using Universal USB installer on a pen drive first.  Then boot your pen drive and install ubuntu on your external hard disk from that live boot. \n", "Q: How to manage software that is installed from source? From time to time, we may have to install something from source due to various reasons. While it is fairly standard how to install software given appropriate dependencies, it is not clear to me how to manage such installation for future convenience.\nMore specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*What can we do to ensure an easy and clean uninstallation (including those dependencies that are installed just before and just for the software installed from source)?\n\n*What can we do to ensure an easy and clean upgrade of the same software, which will likely be installed from source again?\n\n*What can we do to minimize potential conflict if there are a default package (installed using apt-get) as well as the (newer) version of the package (installed from source)?\n\nA: Using checkinstall make install will create a temporary package and install it. This means it is recorded in the package manager and can be uninstalled.\n\nA: The best thing to do would be to make Debian packages of the newer versions yourself. dpkg and the apt tools do all three things that you mention and are intended for that purpose. Use them instead of reinventing the wheel. There are plenty of guides on packaging available. If the software already exists in the repositories, you can probably get the source package (apt-get src) which you can use to study and kick start your own package.\nThis answer to https://askubuntu.com/a/485230/158442 might be useful as a general guideline.\nWhile checkinstall is great for a quick and dirty solution, long term you should use proper packaging.\n\nA: First of all, much depends upon how you manage your source codes. I make a directory like ~/sources and put every program in it's subdirectories, while others will create a new directory for every program. \nSimilarly some like me, create a new sub-sub-directory for every new version, and  remove older versions only when it's ensured that there are no significant bugs in new version that would stop my work.\nThere is no single way to do this, but whichever way you choose, choose a way that would be easiest for you to manage.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean Uninstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*I would suggest creating a rem_dep.sh script which would look like this.\n#! /bin/bash\nsudo apt-get remove dep1 dep2 ... depn\n\nwhere dep1, dep2, depn are dependencies.\n\n\n*Clean & easy upgrade\n\n\n*\n\n*if you get source code from a automated versioning system like git or bazaar or if the links are predictable you can create a shell script which will\n#1 make a backup of earlier version\n#2 get new source\n#3 configure, build/make the source\n#5 if make went correctly, remove earlier version.\n#6 make install new version, update dependencies if required.\n\n\n*In other cases too, you can create such scripts with manual work to some extent.\n\n\n*Conflict management\n\n\n*\n\n*The best way is to use the --prefix option while install softwares and there dependencies.\n\n*Other important thing is to keep your system updated so as to minimize conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: If you find yourself compiling more software than you should(set a max_limit for yourself, like 5 or 10 or 100) it's best you leave Ubuntu and move to Arch Linux.\n\n\n\nA: Build dependencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*AFAIK they should be recorded manually.

I have C++ code with more than 10,000 lines. I am looking for something which stores some lines. Like bookmarking some lines or some functions in order to facilitate access to them.\nFor example, a list which contains bookmark lines or functions.\n\nA: As a recent and enthusiastic adopter of Geany (migrating from Windows/Notepad++, which I think Geany already beats!), who has been dealing a lot with bookmarks, I have some additions/caveats to the existing answer - for the benefit of people who arrive from a search engine, since this thread is quite high up the list. These are in relation to the two plugins it mentions and I think important to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmarks Sidebar does not update when bookmarked lines are moved up or down, using the current version of Addons. I reported this as a bug - and the response from the Geany team was immediate, so there's already a pull on SourceForge - which I've compiled and can confirm fixes it flawlessly. :-) I assume this'll be in the next release.\n\n*The Numbered Bookmarks plugin, to save changed bookmarks/folds, requires the source file be saved - so if we've finished typing, saved, then change bookmarks/folds - we must re-save, which requires enabling Preferences/Various/allow_always_save (allow saving files not marked changed), or make 'dummy' edit to re-save. I am trying to log a FR to have bookmarks/folds auto-saved, or - maybe better (if not bad design/UX) - mark the file changed so we can see and choose whether to save them.\n\nA: This is the normal way to create bookmarks in Geany:\n\nBookmarks\nGeany provides a handy bookmarking feature that lets you mark one or\n  more lines in a document, and return the cursor to them using a key\n  combination.\nTo place a mark on a line, either left-mouse-click in the left margin\n  of the editor window, or else use Ctrl-m. This will produce a small\n  green plus symbol in the margin. You can have as many marks in a\n  document as you like. Click again (or use Ctrl-m again) to remove the\n  bookmark. To remove all the marks in a given document, use \"Remove\n  Markers\" in the Document menu.\nTo navigate down your document, jumping from one mark to the next, use\n  Ctrl-. (control period). To go in the opposite direction on the page,\n  use Ctrl-, (control comma). Using the bookmarking feature together\n  with the commands to switch from one editor tab to another\n  (Ctrl-PgUp/PgDn and Ctrl-Tab) provides a particularly fast way to\n  navigate around multiple files.\n\nSource\nTo add a list of these bookmarks, you have to install the Geany plugin \"Addons\":\nsudo apt-get install geany-plugin-addons\n\nTo remember the bookmarks at each file load, the plugin \"Numbered Booksmarks\" is required:\nsudo apt-get install geany-plugin-numberedbookmarks\n\n(You have to save the file if you want save the bookmarks.)\nAfter the installation, enable the plugin to load at startup:\n\nNext step: Activate the bookmarklist -\n\nBookmarklist example:\n\n", "Q: Adjust Firefox and Thunderbird to a High DPI touchscreen display (retina) If you are using a high DPI Display with a resolution of 3200x1600 px you can adjust Unity with a System wide Menu and titlebar scaling But Firefox is not really ready for this: All pages and the Icons stay tiny.\nmultiplication of system font increase and browser font increase makes system controls (combobox, lists, drop down lists) extremely big on many websites, where the form elements are affected by the scaling two times, so all form elements are huge (4x).\nemails in Thunderbird are displayed tiny, so you have to use Ctrl++ all the time\nHow can I adjust Firefox and Thunderbird, so everything will look normal?\n\nA: I looks like Firefox 36.1 atleast, now picks up the scaling setting form Ubuntu.

The command is executed in the starting directory.\n\n\nA: Ideally you should use -print0 with find, so filenames with spaces don't screw things up.\nE.g. this should work :\nfind . -whatever-flags-go-here -print0 | xargs -r0 mv -t target-directory\n\nmv -t is directly usable with xargs as the source files are at the end of the argument list:\n   mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\n\n   -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY\n          move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY\n\n", "Q: Ableton and Wine...

Especially with the development versions of Wine. There isn't a whole lot of things you can do about it other than to verify you did everything in the HOWTO section on WineHQ and to just try to run the same version of Wine where it was rated platinum.\nAs you can see on Ableton's WineHQ page, it looks like it works best with Wine 1.5. In this case, a Wine front-end like PlayOnLinux can help a lot because you can manage multiple versions of Wine with it in a very easy way.

It could be binary. It could be Bash or Python or PHP or whatever; they all have a shell script hash-bang. If you blindly force it through sh,  who knows what could happen. It'll probably error-out but it could accidentally run harmful code before getting that far.\nBy chmodding it (to enable the execution permission bit) and then running it ./script.run, you give it the best possible possibility of running. If it's a shell script, its hash-bang will be parsed properly and if it's a binary executable, it'll just run natively.\n\nA: If you use \nsh ./<script>.run\n\n/bin/sh (usually a Bourne shell) will used to run the script. Of course this only works if the script is written for Bourne shell. Sometimes shell scripts for Linux require Bash instead of Bourne shell, so this may not work even if it is a shell script.\nIf you use\n./<script>.run\n\nthe kernel looks at the shebang line to find out which program to use to run the program. So this works even if it is a Bash, Perl, Python or some other script. \nThus this is usually the preferred way to run a script.\n\nA: The two methods can often act the same but are very different.\nsh ./script runs the sh command with an argument ./script, which happens to execute the given script.. even if the script is not actually a sh script (bad)\n./script executes the given file. It does this by looking for the \"shebang\" line to determine what command to run. If unspecified it uses sh (this the two methods act the same sometimes), but often a different interpreter is specified..\nFor example, if filename contains the following:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nprint \"This is a Python script!\"\n\n..then the two commands are very different:\n$ sh script\nscript: line 3: print: command not found\n$ chmod +x script\n$ ./script\nThis is a Python script!\n\nIf there is no shebang line, the two are the same:\n$ cat script\necho \"This is an sh script\"\n$ sh ./script\nThis is an sh script\n$ ./script\nThis is an sh script\n\n\nA: One important difference is if your hashbang line has parameters. For example, if the script starts with \n#!/bin/bash -e\n\n...and you run it externally using sh or bash, that line will be interpreted as a comment and ignored, so the -e parameter (exit on failure) won't be processed. So, given the following script:\n#!/bin/bash -e\necho Hello\nfalse\necho goodbye\n\nThe output for ./script will be just \"Hello\", but the output for sh script will be Hello followed by goodbye, which was probably not intended.\nThis, by the way, is why you should always use a separate set -e statement (it's a good idea anyway - more often than not, if there's a problem mid-script, you wouldn't want it to be ignored).\n\nA: No  \n[sudo] chmod +x ./<scrupt>.run makes the script executable so you can run it with ./<script>.run.\nWith [sudo] sh ./<script>.run you can run it, even if it is not executable.\n", "Q: Opera 24 Developer for Linux will not launch Today I downloaded the much anticipated, for me at least, Opera 24 for Linux.

I have had laptops boot correctly using the Windows bootloader (Which is blue with several light blue options) and some that have completely failed, forcing me to install the Live USB and recover the boot loader from within the Ubuntu Live System or doing it everything from zero.\n\n*Again, depending on the hardware and system configuration (Like Fastboot enabled) the boot loader might simply fail forcing you to either recover the boot part from an Ubuntu Live system or install it from scratch.\nThere are several points you really need to worry when you are at this point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not enable fast boot. Leave it disabled. For more information see Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI because this will create some issues when trying to registered the boot changes on the new boot manager (Windows based) and even detecting correctly the boot parameters and partitions with grub-repair or GRUB.\n\n*Sometimes boot-repair from the Ubuntu Live system will fail on this cases. This problem put together with the fact that the upgrade to 8.1 creates even more issues to any non-windows system (Go Microsoft you are the best!) GRUB might even suffer from 8.1. Please see this answer for a guide to fix this: Cannot Restore Grub After Windows 8.1 Upgrade It is the only one that has worked so far for me.\n\n*To solve many of the issues coming from Windows 8.1 please disable fast boot and follow Grub not showing on startup for Windows 8.1 Ubuntu 13.10 Dual boot which might help.\nIn the end, to solve boot issues from Ubuntu's side, first disable fast boot (hibernation mode) and then try to boot-repair the system or follow any of the advices here. I can only imagine what Windows 9 or 8.2 will bring to the whole compatibility table. Sorry you had to suffer this.\n", "Q: Use Ubuntu Server as Proxy First of all if i'm asking this question at wrong place i'm terribly sorry for it. I'm an expert about NT Servers but very rookie about linux systems, i'm making tests to learn it. I want to share internet connection via Ubuntu Server but i don't want to enter proxy address from IE or Chrome to user's computers manually. Maybe some of you know devices like Sonicwall etc. those devices provides ip address, gateway and dns to computers so you don't need to enter manually. I found many articles about squid & dhcp installation and configuration but almost in every article people says you need to enter proxy settings manually. I was wondering can you guys offer me an article or document how i can do that. As i said before i google it so many articles and they give you the commands and parameters but almost none of it explaining why we using that command, i mean what does it means or what does it do. If somebody can share an article or document or link for a rookie as me it will be great.\nThanks for understanding and thanks in advance.\n\nA: You stated \"share internet connection\" in your post, but I get the sense (from your mention of Sonicwall) that what you actually want is to have a highly configurable device on your network for monitoring traffic, traffic shaping or QoS, and blocking certain sites or services.\nIf you want it to be transparent and not have to change any settings on the user's PCs, you would probably have to set up an Ubuntu server as the default gateway on your network. Right now you probably have a router of some sort that connects your internal network with the outside world. You would basically be setting up an Ubuntu machine to replace your router.\nIt is possible to set up an Ubuntu server to do what you want without making it the default gateway on the network, but the problem is those aren't as transparent. You'll need to change settings on the user's computers to point to this box. The downside to setting up an Ubuntu gateway is that it's a fairly tall order for a Linux newcomer. The upside is Ubuntu is typically documented very well and you will get a huge amount of flexibility in how you configure, block, QoS, and monitor traffic.\n", "Q: Internet isn't working on Ubuntu 14.04 running as VirtualBox guest OS I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr as guest OS on VirtualBox running on Windows 8, but Internet isn't working on the my guest OS.\nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: This is how I fixed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Windows 8, go to Network and Sharing Center → Virtual Host-Only Network → Properties and tick the VirtualBox Bridged Networking Driver option. Then click on the Ok button.\n\n*On VirtualBox, go to the Devices menu → Network → Network Settings.... In the Adapter 1 tab, select NAT from the Attached to drop-down menu.\nThat's it.

I was using Bridged Adapter, and it worked fine for at least a week; then the guest OS was not able to connect to Internet anymore. \nI tried changing the DNS on the guest OS; restarting the guest OS; shutting down the guest OS, closing VirtualBox, re-opening it, and restarting the guest OS; restarting the host OS. Nothing worked. I checked if Cable connected was still selected, and it was.\nThen I found Oracle VM VirtualBox: Networking options and how-to manage them, which explains how to get access to Internet from the guest OS, and make a server running on the guest OS available to the local network without using Bridged Adapter as network type.\nI set the following values:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attached to: NAT\n\n*Adapter Type: PCnet-FAST III (am79C973)\n\n*Promiscuous Mode: Allow VMs\n\n*MAC Address: I left the value shown from the dialog\n\n\n\n\n\nI found an article saying to copy the MAC of the connection used from the host, but I tried that, and it didn't work. Leaving the MAC shown, or letting VirtualBox generate one, seems the only way to work it.\nIf I need to make a server running on the guest OS be visible on my LAN, I click on Port Forwarding and add a row with Host Port and Guest Port.\n", "Q: how to run local shell script over ssh with su option I have a script called test_ms.sh which I want to run over ssh along with the su - username option.\nI am user X on server A and server B and I have su access to user Y on server B.

My PC has 2GB memory installed. I tried installing Ubuntu version 14.04 but failed so I thought it was too advanced for my system. I have now tried to install version 13.10 and I am having the same problem, after going some way of installing to the page where I enter my details and error message popus up saying that the installation has failed (errno 5) regarding bad disks etc. If I opt to try Ubuntu from disk all works fine, I click on icon to install and it goes as far as the screen when I opt to install. What can be the problem? I was running version 12.04 on the old hard drive and all of a sudden the screen went all fuzzy with all the colours spread out. I was not able to boot the PC after so I decided that the hard drive had gone because it could not function. I used Puppy linux disk to gather the information off the disk and tried to install 14.04 onto it, but that was failing also. It does not look like a hardware problem as all seems to be fine. I have checked the contents of the hard drive and all the files look as if they have installed correctly. I have changed the BIOS setting and only get flashing cursor when booting from hard drive.\n\nA: I came across this thread which may help: \nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1910258\nLooking at errno 5, that indicates bad I/O (input/output.)

If nothing then, I'd be worried about a bad logic board on the drive.\n", "Q: How to save the contents of unlogged console screen to a file? I'm on a tty, with a lots of command inputs, bulk of verbose their output, and some error messages. Now I have to get all those stdin/stdout/stderr texts, in the format displayed in the console screen, dumped to a file. How can I get that done using the inbuilt tools (preferably)?\nI don't know if the question is confusing! It's really a simple one.. Suppose I logged into tty1 console terminal, ran some commands (with no logging enabled, because I didn't feel the need to) but suddenly there came certain outputs/messages that I want to dump into a file (or the other option get a pen and a paper).\nThe reason why I am assuming this could be done is because you can use the shift + PgUp/PgDwn to shift the screen outputs, which means they are still there in the buffer (even if the processing is pipelined)! ..and that is what should be recovered.\n\nA: TTYs use \"virtual console memory\" devices to buffer their screen content. You can read more about them in man vcs but this will let you get what is on the screen at the current moment.\nIn practise these are just numbered files in /dev/ that line up with the TTY number. Here's an example I did with TTY2:\n$ sudo fold -w$(stty -F /dev/tty2 size | awk '{print $2}') /dev/vcs2\n\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS bert tty2                                                      \n\nbert login: oli                                                                 \nPassword:                                                                       \noli@bert:~$ cd test                                                             \noli@bert:~/test$ ls                                                             \nMadonna - 10 - Bedtime Story.mp3  output_MP3WRAP.mp3                            \nMadonna - 11 - Take A Bow.mp3                                                   \noli@bert:~/test$                                       \n\nThe fold -w$(...) there is because the buffered output doesn't appear to have the control characters or newlines I would expect. This simply adds \\n at the end of every line.\nAs TuKsn points out in the comments, you don't have to mess around with all this, you can achieve exactly the same with:\nsudo screendump 2\n\nYou can stick > tty.log on the end of either command to write the output to a file called tty.log in the current directory:\nsudo screendump 2 > tty.log\n\n\nAgain, this will only get you what is on the screen. Even if you increase the scrollback buffer in TTYs, this isn't stored in accessible memory. You can alter that but that involves recompiling the kernel.\nThat would involve rebooting and losing the current screen so if you can do that there are much easier options for logging future IO, like screen or tmux or just script.\n\nA: Probably you can use a program named screen. It saves all output of Terminal into a file. Have a look at this Ubuntu Forums thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1379903.

It's a requirement. Right now, I want to get used to it a little more, so I plan on installing Windows preemptively.\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 14.04, though originally my laptop came with Windows 8 installed. I believe this means that my activation code or whatever is stored within the BIOS(?). I do not own a CD with Windows 8(.1) on it.\nI have a 250GB external hard drive -- more than enough to store all my files.\nNow, my question is, what is the easiest and safest way to switch to Windows 8(.1), while keeping all my files?\nI've tried dual-booting in the past, but it didn't work out for me.\nI thought of this plan:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I'd copy my entire Home folder to my external hard drive.\n\n*Meanwhile, I'd search the PirateBay or KickassTorrents for a copy of\nWindows 8(.1) (this is legal in my home country: I'm allowed to\ndownload anything I've technically paid for) \n\n*Then I'd burn that copy to a CD or DVD\n\n*Then boot up from the disk and tell it to erase all data and install\nWindows\n\n*Lastly, I'd reallocate all my files from my hard drive to my laptop\n\n\nIs this a reasonable plan of action? \nI'm extremely afraid I forgot an essential step or am planning to do something that simply is not possible.\n\nA: I think you can get the activation code from BIOS with some help from this article.\nYour general approach is fine, but to be really sure to not loose anything, I'd just make space for a windows partition and try to keep your current install. Have a look this answer and try to adapt it to your situation.\n\nA: You general idea works, but you should really try to find your original Windows license key. Maybe also check if your university has an MSDN Academic Alliance (MSDNAA) or Dreamspark program. There you can usually download the correct (newest) Windows and also get a valid license key. Using a license key that isn't yours is asking for trouble when it comes to using Windows update, as other people have probably also used the same key.\nThe other possibility is to run Windows inside VirtualBox: I've set Windows to use 4GB of RAM and 3 CPU cores and even heavier things like Photoshop work totally fine. The only thing that does not work is 3D heavy applications like games and probably CAD software (although I haven't tried).\n", "Q: How to prevent a partition from being mounted [by dolphin]?

How to change Unity 3D to 2D on Ubuntu 14.04? And, will I get any improvements in performance if do that? What software utilities will I lose if I switch to from Unity 3D to 2D?\n\nA: Cannot promise performance boost as such, but see if this can be of any help (from https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/speed ).  \nDisable the visual effects: switch to a 2D desktop environment\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, when your video card can handle it, the 3D visual effects are enabled. However, these may cause malfunctions or sluggish performance. You can disable them by switching to a 2D desktop environment.\n\n\nThere are several options for this.\nMy personal favourite is a switch to the Xubuntu desktop. But there's another option as well:\na. First, install gnome-session-fallback:\nClick on the grey Ubuntu logo (Dash home). Query: terminal.\nClick on Terminal.\nType (use copy/paste):\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\nPress Enter. When prompted, type your password. Your password will remain entirely invisible, not even dots will show, this is normal.\nPress Enter again.\nb. Log out. In the login window, click on the Ubuntu logo next to your user name:\nThen click on GNOME Flashback (Metacity).\nNote: don't select GNOME Flashback (Compiz), because that also has 3D effects, and you want to get rid of those.\nc. Log in again.\n\nA: Unity 2D is not available in Ubuntu 14.04.\nHowever http://lubuntu.net/ is a lightweight flavor of Ubuntu, currently available at revision 14.04.  It will run far faster than even Unity 2D.\n\nA: Unity 2D package is no longer available because there's an identical alternative to go around it without having to change the shell.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Open compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*Click \"Preferences\"\n\n*Under Profile switch it from \"unity\" to \"unity-lowgfx\"\nEnjoy =]\n\nA: Unity 2D is not available in Ubuntu 14.04, thus you can't switch. The packages for unity-2d in 14.04 are just transitional dummy packages. They don't contain any files but depend on Unity 3D.\n\nA: I installed LUbuntu, then in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install unity-2d\nReboot my system, login in Lxsession and in terminal \nunity && > /dev/null\nFinaly I've got unity 2D in 14.04 LTS\n", "Q: Amiga OS theme for Ubuntu 14.04 I have been using computers since c/pm.

OK, so here's the backstory.\nSkype recently released version 4.3 on Ubuntu. It now has a menu bar, which it did not before. The only issue is that because it is 32-bit software, it's menu bar is not integrated into the unity menu bar, but instead is in the window itself. \nThis is solved by installing appmenu-qt:i386 , which I assume makes it work because it's now the 32-bit version of the appmenu-qt library.\nThe problem is that in installing appmenu-qt:i386 apt removes appmenu-qt:amd64, which means that the 32-bit and 64-bit libraries seemingly cannot be installed at the same time.\nThis is a problem as having appmenu-qt:i386 installed only breaks 64-bit QT software appmenu integration.\nIs there some way to fix this problem? Perhaps by having both libraries installed at the same time?\n\nA: I experienced the same problem and here is how I got it solved. Most probably it's not the best solution and you found a solution yourself but I'll post it anyways.\nFirst I installed the 64 bit package and downloaded the i386 manually from here.\nThen I opened the file with file-roler and extracted the /usr and copied it over. Now VirtualBox and Skype are both using global menu.\n", "Q: Unable to view or edit etc/apt/sources.list I am trying to follow these instructions to permit new updates of an opensource GIS software program to take place on my Ubuntu: http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu\nI used nano to add the following lines:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis\nsudo apt-get install qgis-plugin-grass\n\nonly to discover that sudo is \"not known\" and caused an error.  When I tried to reopen the sources.list file I get a blank screen in the terminal (below).  Please, please advise.\n\n\nA: Path you gave on the nano is totally wrong. It's not etc/apt/sources.list, it's /etc/apt/sources.list. You forget the / symbol before etc. The below command will open /etc/apt/sources.list file through nano editor,\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nIf you gave the file path wrongly, nano will open an empty window like above.\n\nA: Correct.

I have the following cron job:\n* * * * * /home/db_backups/test.sh\n\nwhich runs fine and is executed every minute. If I check with sudo grep \\(CRON\\) /var/log/syslog I get the following:\nJun 23 11:30:01 analytics CRON[9301]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)\n\nHowever, if I change the executable file to inreadobase_backup.sh:\n* * * * * /home/db_backups/inreadobase_backup.sh\n\nthe script is not run - I can see no records in the log.\nThe executable file if run by itself does the job with no error. Here is the content of the file:\nsudo mysqldump -h example.com -u username -ppassword dbname | gzip > db.zip\n\nBoth executable files have execution permissions given to everyone.\nWhere should I look at to pinpoint the problem?\nEDIT\nThe job runs and creates backups successfuly if I add to sudo crontab -e the following line:\n*/5 * * * * mysqldump -h example.com -u username -ppassword dbname | gzip > db.zip\n\nHowever, if I move the execution line mysqldump... db.zip to inreadobase_backup.sh file and specify it for the job:\n*/5 * * * * /home/db_backups/inreadobase_backup.sh\n\nthe job doesn't create backups.

And the only line the file contains is this:\nmysqldump -h example.com -u username -ppassword dbname | gzip > db.zip\n\n\nA: I assume you've added this as a crontab of your own user. The problem is thatcron has no way of authenticating to sudo so it can't run your command. The simplest way around that is to add the crontab to root's account instead:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nThen, add this line:\n* * * * * mysqldump -h example.com -u username -ppassword dbname | gzip > db.zip\n\nThere's no need for a script for something so simple so you may as well add the command itself. Either way, you don't want to use sudo with it.\n\nIn response to your edit:\nTo rule out various possible complications, make inreadobase_backup.sh look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/mysqldump -h example.com -u username -ppassword dbname | /bin/gzip > /home/maximus/db.zip \n\nThen, to capture any errors, redirect the error output of the script to a file by adding 2> file to your cron line:\n*/5 * * * * /home/db_backups/inreadobase_backup.sh 2> /tmp/cron.error\n\nYou can then check /tmp/cron.error for more details.\n", "Q: dconf change a string key I'm trying to change a string based dconf key with a bash script, using the following command line: \ndconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/preferences/show-directory-item-counts 'never'\n\nBut it return the following error:\nerror: 0-5:unknown keyword\n\nUsage:\n  dconf write KEY VALUE \n\nWrite a new value to a key\n\nArguments:\n  KEY         A key path (starting, but not ending with '/')\n  VALUE       The value to write (in GVariant format)\n\nCan someone help me?\nedit 1 : I'm trying to make nautilus to not count the number of item in the directory (for optimization purpose)\n\nA: What steeldriver said is the right way to do it.

I have seen How to Make a Bit Copy of my Internal HD to an Extneral HD?. It does not address the question I pose.\nI need to upgrade my /dev/sda (disk 0) to a bigger disk. \n/dev/sda supports 7 volumes (logical and extended partitions) and 2 OS (Win XP and Lx Trusty).

(/dev/sda will have changed and for instance I surmsise I would need to look carefully at my fstab after the fact because of the fact that partitions are referred to by their UUID). \n\nA: Yes, bit-by-bit copy is possible from a smaller to a bigger drive.\nI did so from a regular SCSI-ATA 240 GB conventional HDD (/dev/sda) to a new ATA 500 GB SSD, mounted as a USB external drive, using a live Ubuntu DVD with GParted, ddrescue and dd  available.\nObviously the new SSD needed to be formatted (using GParted) into something suitable for the live Lx to be able to mount it.

I don't know what HAL is or DRM. I'm just a poor, Linux-ignorant user who finally escaped from Microsoft prison after 40 years and just wants to play movies on my new Linux laptop.\nPossibly I just need clarification. I just installed 14.04 LTS. From \"Recommended...\" I get the impression that I can't watch Amazon instant movies and that there is nothing I can do about it. Yes? Really? I have to open the dreaded and hated laptop with Windows 8.1 in order to watch movies in bed??? So much for my planned campaign to convert my friends and family...\n\nA: I don't use amazon prime, but I know someone who does and I've seen it used before. The way I saw it done was through amazon.com, just go to the prime tab (sign in of course) and to prime instant video, your library should show up there.\nAnd I've no idea what HAL is (other than the computer from 2001 A Space Odyssey), but DRM is Digital Rights Management and attempts to prevent piracy (not very successfully).\n\nA: This procedure worked for me after upgrading from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS. I tried a great many workarounds before trying this one. I don't know whether this procedure alone will work, but I plan to try it in a VM later this week.\nFirst, I installed the HAL from a particular PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mjblenner/ppa-hal\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install hal\n\nNext, I reset the license files. I considered this to be completely safe in my own case, because I don't have any protected content. But the linked page includes this caution.\n\nBe careful when resetting license files. When you reset license files,\n  Flash Player resets all existing license files for protected content\n  that plays on your computer in Flash Player.

They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure\n# consult the online docs. You have been warned.\n#\n# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:\n#  1.

If you have problems with this profile, then try removing all hashes (#) after line 15, and reload the profile with apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.skype.\n# Last Modified: Tue Jun 24 05:59:42 2014\n#include <tunables/global>\n\n/usr/bin/skype {\n  #include <abstractions/audio>\n  #include <abstractions/consoles>\n  #include <abstractions/dbus-session>\n  #include <abstractions/gnome>\n  #include <abstractions/kde>\n  #include <abstractions/nameservice>\n  #include <abstractions/video>\n\n  deny /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/** r,\n  deny owner @{HOME}/docker** r,\n  deny owner @{HOME}/.mozilla/ r,\n  deny owner @{HOME}/.mozilla/** r,\n\n#  /dev/ r,\n  /dev/video[0-9]* mrw,\n#  /etc/ r,\n  /etc/asound.conf r,\n  /etc/machine-id r,\n  /etc/xdg/Trolltech.conf r,\n#  /etc/xdg/Trolltech.conf rk,\n  /etc/xdg/sni-qt.conf r,\n#  /etc/xdg/sni-qt.conf rk,\n  /sys/devices/pci*/*/usb[0-9]*/*/{idVendor,idProduct,speed} r,\n  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/scaling_{cur_freq,max_freq} r,\n#  /tmp/** rwlk,\n  /usr/bin/kde4-config mrPUx,\n  /usr/bin/skype mrix,\n  /usr/bin/xdg-open mrPUx,\n  /usr/lib{,32}/libv4l/v4l2convert.so r,\n#  /usr/lib{,32}/libv4l/v4l2convert.so mr,\n  /usr/lib{,32}/skype/skype mrix,\n  /usr/share/icons/*/index.theme r,\n#  /usr/share/icons/*/index.theme rk,\n  /usr/share/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-*-rc r,\n#  /usr/share/skype/ r,\n  /usr/share/skype/** r,\n#  /usr/share/skype/lib/libQtWebKit.so.4 mr,\n  /{run,dev}/shm/pulse-shm* r,\n#  /{run,dev}/shm/pulse-shm* rwk,\n#  /home/ r,\n  owner @{HOME}/ r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.Xauthority r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.cache/fontconfig/* r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.kde/** r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.Skype/ r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.Skype/** rwk,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/Skype/ r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/Skype/** rwk,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/Trolltech.conf r,\n#  owner @{HOME}/.config/Trolltech.conf rwk,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/oxygen-gtk/argb-apps.conf r,\n#  owner @{HOME}/.config/oxygen-gtk/argb-apps.conf rw,\n  owner @{HOME}/.config/pulse/cookie r,\n#  owner @{HOME}/.config/pulse/cookie rwk,\n  owner @{HOME}/.icons/** r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.kde4/share/config/gtkrc-2.0 r,\n  owner @{HOME}/.kde4/share/config/kdeglobals r,\n#  owner @{HOME}/.kde4/share/config/kdeglobals rwk,\n  owner @{HOME}/.kde4/share/config/oxygenrc r,\n  owner @{HOME}/Downloads/ r,\n  owner @{HOME}/Downloads/** rw,\n  owner @{PROC}/[0-9]*/cmdline r,\n  owner @{PROC}/[0-9]*/fd/ r,\n  owner @{PROC}/[0-9]*/status r,\n  owner @{PROC}/[0-9]*/task/ r,\n  owner @{PROC}/[0-9]*/task/[0-9]*/stat r,\n  @{PROC}/*/net/route r,\n  @{PROC}/[0-9]*/net/arp r,\n  @{PROC}/sys/kernel/{ostype,osrelease} r,\n  @{PROC}/sys/vm/overcommit_memory r,\n}\n\n\nA: You will have to manually review and debug they Apparmor Profile you copied from Arch. My guess is that you can review and make a few (minor) changes.\nIf you can not do this, then I suggest you put the profile into complain mode and run aa-logprof\nsudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.skype\n\nOpen and use Skype. Close Skype.\nThen run aa-logprof\nsudo aa-logprof\n\nReview and accept the changes.\nI suggest you review the final profile ;)\nThen re-enable the profile\nsudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.skype\n\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor\n", "Q: how to i make a live ubuntu on my usb with persistence that can boot both from pc and mac?

There are a lot of archives I'm trying to extract, but when i extract a folder with files in it or a folder with many folders and files in it, all the files are extracted out of the folders. How do i fix this?\n\nA: If you right click the archive and choose Extract here, you should get the behavior you want by default.\nBut perhaps you want to examine the contents first and are opening the archive with archive manager and then using the Extract button. \nIn that case, make sure that under Actions in the extract dialog the checkbox Keep directory structure is checked.\n", "Q: how to give user server name instead of ip when connecting through SSH? I have a virtualbox on which I have installed ubuntu 12.04. My host computer is Mac OS (mavericks). I did a SSH key copy to my remote (which is ubuntu server and I call it myubuntu).\nwhen I did \nssh username@myubuntu\nssh: Could not resolve hostname ubuntuhadoop: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nbut when I tried:\nssh username@66.90.115.178\n\nI was able to log in to the remote server (which is myubuntu).\nwhy is it need that I give IP address it connects properply but not the servername.\nI am not sure if this is possible. But I found in one of youtube tutorials. \nssh myubuntu (NOT username@myubuntu)\nand logged onto the remote server, without username. is this possible?\n\nA: You have a few options.\nIf you need access from only a few locations, or a single location, update /etc/hosts\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nAdd an entry for your server\n66.90.115.178 myubuntu\n\nSecond, purchase or find a free DNS service, http://www.noip.com/free/ or similar.\nThird, ssh uses your current user name by default, so if you have the same user name on both client and server, just ssh server_name\nssh your_server\n\nYou only need to specify a user name if the names are different or you want a new user\nssh new_user@your_server\n\n\nA: I also had this problem. I had defined another host as below (in /etc/hosts):\nhostname1 IP1\nhostname2 IP2\n\nI changed it to:\nIP1 hostname1\nIP2 hostname2\n\n", "Q: 5.1 surround through home theater I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm trying to use my home theater system on my pc. It's connected through S/PDIF however in the sound settings it only sees it as stereo. I played a surround sound test on youtube, and my computer is only using left, right, and center. It's playing low frequency sound through the sub, but its not detecting it as its own channel. Any help is greatly appreciated.  \n\nA: You can't get 5.1 surround through SPDIF as its only supported on PCM encoding, and PCM only support stereo up to 24bit/192khz.\nAC3 and DTS encoding support surround, this post should solve your problem (theoretically), as in installs an AC3 plugin that should allow you to play 5.1 surround through SPDIF.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DigitalAC-3Pulseaudio\nIn lot of cases your would require to always keep pavucontrol up. That's right - Just don't close it.\nSelect one of the two Digital Surround 5.1 profile options (one includes Analog input) under the built-in audio section under the configuration tab of pavucontrol then DON'T CLOSE that app, you will get working 5.1 audio in all other programs.\nIf you close it, you won't get the surround sound.\nOne last tip, don't use youtube for surround testing, it doesn't support it, use this link, u'll download a test video file that works really well.\nhttp://www.tfm.ro/win32-projects/test-avi-ac3/\n", "Q: Why does this action fix my Wi-fi? I found the below answer to fix my intermittent Wi-fi connection:\nUbuntu connect drops. Worked for a while then started dropping again\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can someone explain in plain English why would this work, because my connection was never asking for any other router's authorization?\n\n*Can someone also explain why the MAC device address entry is entered in the BSSID, while there is another MAC device entry in the same pop-up box? What is the conceptual difference between the two?\n\nA: The reason assigning a mac address worked is because you had several networks that your computer was picking up all at or stronger then your connection so your computer was roaming continually from the strongest signal network to the next.\nBSSID is the MAC address of your router. \nThe other MAC address is the MAC address of your wireless device.\n"]
