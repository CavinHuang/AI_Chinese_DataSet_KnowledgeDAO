["Q: If I buy an iPhone 6 in Germany, will it work in the U.S.? I know this works the other way around because I have my old 5 here in Germany right now and removing my U.S. sim card and putting in a pre-paid German sim card worked just fine.\nI'm due for an upgrade and my phone is basically on its way out. I'm considering buying a new iPhone 6 here in Germany. When I'm back in the U.S., if I put my old U.S. (verizon) sim card in, will the phone work as usual?\n\nA: As long as the phone you buy is factory unlocked (not a \"no-contract\" carrier phone), it should work. Same goes for phones bought in the United States: as long as it is unlocked, there shouldn't be a problem\nOne thing to keep in mind, is whether the models sold in Germany support LTE networks in the U.S. and on which carriers the phone can be used. It's most likely that the only major carriers you'll be able to use in the U.S. will be AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, among a few smaller carrier. See this link from Apple that explained which models can be used on which carriers.\n\nA: An iPhone 6S from Germany will include all of the frequencies and types of service that a 6S bought at Verizon has. This includes CDMA, GSM, HSDPA, and LTE. Modern smartphones from Apple and Samsung will work anywhere and all Verizon smartphones are unlocked.\nI have used my Verizon S6 Edge this summer with a 3 SIM in Ireland and a German SIM in Germany.\nThere is something odd about Apple smartphones activating in countries other than the one they are purchased in. My daughter is trying to activate her new German 6S on Verizon. Verizon said that the model she had would work, gave her a SIM and told her that the Apple servers were slow. The problem is that her husbands identical 6S will work for a few minutes after a re-boot and then it reads \"no service.\" This has happened multiple times after re-boots. \n\nA: You will be limited to AT&T, T-Mobile, and other carriers that use GSM. Neither Verizon nor Sprint permit you to bring your own handset so you will not be able to use them. That restriction also applies to MVNO networks that use their networks.\nLooks like you'll be OK with LTE frequencies.\n", "Q: Repeated keystroke \"w\" for Agar.io I've been searching for the relevant articles on the Internet and found nothing useful. Maybe I'm too stupid to understand.\nI would like to create a script that automatically keep pressing the \"W\" key, like wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, endlessly and as quick as possible when I press and hold the key, and it ends when I release the key. \n\"defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\" doesn't work in this case.\nThank you very much in advanced.\n\nA: Karabiner:\n  <item>\n    <identifier>private.w2wRepeat</identifier>\n    <name>Turn W key to W key repeat</name>\n    <autogen>\n      __KeyToKey__\n      KeyCode::W,\n      KeyCode::W,\n      DelayUntilRepeat::RawValue::1,\n      KeyRepeat::RawValue::1,\n    </autogen>\n  </item>\n\n", "Q: Automator ffmpeg script running twice I have an Automator app executing an FFMPEG shell script. For some reason the ffmpeg job run twice. Can someone please have a look?\nThanks\n\n\nA: Get rid of those get/set variable actions, and it'll stop doing that. Keep in mind that if two actions appear \"linked\" in Automator, it means the output of one is being fed to the input of the other. You don't need variables in this case. Basically, the folder from \"Ask for Finder Items\" is being passed down the chain to your shell script, along the way setting it to a variable, and then getting the same folder, and adding it to the stream. This stream now contains two folders.\nThe purpose of the get/set variable actions are for when you have a situation where you want to use a piece of data with two actions which terminate the stream. You can't get the data once it's been consumed by said action, so you have to store it somewhere so that you can retrieve it again.\n", "Q: Prevent VPN Disconnection message OSX When my computer wakes from sleep, it tries to reconnect to my VPN network before the Wifi connection is fully established. The result is that nearly every time I get this message, \"You were disconnected because the PPP server is not responding. Try reconnecting.\"\nIs there a way to disable this message or prevent OS X from reconnection on sleep (automatically of course).\n\nA: This worked for me:\nsudo nano /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n\nFind the vpn connection you want the disconnect-dialog to go away and set the key “DisconnectOnSleep” to 1 (instead of 0)\n", "Q: AppleScript choose file with Terminal action I would to choose a file/an image that is being mounted in the Terminal\nset pathelection to POSIX path of (choose file of type {\"sparsebundle\", \"sparseimage\", \"dmg\"})\n\ndo shell script \"hdiutil mount\" & \" \" & pathelection\n\nA: Well, I have no clue what you want, but your code isn't guaranteed to work, which may be your problem.

Difference between server and physical device Just for my curiosity and knowledge, all the DATA saved into services like iCloud email, Gmail email, DropBox, iCloud Drive, etc.  Do they actually take physical space storage inside each iOS or OS X device? Or they are just a mirror of their server? Example iCloud email service I do know that is a part of the 5GB but does it also take space inside the physical device? When there is no WIFI or Cellular connection at all, emails are still in the devices. \nDo you also recommend a nice reading article about this topic?\nThank you so much and have a wonderful day. \n\nA: On OS X, Dropbox and iCloud keep local copies of all the files you have stored on them. The reasoning being that Macs usually don't want for space like iOS devices do. On iOS, Dropbox doesn't store the files locally until you try to do something with one, at which point it's downloaded. iCloud handling depends on the application. I know for some applications, the files are kept locally. Pages for example will download all available documents, seeing as how text files are typically not that large. I'm not certain about the rest.\n", "Q: Can my Mac be a wireless speaker? So there are several audio related things I do with my phone (which is not iOS) that I do while at my computer, and it'd be grand if I could play my podcasts or take my softphone calls on it. Is it possible with Bluetooth, or any other wireless method?\n\nA: I don't know of any one OS X app that can do all of that for you, but here are a few recommendations. \nTurn your Mac into an AirPlay Speaker\nAirfoil from Rouge Amoeba works great for me to stream podcasts, music, radio, etc. from iOS devices to my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012). Note that you'll need to also install Airfoil Speakers which is a free, separate download (scroll down to \"Airfoil Speakers for Mac\"). The separate Speakers download requires the purchase of Airfoil, even though the download is free - think of it as an add-on to Airfoil even though it runs as a separate app. Further note that AirPlay is a one-way transmission and cannot be used as a speakerphone. See the next section...\nTurn your Mac into a Speakerphone\nNot sure what kind of softphone you have but check with your IT or phone system admin to see if there's a Mac client available. If there is, you'll also need configuration details from them so ask for that too (or have them set it up). \nThere are a couple of OS X apps that allow you to control your iPhone (and a few other types of phones) via Bluetooth but I've not had good luck with the reliability so I didn't purchase. I can't advise on those but a search online will turn up a few options if you'd like to try your luck. They've been around for awhile and are still under active development as far as I know. \nGood luck!\n\nA: I tried pairing an Android (4.2.x) phone (Alcatel One Touch Idol X) to a MBP: no love.\nI couldn't use the MBP as an audio output directly. It appeared to be a way to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem but I don't have a SIM for it so I did not try.\nThere are apps on the Google Play Store that allow Android to use AirPlay (I tried AllCast with dubious success, see http://gizmodo.com/how-to-stream-anything-from-android-to-airplay-1578516449), but this kind of convoluted \"solutions\" tend to break on each update of the streaming technology.\nThat said, in combination with the AirPlay software solutions described in this answer, it may work.\n\nA: Something like this would also theoretically work, just for audio output: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Junsun-Universal-3-5mm-jack-Bluetooth-Aux-Audio-Receiver-Adapter-Hands-free-Car-Kit-Music-Receiver/32838200156.html\nYou need to connect a bluetooth device that outputs audio with aux which you connect to your device as a microphone, and you play the sound from the microphone on the device - but at this point, it's probably more sane to just buy a bluetooth speaker\n", "Q: How to play or pause multiple instances of VLC simultaneously? I have 3 open VLC windows and whenever I see movement in one I need to pause all of them at once. Ideally I'd like a keyboard shortcut to do this. I tried AppleScript but I'm not familiar with the language and I can't see how to iterate through all processes of an application and tell each one individually.\n\nA: This will check for all instances of VLC and pause any of the instances that are currently playing something. Let me know if something unexpected happens! To create the shortcut, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create an Service, with a single Run AppleScript action, containing the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\" to repeat with VLC_instance in (application processes whose name is \"VLC\")\n    tell the menu \"Playback\" of the first menu bar of VLC_instance\n        if the menu item \"Pause\" exists then\n            click menu item \"Pause\"\n        else if the menu item \"Play\" exists then\n            click menu item \"Play\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\n\n*Set the service to receive \"no input\" and to work in \"VLC\" or \"any application\", if you want to ensure you can use the shortcut from anywhere. Save it with a name of your choosing.\n\n*Now, go into the Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard preferences in System Preferences, and click on Services. The newly created service should be at the bottom, under the name you chose. Click on the service, then click on \"add shortcut\", and specify a shortcut to your liking.\n\n*You may have to allow Automator access in Accessibility in the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy preferences.\n\n\nThat's it! You should now have a service set up, tied to the shortcut you chose that can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nA: When you have one VLC \"active\" (in front of you) hit CMD+Q and it is ended.\nAnd so with the next active one.\n", "Q: Snow Leopard *private* folder? I am running 2 OS flavors on my 2010 Macpro, 10.6.8 Snow Leopard on one startup drive and the latest Yosemite on another. \nThe Snow Leo drive contains a folder \"private\" that looked like it was 25GB but once opened and listing subfolders, dropped to under 2GB. What is the purpose of this folder? It doesn't seem to exist on the Yosemite drive at all. The drive is an SSD and anything I can do to keep it smaller would be great. This is the view of the whole drive -\n\nThe folder is named private but it's visible, and at the top level of the drive folder system. \n\nA: All the files and folders within private are needed to run the Operating System and it exists in every version of OS X. The folder private has lost its hidden attribute.\n\nA: Normally \"private\" is about 2-2.5GB, it contains \"private\" information for the OSX. You should not mess around in it.\nIt also contains the \"sleepimage\" file which is the largest file of all in this folder.\nBTW: 10.5... is Leopard, 10.6 is SnowLeopard, I assume a typo.\n", "Q: Changing the keyboard layout (NOT language) based on the input language I have a Japanese keyboard Macbook running Yosemite.\nThe input languages (sources) are Japanese and English.\nWhile the input language is Japanese, I want the keyboard layout to be Japanese (this is how it is by default, but I don't want to change this).\nWhile the input language is English, I want to use a standard QWERTY layout (in other words, the ; key should be ;/: (like QWERTY), not ;/+ (like Japanese layout).  How can I change the keyboard layout when I change the input language?\n\nA: Have you added the desired keyboards under System preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources? If yes you can change the layout of input source pressing: Cmd+Shift+Space. \n", "Q: Text-to-speech with 2 languages I am studying French and to practice my pronunciation and to learn the words, I want to have my mac speak the words out loud. My mac should say the word in English, and after that, he should say the French translation of it. So, it should speak in 2 voices alternately. The problem is that I don't know how to get my mac speak 2 languages alternately. I know how to get my mac do text-to-speech and how to change the voices, but I don't know how to change the voice from English to French during the speech.\nSo in short, I want that my mac speaks the following words: first the English word (in an English voice like 'Daniel', and after that, the French translation of that word in a French voice, like 'Thomas') :\n\nI use the [[slnc 1400]] in order to let my mac know he need to take a break for 1400 milliseconds before starting to say the next word. Otherwise, the voice doesn't take a break.\nDoes someone know how I can get this done? \nCan this be done with AppleScript or Automator? Or maybe there is a program a could use to solve this?\n\nA: check out the app \"Narrator\" (Mariner Software) - I've just bought the app for a different purpose (correct pronunciation) - but regarding to the description of the app it should solve you're problem too\n\nA: If you don't have french voices yet:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into \"Dictation and Speech\" preferences\n\n*Click on the \"Text to Speech\" tab\n\n*Click on the \"System Voice\" menu\n\n*Select \"Customize\"\n\n*Type \"French\" into the search field and check the voices you want to use. You can get a preview by clicking on them and pressing \"play\".\n\n*Push \"OK\" and the languages will download...

Is it just an iTunes/OSX bug? I think it's not related to that particular BT speaker although it's with it that I experience this for the first time.. I don't remember if I used Swinsian or already back to iTunes when testing the previous speaker.\n\nA: It's not really a solution, more like a work-around, but for me it helps if I \n\n\n*\n\n*open System-Preferences -> Sound -> Output \n\n*switch Output to Internal Speakers \n\n*close iTunes if still open \n\n*switch Output back to your bluetooth connected device (sometimes the output sounds like being under water for a few seconds and than plays normal)\n\n\nBut yeah, it's really annoying. Seems like iTunes has a built-in \"manage bluetooth\" function, which you cannot switch off. Not using iTunes seems the best solution ;-)\n\nA: Play both through iTunes and YouTube so you can hear both and then press the play/pause button on your keypad. this should pause the iTunes music but still play the YouTube video sound. Then you can exit the iTunes app.\nHope it Helps!\n\nA: Still happening on Mojave using bluetooth headphones, with Apple Music, Spotify & the browser. I've noticed that if you go into audio midi setup, and change the channel format from one option to another, and then back to the original highest setting, the headphones work again.\n\nA: Same happens with Safari and yes seems like some OS X bug\nThis also happens when f.ex. playing any youtube video while using Vox player. Pausing/closing youtube tab on Chrome/Safari stops sound in Vox. Same with f.ex. Itunes/Vox.. So yeah seemingly OSX issue.\nOnly thing I found to help was is switching bluetooth off and on again to reconnect to speakers, but I hope that someday there will be permanent solution, this bug bothers me already many years.\n\nA: I have same issue with bluetooth headphones and Safari. Whenever I pause video in YouTube or Facebook or similar, other sounds stop working (Cog player for example that I use for music, some voice call software as well).\nMy solution to this is to use youtube mute function (press \"m\" key) before pausing the video. Surprisingly, this prevents the \"global\" muting.\n\nA: And I still have the same problem with Jabra Evolve2 85, and Chrome Youtube video. MacOS 10.15.7.

On Mac when I rotate the wheel very slowly it scrolls on the same webpage say 1 line. When I scroll the same angle in max speed it scrolls 1 page. Why the scroll is not consistent on the mouse and how can I fix this?\n\nA: I believe that is by design. The Apple mouse wheel scroll settings are not designed to be proportional like they are on Windows. Since I go back and forth between the two systems I find it a little disconcerting but I don't find it that much of an issue for me.\nYou sound like it is a bit of an issue for you. There may be a program that will allow you to change this behavior, but since I have never needed it I don't have a specific suggestion for you other than to have a search on macupdate.com\n\nA: You can probably correct this by disabling the \"scrolling inertia\" option.\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad and under \"Mouse Options\" or \"Trackpad Options\" (try both) choose the \"without inertia\" option of scrolling.\nI hope it helps, let me know ;)\n\nA: I've also run into this problem after re-pairing my multi-device Bluetooth Logitech mouse with my Linux laptop. Had changes no settings on the MacOS, but no matter how low I set the scroll speed on the MacOS, it was still fast AF.\nThe solution was to re-pair the mouse using a different device number. After that, MacOS took the scroll speed into account.\n", "Q: What are all these partitions on my Mac? I know the purpose of \"EFI\", \"Boot OS X\", and \"Recovery HD\" partitions.

Additionally the EFI partition is used as a staging area for (Apple-) firmware updates.\n\nA: The reason it shows three \"Macintosh HD\" drives, is because it's trying to obfuscate the \"CoreStorage\" partitions you're seeing with the command you used. It helpfully (or not so much) tells you what volume those CoreStorage volumes are a part of (in this case \"Macintosh HD\"). Then it also shows you the mounted \"Macintosh HD\". The EFI partitions are required as a part of the GPT spec, and so any disk formatted with a GUID Partition Table is expected to have one.\n\nA: disk0 EFI is the partition with the EFI specifics of this mac\ndisk1 is the Recovery Partition\ndisk3 is your startup disk partition.\nSo you start from disk3, you can use the RecoveryPartition to \"recover\" (start up while holding CMD+R)\nYou can not access the EFI partition.\nLexS\n", "Q: FTP not working on any FTP client not even with Mozilla or Chrome I am using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10.3.

I have deleted Evernote and now when I open Quicktime and press the shortcut, Mac os 10.10 returns this error:\n\nThere is no application set to open the URL evernote://start/.\n\nMy question is how can this be fixed?\n\nA: In Terminal type\nmdfind evernote\n\nNow triple (3x) click on any line that contains evernote (that will select the line)..\nNext right click and use Reveal in Finder,that will open new window in Finder and show you that file.\nVerify and Delete.\n\nA: I had to quit the Evernote helper process in Activity monitor. That did the job.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s volume bar disappearing I have a iPhone 4s 64GB for 3 1/2 years now. A few weeks ago, my volume bar randomly wasn't showing up when I tried pressing the + or - button on the phone itself.\nAlso, the volume bar was \"grey texted\" when opening the music app and it was completely gone opening the screen where you swipe from down the screen.\n\n\nThe problem fixed itself when I had the phone charged over 30% battery power and restarted the phone a few times.\nWhen i'm getting a phone call or setting the timer, the speaker just works, no problems.\nWhen I have a headphone plugged in, the sound also works normally.\nWhen setting the option on to that i can set the calling sound with my volume buttons, the volume buttons work fine.\n\nQuestions\nHow does this come and how can i solve this problem??\n\nA: There might be lint in the headphone jack. The lint is partially blocking the contacts, which is causing intermittent behaviour.\nGet a wooden toothpick. Use the toothpick to remove lint. Be gentle.\nSome people suggest using a can of compressed air. This is potentially bad because lint can be blown further INTO the device.\nIf you need more information about cleaning your phone, there are various online sites that can help.\n\nA: This happened to us with an old iPad 2.  Specifically, there was some built-up grime in the dock connector/power cord port.  It was so bad that the iPad thought what it was sporadically connected to a docked peripheral (like an alarm clock).  When you do not see the volume bar, it's because your device thinks that it should delegate volume control to the dock.  It would happen randomly to us.\nThe way we fixed it was to repeatedly plug in and pull out a power connector (unpowered of course), which had the effect of scraping the leads clean.  However, there are other ways to clean the port like the ways suggested here: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/use-a-toothpick-to-clean-out-your-iphone/\n", "Q: Deleting Photos From Finder I am using the Photos app to organize my pictures on my mac. I had imported them a month ago and then decided to go through the Finder and Pictures directory and actually delete pictures I didn't want. So when I go into the new Photos application the pictures are still there. Do I need to go through the app now too and delete them out of there or can I reimport from that same directory. I just didn't understand why it couldn't sync with what I had deleted out of there.\n\nA: As stated, Photos keeps its own copies in its library.\n\nProvided the photos you have edited and weeded out in Finder are the only photos you want in your library, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Photos if open\n\n*Move the Photo Library.photoslibrary file to a new location. (Desktop for instance) This make take a few minutes depending on how large the library is.\n\n*Open Photos app.  It will ask you for a Library.\n\n*Create a new Library\n\n*Import your cleaned up photos to the new Library\n\n*If you have what you want you can delete the old Library.\n\n\nThis should save you lots of time.  Just be sure you have backups of your photos!\nIn case you are curious how Photos stores your photos, ⌥+Click or right click and Show Package Contents\n\n\nA: Photos copies anything you import into its own folder structure. Deleting the original isn't going to remove it from Photos. The simplest way to remove the photos from Photos is to do it from the app.\n", "Q: What can I do besides taking in to service a Macbook to remove a firmware password? I have a MacBook Pro w/ Retina (2012 I believe) which has a firmware password which I don't know. Since it is a retina I can't use the remove RAM trick.\nIf I go to reformat and reinstall the MBP will the firmware password be removed?\n\nA: No, recovery mode isn’t available while a firmware lock is engaged.\nYour only option is to visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) or one of their Genius Bars.  The process to bypass a firmware lock changed a few years ago and now requires that a certified technician (ACMT) contact Apple with the Mac's information (typically proof of the original purchaser granting permission), which Apple will then process and use to remove the firmware lock.\nYou can find a list of AASPs using Apple's locate tool, https://locate.apple.com. Select the service option and search for a provider in your location.\nEven with older Macs, where the firmware password could be bypassed by changing the RAM configuration and resetting the PRAM, the firmware lock would persist after wiping the hard drive and re-installing the OS.  This behavior still exists today.\n\nA: No, the firmware password is hardware specific, it has nothing to do with the installed operating system.  Also, Apple may be hesitant to assist you in removing it.  Situations where someone has a laptop which is locked out with a firmware password which they don't know is frequently indicative of a lost/stolen laptop.  Imagine if you lost your laptop which had a firmware password, how would you feel about the thief being helped out by Apple?\n", "Q: Opening suspicious files How can I deal/inspect a suspicious file on my mac short of installing and creating a full blown virtual machine instance? On windows when I want to open a suspicious file I use the sandboxing app sandboxie Is there something comparable/safe on mac?\n\nA: Open up the terminal and try: \nzipinfo zipFileOfInterest.zip\n\nIf you really want some \"verbose\" information output, then enter:\nzipinfo -v zipFileOfInterest.zip\n\nThe \"-v\" option will output a bit more information :)\nAlso, try man zipinfo to get the rundown of what options/etc is available.\nYou can also try:\nunzip -l zipFileOfInterest.zip\n\nThese will allow you to peak inside the .zip without extracting what is inside.\n", "Q: Turning off FileVault I'm currently trying to recover my formatted external hard drive with testdisk.\nTestdisk takes forever to load on sudo on Mac Terminal, so I tried to approach it from a live Linux Distro, Gparted.\nIt works so, however it can't write to the Mac HFS+ Drive. At the moment I'm currently trying to partition a separate partition for testdisk to write the recovered files to, however FileVault is in the way.\nFileVault is taking forever to finish, (~3 days) and so I followed this  solution and got the following progress.\nLogical Volume Family FA9F7FA6-0592-4361-A641-1DAE403816E0\n    ----------------------------------------------------------\n    Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n    Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n    Conversion Status:       Converting\n    Conversion Direction:    -none-\n    Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n    Fully Secure:            No\n    Passphrase Required:     No\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume 21F83719-063D-40EC-8958-36FBD021EE78\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        Disk:                  disk1\n        Status:                Online\n        Size (Total):          998973898752 B (999.0 GB)\n        Conversion Progress:   Paused\n        Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n        LV Name:               Untitled 1\n        Volume Name:           Untitled 1\n        Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nSeems like it has started to revert, but it is paused and hasn't actually started the process. FileVault on the Settings pane now shows as paused.\nHow to make revert process continue?\nEDIT:I forgot to mention, the Drive Untitled 1 Is my new 1Tb hard drive, which I have swapped out the Mac's original 500Gb drive. It is made by the same company, HGST, and had the same specifications. So there shouldn't be much capability problems.\n\nA: The last step in the FileVault conversion process is to restart.\n", "Q: Photos vs iPhoto events Should I be using Events or Albums? Say I go to the Zoo with my family, take some pictures and then import into Photos. Is that an Event or an Album? I always used Events with iPhoto. \n\nA: There are no Events on the Photos.app.\nYou should have all of your old iPhoto Events, but they are Albums now.\nThis answer describes a way of manually replicating some of the Events functionality:\n\n(…) you can create an Album from the last imported by selecting all in the Last Imported album and clicking the + icon on the toolbar.\n\n\nA: Unless you don't take many photos, replacing the concept of Events with Albums will quickly become unmanageable in Photos. I'd suggest turning on the sidebar and taking a look at the Photos view to see what Apple has replaced it with - an automatically generated stream called Moments. It basically does what auto-split events during import did in iPhoto, except instead of creating a discrete Event (that was basically an album with a different name), it does it on the fly as you're scrolling.\nIt has its upsides and downsides, but one nice thing is that if you later add additional photos from the same timeframe, you don't have to manually merge Events or anything like that.\n", "Q: Trouble setting up separate iTunes libraries for iPhone and iPod I've searched on here and elsewhere on the tubes on how to use separate iTunes libraries but it does not seem to be working. \nMy iPhone 5 has all my podcasts, about 4 albums worth of music, books, and some iTunes U stuff. It's library is on dropbox and the path is /Users/Admin/Dropbox/iTunes\nMy iPod classic has 50GB of music. I want it to have it's own library. Currently the library is located on my Desktop. \nI Option+click to open iTunes and choose the iPod library but Preferences still points to the iPhone library on Dropbox. Also, even with \"Prevent iPhones ... from syncing automatically\" checked my iPhone is located via wifi and appears in the iTunes device section next to my iPod. I can't find any option to disable this. (ETA: Found the button to disable wifi sync. I swear it was missing all afternoon.) Maybe put my iPhone into airplane mode, then connect iPod? But that's kind of an annoying solution to have to do every time. \nI'd appreciate any assistance in getting each device to reliably sync with it's own library/directory. \n\nA: The library and iTunes media folder are two separate entities.\nThe media folder will hold everything contained within the library.\nThe library file will hold items such as playlists and preferences.\nYou could create the two libraries then go to preferences and edit the iTunes media folder locations. \nYou will need two separate folders with the specified media in each.\n", "Q: Pop-ups in Chrome Hi I'm using Chrome in a MBP and anytime that I click anywhere on the page I`m browsing, a pop-up opens and I cannot stop it. I have already tried with configuration of Chrome but it's useless.\n\nA: Go to http://www.adwaremedic.com and download and install the Adware Medic software to remove the adware. It will search for the specific adware that usually gets installed from questionable websites, i.e. a website to stream a movie. \nOnce ran, the program will show you the file locations of the documents it is removing.\nOtherwise, go to preferences- extensions in Google Chrome and remove anything you did not install. However, this will not remove any launchagents or launchdaemons or frameworks installed by the initial installation of the adware.\n", "Q: Spotify sync to same location? I have multiple user accounts from one computer, running Yosemite.\nUsing same Spotify username, I'd like to sync songs offline and cache in the same path. To achieve this, I tried aliasing /Users/Shared/Library/Cache/com.spotify.client to each user's ~/Library/Cache/com.spotify.client.\nI noticed, however, even after one user finishes syncing, Spotify still attempts to download the songs.\nWhat can I do to use Spotify client's cached data from the same location, so that I don't have to duplicate files for each user?\nNote:\n/Users/Shared/Libarary/Cache/com.spotify.client's permission is 770 and all users attempting to access this folder is associated with the owner group to this folder (recursively).\n\nA: I've done something similar using apps in the one partition on the other. I erased the /Applications folder on one partition and symlinked the master /Applications folder in the other to the root of the partition it was erased from.\nSo, you could delete the com.spotify.client in all the users but one which will be the master, and then do something like this in terminal.\nln -s /Users/<master>/Library/Cache/com.spotify.client /Users/<nonmaster/Library/Cache/com.spotify.client\n\nNot positive this will work, but assuming the permissions are correct, it might.\n", "Q: Load earlier text messages I just got a new iPhone 6plus my text messages are only saving one screen full. I have no \"load earlier messages\" prompt. how do I view a message from a week ago?\n\nA: Define \"just got\" - as in today? Or as before a week ago? It sounds like your new device was not restored from a backup and was instead set up as new, in which case your previous text messages are not available.\n", "Q: How to stop messages appearing on phone but still on laptop So, I have a Macbook Air and I use it to talk to people through iMessage, but the messages appear on my iPhone 5c as well. How can I stop the messages coming through my iPhone temporarily but they can still go through my Macbook Air...\nIs this possible... \nMacbook Air, yes - iPhone, no please\nthank you kindly :) \n\nA: In case you do not want to see notifications for iMessage, go to Settings > Notification Center and move Messages app to Not in notification center. Also disable Banners or Alerts for it, and set it to None.\nNow Messages will not be showing on iPhone, but you will have a notification sound and unread number showing as Badge app icon.\nIn case you dont want to be disturbed by a sound, temporary disable sound also.\nPS. This will not showup normal SMS messages also, but you will get sound notification and badge.\nVery fast temporary solution, is to enable Do not disturb mode on iPhone.\nSettings > Do not disturb. \nThis will allow calls (if you set so), but disable all notifications until swithed off again.\n\nA: You can turn iMessage on and off on your device in Settings > Messages, but I wouldn't recommend it for what you are asking to do. The short answer is no, you cannot disable messages being sent to a device without turning iMessage off for that particular device.\n", "Q: Where does Alfred store web searches? Where does Alfred store default and custom web searches that you create on your Mac?\n\nA: (Note, 1) I have my Alfred preferences located on my dropbox, but the default location is at ~/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2, i.e., in your home folder's Library folder, and 2) the following is for the Alfred 2 app)\nUsing sudo opensnoop | grep Alfred.alfredpreferences in terminal (if using this you'll need to provide your admin password), I see that adding a custom web search updates the following file within the Alfred.alfredpreferences.\nAlfred.alfredpreferences/preferences/features/websearch/prefs.plist in the Finder.\nYou'll need to right-click on the Alfred.alfredpreferences file to \"Show Package Contents\" to view these folders.\nOnce you've navigated to the .plist file, it can be view via Quicklook by pressing the Space Bar whist the file is highlighted.\n", "Q: Share notes with other people on a mac I am writing a note on my mac. I want to share this note with other people on my mac.\nthis means specific users on my mac should be able to read and write to this note.\nhow can I do this?\n\nA: What you can do is go to your home folder, press \"command + up\" and open the Shared folder. This folder is fully accessible to all users. The files themselves though need to be made readable and writable to everyone. You can do this by right clicking on the file and opening \"Get Info\", scrolling to the bottom and changing permissions till they're how you'd like them. You can add users to the list for more fine-grained permission control, or just allow everyone to read and write it for simplicity.\nEDIT: Sorry, I'm crazy tired. Some of the original post wasn't true...\n", "Q: Can I get Genius Bar Support w/o Applecare/Warranty? If it is past my one-year warranty, or if I just don't have AppleCare, will I still be able to get Genius Bar support?\nTo what extent does that support cover? I'm trying to decide whether or not I should get AppleCare, as the price is quite steep. However, I think this laptop (Air) will stick with me for quite a while.\nFurthermore, will Genius Bar cover Boot Camp issues? (Like, if I'm trying to install Windows 10)\n\nA: Yes, you can. Without AppleCare, advice is free; quotes for repairs are free, but the actual repairs are not.\nWith AppleCare, you're covered for pretty much any repair, except when caused by you: e.g. LCD backlight fails? Repaired free. Dropped your MacBook and broke the screen? Not covered. You pay.\n", "Q: Recording 60fps on iPhone 5s I have an iPhone5s and I was wondering how to shoot 60fps videos since it can shoot at 120fps\nI want a reliable and a free solution please\nThanks \n\nA: The stock camera app does not allow iPhone 5 to shoot in 60fps, however there are both jailbreak tweaks and App Store apps that allow you to do so. The tweak I know is named CameraTweak (seems to be iOS 8 and below though). There is also an app named SlowPro that works just fine as well.\n\nA: It appears that the iOS app 60fps Camera will enable you to shoot 60fps on an iPhone 5s. I've not tried it, however reviews seem to be better than average and it cost US$2.99.\nBy the way, I googled iphone 5 app 60fps video and it was the 2nd link. You might find other options this way as well.\n\nA: I know this used to be possible under either iOS 5 or 6 on my iPHONE4. What you can do now is use another app which increases quality of the video/photo due to compression features which of course is still under the app's control and not iOS.\n", "Q: Why I can't upgrade my Mac Pro OS X 10.7 to a more recent version? Why I can't upgrade my Mac Pro OS X 10.7 to a more recent version?\nMy system specs are:\nMacPro1,1 , Processor 2 x 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon, Ram 6 GB 667 GHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMM, Graphic Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT 512 MB, Serial Number C074200V08S  \nSystem Software: OS X Lion 10.7 (11A511)\n\nA: As indicated here, the last officially supported system software is Mac OS X 10.7.5.\nAny later system (10.8-10.10) is not running on your Mac and you won't be able to upgrade.\nHere (english) or here (german) you'll find a hack/workaround to get Yosemite running on your MacPro1,1, if it doesn't contain a 7300GT or X1900XT video card (which is true in your case because your Mac contains a GeForce 8800 GT). \n", "Q: Yosemite installation failure: hard drive can't be repaired I tried to upgrade from Mac OS X 10.7 to OS X 10.10.3.

Huge investment for me.\nYesterday night i tried charging i for the first time, and it started tingling against the palms of my hands whenever i like moved it across the under-keyboard area. I've read a lot about it, and i've read that it's normal, and that i have to use a three plug charger - the problem is that in Denmark we dont use three plug chargers, so i really dont know what to do! I just can't believe that i've saved so many money for so long, and that I experience problems after less than 12 hours.. ugh.\nHope you can help me. \n\nA: In Denmark you have 2 types of wall plug.\nBoth have ground connection. \nThe left one is standard European type and it has two ground connection showing as springs. Your Apple plug should just fit in that one.\nI am assuming the socket it is actually connected to the ground in your place.\n\n", "Q: recovering erased hard drive with Testdisk Recently I have accidently erased my harddrive with all my old mac files on it, and I have been trying desperatley to get it back.\nI have tried EaseUS recovery program and it has found my files (thank heaven!) but it asks to pay to recover these files.\nAfter looking through and through, I've found testdisk, and followed the instructions to get an image copy of my hard drive. It had a similar size, which I believe is my files!\nBuut this is the problem. It's compressed as a .dd file, and after a little research it seems to be an old UNIX compression file.\nIs there any way to open this file to get my lovely stuff back?\n\nA: An image copy (what you did with testdisk) is a block-level clone of your drive, not a file copy. it includes the directory, which does not include any of your files.\nEaseUS, Data Rescue and similar programs can usually recover files from a formatted drive. Yes, they cost money so get out your credit card. Some have a preview mode that can recover a small number of files per scan, basically to prove it's worth investing in.\nEaseUS costs $90, you apparently don't think your data is worth that much. Decent external drives cost about $200, a backup would have eliminated the headache you are going through. And there's more to come, as recovered files typically don't have the original filenames.\nAlso note that if you are talking about the disk drive in the computer you are currently using, the chances of recovering anything go down every minute you continue to use the computer. \n\nA: Because what you have used is free edition of EaseUS, the free edition for EaseUS support recover 2GB, if your files is more than 2GB, you have to pay for it.\n", "Q: I'm a little confused about my disk utlliization My daisy disk shows my disk utilisation like this. I have a 128 gb disk. Why does it show as ~72gb.\n\nA: The number after \"Macintosh HD\" and in the centre of the circle in your image is how much space on the disk is used - not the entire capacity of the disk. Clicking an area in the chart will navigate into that folder and show you how much space that folder is taking on your drive.\nIf you go back to the start view by clicking \"Disks and Folders\" you will see the actual capacity of each disk.\n", "Q: Why is my BASH script being executed twice?

I'd first look at launchctl list and then ps to see if SleepWatcher is running two instances. If not, then  I'd point the finger at SleepWatcher calling the on-wake script twice.\nUnless you want to dig into SleepWatcher's source, you will need to make your script resilient to multiple calls. Maybe touching a lock file at the beginning of execution and removing it some seconds after completion? Your script would then check for the existence of this lock file and abort if it exists.\nPS: I'd put your wakeup.rc file somewhere in the user's home folder, not in system-wide /etc because it's a user-level launchd agent, not a root-level one. Maybe ~/mysecureview/.wakeup.\n\nA: I had this problem, but fixed it with the following commands in Terminal:\n$ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist\n$ sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher.plist\n\n", "Q: How to set a text as a footer with Pages? I woudld like to set a footer on my page, in order to make some annotation, like this picture.\n\nI would like to make something like the number 3.\nI am using Pages from Mac OS X :)\n\nA: The feature you are looking for are the footnotes/endnotes\n\nA document can contain footnotes, which appear at the bottom of the\n  page, or endnotes, which appear at the end of the document or a\n  section. You can’t have both footnotes and endnotes in the same\n  document, but you can convert all notes in the document from one type\n  to another.\nBy default, footnotes and endnotes are numbered continuously\n  throughout the document with Arabic numerals, but you can change this\n  formatting.\nYou can also restyle the text used within the note. For example, you\n  can italicize or underline a book title within the note.\nUse the Footnotes pane of the Format inspector to format footnotes and\n  endnotes.\n\n\n\nInsert a footnote, endnote, or section endnote\n  The first time you\n  insert a note, it’s a footnote by default.

I'm having severe performance troubles when I'm using the laptop's built in screen as opposed to an external display. \nWhenever I stop using the external display, many of the OSX animations become slow and choppy.\nI suspect what's happening is that my external display always uses the discrete graphics card for acceleration. I also sometimes work quite close to the limit of my physical RAM. This probably makes it hard for my integrated graphics card to work efficiently.\nAny suggestions on how to force this machine to use the discrete graphics card EVEN when not using an external monitor?\nSpecs below:\n\nModel Name: MacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier:   MacBookPro10,1\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed:    2,3 GHz\n  Number of\n  Processors:   1\n  Total Number of Cores:  4\n   L2 Cache (per Core):   256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 6 MB\n  Memory: 8 GB\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 650M\nIntel HD Graphics 4000\n\n\nA: To force the usage of the discrete graphics card in your macbook you can uncheck the automatic graphics switching checkbox in the system preferences/ energy saver panel \n\nAs the message states, this does drain the battery faster.\nHowever, your mac should not behave as you describe, I suggest taking it to a service desk so apple can take a look at it, or call apple to ask why it is so choppy.\n", "Q: Can I get bootcamp to use existing free space on physical disk? When I installed my Macbook Pro, I had a 1Tb drive. When I formatted and partitioned the drive, I assigned 800Gb for OSX and left 200Gb free. I intended the free 200Gb to hold a Windows installation at a later date.\nWell, the later date has come, and Boot Camp Assistant wants to partition my drive with 780Gb for OSX and 20Gb for Windows. Clearly it's planning to resize my logical OSX partition down and create a new partition for Windows 7.\nIs there some way to get Boot Camp Assistant to instead use the free space on the drive I reserved for this purpose? Perhaps use Disk Utility to format that free space for Windows 7 before running Boot Camp Assistant? If so, what sort of file system should I create?\nSome more details: from running diskutil, I see that my disk0 is a 1TB drive partitioned into a 200MB EFI partition, an 800GB LVM partition, a 650MB recovery partition, and 200GB of unused space. The 800GB LVM partition is a physical volume containing a single 800GB logical volume mounted as disk1. Clearly, Boot Camp Assistant is trying to repartition this LVM physical volume rather than the actual disk0.\n\nA: More people have problems with BootCamp trying to partition manually than any other way. This is what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode.\n\n*Get into disk utility\n\n*Delete the partition you created for Windows\n\n*Expand your Mac partition all the way into the available space\n\n*Now (assuming you already have the BootCamp media created) Run the BootCamp.app and follow the prompts\n\n*Part of the process will present you with a graphical representation of your disk and allow you to set as much space as you want for both the Mac and Windows partition.\n\n\nThe thing you have to learn (or un-learn as the case may be) coming from Linux or Windows is that the first thing you should do is nothing. Let the App and/or Operating System do it's thing the way it wants to. Which means things like, \"just plug it in,\" \"follow the prompts in the app,\" or as a last resort read the (usually brief) instructions in the app or on Apple's support web site.\nI've been supporting Macs and PCs for 20+ years and it is a whole different mindset. Yes you can tinker, it's just a different method. What you did is not wrong, it just adds unnecessary complications making it necessary to then work around Apple's work-around that they build into BootCamp so you would not have to do all the partitioning manually.\n", "Q: Is it advisable to replace the internal HDD of an old Mac mini by a Solid State Drive? I have an old Mac mini 1.1 updated 2.1 (2.0Ghz CPU/4 GB RAM).\nMy problem:\nFlash videos use all CPU resources and my Mac gets very hot. \nMy question is: Is it advisable to buy a Solid State Drive and put it in and use it or is it time to sell my Mac mini?\nCan someone please upload a video showing a working Mac mini with an SSD? How does Flash on it and an app stress test. \n\nA: Since the decoding of Flash videos primarily stresses CPU and depending on the codec and the video card the GPU an SSD doesn't help much (assumed you have enough RAM).\nAnother caveat is the internal HD Interface of the Mac mini 1.1/2.1: Serial ATA (1.5 Gb/s) which roughly equals to a max. throughput of 150 MB/s. Modern SSDs provide up to 600 MB/s / 500 MB/s (read / write). As a consequence you will lose up to 2/3 of the possible bandwidth by attaching the SSD to your internal interface.\nSo better save the money and get a more recent Mac.\n\nA: Agreed, Flash is a big bag of hurt and an SSD likely won't help those specific problems. But adding an SSD to any computer will give it a substantial boos in speed.\n", "Q: I deleted every mail on my iPhone - but why does Mail still eat up my memory? I deleted every single mail from Mail.app on iOS 8.3 (inbox, sent, trash). However, Mail still occupies 798 MB for \"mails and attachments\" according to the memory overview. How can I clear this memory?\n\nA: According to OS X Daily, you can try removing the account from the mail app and adding it again. Source\n\nA: Tetsujin is correct, backup the phone, then go into settings -> general -> reset and erase all settings and data. Then restore the phone from the backup you just created. The available space should be better.\nOne thing I learned a couple of years ago and not sure if it still applies. If you do a hard reset (Sleep and home buttons pressed until the phone reboots) three times in a row, IOS will do some rather intensive cleanup and file system checks after the 3rd reboot. That might help. Not sure but it is quicker than backup/restore and won't hurt a thing.\n\nA: Go to iTunes and try to buy or rent a movie with more memory needs than your device has available OR just go to TV app and try to download a movie you already own that is larger than the space you have available.  You will be informed you do not have enough memory, and this will clear memory caches, especially email ones, freeing up more memory.  This method increased my memory available from 780MB to 2GB  \n", "Q: Is Apple MacBook Pro compatible with the LG LED PG60g projector? Recently I bought an LG portable LED PG60g projector. What cables would i need to connect them and get started?\n\nA: If your MacBook Pro has a HDMI connection, you just need an HDMI cable. (The current MacBook Pro's have built in HDMI.)\nIf you don't have built in HDMI You need a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter and a HDMI cable. (If you have a ThunderBolt port, this can be used as a Mini DisplayPort connection)\nYou could could also us a Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter. This will work for most applications and presentations. However, VGA will run into issues with rights managed video. DVD's, iTunes and many other video streaming services will not be allowed to display on a VGA connection.\nIf you actually have the new MacBook (non-Pro) with the USB-C connector, you will need a USB-C to HDMI adapter. \n", "Q: Multi-view PDF reader (support for multiple screen views) I have two screens connected to my mac, and I would like to see different pages of the same PDF on each screen. Does Preview support this? If not, what alternatives do I have in OS X?\n\nA: I am not aware of any PDF viewer which can have the same document open in two windows. \nA workaround would be to use Acrobat for the main work, and Preview for \"reference\", accepting that Preview may not have write rights for the document.\n", "Q: name of my secondary iCloud email account I have set up an email account on iCloud on our shared macbook but when I send a message it comes up with my wife's name (primary account) and then my email address(secondary).   This is for work and I need my own separate account without her name being attached to it.  Does anyone know how I do this?\n\nA: You should be able to change your name when you log in to 'manage my apple ID' and explore the options down the left hand side: https://appleid.apple.com\n", "Q: Password reset issue using terminal method No user accounts are displayed in the window that pops up after I enter the 'resetpassword' command into the terminal. \nIs there another way to reset my admin password or fix this issue?\n\nA: A wire connecting the hard drive was loose. \n", "Q: Does taking keys off of a MacBook keyboard void warranty I have some friends that try turning my MacBook Pro off (I always do it back to them if they do :) ).\nMy question is to make it harder for them to do that I could remove the power button key from my Mac. Would this void the warranty or not? I want to know this because I got AppleCare and do not want to waste that money\n\nA: Assuming you signed the AppleCare plan on the US, this is what the legal document states:\n\n4. What is not Covered?\n(ii) Damage caused by (…) (b) accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external cause, (c) operating the Covered Equipment outside the permitted or intended uses described by the manufacturer, or (d) service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a representative of Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”);\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but abuse and misuse may be applied to removing keys.\nYou may get away with it if you present it as an \"upgrade\", and you are an Apple Authorized Service Provider :)\n\nA: Generally you can do anything to your Apple device as long as the Apple Genius/tech cant see evidence of what was done. Which means that If popping off key caps and then putting them back on leaves no trace you are likely safe.\nAnd I mean no trace. You would be surprised what an Apple genius/technician will find that you never noticed. \nAnd third party replacements totally count as evidence of \"tampering.\" So if you put a 3rd party SSD (or RAM, or whatever) in the Mac, put the Apple branded part back in before you take it in to Apple as they will take it out and say they can't and won't support non-Apple parts.\n", "Q: Yosemite Activity Monitor: '% CPU' column blank for certain processes (clang compiler) I have been a bit confused recently when installing some software updates using MacPorts. Some of the packages required compilation, and as expected the CPU usage (and fans) went up, as indicated in the CPU load graph in the attached screenshot.\nHowever, when I looked into the Activity Monitor for the CPU usage of clang (which was the main activity at that point as verified by MacPorts' verbose diagnostic output), it showed up with blank %CPU usage. Other processes showed up just normally, as did some other MacPorts related processes. I checked also in the shell activity monitor 'top' and it showed clang at 0% CPU usage, even when run in Superuser mode using sudo.\nIs this normal behaviour?\nWhy would this happen?\nIs there another way of seeing the real CPU usage? \nShould I be worried that I might have some kind of root kit installed? This messing with the displayed properties of running tasks would -- to my knowledge -- be a possible indication for something like this going on.\n\n\nA: I have found that sometimes processes can spawn and die so fast that Activity Monitor has trouble keeping up, and doesn't manage to get all the information displayed in time. It isn't a major issue, and it is a normal behavior, if a somewhat incorrect one.\n", "Q: Can I block incoming calls using wildcard patterns? Recently I have been getting a few unwanted telemarketing calls, all coming from the same source. Each number though is different at the end.\nFor instance, if the numbers to be blocked are: \n\n\n*\n\n*123-4567\n\n*123-7642\n\n*123-8643\n\n\nIt would be convenient for the future to simply block with a wildcard, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*123-*\n\n\nIs this at all possible?\n\nA: There is now an API for applications to block and annotate incoming calls. There isn't a native interface. So, you would need to find an app that does this on the App Store. Or, find an open source project, compile it in Xcode and use your AppleID to install the app onto your personal devices.\nOne review covering this category is:\n\n*\n\n*New call-blocking apps in iOS 10 can stop spammers and scammers before they reach you\nThe major US carriers are also starting to identify spoofed caller ID. So, you would want to check with your cellular carrier to tighten up which calls and information they send in the first place to the iPhone. Once you’re set there, look at a call screening app that meets your specific needs. The good ones cost money to develop. So, if you are running a free app or don’t understand how they pay their bills, double check if they instead sell your call or location data to fund the app.\n\nA: I've developed an app called Number Shield (99¢) that blocks calls by allowing you to enter a wildcard for certain digits in the phone number.  It's available here:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/number-shield/id1319082167?ls=1&mt=8\nIt has a limit of 7 wildcards per number pattern and a total of 50,000,000 numbers blocked.  These restrictions are due to limitations in the way the iPhone's call blocking system works.\n(Yes, this is a bit of shameless self-promotion, but it certainly answers the question.)\n\nA: Try Blacklist and Blacklist Pro by Sergey Smirnov, and Ad & Call Blocker 2 in 1 by Codefavor.\nBlacklist (free) allows one range of numbers.\nBlacklist Pro ($1.99) allows multiple ranges of numbers.\nAd & Call Blocker 2 in 1 is 1.99.\n\nA: This app claims to do just that. I am about to try it but figured I'd share what I found.\nhttps://apps.apple.com/ca/app/number-shield/id1319082167\n\n\n\n\nA: WideProtect is a pretty simple app for exactly this purpose\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/wideprotect/id1171024059\nIt allows for specifying a wildcard pattern to block numbers, like 609-***-****. At the minimum it requires the first three digits so you should be able to block entire states with this.\n\nA: Yes, that is possible with Call Protect (NOT AT&T Call Protect) app’s range-blocking feature. This app is available here for FREE: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-protect/id1357820531?mt=8.\nSo, how to block a range of numbers using Call Protect?\nLaunch the app > Go to Block tab > Tap on Block a Number button > Select Block a Range of Numbers option > Enter the starting and ending numbers of the range.\nPlease note that you have an option to whitelist the numbers from your contacts, so the numbers in your contacts do not get blocked. I have found this app pretty useful so far and recommend it to you.\n\nA: For ios, to block all numbers .... 123-456-7891\n\n\n*\n\n*To block all numbers beginning  with 123-456,\n A) Make new contact with number entered as\n123-456-****\n B) block that contact\n\n*To block all numbers beginning 123-45,\n  A) make contact and block wih number entered as\n       123-45*-****\nDo you see pattern?\n\nA: CALL Protect is a free application by ATT for ATT users. \nThis app works great for reported numbers but does not protect against “wildcard” bot calls that switch the last four digits of your own exchange. \nThere are several other apps that work for this listed on this page. \n\nA: Begone is free and works for this: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/begone-call-blocker/id1596818195\n", "Q: I cant open my iPad mini!

I dont want all my videos, and pictures to be deleted... plss helpp\n\nA: Connect your iPad to a Mac or PC using the iTunes application. Try to make a backup from there; if that worked, restore the iPad to factory defaults (that basically erases everything that's on it) and restore the backup you just made.\nFor the future: Make a backup regularly, or you will lose your data some day.\n", "Q: German keyboard Alt-D gives '∂' - how can I disable it? It should be an easy thing to do if I only could find out how to change the symbol (e.g. from ∂ to € or so) - but as a programmer with a lot of shortcuts this is the only thing that keeps doubting me, if a Mac is the right choice.\nIt's a 10.10.3; I'm using Intellij and Emacs.\nBtw: the same happens for lots of other keys (€®†Ω¨⁄øπ•œ@∆ºª) - this makes the alt-key almost useless.\n\nA: The Alt key on the Mac is used differently than on Windows. Its main use is exactly what you see: To enter special (\"alternate\") characters.\nMenu shortcuts and such are always triggered by a Command-key (\"⌘\") combo (sometimes including other modifier keys, such as the Alt key). For example, closing all open windows in Finder is [Cmd]-[Alt]-[W].\n", "Q: Unlock iPhone 5 help I have an iPhone 5 through Virgin Mobile USA. They say cannot unlock it due to \"not having the technology\", they say they can only unlock iPhone 5c and 5s. They did however give me the code which is useless because I don't know how to do it.\nIs there a way to unlock it myself using the code? I tried going to a different carrier, but the iPhone gave the \"SIM is invalid\" error so I had to transfer my number back to Virgin Mobile after the other account was active. \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nSprint will not do anything for me either.\nTried bringing it to some places no one could do it.\n\nA: The flowchart on unlocking an iPhone (no matter what model or what carrier) is here. If you're having problems with Customer Support with a specific carrier. List the exact words you used to request the unlock and consider getting them to explain exactly what the issue is.\nHold their feet politely to the fire if they are not supporting you as a customer. You will need to be responsible for being clear with them and listening to exactly what they say so they don't \"snow\" you with irrelevant information. Once you share with them the exact steps you are undertaking (linked below) they will have no where to hide except to admit if they will or will not unlock the device.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201328\n\nA: One method that has proven to be safe and effective for unlocking your iPhone 5 or 5s is Network Unlocking. Companies have IMEI codes as unique identifiers for their phones. There is a listing of each iPhone’s model number, memory size, color, and production date. This list also tells whether the iPhone is locked to a certain network or not.\nAn IMEI Network Unlock will get your iPhone’s IMEI lock status changed so that it is unlocked. This means that you won’t have to have some unauthorized person bothering the hardware and wiring in your phone. There is also no software download needed. https://macback.us/tutorials/how-to-unlock-iphone-5-5s/\n", "Q: Delete personal gmail from work iPad I don't have a delete button when I go to Settings, choose  Calendars, etc. then my gmail account I want to delete on my work iPad. I see only a sign-out option. Do I have to have my work delete my personal gmail account since they are the main account holder.\n\nA: If you go into settings -> mail, Contacts, Calendars all of your accounts should be listed there. (Your question does not mention that specific location, did you go there?) Tap on the one you want to delete and scroll to the bottom of the screen. There should be an option to to remove the account.\nDepending on how the iPad was set up at work they may have some sort of MDM installed that prevents you from doing a number of things, including adding or removing accounts and apps, changing certain settings and the like. If that is the case you may have to talk with your IT people to do what you want to do.\n", "Q: RMBP outputs 4k@60Hz ONLY when lid open I've got a weird problem. I recently got a new Philips BDM4065UC UHD monitor for my Late 2013 15\" retina MBP (it's amazing), connected it using DisplayPort 1.2 (also set on the display) and when using both the built-in display and the external screen, everything works amazing, the image is butter smooth at full resolution and 60Hz.\nHowever, when I try to use my MacBook in closed clamshell mode (the screen is ridiculously huge, there's no point in using the built-in screen and there's not much space on my desk), it switches back to 30Hz. WTF?\nI mean I would understand it the other way, but this just doesn't make sense. Is there some setting I'm missing? Since I'm not using the screen I'd like to use all the video memory for the external screen.\n\nA: Solved!\nThe solution is about as weird as the problem. To enable 60Hz in clamshell mode, I had to Option-click the \"Scaled\" radio button on System preferences' Display resolution screen, then the Refresh Rate option became available and I could switch from 30 to 60Hz. For some reason it wasn't enabled by default when lid closed.\nEDIT: Also found out that for some reason this issue is directly connected to my old USB hub. When the display is connected and working at 60Hz clamshell mode, just touching the computer surface with the USB connector lights up a small white spark and the display immediately switches to 30Hz and the option disappears. And this ONLY happens when the lid is closed.\nThis is easily the most interesting problem I've had with a mac in many years.\n*throws the USB hub to trash immediately*\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue and I tried to change resolution and refresh rate by clicking \"Scaled\". The problem was that it was showing just 5 images to select the size of text and not resolution numbers with Refresh Rate drop box. You have to hold the Option key and click “Scaled” to see them.\nI hope this helps you the same way it helped me.\n", "Q: Cleaning off packages installed via Terminal on OSX I have been learning to use Terminal to install packages (particularly to learn Ruby development). I believe that I'm experiencing some conflicts with things that have been installed and would like to remove them. The issue is, during my trial and error, forgot everything that was installed. \nQUESTION:\nIs there a way to list out anything that has been installed through Terminal? And what is the best way to remove those items? I assume they need to be uninstalled individually or I would have to a complete reset for OSX.\nAny guidance would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: I can only speak for Homebrew but I would imagine the other utilities you used should have similar options. With Homebrew you can list everything installed by Homebrew with brew list. After this you can remove installed applications using brew remove <application-name>. Homebrew should have installed everything in /usr/local/Cellar/. I would recommend checking out the official FAQ to learn how to uninstall Homebrew altogether. I know this doesn't cover all of the tools you used but I hope it helps at least a little bit. \n", "Q: How to install, specific version of Java by command line on Mac? It's Possible?

On some Android keyboards (for example), the main display is a full QWERTY keyboard with numbers or symbols under the letters. You can either press directly on a letter to type it, or swipe down on the letter to type the associated number/symbol. This allows you to enter numbers/symbols much faster than if you had to switch to a separate numbers/symbols pane. Is there any third-party iOS keyboard with this functionality?\n\nA: FancyKey by Pinssible Labs allows for this, and is the best replacement keyboard for iOS I've used. Setup is simple, and turning on Swype is as easy as switching to the FancyKey Keyboard, tapping the gear icon, and tapping the \"Swipe input\" switch on. Your keyboard with default to the custom keyboard until you change it by tapping the globe icon.\n\nA: Not exactly what you are asking, but the MessagEase keyboard from Exideas allows you to type numbers by holding down the corresponding virtual key. The keyboard itself is a 3x3 swipe keyboard where each \"button\" naturally corresponds to a number.\n\nThe image shows me typing the number 3 by holding down my finger on the i symbol.\n(You can switch to an explicit number keypad by tapping the 123 symbol on the right.)\nSwiping diagonally between two \"keys\" selects the corresponding symbol, and a tap on one of the keys selects its main symbol. This makes much better use of the limited real estate on a small mobile screen, and is much more generous with how precisely you have to position your fingers. It obviously takes a while to learn (in my case I would estimate maybe three weeks, but it was many years ago that I switched over).\nIt's still somewhat imprecise; I find myself producing an e instead of a space a lot, and some swipe combinations are slightly unergonomical (left parentesis can be a drag, and I kept writing \"nurber\" a lot above); but I would estimate that it has reduced my keyboard swearing by 80%.\nUnfortunately, the keyboard seems to crash several times per day, and the authors no longer seem to respond to support emails or their Twitter. Still, I never want to switch back to the QWERTY keyboard on my phone.\n", "Q: How can I get OS X El Capitan and watchOS and iOS 9 without being a developer?

If I have Optimize iPhone Storage enabled on my iPhone and my phone storage is completely full, I understand that iOS will only store a low-res thumbnail of many of my photos on the device. (The full high-res version of the image will only exist in iCloud and on devices with Download and Keep Originals enabled.)\nBut when only thumbnails exist on the device, how does that work in relation to other photo apps on iOS? For example, do third-party cloud-based photo apps (like Google Photos, Dropbox's Carousel, or Amazon Prime Photos) have access to the full high-res images from the iCloud Photo Library? Or will they only see the low-res thumbnails in some cases?\n\nA: It depends on where the app is pulling images from. If you have selected \"Optimize iPhone storage\" then these apps will only have access to the lower-resolution thumbnails, as bmike pointed out (they use Camera Roll). \nUnless the app is specifically coded to pull photos from iCloud Photo Libary (which Apple currently supports), they will just have access to the low-resolution photos stored locally on the device.\nAll the apps you have mentioned access your Camera Roll, therefore the low-resolution images.\n", "Q: What's the difference between iTunes Match and Apple Music? I currently pay for iTunes Match which gets me advertisement free streaming as well as a unified, cloud backed iTunes Library.\nI don't understand how those existing features work with or against the newly announced Apple Music subscription service.\nIs the former discontinued or credited to the new service or are they complimentary and optional to pay for either A or B or both?\n\nA: They're two different services according to Apple: http://www.apple.com/music/membership/\nThe relevant text is:\n\nDoes Apple Music work with iTunes Match?\n  Yes. Apple Music and iTunes Match are independent but complementary\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/\niTunes Match brings your iTunes library to the Cloud, so all your music (until 25k songs) on your iTunes Library (including unknown songs, like your friend's demos) are loaded and available on the cloud and you can listen them everywhere you're on all your linked devices downloading them instantly.\nApple Music is like Spotify; so you can listen all music distributed from Apple unlimitedly as you bought and download it to your various devices running watchOS, iOS, OS X and Android. (presumably iTunes on windows will be included later?)\nThey didn't talk of iTunes Radio so it's not clear if the value or pricing there will be increased, decreased or changed.\nUPDATE: Reading on lot of sector sites, seems that Apple Music will include iTunes Match but I can't find any official confirmation...\n\nA: Oldish question now but Apple now have a good overview of the main differences here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204962\nTo summarise: Apple Music and iTunes Match both give you an \"iCloud Music Library\" which can be populated in one of three ways: with music matched from your original local music collection, with music uploaded from your collection if iTunes cannot find a match and if you have Apple Music, with music from the a Apple Music library. \nSo in short, Apple Music alone contains all the functionality of iTunes Match with the only difference being the way that DRM is applied. \nWith iTunes Match, all music added to your library either via matching or upload is DRM free. Uploaded files can be downloaded on other devices in their original format and matched songs in DRM free 256kbps AAC. \nWith Apple Music, any uploaded files remain in their original DRM free form but any matched songs, or music added from the Apple Music library, can only be downloaded on other devices with DRM and will only work while you have a subscription. \nFinally, iTunes Match can still complement your Apple Music subscription because if you have both you will get your matched music DRM free though it should go without saying that Apple Music content will still have DRM even with a Match subscription. \nHopefully that's clear!\n\nA: The difference is DRM (Apple music) vs DRM-Free music (iTunes Match).\n\nA: Actually, the Apple Music membership page says that service brings your iTunes library to iCloud, too \n\n\nIt does say Apple Music and iTunes Match are \"independent but complementary,\" but I think I'm like you — I can't figure out why I'd want iTunes Match if I'm paying for Apple Music. \nThe only benefit of Match is the $2 a month price point over the $10 a month price point. Music appears to do everything Match did but better and more and is priced accordingly.\n\nA: It seems that Apple Music will match all of your existing music and back up any music that can't be matched. It also gives you unlimited skipping to \"Apple Music radio stations.\" I was confused.\nFrom my understanding, Apple Music is basically Beats Music and iTunes Match rolled into one.\n\nA: iTunes music will add DRM to the songs you upload and then download.\n\nA: I think I get it.\nApple Music includes Match and its capabilities (license shouldn't be different, if labels already allow adding songs from iTunes Store to collection, why not add essentially the same music to your collection by upload? Adding a Maroon 5 CD is like adding a Maroon 5 album from iTunes), and for the upload of tracks not on iTunes, well it's a pretty small ~10MB of data for Apple which it can afford as part of 10$ a month. \nRegarding the independent and complementary: Apple Music and iTunes Match will be kept separate subscriptions. They can work simultaneously together(complementary). That means if you don't want Apple Music and only Match, you can do it. If you get Music, you get Match too.\nHopefully I'm right and this can simplify my subscriptions, from Spotify, Match and Pandora :/\n", "Q: WWDC 2015 Event's Live Stream At the beginning of WWDC opening Keynote Tim Cook spoke about \"more than 40 event of WWDC streamed live to everybody for the first time\".\nCan someone found something more about this?\nA page with schedules an link to events?\n\nA: Apple TV has an Apple Events channel with what appears to be all of the live streamed events and no requirement to have a developer account.

After setting up some basics, installing Photoshop, JRE, XAMPP and NetBeans, i started to use the machine a bit, doing some basic coding.\nWhile using Netbeans, the fans rev up in an abnormal fashion. Of course i checked the CPU usage in Activity Monitor, but nothing abnormal showed up - merely just 7%-10% usage varying. There was simply nothing running, that would use up the CPU. I have owned a 2014 model previously and it never showed such behaviour. In fact, unless NetBeans was scanning a huge project and the CPU usage went up to 100%+, the fans were not even noticeable at all.\nWhat i tried\nAfter some research, i reset the SMC, but the issue remained. Instead of working flawlessly, after resetting the SMC and rebooting the machine, then running it for a few minutes and then opening apple.stackexchange.com in Google Chrome, suddenly the entire screen turned white and the only thing that was still there was the mouse pointer, which i could move around, but otherwise the machine was unresponsive.\nI rebooted and checked the log, which under System Diagnostic Reports now showed a file prefixed with Kernel which said:\nEvent: GPU Reset\nApplication: WindowServer\nOS Version: Mac OS X Version 10.10.3 (Build 14D2134)\nGraphics Hardware: AMD Radeon R9 M370X\nSignature: 0\n\nFollowed by a huge chunk of dump data.\nSadness fills my being.\nCould this be a hardware issue? Badly applied cooling paste?

Back things up and wipe it. Then run the iLife apps like garage band and iMovie and Photos to soak the CPU.\nEverything in my experience is you have some software issues that aren't ready for the new API and new CPU/GPU and will have occasional panics as the drivers get updated for non-apple users or the non-apple code gets patched to behave properly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe is notorious for needing a patch for new HW.\n\n*JRE, XAMPP, NetBeans - would depend heavily on your versions\n\n*Apple offer free hardware support - why not get them to check things and let you know. Run sysdiagnose each time you get a panic so you have all the diagnostic logs saved if you end up with some pattern of 10 or more KP so that engineering can analyze things. If you have less than a dozen crashes or can't make it happen, realize that you'll likely need to pay someone to analyze those diagnostics as it's time consuming and requires fairly specialized experience to make headway on non-reproducible core dumps and panics.\n\n", "Q: iOS 8: Prevent Safari Mobile from reloading tabs by default When switching between tabs in Safari Mobile -- Even within a few seconds -- Safari will automatically reload the tab. \nThis will happen more frequently between sessions: Switching between Safari Mobile to another app and back will cause every open page (\"tab\") to reload. \nNot long ago, I found a tutorial explaining how to prevent Safari Mobile from reloading tabs while browsing that involved plugging in the iPhone, and making use of Safari Desktop's Development Web Inspector, similar to the method viewable in this tutorial: http://appletoolbox.com/2014/05/use-web-inspector-debug-mobile-safari/\nTo prevent the Mobile app from reloading tabs by default. However, the above tutorial is only for troubleshooting how a specific webpage appears on the iPhone, and I can no longer find the tutorial to prevent Safari from reloading all tabs each session.\nSolutions tried have included: \nClosing all other apps\nClearing History and Website Data\nRestart\nChanging Settings > Safari > Open Links from \"In Background\" to \"In New Tab\"\nResetting Network Settings\nClearing available storage space \nReset All Settings\nRestore phone from backup\nTabs still reload. This is commonly attributed on the Apple Support and other threads I have read to \"Memory Issues\" or default behavior for \"Memory Allocation\":\nhttp://forums.imore.com/ios-8/302019-safari-stop-reloading-my-pages.html\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sick-of-safari-reloading-pages.1807865/\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2gv2rb/does_ios_8_fix_the_constant_tab_reloads_in_safari/\nYet pages are visible and usable in the tab immediately after switching, but then reload anyway. Not good in poor coverage areas. \nIs anyone aware of a true solution to prevent this automatic reloading behavior in Safari Mobile? \n\nA: As you have read, this is down to memory management. iOS will remove background tabs from memory when that memory is required for something else. The device you're using is more significant than the version of iOS. An iPhone 6 with 1GB of RAM will close tabs more aggressively than an XS with 4GB.\nAs others have mentioned in the comments, iOS keeps a thumbnail of the page in memory so that you know which tab is which. This thumbnail requires much less memory than a full web page rendering context.\nReclaiming memory used by inactive apps/tabs is actually a feature. You wouldn't wan't an app to fail to launch because your phone is out of memory, so iOS automatically makes space for it. For the same reason it's not necessary to \"close\" apps, as iOS will remove apps from memory when necessary.\nApple doesn't include RAM in the specs published for iOS devices, but wikipedia has a handy summary of iOS device specs. \n", "Q: Playstation 4 on a Thunderbolt display? Is there any way at all that I could connect a Playstation 4 to a Thunderbolt display?\n\nA: No. You can't connect a Thunderbolt display to it.

I would like to prevent the text wrap in OSX Terminal, by letting text to continue under the border.\nI could not find it in Preferences of the terminal. \nHow can you prevent text wrap in OSX Terminal?\n\nA: Not really a Terminal.app bug, but rather part of the terminfo entries which describe various terminals and their features (like xterm-256color, the Terminal.app default).\nFrom man terminfo:\nVariable String Capname  TCap Code Description\nenter_am_mode   smam     SA        turns on automatic margins\nexit_am_mode    rmam     RA        turns off automatic margins\n\nTry tput rmam then the commands you want. This should turn off auto wrapping.\ntput smam sets automatic margins back to the default for terminal entries with the \"am\" or \"automatic-right-margin\" capability.\nless doesn't seem to deal well with long lines after tput rmam, use the option -S or --chop-long-lines instead.\nFor horizontal scrolling of the prompt line, see man bash under horizontal-scrolling-mode (off by default).\n\nA: This function doesn't exists in Terminal. It doesn't exist within xterm either. It might be really usefull to read log files with very long lines or output of commands as tcpdump. The wrapping render them unreadable.\nI suggest you to fill a feedback about this function on:\nMacOS X feedback\nTo make it a winning improvment proposal I suggest you to ask for an horizontal scrollbar so as to be able to display the text which is beyond the right border.\n\nA: This report is included here because Apple does not make these feature requests public by any means, organizing better the application of this proposal.\nI submitted the following feature request to Apple\n\n", "Q: Macvim crashing about hourly Any hints on stabilizing MacVim?

I have tried several things including restarting in Recovery Partition, going to terminal and typing \"resetpassword.\" This does pull up the standard screen that allows me to change the password, but then the volume containing the user account never shows up, which means I can't select it to change the password. I have also tried the older method of deleting the /var/db/.applesetupdone file through terminal, but it seems this file doesn't exist for v.10.10.2.

Once a clean Yosemite install is ready, you can migrate your user settings and data using Time Machine.\nClean Install OS X Yosemite\nIt’s time for a clean install. We’re going to show you how to do it without using a USB drive, which makes it much easier and less confusing. So to start, you should download OS X Yosemite from the Mac App Store. Once it’s finished downloading, it’ll immediately load up on your screen. Follow the instructions to install OS X Yosemite. Once it’s done, it’ll ask you to restart your Mac. Do it, and once it’s loaded up, we’ll start the clean install process:\n\n\n*\n\n*We’re going to restart your Mac again. But this time, hold down Cmd+R. (Keep holding it down while it restarts, do not let go)\n\n*Now, your Mac should load a screen with a few options (you can let go of Cmd+R now).\n\n*Select the Disk Utility option.\n\n*In the window, at the top of the left bar, select your Mac’s Main Drive. It should be something like MainHD.\n\n*Now, select the Erase tab, located next to the First Aid button at the top-center.\n\n*Near the center of the window, select the Format drop-down list and select “Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)” as the type.\n\n*Click Erase (this will erase your main drive!) and allow some time for the drive to format.\n\n*When it’s finished, close out Disk Utility and select “ReInstall OS X” from the menu. It will ask for your Mac App Store password to redownload OS X Yosemite. Give it a minute to do so.\n\n*A new window should pop up and OS X Yosemite should begin to install. If it does not, press back and enter your password again.\n\n*Once again, follow the install instructions and enjoy your newly clean-installed OS X Yosemite.\n\n\nAt this point, you'd migrate your Time Machine backup, and fingers crossed, you will have cleared the password problem.\n\nA: I don't have an answer to this issue, just an observation.\nI have observed this symptom on a number of freshly installed OS X 10.0.X systems.\nOn both occasions the systems worked fine until a restart was required after installing software from a package.  Both times the packages were simple printer drivers.\nBoth occasions occurred during a Mac Yosemite 10.10 Essentials training course.\nOn both occasions it was only possible to login in safe mode, verifying that the correct passwords were still known.  However the passwords would not work with a normal boot up.

But, maybe you can use the Message History option under the Messages app setting to your advantage.  Assuming you don't already have it set to 30 days, change Keep Messages and have iOS automatically get rid of a majority of your messages.

I foolishly uninstalled GCC 4.9 after brew upgradeing to GCC 5. However I need both versions and I need to be able to switch back and forth. I thought I could just do brew switch 4.9.2 but the old version of GCC was installed to the folder Cellar/gcc49/4.9.2 instead of Cellar/gcc/4.9.2, so Homebrew doesn't know where to find the old version.\nHow can I force Homebrew to install both versions in Cellar/gcc?\nThat is, I have:\nbrew list --versions gcc\n# gcc 5.1.0\nbrew list --versions gcc49\n# gcc49 4.9.2_1\n\nBut I'd like to have:\nbrew list --versions gcc\n# gcc 5.1.0 4.9.2_1\n\n\nA: You can’t, those are different formulae, and Homebrew doesn’t allow you to install a previous version of a formula.\nThe workaround is to remove gcc, then go back in Homebrew’s history (remember that it’s a Git repository), get the gcc formula as it was before the 5.1.0 upgrade, install it, then upgrade gcc to get the latest version.\nThe 5.1.0 gcc upgrade was done in Homebrew commit 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab:\n$ cd $(brew --prefix)\n$ git show -s 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab\ncommit 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab\nAuthor: David Christenson <david@the-david.com>\nDate:   Sat May 2 18:58:17 2015 -0600\n\n    gcc 5.1.0\n\n    Update to latest stable release, add option and patch for JIT, remove CLooG dependency,\n    refactor language selection, add HEAD, use HTTPS mirror.\n\nYou need to checkout the parent commit:\n$ git checkout 9cf3d4da1148c0a0d2f42c2fbe75f9a557339bab^\n\nThen get the gcc formula and save it somewhere:\n$ brew cat gcc > /tmp/gcc.rb\n\nIf you’re lazy I put this formula online here. You can now go Back to the Future:\n$ git checkout master\n\nBe sure you removed the current gcc:\n$ brew rm gcc\n\nNow install the 4.9 version, either from your local copy:\n$ brew install /tmp/gcc.rb\n\nOr from my online copy:\n$ brew install https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bfontaine/eacd18e2c413005a7526/raw/320a73fc6e1bbf0009a08e6bd90e9d32c3409007/gcc.rb\n\nYou should now have a working GCC 4.9 install.

I need to know how to get it installed.\n\nA: Any Mac built in the last 10 years comes with Apache and PHP installed and ready to go. All you need to do is run one command to start apache (apachectl start) and un-comment 1-2 lines in httpd.conf. installing massive packages that leave you with multiple copies is NOT necessary.\nIf you want a friendly interface and a box to check, get Apple's Server application.\n\nA: One method is to download MacPorts from https://www.macports.org/install.php. Once done, run the command sudo port selfupdate then sudo port install php56 (which means php5.6. Adapt that for whichever version you need). You can also type port search php56 (or whichever version you chose) to get a list of PHP packages available for that version.\n\nA: Laravel Homestead is what you need.\n\nLaravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant \"box\" that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable.

It is on software version 7.7.3 and has worked without issue until recently.\nProblem\nTwo days ago the performance of my AirPort Time Capsule's wifi dropped dramatically.  Whereas before I had no problem with AirPlay, or streaming videos stored on the Capsule over wifi, now videos buffer every few seconds, and AirPlay is chopped up to smithereens.  Web browsing is also noticeably slower, and file transfer speeds to and from the device have fallen through the floor.\nDiagnosis\nThe problem seemed to start a day or so after I added an HP Envy 5530 printer to my network, though this could just be a coincidence.\nTo get an idea of exactly how slow the wifi had become, I put my Mac directly next to the Capsule and timed copying a 2GB (16000Mb) file to and from the device:\n\n\n*\n\n*To: 390s ≈ 41Mbps\n\n*From: 527s ≈ 30Mbps\n\n\nBoth are less than a tenth of the theoretical maximum of 450Mbps reported when I alt-click the wifi icon in the top bar, so something is clearly amiss.\nTo isolate the wifi as the culprit, I connected my Mac to the Capsule over an Ethernet cable.  I then saw that videos streamed without issue, files transferred at reasonable speed, and web browsing returned to normal.\nTo isolate environmental interference and/or my Mac's wifi client as the problem, I took the Capsule into the office and repeated the transfer using a  360MB file on a Windows laptop.  The results were even worse than above:\n\n\n*\n\n*To: 88s ≈ 31Mbps\n\n*From: 136s ≈ 20Mbps\n\n\nHere is a screenshot from iStumbler taken at home while a slow file transfer was in progress.  The top two networks are mine (5GHz and 2.4GHz) and it shows there is no channel contention.  The transfer occurred around the middle 50% of the graph.\n\nRemedy\nI tried a few things to fix the problem, but with no luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ran Wireless Diagnostics but no problems were found.\n\n*Assigned the wifi channels manually to a few different random combinations.\n\n*Specified a different SSID for the 5GHz wifi and tried connecting through that.\n\n*Removed the HP software and deleted the printer from my Mac, and unplugged the printer from the wall.\n\n*Performed a factory reset of the Capsule.\n\n\nNext steps\nShort of returning the unit to Apple, is there anything else I should try?\n\nA: I finally found the problem. Quite inexplicably, it was caused by the latest update to Boom 2 (v1.2).  This introduced an option to use the Boom Remote iPhone app.  Even if you don't have the app, it's enabled by default in the interface.  Disabling it solves all issues: \n\nThere are plenty of other people are reporting the same thing on their forum, and the company has acknowledged the issue.\n\nA: Changing network parameters like channel assignments might cause more harm than good, especially on the long turm. You may end up in having to analyse strange issues...\nUse a professionnal tool to analyse your wireless environment first:\niStumbler.\nIf you want a professionnal help, please put a copy of a screen capture with this tool. Make this environmental measure at a point which is as near as possible from the point you want to communicate with your Time Capsule usually.\nTake care to make this measure at the hour you witness your slow network throughput.\nSort the output along decreasing signal level (Level column).\nTake care to hide private information from this screen capture.\nIf you have a real environmental problem (which a real and highly frequent situation), fix it.\nElse, bring back your Time Capsule to your Apple reseller. Most probably an antenna cable was not correctly fixed inside, and a move made it unplug.\n", "Q: Why is htop producing different reports than Activity Monitor? I'm using htop on my Mac.

I want to create an animation in Keynote for a proof of concept. So I create a custom 16:9 document with 1440 x 810 pixel size. Then I add an image with a 1440 x 6395 pixel size. When I first add the image it's downsized so that it doesn't stretch beyond the slide height, but I click the Original size to have it fill the width (and stretch beyond the height). \nThe problem now is that even though I've clicked Original size, I'm quite sure the image isn't actually its original size, at least not in resolution. \nWhen I set the presentation in full screen this is part of what I see:\n\nWhen I look at the same area of the image in Finder Preview this is what I see:\n\nSo you see, the image in Keynote is undoubtedly reduced in quality.\nDoes anyone know how I avoid this?\n\nA: After some research I found that this is a problem that has appeared since Keynote 6, and is probably due to iOS compatibility (limiting PNG original quality to stick up to 4096px height).\nA tip however was to import your image as PDF instead, then Keynote won't downsample it. \nHere's the result:\n\n", "Q: Cannot see my network on Windows 7 running under Parallels 10 I have 4 Sony laptops, a Seagate Central, 2 Wi-Fi printers and an iMac on my home network. The iMac running under OS X 10.10.3 can see all of the network devices using Finder. The laptops can see the iMac. BUT Windows on the iMac can only connect to the internet.

The machines are all networked via a Linksys XAC 1900 which works really well. I want to use the iMac as my #1 computer (it has more memory and disk than any of the laptops) but this network issue is making that impossible.\n\nA: Probably the virtual network interface of your Windows 7 VM uses \"Shared Network\". Reconfigure the NIC to bridged network and choose Ethernet or Wi-Fi (like indicated in the screenshot below) depending on your network configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*if your iMac is connected to the Linksys XAC 1900 via Ethernet choose \"Ethernet\"  \n\n*if your iMac is connected to the Linksys XAC 1900 via Wi-Fi choose \"Wi-Fi\"  \n\n\n\nYou might want to check the Firewall configuration in your Windows 7 VM as well.

Is there a list of officially supported Macs for OS X El Capitan?\nI ask to get ready if any hardware which is supported on Yosemite is not supported by El Capitan?\n\nA: If you care to read the tea leaves, the initial OS X v10.11 Developer Beta supports the following Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)\n\n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)\n\n*Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n\n*Xserve (Early 2009)\n\n\nSource: OS X v10.11 Developer Beta 1 Release Notes. \nNo official requirements are published by Apple. \nAbout your last question, no. There are no macs supported by Yosemite that are not supported by El Capitan.\n\nA: It's worth noting that every Mac that supports Mountain Lion (10.8) also supports Mavericks (10.9), Yosemite (10.10), and El Capitan Developer Beta 1 (10.11). System requirements in El Capitan are unlikely to change from those in the developer beta.\nHowever, some features might be unavailable on earlier systems.

Do you know what is the error 229 and why it's triggered?\n\nA: I found a solution: You need to download the ACS ACR122U Drivers for Mac OS X 10.x.\nHere the download page and the direct link for PC/SC Driver Installer 1.1.0 (Mac 10.5, Mac 10.6, Mac 10.7, Mac 10.8, Mac 10.9, Mac 10.10) (2014-09-17 306KB).\nYou have to install it even if the installer is not properly signed.\nIt will install the useful driver in: /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/ifd-acsccid.bundle\nNow you are able to use the card reader.\nIf you want to test it out, I made a simple project here.\n\nA: The problem with the above answer is that it doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.11.x, as SIP (System Integrity Protection) mechanism blocks any attempts to write to system directories such as /usr/libexec/...\nI found that the workaround proposed by Metsma here Re: el capitan 10.11.4 unable to see smartcard solved the problem of \"interface or token cannot be used (error 229)\" on 10.11.5. Also, once the right symlink was placed - I did not need to install any additional driver.

I guess the title says pretty much it all. I've added a folder I do most of my work in to Favorites in Finder. Sometimes however I need to back up in the folder structure to access a folder higher in the tree structure. However, when I've  accessed the folder from Favorites that isn't possible. Finder handles a Favorite folder as the root of the structure.\nIs there a setting to this or some other quick nifty way of backing even further up in the tree from a favorite folder?\n\nA: You can right-click (control-click) on the folder name in the Titlebar of the Finder window and select a parent folder and or you can expose the Path Bar in Finder (View > Show Path Bar) and select a parent folder from there.\nAlso from the Sidebar you can right-click (control-click) on the Favorites name and select Open Enclosing Folder, although this opens another Finder window whereas the previous suggestions stay within the same Finder window.\nAdditionally one should become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts of Finder which one can see shown on each menu in Finder, particularly the Go menu.  Like, Command–Up Arrow as mentioned by Ivan Chau in the OP comments.\nNote: See Finder shortcuts in: Mac keyboard shortcuts\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Pro13-inc, 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7 use CL9 memory reliably? Looking for a memory upgrade for a macbook pro 13-inc, 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, The Apple specifications call for CL11 RAM.\nThe question is if it will work fine with a CL9 memory so I can take advantage of benchmark improvements like this?\n\nA: Personally, I wouldn't risk buying anything that is not explicitly supported. You may run into problems in the long term if the memory modules draw too much power or are too fast/slow. \nYou may want to check corsair.com/en-us/…, a 2x8GB memory module pack with 11-11-11-30 CAS timing (that is, CL=11, as Apple recommends). Corsair states that their \"memory kits are tested at Apple Developer Compatibility Labs and work with most MacBook® Pro, iMac®, and Mac mini systems shipped in 2011 and newer.\" \nSince you mention in a comment that you plan on installing 16 GB while Apple only officially supports 8 GB: I bought 16 GB for my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) and it works like a charm, although Apple's documentation states the maximum installable memory is 8 GB. \nSince my Mac has a non supported configuration, if I go to a Genius Appointment in an Apple Store I consequently replace my non-stardard modules with the original ones.\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stick to Apple's specs (speed, type, voltage, format, etc).\n\n*If other people confirm that more than the supported amount of RAM works, it is definitely worth a try. It will either work or fail, but it won't burn your computer's motherboard of anything. See this question at superuser for some opinions on this topic.\n\n\n(Disclamer: I'm in no way affiliated to Corsair.) \n\nA: Setting aside any concerns that you won't realize much gain - just buy the RAM from a vendor that will back up the use you intend and/or offer pre-sales assistance to ensure you don't need to return product that works fine but is installed in the wrong Mac.\nI can't vouch for that particular model, but the Mac logic boards are now easily identified by GPU/CPU and you can trust that any RAM that works when reviewed by any PC or Mac site will work for you on your CPU.\nHopefully someone will have actual experience if you can't get assistance from the vendor and extrapolating from other customer reviews online.\n", "Q: What tools read SMART data and can run on USB bootable media?

I have SMART utility but I can't think of any way on how to use it like this.\nAny good recommendations for a USB or CD bootable solution to check my HDD SMART values?\n\nA: The process to make your own test rig is quite easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install OS X onto a USB hard drive. A partition with 20 GB should be just fine.\n\n*Use the Startup Disk preference pane to reboot to that new OS and create an admin user.\n\n*Install homebrew - https://brew.sh\n\n*Install smartmontools - brew install smartmontools \n\n*Get a USB drive or SD card if you don't want to boot from the hard drive/partition.\n\n*Thin out files if your image won't fit on the chosen media (or buy larger media)\n\n*Use Disk Utility to Restore the OS from the partition to the media chosen\n\n\nNow you have a UDB/SD card that can boot your Mac and run one of the best free SMART tools.\n", "Q: Is there any energy wasted through USB cables due to data sync when plugged in wall charger Is there any energy wasted through USB cables due to data sync feature when plugged in wall charger.\nThe thing is, I've heard of some engineered USB cables such as \"SONICable\" and \"Doubletime\" which can allow your smartphone to charge its battery twice as fast when you plug it to your computer USB port.\nThat's accomplished by some smart PCB that talks to both your smartphone and your computer, and tell it to eliminate the data sync feature, and focus all energy to charge the smartphone.\nhttps://youtu.be/EBWQAClwjfc\nSo, I was wondering if it also can speed up the charging process when it's plugged into wall charger...\n\nA: According to this article (sorry, german only) the iPhone - attached to a wall charger - detects that no data sync is possible and charges with the full specified power (±1000 mA).\nAttached to an USB 2 interface (like your Mac) the power is reduced to ±500 mA to not interfere with the data stream.\nNow the smart PCBs in USB cables as \"SONICable\" and \"Doubletime\" come in: Attached to an USB interface they trick the charging controller by simulating a wall charger on the data lines and the charging power is then increased to > 500 mA again if the interface can deliver that. As mentioned by bmike ♦ USB1/2 is specified with 500 mA and USB3 with 900 mA. But most interfaces have some upwards tolerance and deliver more power than specified and thus decrease charging time.\nDue to the non-linearity of the charging process the charging time will NOT be halved though!\nThe conclusion of the linked (german) post: \nIn some combination (USB3 - Tablet, not necessarily Apple devices!) charging speed will be increased up to 100%. In most cases the charging speed increase is lower than 100%. Attached to a wall charger no significant speed increase is detected.\nTo answer your question(s): \n\n\n*\n\n*Attached to a wall charger charging speed shouldn't be increased noticeable using the two mentioned cables.\n\n*No energy is wasted through USB cables due to data sync when plugged in wall chargers.\n\n\nA: I think the real question is covered by Apple in that no energy is wasted when you have a data connection.\nThe standard charge is:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3 - 900 mA at 5V (4.5 Watts)\n\n*USB 2 - 500 mA at 5V (2.5 Watts)\n\n*USB 1 - 500 mA at 5V (2.5 Watts)\n\n\nApple and some third party devices have a high power USB mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*1100 mA at 5V (5.5 Watts)\n\n\nApple products will request more power and only if your computer or hub is programmed to listen for that request will it be OK to provide up to 1100 mA at 5V. This high power mode doesn't really care if data is present or only charging is present, so somehow removing the data lanes won't trigger higher power charging.\n", "Q: Looking for a way to mimic the battery-saving behavior of closing the lid without actually doing so I'm looking for a way to keep the lid up, yet tell my Macbook Pro Late 2013 to do what it would do if the lid was actually closed.

All while keeping the lid open at all times because I have an external display and it's unnecessary having to close the lid when I'm done using it. When I'm ready to use it, I would just wake it using my bluetooth keyboard, or the power button. That would be comparable to opening the lid. \nI have my hibernation setting at 3. \nI'm sure there are some terminal commands to make this happen, I'm just unaware of it.\n\nA: You can find these options in System Preferences > Energy Saver.\nDrag the \"Computer Sleep:\" slider to the left.\n\nNote that for newer Apple portables, Yosemite combines the sleep and display sleep option:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2013-mba-no-computer-sleep-setting-wtf-heres-why.1598329/\n\nA: Yes with time you can do like Ender says, or simply do it directly by clicking on the Apple on the top-left corner and click Suspend Activity (Go in sleeping mode)\n\nA: You should be able to use Ctrl + Shift + Eject, this puts the mac to sleep.  On a Macbook you need to use Ctrl + Shift + Power since there is no eject button (unless you are using an external keyboard).\n", "Q: Disk space not free up after photos and videos are deleted from Photos app In Photos app of my MacBook, I delete hundreds of photos. Then I go to Show Recently Deleted screen, click Delete All.\nHowever, my disk space is same as before as shown on Finder.\nHow can I get the disk space back?\n\nA: Your pictures didn't get deleted because they still exist in iPhoto or Aperture, whichever one you use.  As Apple says in this support article, Photos saves disk space by creating links to the already-existing files in iPhoto/Aperture, rather than duplicating them. That means that if you want to delete a file, you need to make sure it's deleted everywhere.\nIf you can live without ever using iPhoto/Aperture again, go to your Pictures folder and delete iPhoto Library and Aperture Library. That way, the only copies of your pictures will be the ones in Photos, and deleting them will free up space on your computer.\n", "Q: Updating OS X 10.6 install screen stuck I just re-installed Mac OS X 10.6 on my MacBook Pro (2008 ed) using the original DVD.

Not sure what that screen is called but it is the one that looks like the galaxy.\nNothing is happening—it seems stuck there. I have no window telling me to continue, or agree or install, as is the usual order of things. I have tried this twice; i.e. have used the power button to shut down because the computer does not respond to anything else when that screen is on. Then I re-did update software, receive the message that the software has already downloaded, told to restart in order to install, and the same thing happens. Any ideas?\n\nA: If you reinstalled without erasing the disk, you might have something incompatible from your previous system. Try to restart holding the SHIFT key. This brings you into safe mode, where only apple components are loaded. The system might react slow, but should let you apply the update. (Would also prefer the combo update, as mentioned by 'forquare'.)\n\nA: Click into 'show details' before you start the download, then untick all the itunes updates and start the download. It should work fine then. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: How to know that a macbook pro box has never been opened ? How to know that a macbook pro box has never been opened ?

Inside, the machine has a clear plastic sleeve with an Apple license sticker which has a perforated strip which is intended to be broken. However you can open this sleeve from the side leaving the sticker intact. \n\nA: Not definitive for a MacBook- but a new iMac I opened only last week had an irreplaceable tear strip across the box lid.

Whether it's FireWire or Thunderbolt, the only rare situation is where you mix generations.\nFor example a firewire 400 cable should go at the end of the 800 chain. Same for Thunderbolt 1 and 2 (and soon 3).\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I daisy chain Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 to FireWire 400\n\n*Does daisy chaining FireWire 800 and 400 cause all devices to use 400 speeds?\nI haven't seen any issues with powered off thunderbolt drives in the middle of a chain to the display, but I'd probably put the display first and then plug the drives in down stream of the display if you have that option.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite network-popdown suddenly have a permanent Device entry After the latest minor Mac OS-X upgrade to Yosemite, I discovered I suddenly have a new and permanent entry in my network-popdown menu, located under a \"Device\" heading named SETUP.\n\nIt's permanent in the way that as long as Wi-Fi is on, it's visible with the same signal-strength - no matter where I bring the computer (also far away from mobile devices).\nI can connect the Mac to the SETUP node without problems...\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's that Device entry? \n\n*What's that SETUP node? - I guess it's something running on my Mac?\n\n*How do I best scan the SETUP node, to learn more about it?\n\n\nA: What's that \"Device\" entry?\nThe entries under Device are wireless ad hoc networks, a type of wireless network that doesn't involve an access point or router, that is, a point-to-point wireless network, which usually connects two computers or a printer to a computer.\nI couldn't find any Knowledge Base article at support.apple.com but theMacObserver has an excellent article about it.\nWhat's that SETUP node? - I guess it's something running on my Mac?\nIn your case, the ad hoc network is probably a printer nearby that is broadcasting its name. Another usual ad hoc network name is hpsetup, the default ad hoc network used by HP printers.\nHow do I best scan the SETUP node, to learn more about it?\nYou could connect to it and run /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s to get some information, but I don't think that's going to be of much use. You better go over to your neighbor's house and ask whether they have bought a printer lately.\nHow can I create an ad hoc network?\nYou can easily create an ad hoc network yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Wi-Fi menu in the menu bar choose Create Network...:\n\n\n*Choose a name (that's the name that will appear under Device) and press Create:\n\n\n*This is the new entry:\n\nIf you select Disconnect from <network> the ad hoc network is torn down.\n", "Q: Changed iCloud password but Yosemite password not changed I recently changed my iCloud password on my iPhone but the password to log in to my Macbook Pro (running Yosemite) hasn't changed.

I can still view half of the display (notifications are still showing, etc.) but all control of the screen has been lost. Unfortunately, so has the touch unlock feature.\nI'm desperate to be able to back it up before I send it to iPhone heaven, but am having real difficulties. I've tried a couple of the apps such as DrFone, but they all require a passcode.\nHas anyone got any ideas please?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there are not many options available should the screen be shattered. Depending on how valuable the data on your phone is (photos, texts, etc). then you might want to check into having the screen repaired. \nAn iPhone 6 screen can be repaired Out of Warranty by Apple for $106 + tax at a local Apple store, and there are also Service Providers (authorized) and third-parties which will also fix the screen at similar costs which may be closer to you. I'd recommend you look into that option, as \n\n\n*\n\n*you will be able to retrieve your data (assuming no further damage than the screen)\n\n*You won't have to get a new phone over the issue, since the old one would be fixed\n\n\nBeyond a physical repair of the device, your options would be limited. I might also suggest reaching out to a local third-party service as they might be willing to hook up a spare screen to your phone for the purpose of unlocking and backing up the data, but not a repair, at a lower cost should the full repair be too expensive. Of course, note that any 3rd-party repairs done by a non-AASP and/or non-Apple would void the warranty, should you have one.\n\nA: In order to backup your iPhone, you need to be able to unlock it. This you have already discovered. Unfortunately, the iPhone has some quite good security, and you have run into some of it here: there is just no way around entering your password. \nMy suggestion is to do something completely different: replace the screen. There is risk that you lose your data with this approach, but if you replace your phone your data is gone with certainty. You can find a local service or visit someplace like iFixit where you can purchase a new screen, and view videos of how to do it yourself. For less than $100, you can restore your screen, unlock the phone, back it up, and get a replacement. Not the cheapest alternative, but perhaps worthwile considering.\n\nA: Had a similar problem. I used an old iPad dock with keyboard and an adapter for the lightning port. I was able to enter the passcode and unlock the phone without using the touchscreen or any button. Maybe you can get such dock from eBay etc.\nhttp://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac-software/unboxing-apple-ipad-keyboard-dock-3221762/\nThere is no serious way to do it by software or such without unlocking it first. Forensic software is needed to decrypt the unlocked data partition of the device. \n", "Q: How do I use Split View in OS X 10.11 El Capitan? I downloaded the Developer Preview of OS X El Capitan and I'm trying to use the new side-by-side split view feature.  However, I can't seem to figure out the right incantation to use it.\nHow do I put two apps side-by-side in a full screen split view on El Capitan?\n\nA: It appears that I was doing it wrong.  I don't see a way to enable split-screen from just two fullscreen windows in mission control.  Nor do I see a way to enable it from two regular windows.  But if you have one fullscreen window and one regular window, you can drag the regular window onto the fullscreen in mission control, and it will create a split-screen view.\nI tried this successfully with Safari, Finder, and Chrome.\n\nA: For the split-screen feature to be available \"Displays have seperate Spaces\" needs to be enabled in the System Preferences of Mission Control:\n\nPlease also note a log out is required if this setting is toggled.\n\nA: It's no longer Developer Preview. the solution I just found is:\nPress and hold the green fullscreen button, drag the current window to the left/right side of screen, and select the second window for the other half of the screen.\n\nA: I searched to make It, yet I tested it and worked (magic?) You must click on the Green button on the window, and make a reboot after installed El Capitan :)\n", "Q: How can I identify the cause of this SSL error in Safari 6? I was seeing an SSL error in Safari 6.1.6 (8537.78.2) on OSX 10.8.5 when visiting a website, and the debug information provided from the developer tools didn't indicate the source of the issue. The issue was reported by multiple users of OSX 10.8, and was resolved for those users by restoring TLSv1 in the server configuration (config change at bottom of question).\nThe error message in Safari developer tools was\n\nFailed to load resource: An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made.\n\nIn Safari, there was no additional information under the \"Requests > Network\" tab (which I saw referenced on other answers). The information there seemed to relate to loading the content of the error message rather than the original site.\nWhat other methods, if any, could I have used to extract a \"server lacks TLSv1 support\" message from Safari 6 / OSX 10.8.x?\n\nAdditional background info: The change required to the nginx server configuration was this -\n-ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n+ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n\n\nA: Safari 6.1.6 supports only TLS 1.0 (which is increasingly being turned off by servers concerned about the BEAST attack), and there's no error message apart from that generic \"SSL error has occurred\" in the Console.  You'd need a newer version of macOS to carry on using Safari on those sites.  If upgrading the OS is not an option (for example if you still need the older version of Xcode) then you could try Firefox 45.9.0 ESR, which uses TLS 1.2 (confirmed with www.HowsMySSL.com); that version of Firefox passed its end-of-life in mid-2017 (and more recent versions require a newer OS), but at least it's an improvement over Safari 6.1.6.  However I'd be more comfortable installing a modern OS alongside the Lion / Mountain Lion, or at least using VirtualBox to run a modern version of GNU/Linux inside it, and using an up-to-date browser from there.\n", "Q: Is this S.M.A.R.T. data normal for a 2013 Macbook Air SSD? I have had a Mid 2013 13\" Macbook Air for a couple of years but have barely used it as I am more of a Windows person. However, one of the things that has bothered me a bit since owning it is that the Unexpected Power Loss Count attribute on the SSD is constantly spiking, going up by several thousand per hour. It makes no difference whether the laptop is plugged in or not.\nI have disabled the Put hard disks to sleep when possible and I think it may have reduced the problem a little but I'm not 100% sure.\nCurrently I am running OS X 10.9 Mavericks. The SSD is listed as Apple SSD SD0128F which is known to be a SanDisk model. Here is the data from an app called SSD health:\n\nDisk Utility has similar values although they are displayed in hexadecimal.\nWhilst I realise that the raw values are not necessarily something to trust, it is nevertheless my understanding that increasing values for this attribute can indicate some kind of problem and can indicate a risk of data loss. Certainly this seems to be the case on Windows machines where the raw value is normally kept very low and associated with machines not being shut down properly or a driver issue.\nI was hoping someone with a Macbook Air and similar Sandisk SD0XXXF type SSD could check their data to compare it to mine. The laptop is coming up to the end of its two year warranty so if there is an issue I would like to get it fixed soon.\n\nA: Fundamentally the SMART data of your 2013 Macbook Air SSD is normal comparing it with my Apple SSD SD0128F (inside a Fusion drive).\nProbably some attribute names (namely Unexpected Power Loss Count and Program Fail Count Chip) provided by your SMART app are false:\nUsing two different SMART utilities here, the ID# 174 has the attribute name Host_Reads_MiB and the ID# 175 has the attribute name Host_Writes_MiB in both applications, which mean all read / written Mebibytes (~ 1.05 MB) in the life time of the SSD.\nIn your case that would translate to ~773 GB read and ~367 GB written.\nConsidering 3 power on hours (ID 9) of the SSD this results in 71.6 MB/s read and 33.9 MB/s written constantly - which seems a bit high.\nThe values here are 14,894,386 and 20,658,326 which equal 15.6 TB read and 21,7 TB written. With 698 power on hours this results in 6.2 MB/s read and 8.6 MB/s written constantly.\n\nYou may test this by making notes of the two values (ID174/175), executing a full restart and comparing the new values with the old values:\nIn my case (Mavericks 10.9.5) on the SSD the ∆ host_reads_MiB is 1820 MB and the ∆ host_writes_MiB 291 MB. On the HDD the ∆ Total_LBA_READ is 475 MB and the ∆ Total_LBA_Written 22 MB. Taken together ~2.3 GB are read and 313 MB are written while restarting a Mac - which seem legit values.\n", "Q: Is there a disk space analyzer that lets you save the disk image? I've seen there are a number of different applications for OSX that lets you visualize disk space and browse the category tree as an index - JDiskReport, DaisyDisk, Disk Inventory X, etc.\nI would like to be able to save the disk image and directory tree that these applications generate for future reference and browsing. Does anyone know if any application of this kind allow for that?\nI can't find this information in these applications' online feature spec.\nThanks.\n\nA: You could simply take a picture of a portion of the window that contains what you want with command + shift + 4, and use the cursor to select, or use command + shift + 4 then space bar and select the entire window.\n\nA: I've done some more research and found out that at least JDiskReport has this functionality.\n", "Q: iphone 6 ios 8 siri only working with external mic! I have a jailbroken iPhone 6 running iOS 8.2. My problem is that Siri does not work with the internal microphone. Siri and dictation work fine with any  external mic like the kind that you'd find on the stock Apple iPhone headphones.\n\nA: do you have any tweaks or something that works with bluetooth, and or the mic?\nto rule out jailbreak, turn off your phone and turn it back on while holding the volume up button, this disables all the jailbreak tweaks... like a safe mode, if siri works fine, then you know it has something to do with your JB if not? then it has something to do with your OS\n\nA: You would start by quitting all the running apps on your phone:\niOS: Force an app to close\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5137\nDouble-click the Home button.\nSwipe left or right until you have located the app you wish to close.\nSwipe the app up to close it.\nWhen you have done that restart the phone and test the issue again:\niOS: Turning off and on (restarting) and resetting\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1430\n\nA: Dictation and Siri uses the front facing microphone. This is separate from the microphone voice memo uses. I thought there was only one microphone on iPhone 6 which initially let me to believe Siri/dictation not working was a software configuration issue.\nIf the microphone is defective you won't hear audio after you record a selfie video saying \"Steve Jobs was the bomb\". \n\nA: Ok this is SOLVED!!! Yeaaaa!! :-)\nAfter I updated, Siri and Dictation quit working and only worked on Bluetooth! \nI tried everything and spent days researching it on the web and no one knew anything!\nI checked all the settings, I tested the memo mic and the main camera mic and all worked good. I was positive it was a software issue and it was... More or less.\nTurns out that the selfee mic IS the problem, it's the mic on the screen side of the phone near the camera. And it's not the same one used for memo recording that's on the bottom!\nMaybe my phone used more than one mic or a different mic for Siri and Dictation before the update, and then after the update used only the Selfee mic... I don't know, but I bought a camera and mic combo part and a pentalobe screwdriver to get the screws out and changed it my self.\nAnd BINGO! no more Siri and dictation problems. WHEW!!! \n", "Q: OS X El Capitan find mouse dosen't work with external mouse Yesterday I installed El Capitan 10.11 (15A204h) and liked it a ton and intend to be use it exclusively from now on. I really liked the feature where you can shake the mouse to find the cursor and was very disappointed to find it didn't work when I tried with an external mouse.\nDoes anyone have any hacks or methods to get this to work? I think it's a really good feature and I don't want to not have it when working with external mouses and displays.\n\nA: I know a hack to make it work. It's called \"tell Apple that there's a bug in their beta software.\"\nSeriously, don't expect flawless performance from features that still have every right to be half-baked. Open Feedback Assistant and file a report in the hope that Apple will have it fixed by the time El Capitan gets its stable release. Odds are other beta testers are having your problem too, so it's your duty as a tester to report all the bugs you can find.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable the internal speaker in Macbook? I'm using a headphone at my workplace but I don't want to disturb others in case the headphone isn't working properly or I disconnect the headphone by accident. So I'm trying to find a method that can disable the internal speaker completely. Is there a way to do so in Macbook?\n\nA: When you switch audio outputs, the volume level reverts to whatever level it was at when you last used that output. That means that if you mute the internal speaker before plugging in headphones, it'll stay muted if you accidentally disconnect your headphones.\nIf that's not enough, you can also use Soundflower. It's an extension designed to let your Mac record its own audio output, which it does by creating virtual input and output options that feed directly into each other. That means that you can hold down Option, click on the volume icon in the menu bar, and select one of the Soundflower options as your audio output before plugging in your headphones and selecting them as the output device. If your headphones get disconnected, your audio output will default to Soundflower, which doesn't send anything through the speaker.\n", "Q: Cannot enroll in Apple Developer program I have been meaning to finish my developer account and sign up for the iOS program, and since WWDC2015 just happened, I thought no better time than now. \nUnfortunately, when I go to enroll, I am told\n\n\"Sorry, you can’t enroll at this time.\"\n\nI figured this might have to do with me being under 18, however, I have set up a corporation so I can bypass this roadblock. Furthermore, when I started to sign up previously, I had no issues up until this point.\nIs this a side-effect of WWDC? What can I do?\n\nA: I imagine that during WWDC the demand for dev accounts is higher than usual, and also that most of the people at Apple who would normally look into any problems with the developer program are likely to be at WWDC themselves.\nTry again next week?\n", "Q: How do you completely disable the space-switching animations in OS X Yosemite?

I have forgotten my Restrictions passcode.\nIs there a way that I can change it without resetting the iPhone? I have tried updating it and have contacted Technical Support, but they suggested that I back up my files to iCloud and restore to factory settings.\n\nA: There is no way to remove the Restrictions passcode without restoring the device in iTunes or from the device. However, you can save your data by backing it up to iCloud or iTunes and restoring all content to the device after it has been restored.\n\nA: Per Apple's support document: \n\nIf you lose or forget your Restrictions passcode, you'll need to erase\n  your device and then set it up as a new device to remove the passcode.\n  Restoring the device won't remove the passcode.\n\n\nA: You could ask the Apple Store employees to give you a new iPhone, or you could ask them to attempt entering your Restrictions passcode on your device.\nHope that works!\n", "Q: What is \"sperion\"?

I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro 13\" with 8 GB of memory. Lately my MacBook Pro uses swap memory, when it has enough free memory. Is this normal and can I do something about it? Also when I only have safari and let's say Xcode open it uses 99% of the RAM. Is this normal behavior?\n\n\nA: According to what I can understand from your screenshot (I don't know your language), you're only using 256KB of swap space, which is nothing. I wouln't worry unless your memory pressure went up\n\nA: This is normal behavior. You are not experiencing any memory issues in your screenshot above. What I suspect is happening is that OS X is creating some placeholder of sorts to enable swap memory, rather than actually using swap memory here. I have never seen a zero in the swap memory section, unless I have just restarted and open the Activity Monitor window fresh, and even then, I rarely see zero. \nWith Mavericks and Yosemite, the way the OS uses memory changed a bit. Essentially, the OS takes all the memory, and then manages it out as needed. So, our traditional way of looking at the memory report in Activity Monitor is not really valid. Due to this, Mavericks added the 'Memory Pressure' gauge, to give you an idea of when you have a limitation caused by memory. In your screenshot, you have a green memory pressure. For more see this answer.\nArs Technica has a nice description of this 'memory compression' in their Mavericks review:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/17/\n\nA: You would need to be monitoring the memory and swap usage as the swap file was created to have a chance to understand why the swap was created. Based on what you describe in text and in the screen shot, I see nothing that is concerning. \nAs to why swap was created when you assume you had free RAM. The OS can move to swap based on predictive measures. For example, maybe you started up Photoshop which had several large image files automatically reopen from a prior session. The OS could see that there was suddenly a huge new demand on RAM, and moved some unused RAM content to swap in advanced of an expected need.\nOr your backup program briefly ran in the background, and did a huge number of file checksums and comparisons and created large RAM based data structures, pushing other content to swap. Then the backup program released its RAM and went back to sleep.\nMac OS X (and most modern OS: Windows, Linux, etc) are very intelligent about automatically using Cache, Swap, memory compression and other techniques to keep the system running as fast as possible. I really would not be worrying about this unless you see that the Activity Monitor is reporting that Memory Pressure is in the Yellow or Red zone. \nI currently have a 2010 13\" MacBook Pro that has 16GB of RAM. I do lots of work that is heavy on RAM usages. (Web Development, data mining, running many heavy duty apps at the same time.) Even with 16GB I sometimes hit the Yellow zone for memory pressure. But I have to say this is seldom an issue because Mac OS X is very good about allocating resources as needed. \nWhile I need the 16GB of RAM for my work, you should know that such an upgrade is not without negatives. The extra RAM does significantly reduce battery life both in active usage and in sleep.  \n\nA: Your Mac runs on Unix ( certified Single Unix Specification 2003 ), and that OS has been around for 40+ years. Core components (like memory management) are written, updated, debugged and polished by people who are definitive experts in the field. Apple, with more cash on hand than the US Treasury, can afford to hire the absolute best.\nSo, unless you have at least a PhD in theoretical computer science, and wrote your thesis on kernel-level process and memory management, stop worrying about the memory management. I have 24Gb in my desktop and it still uses swap. This concerns me not at all.\n", "Q: Transfer Data between Macs I have a local web development environment setup with Brew, Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Ruby, Gem, Sass, and so many other packages out there that it would probably be a nightmare to set it up again with the same exact versions on a new machine.

Otherwise I'm afraid you'll have to reinstall all of your tools and libraries. \n", "Q: Messages app crashing I can't open Messages app on my iPhone 5S with iOS 8.3 (no jailbreak) - it crashes on start.

I have a Mac Pro 2012, and recently installed a new Gigabyte GTX 760 graphics/video card. I also have Windows 7 installed on this computer on my Bootcamp partition.\nWhen I attempt to start up my computer and enter the \"boot manager\" by holding down the Option key, I get nothing. The computer chimes, but I see only a black screen, and have to hold the power button to shut off.\nThe normal OSX system boots fine if I don't touch anything, and I can only boot Windows if I select that partition while in OSX and restart.\nI found that if I swapped back to the original video card, an ATI Radeon HD 5770, it boots to \"boot manager\" without a problem, and lets me select which partition on my drive to boot to.\nAfter some research, I am gathering that this has to do with the EFI/BIOS process, but I don't really understand where that lies, nor what is going wrong.  \nIf I'm understanding this right, here are some questions, but let me ask the most basic and important one first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does it boot to a black screen with the NVIDIA GTX card?\n\n\nand kind of a tangent, and might even be answered in your answers, but:\n\n\n*Is there EFI/BIOS on the graphics card itself?\n\n\nA: I don't know the precise technical reason, but unless your NVidia is specifically flashed for Mac it doesn't load the drivers until you reach the desktop. \nAs you can see, this makes dealing with anything prior to that quite difficult. \nFor boot camp the simplest workaround is to define the startup disk before rebooting. \nAs you've noticed, keeping the old ATI for emergencies is a good idea. \n", "Q: How do I reduce iPhone data usage on my cell phone plan I have an iphone 5 as does my daughter on the same family plan.

What I have is:\nIF(BM16=−1,1,\"O\") \n\nThis produces the letter ‘O’ for open in my case.\nWhat I want is the above plus if BK16 is >0 and/or if BM16 is greater than >-1 then the cell will produce a blank. Can this all be done in one formula?\nAnother way, and possibly better, to do this in my sheet would be IF(BM16=−1,1,\"O\") plus check for a string generated in an adjacent cell by a different conditional: resulting in the above formula plus IF ‘string’ in a specified cell = X OTM, then generate a blank cell.\n\nA: Replace the \"0\" by the second formula\n=IF(BM16=−1,1,if(BK16>0, \"\", if(BM16 > -1 , \"\", \"O\"))) \n\nanything after = is a formula and can be used where you want a value\n", "Q: Play torrented video while downloading in uTorrent I've seen this feature is available in uTorrent 3.0, but the mac version is only 1.8.7? How do I play torrents while they download on OS X?\n\nA: Given the way torrents work ( piece from here, piece from there ) wether you can play a part before downloading the whole will depend on wether you have the part you want. \nIn short, maybe yes, maybe no.\n", "Q: Where is the UDID stored on the iPhone? Where on the iPhone is information regarding the phone's UDID, IMEI, serial number, etc. stored? Are they somewhere in the filesystem, or are they off of the hard drive and stored somewhere else instead?\nMy question is not how I can access the UDID in an app that I am writing for the iPhone, but rather I want to know how and/or where iOS stores this information in the filesystem. \n\nA: Like the MAC address of a network device the UDID is hard coded into the iPhone/iPad hardware itself.\nWithout jailbreaking it can't be changed. However if you want to jailbreak your phone it is possible to fake the UDID, kind of like MAC address spoofing (or so it seems).\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite focuses automatically Lately I started experiencing that - 'issue' / 'bug' / 'feature' on my MacBook Air with OS X Yosemite.\nWhenever I open a new window (of any app) something gets focused immediately (getting that selection frame around it, usually blue).\nThat happens in notification center as well. That's really annoying.\nAnyone knows how to get rid of it?\nHere's an example, look at the segment control:\n\n\nA: This is because Full Keyboard Access is turned on. To turn it off, go to \nSystem Preferences, Keyboard, Shortcuts tab, and select Text boxes and lists only at the bottom.\nAlternatively, Control-F7 will toggle this.\n", "Q: SATA cable problem? I have a MacBook Pro 8,2 (15 inch, early 2011) running Yosemite (with encryption enabled). I have a strange problem that seems to relate to my boot drive (Samsung 840 Pro SSD).\nThe system runs great but when I try to reboot normally, it never boots. It simply waits several seconds and then comes up with the flashing question mark folder icon. If I hold down the option key to get the EFI password prompt and then the listing of attached drives, I can select the correct drive (there normally is only the one internal drive) and it seems to boot successfully 100% of the time.\nI've seen on here that many people have trouble with the SATA cable on this model. Is it possible for my SATA cable to be bad, but have no discernible problems with normal operation or booting from the boot menu? If not, what else could cause this problem? Is there a recommended utility to check the cable?\n\nA: There is no software utility to check if a cable is defective.\nyour symptoms are odd and could point to an issue with NVRAM that booting into the boot selector allows you to force EFI to pick a boot device manually. I would zap the PRAM (boot holding COMMAND, OPTION, P, R) and let it bong three times. \nFailing that try resetting the SMC (power off the Mac, Remove the battery, I tap the power button a couple of times but Apple says you don't have to, reinsert the battery and power on) and see if that does it.\nFailing those two things I would make a Genius appointment at your Friendly Neighborhood Apple Store and see what they say.\nThey will diagnose it even if you are out of warranty and tell you how much it will cost to fix.\n", "Q: El Captain Split Screen on Yosemite Apple has recently announced El Captain in their WWDC. One of the features announced was split screen mode.\nSince I am not an developer I have to wait until July to have access to some of the features. Is there a tweak I can install on Yosemite to gain the SplitScreen View?\nNote:\nI have BetterTouchTool however that only allows for window snapping. I want the resizable feature that El Captain has.\n\nA: Divvy or another third party app is your only solution. The code to do this isn't on Yosemite.\n\nA: Might I suggest Cinch, it is super easy to setup and use and is entirely free!\nClick the \"Download\" button\n", "Q: Block sites at specific times When at college I sometimes find myself looking at website such as Stack Exchange and Mac Rumours. Is there a way how to block sites like this on Yosemite every 1.5hr with 30min break?\nWhat I mean is, is there an application to block specific websites at time such as 9:00-10:30 then again 11:00-12:30 etc?\nThis would help me to do more work at college and not get distracted. I would like an application that blocks the sites for ALL applications, however a Safari extension will work too (I only use Safari so Chrome extensions will be useless). I know editing the hosts file could work however I want it to change at certain times (I may try and make a script if no applications work :) ).\n\nA: WasteNoTime is a Safari browser extension which should have the requested features according to the website:\n\nWasteNoTime is a browser extension which is designed to help you manage your time spent on the Internet more efficiently.\nTime Tracker feature gives you reports on what web sites you spent most of your time.\nInstant Lockdown feature allows you to focus on your work for a period of time with limited Internet access.\nTime Quota feature automatically block selected web sites when you have spent a preset amount of time on them each day.\n\n\nA: SelfControl is an app that blocks your blacklisted websites until its timer runs out. It's supposed to be so impenetrable that even deleting the app and rebooting your computer won't lift the block, though, so make sure you don't blacklist anything that you may possibly need before time's up.\n", "Q: What happens if I remove the localhost address from /etc/hosts I have looked at the hosts file before but never thought of this. The hosts file overrides the DNS addresses so it can be used to forward sites or to block them.\nWhen looking at the file, the default says this.\n\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost\n\nWhat happens if remove or change the localhost configuration file? Would it prevent my Mac from booting. Would I be able to boot into recovery mode and revert the changes or would I have to reinstall the OS? If I had bootcamp would I be able to fix it by booting into Windows?\n\nA: the only difference is that in order to access local web servers (for development purposes) you will need to use the address 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost.\n", "Q: Send/receive SMS (text messages) and place/receive calls from an iPad I'm looking for a solution to receive/place calls and SMS over the cellular network. \nFor now, my best solution would be Skype, but i can't receive SMS with it. Is there an equivalent ? \nThanks. \nEdit: it might be important : I'm in France, not in the US.\n\nA: Google Hangouts would do it. You'd have to get a Google account, and a Google Voice number, and then you can send/receive calls and texts with it.\nIf you had an iPhone i think you could also use the iPad to place/receive calls using the iPhone cell connection.  I don't think this is what you mean though\n\nA: There are many free and paid services out there that let you send and/or receive SMS messages via your web browser; some of them such as Skebby also have mobile apps available. You'd certainly have to do your research to find out which ones were reputable, though (and I make no such claim either way for Skebby, which I've never used... was just one of the first ones I found.)\n", "Q: Connecting 2 iPads with a router without internet I need to connect two iPads to a network without internet connection. Can I just do it with a simple router? Is there a good type of router to share data without internet?\n\nA: You can do this of course.  Any wifi router that the two iPads both support should connect them.  Just don't bother to connect to the Internet.\nI'm curious as to why you need this? Most iOS apps don't do peer to peer, though some obviously do.  Bittorrent Sync for one would possibly be useful here.\n\nA: Depending on what your goal is: You might not even need a router. Open a Personal Hotspot on one iPad (assuming it has 3G) and connect to it with the other one. You get the IP addresses of both in the WIFI settings of the second iPad.\n\nA: If you are simply sharing files, use AirDrop. Swipe up, and tap the AirDrop button. \nFor a Peer-to-Peer network, you can use your Mac as a router. Caveat: Your Mac must have a working Ethernet cable plugged in, but the iPads will not have an internet connection. \nOpen System Preferences > Sharing > click the lock icon to authenticate. Select \"Internet Sharing\" from the field on the left. From the \"Share your connection from:\" drop-down, select \"Ethernet,\" and in the \"To computers using:\" field select \"Wi-Fi.\" Now click the \"Wi-Fi Options\" button to set a network name and password. When done, click \"OK\". Tick the box in the left field next to \"Internet Sharing, then click \"Start\" on the menu that appears. \nOn each iPad, go to Settings > Wi-Fi, select the network you just named and connect to it. After you connect, tap the (i) next to the Wi-Fi signal for that network. Copy the IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Router to \"Static\". You can tap back and forth between the \"DHCP\" (default) tab, and \"Static\". For DNS, enter \"0.0.0.0\" and exit settings. \nBoth iPads will now be able to access each other and your Mac*, but will not have internet access. \n\n\n*\n\n*I just tested this using a VNC connection to view my Mac. This only works if you have \"Screen Sharing\" turned on in \"Sharing\".\n\n", "Q: Mac OS X is not starting anymore I tried to install Mac OS X El Capitan and it failed in ~70% progress after reboot and now I even can't start recovery mode (pressing Cmd+R just tries to continue installation process and fails again and again).\nAssuming I can get a backup of my user files over Target Disk Mode and then hand migrate them, what steps do I need to perform to wipe and reinstall Yosemite on my Mac?\n\nA: If you have another Mac, you should make a bootable Yosemite drive. To do that, you need an 8GB USB drive and the Yosemite installer downloaded. Here are the instructions, copied from the linked article:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect to your Mac a properly formatted 8GB (or larger) drive, and rename the drive Untitled. (The Terminal command used here assumes\n  the drive is named Untitled.) Also, make sure the Yosemite installer,\n  called Install OS X Yosemite.app, is in its default location in your\n  main Applications folder (/Applications). This means that if you moved\n  it before installing Yosemite, you need to move it back before making\n  your installer disk.\n  \n*Select the text of this Terminal command and copy it: sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\\n  Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume\n  /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\\n  Yosemite.app --nointeraction\n  \n*Launch Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities).\n  \n*Warning: This step will erase the destination drive or partition, so make sure that it doesn’t contain any valuable data.\nPaste the copied command into Terminal and press Return.\n\n  \n*Type your admin-level account password when prompted, and then press Return.\n  \n\nWhen that's done, plug that USB drive into the El Capitan Mac, hold down Option and turn the Mac on, and select Install OS X Yosemite from the list of startup drives. That should bring you into something that's identical to the Recovery HD for all intents and purposes (the only difference being that you don't need to redownload the OS X installer; it's stored locally). From there you should be able to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Yosemite. Good luck!\n\nA: Ok, I've managed to save my user profile. \nTo do this you'll need to open Terminal app and remove all folders except Users folder. And after, just run Internet Recovery and simply install a new system. Mac OS X Leopard was installed for me. After that I have upgraded it to Mac OS X Maverics. \nSo as result I have all my personal data is kept. But unfortunately my apps were lost. But it's even better for me as I wanted to remove unnecessary apps a long time ago :P\n", "Q: Downscale a iMac 5K screenshot to 50% using commandline \n*\n\n*Open the Screenshot in Preview\n\n*Select “Adjust Size…” from the Tools menu\n\n*Change the Width and Height to 50 percent of the original\n\n*Change the Resolution to 72 pixels/inch\n\n\nI wish to do this on CLI with a generic command (percent, not actual width and height).\nGUI instructions with Preview\n\nA: You can do it with imagemagick by typing the following:\nconvert image.png -resize 50% -density 72 image.png\n\n\nIn order to execute the previous command you need imagemagick installed on your computer.

My partners daughter has frazzed her mac book pro due to water damage and has been told that the data can be recovered for £?????. I can remove the hard drive myself and my partner has a mac book pro so can I obtain a cable (SATA?)and hook up the removed drive to the working mac book pro?\n\nA: That's a good plan. You can inspect the drive and see if it got wet, allow surface wetness to fry thoroughly before attempting to power it up.\nAs long as it spins, you'll likely be successful in recovery and might not even need something like Data Rescue to perform an undelete or partial recovery if the catalog is damaged.\n\nA: Rather than a SATA cable, you could use a 2.5\" SATA / USB case or enclosure if you are planing on using a MBP for recovery.\nUnless you'd like to replace the internal HDD with the damaged one and move the data to another destination.\nAs @bmike suggested, inspect the HDD and do not connect if it is wet.\n", "Q: Parallels or VirtualBox to run Clampfit on a MacBook Pro running Yosemite 10.10.3? I'm completely new to Macs and always used PCs so far.\nSaid so, I'll try to be as much specific as I can.\nI just bought a MacBook Pro running Yosemite 10.10.3 and am considering installing Parallels or VirtualBox (or?) to run Clampfit (a Windows-only compatible analysis software) on my Mac.\nMy Windows OS of choice would be XP or Windows 7 (unless otherwise suggested here).\nMy question is:\nwhich between Parallels and VirtualBox would be affecting the least the performance of my machine?\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*most likely I would not need to run softwares requiring large amounts of memory together with Clampfit\n\n*I already have Parallels\n\n\nThank you very much for your help.\nMassi\n\nA: I suppose the VMWare is also an option.\nHowever, as you know with Parallels, you can restrict the resources that are available to Window, such as the number of CPUs available between Mac and Win, the memory, and the video card memory.\nWhereas a typical configuration might be to share these resources equally between Mac and Win, in your case it makes sense to reduce the resources for Win (and consequently for Clampfit), and you can fine-tune this to your liking.\nI'm not certain about how much you can limit the amount of hard drive space available for Windows. I always went with the suggested 64 GB, and I don't recall if you could reduce this.\n\nA: I personally like VirtualBox.  \nI have an iMac 27 with a 3GHz i7 cpu and 32GB RAM running Yosemite.\nOn a daily basis I have three VB's running:  Windows 7 enterprise for Visio and MS Project, Windows 10 Tech Preview, and an Oracle Unbreakable Linux 7 server for web dev.\nEverything runs great.  While it obviously isn't as fast as running directly on my iMac, it is more than adequate.  MySQL and HTTP response is just as fast as if I was running it on a physical machine.  Windows 7 is smooth, though I have turned off most of the desktop animations (I don't like them to begin with).  Win 10 is beta so it has been up and down.\nHowever, I do have an entire Microsoft \"Lab\" virtualized on this machine.  At any time, I can load up a private network with Active Directory, SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint and 3 Win 7 clients.  Granted, it isn't super fast, but all are responsive and work.\nNow, you mentioned \"analysis software\" so I am guessing this is analytics.  Is it CPU intensive?  You can assign additional cores to the VM in VB.  Does it use a GPU (from your graphics card)?  You may be able to get some use out of VB but here I would suggest using a dedicated machine.  The question is, how intensive is your analysis software going to be?\nFor the price ($0) you simply cannot beat VB. If GPU is critical, then you might have to skip doing this in a VM and opt for Bootcamp.  If disk I/O is essential, either Bootcamp or Parallels.\n\nA: I have never owned or used Parallels so you might want to check my answer for accuracy. I am currently a VirtualBox user.\nFrom my understanding, you can run Windows using Parallels under OS X. You can also, run the same Windows without Parallels. So you have the best of both worlds. You can run Windows with or without virtualization. This is not true for VirtualBox. Here, you would have to install a separate copy of Windows, if you do not want to use virtualization. This would require buying two Windows licenses.\n", "Q: Preview Version 8.0 (859.21) How to extract images from PDF I have found that there was an option to extract images from PDFs via \"Save to iPhoto\" option of Preview.\nUnfortunately, I don't see this option in Version 8.0 (859.21).\nIs there still an option to export images from this Version of Preview? Any other ways native to Yosemite? \nscrshot of Preview Print Options\n\nthanks\n\nA: File > Export... can save any Preview-compatible file in any other Preview-compatible file format. Save your PDF as a picture file, such as JPEG or PNG, and then open that file and crop it until it's just the image you want.\n", "Q: No chimes at start up I am using 10.10.3 and need to do command R at the start up chimes but there are not any chimes and never have been, even on earlier versions.

Hopefully someone with more ideas than I can help.\n\nA: Try resetting the PRAM/NVRAM on your computer. Turn off your computer, put your fingers over the CommandOptionPR keys,  turn on your computer, and before the screen lights up, start holding down those four keys. Hold them down until you hear the startup chime a second time.

Or at least how can I keep an app from resetting my headphone volume when playback starts?\n\nA: I share this problem--but my sense is that the headphone volume reverts to the last volume the headphones were on.  I have the volume loud in the car, but when I run I want it much lower--I have to either lower the volume before leaving the car or lower it before listening with phones.  Otherwise blasting ensues.  Wish there were another way.\n\nA: I believe this issue is caused by the following setting:\nSet Settings >> Music >> Sound Check = OFF\nFor more information, here's Apple's description of the Sound Check feature.\n\nA: back in 2006\nhttp://www.dailytech.com/Man+Sues+Apple+Over+iPod+Hearing+Loss/article579.htm\nIn France, for example, all new iPods have limiting software inside the unit to govern the volume below 100 decibels -- the current models in the US can reach upwards of 125 decibels. \nI believe this is the same for phones\n", "Q: Play flash content in QuickTime player It possible play web video content like a Flash or HTML5 file in external player like a QuickTime player or VLC player. \nPlay video like it made in iphone when using safari.\n\nA: Some time ago I used the \"Elmedia Player\" for playing old flash movies I had on my disk.

Sorry if the title is confusing, I do not know how to describe it better. Perhaps an example will help you understand:\nWhen I download a 1GB file (it's an example) the appstore I notice that the download is quite fast, or I do not down 1GB, the application gets 1GB only after installation.\nSo I was curious, the application before being installer is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compressed source and compiled in the installation\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Pre-compiled and compressed\n\n\nWould any of these? Or is it something else?\n\nA: Apple stores their applications in what are essentially ZIP files, with a different extension. You could replace the \".ipa\" on an iPhone app for example with \".zip\" and extract its contents. So yes, they do use compression.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Yosemite: How to Install windows 7 with DVD I was wondering is it possible to Install Windows7 with a bootable DVD?\nOn apple web site:\n\nWhen you purchase Windows, it either comes as a disk image file (ISO)\n  or as an installation disc. If your copy of Windows came on a DVD, you\n  should create a disk image of your installation disc.\n\nWhy should I make an ISO when I have an original windows dvd and my mac is also have an optical drive?\n\nA: The answer really depends on the model of your Mac. Generally, if your Mac came with an internal optical drive, you probably should install using the DVD. Also, the Boot Camp Assistant is a good source to answer your question. If the option to create a Windows install USB flash drive is available, then you probably will need to create an iso file from your DVD. Start the Boot Camp Assistant application and continue through the windows until you get the \"Select Tasks\" window. Your answer will be based on the options that appear.\n", "Q: Extending Desktop Backgounds Apple already provide gorgeous photos for desktop background.

I am being told that if I don't turn Find My iPhone off I can't get my phone fixed.\nIs there any way I can recover my account information and turn off Find My iPhone in this situation?\n\nA: If you have Find My iPhone turned in, then you are signed into iCloud. Go to Settings > iCloud. At the top it will have a name and iCloud ID. Write down the icloud ID (it may be one of your non-apple email addresses) then click on that and it will ask for the for the password.

I would like to access files from another computer on the same network in the Terminal. But I am not sure of the path to those files. How do I find it?\n\nA: It would depend on how you want to access the file. Here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Initiate the connection to the remote computer (I do it via Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server [or Command+K]) but you can also do via terminal using the mount command\n\n*Connect to the shared folder/volume available to your user\n\n*When connecting to those in Terminal, you would now use the path /Volumes/[name of folder]/[rest_of_path_here] to access them.\n\n\nFor example, if you connected to a folder called Stuff with a subfolder called Things, and ultimately file jackpot.txt on ip 10.10.1.5, first connect via smb to the server (10.10.1.5), choose the folder Stuff, and then reference that path in Terminal as /Volumes/Stuff/Things/jackpot.txt\nEDIT: You can also run a Find command (Command + F) inside of Finder while you are connected to the share if you still don't know where the file is. Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, connect to the server/volume (Steps 1+2 above)\n\n*Run Command+F to Find, enter your search term\n\n*Above the Finder section where files display, switch the search to \"Shared\" - this will run the search against connected volumes\n\n*Locate the file you want, and then drag+drop it into an open Terminal window\n\n*The path will be shown in Terminal\n\n\nA: In addition to drag and drop, you can right click on any Finder window, select \"Customize Toolbar,\" and add the \"Path\" drop-down button. \nIt won't show a path you can copy-paste like in Windows, but it will give a better idea of the path to a folder you're in. \n", "Q: Why is OS X giving me a warning about installing apps when I try to open an XML file with Webstorm? I've extracted some XML files from an email attachment. I would like to open them in Webstorm instead of Xcode. But when I try to use the \"Open With -> Other\" and pick Webstorm, I get a message about being unable to install the app. That doesn't make any sense, since xml files are just text. Screenshots: \n\n\nAre XML files somehow defined as apps by OS X? Is there a way to change that? Is this a bug? \nI have verified that the file is just xml and it can be opened by WebStorm with no issues. This seems to be a Finder/security issue. \n\nA: Open Terminal and type xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine followed by a space, then drag the file or folder of files that you can't open directly into the Terminal window, and push return. You should now be able to open the file directly.\n", "Q: Thumbnails for old photos are wrong in Photos app I imported a large number of old photos into iPhoto, and I then updated to the new Photos app recently. After the update, the thumbnails on the old photos are incorrect. They are just thumbnails of different pictures.\nI cannot find a way to fix this. I tried launching Photos with CMD and Option held down and allowing the repair to complete. The problem persisted.\nI have added an image that shows a thumbnail that doesn't match the selected photo. Any ideas?\n\n\nA: To Rebuild the Photos.app Thumbnails:\nBackup your library before following these instructions.\nDelete the old thumbnails and various parts from the library:\nQuit the Photos app.\nOpen Finder, and go to the Photos.app Library, on my system it is called Photos Library and is found in the Pictures folder.\nNow right click the library and click Show Package Contents.\nNext delete the folders called Previews and Thumbnails.\nThen delete the files called ImageProxies.apdb, ImageProxies.apdb-wal, Library.apdb and Library.apdb-wal from the database folder.\nLastly delete the folders RKCloudResource, RKImageProxyState, RKMaster and RKVersion from the recovery folder.\nNow rebuild the library\nOpen the Photos app while pressing ⌥+⌘. It will ask you to if you want to repair the library, click Repair. It will do a repair, then your photos will go through a reprocess/reimport process. Once finished the thumbnails will start rebuilding.\nP.S. I tried this on my own Photos library, and it worked.\n\nA: Simply rotate all your photo's to the right using ⌥+⌘+R and then to the left using ⌘+R. This could take some time, but it isn't as hard as exporting and importing the whole library.\n\nA: From the discussion forums at Apple:\n\nAre you still able to use iPhoto on your iPhoto Library?  If so run the first aid on that library with iPhoto and apply Options #1, Repair Library Permissions, #2 - Rebuild Thumbnails and #4 - Rebuild Library Database. \nThen open that \"fixed\" library with Photos to create a new Photos library.  See if that will bring the thumbnails back.\n\n\nA: Try changing the shape of the thumbnails. \nThere is an option \"Display Square Thumbnails in Split view\" under the View menu option. I can't be sure, but this may cause the app to redraw the thumbnails, and may resolve your problem (lets hope so anyway).\n\n", "Q: Removing a specific app from spotlight I use textWrangler for all my text editing needs.  I abhor textEdit.  The problem comes when I search spotlight if I stop at text and hit enter then textEdit will launch.  I want to remove textEdit from my spotlight without deleting the app itself.\nI know I can keep a folder from being indexed.  But I want a specific app/file to not be included.\nAnd I know the simple answer is just \"don't type text\".  But that isn't really an answer.  I don't want to think to type.\n\nA: Yes, you can exclude a specific application from Spotlight search results from its Privacy pane in OS X Yosemite.\nAlong with TextEdit I have TextWrangler and Sublime Text 2 installed under OS X Yosemite.  If in Spotlight I type text the listed order is:\n\n\n*\n\n*TextEdit\n\n*TextWrangler\n\n*Sublime Text 2\n\n\nIf I go to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy and drag and drop the TextEdit application bundle onto the list area of the Privacy pane and close System Preferences and go back to Spotlight and type text the listed order is now:\n\n\n*\n\n*TextWrangler\n\n*Sublime Text 2\n\n\nSo, just do as I did and it solves your issue.\n\nA: At least on Yosemite, it looks to me like Spotlight should learn by what you select. So that if you start typing text it will list several possible matches. For me it listed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text 3\n\n*TextEdit\n\n*TextWrangler\n\n\nIndicating Spotlight knows my preference for Sublime. I tried selecting TextWrangler instead, and on subsequent searches, TextWrangler was the first item. \nAdditionally, you could type tw to more specifically request TextWrangler\nNote: I have used LaunchBar.app because it has always had these types of features. I think that I may have used LB during Mac OS X 10.0 BETA.  I still use many of LaunchBar's advanced features, but when I am on someone else Mac, I find I get along quite well with just Spotlight.\n\nA: You could move the textEdit application to an another folder (it can be a folder inside the Applications folder).\nThen you add this folder under the Privacy tab in Spotlight preferences (inside System Preferences. You add the folder by clicking on the \"+\" in the Privacy tab and choosing the folder you placed textEdit in (it is also possible to drag-and-drop the folder into the Privacy tab).\nNow Spotlight should exclude textEdit (and all other files/applications placed in that folder) from future searches.\nIf you need some screenshots on how to do this, please refer to this article: Link to article .\n\nA: Couldn't you just type \"wrang\" instead?\nAlso, third party replacements like LaunchBar or Alfred would let you define what results appear first when you type your choice of text. These also let you blacklist some search results.\n\nA: This is an answer for the situation where you deleted an application, but it's still showing up in Spotlight searches.\nGo to the Trash folder in Finder. Right click > Delete Immediately.\nIt will no longer show up in Spotlight.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade my iMac to Lion 10.7? I have a late 2006 iMac which I would like to upgrade to mac os x  10.7. What options are available to me, such as download or DVD, and where can I buy it from? Will the seller deliver it to my location in Amman, Jordan?\n\nA: OSX 10.7 Lion was not sold on DVD, the first retail OSX version to do so. You can obtain it through three methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update your system to 10.6.8 (combo update is best via Apple, or Software Update if you like) and then, using the Mac App Store, purchase a copy of Lion\n\n*Purchase Lion via the Apple Store website which will email you a download redemption code for Lion: http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion\n\n*Use eBay or another website to purchase an official Lion USB key, released for those who cannot download the product.

I've been having a very difficult time trying to get Windows 8.1 running alongside OS X Yosemite and it's starting to become a real pain. I initially attempted to burn the Windows 8.1 ISO onto several DVDs, with all attempts falling short resulting in \"Burn failed due to a medium write error\".\nSo I read up on how to burn the ISO onto a USB via Bootcamp Assistant, and apparently this model doesn't allow for it. I tried to use some of the work arounds which only caused errors and the software failing to run. I then got the ISO burned via Rufus and installed rEFInd which showed the USB as a Windows disk. Selecting it just caused a \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key\" screen and now I'm completely out of ideas.\nSo, what can I do at this point? I've just used up the last DVD trying to burn with the same error.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Here are the steps I use to install Windows without needing to burn to a DVD or flash drive. Keep in mind that the final product will NOT be a virtual machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install VirtualBox from http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.28/VirtualBox-4.3.28-100309-OSX.dmg. Make sure it installs the command line tools.\n\n*Once installed, open it and create a new VM by clicking \"New\" on the top left.\n\n*Select the type to be \"Microsoft Windows\", and select the version as \"Windows 8.1 (64 bit)\", then give it a name of your choosing. Click \"Continue\"\n\n*Click continue again (it won't matter how much RAM you give it for this process).\n\n*Select \"Do not add a virtual hard drive\". We will be creating one on our own for our purposes. Click \"Create\", then \"Continue\".\n\n*Now we have to open the Terminal. Type the following command: diskutil list. From the list of disks, make a note of the disk identifier in the last column that belongs to the 30GB partition you created for Windows. We will need this in the next step\n\n*Run the command sudo chown $USER /dev/disk#s#. Replace disk#s# with the identifier from earlier. Enter your password and push return. Also run sudo chown $USER /dev/disk#s1. Use the same identifier, but replace the last number with a 1. Also run sudo chown $USER /dev/disk# using the first half of your identifier (minus the s# part).\n\n*Unmount the disk by typing diskutil unmount /dev/disk#s# again, using your identifier.\n\n*Now we have to create the disk for the VM to use for installation. Run the command VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/RawWinDisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk# -partitions 1,#. Replace \"disk#\" with the appropriate first half of the identifier from earlier, and replace the second # sign with the last number in your identifier.\n\n*Unmount the disk again diskutil unmount /dev/disk#s#, using your identifier.\n\n*Now you should have a \".vmdk\" file in your home folder. Go back into VirtualBox, select the VM you created, and click \"Settings\". Select the \"Storage\" tab, click on the \"SATA\" controller and click the second \"+\" sign directly to right of the controller (the hover text is \"Add Hard Disk).\n\n*(Note: Due to a fairly old bug, you can't command+tab away from the selection window we're about to create without VirtualBox bugging out and requiring a restart of the app. Try to complete this in one step) Click \"Choose existing disk\", and navigate to the VMDK we just created, which should be in your home folder. Click it and select \"Open\". Now you should see the newly added disk just below the \"SATA\" controller.\n\n*Click on \"Empty\" just below the \"IDE\" controller, check \"Live CD/DVD\", and click the little CD icon next to \"IDE Secondary\".\n\n*(Note: The same bug applies here. Try to do this in one step.) Click \"Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file...\", navigate to your ISO, and open it.\n\n*Start the VM and install windows on the 30G partition.\n\n*When the installation is done and you're logged in, shut down Windows and you should see the disk created by Windows appear on the desktop. You can get the Boot Camp drivers for your laptop from https://support.apple.com/downloads/DL1720/en_US/BootCamp5.1.5621.zip. Put this on a flash drive formatted as ExFAT or FAT so Windows can read it.\n\n*You should now be able to reboot into Windows by holding alt down, or selecting the disk in Startup Disk preferences.\n\n\nThis is a long process, but I believe I've covered all the steps involved... Let me know if anything goes wrong!\n\nA: Well honestly this can be done in 5 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a windows installer usb\n\n*Create a bootcamp partition\n\n*Install rEFInd\n\n*Install windows\n\n*Install Boot camp drivers\nthe steps are broken down here https://eraxe.com/windows-7-bootcamp/\n\nA: Yes it is, I installed Windows 8.1 on my 2009 MacBook Pro that way. \nHere's an in-depth How-To: \nhttp://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-8-1-on-mac-without-boot-camp/ \nAlternatively, view this thread: \nCreating A Bootable USB Of Windows 8.1 On OS X?\nIf you are still having trouble creating a readable USB drive, try forcing Bootcamp to create a USB: \nhttp://crshd.github.io/2014/11/16/Creating-Windows-USB-on-OSX/\nThe only thing it required was installing drivers found in packages available by downloading Apple's Bootcamp support software here: \nhttps://support.apple.com/downloads/boot%20camp\nAnd manually adding the drivers, either by launching each .exe or importing them from Device Manager.\n\nA: If using a VirtualBox to create the vmdk, check the version you are running. If you run VirtualBox >= 3.0, then check \"Use host I/O\" under SATA Controller to avoid errors when trying to start the virtual machine.\n\nA: The guide provided by William T Froggard did not actually work for me.\nI ran into several Problems which are too complicated to explain and after several days of research I still do not fully understand the reasons. (You can read my process over on my apple discussions post.)\nIf you are having problems getting Windows Bootcamp running without a USB-Stick I would highly recommend using this guide: Installing Windows 7 or 10 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive.\nI used that guide to install windows bootcamp on my early 2011 macbook pro 15\" and it worked perfectly.\nThe guide appears more complicated than it actually is and is very well written. \nFor those who don't understand all the code, dont worry, you basically just have to copy & paste everything.\n", "Q: How do I open an app in my new mac book pro I just bought a new mac book pro.  I am pretty sure I transferred my apps from my iPad to my mac book pro.  How do I open the apps now in my new mac book pro?  I can see all my apps in the iTunes library but when I double click on them, nothing happens.\nAny help is appreciated.\nThank you\n\nA: Please understand that iOS Apps are not supported by or built for OS X, therefore they will not run on your new MacBook Pro unfortunately.\nIf you take a look on the App Store, you should be able to find the OS X equivalents for the apps you'd like to use on your MBP - though you'd most likely have to purchase them again if they aren't free.\n\nA: Those apps are for iOS meaning iPad and iPhone only. They are designed for touch. To get apps that have an equivalent for OS X, go to the Mac App Store. The reason you see them in iTunes is because these are backups for your iPad. \n\n\n*\n\n*Click the  on your menu bar. (Top left)\n\n*Click App Store\n\n*Search for the apps you want\n\n\nIf not available on Mac, you can contact the developer to see if they have plans to make a corresponding Mac app. \n", "Q: Deleted (but not cleared) voicemails not visible on iPhone 5 Background:\nI have an iPhone 5, iOS 8.3, carrier Verizon, and I currently can't get voicemails because my saved voicemails are filling all the available space.\nI've found several articles about how to delete voicemails, such as the following:\nhttp://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-delete-all-voicemail-messages-on-iphone-in-ios-8/\nhttp://www.askdavetaylor.com/ios-8-actually-delete-voicemails-iphone/\nI've deleted the old voicemails, but I still cannot get new voicemails, so the deleted old ones are clearly still stored in a delete queue (as I've read they are supposed to be). The problem, though, is that I am apparently supposed to see a link to these deleted messages at the bottom of the Voicemail list.\nIt's not there -- there's just the short list of voicemails I saved, and then blank space.\nNow I'm stumped, since all the resources I've found just assume the deleted messages will be accessible in this way.\nQuestion:\nAre there any relevant settings I could change to make the deleted messages queue visible (or would a Reset All Settings possibly do the trick)?\nIs there any other way to get to the messages and delete them (perhaps I should just contact Verizon)?\n\nA: I solved my problem by resetting the network settings from Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings (this course of action is actually recommended in the igeeksblog post I linked, but for the circumstance where Clear All is disabled rather than for the particular circumstance my phone was in). After this, I was able to call my phone and successfully leave a voicemail. I also tested out deleting a new voicemail, and it went into a Deleted Messages queue that is now visible at the bottom of my Voicemail Tab, as usual.\n", "Q: Changing Apple ID's I have been using my parents Apple ID for a few years now to buy music and apps but now I am going to college and I don't think they want me to continue buying music and other stuff with their money. If I switch over to my apple ID on ITunes and my IPhone, will I lose all the music that I have on my phone.\n\nA: You can ask them to set up Family Sharing, and then get them to invite your new Apple ID to the Family.\nOn the organizer iOS device, go to Settings > iCloud > Family and invite via Apple ID.\nThat way you can access all the content they (or you with their Apple ID) have purchased. \nYou can decide wether you want to share your purchase history with them, or hide specific items.\n\nYou will probably have to download apps and music again —I haven't tried it myself.

None of the advice posted on any website seems to work until I tried this and so far Mail is working fine\nhttps://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-mail-not-responding/ \ngive it a shot \n\nA: I have seen this issue quite a few times and none of the solutions seemed to work very long. The issue kept on returning. \nI do think I found a cause - although I only test 4-5 times. It seems to be an issue that keychain access is open - strangely enough :) Close keychain down and mail works fine again without deleting anything  \nConfirmed. Might have to wait 2 mins or so before the system processes the action of closing keychain.\n\nA: My Mail.app was freezing when I tried to quit it (forcing me to force quit it) and it was also not letting me select folders (it just showed the same partial list of my email).  I tried https://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-mail-not-responding/ to no avail.  Believe it or not, what finally worked was:\n\n\n*\n\n*force quit Mail.app\n\n*turn of Airport so my Mac was disconnected from the internet\n\n*relaunch mail\n\n*quit Mail.app again (this time it worked)\n\n*relaunch Mail.app\n\n*turn Airport back on again\nFrom that point on, Mail.app worked normally.  I think the issue was actually that it was trying to check or sync mail in one of my accounts and getting stuck.  The key step was probably #4, because if Mail.app could quit, then it was no longer caught in whatever infinite loop it was trying to do.\nIncidentally, I went to Window->Connection Doctor and discovered an old SMTP server that was spinning forever.  I deleted it in Mail->Preferences->Accounts->Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)->Edit SMTP Server List... then clicking on the bad server and clicking the [-] minus button on the left.  I don't think it was being used, but it's a good idea to not let those hang around, because Apple's interface for dealing with SMTP always made things very confusing.\n\nA: On my installation, Mail hanged whenever I tried to view the inbox. Deleting ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/ or ~/Library/Mail/ didn't help, but when I moved a single message from my inbox to another mailbox in Gmail's web interface, Mail stopped hanging. When I moved the message back to the inbox, Mail started hanging again. I don't know what about that message caused the hang though.\n\nA: I use the Mail client under OSX 10.10.3 and tend to let the system run for long stretches.\nThe other day, I determined that I wasn't receiving messages, and the situation deteriorated to where sent messages were sitting in the Outbox.\nSolution was to Restart the Mac.\n", "Q: Which graphics cards or integrated GPUs support metal?

Can my iMac take over with all the bells and whistles of a business phone system?\n\nA: Yes you can do just that. You could use an SIP line. There are hundreds of phone companies which offer SIP phone services (also called VoIP). Some internet provider also give you the access to the SIP configuration so you can handle your calls the way you like.\nCheck with your provider if they use SIP for your phone line and if so they could actually let you manage your phone calls with your own software.\nThen you would have to install one of the SIP apps to handle your calls and even configure the way your calls are redirected or answered depending on the time of day and other parameters.\nA list of SIP server software is available on wikipedia. Asterisk is the most common one is free and quite full-featured. There is a host of visual interfaces to help you with the administration and operations of SIP lines through asterisk, you can also find entire distributions dedicated to asterisk.\n\nIf installing and configuring your own SIP setup sounds like too much trouble some providers will have many features like:\n\n\n*\n\n*multiple phone numbers\n\n*multiple phone calls per number (incoming and/or outgoing)\n\n*auto forward\n\n*redirection after x tones\n\n*call transfer\n\n*conferencing\n\n*call monitoring\n\n*welcome menu: \"Welcome to My Global Company. For department press 1...\"\n\n*auto attendant: \"If you know the extension of the person you would like to speak to, you can enter it now\"\n\n*announcements: \"Welcome to MGC. Please wait while we connect your call\"\n\n\nThe level of service depends on the provider you chose. But the advantage of using a standard VoIP service is that you can move your setup to a new company, add lines from multiple companies and do whatever you like if you setup your PBX yourself.\n\nIf you want to use a normal phone there are SIP converters which can be installed between your internet provider's router and your phone. There are also full featured SIP phones.\nSome phones let you use both, your normal land line and multiple SIP accounts, for example I use one similar to this one:\n\nOther phones have a phone standard integrated which let you setup call redirections and other features.\n\nThere is also skype as already answered here.\nThey offer a very simple package but it is severely limited in comparison to an SIP installation.\nThere are multiple phones available to use skype like a normal land line (note: these are not compatible with the standard SIP protocol)\nYou can subscribe to a skype number to receive standard phone calls directly to your skype account. So people will be able to call that number without having to use skype on their end.\nBut when it comes to managing multiple lines or setups with multiple extensions skype is not made fo that. \n\nA: Skype is one of the most mature VOIP systems, and very much OS X version independent.\nThe Telephone service it offers is superb at very reasonable pricing.\nYou do not need extra hardware, as it can be installed on your existing laptop and smart phones.\n\nIf you prefer old fashion phones you can heave that.\nNo special setups, or dealing with OS X. Just install Skype.\nAnd if you feel like, you can have Video calling/conferencing calls as well.\n\nNo programing required as with other systems (SIP)\n\n What Do I Need To Know To Use Asterisk?\nThe Asterisk framework itself is built by developers for\ndevelopers. If you want to create applications and solutions with\nAsterisk you will need a working knowledge of Linux, script\nprogramming, networking and telephony.\n\nNot that it is important or matter but Skype is owned and supported by Microsoft, so you can be rest assured it will be always updated.\nFor more specific features like call forwarding, voice messages, ect.. see Skype support\nYou might be also interested in \"Skype for Business\" version.\nI found this 3 Years old article what it takes to set up SIP.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade MacBook Pro 13\" with HDD I'm planning to buy MacBook Pro 13\" 256GB SSD but i find it too expensive. I thought that it would be better if i buy 128gb SSD and upgrade it with an HDD storage. Is that possible? If not, is Apple still selling the old MBP?\n\nA: The latest MacBook Pro 13\" (MacBookPro12,1) comes with a special internal HD interface based on PCIe and uses a special form factor for the SSD. Check the ifixit replacement guide how it looks like. This replacement guide shows a MacBook Pro 2014 but the SSD in the recent model looks similar.\nSo internally there is neither space nor an appropriate interface to upgrade it with HDD storage.\nThe last MacBook Pro 13\" with a SATA interface and an HDD is the MacBookPro9,2. Check the link in the answer provided by Tuan Anh Tran where to purchase it. \n\nA: The old Macbook Pro is still available on Apple Store.\n", "Q: New Battery for my Vintage MacBook I need a new Battery for my late 2008 MacBook but Apple consider it as Vintage so stopped producing it.\nI searched my new battery on eBay and I've found two alternatives at, more or less, the same price:\n\n\n*\n\n*Original battery, never used but more than a year old (so it remained more than a year in his box).\n\n*Compatible Battery, so produced by who knew with who what but most recent.\n\n\nSo my question is: Is better a brand new compatible battery or an original but old one?\n\nA: Lithium cells degrade over time so getting a new cell is always better three years shelf life or worse. Worse, if the part falls into deep discharge, it will be ruined. I have no issue with old batteries but I charge them up to 50% every 6 months to avoid deep discharge.\nWhen you can get a cell that you know was put into long term storage properly, then buy from the vendor that you trust most. In this case, you're rolling the dice that the Apple part was made towards the end of the production run and not the beginning. You always have to do extra work with aftermarket parts, since some manufacturers cut corners and are even unsafe.\n\nHere's Apple's take on this: http://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\nStore it half-charged when you store it long term.\nIf you want to store your device long term, two key factors will affect the overall health of your battery: the environmental temperature and the percentage of charge on the battery when it’s powered down for storage. Therefore, we recommend the following:\nDo not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power down the device to avoid additional battery use.\n\n*Place your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less than 90° F (32° C).\n\n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50% every six months.\n\n*Depending on how long you store your device, it may be in a low-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After it’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with the original adapter before you can use it.\n\n", "Q: Any way to make swipe up and down work consecutively? In Mountain Lion I could swipe up with three fingers to see all windows and then swipe down without lifting my fingers to go back to the normal screen.\nFrom Mavericks, that does not work. I have to lift my fingers and then swipe down to go back to the normal screen. This takes more time and inconvenient.\nIs there any way to make it work as was in the Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Try the F3 button (for Exposé). Maybe you'd like the experience better. Now it is two key presses instead of needing to lift your fingers off the trackpad/ keyboard.\n", "Q: How to stop cursor blinking in Pages I am using Pages '09 on Mac OSX 10.6 (SnowLeopard) and would like to stop cursor blinking. For TextEdit, this was possible by setting\ndefaults write -g NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriod 100000\n\nfrom the Terminal, but this seems to have no effect on Pages. So I would really appreciate any hints or ideas on how to stop cursor blinking.\n\nA: NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriod is outdated. As of 10.9, OS S now has separate variables for ON and OFF times. 1000 represents one second. The following 2 commands can be used:\ndefaults write -g NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriodOn -float 1000\n\nand\ndefaults write -g NSTextInsertionPointBlinkPeriodOff -float 1000\n\nThese numbers will set the on blink to 1 second and the off blink to one second (default).\n", "Q: Is it possible to customize invitation email? I'm a newbie with OS X Server and specially with Profile Manager.\nI have already managed to make enrollment work, but I'm wondering if it is possible to change the template of the invitation email since it is pretty awful and leaves no space for branding or anything else.\n\nA: Go to your HD > Applications > Server.app\nRight Click > Show Package Contents\nGo to Contents > ServerRoot > usr > share > devicemgr > backend > app > views > emailer\nOpen the email_profile-multipart.erb file in your IDE of choice, and make your style edits to the HTML email.\n", "Q: How do you get a clickable path to a file or folder? I already saw a lot of questions and answers about how to copy the path of a file or folder using Automator.\nI personally like to use the copy option under the action menu on top of your finder because this will give you a path which can be used as a link:\n\nYou can paste this link in your e-mail. It's clickable so the receiver can click it and the exact location of the file will be opened.\nBut... does anybody know if there is a way to copy this path automatically in an e-mail message using Automator? \nI know how to create an e-mail in Automator but I can only copy the 'readable' path in it, which can't be clicked... \n\nA: You might want to consider using a scripting language to do this. I've created a simple JavaScript for Automation program that can do the job (it can also be fairly easily replicated in AppleScript):\nfinder = Application('Finder')\nfinder.includeStandardAdditions = true\nfile = finder.chooseFile()\npath = String(file).replace(' ', '%20')\n\nYou could then use the path variable to create a new OutgoingMessage in Mail.\nAlternatively, you could use this as a \"Run Javascript\" block in Automator, then use its result in a New Mail Message (in which case you would need to append return path to then end of the script).\n", "Q: Macbook pro Battery Question Is it normal for the maximum mAH to fluctuate by 100's from time to time for a 2012 macbook pro?\n\nA: I've never been concerned with such a small measurement error.

Perhaps something is concerning but the small fluctuation you report isn't concerning to me.\n", "Q: Is it possible to track installed apps usage on iOS devices using MDM profiles? I need to track not enterprise distributed apps, but all other apps installed on the device.\nI need the information on when each app was launched, and for how long it was opened.\nAs I see so far, it is not possible, but maybe I am missing something...\n\nA: I think your conclusion is correct. This information is not included in the MDM Protocol Reference and therefore isn't available through MDM.\nThe only way I can think of would be to side-load (using an Enterprise Distribution certificate/profile) an app that uses private APIs to monitor such activity and report back. Not recommended and against the Developer Program T&Cs I believe...\n", "Q: Default ubuntu to boot in startup manager causes ubuntu to not work anymore I have installed ubuntu alongside os x. I can start it by pressing the option key during startup and choose the correct disk. Everything works.\nNow I want to default the ubuntu disk. That works by pressing \"Control\" while choosing the disk in the startup manager and pressing enter.\nMy mac now boots default to ubuntu. But it does not work anymore. The login screen appears, but neither keyboard nor touchpad work. Also if I plug in an usb mouse, it does not light up.\n\nA: A couple of things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset your NVRAM since the startup disk is stored there\n\n*set the desired startup disk from OS X (or by blessing it manually from OS X) after the NVRAM clear\n\n*use a third party boot manager - Boot Runner is about the best there is, but you have lots of options from free to open-source\n\n", "Q: Eject button in Finder does not work Every now and then (it seems to me especially after TM backups, but that is about the only reason I plug them in), I am unable to eject and external hard drive by clicking the eject button in Finder (it simply does nothing).

However, this behaviour is not consistent.\n", "Q: MacBook Air won't start up, won't enter secure mode and repair in Disk Utility Unfortunately some data was downloading and my Mac got stuck, so I forcefully power it off. After that, I couldn't enter the login screen, because the loading bar was stuck.\nI tried to enter safe mode, but with no success. After that, I entered single user mode and entered some command to repair disk, but it scanned for 10 minutes and failed.\nI finally managed to enter recovery/repair mode with Disk Utility (previously no disk was listed in menu), and clicked 'First Aid'. This failed after one second with something like 'invalid node'.

Try the fsck on that, and if you're still getting the \"Resource busy\" error, try to unmount it, either in the Disk Utility in recovery, or by using diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk# and trying again.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Try this http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/steps-take-when-your-mac-wont-start-3423817/\nYou could start with resetting the NVRAM. Just try a few things from the above URL—might help to resolve the issue.\n\nReset the NVRAM, because why not?\nIn the PowerPC days, we talked about resetting the PRAM. On modern Macs, the real term is resetting the NVRAM. The name refers to special memory sections on your Mac that store data that persists even when the Mac is shut off, like volume settings, screen resolution, and similar options.\nResetting that data isn't harmful, but quite frankly it's also rarely genuinely useful. But man, at this point, it can't hurt.\nYou might need to grow an extra finger or two for this one, or have a friend help you out. Hold down all of these keys: Command, Option, P and R, and turn on the Mac. Keeping holding the keys down until you hear the Mac restart again. Apple says to let it restart just the one time; I usually listen for a second reboot, and then release the keys.\nIn some cases, after performing this step, your Mac will restart normally. In other cases, you might instead see a progress bar on startup. If the progress bar fills up and then the Mac starts up, you're probably good to go. In some cases we've seen, however, the Mac shuts down at around the halfway point in the progress bar.\n\n", "Q: How to disable emojis system-wide? I never want to see an emoji again.\nI have seen instructions for disabling them in specific apps, but I want a nuclear option.\nHow do I get rid of them for all apps, all users, all contexts?\nI'm on OSX 10.10 Yosemite\n\nA: You might be able to remove Apple's Color Emoji font, but you cannot remove it with FontBook. Instead, go to /System/Library/Fonts/ and drag \"Apple Color Emoji.ttf\" to the Trash. You must authenticate yourself as an administrator to do this. I haven't tested this, and I don't know if your computer will catch fire.\n", "Q: why my phone is slow and stop working suddenly? I have moved to Malaysia recently. unfortunately my iphone 5s is working slow even sometimes when I press home button the screen stays black ( looks like switched off ) and I have to keep pressing home and lock button for couple minutes to get my phone back. or for example when I want to get out of an apps my phone freezed and stays like that for 10 seconds.\nthe available storage is 3.4GB and IOS version is 8.3.\nThanks guys\n\nA: This likely has to do with your carrier settings. Have you gone to settings > general > about to check for a carrier update?\nIf you don't see \"new carrier settings available\" after visiting general, plug your iPhone into iTunes, and manually check for carrier settings.\nThe next thing would be to go to general > reset and reset your network settings.\nIf that does not work, back up your phone to iTunes and preform a full restore. This takes a while, but should eliminate most if not all stubborn freeze/slowdown issues.\nIf it does not, go to settings > general > reset and reset all settings. You won't lose data, but will have to set up your preferences again.\n", "Q: Active sync issues with 8.3 - Calendar items missing I'm responsible for many iOS devices that sync to Exchange using Activesync.  I see a problem with iOS 8.3 where appointments randomly are missing from the local device. \nIs anyone aware of this issue or know how I can resolve this?\n\nA: You can usually resolve this sort of issue by contacting Apple support and getting a debug profile/build to load onto one device and track down the iOS errors and correlate them with the exchange server logs.\nAlternate methods would include using Xcode to look at the logs on the iOS device if you are lucky enough to have relevant logs in the main log. My guess is you'll need specific logging on both sides to troubleshoot and then address this.\nWhile you're on with Apple support, ask if they have a current exchange configuration guide - often you can get suggested settings rather than having to systematically change things server side which is never fun even if you have a development server to test with. Testing in production is not something I like to even consider when you can get at the logs and know what's happening with a known amount of work.\n", "Q: No entry grey screen with spinner with new SSD My hard drive bit the dust rather spectacularly on my 2011 15\" MBP. Luckily, I have a model without torx screws, so I popped it open, put in a 240 GB SSD I had lying around, and did and Internet boot into Lion recovery. \nI used Disk Utility to format the drive, one partition, Mac OS extended, encrypted. It downloaded Lion, but after that first reboot, I've got a grey screen with a no entry sign and a spinner. It's not changed for 20 minutes. \nIs there anything I can do? Is it not possible to us an SSD? I have other hard drives. Was encryption the mistake? \n\nA: Posting this from my working OS! The problem was with selecting encryption when formatting the drive. I reformatted without, painstakingly downloaded Lion again and all seems to be working fine now.\n\nA: That means that the computer can't find a boot image.\nPower off and then boot with option held down. If any bootable volumes are connected, you can choose them.\nIf no bootable volumes are connected, make one (internet recovery or use another Mac) and then connect it.\n", "Q: Apple Watch pairing keeps failing I just see this screen below. I've tried to begin pairing multiple times and I get past the scanning screen and sometimes past the T&Cs but no further. The watch hasn't been paired before.\n\n\nA: After power cycling the watch it offered to reset to factory settings. Then it failed once more before working the next time.\nAlso the first time it failed might have been because I was interrupted by a phone call.\n", "Q: Which app distribution method I must use for this app? Im making an app for my enterprise but we dont know yet which ditribution method to use. The app is for employees, <-- This is not a problem, we can use Enterprise Membership, the problem is that the app is also going to be used by the family of the employees, so Enterprise is not an option because we wanted to upload the an into the intranet but that way the families couldnt have access to the app.\nSo my question is: With enterprise account, we can upload the app into the public enterprise page? Or for this situation, is better to use a normal Developer Account and publish the app into the App Store?\nThanks.\n\nA: The iOS Enterprise agreement has the following clause:\n\nDistribute Provisioning Profiles only to Your Employees and only in conjunction with Your \n  Internal Use Applications for the purpose of developing and testing Your Internal Use \n  Applications; \n\nIn addition it states:\n\nAllow Your Customers to use Your Internal Use Applications\n  on Deployme\n  nt Devices\n  , but only \n  (i) on Your physical premises and/or on Your Permitted Entity’s physical premises, or (ii) in other \n  locations, provided all such use is under the direct supervision and physical control of Your \n  Employees or Permitted Users (e.g., a sal\n  es presentation to a Customer)\n\nHence for your user base, it would would not be right to distribute apps with enterprise license. Distribute the app through the app store with some kind of authentication mechanism.\nYou have also host some kind of registration mechanism on your intranet, where the employees would generate user IDs and passwords for themselves and their families.\n\nA: Another way of distributing apps is by using a mobile device management software. You can push apps to any device which is managed by the MDM. Usually what MDM does is a complete device management but some vendors like Hexnode MDM provides the app distribution feature alone. \n", "Q: Disable icloud permanently to prevent locked devices and lost data Is there a way to prevent employees from setting up icloud accounts?\nThe issue we have is employees set up an icloud account then leave the business and the phone become a costly paperweight because there is no way to reset the phone due to the icloud account.\nIf possible it would be nice to disable icloud all together to avoid lockouts and mixing of personal and work data.\n\nA: This is really two questions, but let's get brief answers and then you can ask a follow on question if one topic needs more details.\n\n\n*\n\n*MDM profile can only disable saving data from managed apps to iCloud. If your employee buys the app themselves and then adds company data to that app, you have no technological policy recourse and need to handle that with personnel policy, training and HR.\n\n*You can contact Apple and provide proof of purchase as the original purchaser to recover any locked device. Going forward, buy all devices from Apple directly as part of the DEP for Business or Education program. https://www.apple.com/business/dep/ That way you can unlock devices yourself and they automatically check in to your MDM. Again, write HR policy to let employees know they are responsible for the cost of the equipment they don't rerun and the cost of recovery efforts if they don't unlock the devices. Now IT has nothing to do other than fill out the paperwork and let HR and legal handle cases where theft and rage quit users don't follow the policies and procedures you educated them about while they were employees.\nYou can also disable iCloud altogether, but most deployments I've seen have decided to not do that except for pre-teen children and cart deployment use where each device is managed with Apple Configurator and wiped regularly.\n", "Q: Running an OS off an external drive I'm looking to do away with my Boot Camp partition. Now I've bought a 2 TB external drive, and I was wondering if it's possible to either install a Boot Camp partition onto the external drive, or failing that, how much of a performance drop I'll see if I install a VM via Parallels Desktop onto the external drive.\nIt's a USB 3 external drive.\nMy Mac is a MacBook Pro late '13, 2.4 GHz Intel i5, 8 GB of DDR3 RAM\n\nA: It seems to be possible to install Windows 7/8 to an external drive but a lot of work is necessary to overcome Boot Camp/Windows 7/8 restrictions.\nThe following guide is shamelessly stolen at bleeptobleep.blogspot.de.\nAll credits go to the the respective  persons/groups of persons.  \nTo keep the formatting and improve readability i didn't choose the quote tags.\nMac: Install Windows 7 or 8 on an external USB3 or Thunderbolt drive without using bootcamp\nIntroduction\nAfter I received my new iMac with a 3 TB Fusion Drive, I was disappointed when I realized that Bootcamp was not running on this model and prevented me from installing Windows on it. I wanted to take advantage of the powerful iMac hardware to play games but I couldn't.\nThere are a few ways of working around this limitation, but I found most of them quite complex and most of the time they required formatting the internal hard drive or repartitioning it and go for a brand new installation of Mac OS X. I was not comfortable with that.\nBut there is another way, and that is to install Windows on an external hard drive, using either USB or Thunderbolt. Personally I used a Lacie Rugged 1 TB drive that has both USB3 and Thunderbolt connectors. Both work very well.\nThis guide may interest you if:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have an internal hard drive of more than 2TB and you can't run bootcamp at all (like late 2012 iMacs with a 3TB drive)\n\n*You have limited space or you don't want to dedicate disk space on your internal hard disk drive to a Windows installation\n\n\nWhat this guide will make you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will make you erase all your data from your external USB3/Thunderbolt hard drive\n\n*It will make you install Windows on your external USB3/Thunderbolt hard drive\n\n*It will make you install bootcamp drivers\n\n\nWhat this will not make you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will not make you modify anything on your internal Mac hard drive\n\n*It will not make you use or install the bootcamp assistant\n\n*It will not activate the Preference Pane for the default boot drive. You have to boot by pressing the ALT key to manually select your boot drive each time you want to boot Windows.\n\n\nWhat you'll need\n\n\n*\n\n*An external hard drive with a USB3 and/or Thunderbolt connector. This drive will be formatted so ensure you saved your files before going further. You can use either an SSD drive or a classic hard drive.\n\n*A Windows 7 or 8 install DVD or ISO (check whether to install 32 or 64 bits versions based on your Bootcamp drivers) and the corresponding Windows serial number.\n\n*One of the following:\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X with a Windows 7 or 8 Virtual Machine (use VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop for example. Note: VMWare Fusion seems to have some issues with Thunderbolt and USB3. Plug your drive to a USB2 enclosure or hub to work around this -it worked for me-, or use another VM software) → Read the important note below\n\n*A PC running Windows 7 or 8 → Read the important note below\n\n\n*Windows AIK (free) running on your Virtual Machine or on your PC, or just the imagex.exe file (the rest of the Windows AIK package is not needed)\n\n*\n\n*Download imagex.exe\n\n*Download Windows AIK 7 or Windows AIK 8 (this download and installation is not required if you have already downloaded imagex.exe)\n\n\n*Bootcamp drivers for your Mac. You can get these either by running bootcamp from your Mac (Applications > Utilities > Bootcamp) or, if like me you have a 3TB drive and can't run bootcamp at all, use the direct download links here.\n\n*A USB stick to store your bootcamp drivers\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If your Mac has a 64 bits processor, your Windows Virtual Machine on OSX, your Windows installation on your PC and your Windows DVD/ISO must also be in 64 bits!\nStep by Step guide\nStep 1: Get the install.wim file\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a Windows ISO file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the ISO\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're on OS X: double click on the ISO file\n\n*If you're on on Windows 7: Use a software like Virtual Clone Drive (free)\n\n*If you're on Windows 8: double click on the ISO file\n\n\n*Open the mounted drive, then go to the \"sources\" folder and locate the \"install.wim\" file. Save this file to C:\\wim\\ on your Windows installation or virtual machine.\n\n\n*If you have a Windows DVD: open the \"sources\" folder on the DVD and locate the \"install.wim\" file. Save this file to C:\\wim\\ on your Windows installation or virtual machine.\nIMPORTANT: If instead of a \"install.wim\" file, you have \"install.esd\", you can not continue this step by step guide. And an ESD file can not be converted into a WIM file. So you must get a version of the Windows installation DVD/ISO that has an install.wim file. \nStep 2: Clean, partition and format your external hard drive\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Windows installation or virtual machine, plug in your external hard drive (can be plugged using USB2, USB3 or Thunderbolt at this stage)\n\n*Open the command prompt in administrator mode (cmd.exe). To run it in administrator mode, right click on cmd.exe > Run as admin.\n\n*Type the following and hit enter to open the disk partitioner utility:\ndiskpart\n\n*Type the following and hit enter to list your drives:\nlist disk\nThis will display a list of disks mounted on your computer or virtual machine. Make sure your drive is listed here before you continue.\n\n*Identify the disk ID of your external hard drive. Replace # by your real external disk ID in the command below:\nselect disk #\n\n*Clean all partitions by typing the following (warning: this will erase all data from your external drive!):\nclean\n\n*Type the following to use MBR as partitioning format:\nconvert mbr\n\n*Create the boot partition by typing the following followed by the enter key:\ncreate partition primary size=350 \nThis will create a 350MB partition on your external drive\n\n*Format the partition in FAT32 by typing the following:\nformat fs=fat32 quick\n\n*Set this partition to active by typing:\nactive\n\n*Assign a letter to mount this partition. We will use letter B in our example. If B is already used on your PC, replace B by any other available letter:\nassign letter=b \nWindows will detect a new drive and probably display a pop-up. Ignore that.\n\n*Create the Windows installation partition using all the remaining space available on the external drive by typing the following:\ncreate partition primary\n\n*Format the new partition in NTFS:\nformat fs=ntfs quick\n\n*Assign a letter to mount this partition. We will use letter O in our example. If O is already used on your PC, replace O by any other available letter:\nassign letter=o\nWindows will detect a new drive and probably display a pop-up. Ignore that.\n\n*Exit the disk partitioner utility by typing:\nexit\nStep 3: Deploy the Windows installation image\n\n\n*\n\n*Still using the command prompt in admin mode (you didn't close it, did you? ;) ), locate the imagex.exe file mentioned in the \"What you'll need\" section and access its folder. In our example, we have put this file in C:\\imagex\\imagex.exe\n\n*Your Windows installation ISO has probably several installation options in it. So in order to identify the right one, type in the following:\nimagex.exe /info C:\\wim\\install.wim\n\n*Now identify the INDEX number of the installation that you wish to deploy. You will use it in the next step.\n\n*Type the following and hit enter. Replace 1 with the INDEX you identified in the previous step. Also remember to replace o: with the letter you have chosen in the previous step:\nimagex.exe /apply C:\\wim\\install.wim 1 o: \nThis will take some time. The Windows installation image is being deployed to your external drive\n\n*Once done, type the following to create the boot section (remember to replace o: and b: with the letters you've chosen in the previous step):\no:\\windows\\system32\\bcdboot o:\\windows /f ALL /s b:\n\n*\n\n*If you get an error message saying that you can't run this program on your PC, then most probably you are running on a 32 bits installation of windows and you're trying to deploy a 64 bits install. This means you did not read the important notes in the beginning of this guide ;)\n\n*If you get an error message on the options that can be used with the BCDBOOT command, then it's because you're installing Windows 7, and the /f option is not supported. If that is the case, remove /f ALL from the command and retry.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Boot from your external drive and install Windows\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your external drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've done all the previous steps from a Windows PC, unplug your external drive from your PC and plug it to your Mac, either on a USB3 or a Thunderbolt port.\n\n*If you've done all the previous steps from your Mac using a Virtual Machine, ensure the external drive is plugged in to a USB3 or Thunderbolt port. Using USB2 should also work but you'll get very poor performance so I don't recommend doing that.\n\n\n*Reboot your Mac and once the bootup sound is over, immediately press the ALT (option) key and release it only when the boot drives selection screen appears. If you did not get the boot drives selection screen, reboot and try again. The timing to press the ALT (option) key is quite short. It must not be too early or too late.\n\n*On the boot selection screen, choose \"Windows\" using the arrow keys on your keyboard, then press enter.\n\n*The Windows installation starts. Follow the on-screen instructions as normal. The installation program will restart your computer one or 2 times. Don't forget to press ALT (option) right after the bootup sound, and boot on Windows again each time to continue the installation.\n\n\nStep 5: Install bootcamp drivers\n\n\n*\n\n*Once the Windows installation is complete, plug in the USB stick where you stored the bootcamp drivers (see \"what you'll need\" section), open it and right click on \"setup.exe\" and select \"Run as admin\". Follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n*\n\n*If you have an error saying that you can't run this program on this PC, obviously you have installed a 32 bits version of Windows and the bootcamp drivers for your Mac are made for a 64 bits version. You have to restart the whole guide and make sure to get a 64 bits version of Windows this time!\n\n\n*Once the bootcamp drivers are all installed, reboot and press ALT (option) after the bootup sound to boot on Windows again. And Voilà, you have Windows installed on your USB3/Thunderbolt drive running on your Mac.\n\n*Now each time you want to boot on Windows, press and hold the ALT (option) key after the startup sound and select \"Windows\", then press Enter.\n\n\nCredits, sources and big thank you to:\ntweaks.com where I got the info on how to install Windows to go on a USB external drive\nChris F Caroll where I finally found where to download the bootcamp drivers without running bootcamp\nMacrumors forums for the very helpful forum members\nTo answer your second question about performance drop:\nI don't have a Boot Camp partition so i can't compare Windows Boot Camp to a Windows VM.\nBut i may give you a Mac <-> Mac VM comparison and single Windows 7/8 VM benchmarks:\nGeekbench 3 Benchmark:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac14,2 3.5 GHz i7 4 cores 8 threads 32 GB 10.9.5: single-core score: 4009 multi-core score: 14951\n\n*iMac14,2 3.5 GHz i7 2 (virtual) cores 4 GB 10.9.5 Parallels VM single-core score: 3870 multi-core score: 7127\n\n\nWindows Experience Index:\nWindows 7 Parallels VM, 2 (virtual) cores, 4 GB (WEI: 1.0-7.9):  \n\n\n*\n\n*Processor:        7.3\n\n*RAM:              7.9    \n\n*Graphics:         7.8\n\n*Gaming Graphics:  7.8\n\n*Prim.

While dismantling my 2011 MacBook Pro, I found that the bottom case place has an etching:\n\nWhat does it all mean? In particular, one part of it appears to be a date in the future. Is it, and if so what happens on that day? \n\nA: That's not likely an expiry date, as much as an end of cycle for manufacturing. The date April 24, 2012 bears no significance to the Macbook Pro. The 2011 Macbook Pro was the second last edition of the Macbook Pro line and was released in October 2011, as June 2012 saw the release of the Macbook Pro Retina line and the final Macbook Pro. If you were to open up a 2012 MBP, you would likely see a different date listed on the 604-2751-C part. Given the lead times to manufacture, it would make sense that there was no further production of the Macbook Pro bottom plate past that date.\n", "Q: How can I restore Maps app I would like to know how I can restore my mac Maps App with time machine back up.

I have bad blocks on the internal Hitachi hard disk in my 2009 era MacBook PRO. I am reformatting the disk with the zero-out option to remap those blocks, but when it comes time to restore the contents of the drive I am wondering whether it's really necessary to partition the disk given that I have no need for more than 1 partition. Please advise.\n\nA: If you zero out the drive, it means that you've completely erased the drive, partition map and all. The partition map tells the OS how a drive and its' space is used, and in order to use one to install and OS to or store data on, it needs at least 1 partition. If you've used OS X's built in Disk Utility \"Erase\" function, it asks for a new name to rewrite the new partition as, which means you shouldn't need to partition further. Additional partitions are useful if you ever plan on dual booting or want to keep certain data in a separate area of the drive.\nAlso on the note of wiping a drive in an attempt to get it working after it has bad blocks. It is generally not a good idea to do since it means that for one reason or another the data there has gotten corrupted. It could have been particulate or dust on the platter, a head crash, driverboard failure, or any number of things. Once a drive is found to have bad blocks at all, I would advise backing up or recovering as much data as possible and replacing it as soon as possible.\n", "Q: How can I get Windows to install in Legacy (BIOS) boot on my mid-2012 MBP I've got a 13\" mid-2012 MBP running OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite. I've recently repaved it with a fresh install and now I'm getting round to Bootcamp`ing it. I've installed Windows 8.1 in EFI boot mode and discovered the well documented issue with the sound card not working. Following various online guides to install Windows in legacy boot mode, I've held option at boot and selected \"Windows\" on the USB thumb drive that Bootcamp Assistant created but all I get is a black screen with a white blinking cursor. I've left it for 10 minutes but still nothing (some reports say it boots to the installer after a while).\nI believe the disk is hybrid MBR (due to Bootcamp Assistant), here's the output from fdisk\nGregs-MBP:~ greg$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0  \nPassword: \nDisk:   /dev/disk0  geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors] Signature:   0xAA55   Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>   \n2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  486812704] HFS+   \n3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 487222344 -    1269536] Darwin   Boot   \n4: 0B 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 488493056 -  488280064] Win95 FAT-32\n\nHow can I get Windows to install in legacy boot mode?\nNote, I previously had Windows 8.1 working fine (audio and everything) and if I remember correctly I just ran Bootcamp Assistant and followed the instruction, no trouble.\n\nA: Well I've finally found an answer: just use a Windows 8 install CD ROM with the standard 'install Windows 7 or later option' selected. Do not install Windows 8.1. It seems the problem is with the latter messing around Boot Camp normal procedures rendering audio and some other components unusable.\nWhere my MBP 13″ mid 2012 wouldn't complete my installation with Boot Camp before, now the installation starts in legacy via the CD, it just flows and at the end of it I get to install my version of the Boot Camp drivers found on the net and audio works fine.\nWhat might have influenced the whole process was that I accidentally erased my whole disk, had to start from the recovery over the internet (Command + R at startup) and reinstall Yosemite and my files through my Timemachine backup). Maybe it fixes something with my old recovery and EFI partitions, but I can't know for sure.\n", "Q: Incomprehensible information in system diagnostic report When I open Console app and go to the \"System diagnostic report\" I can see awdd files.

I have a 2011 13\" MacBook Pro. It has had no problems up until now. Suddenly, clicking won't work! I thought that it was the touchpad that wasn't working right, but then I connected a mouse and the problem still persists! Sometimes it doesn't want to click, and other times it won't stop clicking. I have gone online and tried everything that people have recommended but nothing works! \n\nA: To restore some functionality, go to System Preferences > Trackpad, and tick the box next to \"Tap to click\".\n\nIt's possible this is a software or driver issue. However:\nIf the trackpad does not depress with a \"click-clack\" noise when you push the lower left or right corner, it's possible you have a hardware issue: Something is preventing it from moving internally. On a 2011 MacBook Pro this can be caused by:\n• Battery swelling\n• Improperly adjusted Trackpad screw (movement over time can cause the screw to rotate)\n• Trackpad hardware failure\nTo diagnose the cause, inspect the bottom case of your MacBook Pro. Is the case swollen under the trackpad, either visibly or by touch? If so, your battery should be replaced immediately. \nIf the trackpad doesn't depress when pushed, it's most likely a stuck trackpad (screw adjustment) or a trackpad hardware failure.\nRepairing Disk Permissions can sometimes solve input issues. \nGo to Applications > Utilities > launch Disk Utility. From the First Aid tab, select your Hard Drive in the left field, then click the Verify Disk Permissions button. If you find errors, you will need to restart to repair them. \nRestart while holding down CMD + R, select Disk Utilities from the menu (if you aren't there already), select your Hard Drive from the left hand field, and then click Repair Disk Permissions. \nYou can also try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC), by using the procedure here: \n(From Link Below):\n• Portable Macs with non-removable batteries: Make sure the Mac is plugged in to AC power. On the built-in keyboard, press and hold the Shift, Option, and Control keys on the left side and press the power button. Release all the keys at once, and then turn the Mac on normally.\n• Portable Macs with removable batteries: Disconnect the AC power cord and remove the battery. Press the power button, hold it for 5 seconds, and then let go.

Also, it would still register right-click events (two fingers) and force-click events.\n\nA: Also for the 2016 Macbook Pro, this will happen frequently when the magic mouse II and the peripheral trackpad are simultaneously connected - happens to me all of the time. \nSwitching the mouse off returns the built-in trackpad to normal. HTH.\nIt just doesn't seem to like the trio of peripheral trackpad, in-built track-pad and magic mouse all connected at the same time.\n\nA: IF NONE OF THAT WORKS\nBUT and you can STILL scroll and move around, possibly even hard click twice which will pull up the dictionary..but still can not \"CLICK\" with your trackpad\nMAKE SURE your BLUETOOTH MOUSE (aka Magic Mouse) is NOT ON..... and no USB mouse is plugged in\nThe Magic Mouse was my issue, I accidentally turned it on while rummaging through my laptop bag.  I tried all the methods here and more...\nNOTE: SOME would seem to work momentarily because after a restart or lid close/open/sleep, the computer took a second to reconnect to the hidden mouse.

Visiting websites like Stack Overflow, golang.org, golang playground, or gnu website causes my computer to perform very poorly since it runs out of RAM.\nThis occurs on both Safari or Chrome. Some of those websites are and most of them use no flash or any other plug in as far as I can detect.\nWhat can be the reason for such a behaviour?\n\nA: I have found out that the reason was some adware, malware infected my web browsers. They were making network requests initiated without my permission.\nI have installed AdwareMedic and it completely solved my problem.\n\nA: Are you running on OSX Yosemite? There were some changes that allow the OS and by extension Safari to make use of your computers whole amount of RAM, the mantra being that unused RAM is being wasted. \nNot too sure what it means for a low RAM system, I would assume that apps would unload some data from the RAM when it is nearing full. \nKeep in mind that although the websites may seem straightforward, they are vastly more complex than even a year or two ago, so over time the amount of RAM needed with increase \n", "Q: Import RSS into iCal I have an online calendar in an RSS-format. Is is possible to import it into iCal and will it be kept synced automatically?\nAn example of such a calendar is: RSS-Calendar\n\nA: Generally speaking Calendar supports CalDAV and Exchange calendars. I am not certain what an \"rss-calendar\" is but if it can be converted to or supports CalDAV or Exchange calendar formats you are golden.\nI have not had to import a or subscribe to a calendar in quite a while so Calendar in the last couple of versions of Mac O/S may have some new supported formats. You may want to try just pointing Calendar to the URL of your \"rss-calendar\" and see what happens.\nThe other possibility is if you can export an ICAL compatible file that can then be imported into Calendar. It's not automatic syncing but it may be better than nothing.\n\nA: As you can see from the example you provided, RSS feeds are not meant for calendars. Instead, they are meant for use with an RSS reader (like Safari) that will display, in your example, dates in text format and provide a \"Read more...\" link that will direct you to the website. \nUnfortunately, there's not much you can do, because even converting the RSS feed for use with a calendar would mean you need to convert it every time the feed updates. \n", "Q: Send SMS/text messages from Windows through USB + iPhone?

I'm not sure if this is a fault with me or with apple. Can anybody help?\n\nA: If you have a valid US Apple ID, it should accept the US iTunes gift card.  It should not matter in which country you are physically.  I know because I do this myself.

Can anyone help me?\n\nA: I usually sync my iPhone with my Mac at home so testing it on my work PC does not give the option to mount the phone to sync music, pictures, etc. That said...\nIf I recall correctly you have to download and set up iTunes to sync with the PC in question. Then iTunes will mount (at least) the Pictures folder and allow you to copy things off of it manually if you so choose. (again going from memory, I may have a detail or two incorrect)\nIf your goal is to use your iPhone as an external storage device or to explore the contents of the phone then you will need a 3rd-party application like iPhone Explorer installed on your PC to have access to the iPhone's file system and to be able to copy files back and forth at will.\nI have always wanted to be able to just plug an iPhone in and use some of the available storage as you would a thumb drive. But Apple has chosen to not implement that functionality out of the box for some reason.\n", "Q: how to delete already imported pictures from iPhone in MacOS X Photos app? I can't find a way to delete previously imported photos from the iphone in the Photos app (Version 1.0 (209.52.0)). Note that there is a check box to delete picture right after import, but I am looking for a way to delete previously imported pictures without having to reimport them. Typically pictures are automatically imported via iCloud and so when I open the Photos app it does not make sense to reimport them. With iphoto it was possible but apparently not with the new photos app.\nSomeone earlier posted the same question and one solution was given: OS X - How do I remove photos from my iPhone using the Photos app after import?\nNonetheless this doesn't work for me, the delete button is not present in the import page. Most likely this feature disappeared with an upgrade. Moreover when I select images, the Image->Delete photo (translated from the french version) is grayed out. \n\nA: Have you tried using Image Capture?\nPlug in your phone.  Select it from Devices.  Select the photos, hit the little \"no\" icon (the circle with the line through it) near the bottom of the window, and delete the photo.  Also good to delete photos you don't even want in photos.\n\nA: If the identical images are already present in Photos (due to prior import from My Photo Stream, for example), it will not reimport them. It only imports new items. In fact, the button on the import screen in Photos says \"Import All New Photos\" if there are already-imported photos present on the device as well.\nThere is no way in Photos to remove already-imported photos from iPhone, like there was in iPhoto. The only way is to remove them by using the Photos app on the device itself.\n\nA: Try disabling iCloud Photo Library on your phone. I had this enabled and was wondering why the \"Delete items after import\" icon was missing and Image Capture showed a lock icon against all of the items and hid the delete button.\nOnce I disabled iCloud Photo Library, disconnected my phone, reconnected and restarted Photos and Image Capture, the delete icon reappeared.\nA workflow I do is to go back and make sure I reselect all of the photos, check \"delete items after import\" and re-import them again. I'll have duplicates in my album, but I feel safer that way.\nFurther reading: http://www.howtogeek.com/219092/why-cant-i-delete-photos-off-my-iphone-anymore/\n\nA: This is a problem. The new Photos app will re-import photos that were already imported via iCloud. You have to select them first and then the buttons are highlighted. If you check the \"delete from iPhone\" box, it will clean them off of the iPhone (good!) but then you will have duplicates in the Photos app (NOT good).\nThis wrinkle leave you with two options: Turn off iCloud and import them the old way or leave iCloud on and manually deleted photos from your iPhone.\n", "Q: My iPhone keeps switching on and off charge whilst charging, how do I fix it? When I charge my iPhone 4 on my laptop, it starts charging but then it keeps going on and off charging even though it's not touched.\nIt charges fine with a plug charger or with any computers I use at college.\nWhat things prevent a Mac from charging a connected iPhone so that charging can be resumed?\n\nA: Running this in terminal worked for me: (it will ask for your user's password)\nsudo killall -STOP -c usbd\n\nThis pauses the troublesome process instead of killing it altogether like other answers suggest. The difference is that macOS won't try to reopen it automatically and cause the issue again.\nRunning sudo killall -CONT usbd will resume the process, should anything require it.\nTested on: iPhone 7 (iOS 11) + MacBook Pro Late 2013 (10.13.6)\n\nBesides software issues, there's a good chance that the cable is at least partially damaged so it might work for dumb power chargers but not with a MacBook that also relies on the USB data pins.\n\nAlso this might happen when either device needs an update. I've been asked \"Install update to connect to device?\" before and if I don't accept, this issue happens.\n\nA: You probably have a buildup of lint/debris in the phone's charger (lightning) port. Use a plastic or wood toothpic to gently scrape inside the port. Do not use a paper clip, or any other metal obeject! I had the same issue with a two year old iphone 6 and retreived enough lint to knit a sweater.  It charges without interuption now.\n\nA: Plug in your phone. Open Activity Monitor app. Search for 'usbd'. Click Quit and then Force Quit.\n\nA: Ankit Chhajed's solution allowed me to find a workaround. This isn't really a solution since Apple still has a software bug, but you can do the following:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Stop iTunes (very important)\n\n*Find and kill the \"usbd\" process in process list (must not be running)\n\n*Attach iPhone\n\nA: I have the same problem with an iPhone XS and two different Macs, and no luck with any of the solutions that worked for other people.\nI finally figured out a workaround today:\nIt works as long as I connect it to a USB hub that's connected to my Mac. (Yes, I'm serious. It doesn't even have to be an active hub, I'm simply using a $10 passive one, and iTunes and Xcode work like a charm.)\nWhat also works is booting my Mac into Windows (via boot camp), then connecting it. Worth it if you simply want to back it up to iTunes and take it to the Genius bar.\n\nA: Force quitting the process usbd made this bug finally go away on my 2017 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Your computer is not giving it enough power\n\nA: I have found a solution to this problem (I was also struggling with this for a while). It's basically because the macbook is trying to create a data connection with the iphone through the usb port. Here are some things that seems to work in my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a USB extender and then connecting the iphone to it.\n\n*Or Force quitting itunes and then plugging in the iphone.\n\n*Or Ejecting the iphone from the itunes.\n\n\nI have come to understand that it is not a problem due to the cable, nor due to a broken USB port (so stop changing that). Just stop the data connection process between the iphone and mac using the above 3 ways or any other way you find. Let me know if it works. \nThanks.\n\nA: This happened to me with iPhone 5c. The way I charged was under a stack of books (6 or so). We went to the Apple Store to see if we could get it fixed but they said that getting it fixed would cost more than the actual phone. So I ended up just getting a whole new phone. But if you don't want to do that then like I said you could charge it under a stack of book with one on the bottom \n\nA: I purchased a Lifeproof Fre Power case for iPhone 6s (Feb 2016).  You must use a micro USB cable to charge the case, not a Lightning cable.  I had the same problem as Aamir Ali.  Drove me nuts.\nBut you are right.  Use a powerful charger and the \"ON/OFF\" charging problem goes away.  Same cable at home didn't work with cigar lighter charger in truck/auto, even though it is a 5.4 Amp Belkin model.  Or so they state.\nWhen powered through top-quality and high amp chargers the problem goes away.  The cable type or model does not seem to matter.  Only the power source.\nLifeproof has been \"nice\", but has no good technical answer for this problem.  \"You must use our cable and charger.\"  Hmm.\n", "Q: Can Mid 2015 Macbook Pro Run 3 External Monitors?

I've the same model and I've tested all the possible combinations, also trying passive and active DVI connections. \n\nA: You can run 3 to 4 external monitors (4 or 5 including the main screen). This is done through USB. By default you can only have 2 external monitors including your native display. But there is a way to add more.\nHere is how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB to HDMI adapter (this serves as an external graphics card that pulls from your CPU).\n\n*Plug adapter into your USB port\n\n*Plug your HDMI into the adapter and connect to monitor.\nIt's that simple. You can also get adapters for display port, VGA, DVI.\n\n\nThis video demonstrates the steps above.\nhttps://youtu.be/w8gE-ckBwjE\n\nA: YES.  It can be done if your MBP has the extra graphics chip AND you use Displayport as one of the monitor inputs.  Click on \"About this Mac\"  \"System Report\" \"Graphics/Displays\" and look to see if it has 2 graphics chips one of them being \"AMD Radeon R9 M370X\"\nMy experimentation has taught me this:\n\n\n*\n\n*2012 MBPR with extra graphics chip can drive 2x TB-DVI + 1x HDMI\n\n*2015 MBPR with single integrated graphics can only drive 2x of any combination as poster indicates (it cannot drive the combination in #3 below)\n\n*2015 MBPR with extra graphics chip can NOT drive 2x TB-DVI + 1X HDMI but it CAN drive 1x TB-DVI + 1x TB-DisplayPort + 1x HDMI as one of the answers here indicates.\n\n\nI don't know what changed between 2012+extra graphics and 2015+extra graphics to require that one of the displays be using displayport input (vs DVI/HDMI/VGA).

Just seems safari can be picky with what website password gets saved. Like I can save my password for stackexchange but I can't do the same for macrumors.com.\nI've looked at Safari preferences and nothing stands out. Can you please help? Thanks\n\nA: In some cases it is the website itself telling the browser to not save the passwords. There are a number of ways a web programmer can implement this and a number of ways to get around it.\nI used to use a little JavaScript \"bookmarklet\" that tried to turn off any JavaScript on a website that told the browser to not save the password. It worked about a quarter of the time. Barely worth the trouble.\nMore recently I have moved to a 3rd party password manager (1Password) that will save the password for any website.\nEditing a preference file is chancy and annoyingly \"manual\" but possible (EG worth looking into if it is possible) depending on how geeky you want to get. And checking for preferences that say not to remember a password for a specific site in Keychain or Safari itself is worth checking on. But my bet is on a website telling your browser not to remember passwords.\n\nA: Look in the Safari Preferences on the Passwords tab, is macrumors.com there with something like “Never remember password”?  If so, you can remove that entry and try again.  You might also like to search for sites in Keychain Access.app as I think ‘never remember’ sites might get stored there as well?\n", "Q: Text Replacements synchronisation between iOS and OS X does not work properly Note: As pointed out by Andreas Fischlin this entire QA is using incorrect terminology.\nI have changed the main title to correctly reflect the discussion is about Text Replacements not Shortcuts. A shortcut is  Cmd ⌘   S  to save a document etc.\nRather than correct the terminology right the way through, I thought it easier to add this note.\n\nI use keyboard shortcuts on my iPhone a lot. For example, @g which results in @gmail.com, or addr for my home address. I have got multiple OS X and iOS systems. I believe shortcuts in sync via iCloud.\nOn OS X some of my shortcuts are quite annoying because typing @g always results in @gmail.com without giving me a suggestion first (like it does on iOS) (btw, it took me quite some effort to type this sentence as it was continuously extending @g ...)\nWhen I delete a keyboard shortcut on device A (OS X), just one day later, the removed shortcuts are back! Furthermore, created shortcuts on device B (iOS) appear on device A, but removed shortcuts from device B are not removed on device A.\nI do not understand the logic of syncing keyboard shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to disable automatically completing my shortcuts on OS X?\n\n*Should the shortcuts be in sync between OS X and iOS?\n\n*Why are removed shortcuts keep coming back?\n\n*How can I fix the synchronisation between shortcuts on my machines?\n\n\n\nOn OS X, I have 'Correct spelling automatically' disabled.\n\niOS gives the keyboard shortcut as a suggestion.\nOn iOS go to: Settings > General > Keyboard > Shortcuts\nOn OS X go to: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Text\n\nA: First, to answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts do sync between OS X and iOS. However, in my experience this has always been quite slow, with the Mac taking a long time to recognize keyboard shortcuts I added on the phone.\n\n*Turning the synchronization off would require disabling the syncing of documents and preferences, which would also disable quite a lot of things that should be synced, so this is not really an option.\n\n*It seems that shortcuts are stored in several locations on an iPhone. Some of these can be deleted (which is what happens when you delete a shortcut), but some of them can't. These not-really-deleted shortcuts then sync again to iCloud, causing your problems. There is an Apple Forum post detailing how to delete the shortcuts, that you might wanna try (on your own risk, though.)\n\n\nNow, for some fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could change your shortcuts. E.g. having a prefix like ;; in front of your shortcuts would make sure you only expand what you really want to. Also, it's not that much effort for typing. Similarly, I use l@g for expanding my email-address, which doesn't make any problems since I never type l@ anywhere else. This could be called a workaround, but as it seems it's the only option that should work reliably.\n\n*Using TextExpander you should be able to configure the sync more easily. However, I don't have any experience with it, and I'd recommend the first solution.\n\n\nA: The entire discussion is based on very confusing terminology. The term keyboard shortcut should be reserved to true shortcuts, e.g. Cmd-S for saving a document. What you discuss here, however, are not keyboard shortcuts but what Apple calls Text Replacements. The purpose is to replace some rather cryptic abbreviation to a wanted long text. This is also often referred to as expansion.\nUnder iOS these expanding text replacements are to be defined and edited here: \"General -> Keyboard -> Text Replacement\"\nUnder OS X, e.g. OS X 10.11.x (El Capitan) these text replacement are found here: \"Black Apple -> Systems Preferences... ->  Keyboard -> Text\" (note the nearby tab 'Shortcuts' serves NOT the purpose of expanding text replacements, but allows to manage the actual keyboard shortcuts such as aforementioned Cmd-S).\nOn my Systems the expanding text replacements do also all not sync properly. I am still trying to figure out some method to overcome that, but fear from all what I learned so far that text replacements are among one of the rather buggy syncing features, where hope of a solution seems futile (at least I would not hold my breath for Apple resolving this). Unfortunately syncing in general, the fashionable it currently is, is far from working robustly in all cases. I am speaking from experience with Dropbox, Sugarsync, mycloud etc. where Apple's iCloud software is not the least an exception. In my experience on Apple Systems only calendar entries and address book records sync fine since several years. Everything else experiences repeatedly hickups or even fails drastically sooner or later.\n\nA: Not a full answer, but a working method...\nif you use common phrases for text replacements, accept that you will get conflicts.\nUse something that would not naturally occur in your writing.\nmyeml would be a fair trigger for your email address, myaddy for your snail mail, etc.\nI find that I remember them better if they are normally a common word; that however would cause conflicts, so instead I prefix all my triggers with 'nc' [originally because I kept things like this on notecards & also because I know of no word that starts with nc, so it removes potential conflicts] so ncapple would generate the Apple symbol  etc.\nThe synchronisation issue is separate & as far as I'm aware is indeed a bug, albeit one that has remained consistent for many years.\nChanging a text replacement on the Mac will sync via iCloud to my iPhone. However, it will also trigger a re-sync back in the other direction & the sync is incorrectly [imo] merged rather than replaced, so you get old triggers syncing back to the Mac rather than being replaced by the new version you just made, leaving you with the .\nThe only solution to this I have found is to go immediately to your iDevice & delete the unwanted triggers before the sync occurs.\nSettings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.\nA nuisance, but a repeatable solution.\n", "Q: I cant get past my password since my mac only spells caps and starts up in safe mode In the morning two days ago, I spilled some water on my Macbook pro.

In iTunes, select your iPhone device and click on \"Restore iPhone\". Let the process finish and the phone restart. After the restart you can plug it out of your computer. Now should your iPhone be reseted to factory defaults.\nMethod 2:\nYou say that you can't connect it to your Wi-Fi network. Have you tried with forgetting the network? To forget the network: Go into the Settings application -> Wi-Fi -> Tap on the little \"i\" at the same row as the name (SSID) of your Wi-Fi network.\nNow you can try to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network again and see if it works better. If you are able to connect to the Wi-Fi network, then you can reset it via the Settings application.\n\nA: I had this problem with my iPhone 4s, but the problem was that my phone itself had problems connecting to WiFi in general.

I planned to use the Thunderbolt daisy-chain feature to add another non-Thunderbolt monitor (mini DP --> HDMI) as the second link of the chain. However, it doesn't work when plugged in, and LG support informed me the daisy chain will only work with a monitor of the same model (e.g. another 34UM95).\nAnyone know of a workaround for this? I thought a normal Thunderbolt chain could terminate with a non-Thunderbolt monitor.\n(For clarity, my setup: MBP 15\" Late 2013 -- Thunderbolt --Thunderbolt --> LG 34UM95 -- MiniDP -- HDMI --> LG E2360)\n\nA: It's doable, one simply must include a TB device between the two monitors.  \nComputer->TB Monitor->TB Device->Non-TB Monitor \nThe TB device can be any dock, drive, etc. that has TB-in and TB-out ports (2 x TB ports).\n\n\n*\n\n*The technical details have to do with the way TB carries and decodes display signals.  TB can carry 2 signals.  Essentially, each TB device can only decode 1 x display signal (there's more to it, and technically TB devices could decode 2 signals, it just ain't happenin' right now).  So your initial TB monitor can decode one for viewing on itself and pass the other along...but it isn't decoded.  You need a second TB device to decode that second signal.  If the second device is a TB display, then you're in-like-Flynn.  If not (like in your case), you need another TB device to decode the signal before it hits your non-TB monitor.\n\n\nA: I'm temporarily going blind in one eye, which makes things blurry, so I wanted a really big monitor. I bought a Wal-Mart Sceptre 43\" 4k TV, but when I plugged it into the last place on my Thunderbolt daisy chain I got a horrible color cast - very pink - and there was no way to adjust the color to make it acceptable. But when I plugged the DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter directly into my 17\" MBP (quad-core i7, single Thunderbolt port, 16GB DRAM, 1TB SSD, 1GB VRAM, Thunderbolt Display) , the problem went away, so I knew it wasn't the TV. There had never been a problem with my HP 1080p DisplayPort monitor that worked perfectly for years on the end of the same Thunderbolt chain.\nMy solution: I finally remembered that one of my Thunderbolt docks had HDMI output. Plugged the TV cable into one of them and - drum roll! - problem solved! I have a CalDigit dock, but I'd guess that any Thunderbolt dock with HDMI would have fixed the problem. Note that not all docks support HDMI.\nMy setup: 17\" MBP > Thunderbolt Display > AKiTIO Thunder Dock > CalDigit Thunderbolt Station 2 > Promise Pegasus 4. \nNow I'm wondering if I can have a 3rd monitor by putting the HP back on the end of the chain?

If you enter a view, the Mail application will remember which one you used and will open with that one when you launch it next time.\n", "Q: Can't enter username in form with Silverlight I have had to install MS Silverlight in order to carry out online marking of examination answers on platform 'RM Assessor'\nThe RM Assessor login page appears, with a username window and a password window.

My broken iPhone was backed up... I've done it before but i forgot the steps. \n\nA: Assuming that you have an iCloud backup since you tagged your question with the \"iCloud\" tag.\nIf your old iPhone was backed up via iCloud then you just start the Setup Guide (the thing you see when you first start up an new iPhone) and go through some basics like language and connecting it to your Wi-Fi network. After that you will be asked if you want to set up the phone as A new iPhone, From an iTunes backup or From an iCloud backup. Choose iCloud backup. In the following step you will need to enter your Apple-ID login credentials. After that your iPhone will start downloading the data and it will take care of everything by itself.\nThe Setup Guide is easy to follow. Just read carefully and follow the instructions.\n\nA: You have to restore your new iPhone so you can get the \"Restore to iCloud BackUp\" option, otherwhise you only will get your basic info (Contacts, Notes, App Documnets and Streaming Photos, and all of this if you had them enabled).\nSo if you want to get the BACKUP into the new phone, restore it first and then you can do this, if you only want data sign in with your iCloud Backup in Settings App.\nYou may want to take a look into this documentation: https://support.apple.com/kb/ph12521\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Imessage / apple ID My wife and my children have iphones under her apple ID , I have an android Galaxy Note 3 ... today my wife sent a couple inappropriate texts to me and I responded ... later today one of my children told my wife that they were getting her texts .. would they have gotten mine from an Android or just the texts of other imessage users ? \n\nA: Sharing the appleId is the issue.  \nThe only way to solve the problem is to at the very least put the phones on different appleId's for iMessage.\nIf you open the Settings app, you will discover that iCloud, iTunes and App Store, Messages(iMessage), Facetime, Game Center, and perhaps Mail, Contact and Calenders all can be configured to use separate appleId's.   The simplist thing to do is use the same appleId for all, but there can be reasons for mixing.\nAppleId's aren't meant to be shared between people, it's really better if you give each user there own, even the kids. Family sharing can be used to unify purchases across all.   Family Sharing and Parental controls are the topics you should learn about next.  \n", "Q: Wrong contact synchronisation with 2 iPhones I bought an iPhone 6 and I gave my old iPhone (the 5c) to my niece. Had it done at the AT&T store. The sales rep changed her # to my old phone and my old # to my new phone. I jumped on the iCloud and was able to transfer all photos, messages, etc onto my new iPhone.\nThe first time my niece plugs in her iPhone 5c (which was my old iPhone), all of a sudden, all of her contacts replace mine on my iPhone 6 and now we both have the same contacts - hers.\nI logged into the iCloud on my laptop and all that's there is her contacts. Mine aren't there. Did I lose all my contacts? Is there any way I can get them back?\nAll my text messages are still on my new phone, but the vast majority of them only list a phone # not a name. So maybe I can figure out (in most cases) who these texts were with but it's still a major chore to re-enter everyone's name - not to mention other things I kept in my contacts for my friends such as email address and street address (all of which I will have to ask for or remember).\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: You can try to see if your phone had saved a backup to your computer upon last sync. This would mean restoring the phone from backup, which isn't always ideal depending on the situation.\nUnfortunately, it's not easy because iCloud was likely left enabled on the old phone, which synced them up to the cloud, and then down to your phone.\nElse, here is a suggestion provided from the Apple discussion forums:\n(BEFORE YOU BEGIN, MAKE SURE YOUR ICLOUD ACCOUNT IS SIGNED OUT OF THE OTHER PHONE!!!!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the device is connected to your local network.\n\n*Start the restore from iCloud back up.\n\n*Allow the devices settings to restore (watch for the confirmation of completion).\n\n*As the apps begin to restore pull the connection to your router WAN port (the one that goes to the telephone point/cable modem).\n\n*Wait for the time out confirmation.\n\n*Navigate to settings > iCloud and turn off contact syncing (keep contacts when prompted).\n\n*Reconnect the router to the internet and let the restore process complete.\n\n*Delete any iCloud contacts from iCloud.com on a computer.\n\n*Navigate to settings > iCloud and turn on contact syncing (merge contacts when prompted).\n\n", "Q: Recovering data from factory-reset iPad I updated my iPad to iOS 8.3 and something or other failed, leading to a factory reset. I'd like to recover my files.\nI found a couple Windows tools that apparently can do that, but either they can't install on the only Windows computer I have available at work (no admin privileges) or they're free trials that don't actually recover the files, just show that it can but want you to pay. \nI have not found anything promising so far, besides using PhotoRec per this link: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Recover_data_from_an_iPhone, which requires the iDevice to be jailbroken, which mine cannot be since it's 8.3 plus I want to keep overwriting to a minimum.\nI'm running TahrPup, which is a Puppy \"built from ubuntu 14.04 LTS trusty tahr packages\" and can install from ubuntu's repositories/etc.\n\nA: Number one, the more you use your iPad, the more chance that your missing data that might be recoverable will become overwritten so I have to mention that... it sounds like you already know.\nWhich generation of iPad is this? If it is an iPad 1, it should mostly be recoverable (either by a data recovery firm, or maybe some do-it-yourself recovery software such as Dr. Fone).\nHowever, since you mention iOS 8.3, it must be a later generation iPad. Unfortunately for your situation, these are all hardware encrypted by default (whether or not you set a passcode), and once factory reset, to my knowledge it's impossible to decrypt the old data. Encryption like this is a security feature, but it also can kill the chances of data recovery like in your situation.\nYour best bet would be to work from a backup of course (iTunes or iCloud), but I guess you don't have that option. I have heard that 3rd party app data (but not data from native apps) might be recoverable somehow but I'll have to check on that.\nI know this isn't the answer you're looking for and I really hope you can scrounge up a backup from somewhere. We are seeing the always-on encryption of some devices now becoming a major problem for data recovery. It's better for security, but that necessarily also severely reduces chances for people to recover their lost data. We have seen some manufacturers backstep a little on this recently, but it seems like the overall trend is for more encryption.\nYou can still send this to a professional data recovery firm that can work on mobile devices as a last ditch effort, and if there is any chance, maybe if something slightly different from what we're discussing occurred, then they would have the best chance at recovering it. Most do not charge if they cannot recover the needed data.\n", "Q: How can I upload Camera app photos to iCloud? On an iPad Air 2, is there a way to upload videos that I took with the iPad's Camera app to the iCloud?\n\nA: Apple says:\nOn your iOS 8 device\nIn the Photos app, tap Shared at the bottom of the screen, then tap Sharing at the top of the screen.\n\nTap the shared album you want to add to, then tap the Add button .\n\nFind photos or videos to add.\n\nFor example, tap Photos, Shared, or Albums to find photos.\n\nTap the photos and videos you want to add, then tap Done.\n\nsource: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12070?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Sufficient ssd for Mac This is my first query , and also my first apple product, macbook pro retina.\nShould I be buying 128 or 256 as I am really tight on budget.\nI have 2 tb of external but I dont know I could make use of it.\nI do some programming on Java and c and also python.\nThanks in advance \n\nA: 128Gb is plenty, with the condition it it is only plenty if you do not have much media (pictures, music, video). I have set up plenty of company laptops with 128Gb SSD drives, none are in any danger of running out of space.\nIf you have media, and can offload it to an external drive , then you are still fine. iTunes and Photos both allow the media library to go anywhere you want.\n", "Q: How to make Safari warn me with a pop-up window before closing a tab? Whether it is Chrome, Firefox or Safari, I always encounter this problem. I stream this video and let it loads for like 30 minutes so I can watch. Meanwhile, I navigate through my 10 other tabs. At some point I want to check how's the progress on the streaming video download. But all of a sudden, I accidentally click on the little cross that's hidden to close on the video tab and al the download is lost!\nI'm using Safari, so I need a fix for this browser, maybe Chrome too. I noticed that if I'm on Safari and the page is a form and I accidentally close the tab, it warns me if I'm sure I want to close the tab. I wish it could do the same for any tab.\nDoes anyone know a trick or extension that would help?\n\nA: Instead of using your mouse you can use the keyboard to cycle through the tabs. The keys Ctrl+Tab will go forward through your ten tabs and Ctrl+Shift+Tab will go backward. At no time will these key commands close a tab by mistake.\nShould you want to close a tab however you can achieve this with Command+W. Once you've finished using your browser you can close it with Command+Q.\nEdit: Further to my answer in the latest version of Safari you have the ability to pin tabs. Once a tab is pinned the only way to close it is to right click it with the mouse and select \"close tab\" Even the Command + W keyboard combination won't close it. \n\nA: In Firefox, you could use the Pinned Tab feature.\n\nPinned Tabs allow you to always keep your favorite web apps like\n  Facebook, Gmail and Twitter open and just a click away. Pinned Tabs\n  are small, can't be closed accidentally and open automatically when\n  you start Firefox.\n\nTo create a pinned tab just \"ctrl click\" on it and select pin tab. Now you can not accidentally close it.\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pinned-tabs-keep-favorite-websites-open\nIn Safari you would use the Top Sites feature displaying thumbnail images of the web sites you visit most often. There you can Pin a Tab.\n\n", "Q: Using ethernet for iMac and Wi-Fi for other devices I now use Wi-Fi for my iMac and for various other devices. Can I set up the iMac to use ethernet directly w/o Wi-Fi involvement and have the Wi-Fi continue to connect for iPads, TV and smart phones? Concerned about security as I do banking and other financial stuff only on the iMac.\n\nA: Usually it's no problem to use the ethernet interface instead of the Wi-Fi interface, if the router/access point contains one or several ethernet connectors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an ethernet cable between your iMac and the router. Depending on your router you might have to enable/configure its ethernet interfaces.\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Network.\nConfigure IPv4 of the ethernet interface by choosing DHCP or Manually. If you've chosen \"Manually\" enter an appropriate IPv4 address, netmask, gateway and DNS-server\n\n*Click on the gear in the lower left corner -> Set Service Order..., drag the ethernet interface to the top of the list and click OK.\n\n*Optionally you may deactivate Wi-Fi by highlighting it in the left pane and then \"Turn Wi-Fi off\"\n\n*Then hit Apply\n", "Q: Cleaning my Macbook Air I just used some Rubbing Alcohol (I didn't use too much and I put the stuff on a paper towel first) to wipe and clean the keyboard and backside of said keyboard of my Macbook Air. Now I'm obessively terrified at the thought that I may have just made a costly mistake. I want to say that nothing appears to be happening yet, but I don't want to jinx it. Should I not have done it????!!!!!\n\nA: It’s difficult to answer your question as the answer is, to some extent, opinion-based.\nIn their support document, Apple used to explicitly discourage consumers: (source)\n\nDon’t use window cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or abrasives\n\nHowever, it appears that Apple has since changed the wording, eliminating the »alcohol« part:\n\nDon't use aerosol sprays, solvents, abrasives, or cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide that might damage the finish.\n\nIn a related support document, Apple suggests to use disinfectant wipes as long as they don’t contain bleach:\n(Note: I’m not allowed to post more than two links as I’m a new user. However, just google for HT201294 and the document will turn up.)\n\nUse a disinfectant wipe to wipe the area first, then use a damp, soft, lint-free cloth, and finally dry the area with another soft, lint-free cloth.\nDo not use disinfectant wipes containing bleach or disinfectant sprays in general.\n\nThis suggests that Apple has stopped discouraging customers from using rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol. Note that rubbing alcohol seems to be an active ingredient in the disinfectant wipes recommended by Apple.\nApple suggests a few brands of disinfectant wipes (Lysol wipes or Clorox Kitchen Disinfecting wipes). Ultimately, it is up to you to choose a product that works best for you.\n", "Q: My old iTunes library isn't appearing in iTunes on my new PC I recently set up my new PC (Windows 8) and installed iTunes.

It says this disk is locked (the one I just wiped). \nNow I can not even unmount it again. \nI tried in the Terminal to erase it, won't work either. \nAnyone else having these issues, or has any clue how I can solve the problem (install Yosemite)?\n\nA: If you're looking for a Terminal solution, you can try this:\ndiskutil eraseVolume free %noformat% disk0s2\n\nor \ndiskutil eraseDisk free %noformat% GPT disk0\n\nIn this case, disk0 should be changed to match whatever your actual device node is. It will depend on whether you're using a USB stick to boot into recovery – in which case it's probably disk1 – or if you're actually booting off of the disk you're trying to erase.\nAnd an important disclaimer: If you blow away your disk, you will not be able to boot into the onboard recovery mode. In fact, you probably aren't going to be able to do this without booting off of USB. I hope you have a recovery stick somewhere, or another computer from which you can make one.\nIt should go without saying that you will lose data if you run either one of these commands successfully.\n\nA: I was able to solve this by using a usb stick of yosemite. \nAppsrently the disk was not locked when I booted from it. \nThis is only a 10.11 issue.  \nThanks for your replies. \n", "Q: iPhone restore and recovery My iPhone wouldn't accept my passcode, so I looked online, and it said to put the phone into recovery mode, then sync it to a computer with iTunes.

One is Mavericks (10.9.5) and this one is Yosemite. On Mavericks, this works flawlessly. With wine, Steam launches fine. However, there is a peculiar window showing up, and whenever I try launching a game/app, it pops the usual window with \"Preparing to launch...\", then it disappears and nothing happens.\n\nThe image on top shows the unusual window showing up next to the main window.\n\nThis is my setup in Wineskin of Steam (needs -no-dwrite because else, it shows blank buttons).\nHere and here are the 2 Last Run log files.\nUPDATE:\nReinstalling didn't help, and I figured out what the little window is. On Mavericks, it was on the navbar on top, and on yosemite, it is in this window. Clicking it shows the same options as the Steam icon on the navbar on Mavericks. Also, I may have found something related in the logs:\nerr:winediag:SECUR32_initNTLMSP ntlm_auth was not found or is outdated. \nMakesure that ntlm_auth >= 3.0.25 is in your path. Usually, you can find it in the winbind package of your distribution.\n\n\nI am using OS X Yosemite (10.10.3)\n\nA: The difference may be related to whether you're using the Mac driver. Go to Set Screen Options, and check Use Mac Driver instead of X11. It's the top checkbox under \"Other Options\". \nOtherwise, it's not clear how your installations are different. Because you're using Wineskin, however, you have a great alternative: Just copy the Wineskin app from your working computer to this one.

I've tried to find help in a lot of websites, but my iPod is still not letting me text non-Apple users.\n\nA: The iPod can only send iMessages, not SMS. iMessage is a service from Apple that only work on Apple devices. It is possible to send regular SMS from an iPod if you have an iPhone on the same Apple-ID and on the same Wi-Fi network. If you do not have an iPhone all messages is sent from your e-mail address not a phone number.\n\nA: In order to be able to send a traditional text message, you need access to a mobile phone network (and a way of \"paying\" for the message-usually part of your PAYG sim contract etc). An iPad or iPod touch can send iMessages but will not be able to send a text unless it is linked to an iPhone with a valid mobile sim.\n\nA: While the other answers are basically correct, you can use a third party app. \nTry Google Hangouts/Google Voice (your Google Voice phone Number is associated with your hangouts identity) or Pinger, as well as others (search the App Store for \"SMS\" or \"texting app\").  \nThese apps will assign a phone number so that you can send and receive SMS messages. \n\nA: Good news, Yes you can send normal Text messages on your ipod touch.

When I use OS X on my Mac Mini and it is going to sleep it wakes up automatically when receiving any packets (e.g. when I try to connect via SSH).\nNow I'm using Debian Jessie on my Mac mini and when I run ethtool -i eth0 I get\nSupports Wake-on: g\nWake-on: g\n\nWhich means only magic packet activity supported by card.\nSo are there any Linux drivers to wake up my Mac on receiving SSH access requests for example?\n\nA: The Mac registers with a Bonjour Sleep Proxy when it goes to sleep. The Bonjour Sleep Proxy (BSP) can be an AppleTV, Apple router, or built into the ethernet stacks of recent Macs. The BSP will pretend to be the Mac and continue to advertise services. If another machine tries to connect to one of those advertised services, the BSP will send the magic packet to wake the Mac up.\nOne service which receives special attention is ssh, so if you attempt to ssh to a Mac which is asleep but registered with a BSP, the BSP will wake up the Mac.\nIn order to have this work on Linux, you would need a program on Linux that can register the linux box with the BSP when it goes to sleep. It looks like SleepProxyClient will do that:\n\nThese scripts enables your Non-Apple server (or NAS) to save energy by\n  going to sleep if it's currently not in use. But it will be instantly\n  woken up again by the SleepProxyServer using Wake on Lan (WOL) if one\n  of it's services is requested. See\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Sleep_Proxy for more details.\n\n\nA: My understanding from the Debian wiki:\nQuote:\n\nI found that I didn't want any of the Wake On LAN settings except Wake on \"Magic Packet\" (g). I only wanted my machine to turn on when I specifically told it to, not on unicast messages (u), broadcast messages (b) or multicast messages (m). \n\nInstead of Wake on \"Magic Packet\" (g), you would want Wake on unicast messages (u).\nDisclaimer: I haven't tried it.\n", "Q: iPhone screen zoomed without zoom accessibility feature My iPhone 6 screen is awkwardly zoomed in (not on the zoom screen function) and I can't access the edges of my screen.

Any tips?\n\nA: Why do you say \"without the zoom accessibility feature\"? That's almost certainly what has happened; that feature has been activated. Try 3-finger tapping to unzoom your phone.\n\nA: Connect your device to iTunes and you can disable all accessibility features from the connected computer. The other answer is great for disabling the features from the iOS device which is easier for most people unless the zoom factor is too large to work the device.\n", "Q: Install OS X Cheetah on my Macbook Air with OS X Yosemite How can I install Cheetah (OSX 10.0) on my 2014 Macbook? Can I use virtual box? Where can I find iso files to install? BTW my macbook is running Yosemite\n\nA: You will need to virtualize the hardware. PearPC claims to successfully run Mac OS X 10.3, so my best assumption is that it would also run 10.0.\nThe matter of obtaining and running the OS on your computer is of dubious legal nature, depending on where you live and what licenses you accepted when you purchased and ran the OS.\n\nA: Any ISO file is likely pirated. Best to buy a CD on the used market or find a local computer group that has a library. If you wanted to be totally legal, buy a used Mac that came with that OS.  Replacement media is often available from Apple even long after they stop selling a certain OS.\nI can't speak to virtual box other than it's taking more fiddling then I cared to spend.

I’ve googled a lot and gave up to find a working solution.\nI need this to run specific software for my old but mighty film scanner.\n\nA: You will not be able to install OS X Tiger on a modern Mac due to lack of hardware driver support.\nApple's license agreement for OS X did not allow virtualization at all until Snow Leopard Server and Lion, so virtualization software such as VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion, and Parallels Desktop do not support running Tiger in a Virtual Machine.\nIf you need to run Tiger, your best bet is purchasing an older Intel Mac that shipped with Tiger or a PowerPC Mac that supports Tiger.\n", "Q: Can I make my own kernel extensions on El Capitan? I have recently heard that a feature called rootless that is going to be on El Capitan. This means that folders such as /System cannot be modified by the root user and only signed kext (kernel extensions) can be installed on the computer.\nI have not thought about it before but now I have I would like to make my own kext extensions. The only issue is I am not a paid developer so therefor I cannot sign my kext extensions.\nWhen I upgrade to El Capitan would I be able to make by own kexts and install them on my system while still being able to boot my computer and not having to join the $99/Year Apple Developers Program?\n\nA: Rootless can be completely disabled on OS X El Capitan (though not on iOS, for hopefully obvious reasons). Therefore if you don't mind foregoing the ostensible benefits it provides, you can essentially revert to Yosemite's security model - which is to say, unsigned kexts can be used, but it requires preparation to do so.\nIt may not be able to be disabled in future versions of the OS, but for now it can be turned off.\n\nA: Reboot your machine in recovery mode :\nhold cmd+r\nThen launch the terminal and deactivate the System Integrity Protection status by entering the following command line :\n$ csrutil disable\n\nThis is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.\nBut your unsigned kext will load\n\nA: Your computer will always be able to boot with or without unsigned kexts (well, that is, assuming they don't provide some boot critical function like a SATA driver for your boot disk). Whether your computer will still be useful after booting without an unsigned kext of course depends on the nature of the extension.\nAt WWDC 2013, there was a presentation about kext development that was very explicit: signing is supported and unchecked in 10.8, checked but not enforced in 10.9, and mandatory \"in the future\".\nSigning requires a developer identity, and a developer identity requires an active Apple Developer Program membership.\nSo in answer to your question: No, you will not be able to develop and load kexts on upcoming versions of OS X without being an ADP member.\nApple has a section on their developer website dedicated to code signing topics.\n", "Q: Problem transferring files from old 2008 iMac to new 2015 iMac using Migration assistant Transferring files from old 2008 iMac to new 2015 iMac using Migration assistant and ethernet cable - work fine, albeit 3 hours, until says \" About 12 minutes remaining\" on the new iMac and About 16 minutes remaining on old iMac, seems to have frozen for last 2.5 hours, ideas?\n\nA: Failed hard drive?

For instance, I like reading Quora. They regularly send me digests to my email. What I do is I click the link from the email that opens the digest in Safari tab. I usually prefer to leave those open tabs until later on (usually Sunday) when I go through many tabs at once and read through them all.\nWell, this works really well on Chrome browser on my Windows desktop but on my iPad, when I open Safari (say after a week or so) it reloads the page instead of showing what was opened there originally (a week ago.) This results in the old digest being completely reloaded with some new stuff.\nIs there any way to make Safari on my iPad stop reloading pages and just keep what was shown there originally? It is very annoying!\n\nA: Probably not.  You need to think of the nature of the iPad.\nIt is RAM constrained (and battery constrained, but that probably doesn't affect this as much as RAM), so it often suspends apps so they can be \"reconstituted\".\nDepending on what you do in the week (a long time in app land) the pages would be suspended and removed from memory.  Reopen the browser (and this would be any browser on the iPad, not just Safari) it has to get the pages again to show.\nSo.. this is what iPads (and to some extent android devices) do.  It remembers where you were and re-gets the page.  Now you could do a Reading List, or even use Pocket (I think Pocket takes a snapshot in time, so may work better).  Those may bring you closer to where you want to be.  But the tabs will be reloaded, because they were gone way before you re-opened safari\n\nA: I guess these links are generic ones, for example a generic link to a start page or a category or such.

Is there a way to have Calendar.app display its week numbers using the standard ISO 8061 week definition? \nThe standard says a week starts on Monday, and the first Thursday of the year defines the first week. So at the end of 2015, the standard week of 2015-12-28 to 2016-01-03 is Week 53. In contrast, Calendar.app in Yosemite & Mountain Lion shows Week 1.\nI'm wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*What definition of week is Apple using? Perhaps simply the First of January is always Week 1?\n\n*Is there any way to change this default behavior to show standard weeks?\n\n\nA: Calendar System\nSystem Preferences in Yosemite 10.10.5 (and all later OS X releases, through El Capitan 10.11.3)  lets you change the calendar system used across apps. The default for a United States install is Gregorian. To get behavior compliant with the ISO 8601 standard, change to ISO 8601. \nChoose System Preferences > Language & Region > Calendar (popup menu) > ISO 8601.\n\nBelow are screen shots of Apple’s Calendar.app, before and after switching between Gregorian calendar and ISO 8601 calendar. I added the \"Gregorian\"/\"ISO\" labels. \nNote the week numbers shown on the left. Weeks 52 & 1 changed to weeks 52 & 53. In a standard week, January 1st of 2016 is in Week 53. In ISO 8601 notation for weeks, that would be the week 2015-W53, and January 1st 2016 would be 2015-W53-5 with the weekday number appended. \nFor more info, see an entire Wikipedia article dedicated to ISO week date.\n\n\nCAVEAT I do not know the ramifications of changing your Mac calendar system from Gregorian to ISO 8601. I searched support.apple.com but found no documentation.\n\nA: Apple use the standard calendar \"Gregorian calendar\".\nIn contrast the:\nISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has 52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 or 366 days. The extra week is referred to here as a leap week, although ISO 8601 does not use this term. Weeks start with Monday. The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year (and, hence, always contains 4 January). ISO week year numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days close to 1 January.\nAnyway, if you want ISO week number use this link to install it. \n\n", "Q: How do I display text in the middle of a dialog as well as a new line?

It was to find the logical volume id though the \n\ndiskutil cs list\n\nthen to use \n\ndiskutil cs revert\n\nHowever, In disk utility my main disk (the one at the top) has been renamed to the name of the SSD hardware with my two partitions underneath, rather than just 'Macintosh HD' with the two partitions.\n\nSo I was wondering, what does this command do, are there any effects of it changing the name in disk utility and are there any consequences of this command?\nThanks in advance!\n--\nMacBook Pro 13\" Late 2013 Retina 2.4Ghz Intel Core i5 256GB SSD OS X Yosemite 10.10.3\n\nA: diskutil cs revert turns off the Core Storage volume manager for that volume. The Yosemite installer turns it on in case it's needed later (mostly for FileVault), but if you don't actually need it (e.g. for FileVault a Fusion disk) it doesn't do anything useful.\nIf you aren't using FileVault or a Fusion disk, what Core Storage mostly does is confuse Disk Utility, limiting its ability to dynamically resize and rearrange volumes, and preventing it from displaying the disk structure properly. That \"251 GB APPLE SSD SD...\" thing is what Disk Utility should be displaying there, because \"Macintosh HD\" and \"BOOTCAMP\" are both volumes within the physical SSD. With Core Storage, it was showing BOOTCAMP as somehow part of Macintosh HD, which it isn't at all.\n", "Q: How can I turn off Bluetooth with only keyboard actions? A trackpad in another room was interfering with my ability to use my laptop's native trackpad, such that I could not click on anything. I wanted to either turn off bluetooth or disconnect the offending device. \nI used Finder to get into Bluetooth settings but then I was stuck. I could not figure out a keyboard shortcut to get to the button to turn off bluetooth nor to disconnect the connected trackpad. \n\n\nA: If you have a TouchBar Mac Book:\nInvoke Siri via TouchBar and simply say \"Turn Off Bluetooth\"\nIf Siri is not enabled, it will prompt you to enable first.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206993\nFirst time used Siri on my Mac!\n\nA: Go into the Finder, type command + shift + u and open Script Editor by selecting it and typing command + o.

The trackpad should now be disconnected.\n\nA: Another way would be to enable VoiceOver (CMD + F5) and using this to keyboard navigate the bluetooth settings panel with TAB and ENTER plus the arrow keys.\nThat let's you both turn off bluetooth and disconnect specific devices.\n\nA: If it is just the primary click function you are missing and you still have control of where you move the mouse you likely also have the function to right click. \nTherefore, if you can bring up Bluetooth settings with your keyboard using spotlight search, you can then right click on the device you need to disconnect. \nNo script necessary! \nI just did it. \n\nA: This works in BigSur 11.2.3:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Check Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\nThen, in future:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd <Space> to open Spotlight Search\n\n*Type bluetooth and select the Bluetooth settings app\n\n*Press the tab key to move focus to the Turn Bluetooth On or Turn Bluetooth Off button\n\n*Press space to activate the button\n\n", "Q: Why iOS settings and iTunes report the storage usage differently? My iTunes shows me that there is about 7 GB of free space, while iOS settings shows me that there is only about 80 MB of available space.  How do free space and available space differ?\n\n\nAdditional note: I tried to sum all used sizes of apps in Manage Storage list; its total (about 2925 MB) does not match to iOS settings’ Used size report (11.7 GB), but match to iTunes’ storage usage chart.\n\nA: I have a 4 GB disparity between what shows on my iPhone 6 64 GB and what shows up in iTunes.\nI propose that this is because of the iOS Operating System itself. While the phone is able to calculate the exact size of the OS and thus give a more accurate reading, iTunes doesn't have access to that data and assumes your phone just has that much more space.\nHere's what you need to do -\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're jailbroken, those additional files are definitely taking 'hidden' space that's not being accounted for. Think about removing the jailbreak.\n\n*If you're using an older iOS version, upgrade. The newer versions (8.1.3 and 8.3) take up less space.\n\n*Since you're connected to your iTunes anyways, try doing this - simply load up 1-2 GB of files from your computer to your phone (music/videos/random doc files). This will force your phone to acknowledge the space it actually has.\n\n\nThe last one, of course, is just for science.\n\nA: I just had this same issue, with a 3GB discrepancy between what iTunes and my iPhone were showing as free space. After looking through \"Manage Storage\" I realized that iTunes doesn't see the space taken up by downloading music for offline listening through apps like Spotify, but your iPhone does. The numbers matched almost perfectly.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I've had this issue multiple times.  My podcast app would show it is using 500MB of space but there were no saved podcasts.  Same deal with several other apps.  I had No photos on my phone nor did I have any music.  Still, I only showed an available 600MB of space available on my phone.  \nAfter doing several hard restarts computer reboots and syncs, the only way to solve the problem is to restore the iphone.  This gave me 4GB of free space and seemed to reset the memory allocation on most of my app discrepancies such as the podcast app.  \nI don't know what causes this but it is quite frustrating.\n\nA: After having done some research, I come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is caused by\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes counting the space required for apps and data, deducing the free storage from the total\n\n*the iPhone reporting the actually free space\n\n\nThe difference is that the iPhone obviously used additional space for caching purposes, but that space is not recognized by iTunes (maybe on purpose). The space can be regained by one of the measurements mentioned in the other answers (backup/restore etc.), because these delete the cache data.\nHowever, the iPhone will start building up new caches, so these solutions are not lasting. Also, if you free the cache, then use the freed space to copy more apps and data to the device, your iPhone will eventually not be able to use as much cache as it actually would, possibly leading to lower over-all performance.\nAs a consequence, I would not recommend to force your iPhone to free the cache space unless absolutely necessary.\n\nA: An iOS application can mark data as \"temporary\", which means the data can be deleted when necessary. For example, if you download a podcast that you could download again at any time, the podcast app probably marks it as \"temporary\". Same with apps like Spotify; you don't actually lose anything if downloaded data is removed. \nI think iTunes doesn't count that data because it's interested in how much you can copy to your phone (if there are 7GB that can be removed, then you can copy 7GB to the phone), but the phone reports the space as used, because it is actually used.\nSo the difference is data that is there, but that iOS is allowed to delete at any time. \n\nA: I reset my iPhone and recover the backup data.  My all installed apps and data are seemingly maintained well, but its storage usage became changed: about 7 GB of new free space came out.  Also, it’s reported in the same way by both iTunes and iOS settings.\nI’m still not aware of the cause, but my problem was anyway solved.\n\nA: I was able to free a ton of space by backing up my phone, performing a full reset (\"Erase All Content and Settings\"), and restoring the backup. This shrunk the discrepancy, but didn't completely eliminate it.\n\nA: I've tried the last suggestion and it seems to work only temporarily.  I, personally, currently have a 5GB discrepancy on my iPhone 5s (16GB) vs. the available memory shown in iTunes.  I went to an Apple Store today for some technical assistance and they couldn't help.  I'm hoping the new OS will alleviate the situation when it is released in a week.\nI store no music on my phone and stream through Apple Music. I have noticed that the phone will start to download songs that I think I am streaming and those have to be periodically deleted when I discover that they're actually taking up valuable memory.\n\nA: In this case, the OS has so little room, you can't trust it to accurately run.\nI would delete files and apps of the iOS device until you get 1 or 2 GB of free space and then power it down and check again.\nIf the two values differ widely after freeing up space, it's usually the equivalent to filesystem corruption and you'll want to consider backing up the phone and wiping it.\nAt that point, you can test and see that the storage works as you expect and then either set it up newly, or restore the backup you made.\n\nA: I had a similar issue but I was a bit hesitant to try restoring my phone from the backup (which is the solution that apparently helped most people).\nInstead, I ended up using \"Memory & Disk Scanner Pro\" app from the AppStore. It was able to reclaim 3 GBs of free space (without removing any of my data of course) and it took only a couple of minutes.\nTo be fair, it's a paid app (~1 EUR), and the interface is rather ugly, but it did its job well - so I found it worth the price.\n", "Q: Several Google Chrome Helper orphan processes Chrome keeps leaving GCH processes behind, even after stopping the main process.

I started internet recovery all fine, but when I went to reinstall OS X, there was no disk to install it to available.\nTherefore, I want to the Disk Utility to erase, and do a clean install, except there is only disk0, and as part of that, OS X Base system showing. Total size of these two disks is only 1.28 GB, yet my HD is 256 GB.\nFurther, all of the options to erase are greyed out for OS X base system, as though I'm not in recovery mode, except I am.\nHas my HD died, or do I have other options?\n\n\nA: Internet recovery loads from the internet and runs in RAM. Presumably you have more than 1.28GB of RAM. OS X Base System is the base system for recovery, not your internal drive. Based on that, it cannot see your internal drive at all. There's not much you can do if the computer itself can't see the drive. If there's any way you can get this into an Apple Store, that would probably be the easiest solution as I'm sure Apple's technicians could fix this in no time.\nOn the other hand, if you're comfortable with opening this up and checking for loose wires, then that would probably be my first step (emphasis on MY first step.

When I add my user account manually and give it Read/Write access to the 'Network Users' folder, it used to work (not anymore, I still get the same error now). When I set the home folder to 'Local', I can login and everything is fine.\nI also came to this conclusion with Apple Support.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n\nA: It might be something with the authentication process of the clients. Open Directory needs to be running on the server (try to delete and rebuild it) and this server must be assigned as a directory server in the the clients account preferences. You might be able to check permissions by accessing the a home folder via CMD-K and the AFP:// URL from the Finder of any client. If you get read/write access then permissions should be okay.\n", "Q: Is there a free VMWare Player for Mac? There is a free player for vmware on windows, is there a free version as well for mac?

I usually work on one, but would like to be able to quickly continue work on the other. That means the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open important apps that are in use (e.g. for develeopment)\n\n*open all iterms and set the correct path\n\n*open Chrome with all the tabs\n\n*copy files changes (in one way only) from main Mac to the other\n\n\nI do use BTSync for some of above, but still, would be like to be able to continue work in a better way.\n\nA: Although the solutions suggesting GIT or O/S X Server will work one way to keep two Macs in Sync is something like Dropbox. I know a few people who keep their entire home folder there.\nObviously usage of that much disk space in Dropbox will required a paid subscription but for the syncing files issue that should work a treat.\n\nA: I'm not quite sure if that's worth the efforts to install and manage such setup for your purpose: What you need is a server (e.g. \"OS X Server\" app on a dedicated Mac) and enable the \"Mobile home folders sync\" service. You then need to tell your workstation Macs to sync their local home folders to that server. As long as you don't use both Macs at the same moment, this should work well. Depending on your network, it may take some time for each sync - more or less \"quickly\".\n", "Q: Printer Drivers for old models of Samsung, Xerox or Dell printers ( like Samsung ML-1520) I've got a quite old Samsung printer, model ML-1520. I can not find any drivers for it. Samsung seems to have stopped supporting OS X, and Apple only offers drivers for models not older than ML-1630.\nI've tried to install the drivers by Apple and setup my printer as 1630 and other models, but it doesn't print.\nWhere can I find proper drivers?\n(I'm writing both Q&A. For the purpose of search optimization I've added extra vendors in the header. My solution is applicable to all those vendors).\n\nA: First to do: check if your printer is supported by Apple. It was not true in my case, but may be true in yours.\nThere are at least two opensource driver packages, supporting the printers which are abandoned by their vendors:\nSpliX.\n\na set of CUPS Printer drivers for SPL (Samsung Printer Language) printers. If you have a such printer, you need to download and use SpliX.\n\nSupported Printers\n\n*\n\n*Dell 1100, 1110\n\n*Samsung CLP-200, CLP-300, CLP-500, CLP-600, CLP-610, CLX-216X, CLX-2170, CLX-3160, ML-1510, ML-1520, ML-1610, ML-1630, ML-1710, ML-1740, ML-1750, ML-2010, ML-2150, ML-2250, ML-2510, ML-2550, ML-2571, ML-3050, ML-3560\n\n*Xerox Phaser 3115, 3116, 3117, 3120, 3121, 3122, 3130, 3150, 3420, 3425, 5500, 6100, 6110\n\nSamsung-GDI for Mac OS X\nSupported Printers\n\n*\n\n*Generic GDI Printer\n\n*Lexmark\n\n*Samsung ML-200, ML-210, ML-1000, ML-1010, ML-1020, ML-1200, ML-1210, ML-1220, ML-1410, ML-1430, ML-1440, ML-1510, ML-1520, ML-1610, ML-1710, ML-1740, ML-1750, ML-2010, ML-2150, ML-2250, ML-2550, ML-4500, ML-5080, ML-6040\n\nPersonal experience\nI first installed SpliX and it worked well with documents printed from MS Word or PDFs. But it failed with printing .jpg images from Preview app or command-line lpr utility. So I switched to Samsung-GDI, which handles .jpg well.\nAlso, if a printer is set up twice with different drivers it doesn't work with any of them. So you should only have one printer in Settings > Printers (per each device).

The noise is not heard with a headset. I noticed this after updating my software to the latest one.\n\nA: To isolate whether this is truly a hardware or software problem..\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app  \n\n*If it doesn't already show, select Audio Devices from the window menu\n\n*Select your Speaker output on the left Sidebar; the tab on the right should show Output highlighted & Input greyed out\n\n*Bottom right, select Configure Speakers…\n\n*In the new dialog that drops down you should see 'front left' & 'front right' each with a drop menu beneath.  The channels are likely just labelled 1 & 2.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Swap the channels - set left to 2 & right to 1.  \n\n*Test with some audio playback.\n\n\n\n\nIf the right speaker still crackles - it's a hardware problem.\nIf the left speaker is now the one affected - it's a software problem.\nAdd a comment if it's software & we can test further.\nIf it's hardware, it's a trip to the Apple shop, I'm afraid.\nLate Edit:\nBecause comments seem to be trying to break the laws of physics, let me explain further what is the most likely damage, & why it cannot be due to \"magnetisation\".\nSo, lets do a very quick 'physics 101' on the principles of loudspeakers.\nThe basic elements of a speaker are  \n\n\n*\n\n*a housing to keep all of the following in place.\n\n*a permanent magnet.  \n\n*a coil of electrical wire [usually copper] on a hollow cylinder, placed to intersect that magnet & free to move, within tolerance, inside the magnet.  \n\n*a cone of paper or plastic, fixed to the coil at one end & the housing at the other, used to project the sound from the coil into the room.  \n\n\nBy definition, a permanent magnet is... permanent. Break it & both halves are still magnets. grind it to powder & every particle will still display the same characteristics. They are, for the purposes of this explanation, immutable.\nAs alternating current is passed through a coil of wire, it induces a magnetic field in the coil - positive & negative depending on the current flow, first one way then the other. As every schoolboy knows, opposite magnetic poles attract & similar poles repel.\nThe result of this is that the coil is forced first in one direction then the other in relation to the permanent magnet.\nBy having the coil connected to a larger cone, this transfers the movement into air pressure waves... sound.\nThe copper coil can never be permanently magnetised, because that can only happen [broadly] to ferrous metals - those which contain iron.\nThe most common ways to break this finely-balanced setup are :- \n\n\n*\n\n*Stressing the join where the cone meets the housing - causing softening &/or eventual fracture at the join. This will make the speakers buzz at high volumes.\n\n*Overheating the coil until it permanently distorts. This will cause distortion at almost all volume levels.\nBoth of the above are usually caused by running the volume too loud for tolerance.\nOver-compressed audio [Google 'The Loudness War' for background] or sound applications designed to 'make it all louder' (Boom, I'm looking right at you:/ ) will contribute to early failure.\nA third, often overlooked cause is moisture. Paper cones & coil substrates don't like moisture.. whether it's just continuous high humidity or inelegantly-applied soda.\nThe tolerances between magnet & coil are measured in microns. Distort the coil or the cone & your speaker is as good as dead.\nWith an analog amplifier, running at low battery power would contribute by adding distortion to the signal at lower volumes. Computers don't really suffer from this, as their batteries are designed to give close to full output until recharge.\n\nA: Because you said it dosen't present on a headset I would check the speakers out prior to doing any sort of complex testing.  \nPlug your speakers into another source like an iPod/iPad, another Mac/PC or anything you can find with audio out.\nIf the symptoms still present, then the problem is your speakers.  \n", "Q: A particular picture copies by itself multiple times in camera roll every day I've been using iPhone for many years now but this is the first time I've this problem.  \nI received a picture from a friend, who is on Android.

I know this is true when I put them into another folder.\nHow do I force my Mac to upload my photos to iCloud?\nThis is not a duplicate of iCloud Photo Library - force upload since I have less then 250 photos so I am not exceeding the maximum limit.\n\nA: I know this seems a bit stupid. I think it was because I was a bit impatient. My upload speed is 0.71Mb/s (that means it will take 3 hours 43 minutes to upload!). It has only uploaded 170MB/1.1GB. I have however had my computer asleep for a few hours though.\nEven though I have posted this I would still like to know how to force upload incase I need to in the future.\n\nA: Assuming you're on OS X 10.10 (with Photos.app): make sure you've enabled the appropriate checkboxes under \"Options...\" on the Photos row.\n\n", "Q: I can't 'Screen Share' on my MBP with OS X Yosemite Specs:\nMacbook Pro Mid 2012\nOS X 10.10.4\nI'm not able to Share my screen with my friends.\nI want to connect with my friend's Macbook (which is not in my network, different city) for troubleshooting purposes, & so I tried Screen Sharing from Messages App:\n\nAfter I click 'Ask to share screen', it does send a request to the other Mac for permission, after he click on 'Allow', nothing happens!?\n[ The Screen Sharing option is turned ON & Remote Management is turned OFF, on my Mac as well as on my friend's Mac.]\n\nHow do I connect with his computer, & control it over internet,\nIt'll be very convenient for troubleshooting purposes.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are not connected on the same LAN segment (both computers on the same network) and you are going through a router, chances are the router's firewall is blocking the connection.\nWhat you have to do is open/forward the ports on the router Apple screenshare  (remote desktop) uses to communicate.  The ports are:\nTCP: 5900, 5988\nUDP: 5900, 3283\n\nScreen sharing behind a firewall-- What ports? \nOne thing that I personally like to do is test out on the same LAN segment first (behind the router firewall).  This way I know that my machine is fully functioning and the service is working properly.  This way, when trying to troubleshoot a connection issue across the router, the changes of it being my machine is greatly reduced.\nYou will need to edit your REMOTE router to allow incoming connections of the ports that I mentioned.  You do this by:\n1)  Find out what IP address the computer is using\n2)  Go into the router admin page via web browser (it will the the \"router\" address in your network settings.  You will need the username and password.\n3)  Under Firewall, you may see an option to forward different ports.  Create entries for the ports listed above.  In each entry you should have a \"source\" and a \"destination.\"  In source, leave blank for \"all\" and for destination, enter the IP address you got in step one.  This will forward all traffic from these ports to the computer.\n4)  You should now connect over the internet.\nIf that doesn't work, I suggest looking into TeamViewer.  It's a third party solution, you will need the software on both machines and it is a bit slower.  However it is much easier than configuring a router.\n", "Q: Left (or right) border in Apple's Pages I am writing a Pages (5.5.3) document for my Diploma thesis.\nI want to create a paragraph style for source code that has a colored border only on one side.

My mom already has a router and doesn't want to replace it but I still want to make sure she has a backup. She never has her MacBook connected so I'm looking for a wireless solution.\n\nA: You can still use a Time Capsule, just don't use it as a router. You can turn it's routing off by putting it in bridge mode (using the AirPort utility) and simply connecting a network cable between it and the existing router. You can turn wifi off as well if you don't want to use it, networking will happen via the existing wireless network.\nAs a somewhat cheaper yet officially supported alternative, an AirPort Express with an external USB drive works too. If the backups aren't too big, an older model works too, but since it's slower, big backups will take a while.\nAlternatively, any NAS with \"Time Machine Support\" works out of the box as well, QNAP and Sinology make those for example.\n\nA: Why don't you buy any (cheaper) NAS drive? The only requirement is to have a Time Machine Service, which most of them have. (Time Capsule is also a NAS, but restricted to Apple devices.) You can plug it into her router to do the basic setup. You should see it then as a valid Time Machine target drive.\n", "Q: Google search via AppleScript I would like to make a Google search with an AppleScript.

Try typing sudo tmutil disablelocal into the Terminal and enter your password, then turn Time Machine off and on,. If this is the same issue, in a minute or two the numbers should return to normal.\nWhat this does is it disables local time machine backups, which are occasionally useful if you don't backup often, or if you don't have access to your backup drive for an extended period of time, and would like to restore a recently modified document. It often bugs out in various ways.\n", "Q: Transfer files between partitions? After using Boot Camp to install Windows on my Mac, is there any way to transfer files between the two partitions as each is only read only to the other.\nThis is mainly because I have run out of space on one partition and was wondering if I was able to download files to my main Mac partition which will be used on my windows side, or is the formatting incorrect for this process.\n\nA: You may use some third party tools like Paragon-NTFS. It installs a driver on the Mac side that reads the NTFS partition of your Windows side. Some years ago I used the free \"FUSE\" drivers, but it seems to me, the development has stopped. \nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/index.html\nAnother solution would be to use a USB thumb drive, which is FAT-formatted as a transfer volume.

Snow Leopard requires 5 GB of free hard drive disk space and 1 GB of RAM.  (I don't know how much RAM I have.) Yosemite requires 5.64 GB. \n\nA: Every iMac from the mid-2007 release onwards can run Yosemite, and the last model that couldn't could also only address 3GB of RAM.

After using it for around a month I decided to pay more and buy the original one for the sake of my battery health. After opening the box and plugin it in, it just didn't light up, I've tried many times and nothing.\nThe new charger works on my girlfriends MacBook without any problems and the fake one still works on mine! Both chargers are 60W MagSafe 2 (the proper one).\nI tried reseting SMC and PRAM, but no luck.\nDid anyone have this problem, what could it be?\n\nA: Sounds like a DC-In board or logic board issue. It could be possible that the fake one cooked the parts of the logic board which provide the onewire communication between the SMC and adapter. Before you go replacing parts, make sure the contacts are clean on both the rMBP and MS2 adapter. Ensure no pins are pushed in and stuck on the adapter. Also ensure that the DC-In board did not get pushed in.\nIf it is new enough, it should still be covered under AppleCare, and you can take it into a ACSP for them to take a look at. Don't mention any fake charger should you take it in for service. If you're lucky, it's just a DC board, so here's hoping.\nSorry I can't provide much more help, it's hard to diagnose HW problems without having the machine in front of me with known-good parts to swap and test.\n\nA: Just try to open your MacBook Pro's back cover, unplug the cable from the battery to the logic board. Keep it unplugged for a couple of seconds.\nThen reconnect the cable from the battery to the logic board an reassemble the cover of your MacBook Pro, reconnect the charger and it should be all good to go.\n", "Q: Can't update from OSX 10.9.5 to OSX Yosemite 10.10 I bought my 13 inch non-retina MacBook Pro on December 2013. It's got...\n4 GB of 1600 MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n500 GB 5400-rpm hard drive\nTo update to OSX Yosemite 10.10 takes 5.64 GB. So does it mean I CAN'T update from 10.9.5 to 10.10 OSX Yosemite with my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: I think you are misreading the numbers.\nYosemite takes a little more than 5 Gig.\nYour Hard drive is 500 Gig. Even if you have used (consumed) lots of it, if you still have about 10 Gig of free space you can upgrade to Yosemite.\nTo look how much space you have on your Hard drive: \nClick on the top left Apple symbol and then on the About this Mac.\nIn the new window click on \"More Info\", now click on the Storage Tab.\nIt looks like this on my Mac, showing I have 108 Gig free.\n\nThe other storage is called RAM (that is not your hard disk). Yosemite needs minimum 2 Gig and you have 4 Gig, so no problem there.\n\nA: You have 4GB of RAM. RAM however in this case doesn't impact whether or not you can upgrade an OS. That 5G of space is hard drive space, not RAM. Since you have 100 times that on your hard drive, you should have plenty of room.\n\nA: If you are trying to update and it is not updating, you can always create a bootable USB drive with the installer of OS X 10.10.x, boot your system using alt key, choose to boot from the previously made USB drive and just say upgrade or open Disk Utilities, erase your drive and reinstall a fresh copy of your operating system.\nBut be sure to backup all your data before proceeding.\nTo create a bootable USB drive for your installer just search for creating bootable usb for Yosemite installer.\n", "Q: Trim Video and Overwrite Original I often need to trim videos and simply want to overwrite the original file.\nUsing QuickTime Player I need to\n\n\n*\n\n*open and trim the video\n\n*save the video to a new file (unfortunately it does not show the folder the original video is in)\n\n*find the new file and move it back to the original folder\n\n\nIs there a quicker way to do this?

I mean how many people who use OS X use chess.app?\n\nA: I have deleted Chess.app from every version of Mac OS X and OS X that I've used starting with Mac OS X 10.4.x and have never had an issue from doing so.\nYou can use AppCleaner to do it, although you first need to uncheck [] Protect default apps in its General Preferences.\nNote:  To all that have commented about not removing Chess.app, it is for each User to decide whether or not one wants to keep an app that is of no use to them and will have absolutely no side effect whatsoever in removing it, providing it's done in a safe manner.\n", "Q: Why does my USB hub hide a directly attached drive from the boot menu? (post-Filevault) I recently enabled FileVault on both my mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro and my external USB drive containing a Carbon Copy Cloner backup.\nMy external drive is attached directly to the MBP. I also have a powered USB hub attached to the MBP's other USB port (no drives are attached to the hub).\nSince enabling FileVault, I've noticed a peculiar behavior on the boot menu (holding option at startup):\n\n\n*\n\n*If I leave the hub attached during startup, the CCC drive doesn't show up in the boot menu.\n\n*If I leave the hub unplugged during startup, the CCC drive shows up.\n\n*Swapping the USB ports for the drive and hub changes nothing.\nAny ideas what the cause of this might be?\n(Side note: I've also noticed that both the internal recovery partition and CCC's recovery partition are missing from the menu. But that's apparently normal from what I've researched.)\n\nA: Its because the hub is able to connect drives so the hub shows it similar to how an empty optical drive shows up.\n", "Q: Why does the iMac not allow memory parity error checking? Based on this Apple support page, the iMacs (in particular the 2014 5K I just ordered) do not support parity checking on the memory.  From other articles, it appears ECC is not supported either.\nI find this surprising.  If there is a memory error, then the computer just goes along its merry way, propagating the error until it happens to cause some other detectable exception (like accessing an invalid memory address or running an invalid instruction).  Though it might not, and simply result in incorrect or corrupted data.\nI often do large numerical simulations, for which such an error would probably not cause a crash, but could likely propagate to a large error in the result.\nYou don't even need a cosmic ray to get an error.  The drive to pack to higher and higher densities inevitably results in vulnerabilities, such as row hammering.  One study measured an average rate of four errors per year per DIMM.\nWhat is the rationale for no parity checking?  I can see that ECC might slow things down a little and cost more, but at least a detected parity error could bring the system down instead of propagating an error silently.  65 bits instead of 64 bits would be a very small price to pay.  Even if it would make sense for a consumer to not have parity checking, I would at least like the ability to replace the memory to get parity checking.  It seems that even the DDR3 standard doesn't support just parity checking -- only ECC.\n\nA: This is not Apple specific at all. First, why is ECC (72-bit) used over parity? The reason is simply that DRAM chips have been made in data widths of 4, 8 or 16 bits for decades. ECC lets you simply add another commodity chip, instead of making a specific low-volume 5 bit chip. Besides, when you have parity, you can't correct any error, so all you can do is crash the computer when an error is detected. So the net effect is to cause more computer crashes, even if the error is in part of the RAM that is not in use.\nThere's two reasons why Apple can't put ECC in. One is simply the integrated memory controller Intel puts in does not support ECC to force workstation/server makers to buy the more expensive Xeon line. You can check the ECC supported processors on the Intel ARK.  You see it's only Xeons and low-end CPUs (server appliance market), but none in the Core i5 or i7 range.\nSecond, the SO-DIMM pinout simply lacks data pins for the 72 bit bus in order to shrink the size for laptops. Memory bus routing is very difficult and the extra 8 lines would also make it difficult for laptop motherboard manufacturers.\nMany numerical simulations do not require ECC. Real-world tests have suggested that the extra cost and speed penalty of ECC isn't worth it. As another example, some companies even tell you to turn off ECC.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 stolen iCloud accessed My daughter's phone was stolen. We reported it stolen to the police and the carrier. We told the carrier to discontinue the service to the phone. Then we received an email informing us that our iCloud had been accessed. What info can a hacker get from  her iCloud?\n\nA: Depending on the configuration, an attacker with access to iCloud may get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contacts.\n\n*Calendar.\n\n*Notes\n\n*Safari bookmarks, navigation history, reading list.\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Passbook contents.\n\n*Location of other Apple devices associated with the same account, with Find my iPhone on.\n\n*Photos taken with any Apple device associated to the same iCloud account, or shared with that account (if iCloud Photo Sharing or iCloud Photo Library was on).\n\n*Access to any document stored on iCloud (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, others).\n\n*A full backup of any iOS device stored on iCloud (including all information on any app installed up to the last backup made).\n\n\nChange your password immediately if you haven't done so yet.\nHaving your iOS device stolen and having your iCloud credentials compromised are two unrelated events, unless you happen to have your device unlocked, without password or pin, and have your iCloud password written in plain text somewhere inside of it.\n", "Q: Drawings on books purchased with iBooks Say I buy a book using iBooks (OS X Yosemite on a MacBook Pro). Using iBooks, I can highlight text and add notes. What about drawing shapes? e.g. circles, squares, arrows, etc. \nIf this is not possible with iBooks itself, is there any way to open a book bought with iBook on a different app with more editing support?\n\nA: If your books are really PDFs, and there are no security restrictions, you could use Adobe/Acrobat Reader with its commenting tools. \n", "Q: How do I maintain photo filters (e.g. Noir) when transferring from iPhone to iPhoto on MacBook? I love using my 5c photo filters but when I go to download photos into iPhoto on my MacBook Pro from my iPhone, the filters disappear. All my photos end up in color. How do I maintain the filters?\n\nA: I've asked this question at a GeniusBar in an AppleStore and also searched the web quite thoroughly on this.\nApparently, the only way to maintain the filters is with workarounds such as emailing the photos to yourself. \nBackground: Only the original photos (without the filter) are stored in the iPhone and iOS applies the filter every time you view the photos or use an iPhone App (like Mail) to export them. Apps from your Mac (like iPhoto) can only access the original photos.\n\nA: Since you have a Macbook Pro, you can try Airdrop also to send the photos to your Macbook . This will retain the filters. This is the necessary sacrifice for constructive editing feature of iOS . Treat Airdrop/sharing as export . This is the behavior with any constructive image editing application . \n", "Q: Can my messages be synced when I sign in on another iOS device? I have an iPhone and an iPod and I was using the same Apple ID on both devices but I changed my password on my iPhone. If I sign in on my iPod, will my messages from my iPhone be synced to my iPod?\n\nA: If you change your Apple ID password, all instances where it was used should prompt you to update it before using it.\nSo after changing your password, your iPhone iMessages won't be synced to your iPod.\nFrom the Apple Support page:\n\nThe next time you use Apple features and services that require an Apple ID, you’ll be asked to sign in with your new Apple ID password.\n\nAnd here:\n\nBy changing your Apple ID password you can prevent anyone from accessing your iCloud data or using other services (such as iMessage or iTunes) from your missing device.\n\nAfter you sign in again on your iPod, all new messages should be in sync, but in my experience it won't sync the messages in between the password change and the sign-in.\n", "Q: Copy a folder(and its internal structure), but only include specific files I have a folder(with subfolders and further subfolders) that the final folder has many different file types. These file types include images(.png/.jpeg), videos(.mov), and text files(.txt). But I would like to copy the entire folder(with the internal structure) and only include .mp3's. Does anyone have any ideas how do do this. (please do not say manually because there are 100+ folders and the folder itself is 60GB, so don't tell me to copy the whole folder) Preferably, I would like if someone was able to give me a solution where I can outright move the .mp3's(while preserving the folder structure)\n\nA: The following two commands, used in a Terminal, can accomplish what you've asked, the first creating a destination hierarchical directory structure containing the *.mp3 files and the second command deleting the *.mp3 files from the source hierarchical directory structure.\nNote: Make sure you have proper backups before using the second command as a mistype can be fatal.\nOpen Terminal.\nBy default Terminal opens to one's Home Directory so I'll use it as the example starting point and the Music directory as the source hierarchical directory structure.\nThis first command will make a copy of the Music hierarchical directory structure containing only *.mp3 files in the destination directory.  In other words after the first command is run there will be a destination directory containing that same hierarchical directory structure starting at Music within the destination directory that contains only *.mp3 files and only the directories from the source that contain *.mp3 files.  If a given source directory does not contain a *.mp3 file then that directory is not created in the destination directory hierarchical structure.\nNote: Full command line extends out of view without horizontal scrolling.\nfind ./Music -name \"*.mp3\" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR \"{}\" \"./mp3 files only/\"\n\nNote: Full command shown on two lines for clarity:\nfind ./Music -name \"*.mp3\" -type f -print0 | \\\nxargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR \"{}\" \"./mp3 files only/\"\n\nWhen the above command finishes there will be a directory in my Home Directory named \"mp3 files only\" and within that directory there will be a Music hierarchical directory structure containing only *.mp3 files.  Note: If the destination directory does not exist it will automatically be created.\nNow that the *.mp3 files have been copied from the source Music hierarchical directory structure to the \"mp3 files only\" directory the  *.mp3 files can be removed from the source Music hierarchical directory structure with the following command.\nfind  ./Music/ -name \"*.mp3\" -delete\n\nThat's it, the *.mp3 files along with their hierarchical directory structure  have been copied to a new location and the *.mp3 files deleted from the source.\n\nA: Without going to a somewhat complex command line script, I think copying the entire folder, and then searching for and deleting the files you don't want (easy through the Finder's search), would be the easiest way. Let me know if you want details (or, if copying the whole folder would indeed be anathema).\n", "Q: How to create a .app folder from an executable .jar? Just this. I have an executable jar that I'd like to create a .app folder for. Mainly just because I'd like it to be pinnable to the dock. \nIs there any easy way to do this?\nEdit: Really what I'm looking for, is a mac shortcut. But apparently on the .app folders can be pinned to a dock.\n\nA: If you want an easy way without need of third-party apps:\n\n*\n\n*Launch AppleScript editor\n\n\n*Write the following:\n--do shell script \"java -jar /Contents/execute.jar\"\nI commented that line out because we have yet to put the jar there. Save as application. Now Right click on produces .app file -> Show Package Contents, go to Contents and drag the .jar file there. Now go to Resources -> Scripts -> main.scpt and open that. Now remove the double dash (--), compile and save.\nIf it doesn't launch, try executing in terminal chmod 777 <path to jar file> simply drag the jar into Terminal.\nFor macOS Monterey (12.5) and other recent OS the tool is now called \"Script Editor\". Once you have a working script, saving as an Application makes it executable. This app has been around for decades, and was originally called AppleScript editor.\n\nA: How about Platypus?! It can pack \"all\" kinds of things, jar, py, script etc\ndownload from http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus, its GUI is relatively easy to follow.\n\n\nA: Do you have access to the source?

I'm not getting any search results from these folders so it appears Spotlight is not searching/indexing them. The folder can be found at:\nMacintosh HD/Library/FileMaker Server/HTTPServer/htdocs/\n\nI am getting search results for other Library folders, such as my web root folder at:\n/Library/WebServer/Documents/\n\nIs there a way to force Spotlight to also index the Library/FileMaker Server/HTTPServer/htdocs folder as well?\n(I want to index FileMaker Server's web root folder that I referenced above. I will not be indexing the FileMaker Server database folders as I have excluded those from Spotlight)\n\nA: Spotlight is already indexing those files and folders. You can check for the file names.\nThe actual problem is that the importer is ignoring the \"code\" portion of the files so the strings you want to find are not matching.\nmdfind -name fmwebd_home.html\n\nIf you copy a html file to your desktop, you can play with editing them to include strings inside the body of the html - and see if spotlight can find things. Junk names like ZZtestZZ are easy to make up that don't return other spotlight matches.\nmdfind  -interpret ZZtestZZ\n\nAlso, if you search in Spotlight graphically, you might want to save smart folders/searches that include the system files since they are normally suppressed from default searches.\n", "Q: Can not copy and paste within Chrome from time to time Chrome Mac is a bit dodgy, I can not use copy/paste function from time to time, both  Cmd ⌘   C   and right-click menu.

Other times it looked like an odd windows icon. \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: Try using Photo Gallery [part of Windows Essentials] which can download photos very similarly to how iPhoto does it - rather than trying to hack around the raw file structure, which was never meant to be played in.\n", "Q: How to let Xcode build apps and use playgrounds when parental control is enabled I would like to know how to let Xcode build apps and use playgrounds when parental control is enabled.\nIn fact app restriction is enabled, but even if Xcode is authorised it asks for authorisation every time when trying to build an app, and using playgrounds is simply impossible because it won't stop prompting for the authorisation even if it has been given.\nAny ideas ?\nEDIT : Now starting a bounty, don't hesitate to ask for details in the comments if you need them :)\n\nA: From my testing, I have found that if the \"Limit Applications\" check box in Parental Controls is turned off, but Xcode and the other applications that you want enabled are turned on in the \"Allowed Apps\" list, Xcode will only ask for authentication a few times:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the first run of Xcode\n\n*On the first attempt at running an app created with Xcode\n\n*On the first attempt at running a playground\n\n\nEven though it sounds weird to turn off Limit Applications, it seems like if the parental controls are set this way, Xcode will not repeatedly ask for authentication.\n", "Q: Split tunneling In Mac OS X I have an VPN application that creates a logical interface in OS X programmatically.\nOnce created, its configured with private IP and parameters and the Routing Table is updated accordingly.\nThe initially presented 'default gateway of the physical interface' is deleted.\nThe 'default gateway of the logical interface is added' programmatically.\nAfter sometime the Mac OS X system itself updates the routing table with the 'default gateway of the physical interface' and it looks like below\nDestination  Gateway     Flags     Refs     use     Netif     Expire\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\ndefault      xxx.xx.x.x     UGSc     1        0        en3   \ndefault      yyy.yyy.y.y    UGScI    1        0        en1   \n\n\n\n*\n\n*en3: logical interface created by application\n\n*en1: physical interface\n\n\nAccording to the above routing entries, all the traffic is routed to the logical interface created by application.

Got no control over it.\nEven if the application is prevented from adding the route for logical interface, the Mac OS X system updates the routing table and sets the default to the logical interface only.\nHence not able to achieve the requirement.\n\nA: Almost all vpn clients and servers support split tunneling. This is nearly always something you need to set up server side and not client side. \nIf you control the server side see Mac Pro: Splitting network traffic based on destination\nIf not, see Routing all traffic except a few IP-ranges though default gateway in Mountain Lion\n", "Q: To install GNU Cut in OSX?

For example can I somehow disable it using the sudoers file?\n\nA: I know you phrased the question in a way that makes me suspect you don't want to hear this answer, but you really should remove yourself from the sudoers file if you're prone to making the same mistake over and over.\nThe underlying problem is you haven't aliased rm to be move to trash (which is clearly how you are using it currently and in the past) or otherwise forced rm -r to be forced into rm -ri\nalias rm='/bin/rm -i'\n\nYou can always get around the alias with command rm -rf whatever once you've trained your mind on when measure twice, cut once is needed for rm -rf use.\n\nA: You can add a line like\n%admin ALL = !/bin/rm -rf /\n\nto your sudoers file to prevent the execution of the command with the specific options.\nOr, if you want to exclude several commands, you can work with command aliases\nCmnd_Alias DANGEROUS_CMNDS=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr /\n%admin ALL=!DANGEROUS_CMNDS\n\nYou can also try to play it safe by using\nCmnd_Alias DANGEROUS_CMNDS=/bin/rm -rf /, /bin/rm -fr /, /bin/rm / *, /bin/rm * /, /bin/rm -rf / *, /bin/rm -rf * /, /bin/rm -fr / *, /bin/rm -fr* /\n%admin ALL=!DANGEROUS_CMNDS\n\nbut there still might be other ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with rm so be careful anyway.\nBut keep in mind that all matching is done on the full string of the command, so sudo rm -rf /Volumes would still work (as would cd /; sudo rm -rf .).\nPS: By all means, use sudo visudo to edit the sudoers file and NEVER edit it directly\nPPS: I obviously didn't test this with rm (only with /bin/echo instead)\n", "Q: Upgraded to Yosemite, mkdir now says \"permission denied\" I upgraded from OS 10.7.3 to 10.10.3. Now I get \"permission denied\" when I run mkdir on folders that I own and have full permission.\nFor example :\n  I own a folder called \"/library/webserver/documents\". I try to make a subfolder and I get permission denied. I verified that I am logged in as the user that owns the folder. The permissions on it are 755.\nA few days ago, when I was still on 10.7.3, I did not have this problem.\nWhat is the solution? I don't want to simply type \"sudo [command]\" every time I want to make a folder. I just want to use the terminal like it worked before. \n\nA: I mentioned I owned the directory. I just found out that I actually owned the symbolic link to the directory. The user 'root' owned the directory. I chowned the directory and it works ok now.\nMy guess is either the upgrade changed the owner of the directory or else it changed the permissions logic regarding symbolic links.\n\nA: /Library and all subdirectories are owned by root\nI think upgrading the OS restored permissions.\nThe directory that you own that the web server can see used to be ~/Sites but since Mountain Lion setting this up is more complex not just tick click on an option in system preferences e.g see this article (NB it looks reasonable but I have not tried it)\n\nA: I see you didn't own the directory. Another tip to check the owner is issuing:\nnamei -l /path/to/directory\n\nNOTE: You have to port install namei because it is not native on mac\nAlso, repair disk permissions if some directory has incorrect permissions. If something has to be root and you don't want to type sudo everytime, the. you can issue sudo su or sudo - i* in startup which will provide you with a root console. Exit this by typing exit.\n*= If you want the difference between su and -i, refer to this. In a nutshell, -i is your user with elevated privileges, and su is a non login shell (root@root~#)\n", "Q: To give STDIN for Sed?

Once it reloaded, it informed me that everything was erased off of my phone. \nNow it won't let me use the Apple ID log in. It states that the owner used 'find my iPhone' to erase everything.\nI have never used 'Find my iPhone'. What is happening here?\n\nA: If you bought the phone from some other person, and not from an official store, the seller might have stolen the iPhone and sold it to you and now the owner is looking for it (I doubt it since you had it for 2 years)\nIf you bought your phone from the official store, your iCloud ID might have been hacked. The solution to activating it would be to go to an Apple store, prove to them that you are the rightful owner and they will reset it for you. After that, if you have a backup, restore the phone from the backup. Also, change your iCloud ID password Immediately. If you cannot log in, it might have been hijacked. In that case, click forgot password and reset from email.\n", "Q: Airdrop between newer and older macs without clicking the \"Search for an older Mac\" button I have a new MacBook Pro running Yosemite 10.10.3 and an older Mac Mini running Lion 10.7.5.\nAirdrop works in both directions, provided that if I am transferring from my MBP to my Mini, I click the \"Search for an older Mac\" button so that the MBP can see/find the Mini. After a few seconds of waiting, the older Mac Mini appears.\nI am wondering: any way to make it (via the Terminal most likely) such that my MacBook Pro is always searching for an older Mac? Why do we have to click a button to find older Macs? This seems like something that should just work.\n\nA: AirDrop was originally implemented using Bonjour/Bluetooth PAN (personal area network). Newer versions (starting with OS X Yosemite and iOS 7) support an improved version that's built on Bluetooth LE (iOS) and Wi-Fi (iOS, OS X), but also support the older implementation – you just have to tell it to look for those.\nSo, when you click \"Search for an Older Mac\", AirDrop actually switches from the newer Bluetooth LE/Wi-Fi implementation to the older Bonjour/Bluetooth PAN combo. Since they are two different protocols, they don't (can't?) show at the same time.\nThis iMore article, as well as WikiPedia, have additional info.\nEdit: It may be possible to show old Macs alongside newer ones if you set the BrowseAllInterfaces system default to true. I haven't done this yet to confirm, but it may be the ticket.\nRun this in Terminal:\n# Enable AirDrop over Ethernet and on unsupported Macs running Lion\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces -bool true\n\nFrom mathiasbynens/dotfiles.\nMy understanding is that this will allow AirDrop to run over Ethernet, but, more importantly, over Wi-Fi on technically unsupported (i.e. older) devices.\n", "Q: iOS 8.3 Ignoring Inline CSS I have an HTML email signature with Outlook.com where I can only use inline CSS.

Short of disabling the functionality completely, as shown in the other answer, you cannot affect it.\nThe reason the color works is because the colored text is part of the page being rendered - you are declaring during rendering that it should be black. The underline is not added until after the page is rendered, so you cannot affect it.\n\nA: You have to add the following meta tag in the head of the mail : \n<meta content=\"telephone=no\" name=\"format-detection\">\n\nBut beware : While this solves the branding/style issue, it also removes functionality that users may be accustomed to (and may prevent subscribers from being able to call you!).\n", "Q: Strange Macbook 13 Retina MagSafe port problem My Macbook Pro 13 Retina only charges (charger lights up and charges) if FIRST I plug the charger to the macbook THEN I join the metal part of the charger cable (see pictures).\nIf I do it the other way around: first join the metal part of the adapter cable and then plug it to the computer it doesn't charge. \nA new Adapter doesn't work because of this reason (it has the metal part soldered from factory)\nFirst I plug it to the laptop:\n\nThen I join the metal part of the cable:\n\nI'm not interested on fixing the charger, it won't work anyway as the problem seems to be the computer's Magsafe port.\nAny ideas what the problem can be or how to fix it?\nCan you explain me this behaviour?\n\nA: Apple MagSafe cables have one central shielded cable & one braided outer cable. You are simply breaking & creating a connection when you touch the broken braided cable - the order anomaly is the MagSafe/MacBook logic/sensor only allowing a particular state to operate.\nIt is possible to crack open a MagSafe and solder a 3rd party cable (but it will probably have 2 shielded internal cores and no braiding). Search YouTube for video (and note the risk of electrical shock even after several days of the MagSafe not being used). You will need the correct replacement part, long nose pliers to forcibly crack open the white  MagSafe shell, soldering iron, desoldering pump, locktite adhesive & activator, steady hands & patience.\nAlternatively pop into an Apple shop when they are least busy (in the UK 10am the shops are empty), borrow a MagSafe & do an SMC reset. If that doesn't work, an Apple diagnostic test is required (power/logic board) - store staff may run one out of goodwill (hence go when they're not busy)\n\nA: Have a look at Ken Shirriff's Teardown and exploration of Apple's Magsafe connector. It includes a pinout that will help you.\n\nA: Unless you know your way around electronics, a soldering iron and the like, it is doubtful you will be able to fix it.

That wasn't an issue until she tried playing one of the games, and it was like she had never played it before...when we tried connecting through her game center (it still showed she was on the level she should have been), it wouldn't work because she had an older version, and the new version requires her to connect through Facebook to save her progress...I refused to sign her up to Facebook (she's 7), so wondered if I could copy the app from my son's iPod (the version she had before the repair) and put it on her iPod?  Would it copy the older version so she can continue to play (and still have access to her friends through game center)?\n\nA: You can't really transfer apps between two IOS devices with different Apple IDs, unless you are up for jailbreaking, then I cant help you.\nIf you want to get the version your son uses on your daughter's device you will need to sign into the App Store with the AppleID on his device. But that will give you all of his settings as well. As you can see, problematic.\nHowever you mention an older version and the App Store will always download the most recent version compatible with your system. So you may end up with the same version you don't want.\nPerhaps there is someone else who knows a trick or two that I am not aware of, but if not you may be out of luck.\n", "Q: Transmit temporary file structure Transmit normally stores files at:\n~/Users/esemrow/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/300C3B29-9684-443B-9784-9316236D5795/index.php\nIs there a way to have it mimic the remote file structure?\ne.g. ~/Users/esemrow/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/domain.com/www/site/public_html/my_folder/index.php\n\nA: Not as far as I know currently, no.

Disk Utility now reports that there is only 26GB of my drive available. Not sure what is going on here, but I'd like to know where my 6GB of space went.\nUpdate: Zeroed the drive using DD, created new partition using Disk Utility, resized the partition and created a new one. It appears that for each of my partitions created, 6GB of the available space is taken up by something. The hidden files (Trashes, Spotlight, and fseventsd) do not account for this usage. This is really baffling and annoying, and any clue as to what is happening would be very appreciated.\nEdit: Pictures to clarify:\nProblem occurs on more than one drive, I think it has something to do with either journaling or local time machine backups.\n\n\n\nA: This is likely coming from one or two things (or both).\nPartitioning a disk, any disk, takes up drive space. In the megabyte range it is not even noticeable. In the gigabyte range it can be a substantial byte (sorry...) out of the drive. \nAlso computer makers and Drive/RAM makers often calculate bytes differently. O/S companies (Apple, Microsoft, etc...) call 1K 1024 bytes. Drive/RAM makers call 1K 1000 bytes. If you do the math it looks like you \"lost\" a lot of space when it is just different conventions.\nAlso formatting a drive will map out bad blocks. So depending on how many bad blocks there are that can reduce the size of the formatted volume as well.\n\nA: How old is the drive?\nFlash memory has limited write cycles, and it will slowly change into a read-only device. If you have been writing stuff to the drive for a few years it is quite possible some blocks have reached their write limit and the controller has marked them as unusable. Cheaper drive -> fewer cycles.\nAlso note that the one-pass-of-zeros secure erase method doesn't really work on solid state media, and it's another hit on the drive's write cycles.\n\nA: What does Finder report? How about turning Time Machine off and then back on? (deletes local snapshots)\nAlso maybe try Disk Utility>First Aid>Repair Disk\nHave you tried copying a large amount of data to these partitions? Copy something big to get to 90% maybe and then copy more and see when it says it's full. Sometimes Disk Utility reports incorrect capacity stats from what I've read. \n", "Q: Use iCloud storage space to free space from iPhone 5s I have purchased a 200 GB iCloud plan. I have a MacBook, an iPad Air and a iPhone 5s.\nMy phone keeps on popping up \"Storage Full\" every now and then. What should I do to utilise the purchased iCloud space and free my iPhone of space ?\n\nA: It will depend on the root cause of your storage being full, so start by checking on Settings > General > Usage, and select Manage Storage from there to have a detailed view.\n\nIn my case, pictures are using a lot of space, and podcasts are just behind.\nIf you click on any of the items on the lists, you get more granular options\n\nHere I clicked Music and I'm able to see which albums are using space.\nIf I slide \"All music\" to the left I and click Delete I can remove it from my iPhone from here, and recover 1,9 GB of space; of course you have to be cautious and be sure you have that music somewhere else (on your computer, on iTunes Match, or if you purchased it from iTunes Store, you can re download it when you need it).\n\nIf it is full of pictures and videos, you can activate iCloud Photo Library and store full versions on iCloud, keeping low resolution copies on your device; that will free up some space.\nIf it is music, iTunes Match or another streaming service will allow you to delete music and download —or stream— on demand.\nOther than that, check Whatsapp and iMessage which are huge space eaters —because of images and videos sent and received with those services; you can delete those images and videos if you have copies of what is worth saving.\niCloud will be very useful for backups and synchronized documents between your Apple devices, but your question indicates you hoped to somehow move some of your data from your device to the cloud, which is called selective syncing on other services (Google Drive, Dropbox); I couldn't find info on that —or similar— feature in iCloud, and I believe it's not possible.\n\nA: I have followed the instructions given by you and have succeeded in freeing up space by moving a lot of my photographs. Also, with a few other minor adjustments, as per your suggestions, my worry seems to be over. I truly appreciate the pains you have taken to explain things so vividly.

Spotlight use to be my one stop shop for typing anything that I needed information about. When it would fail, the result saying \"search in web\" would come up and that was a really nice fallback when that issue occurred because it generally sent me where I needed to go through Google.\nNow, Apple has decided that's not going to be a listed item any more thus forcing me to select all, cut everything I had typed, type safari and launch that, possibly open a new tab and paste the search in there. While I would be proud of that little combo of keyboard shortcuts, the old method was five steps faster so I feel a little foolish needing to do this now. \nMy question: is there a way to re-enable search the web or a tool somewhere in homebrew or github that will give me that back?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can use Flashlight Spotight plugin and install Google Search plugin. Then You'll be able to search Google inside Spotlight (just add g as a prefix). When You'll want to see the results in web browser, press ⏎ return. Here's an example: \n\nA: When you are searching with Finder, run your search and then click on the Gear menu in the Finder window toolbar.

If two people are sharing an Apple ID and one decides to download an app on their device will it show up downloaded on the other persons device? This may sound like a crazy question but I am pretty certain it can't happen but I was wanting to double check.\n\nA: It will if the iTunes settings on their device are configured to download purchases automatically. Below I have iTunes configured to update apps automatically, but could select apps and if my wife, who uses my Apple ID, bought a new app it would then show up on mine. She has this turned on for hers, so she automatically installs all apps I buy, but I have mine turned off so I don't get the latest coupon app she is trying unless I install it myself.\n\nThis setting can be changed without the Apple ID password, so you cannot be sure they won't get the app you install unless you check their device. You cannot change this setting remotely.\nYou can prevent an app from showing up in the purchased list of the app store, using iTunes on a computer. You cannot change whether it shows up as purchased if you go directly to the app.\nSo if it's an issue for you, here are your options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure they have the iTunes feature to auto download new purchases set to off (won't change the purchased list or app store indication of purchase)\n\n*Use iTunes to remove the app from the purchased list (won't stop auto downloads, nor ownership indication on the app page itself)\n\n*Use a different Apple ID (resolves all the above issues)\n\n\nA: You can set this up easily.\nTurn on Automatic App downloads in the settings app - be sure to observe if you allow or deny cellular data for downloading. That can prevent apps that are larger than a certain size from downloading over cellular or prohibit all cellular automatic downloads.\n\nA: If two devices have the same AppleID (typically what would happen if you have an iPhone and an iPad), then if an app is download on one device, it will change the icon in the App Store to show a cloud with an arrow rather then the \"Get\" or price button.\nAdditionally, depending on the iTunes & App Store settings in the Settings app, the apps may automatically download to the other device.\n\n", "Q: Slow Internet Mac Yosemite Recovery Doom (MacBook Air, Early 2015) Product: MacBook Air(early 2015) with OS X Yosemite.\nThe issue is, that I happen to have my Yosemite reinstalled, so I restarted my MacBook and at the sound of the chime(startup sound of Yosemite), I pressed ⌥ Opt+R and subsequently selected the Disk Utility. \nOnce into that, I erased my whole Macintosh HD and then restarted the computer\nafter which I was expecting the reinstall to be done automatically.\nI am a novice in the Mac world.\nNow once after the reinstall, I was forced into a screen with 4 options of reinstalling, Disk Utility, Time Machine and help from Apple.\nI tried to reinstall, but due to a slow internet connection, I wasn't able to reinstall using Internet Recovery.\nNow I created a bootable disk with \"InstallESD.dmg\" (using tansmac on windows)\nThis copy of installed is the one downloaded from macworld torrents.\nIt was after that I restarted the computer this time pressing only the ⌥ Opt key and then all I had was this black screen with a box that asked me for the network I had.\nI selected mine in a hope it might work with my USB but it just shows an Internet Recovery option with a globe which I cannot afford due to my slow internet connection.

Nothing happens when I press Shift and T. Keyboard shortcuts like Cmd+Shift+T don't work. Cmd+T works.\nTo get a capital T, I need to turn on Caps Lock or copy and paste it from somewhere.\nI enabled Verbose Boot by setting the kernel flags a long while ago. Maybe at the same time when the key stopped working right[1], after 20 lines of text the verbose boot kept typing in the $ character automatically until I pressed any key on the keyboard.\nI can fix this by attaching a non-Apple Keyboard, setting its layout and unplugging it, after which the Apple Keyboard starts working perfectly (which means there is no hardware problem). But when I reboot the key stops working again.\nAlso trying to press Shift+T in verbose boot does nothing, while other keys show up fine. Shift+T doesn't even work in Safari in Recovery Mode. I also can't reset the NVRAM by pressing Command+Option+P+R, it just takes me to recovery mode.\n[1]: I don't remember doing anything except setting up oh-my-zsh around this time\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the \"Keyboard\" preferences pane\n\n*In the \"Keyboard\" tab, turn on the \"Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar\" checkbox\n\n*Go to the new menu (it looks like a box with a command key clover-leaf in it) and choose \"Show Keyboard Viewer\"\n\n\nYou'll now see a window shaped like your keyboard, with every key shown, and each pressed key highlighted. Try out all the keys, especially the \"t\" and modifiers. Note that holding down \"shift\" will change the key display to capitals, and holding down \"option\" will change the key display to alternate characters. This should let you track down the problem, if it's in hardware.\n\nA: I happen to have run into this today though probably for an unrelated reason, but maybe this will help someone else. I had recently installed Snap Camera and bound Shift-T and Shift-O to actions in the app. What I didn't realize was that the app stayed open in the background (with a menubar icon) and was capturing those keystrokes as long as it was running.\nHolding down the Fn key is a good way to test for a hardware issue because the Shift-T and Shift-O keystrokes worked perfectly when holding down Fn.\nIt's likely this could happen for other apps that are doing systemwide keyboard capture of a specific keystroke.\nNote to self: Always add modifier keys like Command, Option, Control when binding keys in something that's going to be listening in the background.\n", "Q: How to not be asked for a password when modifying system files? I constantly tinker with my system files and other whatnot, and it's a pain to literally type in a password every single time I edit a system file. I am the only user on my computer. Any way to do this?\n\nA: There are a few ways to do so. You can either execute sudo su or sudo -i. This requires password once. Then you can issue any command without need of sudo (including modifying files). Or you can set a directory or file's permissions or owner by:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /directory/file.txt\n\nThis sets the permissions to read, write execute on the owning user, group and others.\nsudo chown -R username:users /directory/file.txt\n\nYou can make chown groups also.

However, when I open the file in Windows (with PDF X-Change) the equations all appear right.\nI don't know how the file was generated. Any idea of the cause of this issue?\n\nA: Though Adobe Acrobat (and Adobe Reader) is the official standard tool for displaying PDFs, there are a variety of third-party tools that could have been used to create a given PDF. Though the output from such third-party tools can be passable, the underlying construction of the page layout can vary wildly.\nUsing Adobe Acrobat, it is possible to use [Cmd + d] to view the document properties, including what tool was used to generate the PDF. I'm not certain if Adobe Reader has the same functionality.\n\nA: Does the file display properly in Acrobat/Reader? \nIt is well known that there are crappy and very crappy PDF viewers out there, which can be overwhelmed with a particular PDF. \nSecond check (in Acrobat/Reader using Cmd-D to display the document properties dialog) is whether all fonts are embedded.

How can I tell?\nSorry if this sounds vague, but I'm quite worried. Please let me know if you need more information.\n\nA: Try using one of the various temperature utilities to get the temperature of the hard drive.

I want to view those videos of the courseware on a mac. \n\nA: From the Udemy support site:\n\nIf you're using the Udemy mobile app, you can save courses to your\n  device for offline viewing. Unfortunately, courses cannot be\n  downloaded to a PC or Mac unless the instructor has made a lecture\n  available.\nIf an instructor has enabled downloading, you'll see the lecture under\n  the Supplemental Materials section to the right of the lecture. Click\n  on the second tab to check for any downloads:\n\nIf the lecture is not available to download, you can always send a\n  message to the instructor requesting that they enable downloading.\n  Some instructors are willing to make exceptions, but the final\n  decision is up to them\n\n.\n\nA: I'm adding another answer in case I misunderstood you:\nYou can make a backup of your iOS device with iTunes to your computer (Mac or PC) and browse it, but from googling around it appears that you'll need an app to be able to extract anything from it.\nI've found this article (\"Exploring the iPhone Backup made by iTunes\"), that identifies five categories of data inside of it:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*SQLite3 database files;\n  \n*Plain text plist files;\n  \n*Binary plist files;\n  \n*Multimedia and text files.\n  \n*Non-standard data file\n  \n\nMaybe some of the data your looking for is stored as multimedia files and is easily extracted.\nIf that is not the case, this answer talks about iExplorer being able to browse the phone itself; there's this other app that claims to do the same for free (on the backup, apparently).\nI haven't tried any of them, so I can't vouch for them.\n\nI've just downloaded and tried iFunbox, a free tool that lets you browse iOS devices as if they were external disks. I don't have Udemy installed but it seems very likely that if there is anything usable inside the app you will be able to copy it to your Mac with it.\n", "Q: Terminal command to delete everything I've ever created I have so much junk installed on my work laptop I want to start with a fresh machine. However, I must keep the account I have as I do not have system permissions to create another account. How can I use terminal to delete everything I (including use of git, brew, port, svn, etc) ever made?\n\nA: You don't have to neccesarily delete everything. Deleting everything would give you a hard time getting the computer to start or installing the OS. With Terminal, I suppose that sudo rm -rf / would delete everything.\nIf you want to start fresh, you can boot into Recovery ⌘ Cmd+R. Use only the ⌥ Opt key if you don't have FileVault installed because it has a root console. \nAnd then reinstall OS. Also, if you don't have permissions, I mentioned the root console. I am not exactly sure if Internet Recovery also has the console. \n", "Q: How do I configure my Terminal app with bash and iTerm2 with zshell and oh my zsh? The Terminal app uses bash by default. And I don't want to change it. However I want to configure iTerm2 with zshell and oh my zsh. and I don't want bash on it. The instructions I checked online, make zshell default in both apps.\n\nA: If your default system shell is bash, your Terminal should start with it. You can check it on General tab under Terminal Preferences. Should look like the following:\n\nIf bash isn't your default shell, you can change it by typing:\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nTo configure iTerm2 with zsh you have to open Preferences and change the command on General tab on your default profile. You have to enter /bin/zsh or whatever shell you want.\n\nTo install oh-my-zsh type the following:\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n\n\nA: Update Dec 2022\nYou need to go to:\n\n*\n\n*Preferences\n\n*Profiles tab\n\n*Select Command in the drop down\n\n*Enter /bin/zsh/ in the text input\n\n\n", "Q: Migration Assistant (MA) in Source remain \"looking for other computer\" state forever I am trying to migrate my data from one Mac to another.

Selected \"From another Mac…\" option and its able to see the source. I selected the source and clicked next. It then showed the code.\nHowever, the source is still stuck in the \"Looking for other computers\" state and does not progress.\n\nA: Can you ping one Mac from another? Look in the network control panel and find the IP address of each Mac. they should be similar. Like 192.168.01 and 192.168.0.2 where the IP address of each is only different in the last number. If that is not the case you can try assigning each a unique IP address manually and try again. failing that...\nCan you plug the computers directly in to each other with a plain Ethernet cable and reboot both while connected and then try again? The network control panel in that case should show both with a 169.x.x.x IP address that is different than the other Mac. If that is not happening assign each a manual IP address in the range of 192.168.0.x, where X is a number between 1 and 254 and different on each Mac \nThe other thing to try is to put the old system into target disk mode (Command-T while booting) and then connect the two with Thunderbolt or Firewire cables and run migration assistant in LOCAL mode. EG select the option to copy from a locally attached disk.\nAnother way would be to image the old Mac with Carbon Copy Cloner, SuperDuper or even Disk Utility to an external (USB or other) drive and then plug that into the new Mac and run Migration Assistant in local mode as above.\nExactly what is going on or why, I am unsure but those alternatives should help you get up and running.\n", "Q: is there a script to block outbound connection if vpn disconnects?

I haven't been able to charge my phone, due to the phone not responding or not reacting to the cable. My phone also will not turn on or attempt to charge. The Battery sign comes up but not the charging sign. Is it a battery problem? \n\nA: It could be the battery.  The phone is 3-4 years old.  However it could also be the charging cable or the port.  The battery symbol with a sliver of red just means the battery has no charge.\nIf you can, try using other charging cables to see if those are more successful in charging the phone.  \nIf different cables don't work, then try cleaning the contacts in the charging port.  Those can get dirty or corrode over time.  Try some of the tips here to clean the port: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/use-a-toothpick-to-clean-out-your-iphone/\nIf none of those work, you should look to try to replace the battery.  Apple can do this and there are 3rd party services like iFix that will charge $40 or so to replace the battery.\n\nA: I've seen this a bit. It's likely a charging port issue. Try giving it a clean as above, or maybe you can take it in for a fix, though that may run you something like $80.\n", "Q: Will changing an iCloud profile on iOS harm data on the previous account? I share an iCloud with my mom. If I delete iCloud on my phone, and created a individual one, Will it delete her data? \n\nA: Delete iCloud? You mean sign out I suppose.

You might need the previous password to continue.\n", "Q: Using iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos Simultaneously Does anybody have experience with this? Any best practice suggestsions? In my own research, I've learned the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop Uploader for Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Seems oblivious to iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*It offers to upload my \"iPhoto Library\", but this is no the same as the \"Photos\" library. The best I can apparently do is to point it to the \"Masters\" directory of the Photos (not iPhoto) library.\n\n\n*iOS App\n\n\n*\n\n*Seems more \"aware\" of the iCloud Photo Library, even offering to sync deletes on Google Photos BACK to the iCloud Photo library.\n\n*Biggest issues here is the Google Photos iOS App seems to forget the connection between the Google version of the photo and the iCloud version, displaying a \"merged\" version of the libraries. This has the appearance of MANY duplicates, where iCloud versions are identified by a small cloud icon.\n\n*The upload process is incredibly slow from iOS. I suspect this is due to the fact that it must first download the photo/video from iCloud prior to uploading to Google Photos.\n\n\n\nNumerous Google searches have not turned up any solutions. Has anybody successfully integrated these two services? If so, can you please share your solution or best practices?\n\nA: I have an iCloud library of about 25000 photos and videos, running on multiple iOS devices in \"optimized\" mode. Each device had to go through the complete backup process of uploading every image and video. Google Photos' iOS app will upload images first, then videos.\nWhich creates some problems on the iOS devices: With the \"optimized\" setting iOS only keeps the most recent or recently viewed assets in full resolution. Since google photos requests 100% of the full-size assets the iOS device, in my scenario, inevitably runs low on space for as long as google's upload process takes. Very. Annoying.\nBut fortunately I don't get any duplicates in google photos. I wish google would figure out a way to intelligently avoid having to upload what's already there, as this process, with a library of +150GB takes weeks.\n\nA: I get duplicates for my RW2 files which seem \"renamed\" on the iOS devices. Other than that, normal JPG files don't seem duplicated. However, each time I make an edit to a file in Apple Photos, it re-uploades to Google Photos.\n", "Q: OSX: Pick screen for notifications I recently hooked up 2 displays to my MacBook.\nNow the notifications always show up on my right screen. This means that I have to turn my head and in addition move my mouse a considerable long way to click on a notification.\nIs there a way to make the notifications show up on a different screen?\n\nA: Notifications appear on your primary display. The primary display is typically the one showing the menu bar; however, you can show the menu bar on every display.\nTo change your primary display:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.app > Displays\n\n*Select the Arrangement tab\n\n*Drag the menu bar to the desired display\n\n\n\n", "Q: Preventing automatic backtick ` When I type a backtick ` it's underlined and I can press space to make it this character ´.

I have a need to create a short slideshow style presentation (doesn't have to be a slideshow particularly if something else is more appropriate) which updates it's contents on the fly.\nThe content is fairly straightforward; number of laps done, distance covered - integers that slowly increase over a period of time but not at predictable intervals, interspersed with some static information that doesn't change.\nMy preference was to create a Keynote presentation, but other than stopping the presentation to update the slides, I don't know of a way in which is can be kept informed of updates.\nIs there a way for Keynote to pull updates (bit like the old the object linking and embedding thing Windows had once), for example can I include a Numbers file on particular slides which will get reloaded each time it hits that slide?  That way I can use a 2nd machine to keep updating the data, and have Keynote simply load it in?\n\nA: Here is how you can do that in Power Point. I do not use Keynote.\nThere are two ways to insert content objects into a PowerPoint presentation:\nLinked objects    A linked object is updated if its source file is changed. For example, a linked chart built from data in Microsoft Excel is changed if the source Excel data changes. The source file must be available on your computer or network to maintain the link between the inserted object and the source data. Inserting a linked object is recommended if the source data set is large or complex.\nEmbedded objects    The source data is embedded in the presentation. You can view the embedded object on another computer, because the source data is part of the presentation file.

Using disk utility on the Mac side, I partitioned it to be half Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and the other half ExFAT.\nBoth drives show perfectly well on my Mac, but when I boot in windows, it only shows my read-only Mac OS Extended partition and when I open the partition display in windows, it says that there is only one partition (unknown) and it is all unallocated.\nAlso, it already has files on the mac side so I don't really want to reformat if possible.\n--\nMacbook Pro Late 2013 13\" Intel i5 256GB\n\nA: From the Tom's Hardware Forum:\n\nBy default, the OSX disk utility creates a new partition as GUID. Windows can't read it. You need to create the partition type as MBR, which Windows can read. Then format as exFAT and both machines will read it.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, I created an exFat partition vía disk utility in OSX along with 2 other partitions (one for Time Machine to make OSX backups and other for bootcamp recovery backup of Win7 using a third party program).

So \"London\" is the same as \"london\".\n\n*Indeed it's possible to add a words with unicode characters, e.g. greek words and most likely in other languages, spaces, dashes etc. \nBut the system will take in consideration any accents in the words. \nWhen answering the security questions, you need to write the exact same word/phrase as it was typed - with the only exception of the upper/lower case.\nSo for example the greek word \"Αθήνα\" will be different than \"Αθηνα\", while the \"ΑΘΗΝΑ Ελλάδα\" will be the same as \"αθηνα ελλάδα\"\n\nThe above are what I have found out by experimenting with my security questions.

I've just moved 262GB of photos to a new external hard drive (1 TB), freeing up my MacBook Pro, 1 year old, which was dangerously low on space. I first backed them up on an existing external hard drive (also 1 TB). But now I see that this hard drive is getting full and Time Machine has started deleting older backups. That's ok. Currently the backups go to Jan 2015. But I need to keep the backup dated 2015.06.11 because that has all the photos I just deleted from the computer: these images are now on my new HD called \"Photos\" (and not formatted for Time Machine) and backed up in 2015.06.11 on the original ext. hard drive. So for now I'm okay, but in order to keep 2015.06.11 will I have to replace my backup ext. HD? Or is there some way I can tell Time Machine not to delete that one backup? Thanks.\n\nA: Some advice. I always back up my photos separately from Time Machine. You can save your images in a separate folder on the Time Machine drive and Time Machine will not overwrite them (used to do this with Apertures backup vault). \nAlso, depending on the space on your Time Machine drive, you could use time machine to backup your external Photos drive as as well.\nI would recommend that you have your photo's in at least two locations (which you currently have; however, Time Machine will eventually overwrite old data that is no longer on you hard drive if it needs the space).\n\nA: I recommend that you get a third drive (2-4 times the size of your non-Time Machine volumes).\nYour current Time Machine configuration doesn't really allow you to keep a snapshot of the backup dated 2015.06.11 (~900 GB) because none of your drives have enough free space to store it.\nAfter installing a 3rd external drive (with at least 2TB, the more, the better) and promoting it as your new Time Machine backup drive, you will be able to properly backup your internal drive as well as your external \"Photos\" drive in one Time Machine backup.

This is a TB drive with 800 gigs used... a lot of it for applications so reinstalling everything would eat my life and be virtually impossible. Any ideas on making the boot support partitions update so I don't have to go through that hell?\n\nA: Disk Utility repair functions are (from what I have heard) just a front end to FSCK, so that will likely give you the same results. You could try another disk repair utility (diskWarrior, techtool, etc...), or if you have a recent backup I would be tempted to wipe the drive and start over.\nIf you have another Mac you could put that Mac into target disk mode, connect the two via Firewire or Thunderbolt and try the repair that way.\nIt is possible that the drive itself is damaged and beyond repair. The problem here is that disk utility is usually not smart enough to know when to give up. And repairs can take a long time (overnight is not unheard of) so unrecoverably damaged disks often initially diagnose similar to what you are seeing.\nFailing other disk utilities or other Macs your best bet might be a visit to an Apple Genius. they will diagnose you for free, repairs may cost you if you are out of warranty.\n", "Q: is 8GB enough for iOS dev and occasional VM?

I have an aging 15\" MacBook Pro from 2007:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model ID: MacBookPro3,1\n\n*Model No.: A1226\n\n\nIn an attempt to squeeze a bit more life out of it, I've replaced the battery, upped the RAM, and I'm about to move to an SSD. BUT, I'm a bit stumped by what type of SSD to buy. MacTracker lists the specs for the hard drive as a \"1.5 Gbps Serial ATA (SATA)\". Interestingly, I've found that SATA2 and SATA3 drives are just as cheap as SATA (if not cheaper sometimes). \nWill one of these newer drives work? Will this old MacBook benefit from SATA2 or SATA3? Will it be worse off? Do SATA1, SATA2, and SATA3 all have the same connection type?\n\nA: The drive will be bound by the speed of the technology in your computer. 1.5Gbps is fast enough for the cheapest SSDs money can buy, but anything better than that is going to saturate the bandwidth. You'll definitely see a performance improvement over an HDD, even with this limitation, but don't go buying a high-performance SSD.\n", "Q: Formatting Boot Drive As Encrypted For Clean Install I don't know if my google-fu is broken today or something, but I can't seem to find any information about why I would or wouldn't want to erase and format an internal boot drive and/or partition thereof as Journaled, Extended prior to doing a clean OS install. Everything I've come across only mentions using Disk Utility to format an external storage drive as Journaled, Encrypted, using Disk Utility to format a boot drive/partition as Journaled or using File Vault to encrypt an already formatted drive. What differences are there between formatting the drive and partition as Journaled, Encrypted and then, also, turning on File Vault vs. formatting the drive and partition as simply Journaled and then turning on File Vault?\n\nA: If you format a drive as Encrypted, you are in fact turning on File Vault, as that's the only encryption layer that OS X supports. The main advantage of partitioning the drive as Journaled, and then turning on File Vault is that you can revert the drive to a simple unencrypted volume if you should choose to do so in the future. You can't do this with a volume that was formatted directly as Encrypted. Other than that, the end result is the same.\n", "Q: Downgrading from iOS 9 to 8.3 with 9 backup So I upgraded to the iOS 9 beta and it didn't take much time for me to decide I wanted 8.3 back. Nothing was really wrong, its just that there are a lot of major and minor glitches that I just couldn't deal with. So I did everything right, got the 8.3 download and restored my iPhone 6 from there. Before doing so I did a backup on iOS 9 so I could get all my photos and other data back. As soon as I got back to 8.3 I tried restoring from backup, but itunes tells me that my software is too old and that i would have to set my phone up as a new iphone. Considering I just got a new mac yesterday. I have no previous backups besides the iOS 9 one. I know what my problem is, I didn't backup on 8.3 before upgrading. I'm just wondering if anyone has had this problem or one similar and could give me some solutions or am I just stuck with iOS 9 beta until it officially releases?\n\nA: Restoring from backup wipes the device, installs the newest version of iOS, then restores the contents of the backup. Generally speaking the backup is version agnostic - you can restore a 7.1 backup directly onto a device running 8.3, for example. In this case the data in the backup is from a newer version (9 beta) than iTunes is installing on the device (8.3), so you can't restore that data.\nYour options are sticking with 9 beta, or starting over with a new phone experience on 8.3.\n", "Q: OS X 10.10.3 connects to wireless router but unable to resolve domain names I can connect my daughter's MacBook to the wireless router but not browse the internet with two different browsers (Firefox and Safari). This is a recent development as she has successfully browsed the net with this MacBook earlier. She says that she didn't change any settings.  \nHer MacBook is given an IP address by the wireless router's DHCP server.

It is curious that my Netgear router doesn't log any requests from the macbook. Also, the App Store on the macbook indicates that there are 2 items in the queue (icon in the dock) but when I click on that icon the App store doesn't finish loading (probably because it cannot connect [on a different port than 80???]).\nI also tried dig and nslookup. These both had connection time outs.\nThanks again for your help\n\nA: Ok, I've figured the problem out in my daughter's macbook. System>Network>Wi-Fi>Advanced DNS tab.

Not sure where the DNS servers that I replaced were from or how they got there. I also noticed that in my macbook (one of the ones that were working fine), the DNS server is the wifi router ipaddress. I'm not sure if I should use that or just stick with Googles.

I go to the \"Agreements, Tax, and Banking\" section and click \"Contact Info\" and fill that out. I then click the \"Done\" button on my screen. The dialog for it later disappears and so does my contact info. As in, when I go to select a contact for each thing listed there, the only thing selectable is Select.\nTypically, I'd ask this on Stack Overflow, but it's not about programming. It's simply about the final information that's somehow even more confusing and makes you want to throw even more inanimate objects across the room. Any ideas on how to fix this in the sense where I can actually select my information?\n\nA: I guess it worked after I tried it repetitively.

The only way I can think of is using Airplane Mode to stop pretty much all notifications (and internet + phone + text as well) and turning it on whenever you want to receive notifications. When you turn Airplane Mode off all of the notifications will come flooding in. You could even set a timer to remind you every hour to turn off Airplane Mode. This isn't the most convenient method, and it doesn't block local notifications (not used very much) but this is currently the best way I know.\nIf you would like a better way to be integrated into iOS, leave Apple feedback at http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html, and maybe next year this could be in iOS 10.\n", "Q: Project screencast of a Mac on remote controlled second computer I have 2 Macs (which I'll call A and B) and a video-projector.

If that matters.\nA recommendation for suitable non-Apple adapters would also be appreciated.\n\nA: Confirmed: for this to work you need two (not just one) active adapters on the Mini DisplayPorts.

I exported a set of photos from my wife's computer to mine over a WiFi share. I opened the directory in Finder and it said that there were 0 files. I know I've seen the Finder lag before on recognizing files in the folder, but this wasn't one of those cases.\nI went into the terminal and I could see all the files were there and these were not \"UNIX hidden\" filenames (i.e. prefixed with a period). However, I did notice that they had extended attributes for com.apple.FinderInfo and com.apple.quarantine. I removed both of these attributes figuring that might be it and now the files were simply -rw------- permissioned. I even chmod'd them to allow group/other permissions, however, they STILL didn't appear in the Finder. If I attempted to use the command open IMG_0123.JPG from the terminal (both before and after every action I tried), they would happily appear in the Preview application. I was finally able to see them after I copied them to a FAT32 partition and then copied them back.\nFWIW, the files were copied between Mavericks machines.\nSo my question is why would these files not appear in the Finder?\n\nA: On BSD you have a file flag that allows you to hide the file. \n$ chflags hidden path/to/file to hide a file. \nYou can see the flag with ls -lO \n$ ls -Ol foo.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 harry staff - 0 17 Jun 15:57 foo.txt\n$ chflags hidden foo.txt\n$ ls -Ol foo.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 harry staff hidden 0 17 Jun 15:57 foo.txt \n\n", "Q: How to make automator run an applescript that turns of mac?

They regularly make changes to the files on the server and need to tell somebody else about it. The other person wants to navigate to the files quickly without traversing the deep folder hierarchy in finder.\nI created a OSX service a while ago that let you select a file in finder, press a shortcut and paste a file:// link (or was ist smb://? I can't remember right now) in iChat. The receiving person could click that link, a Finder window opened with the correct file selected. Very convenient!\nNow the team abandoned iChat and uses Slack. So the browser is the place the link is clicked. How can I implement something like this in a browser? I want people to be able to click a link and have a finder window open in the correct location on the server.\nMy initial research says that it can't be done because file:// links don't really work from browsers.

This seems to only happen once however, and as far as I can tell, nothing other than the ctime is changing. This is very frustrating because it's messing with scripts that are checking for modification to the file, even when no modification is happening.\nBelow is an example of what I'm seeing. I create a new pdf file called test.pdf, everything looks good. Then I open it with Preview, do nothing, and close preview. Now the file has an updated access and change time, but not modified. As far as I can tell, everything else about the file is identical, it's as if the ctime was touched for no reason.

The precise why is probably complicated, but you can prevent it by removing write access (chmod a-w test.pdf) and then using preview on the file. Note, the chmod updates the ctime as well.\n\nMy guess is that metadata fields like kMDItemUsedDates and kMDItemLastUsedDate are the reason for ctime being updated. You can use mdls test.pdf to check those details before and after your tests.\n\nA: I've noticed this with images as well. When I open one in Preview, make changes to it, and \"force quit\" Preview, the changes persist even though I never saved them. I believe this happens because Preview autosaves your work by overwriting the original file. Most user don't notice this because when they close the program normally without saving, it reverts the changes and saves the file again.\nI think there are two reasons why it does this, the first is that since Macs handle shutdowns and restarts very nicely (i.e. able to keep all your work open and load you right back to where you left off) then all Apple-made programs probably have to autosave to make sure the shutdowns happen as smoothly as possible without loosing any of our work.\nThe other reason (in my opinion) is because of the way Macs show previews of file contents in their icons. Usually whenever you make changes to a file, the icon is automatically updated to reflect the changes you made. This is particularly noticeable with pictures. I think (and this is just a wild guess) that the way Preview makes the icon update is by periodically saving the file. Doing so allows Finder to handle any necessary icon updates on its own without needing any special integration with Preview.\nWhy does it need to save the file immediately on open even though no changes have been made? I don't know for sure but I would guess it might have something to do with the way Preview handles files in memory: I've noticed that when you make a lot of changes to a high resolution image in preview, you actually loose a noticeable amount of free space on your disk. This means that Preview must store some of it's memory to disk rather than RAM.\nJust a thought. Not sure if it's right or not.\n\nA: For info, the ctime change is perhaps not directly related to the \"Preview\" application since the same thing happens when I open two videos from the command line using \"open\", which then launches VLC to show them.  If I open them using VLC directly the ctimes are not changed.  Also, if I open only one file either via \"open\" or directly with VLC, the times are not changed.\nCuriously, if I use \"open\" on JPG files (which it opens in \"Preview\"), the effect is the same as described above for the PDF file: all the files' ctimes are updated regardless of whether the command opened just one or many files.  I wonder why this is different for video files.\nI don't imagine that \"Preview\" uses \"open\" (they both probably use lower-level Mac-specific I/O routines directly).\nI echo the annoyance of the original poster above.  The open operation seems to be messing around with the target files' inodes.  Why this should be done for read-only operations is an Apple-only mystery.  And unfortunate.\n", "Q: google photos backup app Will Google Photos Backup avoid creating duplicates if I use the app to upload from two separate computers with overlapping photo collections in Mac Os Photos?﻿\n\nA: Google photos does a really good job of deduping!

I have a 256GB SSD in my 5,5 MacBook Pro running OSX 10.10.1.\nIt's mostly filled up, mostly with music. When I get close enough to \"full\" I usually delete the less-important stuff to free up a good 5-10GB, then slowly that free space disappears, even though I haven't downloaded anything (besides streaming Netflix, browsing the internet, etc).\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: Sadly for you, lots goes on in storage.\nApple has several caching and thinning features that will proactively reclaim space when you run low. Unfortunately, you'll likely need to maintain more like 15 GB of free space if you wish to surf on the wave Apple has set for you.\nTo solve this, you'll need to be specific about how you are measuring free space and track that over time. You'll get different answers about \"how much space\" is free depending on which tool does the measuring.\nSo, if you can afford to relocate 30 GB of files temporarily, do that and see once things stabilize and Apple's cleaned things up. Then you can measure and rejigger things.\nIf you can't afford that - then you'll need to dive into things and not count on the \"automatic transmission\" to shift gears.

This will prompt your iCloud connection to update the information it is displaying. If it does not update, sign out of iCloud, restart your iPhone, and sign back in.  \nAdditionally, you may want to download the Ookla Speedtest app from the app store, and check the speed of your internet connection, as that is the most likely culprit of a slow backup, but will be a separate question as it involves router settings, and/or your Internet Provider. \n", "Q: Where is Rsync's default temp directory?

I used to use iPhoto, and my photo library was around ~40GB+ in size. When I upgraded to Yosemite, I was forced to use the \"Photos\" app which \"migrated\" my photos.\nWhen I open my home folder. The \"Pictures\" folder is ~130GB+ in size! When I open it I see:\n\niPhoto Library - 44.81GB (Migrated Photo Library) Photos Library 2 -\n  44.51GB (Photos Library) Photos Library.photoslibrary_prepare - 43.85GB (Folder)\n\nI can't use iPhoto anymore because Yosemite doesn't let me. I have time machine backups. I just want to delete the duplicate library, but I don't know how to verify that they are indeed duplicates, or somehow connected to Photos. I want to still be able to access my photos on my mac. I used to use Aperture as well, but Yosemite has rendered it useless.\nWhat is the best way to clean up the duplicates (if they really are duplicates), without losing my photos ? I'm fine \"using\" the Photos \"App\". :(\nEDIT:\nI deleted iPhoto Library and Photos Library.photoslibrary_prepare.\nI emptied my trash after that.\nI opened photos, and it seems to be working.

If I add up the sizes of all the folders under \"Macintosh HD\", there should be 110GB of free space (out of 500GB), but OS X reports only 77GB free. So where is the missing 33GB?\n\nA: See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/180313/54484\nThe files were not duplicated, rather additional hard links were created. The data exists once, and each hard link is simply a pointer to that data on the hard drive.\nDeleting one library will not recover any significant space, because hard links to the same data still exist. Finder shows the size for each library bundle as including the hard linked files, so it appears that much more space is being used, when it is in fact not.\nAs far as your \"missing\" 33 GB, unless you have turned on the display of hidden folders you are not getting an accurate count by simply counting the size of visible folders. Use something like Daisy Disk for a true view of what space is being taken up and where.\nFinally, for the record, both Aperture and iPhoto work fine under Yosemite, so long as you don't delete the libraries they used. They cannot read a Photos format library.\n", "Q: PPTP VPN not working on Yosemite 10.10.3 with OS X Server 4.1 I've set up a VPN on my Mac mini using Server 4.1 with the \"L2TP and PPTP\" option set.

H.265 (or HEVC) is the official successor to H.264, with a significant reduction in bitrate for the same picture quality.\nHowever it's not supported widely yet, including in Quicktime, iTunes or Quick Look in the Finder (cmd+space) and I haven't seen anyone talking about support in OSX 10.11 (El Capitan).\nI can view files in, for example, VLC, but was wondering if there's any sort of plugin for Quick Look.\n\nA: QuickLook's API is not all that great. It's meant for documents that can be displayed in a single frame, like text or photographs. There is no way that I know of (or apparently anyone else) to have QuickLook play movies. Apple obviously can, but they're clearly using APIs that the rest of us do not have access to.\n\nA: QLVideo can display metadata, thumbnails and static QuickLook previews of H.265 video (as long as the H.265 stream is packaged within a suitable container e.g. .mkv, .ts, etc).\nGiven the architecture of the QuickLook and QuickLookUI frameworks only Apple can add support for playable QuickLook previews. There's some discussion of this under QLVideo Issue#3.\n\nA: It has been a long while since this was posted, but as QuickLook still doesn't show previews of HEVC streams in MP4 containers by default, I will add my 2 cents for the Googlers who will end up here trying to find a solution.\nApple operating systems expect the \"hvc1\" tag to properly recognise HEVC streams in MP4 containers.\nOnce this tag is added, macOS will properly display QuickLook previews, iTunes will properly recognise the video for the purpose of syncing with devices, and supporting devices like iPhones will recognise the video for playback from Gallery.\nExample using ffmpeg:\n# -tag:v hvc1 enables support by most Apple devices\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v hevc_videotoolbox -q:v 65 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a copy output.mp4\n\n", "Q: unlocking iphone 5s from network Does anyone know how to unlock an iphone 5s from its network, so any sim can be used.

It's a fairly straight forward process [in the UK anyway!].\nI think there is possibly a method if you jail break the handset but this obviously carries other risks too.\nBeware black market unlocking services, there are lots of scams out there!!\n\nA: Each Carrier has their own process for this.  My carrier is US AT&T, to find my carriers instructions I Googled \"AT&T device unlock\" and was immediately led to this page.  I could post links to more carriers device unlock pages but that list would never be complete for a worldwide audience.  The correct page for your carrier is most likely not hard to find via Google.\nFWIW, usually the original customer must request the device unlock, someone who has already purchased a phone from a private party would not be able to request the unlock without help from the original owner.\nAs mentioned briefly in another answer, carriers lock devices to their network and will not unlock them until the original contract has been completed.  What's actually happening is the carrier has discounted the initial cost of the phone.  This discount means the carrier would suffer an immediate loss if the customer simply cancelled and sold the phone.  The lock to the network ensures the customer can't do that.  Once the terms of the original contract have been met the carrier will unlock.\n", "Q: Battery problems on MacBook Air I have a 13\" mid-2012 MBA, which runs fine except one thing: in the past year the original battery started to deplete its charge quickly and now only holds about 50% of the original capacity. \nSo I decided to buy a new battery and bought one on eBay from as seller with extremely positive reviews. I replaced the original one and was happy for a short while - everything seemed great. \nFrom time to time my Mac stops seeing the battery and I get a \"no battery available\" status and a X on the battery icon. Sometimes it goes away by itself after a fairly long time, once I had to replug the battery for this to go away. When I see this warning, mac goes to sleep immediately after unplugging it.\nIs there anything I can do about it? SMC reset doesn't help. \n\nA: You should only use the original Apple battery. You can read everywhere that cheap other brand batteries are s**t and go broke very soon or immediately. (The same goes for batteries for cameras).\nPerhaps you can recover your money from Ebay.\n", "Q: Sharing wifi from mac to iphone I Googled how to do share my wifi connection from my Mac (new Macbook Pro)  to my iPhone (5S) and I tried their way.\nSystem Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing\nbut then i don't have the same options they showed me. \nI have share your connection from: Thunderbolt bridge, wi-fi, bluetooth PAN, and bluetooth DUN.  \nWhen I choose wifi, which is what I'm supposed to chose from what i've read, I only get two options in the to computers using: Thunderbolt bridge and bluetooth pan but no wifi and neither is working \nAll the other share you connection from options allow me to do so with computers using wifi thunderbolt bridge and bluetooth pan. \nWhat should I do? Thanks \n\nA: Can you please attach a screenshot?\nYou should have this screen in your sharing options (System Preference - Sharing):\n\n\n\nA: This are the steps to share your Ethernet / Thunderbolt Ethernet internet connection through Wi-Fi:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your Mac is connected to the internet via Ethernet / Thunderbolt ethernet. It should look something like this on Preferences > Network. The green dot to the left of the interface suggests it's correctly connected and has internet access. To make sure, you may turn Wi-Fi off and try to browse.\n \n\n*Go to Preferences > Sharing, and look to the right of the preferences window for \"Share your connection from:\" and select \"Thunderbolt Ethernet\" (or Ethernet if your mac has an ethernet port) in the drop-down menu to the right; below that it says \"To computers using\", check \"Wi-Fi\" on the list. This must be done while Internet Sharing is off, or you won't be able to change anything.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check the settings of the Wireless network you will be creating by clicking on Wi-Fi Options...\n\nHere you set the \n\n\n*\n\n*Network Name (the SSID, that will appear on the list when looking for Wi-Fi on the devices that connect to this network)\n\n*Channel, which you can leave as it is (choosing the right channel requires a whole other answer).\n\n*Security: WPA2 is recommended; \"none\" will allow anybody who can see your network to connect to it, which is very insecure\n\n*Password, where you will create a password with at least 8 characters, ideally not 12345678\n\n*Verify, where you will enter the same password again to be sure there are no typos.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate Internet Sharing on the list to the left of the Sharing Preferences Pane. A warning should pop-up; if you are at home or connected directly to your ISP you shouldn't have problems, but check with them first. If you are inside a corporate network, better check with IT before sharing internet in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're sure you won't disrupt anything, activate Internet sharing by clicking Start\nThis is what it looks like when activated.\n\nYou should be able to find the Wi-Fi network on other devices.\n", "Q: Clean install Mac, restore backup without command line tools So, I'm a developer with brew installed along with several other programs installed from source(openCV, boost etc.). I want to do a clean install of OSX(to get rid of some other issues as well), then restore from a time machine backup(I have important apps and files I need to restore). Is there any way I can exclude my user installed command line tools from the restore? (effectively, starting afresh there?) \nEDIT: I've just discovered you can exclude the system folder. This should do the trick, right?\n\nA: So, in totality, deselecting \"System\" worked. I now have a clean slate, while the rest of my apps still work.\n", "Q: iPhoto on Mac doesn't download the full iCloud photo library My iCloud account is already set up and contains several years worth of photos.\nIf I log in to my iCloud account from a new iPad, I understand that only the last 60 days worth of photos will be downloaded to the iPad.\nBut I had also understood that if I log in to my iCloud account on new Macbook, all the iCloud photo library, not just the last 60 days, will appear in iPhoto/Photo (after setting the appropriate iCloud System Preferences, and the iCloud preferences within iPhoto/Photos).\nYet even on a Mac I am only getting the last 60 days of photos. How do I get iPhoto/Photos to download the full iCloud photo library?\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library needs to be enabled in Settings (on iOS or OS X) devices and then the photos will sync. Also make sure the devices are up to date.\nI have just been through the process on a replacement iPhone (iOS 8.3). I setup the device on Friday (12 June 2015) and only today (18 June 2015) did my Photo's application show the correct count of photos (approx 25000). The most recent ones have thumbnails already and the older ones are still getting them. I did not realize when I setup the device that it was still on iOS 8.0 (Photo Library was marked as Beta) so that could have contributed to the delayed sync.\nThis device has been on wifi networks (work / home) for the majority of the time since configuration. Please note that this post is from South Africa where both of these connections top out at 10 mbps on a good day.\n", "Q: Apple Developer Account enrollment language I'm trying to get enrolled to apple developer program so i can publish my apps on the app store, currently i live in Turkey so whenever i open the enrollment page to pay 100 USD the website redirects me to the Turkish version and change the currency to Turkish Lira, i don't speak Turkish and i don't want my account to be in Turkish, so my question is: will i be stuck with a Turkish developer account or i can change the language after i pay ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Well, it turns out that it doesn't matter, you can have English tools and documentations.\nAnd i'm very frustrated with the users of this website. No one answered ?! not even comment. \n", "Q: Missing Mail.app in Finder, but exists in /Applications folder I've not ever wanted to use the Mail app on my Mavericks machine, but recently I decided I'd give it a shot. However when I went to Applications in Finder, I couldn't see it. Nor was it in ~/Applications (which is completely empty anyway).\n\nWhen I did a search from Terminal (find . -iname Mail.app), I discover that it is in the /Applications folder after all.\nI checked the permissions, but have never seen the \"@\" before:\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 XXXX   admin    102 21 Feb  2014 MacX Free AVI Video Converter.app/\ndrwxr-xr-x@  3 root   wheel    102 16 Jul  2014 Mail.app/\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root   wheel    102 16 Jul  2014 Maps.app/\n\nThe only way I could seem to open it was via Terminal (open /Applications/Mail.app).\nDoes anyone have any idea on why it might not be visible in Finder? \nNote: The app itself is running fine after opening from Terminal...\n& I've since marked it as \"Keep in Dock\".\nMany thanks,\nCraig.\n\nA: Thanks to the hint from @Zero, there is a way to Hide and Show individual files, including applications from Finder by using Terminal. \nTo Show individual files:\nsudo chflags nohidden Mail.app/\n\nTo Hide individual files:\nsudo chflags hidden Mail.app/\n\nDepending upon the file, you may not need to use sudo, but it won't hurt in any case (other than needing to type in a password).\nDisclaimer: I found the key to my answer mentioned in a comment here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/65175/84492\n", "Q: Enable wifi hotspot on Macbook Pro Mid 2014 I am trying to share the internet connection from my MBP Mid 2014. It seems I can only share the internet through the Thunderbolt Bridge or Bluetooth PAN but I need it through the wifi for my Mobile device.\nIs there any way I can share the internet connection

(Hold Shift during start up)\nThat will eliminate 99% of foreign applications causing the problem.\nThat will also show if it is a hardware problem. Sometimes it is enough to start in Safe mode to fix small problems.\nIf problem continues, run the Apple Hardware test, that might show problems with hardware. (hold \"D\" during start up).\nFor more clearer picture of your system, I recommend to run the EterSoft analytical tool. EtreCheck is a simple little app to display the important details of your system configuration.\n\nA: The best way to resolve hardware RAM issues is to isolate this around one of the sticks of RAM. This is most likely a hardware issue, that will only show as a bunch of random software impacts, making it really hard to diagnose.\nRemove all the RAM, and put in only one new 4GB stick in, then start the Mac. If it boots and runs, then you have a good stick. Try the other one. \nIf the Mac won't boot with either, then try mixing a 2GB with a 4GB stick, as you already know your 2x 2GB sticks work. (sometimes you need both DIMM slots filled).\n\nA: Your Etrecheck report shows the RAM to be OK.\n\n8 GB RAM Upgradeable\n    BANK 0/DIMM0\n\n        4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz ok\n\n    BANK 1/DIMM0\n\n        4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz ok\n\n\nIt also shows some obsoleted start up items that you can remove.\n\nStartup Items:\nHWNetMgr: Path: /Library/StartupItems/HWNetMgr\n\nHWPortDetect: Path: /Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect\n\nStartOuc: Path: /Library/StartupItems/StartOuc\n\nStartup items are obsolete in OS X Yosemite\n\n\n", "Q: Why does my LaunchAgent return ROOT as the user?

This key is only applicable when launchd is\n       running as root.\n\nSo You can add this key to Your plist to specify the User.\n", "Q: Total per month of daily values I would like to have a total per month in second table of the first table\nI would like the table to be separated and I would like the process to be automated: typing the month and year in one cell and having the spreadsheet calculate the total for that month. (it means i can keep data in a tab and just import/update it when I need without caring about which month stops where).\nIn my data table I have 2 columns: one is a date, the other a value\nSeptember 2014  114\nSeptember 2014  89\nSeptember 2014  109\nSeptember 2014  85\nSeptember 2014  96\nSeptember 2014  93\nSeptember 2014  96\nSeptember 2014  118\nOctober 2014    107\nOctober 2014    98\nOctober 2014    79\nOctober 2014    67\nOctober 2014    86\nOctober 2014    141\nOctober 2014    92\n\nThe formula I'm using is:\n=SUMIF(Date,\"=\"&A2,Count)\n\nDate is the date column in the first table;\nin A2 i have the month and year (as mentioned above)—but this only returns the first value found for the month…\nI tried using MONTH(Date) but it is not working; would you have any suggestions?\nEDIT\nmy dates in the raw data table are formatted as follow:\n01/09/2014 00:00:00\n\nthey are indeed Date, not String, so the SUMIF appears to be failing on this. How could I convert those Dates into Strings so the comparison inside SUMIF works?\n\n\n\nA: Using the SUM(IF) function:\nBecause Numbers does not yet support certain Array functions, for example extracting MONTH(A1:A23), by parsing the date into a third column (which can be hidden) the function will work. This column can be in any table, not just the raw data table as long as the references are valid.\nHidden column formula:\n=MONTH(A1)&YEAR(A1)\n\nWhere A1 is the cell with date.\nCopy down then hide column if desired.  (Importing more data by adding rows should automatically bring the formula down but unhide the column to be sure.)\n=SUMIF($'Month & Year',\"=\"&MONTH($A1)&YEAR($A1),$Value)\n\nFrom the documentation regarding SUMIF():\n\nThe SUMIF function returns the sum of a collection of numbers, including only numbers that satisfy a specified condition.\nSUMIF(test-values, condition, sum-values)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*test-values: The collection containing the values to be tested.    test-values can contain any value.\n  \n*condition: An expression that can include comparison operators, constants, the ampersand concatenation operator, and references.

This is because I want to dual boot with Windows 8.1 and make a reserve drive for when El Capitan comes out so I can test it without my computer becoming buggy. The only issue is I can only split my Mac into 2 partitions. How would I do this? I also tried doing this in recovery mode and it did not work. Would I have to use a 3rd party tool like GParted? If so would it be safe and would I loose my recovery partitions if I do?\n\nA: Thanks to @tubedogg for linking me to this post and giving me the tips.\nTo fix the issue I had to run the commands diskutil cs revert <disk id> and diskutil cs resizeStack (Not sure if that worked since I think it game me an error).\nI had to reboot for the effects to change and I partitioned my drive in recovery mode (think you can do it within OS X though).\n\nA: You will not be able to split your drive into more than two partitions and still be able to boot Windows. There is a hard limit on the number of partitions on the boot drive for Windows (may be for Mac and Linux too, not sure).\nYou can certainly dual boot Mac and Windows (or Mac/Linux) but not all three on one drive.\nIf you follow the instructions in creating bootable windows install media from Bootcamp it will boot from the media and present you with a partition map that allows you to re-partition the HD for Windows/Mac O/S dual boot.\nI have found that doing it manually, outside of BootCamp is generally not a good idea for whatever reason.\nyes you should be able to boot into recovery mode and adjust the partitioning there. but I would only do that with explicit instructions in front of you for installing your favorite Linux distro. So it is done correctly. Otherwise do the repartitioning of your boot drive with the BootCamp installer.\n", "Q: Only hibernate when closing the lid, display sleep otherwise? I am looking for a way to hibernate (i.e. RAM saved to HDD then turned off) only when closing the lid.

You could do that now, and it might let software updates download, maybe even install. It also might not.\nYou could remove /var/folders, but I've seen a system that didn't like that. If the permissions on it are mangled and you'd like to try without it, I recommend renaming it in single user mode first.\n", "Q: Songs from iPhone won't transfer to iTunes on my PC I have bought many songs on my iPhone from the iTunes store, but when I tried to transfer them onto the computer into my iTunes, it won't work. It worked with some, but not all. \n\nA: You can't transfer music from iPhone to iTunes. You can only transfer music iTunes to iPhone. This is to prevent music from being pirated easily.\nIf you purchased the music directly from iTunes, all you need to do is make certain that you have iTunes signed on to the same Apple ID and download your purchases directly. You won't be charged if you already purchased via your iPhone. In iTunes go to Store > Check for available downloads.\n\nA: Not sure about the legality of this, but there exist ways to transfer non-purchased songs from iPhone to iTunes. If you are on Mac, try Senuti (iTunes spelled backwards, mind the pun). If you are on Windows, try CopyTrans.\n", "Q: The full size of the Fusion Drive is not available for repartitioning Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've found so many similar questions but none that match mine exactly.\nI created a partion on my 2013 iMac in order to test out the Yosemite upgrade.

Unfortunately, you can't specify 100% like you can with many commands.\n", "Q: iCloud on a broken device So two days ago, i dropped my (already cracked) iPhone 6 in water, and it was in there for over a minute. I ran home and in less than 5 minutes, it was in rice. After 24 hours, i tried turning it on, nothing happened. I tried charging it for about ten minutes, and nothing was happening, so i put it back in rice. And although how to fix my phone would be helpful to know, that's not my question. Ir seems pretty hopeless to recover the phone, I am a photographer and just want to know how to get the photos and videos off of there. I have iCloud turned o on it, but i am 95% positive i turned off photo sharing. Is there any way I can still recover the photos? My life will be ruined if I can't, i love my phone more than my family and don't know what to do. Any suggestions? (or just how to get the phone working again) \n\nA: If you have iCloud backup and iCloud photos/Photo Stream turned on then the photos should be accessible to you when you restore your new phone from iCloud.\nPhoto Stream should also be available to you if you have iCloud photos turned on via icloud.com.\nIf not you may have to see if Apple or a 3rd-party repair shop can get your old phone working to get the pics off of it.\n", "Q: Windows XP doesn't recognize devices on Mac I installed a Windows XP on an iMac beside Mac OS X. When i start Windows XP it appears that it doesn't recognize devices like network card, sound card and video card as well as other devices. It cannot connect to the internet, so i am trying to download the device drivers from the Mac OS. \nIs there any way to do that, any links where can I download the drivers necessary for Windows XP to recognize all devices?\n\nA: Plug in a USB drive that is formatted with FAT while on Mac OS and run Bootcamp Utility, then select the download Windows drivers option. Reboot back into Windows and run Bootcamp.exe/Setup.exe either from AutoPlay or manually.\n", "Q: Waterproof Watch case? I am looking at getting a tough armor spigen case, and I hear the Watch can survive a shower. The spigen case seems to cover all but the Digital Crown. I am not comfortable even with rain on the watch unless I can swim with it. Assuming I use this case, about how far under water can I go if at all? And is there a better option?\n\nA: A lot of people have had the same concern. I know someone tested this thoroughly. I wouldn't do what he did, but I wouldn't be so worried, though I can't say I've taken my Apple Watch into the shower yet.\nThis upcoming case from Lunatik may work as far as cases go. You can watch their Kickstarter video here. However, I don't believe there are any other casing options that also offer waterproofing.\nYou also asked about alternatives. Liquipel, which is a nano-coating that would protect your watch from water damage (they call it Watersafe), seems like a viable option. There are plenty of articles about it online. The only strange thing about it is that after late September, the articles seem to disappear. I haven't been able to find anything following that date.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find specs detailing how deep one would be able to go with either protection. Regardless, the Epik Watch from Lunatik seems like the most resistant or safe option at the moment, given their video and the lack of information on Liquipel. If Liquipel is still around, and you're willing to dish out the cash (it's a pricey combo to some extent with Liquipel for iPhone going for $60 and the Epik Watch going for $100), perhaps using both wouldn't be a bad idea.\n", "Q: OS X Case-sensitive issues? It's been a few years since I tried a case-sensitive install of OS X and I'm wondering how it is these days? I had to revert to case-insensitivity before due to Adobe CS but I think that's fixed now.\nI recently had an issue deploying code to a linux server and having a js require statement fail due to case differences. Took me awhile to realize the issue.\nIf there aren't any major problems I'll probably do a clean, case-sensitive install of El Capitan this fall.\nHere's a similar question but old: HFS+ case-sensitive or case-insensitive -- which type to use for the primary drive partition?\n\nA: Recent Experience\nFor what it's worth, I recently used a loner MacBook Pro for a week while mine was in the shop. Because I mostly use my mac to develop software for unix servers (typically using case-sensitive ext4 file systems) I decided to give HFS+ case-sensitive another try.\nFor me, all core OS X applications worked perfectly and I didn't notice any stability issues with the system at all. Also, most of my third-party software worked without a hiccup.\nBut there were exceptions. When I decide to give this a go, I already had in mind a number of programs I expected to break, and a few of them did. Most notably, ALL Adobe software refused to run. Because Creative Cloud requires that it is installed on your boot volume, a case-sensitive boot disk is a show stopper.\nGenerally, though, there are better-built alternatives to these brittle codebases. For example, I began using Affinity's Designer and Photo instead of Illustrator and Photoshop, which almost perfectly fit my use cases.\nThere were a few pleasant surprises: Backblaze continued to work and Microsoft's Remote Desktop was still able to be used.\nI don't have any other Microsoft programs so I can't comment about Office apps, etc, which might be a bit iffy.\nMy Plans\nOnce every few years, I totally rebuild my system from scratch instead of upgrading. I'm planning to do this when El Capitan is officially released, and I will be using a case-sensitive file system. As I see it: any software that is unable to run with case sensitivity is probably not something I want to be running at all. If there is something that I absolutely need, I can always run it inside a case-insensitive VirtualBox VM.\n[[ Update 2015-10-15 ]]\nI've now been on HFS+ Case Sensitive for over 2 weeks on El Capitan, and I haven't had a single issue. Of course I haven't even bothered to install the software I knew wouldn't work (Adobe), but I haven't run into an issue with any Apple software, App Store apps, or open source code. If you spend a good amount of time developing for unix systems, I'd highly recommend making the leap.\n[[ Update 2016-09-23 ]]\nWell, it's been about a year now, and I'm never going back. I'd encourage all developers to always use a case sensitive filesystem. Also, it should be noted that the successor to HFS+, APFS, will become the default filesystem for macOS, iOS, and watchOS next Spring, and as of now it's only available as case sensitive.\n\nA: Just tried to setup El Capitan on a case-sensitive partition. Sadly, Adobe Creative Cloud still requires case-insensitivity. So, it was a total nonstarter for me. YMMV with other apps. \n\nA: Another simple solution: a very small USB drive, encrypted and HFS + case sensitive filesystem. change Apache config, and that is my new webroot.\nIf I lose it, it is encrypted, so it is useless for the new owner, and I always have a backup with time machine, so creating a new USB takes literally 4 minutes.\n", "Q: Dashboard massively consume CPU and memory I have set my dashboard as overlapped in system preferences, and I despite I have few widgets on it (just a calculator, a calendar and a clock), it takes all my CPU and memory:  \n\n\nFor now I've just disabled, but I find it useful and I'd like to know if there's a way to fix it.\n\nA: I seem to be getting the same issue. Even more interestingly, when I remove that digital clock widget, Dashboard seems to always freeze. It would seem likely that Big Digital Clock is the culprit here. It must be running in some sort of loop that not only makes its RAM usage balloon, but prevents Dashboard from closing it, and causes it to freeze.\n\nThis is after only a few minutes. Then I tried to remove Big Digital Clock, and Dashboard has been \"Not Responding\" ever since, although its RAM usage keeps climbing. Although this doesn't happen immediately. It would seem that the clock needs to be running for a few minutes before it exhibits this bug.\nEDIT: It would seem the steps to trigger this bug are as follows (there may be a step or two in here not necessary, but this does it). Do this after removing all widgets to start fresh:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add Big Digital Clock\n\n*Add calculator\n\n*Do 2 + 2 (or some arbitrary calculation that you can hold down the enter key for awhile with) and hold down Enter for like 20 seconds\n\n*Delete Calculator\n\n*Add Calculator\n\n\nAfter these steps are completed, Dashboard should start to bloat in a few minutes. You'll know you've done it right if you start seeing small CPU usage spikes with Dashboard every 15 seconds (this may be related to the 20 seconds or so of holding down return in calculator). After Dashboard bloats to about 1 GB of RAM, trying to get rid of Big Digital Clock, results in Dashboard going unresponsive.\nThe solution seems to be to remove Big Digital Clock, as it seems to be the source of this systematic bloat. Let me know if this experiment works for anyone else.\n\nA: My Dashboard was running at 37% of CPU for a while. That's the 3.5 GHz Intel Core i5 in a Retina iMac of 2014 vintage. What seems to help is to cycle Dashboard off and then on again in Mission Control (in System Preferences). Good luck.\n\nA: I had a delay before I could start interacting with dashboard apps (e.g. type into calculator).

I keep being stuck with Apple's Java 6. I have no idea how Apple's Java 6 ended up on my computer in the first place. \nI keep putting \"java -version\" into the terminal and it comes out telling me I'm still running 6...\nHow do I remove Java 6? All I want to do is manage to run a Minecraft server, but it demands Java 8.\n(I'm running Mac OS X Yosemite, in case that is relevant, because I can't find any up-to-date tutorials on how to do this) \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you want to remove Java 6... From How to properly uninstall Java 6 on OSX?, do the following:\n\nRemove the \"system\" JVM installed and maintained by Software Update\n% sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk\n\nRemove any Java Developer Previews\n% sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0*.jdk\n\nDo NOT remove any content in the JavaVM.framework. Those items are\n  required by Java 7, 8, 9+ as well as Java SE 6. No modern version of\n  OS X has a Java JDK inside there anyway.\n\nThen to have Java 8 run from the Terminal when using java -version you need to install the JDK not JRE.\nNote: I've tested the instructions here under OS X 10,10.3 and it works however maybe you had installed Java 6 for use by some application that needed it, as an example I installed Apples Java 6 to run muCommander however it will run under Java 8 too. \n\nA: Try installing Java Development Kit (JDK). I did and Terminal showed RE was using Java 8.\nI had to do the same thing with Java 7 as well.\n", "Q: Unable to be Repaired & Further Problems I'll start off with some information about my USB. I use a SeaGate external hard drive USB with 1 TB. About ~250 gb of it is partitioned and formatted to create a Time-Machine compatible partition. The rest of it is just a normal partition, formatted exFAT, which I use to store data.\nI use a 2013 Macbook Air on the latest version of Yosemite.\nThis drive was working fine until last night, when I attempted to resize it (with iPartition, so I could keep my data) to give the Time Machine Partition just a bit more room. It seems to have worked, but immediately following that OSX gave me a message saying that the larger partition (which I called MISC) was unable to be repaired and should be backed up and reformatted (or something along those lines) ASAP. My Time Machine partition (which I called OSX) seems to be working properly, but I haven't made any new back-ups since then. As far as I can tell, this would not have happened without the iPartition, but I can't be sure.\nI really do not want to lose all my data, since I have no way to back up. This is my only large USB and my hard drive is too small to contain the data I had there. So, I am currently trying to use Drive Genius 3 to repair it (only MISC, but I'm fine with it if I can only repair the entire hard drive at once) WITHOUT losing my data. However, it seems I'm not able to repair it because it's set to read only (this was said in an error message given by Drive Genius). I checked the MISC partition using the \"Get Info\" tab, and it seems that it is set to read only. However, I'm unable to change permissions. I'm pretty sure this is due to whatever caused OSX to give me the message saying that it was unable to be repaired (Disk Utility gives the same message; it also said something like, \"You are not able to write to this drive\"). It only says something along the lines of, \"You may only read this drive.\" When I get home, I will provide more clear quotes. It doesn't give me options to change the permissions, so I can't just do that.\nMy questions are:\n1. How do I change the permissions on the MISC partition? I'm ok with just forcing this through Terminal if that would work.\n     a. Would Drive Genius actually be able to fix it? Because if not, then there's no point in trying.\n2. Are there any other ways to fix this problem without losing all my data?\n     a. Note: I'm fine with losing my OSX partition's data, because I can just make a new back-up (and also that partition works fine and doesn't have an error message).\nIf I can't do this using Drive Genius, unless you guys give me some other possibility, I'll try to use testdisk 7.0 for the task. I'm not quite familiar with it, so if anyone has experience with it that would be greatly appreciated. Failing that, I'll simply have to do it the regular way that involves losing all my data.\nI'm really terrible at a lot of this stuff, so I'll need a lot of handholding unfortunately. Please provide screenshots if possible (and I will do so as well!) for your instructions, especially if it involves Terminal, but mostly for anything. If you know of any programs that might be able to do this, even if they cost money, please link them to me!\nThanks for the help!\n\nA: \n\n*You need to buy a new drive onto which you will copy your data from the borked drive. Preferably, this new drive will be a brand other than Seagate, which has the worst failure records in the industry. Once you have safely copied your data to the new drive, you can then begin to worry about how to deal with the Seagate drive.\n\n\nA: You can try following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*run the following command in Terminal: diskutil list\n\n*Find your disk label in the \"NAME\" column, and note the identifier all the way on the right (something like \"disk#s#\")\n\n*Now run this command: diskutil unmount MISC\n\n*Next run: sudo mkdir /Volumes/MISC && sudo mount -w -t exfat /dev/disk#s# /Volumes/MISC replacing \"disk#s#\" with your identifier\n\n\nTry running a repair in Genius 3 again. Hopefully it should work now.\n", "Q: Do I have a stuck pixel on my iPod touch 5? So, today I picked up my iPod touch 5th generation to use it as normal, and after a few minutes of use, I noticed that a there was a vary tiny white dot at the top of my screen, and about half way from the middle of the screen to the end.\nI thought it might be a stuck pixel, but it's not always the same tone of white.

(It even does a really good job of telling the difference between when I say \"scroll down\" as a command and when I say it as part of a sentence.)\nBUT I can't for the life of me get any custom commands to work. For example, I have tried to bind \"Close this\" to cmd-w, and \"tooth paste\" to \"success\" (as an experiment). \nI can't get dictation to recognize these commands, ever. I seem to be following the steps shown on every tutorial. It just doesn't seem to work.\n(FWIW, I can't get many other commands to work either. For instance, \"select previous word\" will happily write that text, without dictation realizing that it has just recognized a command! About half the time that I select something and say \"delete\", it performs a delete, and the other half of the time, it writes the word delete.)\n\nA: I have been experimenting with the dictation app a lot recently since some  RSI issues. Had issue with user created commands at first. Not sure if you got yours working yet but we'll add my scenario and fix for general FYI:\n\n\n*\n\n*multiple choices of the same app in the app List : for example Google Chrome showed up twice. When I created a user command and chose the first Google Chrome app in the list. User created command did not work. When I chose a second Google Chrome option it works. Somehow and I'll have to sort that out I have multiple choices of the same app. So maybe check that.\n\n*increased memory: overall dictation working better since I increased memory on my computer from four gigabytes to sixteen. Actually a whole lot better. And I know dictation uses a lot of your memory. For example if you open up Activity Monitor you can see the resources being used and what application using it. And when you're low on memory features in certain applications are sacrificed or affected.\n\n\nOne last suggestion or maybe more of a qualification Beyond your OS what hardware are you working with – ie what type of Mac product an what year–information found in About this Mac\n\nA: I think I've found the solution to the custom commands. Open your accessibility preferences and press \"Dictation Commands\". At the bottom \"Advanced Commands\" must be checked. From there, you can enable all of your user-created commands.\n", "Q: I want to use my iPad as a multi-video monitor I have four wired video cameras on my RV, and would to replace the monitor with my old iPad.

Under:\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Advanced Options > Aliases:\nThere are 2 lines. One is my Apple ID. The second is in the form\ncom.apple.idms.GUID\n\nWhat is the significance of these fields?\nI do not have my Apple ID set to login my computer. \n\nA: A user name alias functions as a simple way to create a shorthand version of an account name. \nFor example, if a users full account name is “Buscar웃SD” (which would be difficult to type every time to log in), one could setup an alias as “BSD” and just login with the shortened version instead.\n\nA: Ruskes answer is correct historically. I believe it is still true, but nowadays anything in advanced preferences must be approached with great caution.\nI think it's might be safe to add an additional alias there, but be careful about removing any. It's not clear what the com.apple.idms.appleid.prd.GUID or similar Aliases mean, but a 2017 Apple Discussion response suggests some are related to Apple Store identifiers particularly when a user's Apple Store ID differs from their iCloud ID. When I browse Mojave's Diretory Uility.app's Directory Editor for my user account the RecordName keyvalue pair shows both my macOS name and a string of the form com.apple.idms.appleid.prd....\nI think as Apple has integrated macOS with their Cloud services and legacy problems with user identifiers they've extended the use of Users & Groups Aliases to bind together identifiers on different services.\nIn 2019 we should probably forget that \"Advanced Options\" exists at all (except perhaps for changing one's shell)\n", "Q: Why can't I delete Chess.app Why is Chess.app \"required by OS X\"?\nI don't use it, and I can't delete it.

Is it possible to give a custom name to a browser window on OS X?\nPerhaps by using a Window Manager that has this feature? If yes, which one has it?\nThe motivation for this question is : I have 100 browser tabs open, all on different topics. It would be great to cluster these 100 browser tabs into different browser windows, each having a meaningful name. \nFor example : \n\n\n*\n\n*1st browser window for cat pictures named \"cat pictures\", having 10 tabs open about cats\n\n*2nd browser window for Haskell programming, having 10 tabs about Haskell open, named \"Haskell\"\n\n*3rd browser window for Buying a new meachanical keyboard, where I have 10 different tabs open about different keyboard review sites...\nnamed \"keyboard\"\nAny idea how to do this on OS X?\n\nA: It is possible with this extension for Firefox:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firetitle/\n", "Q: What is the difference between iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream In my iPhone settings I have both set ON. What is the difference if I turn one or the other off?i\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library puts all your images in the cloud, allowing access from any device you are signed into. It requires enough space on iCloud to store all of your photos.\nPhoto Stream just shares your new photos with your other device, but they aren't actually in the cloud. This doesn't require you to have enough storage space for your photos.\n", "Q: How do I delete photos just from my iPhone not my iCloud Photo Library I have iCloud Photo Library enabled on my iPhone and it is set to be optimised on my iPhone.\nHow can I delete photos off my iPhone OR is this optimise feature going to do this for me, to free up space on my iPhone?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple does not provide that information when you are about to delete a picture or albums. It would be nice if Apple would give us a Help option in the photos app that can also be removed if desired. Furthermore, I am not an expert on this subject but I will provide a sensible answer from my research, rather than making a comment that DOES NOT answer the question. But Hey, everybody is entitled to there opinions and comments. \nSo here it goes: \nHow do you eliminate a photo off your iPhone without eliminating it completely from my iCloud Photo Library and other devices?\nYou can’t, and it’s a little counter-intuitive as to why. You have to twist your head around to how Apple thinks of cloud storage for media. When you use iCloud Photo Library, the “truth” of your library is in the cloud—that means that the accurate, full, current state of all your images and other media are always stored on Apple’s servers, and the various places you can download or view images (Web, iOS, and OS X) are endpoints. (The only point in which that’s not true is when you have images that remain to be uploaded from an endpoint.)\nThus, if you delete an image in any associated app, you’re telling iCloud Photo Library to remove that image from its “truth,” which means to delete it from the central repository and sync that change to all endpoints. You can choose to only store optimized (low-resolution) media in iOS and OS X, but you can’t delete images in one place and expect them to remain elsewhere. And you can’t maintain separate local albums in Photos that aren’t synced. (In OS X, you can use alternate, non-synced libraries, however, choosing them when you launch Photos. In iOS, you can use alternate photo apps that can have their own libraries, too.)\nIf you want the ability to delete images from an iPhone or any device without deleting it from all your devices, you have to disable iCloud Photo Library and use another form of sync or another service, like Dropbox, Google Photos, or Amazon Cloud Drive.\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/3058175/photography/the-problem-with-deleting-photos-from-your-device-with-icloud-photo-library-enabled.html\n\nA: The optimization feature is supposed to free up space automatically by keeping low res versions of your pictures.\nFrom the Apple support site:\n\nIf you turn on Optimize [device] Storage, iCloud Photo Library will automatically manage the size of your library on your device, so you can make the most of your device's storage and access more photos than ever. All of your original, full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud while device-size versions are kept on your device. You can download the original photos and videos over Wi-Fi or cellular when you need them. \n\n\nA: First you need to disable iCloud Photo library option from settings and then you can go to iTunes and follow this simple steps to delete entire photos album which you have imported from your computer.\nStep #1. Connect your iPhone to your computer with USB cable.\nStep #2. Launch iTunes on your computer.\nStep #3. Click on iPhone icon.\nStep #4. Now click on Photos.\nStep #5. Uncheck the Sync Photos box.\nStep #6. A pop-up window will ask you to either Remove Photos or Keep Photos.\nStep #7. Click on Remove Photos.\nStep #8. Finally click on Apply button at the bottom right corner.\nRef:- http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-delete-photos-imported-to-iphone-from-pc-mac/\n\nA: Free Options [with more space]\nGoogle Photos\nIf you are trying to free up quite a bit of photos without them being a stock app, and not paying for storage, a possible option could be Google Photos. It will remove all photos from your device, sort them, and allow you to stylize them using different tools by Google. It also has a free up storage mode that may provide an easy way do delete the locally stored photos.\n\nMega.nz (Free Storage)\nAnother option is also mega.nz may be an option for libraries under 50 GB. It will store all photos in an encrypted cloud for free, generating a key that only you can unlock.\n", "Q: Remove Faces Permanently from Photos Library Is there a way to permanently remove a name from the faces in the new Photos app?\nExample:\nWhen you tag a face accidentally with \"John\" instead of \"John Miller\", you can delete the face associated with \"John\" and remove the \"John\" tag from all your photos, but \"John\" will still be suggested every time you tag a face and start with \"J...\". \nI guess this is especially annoying when you type fast and tag a lot of faces, where you will end up with dozens of typo/etc. names that will be suggested to you every time you enter a name...\n\nA: The iOS 12 and macOS 10.14 versions of Photos makes this significantly easier.\nSelect the face / person / name in question and then select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove this person (from macOS)\n\n*Remove (from iOS)\n\n\nThat purges the name and face from ones it will select in the People Album. I do see that both platforms will find names from your contacts, so if you just removed \"Mary\" from your album and you have any contacts with Mary in them, you will still get prompted. Temporarily deleting the contacts (make a backup) or deleting the sync of cloud contacts like iCloud and Outlook.com (or the many other contact sync options) you can test that Photos doesn't have that name anymore to suggest to you.\n", "Q: How to downgrade Safari from 8.0.6 to 8.0.4? I am investigating a website bug that seems to only occur in Safari 8.0.4 (Yosemite 10.10.2), but I am on 8.0.6 (Yosemite 10.10.3) already.\nIs there any way to downgrade Safari to the patchlevel I require that does not include restoring an old backup from Time Machine or reinstalling the OS?\n\nA: For testing environments I recommend using Parallels or VMware. You could do an install of Yosemite and then only install the updates needed.\nI usually create multiple virtual machines by creating a base VM, then copying it, doing a round of updates, then copy that one, then doing another round on the next copy, then repeat that process until I have all of the software versions I am looking for.\nKeep in mind that some of the software you may want to use will require a separate license for each virtual machine.\n", "Q: iMac 27\" mid 2011 black screen The Mac starts up and runs probably on thunderbolt to vga adapter but the built in screen remains black. It has an AMD HD 6770m graphics card so not the one under the repair program. \nAny ideas what could be the problem? \n\nA: Another possibility is your backlight may have gone bad.  You can check by holding a flashlight up to the display and looking closely.  If you can see the icons on your desktop once illuminated with the flashlight then your backlight is out.  This is a relatively simple repair you can have done at the Apple Store.\n", "Q: My I phone 6 some contacts not displayed with contact name only contact no displayed I purchased a new iPhone 6 and have problem with importing my contacts.

I checked my SIM contacts with another android mobile, it correctly displayed all contacts with contact names. \nHow can I Import my all contacts with names to my I phone?\n\nA: If you can see them correctly on android, it may be easier to export them from there to .vcf, .csv or whatever format it offers and trying to import them back to your iPhone. \nIf you have a Gmail account, uploading them into it or associating them to it will probably be a relatively easy solution. You can add your Gmail account to your iPhone and use it to sync your contacts.\n", "Q: Can we submit new TestFlight \"pre-release\" build while previous build is \"In Review\" (for beta review)? We submitted our app for beta review so that we can start using \"External Testers\" and go beyond the 25 person limit for Internal Testers. But while we are waiting for beta review to finish (currently \"In Review\") we need to keep testing internally and send out new builds. \nWhat doesn't work: While we were in review for one build, I tried changing the version to 1.0.1 (from 1.0) and updating the build #, and submitting a new build. That basically killed off the review process for the previous build and I had to re-submit for Beta Review for the new one.\nIs there any solution? \n\nA: No - you'll jam up the review if you don't let the first review complete once it is \"In Review\". Most of this is covered in the FAQ on iTunes Connect under Resources and Help.\nThe solution is to dig into the documentation (there's a video explaining the entire test flight process) and/or call Apple Developer support if you can't find the documentation on the web site.\nI used to know where the link to support was on developer.apple.com, but Apple recently re-jiggered things on the developer web site and it's not where I expected. I suppose you need to log in to iTunes Connect and get help there on the contact us page.\nThe main solution I've discovered is to be patient and not try to game the system by submitting a second build if the first is taking a while.\nIf your build was \"In Review\" see if you can call and have them resume that review with the original build. Getting that first review is crucial for having subsequent reviews go faster as they can refer to their internal testing notes and just look over what changed, spot check things rather than do all the work for an initial build. \n", "Q: Is there a way for locking the screen and putting it to sleep/activating the screen saver to be two different events on a MBP? This question is very similar to what I want to accomplish, except for the fact that I also want to be able to put the display to sleep at times without triggering it to ask me for a password. I basically want to be able to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*At times, lock the screen, much like I do in a PC by hitting Win+L. I'm fine with the screen going to sleep at this time, and if this step was all I wanted, hitting control+shift+power would do the trick if Require password [amount of time] after sleep or screen saver begins under System Preferences > Security was checked. However;\n\n*I also want to be able to, sometimes, just put the display to sleep or let it eventually start the screen saver without it asking for a password afterwards. I could also accomplish this one simply, if I unchecked Require password [amount of time] after sleep or screen saver begins under System Preferences > Security, but again that would make me unable to do what I wanted to do above. \n\n\nI can do this all in Windows by enabling the screen saver, and not checking the box that specifies that it'd get me to the login screen when on resume. That way, I can let the screen saver get triggered and the display eventually go to sleep and it won't ask me for a password when I resume; and I can also simply lock the session when I want to by hitting Win+L, and then the display will eventually go to sleep.\nIs this possible to accomplish in a Mac? \n\nA: There are a number of posts (here and here) on superuser.sx. \n\n\n*\n\n*To lock the screen (actually invoking the \"Login Window…\" action from the User menu, and a direct analog to the Win+L shortcut in Windows):\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n\n*To sleep the display (I use this all the time as part of my last command before bedtime on my home machine):\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nEither of these options can be invoked through a keyboard shortcut by tying a shell script to a shortcut (using Automator (like this), Quicksilver, LaunchBar, Alfred, etc., see this post). \nIt's worth noting that BetterTouchTool can also perform these actions (directly mapping shortcuts to actions like this), as noted in this answer to one of the prior questions). The developer has been giving the app some love recently, which has been wonderful to see. \n\nA: here is a solution, with mouse movements (not keyboard shortcuts). \nFOR THE FIRST PART\nGo to user & groups\n\nEnable fast switching. \n\nWhenever you need to activate the login screen click login screen on top right. It will need the login password to open again. \n\n(If you still need to define keyboard shortcut, please look this link, though I didn't test it, but it might probably work.\nhttp://www.macyourself.com/2013/01/27/how-to-lock-your-mac-screen-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/\n)\n\nFOR THE SECOND PART \nDisable \"require password\" option security & privacy section. \n1- In system preferences, select Mission Control,\n\n2- Then click on hot corners on lower left\n\n3- From there define your actions by assigning actions to each screen of your mac\n\n4- Here are the standard actions of mac, when you move your mouse to those corners of screen\n\nAnd next time when you move your mouse, your screen saver will be activated.\n", "Q: Is my UEFI bugged?

When I tried to eject drive it shows the error. After closing terminal, I could eject it. But is that really needed ? I didn't open any files in external disk. df -h just shows disk usage of all drives. Then how come terminal uses the drive and prevent from ejecting?\nThe disk “Vol” couldn’t be ejected because “Terminal” is using it\n\nA: If you cd- change directory to the mounted filesystem then you must cd out of the filesystem before you can eject it. As an example\ncd; diskutil eject /Volumes/<volume name>\n\ncd: changes the current working directory to your home folder\ndiskutil: ejects the filesystem\nThere is one case where the tab needs to be closed. Sometimes the initial working directory is on the volume. (This can happen if you open a new tab from an existing tab that is visiting the volume.) When this happens, two processes are initially using the volume: login, and the shell it launches. cd will change the working directory in the shell, but won't affect the login process.

I'm going to use some GPL-covered code in my app. Firstly, I'm not sure if GPL is compatible with Apple's App Store, i.e. whether apps entirely covered by GPL can be published through App Store.\nSecond, iOS does not allow 3rd party dynamic libraries, which means, to my understanding, you can't legally combine GPL and non-GPL code in one iOS app.\nSo what are my options if I want to use some GPL code in my app?\n\nA: As this is a legal question you have to ask a lawyer about this, any answer on the internet (including this) is not reliable\nHowever The Free Software Foundation (which write the GPL) have written this blog about GPL v2 and the App Store http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement\nThis includes \n\nThat's the problem in a nutshell: Apple's Terms of Service impose restrictive limits on use and distribution for any software distributed through the App Store, and the GPL doesn't allow that. \n\n", "Q: Can I scrobble Google Music on iPhone?

How can I change my Apple ID to a new one? iTunes was taking money out of my bank account in unauthorised transactions. In total over 13 months they took over £1,000. My bank refunded my money & stopped iTunes their end. But now my account won't work & I've 16 apps that need updating & I can't as Apple ID won't let me!\n\nA: Your old Apple ID has presumably been disabled from purchasing apps since you initiated chargebacks with your bank for purchases. This in turn disables receiving updates as well.\nYou will need to create a new Apple ID. Then sign into the App Store on your device by tapping on App Store > Featured tab (if not already selected) > scroll to bottom > tap on Apple ID: your-old-id@email.com and select Sign Out. Go back to the same place to sign in with your new account. The first time you login you will need to add a payment method, even if you will only be getting free apps. I'd suggest not trying to add the payment method from the bank where you initiated the chargebacks, as that will probably simply serve to get the new account banned too.\nThe apps purchased with your old ID cannot be updated by your new ID, so you will need to delete them from your device, then re-purchase them (or in the case of free apps) re-download them. Either way, the app copies on your device right now will never be able to be updated, because they are permanently associated with your old ID.\nNote that by deleting the existing copies of the apps, you will probably lose app data. However, if you delete one and immediately re-purchase/re-download the same app with your new ID, the data may carry over - no promises, but I've seen it work before. Do not restart your device between deleting and re-downloading, as doing so will definitely cause the data to be lost. If this works for you, remove and re-download one app at a time so there are no problems with iOS removing the data before the app can be re-installed.\n", "Q: iMessages -> Screen Sharing - is there some trick to actually making this work? Every once in a while I'm chatting with a friend via iMessages on OSX, we're both on the same OSX version & all, and I decide to go \"hey, let's share screens\". I've tried this on and off with multiple computers and friends, but I can never get it to work.\nWhat am I missing? Do we have to be on the same network or something?\n\nA: I had to fight with this recently to screen share with my mother so hopefully I can shed some light on some issues you may be having. \nPer Apples support page on Screen Sharing:\n\nYou can share screens using AIM, Jabber, Google Talk, and Bonjour. You can’t share screens using iMessage or Yahoo!.\n\nThat being said, you'll want to go to the preferences pane of iMessages and make sure you have an account added and enabled that supports one of those protocols. In my case, I added my Google Talk account. The other person will ALSO need to have one of these accounts enabled and signed in. I would presume on the same service also.\nBack on the main iMessage window, you'll want to make sure you're signed into that account by looking at the bottom left hand corner of the window and making sure you're online.\nOnce that's done, you'll want to switch to the user you would like to screen share with and click on the details link in the top right. Then select the icon with the two overlapped screens, like below, and select the appropriate option.\n\nThe person on the receiving end of your screen share request should be able to accept it and that's that.\nI do remember there being some weirdness around some security issues with Google Talk so you may have to do some research about that if it doesn't work, but that's the general procedure I had to follow for it to work.\n", "Q: Change mail back to embedding attachments I wanted to attach a photo and not embed it so I did the following:\n\nIf you would like Mail to do this automatically with all attachments, try the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nRelaunch Mail for this to take effect.\n\nHow to automatically attach E-mail, not embed them\nI only wanted to do this temporarily, but now can't change it back.

Sometimes it can see the connection, but  the Internet won't work. \nNow, I also have this problem with Wi-Fi, it connects to a network but after random time Internet connection stops working. All other computers and phones are working with Ethernet and Wi-Fi; only the iMac isn't. \nI tried to do all tests and resets but nothing, today I formatted it returning from Yosemite to Snow Leopard but the problem is still there. Any solution?\n\n\nA: Just for grins and giggles...\nDid you verify that your cable and network port are good?  \nFirst thing to try is moving your connection from whatever port on the switch it is on to another.  Sometimes a port on the switch just may be bad.\nYou will also want to verify the cable.  If you have access to another computer or a laptop, remove the patch cable from your iMac and plug it into the laptop.  If the problem persists, then you will need to solve that issue before doing more diagnostics on your iMac.  \nOnce you have verified that the connection from the switch to your iMac is good, then I would proceed with diagnosing the hardware, then the software on the iMac.  \n\nA: Open the Network Diagnostics app located in the /System/Library/CoreServices.\nThen Run it to check your Ethernet settings, and/or recommend solutions.\n\nTo be able to run the test, you need to have the Ethernet connection set up in your Network-Location screen. If it is not there set it up using the (+). Newer mind me calling it Comcast, you can choose the name for the Location.\n\nThen also try the different choice:\n\nAlso disable the WiFi then try the ethernet.\n\nA: Reinstalling OS X fixed the problem for me (using El Capitan).\n\nA: in Yosemite you can choose Network Diagnostics by clicking the WiFi icon in the menubar while holding the Alt(option) key. It is the third entry.\nIn Snow Leopard the Network Diagnostics is in the Utilities folder as far as I remember.\nLex\n", "Q: How do I save the photos I took on iPhone on my iPad? My photos come across through iCloud to my iPad.  I would like to keep them longer than a few months. I have plenty of storage, but the photos disappear. \n\nA: Presumably you are referring to My Photo Stream, which deletes photos after 30 days or 1000 images, which comes first. You don't say which version of iOS you are running, but the below will work on v8.\nYou can save photos to your device from My Photo Stream by tapping the Share icon (an upward pointing arrow) from any photo, then tapping Save Image.

Is there a way to fix this? and no i havent went over my data plan. It does work on wifi as well. \n\nA: First, go to Settings > General > About, and wait to see if the \"Update Carrier Settings?\" Dialogue box appears. \nThen, hard reset your phone by holding down the Home and Power button until you see the Apple logo. \nIf that doesn't resolve your connectivity issue:\nGo to Settings > General > Reset, and tap \"Reset Network Settings\". Enter your passcode if you have one set. \nTap \"Reset Network Settings\" again. This will cause your phone to restart, and you will lose all stored Wi-Fi passwords. \nHowever, it usually resolves problems like this. Back up your phone first if you aren't sure you remember all of your Wi-Fi passwords.\n\nA: First and foremost. Go into your settings and see if cellular data is disabled. Even if it's not disabled, try turning the feature off and then on again. This can sometimes work. \nBut if that doesn't work, make sure to backup all of the content on your iphone either to icloud through wifi or onto a computer with itunes installed. Then go into Settings>General>Reset and select \"Reset all settings\". This may take a few minutes, but when the reset is complete proceed to test your cellular data connection. (This should not erase all of your data, just reset your settings in the OS). \nIf this fails, go back to Settings>General>Reset and select \"Erase all content and settings\". this will take a bit longer to do and will erase everything so make sure that you have a proper backup. If this doesn't fix the problem, it is most likely not a software issue and you may want to contact your nearest Apple Store to see some of your options.\n", "Q: General Autocompletion Does anyone know of a good way to have autocompletion of custom items on a mac?  I know this is built into different programs, but what I would like would be independent of the program being used.  For example, if I need to type my email address somewhere I would like to be able to enter the first few letters and then have it completed for me.\n\nA: Basic autocompletion is built into macOS.

She will look up the home address attached to the \"me\" contact.\nYou can change which contact the \"me\" is attached to by going to Settings > General  > Siri > My Info and selecting a different contact.\nApparently this setting also can be changed here: Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars> My Info.\n\nA: settings>> mail, contacts, calendars>> scroll to contacts>> my info...

I have enabled the root user on my Mac so I can log into it and run Finder etc. Being the lazy person that I am, just transferred everything from my home directory to /var/root. I'm not too sure of doing this, so I may move everything back. Is it technically 'OK' to be using this like a normal user? (I am the only one who can access my computer.)\n\nA: In case the other reasons weren't good enough... Don't forget that you can't use Homebrew as root (which is actually a huge pain). Other programs also don't let you use them as root or run into permissions problems when you do, often times for no apparent reason, because their programmers assume that they won't be run as root. I think Steam is one of them.\nIt's also nice to have all the system and user stuff separate for various reasons.\nI don't know if it's that bad of a security issue. I'd personally be more worried about problems with organization and permissions than anything else.\n\nA: Just a few examples why it's not ok to always run as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Root user can easily place files in locations that are far more difficult to track down.\n\n*Root user has raw access to interfaces and so can put an interface into promiscuous or monitor mode and log ALL network traffic.\n\n*Root user has raw access to device nodes and can thrash a disk making it far harder to recover files than a simple 'rm' at user level. Root user can also potentially modify boot sectors of a drive, making malware persistent even after a reinstall of the operating system.\n\n\nI could go on. The point is that there ARE good reasons not to run as root. I don't disagree that to most people their most personal data is in their home directory anyhow, but running as root still does put that data, and the entire system, at a greater risk. The advice to not run as root is not misplaced. If a person does not understand the implications of running as root, they definitely should not be doing so. Suggesting anything else is irresponsible.\n\nA: Using your computer logged in as root all the time is like always carrying around all your keys, your passport, $5,000 in cash, that piece of paper with all your passwords written on it and the only photo you have of Flopsy, the adorable rabbit whose death broke your seven-year-old heart. Oh, and a chainsaw.\nWhich is to say, it's mighty convenient from time to time, because it means you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, without needing to go back home to get stuff or talk to your bank manager. But it also puts you at great risk of losing stuff, having it stolen (don't think that chainsaw will help you: you'll be streets away before you notice your wallet's gone), doing things you really regret later (impulse-buying plane tickets to Vegas while drunk), taking dangerous shortcuts (chainsawing through the lion enclosure fence because that's the fastest way to the pandas) and over-reacting (chainsawing your neighbour's car because his dog barks too much). And, when you think about it, mostly, you're just going to the office, going grocery shopping, hanging out with your friends. You don't need all that stuff with you all the time just for the convenience of needing it, what?, once a month? Once a week?\nSo, no, it's not OK to use the root account all the time. It gives you a tiny amount of convenience but puts you in a lot of danger. There's the danger of stupid mistakes having catastrophic results (\"Hey, why is rm -rf * taking so long to run? **** I'm in /!\"). There's the danger of acclimating yourself to the idea that all files are equal and you can just mess about with whatever you want, anywhere in the directory tree. There's the danger that any hack to your account is immediately a hack to the whole system, so now every single piece of software on your machine is security-critical. And even if you think you don't care about your machine getting hacked (after all, that photo of Flopsy is a real piece of glossy paper, not some ephemeral JPEG), I care about your machine getting hacked because then it's on the botnet that's mounting the DDOS attack against whatever internet service I can't access today.\nRoot is your spiderman costume. It gives you great power but requires great responsibility. It's there in the closet whenever you need it, so you don't have to wear it all the time.\n\nA: You can, but it's a major security and stability risk. Doing so allows any application full access to your computer. You can't know what they're doing with that access. It's unnecessary, and just really unsafe.\nFor a lot more background information on this, see\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it bad to login as root\n\n*Why not run always logged in as root\n\n*Why it is not recommend to use root login in linux\n\nA: Honestly, I agree that there are a lot of risks associated with using the root user as default. But let me just run through them and criticize some of the arguments a bit\n\n\n*\n\n*Defending against applications: Practically the permission system of *nix is not strong enough (by far) to allow running arbitrary programs. A malicious program on *nix is able to do enough evil stuff (like stealing your bank credentials) without root permissions. It will be somewhat harder for a non-root application than for a root application (e.g. instead of directly installing a root-certificate and intercepting the connection to the bank you will need to mess around with the browser instead, but hey, that's actually quite doable and you likely had to do that anyways to make sure the user doesn't notice anything) \n\n*Defending against user mistakes (like running a wrong command and deleting all system files): Absolutely true, but even though a non-root user will save the system, all the important files will normally be lost already (as the user owned files are far more likely to be unique). \n\n*Defending against exploitable bugs in applications you run: Now this is more like it. E.g. when you run a web server where a lot of applications are open to the outside and thus any exploitable bugs will be easily reached. The same still applies of course even if you are sitting behind a router and firewall, though the extent of the danger is far less significant. Once again however the question becomes how much the permission system will realistically defend on a private system. Without root permissions all private files can still be accessed and intercepting network data is also possible... the two most important things you can wish for as an attacker of a private system.\n\n\n*\n\n*(Now, on top of the standard *nix file permission system Apple has also introduced an application sandboxing system. As far as I know that one is still fully functional even when logged in as root. If however it weren't then that would be a total deal breaker.)\n\n\n\nEither way, all considered I do not think it's as terrible an idea as some others claim. Mind you, I am not saying it's a good idea either, but I think that people overestimate the usefulness of the *nix file system permission model in protecting you. Yes, it's incredibly useful for certain things (e.g. multi user systems, complex multi-application servers, keeping the system running no matter what happens (running, but not necessary usable), locking important files away (though you're better off encrypting those...), etc.), but it's not some magical protection that prevents bad stuff from happening.\nIn the comments I came up with an analogy which seems quite adequate in describing the situation. In Dutch we have a word for the little closet where you can find all the meters and the toggle for the main water supply, etc. Running as the root user account is like taking the lock off that little closet. Ironic fact: Most people don't have locks on it in the first place. Now, just like with the root user that's not to say that it's not useful to lock it away in certain cases, for example in offices or other semi-public buildings it's often locked away, but in normal houses it's far more important to have a strong lock on the front door (not installing random things, firewall, etc.) and putting all your important stuff in a safe (making backups, encrypting stuff, etc.). Will an extra lock on that closet hurt? Nope, so it might be a good idea to have it in place just in case, but in all likelihood it's going to be quite useless.\nRunning as the root user is nothing like taking all the locks of your house and carrying all the stuff in the safe with you all the time as is claimed by David Richerby. Your passport (identity) is in no way protected by the *nix file system, your money (bank account) is in no way protected by the *nix file system, your important passwords are likely not protected by the *nix file system (if you're using Safari however they might actually protected partially by the *nix file system permission model, but without root you can still add an invisible extension to Safari and next just intercept the password the next time you use it), your photos are definitely not protected by the *nix file system and if you're using the terminal you're already carrying a chainsaw around with you (per point 2 above).\n\nA: Back around 1990 I was working on a project with a guy named Tom. We were using a SUN server running SunOS (a Unix derivative, predecessor to Solaris). This was back in the days before CD drives and flash drives, so if you messed up the OS on your hard drive there was no way to recover.\nTom used to routinely log in as root. I told him that was a bad idea, but he did not listen. One day I heard him say \"Uh-oh\". He had meant to type comething like this:\nmv something* .\n\nUnfortunately he left off the final dot, so the shell expanded all the file and directory names which matched this pattern. Then the mv command used whatever ended up as the final name in the list as the destination directory, and moved everything else into it. Also unfortunately, he was currently at the root directory, so basically the entire file system got moved into one of its subdirectories. \nI used up-arrow to bring back the previous command and saw what had happened.\nThe first thing I then said was, \"Don't log off! Or you will never be able to log in again.\"\nNo problem, right? We could just move everything back. We could, except that the mv command was not one of the built-in commands of the shell. Instead, it was an executable program, stored in one of the files which had been moved. Luckily, ls was a built-in command, so after using ls to confirm where the commands had moved to, I was able to find the mv command, invoke it with its full path name, and put things back where they were supposed to be.\nAnd then I told him, \"Tom, this is why it is a bad idea to routinely log in as root.\"\n\nA: Generally you want to keep ownership of your personal files separate from the root user. This is why you create a account for yourself as an administrator.  The accepted way, under OS X, to gain root level access is to use the sudo command from the Terminal application. For example, if you want to see the partitioning of your internal drive the command is\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nwhich if entered will result in the following error message.\ngpt show: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Permission denied\n\nTo use the command, you need to use sudo as shown below.\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nIf you want to become the root user to avoid entering sudo, you can just enter sudo sh. The exit command can be used to exit from being the root user.\nIf you want to execute an application as the root user, you can by using the Terminal application. For example, if you want to launch the Finder as the root user, enter the following command.\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder &\n\nTo avoid the confusion of having two Finder applications open at the same time, it is usually best to quit your Finder application first. This can be done using the following terminal command.\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to quit'\n\nOne word of caution: preceding a command with sudo is not the same as becoming the root user. For example, the commands  \nsudo echo $USER\nsudo echo $SUDO_USER\n\nresult in the same output as the commands shown below.\necho $USER\necho $SUDO_USER\n\nIf you become the root user (the superuser), then the same commands result in a different output. This can be verified by entering the commands shown below.\nsudo sh\necho $USER\necho $SUDO_USER\nsudo echo $USER\nsudo echo $SUDO_USER\nexit\n\n\nA: Unless you're using backtrack/kali for a specific task: NO.\nTreat the super user as you would a loaded gun: if you have an immediate need and intention to use it: OK. If you can solve your problem in any other manner, however (e.g. \"sudo\"), do that.\n\nA: NO! This will get your system broken into in a very short amount of time. Instead, su or sudo into root as necessary. If you absolutely, positively, must run as root, at least log out at any time when you're not using the computer. If your system is capable of running multiuser, but no users are configured, I suggest you create a privileged user (i.e: one that can sudo/su into root as necessary.) ASAP!!!\n\nA: Simply use SUDO\nMy guess is the OP does not know how easy it is to use sudo on the occasions you need to use root.\nOP, all your problems are over. Immediately restore your Mac to a normal state.\nAnd just use sudo as needed.  Phew.\n", "Q: What is the worst thing that will happen if I do not update iTunes to its latest version? Okay, I like iTunes, and it is a wonderful software. I run it on Windows, unfortunately sometimes when I do update to minor version updates, the whole windows panel of iTunes becomes unresponsive and behave oddly. So I have decided to not update for couple of months. Is it wise, or will it have any security loophole in my computer.\n\nA: The only way to know this is to watch the release notes for every subsequent version of iTunes and see if the release has any security content.\nThis will change over time, but the present version of iTunes for Windows is 12.1.2, for which the release notes can be found here: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1614.\nYou will note that security is not mentioned for this release, but you do need to be aware of future releases so that you can check their notes when they come out to see if any flaws have arose.\nYou may find it easier instead to just follow some Mac news blogs, since they typically all run stories when an update is released.\nOverall, however, I wouldn't say this is a tremendous security risk.\n", "Q: Can you sync an iPhone to the new MacBooks wirelessly?

That actually is a USB port, it just uses a USB type-C connector, which is not what your iPhone cord has.\nYou will need to buy the USB to USB-C adapter. Virtually 100% of USB devices sold today use the connector before type-C, the one that has been standard for nearly two decades (like the one on your iPhone cord), and so buying the adapter will likely become necessary at some point regardless of your iPhone's need for it.\nOnce you plug the iPhone into the MacBook for the first time, you can modify the settings so you can sync wirelessly with iTunes in the future - see Tetsujin's answer for instructions.\n\nA: From comments - you may need to borrow an adapter to initialise the trust between iPhone & Mac, physically [see if a Genius bar will let you borrow one of theirs for 5 mins; they'll probably help you do it, too]\nafter that it will work as below...\nYou can sync & backup your iPhone to iTunes, so long as they are both on the same WiFi network.\nIt will run automatically when the phone is plugged into a charger, or manually at any time by selecting the device, then clicking the Sync button in iTunes.\nYou can also manually run Backups the same way.\nI use these settings so that I get sync to iCloud & iTunes automatically…\nBackups go automatically to iCloud & manually to the Mac.\n\nNote both Sync & Backup buttons are active, even though the phone is not currently connected over USB.\n\nA: if you wanna sync your pictures and videos just log in to your iCloud from MacBook and retrieve them !\nnow USB cable is necessary for backing up and restore your iPhone .\n", "Q: Safari on iOS crashes whenever I try to type anything into the search field I’m running iOS 8.3 (12F70) on an iPhone 5S.

These two stood out to me:\n\nTitle                 URL                      Visits  Last Visited\nCannot Open Page      <long Facebook url>      -7      14 Aug 2015, 17:16\nCannot Open Page      <long Facebook url>      1       14 Aug 2015, 17:12\nThe Facebook URL is an authentication page that was apparently launched by an iOS game. I don’t understand how it can be last visited in the future (that date is nearly two months after the problem started) or have negative visits.\nI’m genuinely mystified as to how that item entered my history – I barely play the game in question, and I’ve never messed about with the date/time settings on my phone. And I have no idea how you get negative visits – possibly some sort of overflow somewhere?\nI think it’s likely that this item was the culprit, but how and why are total mysteries.\n\nA: I started having this issue tonight and immediately cleared my website data, restarted iPhone, and killed safari from the home screen with no luck.\nI finally turned off the search engine suggestions, Safari suggestions, and preload top hit and that seemed to fix it. \nI am, by no means, a tech guru so I have absolutely no explanation for why this happened or why turning those things off fixed it. Good luck to everyone else!\n\nA: Narrowed it down to Safari Suggestions. I shut suggestions off and it works fine now.\n\nA: On iOS 8.4.1 on an iPad gen 3, turning off \"Spotlight Suggestions\" in Safari settings resolved the issue.\nI also cleared all history but that had no impact until I disabled Spotlight.\n\nA: This happened to me on iOS 9.2 (mini iPad)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to 'Settings', turn off 'Safari Suggestions'\n\n*Turn on 'Private Browsing'\n\n\nBoth of these worked for me.\n\nA: Turn off Search Engine Suggestions and Preload Top Hit. I can confirm normal Safari is working fine now.\nMy iPad Retina was just doing the same thing. It worked fine an hour ago and then Safari started crashing and closing. It's worth mentioning that Private \nBrowsing was unaffected and worked fine.\nI tried deleting history but it made no difference.\n", "Q: Safari Bookmarklet - accessing DOM I've tried following bookmarklets:\n\njavascript:document.body.style.width='50%';\n\nor\n\njavascript:document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].width='50%';\n\nThey both work in console, but not in bookmarklet. What is the reason?\nThey both work fine as Chrome's bookmarklets.\nAlso, this bookmarklet works fine (on HTML5 videos):\n\njavascript:document.getElementsByTagName(\"video\")[0].playbackRate=2.5\n\n\nA: Safari requires that a literal percent sign in a URL (%) be URL-encoded in a bookmarklet (%25...while it looks like that's just 25 added, the percent sign followed by two numbers is decoded to a literal percent sign). Also, the property is .style.width, not just .width.\nChange your bookmarklet to this:\njavascript:document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0].style.width='50%25';\n\nI've confirmed this works in Safari v8.0.6 (OS X 10.10.3).\n", "Q: How to upgrade Mac Pro firmware? So I'm buying a used Mac Pro 1.1 next month. It has an original dual Intel Xenon dual-core CPUs, and I'm aiming to upgrade it to Intel Xenon X5355s and I already bought them.\nI've read a lot about it online and some people say that they needed to upgrade the firmware. Youtube upgrade demonstrations were helpful though.\nMy question is - how can I tell if Mac Pro needs a firmware upgrade, and if it does, how is it upgraded?\nAlso, is firmware same thing as BIOS in PCs?\nSorry if this has been asked before, but most topics address these terms as something common, but I've never used a Mac before. An in-depth explanation would be great.\n\nA: Automatically Through Software Update\nIt is likely that OS X will automatically prompt you to download and install any recommended firmware update. This happens as part of OS X's software update process.\nSee About firmware updates for Intel-based Macs for the specific update steps on older Macs:\n\nLearn how to locate, download, and apply a firmware update to an Intel-based Mac computer.\n\nAll about the Mac Pro,1.1.\nManually via the Apple Support Site\nAlternatively, you can find firmware updates on the Apple Support site. For example, this update appeared soon after the Mac Pro1.1 was released in 2006: Mac Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.1:\n\nThe SMC Firmware Update adjusts fan behavior in the Mac Pro.\n\nDownload and run the updater. The updater will check and prompt you if it is required.\nThese firmware updates are effectively the same as a PC BIOS. As a Mac user, there is nothing to manage or update at the BIOS level; it is controlled by Apple.\n\nA: Well, this is where you go to find the current firmware for all iMac's: EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Macs.\nIn the case of the MacPro1,1, the two updates would be:\nMac Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.2\nMac Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.1\n", "Q: How do I repartition my Mac to get rid of my dual boot setup?

This is not the same a core storage on disk0. Even though klanomath's answer seems more complex than mine, he does have far more experience with core storage than I have. I would not hesitate to use his answer over mine. \nThe EFI partition (disk0s1) existed before you installed Ubuntu. The installation of Ubuntu probably added the GRUB boot loader to this partition. You could mount this partition (using the Disk Utility application) and delete EFI/ubuntu folder containing these files, but it would be easier to just leave them where they are.\nTo remove Ubuntu, you do need to delete disk0s4 and disk0s5. You should be able to do this from the Disk Utility application. Remove disk0s4 first, followed by disk0s5. Both operations may take quite a long time to complete. Be patient.\n\nA: Basically you have to delete the linux partitions (disk0s4 and disk0s5) and then expand your CoreStorage volume (Macintosh HD) to the full size.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing altcmdR while booting\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar -> Utilities\n\n*enter diskutil list and diskutil cs list to get the partition and the CoreStorage listing.\n\n*Now unmount all disks except the OS X Base System (~1.3 GB) and its accompanying volumes (eleven really small sized volumes). First the CoreStorage disk (probably disk2, check the size: ~149.1 GB!) and then the physical disk:\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk2\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Enter gpt -r show /dev/disk0 to get the partition table\n\n*Remove the two linux partitions (choose the proper index numbers of the two linux partitions):  \ngpt remove -i 5 /dev/disk0\ngpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0\n\nIf the deletion of the Linux swap volume fails try to reformat it with diskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ Blank /dev/disk0s4 and continue with step 4.\n\n*Reenter gpt -r show /dev/disk0 to check if all Linux partitions are deleted\n\n*Remount any previously unmounted volume in the reverse order with\ndiskutil mountdisk /dev/disk0\ndiskutil mount LVUUID #LVUUID=UUID of the logical volume found previously\n\n\n*Enter diskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size \nwith LVUUID: UUID of the logical volume (usually the last UUID found in the diskutil cs list listing you got previously) and size: the final size of your CoreStorage volume.\nExample:\ndiskutil cs resizeStack 2AB8ABA4-9A16-48C2-A085-D3FE3251E41F 0g \n\nto expand it to the full available size (0g is a magic number here).\n\n*Finally you might delete the GRUB loader if it was installed on disk0s1.\n\n", "Q: How do you position your hand to press Command (cmd) + Option (alt) keys? Combination Cmd+Opt+some key is pretty common in OS X. For example \"cut\": Cmd+C Cmd+Opt+V. \nI'm struggling to press it with one hand. It's hard. Things goes insane if combination also includes Shift (\"Save for Web\" in Photoshop - Cmd+Opt+Shift+S). \nIt is easier to press \"equivalent\" Ctrl + Alt on Windows which placed like Ctrl+Command on Mac.\nFirst of all I was trying to avoid Cmd+Opt in any sofware I used. But it looks like, it's the \"OS X way\" and there always be the software containing shortcuts with this combination.\nHow do live with this? How to make it less painful?\n\nA: I am also suffering the same issue. I think logically and ergonomically these Apple keys really suck.\nWhat I do is that I have to use my both hands. I leave my right hand from mouse and Press cmd key with my right hand and other combination keys from the left hand\n\nA: It is possible to set Option key to Caps lock (nobody really use it) in System preferences. Caps lock placed more useful. \nBut often people rebind Control to Caps lock, so you have to decide which one is more important to you.  \n\nA: I know it is an old thread.

How many users can be connected to an iPhone's personal hotspot? Does the limit differ from device to device? I want to know the limit of maximum users.\n\nA: Quoting from an Apple support article about Personal Hotspot (emphasis mine):\n\nWhen you connect a device to your Personal Hotspot, the status bar turns blue and shows how many devices have joined. The number of devices that can join your Personal Hotspot at one time depends on your carrier and iPhone model.\n\nI believe the typical limit is usually between 3 to 5 devices.\n\nA: You can have up to 21 people join I have had that many people and I have 5s \n", "Q: MacBook Air boots to strange screen showing Magic Mouse and TrackPad Problem :\nI left the MacBook to be idle for a while and its keyboard and trackpad became non-responsive.

However, the issue is till not resolved. \n\nA: Since the MacBook Air has a mouse and keyboard connected, something went really wrong with the hardware. You could reset the NVRAM and SMC, but it likely needs hardware diagnostics. \n\n\n*\n\n*You might be lucky if you can connect a USB mouse and see if at least the cursor works.\n\n*Also, boot holding Command R to enter recovery mode. \n\n\nIt's a long shot that the above things will get you further, but they are quick and easy to try before you use https://locate.apple.com to find a service tech or call AppleCare for further diagnostics.\n\nA: The graphics are telling you to turn on the Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad associated with the MacBook. Have you ever connected one of these devices to it? \nIf you haven't, I have to wonder if the internal keyboard and trackpad are not connected somehow. What year is this MacBook? Is it still under warranty?\nUnless you can boot to recovery and reinstall OS X, your best bet is likely taking it to an Apple Store. If it's a hardware problem, it is better to let them deal with it. \nEDIT: Now that I think about it, both pictures are pointing devices, and you say the trackpad doesn't work. Do you have a USB mouse you could try plugging in? It may be that the trackpad is broken, so OS X is asking you to provide a pointing device. \n", "Q: How much faster is an external SSD than external HDD if internal drive is SSD? I'm running intensive animation software and am having speed issues.\nAt the moment I'm just working from an internal SSD.\nHow much faster should it run if I put the project files on an external HDD?\nHow much faster should an external SSD be than an external HDD?\nIs it worth investing in external SSDs in this situation?\nMy computer is a 2011 MacBook Pro running on Mavericks - 8GB memory and Samsung 840 EVO 750GB 2.5-inch Basic SATA Solid State Drive with AMD Radeon HD 6750M 1024 MB graphics.

A long time ago, there was an iOS app that was quite innovative for the time. The way it worked was that two iDevices on the same Wi-Fi network that wanted to share data (for instance a picture) would launch this app and come to a virtual \"table\". The edge of the table would be a recipient. To send the picture, the sender would choose what to share and bring it to the table, and then swipe the picture off a particular edge of the screen, and it would slide in on the recipient's device. As far as I can recall, the UI was white.\nCan anyone name this app?\n\nA: Mover\n\nPut something — a contact, a photo, a video, a file — on the Mover table, connect two iOS or Mac OS X thingies to the same Wi-Fi network and slide away. It's that simple, really.\n  (Yep, you can also use Bluetooth between iPhones, iPod touches and iPads, if you're on the go!)\n\n∞labs, the developer of Mover, shut down a while ago and the app is no longer available.\n", "Q: Managing Photos Library I have a new-ish Macbook Air with limited HD space. I take a lot of photos as a wannabe photographer. Even if I had more HD space, eventually I'd run out of space. I have and use Photostream, but I'm curious how other people manage their disk usage without losing images all together. Here's my usual process with photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a crapton of photos w/ my DSLR.\n\n*Import those photos into iPhoto (now Photos, of course) on my computer.\n\n*Delete an embarrassingly high percentage of those photos.\n\n*Edit the rest as needed.\n\n*Organize them as desired.\n\n*Share all of them via iCloud Photo Sharing.\n\n*Share the ones I find particularly interesting or likable on Flickr.\n\n\nThis is all well and good, but about every 6 months or so I hit my (self-imposed) 64GB photo limit and now what? To date, my solution has been to archive that library to a MicroSD card and create a new library to start over again.\nIt's the last part that I just hate. I have to rebuild common folders/albums, smart albums and anything else that is not specific to any one 6 month period every time I start over.\nPlease tell me there's a better way.\n\nA: You could upgrade your iCloud storage and utilize the iCloud Photo Library, this can be used/setup by checking the respective box in Preferences.\nThe other option would be to have your Photos library on an external hard drive. Then when launching Photos, hold the option key, choose other library on the bottom left, and you can point Photos to look at the external drive's Photos library. This will only display your library when your external drive is connected however.\n\nA: I manage it by not self-imposing a (IMO pretty ridiculously low) size limit on how much space they take up. Storage is cheap - well, as cheap as it's ever been, anyway, even if not \"cheap\" as in $1 McChickens cheap.\nBuy a decent 4 TB external hard drive and save photos nearly forever. At 64 GB per 6 months, you're looking at over a quarter of a century (even allowing for Photos library overhead) before you run out of space.\nAlso note Photo Stream is in no way a long-term storage solution. iCloud Photo Library, on the other hand, could be, but at your usage rate, you'd end up paying $20 a month pretty quick just for storage.\n", "Q: Install Monokai Theme on Terminal with prompt colors, etc.? I already have a Monokai theme installed in Terminal, as so:\n\nI was wondering how I could get the rest of the Monokai (as Sublime uses) into Terminal? Like, making the prompt (Gamma@~) colored, etc.\nHere is my current .bash_profile file:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nexport CLICOLOR=1\nexport LSCOLORS=gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx\nexport PS1=\"\\u@\\w $ \"\nalias ls='ls -G'\n\nThank you very much! I know this question is rather vague, but I cannot seem to find a PS1 color scheme that matches Monokai.\n\nA: See this answer on the Unix & Linux SE. There are a number of additional colors that can be used in a 256 color terminal.\nYou can view the colors in Terminal, and see their codes, by running this bash script. (There is a also a color chart in the above linked post, or IMO a more readable chart here.)\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncolor=16;\n\nwhile [ $color -lt 245 ]; do\n    echo -e \"$color: \\\\033[38;5;${color}mhello\\\\033[48;5;${color}mworld\\\\033[0m\"\n    ((color++));\ndone\n\nOnce you determine the colors you want, and have the color codes, you can use them in a PS1 prompt like shown below.\n48;5;# where # is the color number you want, sets the background color.\n38;5;# again # replaced with the color number, sets the foreground color.\nIn my case I wanted the default background that Terminal set when it was launched, and I use 0 to note this.

It comes with several additional features on top of Terminal, and you can download and install a whole bunch of sweet themes on top of it. Apart from iTerm, I can also recommend zsh, which is just an additional layer on top of the bash shell, and if you use the oh-my-zsh plugin, again, you get a whole bunch of pre-cooked themes and prompts.\n", "Q: Web and outbound ssh stopped working but ping and other network services work Our home iMac running 10.6 suddenly stopped loading web pages.

panic related to the the IONetworking drivers.\nPotential solutions:\nDelete the sleepimage file found in the \n/var/vm/\n\nFolder\nDelete the contents

Xxx's iMac\nI believe this will take care of your issue.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Ethernet Bridge; Very slow outbound packets to LAN and Internet My 2012-era MacBook Air is connected to a 2012-era iMac via a Thunderbolt cable. The iMac contains a Thunderbolt-Ethernet bridge which in theory should allow the MBA to (1) participate in extremely fast file transfers with the iMac and (2) access the Internet and LAN without the use of additional ethernet cabling or WiFi.\nBoth operations work as expected, but with a catch: Sending TCP/IP traffic from the MBA to any computers on the LAN other than the iMac, or to any computers on the Internet, is incredibly slow. Receiving traffic works just fine. Sending a file from a server on the LAN to the MBA, for example, is very fast, and downstream speed tests initiated on the MBA via SpeedTest.net max out my Internet connection at 60Mbps. But all traffic originating from the MBA in the upstream direction is ridiculously slow; Traffic from the MBA to machines on the LAN or the Internet moves at around .08Mbps. A test via SpeedTest.net confirms. (Traffic between the MBA and iMac is very fast in both directions.)\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Have you looked carefully at Firewall permissions on both computers? You may be blocking outbound connections from the MacBook Air on the iMac.\nIf you are protected behind a router, I'd try these tests again with all Firewall and networking limitations turned off. I'd also try turning off Little Snitch if I had it installed, while running these tests.\nApart from the lightning fast file transfers (SSD speeds I imagine), between MacBook Air and iMac, you could try adding a local 1000 BaseT switch and plug both machines into that switch via ethernet. For the MacBook Air, you'd either need a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter which you have for something like 1000 BaseT speeds or if you are willing to live with 100 BaseT speeds the simple Apple USB Ethernet Adapter.\n\nYou could also try plugging the iMac directly into ethernet so you are not crossing ethernet to Thunderbolt with Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt as Apple Network Sharing works less reliably between two identical protocols (Thunderbolt-Thunderbolt) than two different ones (wifi-ethernet, Thunderbolt-ethernet).\nPlease let me know how you get on with your network sharing issue.\n", "Q: Macbook pro late 2011 can support 16GB 1600Mhz RAM I want to upgrade my MacBook Pro to 16GB 1600Mhz of RAM.

I want to use qemu-kvm within the Linux VM (yes, I know it's not efficient).\nQEMU reports the following problem:\nCould not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory\nfailed to initialize KVM: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Stop the virtual machine and open its settings. Under the \"Processors & Memory\" pane, expand the \"Advanced options\" section. Check \"Enable hypervisor applications in this virtual machine.\"\nYou can also manually edit the VM's .vmx file. For example, if your VM is named \"Ubuntu\", edit Ubuntu.vmwarevm/Ubuntu.vmx (to get into the .vmwarevm in Finder, select Show Package Contents).\nWithin the .vmx file, add the following line:\nvhv.enable = \"TRUE\"\n\nAfter doing either of the above, restart the VM and you can use KVM.\n", "Q: Mail: Select SMTP server automatically on addressee I have two SMTP servers configured in Mail. One for school, and one for my private email. I would like that Mail automatically picks the one for school if I'm sending an email to someone of my school. This means: any email address of someone of my university ends in @ugent.be. So if I write an email to xyz@ugent.be, I want mail to pick my UGent SMTP server. In all other cases, I want to use my gmail SMTP server configuration.\nIs this possible? If not, are there any applications that support this feature?\n(Some people on the university are very strict and won't reply unless you sent the email from your university email address. And I like it separated nicely as well.)\n\nA: The automatic domain selection in Mail based on the address is not possible but....\nThere is a setting in Mail, send from the account of the selected mail box. \n\nMeans, if you create or reply to emails while in the Mailbox of the University it will use that account. \nHowever, if you create reply from your other account it will use that one. \nSo all you have to do with your 2 accounts is to make sure to use the right account when creating or replying.\nAdditionally you can use the \"Mark addresses not ending with ....@ugent.be\nShow email addresses that don’t end in a specified domain in red, to help prevent you from sending messages to unintended recipients.\n", "Q: Prevent dock stacking First of all, I'm quite new to mac so sorry if this question is too obvious. I'm coming straight from Arch Linux, so this is still a bit confusing for me ;-)\nI have problems with the dock. It seem to group windows but always shows the most on top icon. Is there a way I can have mac simply show all available windows?\nI.e I have the Mail Application open, and it seems there are 3 windows: 1 Message composition, one detailed view of a message and 1 message overview window. I seem to be able to see them only if I swipe up with 3 fingers and then I get a overview where the 3 ones are on top of each other with every one overlapping a little bit. Also with cmd-tab I can just open to most recent window.\nWhat is the standard way to navigate between these windows?\n\nA: You can use  Cmd ⌘   `   (the key under escape) to switch between the windows of an application.\n", "Q: How to open applications regardless of required version? So I downloaded this application that I am relatively sure is able to run fine on 10.7.5 (My version of OSX), but when I try to open it, a message pops up saying that it requires at least version 10.8.5. The reason I think it should work with my OS is because an older version of the app does, and as far as I can tell, there is no real content added between that update and this one, so I don't feel they could have refactored it so much in a somewhat insignificant update that it no longer works on my OS. (And this application really doesn't let you downgrade, so done say I should do that) It doesn't open and then crash. When I try to open it, just a window with the Finder icon pops up saying that it doesn't work on the current version of my OS, and I need 10.8.5. The application doesn't even try to open. So I feel that there must be a flag somewhere in the code or something dictating minimum version required. So my question is: Is there a way to ignore this flag and open this application regardless of minimum required version?\n\nA: That check is done by checking the application's plist.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the application and click \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Open \"Contents\"\n\n*Open \"Info.plist\"\n\n*Scroll down to where it says \"LSMinimumSystemVersion\" or \"Minimum system version\" depending on the editor you're using.\n\n*Replace the string on the next line which should be \"10.8.5\" (or to the right of the key, again, depending on the editor) with \"10.7.5\". Try to open the app again.\nYou may have to restart after this change.\n\nA: I'm on macOS 10.14 trying to run a program meant for 10.15, but the \"Info.plist\" file didn't contain any reference to a minimum system version. However, I was able to launch the application by navigating to the /Contents/MacOS directory inside the package contents, right clicking the executable found there, and selecting \"Open\".\n", "Q: How do you get a list of all your Game Center accounts? I need to know what the original account was for my Clash of Clans is so I may transfer to another device. Any suggestions? I have tried multiple times trying to find through my emails with no luck. Can Game Center email a list of my CoC account?\n\nA: The Gamecenter tokens are saved in your keychain.\nOpen it in search for it (Game). It will list all accounts you have.\ncom.apple.account.AppleID.appleid-token-gamecenter\n\n\n", "Q: 'Mail can't connect to the account' keeps appearing So I've configured my mail using a profile. I have setup 3 mail accounts, but each time I launch Mail, it asks me for the passwords of all those accounts. The first time I thought: maybe that's a bug in Mail when mail accounts are configured using profiles. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case: it prompts me to enter the password for all 3 accounts, and it doesn't stop. When I enter it, it just asks me for the passwords of the other accounts, and then it asks for the first one again, etc., etc.\nWhen I go to the Preferences, I can see that the passwords are indeed not entered. It can only connect to one(!) SMTP server (that's what Connection Doctor says).\nWhat is causing this and how can it be solved?\n\nA: The quickest way to run through the potential problems is to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the keychain to find any entries that match your email accounts, then delete all of them. Reboot.\n\n*Try to connect again, entering your passwords again.  Check email again and see if the error reoccurs.\n\n*If the error happens again, delete your email accounts using the system preferences, reboot, and then add them back. Check email again. \n\n\nIf the error continues to occur after doing all that, you might think about taking your Mac into the Apple genius bar.\n\nA: Your Mail accounts are saved in your keychain.\nTake a look if they are there (with password ect..), you might see multiple entry (2) for each account. One is for sending (IMAP) one is for receiving (SMTP)\nIf you have problems try restoring the Disk permissions in the Disk utility.\n\nA: Check that everything is typed in correctly. In my case, my employer reset my account and somehow a space got inserted into the email address before the '@'. It was impossible to see on the accounts pop-up, but when I checked the keychain it appeared as a full tab - e.g. \"name.name      @employer.com\". \nDeleting the passwords in keychain and removing the space worked.

Recently when I upgraded to Yosemite I noticed that NTFS read/write access was not present as is, so I decided to use the opportunity to try out the trial version of Paragon NTFS 12 (latest). \nI uninstalled both OSXFuse and MacFuse but noticed that Paragon does not even recognize either of my NTFS drives in both the Finder and in the System Preferences section. I've tried disabling/enabling, uninstalling/re-installing to not avail. I even experienced the same when I tried the trial version of Tuxera.\nWhat might be the issue here? Is some remnant from the earlier NTFS-3G installation causing this issue?\n\nA: Here's the only thing that worked for me, w/ 3 Seagate & 1toshiba w/ Paragon NTFS dominant over all till 10.10.3, - no access at all. Uninstall Incl** all plist files, you may need to look past your user folder library. Shutdown and disconnect pwr / & HDD's for 5 min.

The only issue is not it is the hot weather my 2015 MBP is now making me feel hot (due to feeling the heat on my lap).\nTo fix this issue I would like to use an application such as SmcFanControl. Is this updated for the retina 2015 MBP and will I be able to set my fans back to auto when I don't need the application any more?\nThanks\n\nA: I think it is safe to use, since the latest update has a reset function:\n\nNew: Reset-Feature to reset fans back to factory defaults, delete settings and favorites \n\nI've also red somewhere they fixed SmcFanControl on newer macs.\n\nA: If you have a MacBook and not a MacBook Pro you don't have to use SmcFanControl, but if you have a Pro it is safe to use smcFanControl. I'm using this utility to cool down my MacBook Pro 2010 when the days are hot, and everything works just fine. You can choose a bottom level for coolers' rmp and if the system needs more rmp the smcFanControl won't stop the coolers from increasing the rpm.\nHope I was helpful.\n\nA: I often need to fire up the fans on various Mac laptops for testing, and decided to find something more up to date quite recently.\nI now use iStat Menus, which in addition to temperature readouts, which are rather useful in this context, it shows the current speed of the fan(s) and allows you to select from three presets to ramp them up. You can also adjust them using a slider, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nA: Once you change the fan settings in SMC, you then need to close the software and re-open it before the changes take effect.  Not sure why it does this, but it works for me.\n\nA: Just found out SmcFanControl doesn't work. I tried changing settings and my fans haven't came on at all.\n\nA: There are several other settings that can be modified in order to stop some of the race conditions that can afflict Macs. For example, see this article, though it deals with a MacBook Air, the same principles apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX Approach to Cooling\nAnd yes, to your orginal question, smcFanControl works well and should not harm your computer, and indeed as it allows a lower fan speed setting, it could conceivably have less wear and tear on the hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*smcFanControl on Github\n", "Q: MacBook Pro HDD won't show in Windows I've got to send my MBP in for the infamous GPU problem (2011-2013 models) and I would like to back up or at least gain access to my HDD to save some important-ish files.\nI've hooked the drive up to my PC, but only the Windows 7 partition shows in My Computer.\nWhen I go to Disk Management, the whole drive shows up as seen in this picture:\n\nI've got HFSExplorer and that doesn't seem to help. Any ways I can go about gaining access?\n\nA: Yosemite converts your drive to Core Storage, which makes most Windows utilities that used to be able to read Mac drives, unable to do so. I'd suggest making an image of the drive. I'm not terribly familiar with Windows disk imaging software, but it looks like DAEMON Tools will get the job done.

It also annoys me, because every time I connect a new device to my Mac, I have to disable \"Open Photos App when connected to this device\" for that device. It also uses a spot from in my Launchpad.\nIs there any way to disable/hide the new Photos App in Yosemite from the launchpad and disable it from starting up if any new device connects?\nI don't want to delete it.\n\nA: You can try running this command from Terminal:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool YES\nTo re-enable it again, type:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool NO\nJust a warning that I don't have access to a Yosemite machine to verify this.\n", "Q: Way to manually(!) sort files into folders I'm looking for an easy way to quickly go through a bunch of files, mostly videos and images and sort them in a set of standard folders.\nCurrently I open the videos/images in VLC see what they're about and drag/drop 'em into folders. This is incredibly tedious work, but I really should get it done already. Annoying bits are in large part due to the dragging and dropping, also because the alphabetical sort order in the Finder and VLC is different and the file names get replaced by video titles in the VLC playlist etc.\nIdeally I would want an application that show me the content (ideally skipping x% into the video to skip intros etc) and lets me sort it with a single key (press 1 and it goes into folder x, press 2 etc.) or click the folder and the file is moved into it, ignoring all filename-already-exists nonsense (just rename it and be quiet). Using drag/drop is just to annoying, slow and error prone.\nTo be clear, I'm not looking for automated sorting, I can't use it because I want to sort on video/image content.\nI was thinking about writing an applescript for this but I wanted to know if anyone knew of existing software to do this. Searching for ways to sort items all result in automated sorting based on file properties.\nThanks.\n\nA: I thought I might like to have something like this too, so I threw together an app that does this. Feel free to try it out! Warning though: I have one video where the skip value doesn't work. I'm not sure why it only has an issue with this one video... Just a heads up. It works 99% of the time though!\nPush 1 to place the video or image being shown in sort folder 1, and 2 to place it in sort folder 2. Also make sure to select a folder source with the content! This should be able to play anything that VLC can play, which is to say, pretty much everything. I don't have access to a code signing certificate at the moment, so you'll have to right click on the application from within the Finder and click \"Open\". After that you'll be good to go!\n\nA: Just a suggestion,\nVLC Media Player also supports showing picture and video files as well, so maybe select all and open them up in VLC media player?\nThen open the playlist on VLC Command + Alt + P and click on Title to sort alphabetically\nThen do the same on Finder, use View > as list or Command + 1 and click on Name\nThen show the Finder (with all your files) and VLC side by side and go through the files on VLC.\n(N for next, P for previous file on VLC)\nDrag and drop as you need.\n", "Q: How far can one go with an app before having to pay for the developer license? We are using the iAd framework, which I know you need the 99$ developer license in order to be served ads. But you also need the 99$ developer license in order to go live in the AppStore. My question is, how far can one go before having to pay this? I.e. can we do the Testflight for beta testing before having to pay that fee? Or by then will we have to have committed the 99?\nThe reason I ask is because, if the app store ultimately rejects the app you have effectively flushed the cost of the license down the drain.\n\nA: You'll need to sign your binary before submitting it for review. In order to sign it, you'll need to have a paid developer account.\nThis also is valid for TestFlight. From Apple's page on TestFlight:\n\nApps made available to external testers require a Beta App Review and must comply with the full App Store Review Guidelines before testing can begin. A review is required for new versions of your app that contain significant changes.\n\nKeep in mind that it's not a \"license\" for one app. There is no real limit on the number of apps you can develop and submit with one developer account.\n", "Q: Mac OS is reporting bad free space I have a MacBook Pro since 2014 and I haven't had any problem in these months.

My Screen Saver comes up with foreign words and gobbledygook that I don't understand.  Went into  Finder/library/Screen Savers (this is what is in my Applications) to see what I could do but there is nothing in this folder.  This looks bogus to me. Do you agree and what should I do?\n\nA: Screensavers were developed do deal with issues that affected CRT displays.

However, I have a VoIP desk phone which only gets internet via ethernet cabling.  I have tried plugging the phone directly in to my Mac, and then turning on Internet Sharing to share the connection from Wi-Fi to the ethernet ports.  But the phone does not pick up any connection.  Is this possible and how can it be done?\n\nA: Not a networking expert, but I tried using a switch in between the Mac and the VoIP phone, and it worked! No idea why the VoIP phone wouldn't work when plugging directly in to the Mac, but oh well - very happy!\n\nA: I've had a lot of experience using internet sharing under OS X. For inexplicable reasons, it's quite unreliable. Internet sharing also jumps around between OS X versions. What works in 10.5 might not work in 10.6 which might not work in 10.7, all the way though 10.10. Your trick of putting a switch in between is a good hack.\n\nYou could also try using mobile router as an access point.

My goal is to run a Windows application on my Macbook Pro.  I installed Parallels 10 on top of Yosemite and loaded a Windows 7 Ultimate image from an ISO.  This appeared to be successful, but upon restarting the machine I find I cannot do anything in Parallels.  \nTo be more specific about what I mean by \"I cannot do anything\":\n\n\n*\n\n*When I click the Parallels icon the menu bar appears at the top of the screen with the following apparent menus: File; Edit; Window; Help.  None are clickable.\n\n*Clicking the Parallels icon gives me a menu.  I selected \"Parallels Desktop Help\".  I get no response.\n\n*From the Parallels icon menu, clicking \"Show All Windows\", I get a dark blue screen, with a single large central graphic labeled \"Windows 7.pvm\".  Clicking it or anywhere else on this screen takes me back to the Yosemite desktop.\n\n*There is a folder next to the Parallels icon, labeled \"Windows 7 Applications\".  Expanding it shows the Start Menu options I might expect to see in Windows, but there is no effect from clicking any of the applications or folders (other than expanding further unusable links).  The one exception is the \"Open in Finder\" command which lets me explore these same unusable options through the Finder interface.  The result of trying to open any of these applications is the same as clicking the Parallels Desktop icon: I get an unusable Parallels Desktop menu bar at the top of the screen.  There is nothing along the top-right of the screen that appears to be related to Parallels, Windows or any such options.\n\n\nI haven't been able to find citation of this issue anywhere, but my intuition is that I'm just doing something simple in a way that is fundamentally wrong... but I don't know what that is.  \nHow can I get my Macbook Pro with Yosemite OS and Parallels Desktop 10 to run a Windows only application?\n\nA: I run Parallels in the environment you describe and that is not how Parallels behaves for me.  I believe your installation or configuration is corrupt / invalid somehow and you will definitely need to contact Parallels support and / or start over with your Mac OS / Parallels installation.  Personally I recommend contacting Parallels support.  \nFor myself, all Parallels drop down menus appear and work fine.  I am able to switch from Coherence mode to Full Screen mode, etc. easily without issue, and of course launch Windows only applications just fine.\nSo far as I can see, there is no answer to your question other than to reach out to Parallels support and / or start with a fresh installation.

Mainly though, I'd like to know the best way to manage AppleScripts designed to run continuously so they can be enabled / disabled and startup without being seen at login automatically.\n\nA: In my opinion, the best way to do it is by using Apple's own task scheduler: launchd, because you don't need to install third-party software. First, the theory: to run a script from the command line, you just run: \nosascript /PATH/TO/YOUR/script.scpt\n\nKnowing this, all you have to do is create a plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ with this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>air-mail-beta.job</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n        <string>/PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe name of the plist file doesn't matter, but it should be in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. Also, make sure to change /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPT accordingly.\nFinally, you just need to tell launchd that you want this script to always run. To do that, you just do: \nlaunchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/NAME-OF-YOUR-PLIST.plist\n\nand you're done!

I want to use Mail service so that everything is integrated with my user accounts.\nUnfortunately I only have one public IP address. Is it possible to make my second Mac a backup MX server? I would basically have the public DNS of my domain MX record point to the public static IP. Could I then use internal DNS to setup a backup email server? If I add two IP's to the same mx.example.com then mail could potentially round-robin which I don't want.

I know its not best practice but I'm also not spending $30-50 a month for backup mx service. I just want something to prevent losing mail if I upgrade/replace the primary machine.\n\nA: Your setup isn't clear: if these are home servers, isn't there a router routing all mail requests to one of your servers? \nStill, to (partially) provide an answer to your question, in your situation, you shouldn't worry about losing email: according to RFC 2821, section 4.5.4.1 about Sending Strategy: \n\nRetries continue until the message is transmitted or the sender gives\n     up; the give-up time generally needs to be at least 4-5 days.

How can this be done?\nWhat is the criteria for deleting my iPad photos? I have lost a lot of older photos without any notification or approval.\n\nA: On your first question, this is what the Apple My Photo Stream FAQ says:\n\nWhat resolution are My Photo Stream photos?\nOn a Mac or PC, your photos are downloaded and stored in full\n  resolution. On iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple TV, your photos are\n  delivered in a device-optimized resolution that speeds downloads and\n  saves storage space. Dimensions will vary, but an optimized version of\n  a photo taken by a standard point-and-shoot camera will have a 2048 x\n  1536 pixel resolution when pushed to your devices. Panoramic photos\n  can be up to 5400 pixels wide.\n\nOn the second question, the Photo Stream criteria for deletion –not the images you took or saved with the device, which stay indefinitely on the Camera Roll– is defined as follows in the same document:\n\nHow long are My Photo Stream photos stored in iCloud?\nThe photos you upload to My Photo Stream are stored in iCloud for 30\n  days to give your devices plenty of time to connect and download them.\nHow many photos are stored in My Photo Stream on my devices and computers?\nMy Photo Stream pushes all your photos to the My Photo Stream album on\n  your devices and computers, and manages them efficiently, so you don’t\n  run out of storage space.  \nYour iOS devices keep a rolling collection of your last 1000 photos in\n  the My Photo Stream album.

With Family sharing now available, we want our own iCloud accounts, but don't want to loose the photo stream we both have of our shared pictures.

Is there a way to set-up automatic sharing of photos once our accounts are split or both import our images into the same iCloud Photo Library?\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a way to retain the Photo Stream functionality –automatic sharing of every photo taken or saved in both your devices– once you stop sharing the same Apple ID.\nYou can enable Family Sharing and iCloud Photo Sharing, then manually share the pictures you choose to the \"Family\" album, which is created in the process. \nYou can achieve the same functionality –just the pictures being shared– with iCloud Photo Sharing alone and a shared album.\nThis question and answers may be of help: How can I share Photos across multiple users on Apple Photos, without paying for iCloud?\nBacking up to the same computer it's a little more convoluted, and it's described in extenso in this article at the support site on Apple; the routes described are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create multiple user accounts on the computer that will hold the backups.\n\n*Sync different playlists to different devices (not sure this is helpful in this situation).\n\n*Create a separate iTunes library for each device.\n\n\nYou will want to exercise extra caution on choosing what to sync, to avoid mixing or overwriting each other information (I'm thinking on the options to sync contacts, calendars, email, etc.).\nAfter separating the two accounts, you can regain access to bought music and apps if you set up Family Sharing.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use my iOS 8 device as USB Mass Storage Device for Windows I want to download a file to my iOS device, connect it to my windows xp computer as a USB Mass Storage Device and transfer it.\n\nA: You can download files on your iPhone from computer by moving into some app's directory in iTunes. There are a lot of apps with such functionality. For example USB Disk. But in order to access the files on another computer iTunes must be installed also. Without it the only things you can view are photos and videos.\nThere are also apps that set up a local file server which can be accessed  wirelessly from any device in the same network just by typing iPhone's ip in the browser.

While they don't advise it, I think that it can be done safely with a couple measures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Dropbox when the hard drive is mounted through AppleScript.  This shouldn't be hard because I read that there is StartOnMount or I can listen for the hard drive's \"folder\" in /Volumes like here.\n\n*Stop Dropbox when the hard drive is ejected, wherein lies the problem.  Is there an event triggered by pushing the eject button that would allow me to run a script before un-mounting?\n\n\nEither I use the above method or I somehow disable the drive from being unmounted by Mac OS X and mount and un-mount only through AppleScripts (hide it from the Finder's sidebar or, preferably, something better).  Which of those is the easier solution?\n\nA: I use to have multiple dropbox instances running at once. I think you can put db  app on the drive and use the same trick I did.\nHOME=/Volumes/Whereever/you/wanna/go; /Volumes/Whereever/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &\n\nOne thing. With this method you change your default $HOME into your new path. So Dropbox will create a folder called Dropbox in that path.\n\nA: CousinCocaine was correct about putting the Dropbox app on the drive itself.  That prohibits the drive from being ejected without closing Dropbox, except for force ejecting, which I don't plan on doing, and just yanking the cord out, which I hope I don't do (I think that the app might close as a result of the latter).  The easiest way to relocate the app is to just drag and drop it onto the drive and always run it from there.\nAs for specifying a custom location, this link shows you how to do it in the Dropbox interface.  Not only does it now look there for the files but it actually moved everything to the new location automatically.  Definitely didn't need AppleScript and I am not entirely sure why the Dropbox team don't promote this solution on their site.\n", "Q: 10.9 server keeps losing correct permissions on /private/tmp about 2-3 a week our 10.9 server machine starts filling logs with 'unable to write to /private/tmp/...\" errors.  many per second.  the permissions to go 755 apparently.\nit's easily fixed with a manual setting of permissions or a disk util repairpermissions.  but if uncaught, it causes problems for the server (of course).  nothing obvious in logs just before these errors start.\ni can't figure out what's causing this to go wonky repeatedly.  has anyone seen similar behavior?  not sure what's causing it.  nothing suspicious in chron or launchagents/daemons.    \ni'm using sns iscsi initiator, in case anyone else out there has seen this problem.\n\nA: Maybe resetting the permissions on a user's home directory helps: \nThis is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the Reset Password Utility in the Recovery Partition:\n    1   Restart your computer from the recovery partition (restart while holding CMD+R). \n    2   Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume.

I must be missing something simple here. I'm not a big Twitter user, but this seems like something that should be obvious and simple.\nI can get notifications on my iPhone (iOS 8) whenever certain people tweet. I want to get a notification when anyone ever tweets certain hashtags. Is this possible with the default Twitter app or perhaps some third-party offering?\n\nA: At first, I thought there would be a straight-forward, albeit hidden, solution. However, after doing some digging, it seems that something that should be a simple swipe or click to do is more complicated than that. This is going to be a little long, but hopefully will be incredibly helpful. I was going to post this earlier today, but did not get the chance to make this whole post until tonight.\n\nBoxcar\n\nFrom what I've seen, Boxcar.io is one of the best ways to get push notifications for tracking hashtag mentions. Both the iOS app and the web client allow a user to add a varying amount of sources to get information from. Twitter, email, RSS feeds, etc. can all be collected into Boxcar and keep track of all of your updates. Boxcar is not made specifically for what you are trying to do but the iOS app has the option of adding filters, where a group of sources can be viewed as one folder and have a key phrase that is picked out from all the sources to create a push alert.\nWhat I did in Boxcar that worked was create an RSS feed using Queryfeed.net to generate an RSS feed for the term #hashtag. Queryfeed is extremely useful for this because Queryfeed can create an RSS feed for Twitter, Google+, and Facebook using specific search terms.\n\nAfter adding all the sources that you may want (Twitter accounts, RSS feeds, etc.)  you can create a filter in the iOS app where you can select which sources you want in the feed, as well as other settings for updates.\nThere is a lot of customization that a Boxcar user can do, especially in tracking certain hashtags or trends. It is a little more work than some may want to put in and it is not problem free (in my experiments with Boxcar today there was definitely a lag in getting RSS updates at first, and the web client and iOS app are not exactly intuitive in their own unique ways) but it definitely does allow someone to track and receive alerts for specific hashtags.\nIFTTT\nThere is another option that I won't delve into as much as I did Boxcar simply because in my experience, it is a little more finicky.\nIFTTT is an app that operates in If-Then statements. An example they use on their about page is as follows: if I post a picture to Instagram, then save that photo to Dropbox. \"If\"s are called triggers (in this case, the mention of #hashtag on Twitter), and \"then\"s are called actions (getting an iOS push notification when a tweet is made using #hashtag).\nCombined, triggers and actions make Recipes. A Recipe connects Channels (the channels you would want to use are Twitter and iOS Notifications). In essence, IFTTT links one application's actions to get a reaction from another.\nWhile the user interface is a bit easier than Boxcar, IFTTT Recipes are one trigger, one action. You cannot, for example, have a feed like in Boxcar that searches for a specific term across multiple platforms, like finding the use of #hashtag in Facebook as well as Twitter. My (limited) personal experience with IFTTT is that occasionally Recipes don't want to work and I did not have the patience to figure out why. However, IFTTT is supported in Boxcar, so trying both and seeing which works best for you won't be much of a hassle.\n\nA: You could use my website https://www.MyTweetAlerts.com to get email alerts for Twitter hashtags. \nOne unique feature is that you can create emails alerts and get emails when someone tweets about some topics and the tweet has more than X likes or Y retweets or the Twitter user has more than X followers. Then you can spot Tweets that might go viral.\n", "Q: OS X Server bound to Active Directory, but OS X Clients who are logged in as AD users prompted for username when connecting to OS X server file shares OS X Server bound to Active Directory, but OS X Clients who are logged in as AD users prompted for username when connecting to OS X server file shares\nThe OS X server appears to be bound to AD with no problem.\nThis OS X server is ALSO running Apple's Open Directory (as we have a number of Mac workstations still on OpenD. that have yet to be migrated to ActiveD.)\nWindows AD users can browse the OS X File Server shares no problem\nHowever, the Mac OS X Workstation users who are logged onto their Macbooks as AD users get prompted for username+password when they try to browse the OS X Server file shares.  They can only connect using an Open Directory username+password.  They CAN NOT connct using the Active Directory credentials.\nThese same Mac workstation users can browse all the Windows domain file servers without needing to enter username+password.  \nAny idea why the OS X Server is not treating an OS X AD file-share client the same way as a Windows AD file-share client?\n\nA: Ok, to answer my own question, it appears that if the Mac client uses AFP to connect to the MAC OS X Server, then it will not use AD.\nIf I instead browse the the Mac OS X server using SMB  (eg, connect to: smb://servername )  - then it will connect as an AD user (with no prompting for username/password) and will list all the shares that AD users have access to.\n", "Q: Disk Utility weirdness: Macintosh HD cannot be repaired but then has no problems? Earlier today, I decided to clean up my hard drive of extraneous files and other materials that might be taking up space. After doing some looking around, I found an application, OnyX, that was recommended for what I was aiming to do. After starting OnyX and it doing a check of the HD, it said I needed to reboot my computer using ⌘ + R and run Disk Utility to repair the disk. After running Repair Disk on the Mac HD, I got these errors:\n\nIncorrect number of file hard links\n  Invalid directory item count\n  Orphaned file inode (id = 515789120)\n  The volume Macintosh HD could not be repaired\nMost ominous, however, was the last error message presented:\n\nError: Disk Utility can't repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nTrying to avoid what would be the worst case scenario, I quit Disk Utility, restarted the computer, and looked for answers. After finding some solutions, I tried once again to boot my computer with ⌘ + R. I ran Verify Disk as well as Verify Disk Permissions a few times, each time getting the message:\n\nThis volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK.\n\nI restarted again, this time not rebooting with ⌘ + R, and ran Disk Utility normally just to be sure, after I found and read this question. Unlike the question asker in that thread, however, I didn't face any more errors after running Disk Utility again. Multiple verifications have shown that the disk is fine and does not need to be repaired, but this leaves me puzzled. \nIs my hard drive actually functioning fine and I don't need to worry about any irrevocable errors, or is the underlying problem still there and I need to fix it before it worsens?\n\nA: I have found that when Disk Utility can't repair a disk then it is time for DiskWarrior or another third-party disk repair utility. They can often fix what Disk Utility can not.\nHowever that the issue went away, seemingly by magic, makes Froggard's guess probable.\nI would, however, keep an eye on the disk with disk utility. Use the verify function from time to time and if it does not return then it was indeed a transient error that the O/S was able to repair itself.\n", "Q: 3 referenced files in your library will not upload to iCloud Photo Library error \nSelect referenced files in your library and choose “Consolidate” from\n  the File menu to copy the original files into the library.\n\nI get the following error messages when I try and sync my Photos Library on my mac with iCloud and then it just says 'Updating' indefinitely.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?

There are about 80,000 emails in an IMAP trash folder. How do I get rid of these emails? \nPerhaps my phone was set up incorrectly but I have no reason to want to keep these.\n\nA: The setting that you are looking for is buried in advanced mail settings.\nOpen Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calenders > (Choose the IMAP account in question) > (choose it again) > Advanced \nThis screen will have a section titled \"Deleted Messages\", Set \"Remove\" to an option other than \"never\".\nFor what it's worth, it's the mail client, not the mail server, that is responsible for cleaning up the trash folder.  The client is the program or app that you use to read email, in this case your iPhone.  Many people have problems with this setting when using multiple clients, such as an iPhone, iPad, and Mac or PC at the same time.  In that case if the clients don't all have the same thing for this setting, whichever has the shortest time period is the device that will prevail.\nNote: changing the setting should fix your issue, although it might not be an instant fix. I'm not positive how it will behave with 80,000 trash emails to cleanup.\nAlternate: A more immediate method appears to be, open mail which will open your inbox, back up one screen by clicking whatever is the the top left (likely the account name, it will vary depending on how your phones is setup), then in the Accounts section choose your \"Account\" (not your Inbox for that account), from there select the trash folder, click \"Edit\" on the top right, and then \"delete all\" in the bottom right,  and \"delete all\" again to confirm.  Also be sure to adjust the advanced setting above so that in the future your trash folder will be maintained automatically for you.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Inbox >> Edit >> Mark All >> Mark As Read\n\n*Open Inbox >> Edit >> Check/select the top message; it will highlight the move button.\n\n*Press and hold the move button and uncheck the message that you had checked earlier. \n\n*Lift all your fingers off from the ipad screen and leave it alone. Wait until all your messages pile up on the right hand portion of the screen (in ipad); iphone will give you the actual number of emails it has selected for the action. Now they are just waiting for your command to be moved ALL at once. \n\n*Choose trash to delete all of them or any other folder where u want to move them, like one piece. Remember this will replicate your action on the server so you will ACTUALLY move them or delete them on the server and not just the ipad. \n\n\nOnce you have moved all messages to the trash you can either leave them there for the scheduled cleaning or empty it right away by doing this: go to trash folder and touch Edit. The Delete All button shows up at the bottom of the screen. Hit it! You’re done! \nIf you do not see the effects of your actions on the server make sure you have enabled your email accounts for such actions.\n", "Q: Removing computer name from terminal Right now, this is what my Terminal shows:\nMyName's-MacBookPro:location MyName$\n\nI'd like for it to only show my name, so something like this:\nMyName$\n\nWhen I browsed online for a solution, they said to edit my .bashrc file.

At that time I connected an external 2TB HDD (HFS+ single partition, not connected all the time) to it via USB as a Time Machine backup destination. Later I turned off Time Machine and use the HDD to store some pictures. Months after that I upgraded to OS X 10.10 and now 10.11 Beta 1. \nToday I noticed my disk space not enough so I scanned the disk for big files, only to find there is a lost+found folder in my external HDD, which takes nearly 1TB of space. The content of which is files I deleted during the days, most of them originated from internal SSD (And I never put them into that HDD), the create time of which are all in 2014. All the files are named like iNodexxxxxxxxxx and directories dir_xxxxxxxxxxx .\nWhy are my deleted files now found in an external disk? Is it safe to delete the whole folder without affecting anything outside?\n\nA: The name is historic from unix. The filesystem is designed to track files and when there is a problem, the filesystem will under some repair operations, lose files to remain workable. (hence the need for backups)\nThose files that would be lost in this operation are stored in the lost+found folder so that you could perhaps use them if they are undamaged or at least inspect them to know what files are now corrupt or missing.\nThe program that moves files into lost+found and repairs the filesystem is [fsck][1]\nYou should delete the folder and all it's contents once you decide you don't need to learn anything from it. Also, you should run Disk Utility or fsck to see if you can get a clean run or if you need to erase that volume and start over/replace it.\n", "Q: IDE for R in OSX?

I'm doing mobile development and program on a Windows development machine.  However, I need to reach the Xamarin Build Host on my Mac Mini OS X Yosemite server.  Is it possible to remote into this Mac from outside my network?  I have a fixed IP for the network, but need to know how to assign ports to the various machines on the network.   \n\nA: Port forwarding examples:\nWhen you set port-forwarding on your router, you pick a port number (or range of ports) and a single local IP address, ie. port 5900 and Ip address 192.168.0.2. So any internet traffic coming in on port 5900 gets sent directly to the computer on the IP address 192.168.0.2.\n\n\n*Answered above, you've specified one of the IP addresses in the port forwarding. It will be the IP address you specified in the DHCP address reservations.\n\n*It's only as secure as your password. I'm sure that the password is encrypted before transmission back to your Macs.\nYou need to set up port forwarding in your Router.\nDepending on your Router's make/model, the setup may vary, but the basics are the same regardless.\nI would choose a port way north of 1 or 2.\nBoth computers will be listening on port 5900, so you'd set something up like:\n85.85.85.85:15000 --> 192.168.0.99:5900\nand\n85.85.85.85:16000 --> 192.168.0.100:5900\n", "Q: Why do I have to update to the most recent iOS version? I have an iPhone 4s that is still running iOS 5.1.1. Why is it not possible for me to update my device to  a newer version of ios without going all the way to the latest?\n\nA: Short answer: Because that's Apple's update policy.\nLonger answer: Maintaining and supporting several major iOS versions is a lot of work, even if the older versions would just get security fixes. It's not just about the source code, any update also needs testing, dealing with apps which may break, update of various support documents etc. So you get both new functionality and security fixes by staying with the most recent version. In your case, running iOS 8 on an 4S actually works quite fine. \n\nA: Apple has decided to remove previous versions when a new (replacement) is released.\nYou could scan the web and find other versions from someone else but not from Apple.\n\nA: The same reason why nobody takes Samsung and HTC seriously: if your device can handle the latest but you won't update to the latest, you're just going to miss out on features and optimizations. You also risk your security and the security of others.\nBecause there are very few situations where you should be on any older than the latest version your system can handle, Apple instructs iTunes and OTA updates to use the latest ROM available for the device.\nIf you want a newer but old version so badly, hack your iTunes.\n", "Q: reducing dimension of an icon with Preview I had an png icon file of dimension 40*40 with a size of 2 KB.

But it is not happening?\n\nA: There are multiple algorithm to optimize the size of PNG files.\nPreview is known to not be not optimal on that point. \nIf you want to optimize the size of your PNG, there are multiple tools available on the web. \nJust by randomly searching on google :\n\n\n*\n\n*https://pngquant.org/\n\n*https://imageoptim.com/\n\n*http://www.gingerbeardman.com/pngenie/\n\nA: Not all PNG files are created equal. Two pixel identical PNG files can be different file sizes.\nTime vs CPU\nThe size of the file depends greatly on the amount of processing time spent during its creation.\nAn application like Preview.app is quick to save but creates larger PNG files.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, a free tool like ImageOptim.app will spend minutes on larger PNG files trying a wide range of parameters searching for the smallest PNG file.\nMany web developers and graphic artists use tools like ImageOptim to post-process their artwork before it is distributed.\n\nImageOptim\n\nImageOptim is a free app that makes images take up less disk space and load faster, without sacrificing quality. It optimizes compression parameters, removes junk metadata and unnecessary color profiles.\nImageOptim seamlessly integrates the best optimization tools: PNGOUT, Zopfli, Pngcrush, AdvPNG, extended OptiPNG, JpegOptim, jpegrescan, jpegtran, and Gifsicle.\n\n", "Q: To install Blockdev in OSX? I did not find the command in Brew of Yosemite 10.10.3. \nI am reading the command developed from here:\npv -s $(blockdev –getsize64 /Users/masi/Dropbox/1/r3.raw)\n\nI think blockdev is Linux specific command at the moment and not existing directly in OSX. \nHow can you install Blockdev in OSX?\n\nA: If you want to get the size of a mounted block device (which is what blockdev -getsize64 does), you can use the following:\ndiskutil information <device> | grep \"Total Size\" | sed -e 's/[^(]*(([^Bytes)]*\\).*/\\1/'\n\nIf you want to do the same for a file, you can use the following (amongst many others):\nstat -f '%z' <filename>\n\n", "Q: How do I get the trackpad (force touch) to recognise a click right after a scroll? I use CAD software and a really common action is to zoom out (two finger scroll) followed by a click and drag to pan around the document.\nOn the new MBR pro with force touch trackpad I'm finding that if I do those operations in quick succession the click isn't recognised at all. Instead if have to do a deliberate finishing of the zoom before starting the click. As you can imagine, that's pretty frustrating when you do it all day.\nI recently had my macbook stolen and was forced to upgrade from an old 2008 macbook to a new MBR pro. So I've gone from OS 10.6 to 10.10 and from the older trackpad to the new force touch one. This means I'm not sure if it's a change in the OS that I'm trying to track down or something to do with the new force touch trackpad.\nI installed BetterTouchTool to see if there was anything in there that looked like it would help. It had a \"live view\" so I could see what the trackpad was seeing and the movements (and clicking) are all being \"seen\" by the software. It's just that the driver won't acknowledge the click until the scroll is done.\nAny ideas of what I can do to tweak this behaviour?\nEdit - try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*scroll down using two fingers on this page\n\n*lift one finger and apply pressure with the other to do a click\n\n*drag up to the top right as you're doing it to simulate a click and drag\n\n\nalternatively:\n\n\n*\n\n*scroll down using two fingers on this page\n\n*use your thumb to click and index finger to drag up to the top right\n\n\nYou'll see that it takes almost a second to recognise that you're trying to click. The only way to be sure of getting the click is to end the scroll before rolling into the click.\nThis was not a problem on the older trackpads because they had a physical button, so they knew when you had transitioned to the click. Now that it's the force system it's not distinguishing between them so well - evidently it has a delay in it before it acknowledges that you're definitely trying to click.\n\nA: In Preferences/Accessibility/Trackpad there are additional (pre force touch) trackpad options such as 3 finger drag. I don't use CAD so cannot say if the exact scenario can be addressed, but it is worth a look. \n\nA: Use a two finger to pinch to zoom in and out, use two fingers to pan around the image or webpage. \nThis is the default setting in System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom. There is no lag.\n", "Q: Mouse hover doesn't work when Microsoft mouse is connected I'm using the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop for one and a half years now and had no problems with it.\nA couple of days ago I noticed weird behaviour with the mouse. The same behaviour was with the trackpad as long as the mouse's dongle was connected to the Mac. \nAny mouse-over/hover behaviour is gone. The Dock doesn't pop up automatically, no tooltips or sub-menus (which only open when hovering the curser above them) show up.\nI did do some changes before I noticed it. I created an admin account and set my personal account to standard; I activated the firewall; I activated FileVault. I'm uncertain if this is just a coincidence. \nAdditionally, a strange side effect occurs when plugging the dongle in or out: If a web browser is opened, you can see that the web-page's layout slightly shifts horizontally. \nMy Mac's specs:\nOSX 10.10.3 (14D136)\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\nThe keyboard/mouse combo: Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop\nUpdate\nI tried replacing the batteries, which did not help.\nI tried out the mouse on my colleagues Mac and it had the same behaviour.\nInterestingly, when I turn off the mouse while keeping the dongle plugged in, the track pad behaves normal again.\n\nA: This is most likely your mouse failing, which is not related to the changes you made. It seems that the mouse is only reporting the cursor location when it is clicked, and the fact that a webpage shifts horizontally when the dongle is plugged and unplugged and the mouse is not being moved is a sign that the mouse is sending false information to the computer. \nBefore you get a new mouse, try replacing the batteries in all of your wireless mouse/keyboard devices, and try using a different mouse in case it is a problem with the computer.\n\nA: I know it's an old thread but since there are no solution mentioned for the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse... I had the same problem and fixed it just now. \nIt is a hardware issue where the little button below the Windows blue button gets stuck. I had two of these and the one where it was clickable, it worked fine and the second one had the button stuck and the hover over wasn't working.\nI stuck a push pin into it and tried to pry it out through the rubber layer on it and it now works fine.\nSo it was down to poor quality buttons on this nice mouse.\n\nA: I've noticed a similar problem with my Microsoft mouse. However I'm not sure if it's just a generic bug or related to Microsoft mouse & keyboard. On restart it usually fixes the problem for an hour or so.   \nNeed to test this in more depth, but I don't use my keyboard setup often enough to know for sure.\n\nA: Solution without need damage the mouse\nIm having this problem with the same mouse and the button below the windows button is stuck (like the reply of Jaime Santa Cruz says)\nBUT, how i want avoid lose my warranty making any damage on the mouse (i go send this mouse to microsoft in the next days), im using a temporary fix with USB Overdrive. I just install it, and in config, i put the button 4 and 5, to \"Do nothing\".\nThis make the stuck button stop \"working\" software side, and the hover work again.\nPS: You need install overdrive, restart the system. After this, go to the system preferences and change the overdrive options.\nPS2: Overdrive is a shareware, but only have a message on system start-up and a 10 seconds delay on pref panel, you can use it with full options.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but I ran into this after issue and it was driving me crazy. I used a cutter to open the rubber over the switch and as soon as I did that the button was clickable again and hover was working too. It's like over time it develops a \"air seal\" that sticks the button.\n", "Q: How to delete photos from iPhoto/Phots with a particular filename format? I have a phone that stores 2 images every time I take a picture. One is a high resolution photo and the other is a low resolution photo.\nWhen I connect my phone to the mac, it imports all the photos into iPhotos, Photos and into the Pictures folder.\nI want to keep only the high resolution photos and delete the low resolution ones..\nA sample of the file name format for the 2 images is shown below.\n\n\n*\n\n*WP_20150402_16_44_11_Pro__highres.jpg\n\n*WP_20150402_16_44_11_Pro.jpg\n\n\nI can very easily delete the low resolution photos from the Pictures folder.\nHow do I do the same in iPhotos and Photos app?\n\nA: I'm not sure either iPhoto or Photos would be keen on you deleting pictures from inside the app folder framework. \nThey both expect to be 'in charge' of the editing & deleting process.\nI think, long term it may be better, if you want your 'originals' in a single format in each of the 3 locations to use Image Capture to do the import, to a distinct 4th location; folder on the desktop etc.\nThen do your file trimming & only afterwards import to iPhoto, Photos & finally move the files to your Pictures folder.\nAutomator might be best to do the initial file cull.  \nThis example 'Folder Action' will throw out anything NOT containing '_highres'\nNote the 'None' parameter in the filter, circled in red.\nFolder Actions will trigger every time the Target folder is changed, by adding or removing content.\n\n", "Q: Accidentally unloaded all launchctl daemons and now can't boot While trying to set up some services (OS X 10.10 Yosemite), I accidentally did a sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and the screen was frozen immediately.

Unfortunately, I don't have a working time machine backup, my external hard drive crashed some days ago.\nI can still boot into recovery mode, using Cmd+R while booting. I can also access the terminal.

How can I tell OS X to load all the LaunchDaemons on startup?\n\nA: for a persistent fix you can login to single user mode, then mount -uw /,\nand then delete the launchctl override database.\nI'm not sure for Yosemite, but on Sierra that would be rm /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/*.plist.\nafter that you can just exit or reboot.\nthis is not as a sledgehammer as it seems. the system re-enableds some of its overrides (from various other configuration files i guess) and so you actually get a nice and fresh override db without masses of \"disabled: false\".\n", "Q: Why can't I execute mysql without the full path?

Now I have my 2015 MBP I now need to use the T shaped MagSafe2 charger. The only issue is because the angle the wire is on the connecter (and not going in the port as much) this makes it very easy for it to fall out of my computer when I move it (it gets very annoying!).\nIs it possible somehow to make the charger stronger without modifying it too much?\n\nA: There is a product that also can help with this. \nhttp://www.snuglet.com\nIt works by using a tiny machined piece of metal inside of the port on the computer to strengthen the connection of the magsafe 2 connector.\n\nA: There are three axes to consider when measuring the force needed to separate a MagSafe 2.\nThere are two great articles that cover the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/article/2895694/will-your-new-macbook-crash-to-the-ground-without-magsafe-yes.html\n\n*http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/slippin-and-a-slidin/\n\nThe MagSafe 2 is quite strong if you have a direct yank or pull as discussed in the USB-C discussion above. The snuglet or a knot you tie won't help much at all for the direct yank. However, I've not heard of people feeling that one direction was too easy to disconnect.\nThe MagSafe is very underpowered if you push or pull it in the N (normal force) direction in the above diagram from Mac World. This is also the “put the Mac on a pillow” force that many people don’t want to have disconnect the charger. The snugglet fixes this problem exceptionally. It physically shims the magsafe adapter into the unibody frame for a snug fit. A cable knot won’t help you there either since the force needed to disconnect is so little, the knot can’t absorb or redirect a pull in this direction (and if you are pushing on the magnet end, no cable knot can help.\nThe last axis you can consider is if you pull the cord along the table plane (assuming your Mac is open on a kitchen table) and pull the cord towards the chair where you would sit. The force needed to disconnect the adapter is less than the force needed for a yank/pull but more than is needed in the vertical (normal force) direction. The snuglet helps here a little since a little is all that’s needed. A knot can help here both by acting as a shock absorber and to help possibly redirect some of that pull to the yank direction. \n\nA: You can turn it into an approximation of an L or even a U by the simple expedient of tying a knot in it.\nThis is my standard way of dealing with any awkward cable.\nIt's not perfect, but boy, it's cheap ;-)\nL-knot\n\nU-knot\n\nFrom comments - the U-knot is achieved by simply wrapping one end through a second time, if it's not clear from the picture.\nBTW - keep the knot very loose, so you don't damage anything.\nFrom further comments -\nOf course, no knot is going to help if the cable gets yanked, in any direction;  this idea is really just to set the cable off in the direction of the PSU, if that's not to the left of the machine.\nJust reducing its tendency to want to be straighter in the 'wrong' direction, nothing more, & reducing pull angularly, rearwards, which is what the older L-plug would do naturally, thereby reducing the lever length of the T-cable in that one direction.\n", "Q: How to debug Safari CPU utilization and spinning beach ball? I have been plagued by performance problems in my late 2010 MacBook Air for several months now. Most of it seems centred around Safari. I regularly get very high fan speeds (loud to the point of very annoying), very warm laptop, high load average, and spinning BBOD (beach ball of death), especially on Safari.\nI consistently have a single window, 8-10 tabs, none of them heavy dynamic apps (Gmail and Calendar running in Chrome). \nI regularly have CPU spikes from Safari and WebContent (and at times soagent). They rarely last very long, but when they do, I see the BBOD and Safari is completely unusable, then the rest of the laptop slows down to a crawl.\nI have taken a spindump of Safari - it takes a very long time - but I do not actually know how to interpret it to see where it is stuck. \nI have almost no extensions installed. Just 1Password, AdBlock and ClickToPlugin (which was installed specifically to prevent Flash and others from bogging it down).\nWhat can I do to narrow down the issue?\n\nA: Adblock runs against every frame in the page. This is probably not all of your problem, but it is significant, at least it was for me. Switch to ublock and you should see a difference.

Can the administrator on my home PC access these files? Recently my texts were accessed somehow and I'm not exactly sure how this person did it. We share the same PC at home but have separate user accounts with passwords on them. My iCloud and iTunes also is password protected. However, this person is the administrator of the PC. Are there any files that this person has access to that could be from having my iPhone automatically backed up to iCloud though a wifi connection? Is there anything I can do to keep this from happening in the future?\n\nA: Assuming your talking about Windows and the other user has administrator rights:\nThere are tools that may allow the Windows administrator account (which has access to all files on the computer) to view locally stored backups and extract them. This will only be possible if the data is actually on this computer, and not encrypted.\nIf you are sure that is not the case –because you only backup to iCloud– this person will need your Apple ID and password to access your iCloud data. This information may be stored in your session (recorded by Chrome for instance) but it is encrypted with a key associated with your Windows password, so not accessible to the administrator.\nIf the administrator changed or knew your Windows user password he could have accessed your session and pretty much all of your data. You will notice on the first case because he will have asked you to recreate it, or use a new one. It does not seem possible for the administrator to see your stored password, only to reset it.\nFinally, someone could have installed a keylogger or some other form of monitoring on this computer, and all the information entered could be retrieved.\nOn the other hand iMessage is encrypted end to end according to Apple and others, but probably available to Apple or someone with access to Apple's servers (see this answer on Information Security SE). Sniffing your traffic on the local network and extracting iMessage from there does not seem to be a feasible attack vector.\nTo keep this from happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your Apple ID password. Check your recovery email and security answers to see if it any of them have been changed.\n\n\nIf you use the PC to access iCloud\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your Windows user password.\n\n*Don't store passwords on your Windows user session (browsers mainly). At least not your iCloud password or the passwords of the email accounts associated to it.\n\n*If you suspect a keylogger or other monitoring tools, stop entering information associated to iCloud on this computer.\n\n", "Q: VMware Fusion upgrade What's VMWare Fusion upgrade policy?

So, I'm thinking of upgrading my MBP (13' late 2011) with an internal SSD drive. I'm wondering if the increase in speed of read and write on the SSD internal drive, will increase peroformance and stability while reading data from other external HDD drives. I have a lot of data stored on external drives (iTunes, Photos, Audio sound libraries, ...) and wondering if I can expect significant improve on dealing with that external data on a daily basis. Thank you.\n\nA: Honestly, it is a waste not to have an SSD as an internal drive in a MacBook (or any computer in general), you will understand it once you have one. Of course, the speed of your internal drive has absolutely nothing to do with that of external ones. The latter is only governed by the respective bus speed they are connected to. \n\nA: Using internal SSD will make your system faster overall, including access to peripherals.\nWith that said, you might or might not notice the access speed change to external HDD.\nThat would depend how busy the resources was/is. System will still use the RAM as means to communicate between the disks. Assuming you have no bottleneck there, next possible slow down would be your connection to the external HDD.\nIf it is USB2 you get what you get there is no way around that and you might not see improvement. But if it is Thunderbolt or USB3 then you will see a improvement. \nHere are some numbers:\nUSB2 max speed is 60 MB/sec (480 Mb/sec). Typically you will get less than that so around 30-40 MB/sec. With Thuderbolt or USB3 you will get 10 times the speed of USB2. If your goal is to increase the access sped to external drives, the solution is obvious.\n", "Q: My iMac makes no sound at all My iMac abruptly stopped making any sounds while I was using Garageband.

If I disable Location Services, will Find My iPhone continue to work? I turned off Location Services, but iOS 8.3 is allowing me to leave Find My iPad turned on. The message underneath says though:\nLocating your iPad on a map is disabled. Turn on Location Services to enable it.\n\nA: No, Find My iPhone will not continue to work if Location Services is disabled. However, if you enable lost mode, it will automatically enable Location Services.  \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201357\n\nIn iOS 7, if you turn off Location Services and use Find My iPhone\n  Lost Mode, Location Services will be re-enabled on the device as long\n  as the device is in Lost Mode. Once Lost Mode is disabled, Location\n  Services will return to its previous state.\n\n\nA: If you go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, you can toggle Location Services being on and off. If you turn LS off, everything that uses your GPS location won't be able to fully function. It ranges from small things, like Snapchat's filter options not being available to you, to large things, like Maps not being able to use GPS location. Which is why Find My iPhone will not function if you turn LS off completely.\nHowever, you can manage which applications use your location and which do not. Since I am often on the go, and don't want apps like Twitter or Facebook to post my location, I have it set to \"Never\" for whether or not I allow those apps to access LS. But for apps like Maps and Find My iPhone, I have it set to allow them to access LS and use my location. If you don't do that, you won't be able to use Maps, Find My iPhone, or any app that utilizes the LS function.\n", "Q: Messages going to the Mac from my iPod Every time I have a message sent to me, it's sent to my family's Mac and my iPod.

(I don't want remote access to the mac.)\nMy memory is that Apple had a built in client with a non-obvious name, perhaps \"screen\", which they \"fixed\" a few releases ago to only work if the VNC server was itself from Apple, running on a Mac. Perhaps they have since unfixed it. \nI once used \"chicken of the vnc\", which was flaky on whatever OS X release I had 2 years ago. I also used another non-apple client from that Mac, which was flaky in different ways. (The built in app was unusable.) \nIIRC, I was using \"Tightvnc\" or \"Realvnc\" on my servers at that time, which had worked fine with the first random windows-based VNC client I tried.  \nAll I've heard about so far are \n\n\n*\n\n*\"screen sharing app\" from apple, possibly pre-installed on the mac,\nname and location unknown\n\n*a client from realvnc that runs in the chrome browser (ugh!)\n\n\nWhen referring to OS X releases, please use release numbers in your answers, not just names of cats - or else link to a page that translates the cat names to release numbers. I don't have Apple's release code names memorized.\n[Update, after first answer received: alternativeto.net is a great source for finding software of this type. I now have tigervnc running on one server and on the Mac client. No flakiness so far, but the Mac client for tigervnc seems unwilling to let me connect to multiple servers at the same time, and Mac's GUI interface seems unwilling to let me launch multiple copies of the client program. So still looking for alternatives, but making progress. \nStill trying to figure out how to invoke the client built into OSX - it's not at the path I found on the net, /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications  Looks like I need to know the right invocation to feed to Finder, which doesn't have anything like a button labelled 'screen sharing'. I did find a menu item labelled \"connect to server\", but that just gives me connection failures, perhaps because it's defaulting a URI type of afp:// which probably has nothing to do with vnc - or perhaps because the tool is unrelated to vnc.]\n\nA: The built-in VNC client with OS X works just great with most VNC servers I've tried on FreeBSD.  I've mostly been using TigerVNC from ports (seems to be the fastest with OS X's VNC client), and the only issue I have is when I restart the VNC server while connected to it.  The OS X VNC client will reconnect (great!) but it sizes the window oddly, and I can't resize it.  Since scaling is turned on, this usually results in a small screen that cannot be read.  Just restart the VNC client (or close the window and open a new connection, if you've got multiple connections open), and it's all OK again.\nSince I have xterms open all the time on my mac, I generally do it like so:\nopen vnc://<host>:<port>\n\nwhere <port> is the TCP port on which the server is running.\nE.g. if it's :1, you'd use 5901 as <port>.  You can even install the avahi port, and set up a service, so the VNC session shows up in Finder (although there's a Finder preference to change to make them show up since OS X 10.8, IIRC), just like a Mac that has \"screen sharing\" enabled (i.e. it's running a VNC server).\n\nA: Real VNC or VNC Viewer are the same client (aside from platform) as used on Windows PCs for decades. OS X is designed to work with VNC protocol out of the box. \nAs an added bonus, Real VNC is available as a free iOS app. \nThe only real concerns you should have in using it are security hardening, ie restricting access to specific IP addresses or users. \n\nA: What you are looking for is the built in Screen Sharing app which resides in System/Library/CoreServices.  It can connect to most VNC servers and is slightly faster than other options such as RealVNC.\n\nA: If you go to the RealVNC website and choose \"Download > Viewer\" you get a native OSX app that works nicely for me. I'm not exactly sure about the licensing terms, but going through \"Products > Product Selector\" on the homepage seems to indicate that the Viewer is free (while the Server is licensed).\nThe built-in Apple Screen Sharing works nicely too, although I experienced hangs with xterm on the remote (tracked as \"linux xterm problem\" in Apple Support Communities). The built-in is accessible from Safari through vnc://hostname in the address bar. If launched once, you can right-click on the icon in the dock and choose Options > Keep in Dock for easy access.\nThe \"Chicken\" VNC did not work for me at all.\n\nA: You can connect to remote Linux machines with your Mac's built-in vnc client.\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup the vnc server on the remote Linux machine.\n\n*On your Mac, go to Finder. Press cmd+K or Go > Connect to Server.\n\n*In the Server Address, enter vnc://{HOST}:{PORT}. For example vnc://linux.myhost.com:5901.\nA VNC session will be connected to the remote Linux machine with the Screen Sharing application.\n\nA: I don't have a lot of recent experience with VNC on the Mac but if you look at this (on stackexchange.com) it will explain how to connect to another client via the O/S X VNC server.\nApple's version is called Remote Desktop, the commercial version is just Apple Remote Desktop and really designed to manage Macs. I've used the latter but never tried to connect to a strictly VNC client. Not sure if it is possible.\n\nA: The best explanation I've seen for how to use apple's \"screen\" as a vnc client is at http://www.davidtheexpert.com/post.php?id=5\nHe seems unaware of the period when apple had broken compatibility with non-apple VNC servers, but other than that his instructions seem great, and work beautifully on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6.

Finder may not be directly responsible for this, but it appears that OSX crawls my filesystem and indexes all of the images, music, movies, and whatnot that it can find everywhere.

How do I do this? I installed postgres via Homebrew and have experience with Linux but not much with Macs.\n\nA: Have you checked to see if it is already there?  Most postgres installers will create it for you, and so running grep postgres /etc/passwd will tell you if it exists.  Most system accounts on macs start with _, so if you do have to create it, you might consider calling it _postgres, which seems to be common.\nThe question is similar to question 82472, which should provide what you need to create an account from the command line.

Many years ago - when I was a Windows user - I had an application which made renaming files an amazingly simple experience. You would select the files you wish to work with, and their filenames would appear within what was essentially a huge textarea. Imagine a text editor (such as TextEdit, Sublime Text, etc.) open to a document that simply lists all filenames, with each filename on a new line.\nWith the files in this interface, you had your \"standard\" find/replace tools (CMD+F), as well as the ability to use REGEX. You could use the keyboard's arrows to move around the filenames without extra clicks or bulky interfaces. Modified filenames were highlighted with a different background and applying changes to all files was a simple CMD+S. \nDoes something like this exist for OSX?\n// edit - to clarify: I'm aware of OSX's built-in bulk file renaming options in Finder, and software along the likes of NameChanger, Renamer, Automator, ABetterFinderRename, etc. I'm specifically looking for software with the kind of UI I described.\n// edit 2 - the original Windows software is called Oscar's Renamer: http://www.mediachance.com/free/renamer.htm\n\nA: Emacs can do this.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Emacs\n\n*C-x C-f and open the directory.

So far, I love it. It works great... usually. Plenty of people online have complained about slow load times when opening apps, especially 3rd party ones. But for me, they rarely open at all. I'll wait for minutes, long enough for the device to lock, and still nothing. The only solution now is to restart (usually a forced restart by holding down both buttons on each device) both devices and try again. It's getting to the point where it's pretty frustrating to have to restart at least twice or thrice daily, especially since when I enter my password (it's text) on my iPhone, it freezes for 3-5 minutes and then restarts and lets me use Touch ID. Restarting sometimes doesn't solve the problem anyhow.\nAnyone else having this issue? It's been happening now for a few weeks.\nSome stats:\n\n\n*\n\n*My watch arrived on June 1, 2015\n\n*My watch has 82 applications, 100 photos, and no songs\n\n*My watch is running watchOS 1.0.1\n\n*My watch has 5.6 GB of space available\n\n*My phone is an iPhone 5s 64 GB running iOS 8.3\n\n*My phone has 238 MB left (but that fluctuates frequently; could this be a source of the issue?)\n\n*My phone often has problems staying on wifi and likes to drift off onto 4G whenever it feels like it (sporadically, and not super often, but I felt this was mention-worthy)\n\n*My phone is around 2 years old now\n\n\nThanks in advance.\nUpdate: I've realized that restarting my Apple Watch might be enough to temporarily solve the problem, and the issue only seems to come up after I install a new app on it. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Apple Watch app on my iPhone is faulty, and often crashes or does not work properly.\nUpdate 2: Now I think I can  positively state that there is no pattern to my Apple Watch functioning or not. I've just proven the previous update wrong, then. I wish this issue had some predictability.\nUpdate 3: My watch has been pretty good all of today (June 29, 2015), but just started acting up again. Here are a few things I noted that may prove useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*The watch responded perfectly for at least 3 hours straight, during which I was able to use it to read books, search the web, and add cards to Trello lists.\n\n*I attempted to load Trello an hour later. The app loaded, but after loading, it showed the circular loading icon on the home screen without any of the icons showing.\n\n*I did some testing:\n\n\n*\n\n*I let Trello run, and it crashed.\n\n*I opened it again. I timed 32 or so seconds before it crashed again, staying on the loading screen this time.\n\n*I restarted the watch normally, and tried again, but it didn't load.\n\n*I then force restarted the watch, letting it sit on my wrist for a few minutes after starting up. It didn't ask for my password.\n\n*I immediately went to the Trello app. After maybe 5 seconds (I didn't time this one), it loaded perfectly.\n\n\n\nI'm baffled by the apparent lack of a pattern here.\nUpdate 4: This is starting to feel like a journal. There truly is no pattern. All day (June 30, 2015) I have been restarting both my iPhone and Apple Watch, with the watch working for only 10 or so minutes at a time. I can't get any apps to load consistently.\nIf I discover any other clues, I'll post another update.\n\nA: Not sure if you're still having this issue and this is also for future users who have the same problem as well. A lot of people experience the app not loading problem. \nThe solution to this is fairly easy. All you have to do is restart your Apple Watch. You can do so by pressing on the side buttons (Digital Crown and the button below it) at once. Just wait for it to restart. If it doesn't help, reset it into factory settings.\nSource: Cupertino Watch\n", "Q: Where can I find and download of old Garageband loops online?

You can also try apple through a google search as they did have multiple free loops. eBay is another source or local stores.Local mac user clubs amy also be able to help.

In the Finder, hold down the option key and select \n\nGo > Library\n\nfrom the menu bar. \nThe reading list is stored in the file Safari/Bookmarks.plist in the Library folder. \nYou have two choices:\nRestore the file from a backup that predates the issue; or\nMove the file to the Desktop, relaunch Safari, and import from the old bookmarks file (File > Import Bookmarks...).\n", "Q: Confused about network unlocked,carrier unlocked,factory unlocked I'm new to iPhones,if a phone is stated to be network unlocked,carrier unlocked and factory unlocked will it be able to be used with any carrier? The iPhone is a iPhone 5 \n    Thank you.  Loritiana123\n\nA: Yes, but not Necessarily any carrier.\nNetwork unlocked, carrier unlocked, factory unlocked all essentially mean that the phone can be used on any carrier that model is designed to work.  There is different meaning factory unlocked suggests the phone was never carrier locked and bought directly from Apple for the full retail price.  Carrier unlocked suggests that it was once locked to a carrier and has now been unlocked.  Network unlock could mean either.\nDetermine the exact model number of the phone. For an iPhone 5 it's likely A1428 (GSM) or A1429 (has both CDMA and GSM models).\nConsult this table on Apples website to see which models work on which carriers by country.  (You will need to scroll down considerably to reach the iPhone 5 section.)\nThe model number is printed on the back cover of the phone.

I found this even works across phones when I have tried it -- awesome! But if not, they are lost for good, afaik, and you cannot recover them again. They're gone.\nThis is why I usually consider Voice Memos obsolete, and would recommend recording voice snippets with the Camera instead (cover the lens if you want) and leave Voice Memos alone. The reason is that media is generally backed up to iCloud more often, and therefore is much harder to lose, while making it easily accessible on your Mac, plus other devices, and cloud account, obeying the \"three places\" rule. Of course, for better privacy, you could simply carry a real voice recorder, or another phone/PDA/tablet/other mobile with a SD card slot and record on that.\n", "Q: How to register AppleScript as default web browser in Yosemite? This is essentially the same question as How to register an AppleScript as a potential default web browser?, but the solution there doesn't seem to work on Yosemite (LSIsAppleDefaultForScheme no longer exists).\nI've written an AppleScript, saved as an application, and checked \"Stay Open.\" I've also added a CFBundleURLTypes entry to the Info.plist with http and https and identifier \"Web site URL,\" mimicking entries in other browsers' plists. I think basically the same procedure worked when I last tried on Mavericks.\nNevertheless, LaunchServices doesn't seem to be picking up the applet as a possible default web browser. I've already tried rebuilding the LaunchServices DB and opening and quitting the applet a few times.\nAnybody else tried to do this recently?\n\nA: My experience is that you can no longer define an AppleScript applet as the default handler upfront by the Info.plist. And, if you try, by including LSIsAppleDefaultForScheme in your Info.plist, that applet will no longer even be allowed as a handler for the URL type at all. After upgrading to Yosemite, my applet would no longer be called when I clicked a link using my custom protocol. I instead got the not-handled system error when clicking the link. Once I removed LSIsAppleDefaultForScheme, it began to work again. \nIt seems perhaps more difficult to get Mac OS X to recognize alternate handlers for http and https. When I tried setting my Info.plist for those, the applet failed to show as an option for \"Default web browser\" in the General system preference pane. However, the third-party preference panel RCDefaultApp was able to see and set my applet as the handler for the http protocol by using its URLs section, and that seemed to work. However, even that was a bit odd: if the applet wasn't open but a different applet with a different BundleID was open, the first time I click an http link brought that other applet to the front, rather than launching the correct one. \nSo, long story short: I'm not sure I have a perfect solution for this, but perhaps RCDefaultApp will help you get it working in a way that works for you. \n\nA: You can do this with Platypus by registering it as URI scheme handler for http and https.\nFor details see this answer.\n", "Q: How to make a bootable OS X Yosmite USB from Yosemite 10.10.3.dmg file I have downloaded this installer from a torrent site and not from the MacAppStore because it was slow to download followed the advice here but couldn't do because the installer is in DMG format not in .App format.\nCould any please tell me how to do it?\n\nA: See How to make a bootable OS X 10.10 Yosemite install drive at macworld.com.\nOption 2 worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the Yosemite installer on your Mac. It’s called Install OS X Yosemite.app and it should have been downloaded to your main Applications folder (/Applications).\n\n*Right-click (or Control+click) the installer, and choose Show Package Contents from the resulting contextual menu.\n\n*In the folder that appears, open Contents, then open Shared Support; you’ll see a disk image file called InstallESD.dmg.\n\n*Double-click InstallESD.dmg in the Finder to mount its volume. That volume will appear in the Finder as OS X Install ESD; open it to view its contents.\n\n*Several of the files you’ll need to work with are hidden in the Finder, and you need to make them visible. Open the Terminal app (in /Application/Utilities), then type (or copy and paste) the following command, and then press Return:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder\n\n(This tells the Finder to show hidden files—we’ll re-hide such files later.)\n\n*Launch Disk Utility (in /Applications/Utilities) and then drag BaseSystem.dmg (in the OS X Install ESD volume) into Disk Utility’s left-hand sidebar.\n\n*Select BaseSystem.dmg in Disk Utility’s sidebar, and then click the Restore button in the main part of the window.\n\n*Drag the BaseSystem.dmg icon into the Source field on the right (if it isn’t already there).\n\n*Connect to your Mac the properly formatted hard drive or flash drive you want to use for your bootable Yosemite installer.\n\n*In Disk Utility, find this destination drive in the left sidebar. You may see a couple partitions under the drive: one named EFI and another with the name you see for the drive in the Finder. Drag the latter—the one with the drive name—into the Destination field on the right. (If the destination drive has additional partitions, just drag the partition you want to use as your bootable installer volume.)\n\n*Warning: This step will erase the destination drive or partition, so make sure that it doesn’t contain any valuable data. Click Restore, and then click Erase in the dialog box that appears; if prompted, enter an admin-level username and password.\n\n*Wait for the restore procedure to finish, which should take just a few minutes.\n\n*Open the destination drive—the one you’re using for your bootable installer drive, which has been renamed OS X Base System. Inside that drive, open the System folder, and then open the Installation folder. You’ll see an alias called Packages. Delete that alias.\n\n*Open the mounted OS X Install ESD volume, and you’ll see a folder called Packages. Drag that folder into the Installation folder on your destination drive. (You're replacing the deleted Packages alias with this Packages folder.) The folder is about 4.6GB in size, so the copy will take a bit of time, especially if you’re copying to a slow thumb drive.\n\n*Also in the mounted OS X Install ESD volume, you’ll find files named BaseSystem.chunklist and BaseSystem.dmg. Copy these files to the root (top) level of your install drive (OS X Base System, not into the System or Installation folder).\n\n*Eject the OS X Install ESD volume.\nYou’ll likely want to re-hide invisible files in the Finder. Open the Terminal app, type (or copy and paste) the following command, and then press Return:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0 && killall Finder\n\nYou now have a bootable Yosemite install drive. If you like, you can rename the drive from OS X Base System to something more descriptive, such as Yosemite Installer.\n\nA: Show hidden files in a folder...just TOGGLE IT ON...\nUse Command+Shift and press \".\" (Period)\n", "Q: How to backup/export photos/videos from the new Photos app to an external hard disk?

I do this to be able to have a shared file base of original photos synced by dropbox, and all sharing users can have their own copy of Photos.app use that as a base for referenced photos. \nIt attempts to avoid overwriting photos with the same name, by first verifying if a non-identical file exists at the same path already.\nAlso, it sets the timestamp of the newly made folders to the date of the events they have. Nice to sort events by date in finder or whatever, although the folder names already start with the date (because if you copy them elsewhere, timestamps may change anyway).\nIt is compatible with single quotes in album names.

And you'll export the original unedited versions of your photos i.e. you'll lose the edits.\n\n\n*Photos to Disk has been demised. It was great until Mojave but broke on Catalina because of changes in Photos database structure. There's a new app in Mac App Store named Photos Takeout that works on High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina and Big Sur.\n\n\n*Photos Takeout exports items stored locally (in the Photos Library on the Mac), externally (referenced files) or in the iCloud Photos Library.\n\nA: If you simply want the entire Masters structure copied to a new drive, then \n\n\n*\n\n*first find your iPhoto or Photos Library file.

You can copy that to anywhere.\nIt is sorted into years, then months. Not all contained folders will actually be populated, if old photos were ever deleted, the file structure remains.\nAs pointed out in comments, if you need the copied structure to be readable natively on Windows, then you ought to format the target disk as ExFAT.\nWindows cannot natively read Mac OS Extended disks & would need 3rd party support.\n\nA: Photos To Disk claims to do exactly this:\n\nUsing Photos To Disk you can retrieve your original photos and videos (including photos in RAW file format) from your Photo Library in just a few easy steps.\nYou can customize your folder structure to group your media files by year, month or day. For albums, Photos To Disk uses the folder structure defined in Photos.\nMedia files can be renamed after the titles that you have eventually defined in Photos. You can also prefix file names with media dates or media dates/hours.\nMetadata (Title, Description, Location, Keywords, Adjusted Date and Time) can be embedded into JPEG, PNG, TIFF and PSD image files or stored in XMP sidecar files for other image file formats (e.g. RAW).\n\n\nA: There is an excellent Apple Script from https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7641108?start=0&tstart=0\nset dest to \"/Users/me/Desktop/export/\" as POSIX file as text -- the destination folder (use a valid path)\n\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    with timeout of 180000 seconds\n        repeat with i in albums\n            set tFolder to dest & (get name of i)\n            my makeFolder(tFolder) -- create a folder named (the name of this album) in dest\n            export (get media items of i) to (tFolder as alias) without using originals\n        end repeat\n    end timeout\nend tell\n\non makeFolder(tPath)\n    do shell script \"mkdir -p \" & quoted form of POSIX path of tPath\nend makeFolder\n\n", "Q: Safari, Yosemite: Where is \"Reopen all windows from last session\" stored?

Checking Facebook and Twitter, browsing to read unproductive things, etc. I should just stop, but I'm curious if there is a technological deterrent to my habit.\nI suspect that an unlock delay would be perfect. If I knew that my phone would take 30 or 60 seconds to unlock, then I would be significantly less likely to pick up my phone at all, when I don't need anything. I need to have my phone near me and on for work, but I would like it if the time-wasting aspects of my phone were less convenient.\nIs there any sort of setting or app that could help with this?\n\nA: There's no setting to delay the unlock, but what you could do is go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, switch off Use Touch ID for iPhone Unlock, and then switch off Simple Passcode.\nSwitching off Use Touch ID for iPhone Unlock will disable your fingerprint's ability to unlock your phone, and switching off Simple Passcode will make you write a passcode that can be any length you want, with any characters you want.

Everything seems ok, except that the HDD does not appear.\nAny idea why?\n\nA: On my MacBooks over Wifi, the HDD attached to the Airport does not mount in the same way as directly connected or even NAS drives. Rather than the drive, I get the Airport Extreme in the 'Shared' section of Finder. Selecting the Airport Extreme shows the drive as a folder, and opening that folder effectively 'mounts' it.

From the terminal I create a hard link to this file in another directory with the command \nln myfile.txt ~/Documents/folder2\n\nThe new file appears as expected in folder2. When I examine the inode for each file using ls -i, it gives the same number, as expected. However, if I open the file and modify it in folder1, after saving, if I open the file from folder2 it has no data. Investigating the inode numbers with ls -i, the two files now have different inode numbers. So my question is, why is this happening? Is this the behavior I should be expecting? My understanding was that hard links were truly indistinguishable files, merely alternate names for the same data. Thus I would expect that altering the file after opening in one location wouldn't be any different than had I opened it from the other location. Can anyone explain what is going on here?\nIn event that it matters, I'm using Mavericks and the default terminal.app.\nSome additional information. The described behavior happened when the file was edited with either TeXShop or TextEdit, so I thought it was something at the OS level. However it appears to not happen when I edit the file with Aquamacs. \n\nA: A friend of mine found the answer for me. Apparently OS X has a function writeToFile:atomically, which causes a copy of the edited file to be made, then, on saving, replacing the original file with the copy. Since the copy exists in a different place in the hard disk, it has a different inode number. So after the save, the opened file points to a new location and the data at the original inode is removed. This causes the other copy of the file to now point to nothing at the original inode location.\n", "Q: OS X cd command in /usr/bin instead of /bin On OS X 10.8 I was looking at my /bin folder and found that cd was not there, but rather in the /usr/bin folder. Why is that? From the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. I know that /bin should contain essential binaries, i.e. those required when no other filesystems are mounted. Is cd not essential enough? (by the way, it appears the \"su\" command is also in /usr/bin). Now, I know that OS X doesn't follow strictly the FHS, but is there a reason for these different location of binaries?\n\nA: cd is a shell builtin, and has to be a builtin to work. If it were executed as a normal command, it'd run as a subprocess, change that subprocess's directory, and then exit... having no effect at all on the parent shell's directory.\nAs for su: the fondamental distinction between /bin and /usr/bin is that /usr/bin might be on a different filesystem from the root, and hence not be available early in the boot process; thus /bin (and /sbin) must contain all of the commands needed early in the boot process. On OS X, su apparently isn't needed during boot.\n", "Q: How can I use Automator to open a website & log in everyday at a certain time?

I would like to do something similar to how you can delete all user data on an iPhone i.e. without having to format the disk and re-install the OS.\nTo be clear, I do not want to save anything from the Mac, but purely to restore it to \"factory fresh\" state.\n\nA: For the OSX factory reset, backup all your data, then restart your Mac and hold down Command + R key. Use Disk Utility to erase the hard drive. Click on Disk Utility > Continue. Select the main volume and click Unmount then Erase. Quit Disk Utility. Click Reinstall OS X and Continue.

I'm guessing your're not seeing the input options because your microphone jack doesn't have three rings on it (Apple headsets with microphone have three rings)? If that's the case, you'll need to get a splitter cable so that the Mac realises that a microphone is available.

I recently received an old iMac secondhand.  I have no way to reach the original owner. I am trying to upgrade the OS software, but the prompts demand the administrator's name (which is auto-filled) and password (which I do not have).  I understand why these security features are in place, but is there any way in the world for me to access Admin. privileges without the password?\n\nA: You can boot from installation media and use that to reset your password. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from installation media, or, if the Mac OS version is recent enough, from internet recovery.\n\n*Once in the installer, Utilities --> Reset Password will allow you to reset the password of the administrator user.\n\n\nSee this link for more information, including instructions on how to perform the reset without an installation disk.\nOnce the password is reset, you can perform an OS upgrade. Of course, as this is a second-hand machine, you may be better off doing a reinstall (in which case, just reinstall and don't bother resetting the administrator password first).\n\nA: I don't think that's possible, at least not through the official App Store software update. If you don't have a password, and you have an install disk, CD or flash drive, you should be able to reformat the disk and reinstall a fresh copy, in which you would lose all your data. You can back up any files you need to another disk, and then manually copy the files back to the fresh install.

How can I set the HTML entry without setting the styled Clipboard text entry.\nI have tried several approaches. For example, I have tried to set the clipboard to only contain a string and a HTML entry, but still the extra entry is included. I have also tried to set the styled Clipboard text entry to the empty string but that also set all the plain-text entries to the empty string as well.\nI don't think the pbcopy command line tool is powerful enough to do this, as it set the clipboard to a new value.\nWhile I'm currently using applescript to do this, I'm open to using any tool available, preferably a scriptable one (so that I don't have to ask the users to perform a compilation).\n\nA: After some investigation I found that you can manipulate the Pasteboard from Python, without having it introduce the styled Clipboard text entry. I reimplemented the ruby/applescript module in Python, so now I can copy syntax highlighted text from Emacs and paste it either into dumb applications like the terminal window or applications that can handle formatted text, like Pages.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro running Tiger 10.4 erase start up disk I do not have the original disks but the computer has been upgraded to Snow Leopard.

But depending on different WLANs I use (public/university/home), this seems to be a different name for my own Mac Book Pro.\nHow is this name set? Could I define a fixed host name for my Mac or is this not possible?\n\nA: First, you need to set your system name in System Preferences > Sharing > Computer Name. Let's assume for now that you set it to MyComputerName.\nThe next step is to make sure your computer name is not overridden by DHCP client (which is normally what happens and what you have observed - each time a DHCP server assigns and IP address to your computer, your mac will use the hostname associated with that IP address as its own).\nTo do that, you need to, in Terminal.app change the content of the /etc/hostconfig file, adding something similar to this: \nHOSTNAME=\"MyComputerName\"\n\nwhere MyComputerName is a text string corresponds to the host name you set in System Preferences. \nIf you ever need to set it to change the hostname automatically based on the address received from the DHCP server, you can either remove this line from the /etc/hostconfig file or change it's value to -AUTOMATIC- instead of the \"MyComputerName\". \nFinally, in bash you use \\h as the host name token - so e.g. you can set your PS1 to:\nPS1='[\\u@\\h \\w] ' \n\n", "Q: Seagate expansion drive 2TB not recognized on windows after mac After i connected my seagate expansion drive to my macbook air, it opened normally as  far as  i remember\nBut now if i'm connecting it on windows 7, it shows that driver installation and the option for ejection, but it doesnt show it on my computer\nSo, has the mac made any changes on it?\n\nA: Try downloading the driver directly from the Seagate site before plugging it back into your windows computer.\n\nA: You should install the latest driver on your Win 7, then the connection should be ok.\n", "Q: How to reinstall OSX on a Macbook Air whose screen is broken, and OS has been erased?

Never tried this, so YMMV.\nTry putting your broken Macbook in Target Disk Mode (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH10725?locale=en_US) and connect it up to the working Macbook. I'm reasonably certain Target Disk Mode is a firmware thing so you should be able to get it working without an OS. You'll know if that part works if the drive appears on the working Mac.\nFrom there, you should be able to install an OS on the target disk from the working Macbook.\nBut, and this is a big one: For this to potentially not end badly, the working Macbook MUST be the exact same model with the same stats as your broken Macbook.

I need to be on both at the same time.\nI want to be able to accept connections from the office LAN, but I want to limit access to many of those services from the WiFi network. The clickable System Preferences for the firewall don't give me anything more powerful than \"Allow Incoming Connections\" which allows connections over all interfaces.\nWhere do I go to get more control over the firewall? Any tips for getting this config right?\nThis is not an issue of getting WiFi and Ethernet to work at the same time. They already work like I want them to. It's about firewalling-off services from certain interfaces, something that is not available in the standard System Preferences control panel.\n\nA: OS X's firewall is very comprehensive, but it's GUI is limited, it can do what you want, but it's somewhat complex. I would try the following this guide http://www.techrepublic.com/article/configure-apples-built-in-network-firewall-with-icefloor/\nFor more advanced support you'd probably have more luck asking over on Server Fault (StackExchange) rather than here as it starts getting into the system and networking level stuff rather than OS X specifically.\n", "Q: Unable to retrieve deleted iPhone contacts My contacts were linked to an iCloud.com account and not my gmail.com account. I only created an Apple ID with my gmail account and have no idea how that iCloud.com account was created. Now my contacts got deleted and I only have the password for my gmail.com account but my contacts are not synced to that account. My contacts are synced to the iCloud.com account and I don't have the password for that account.\n\nA: Your iCloud account was probably something you created when you bought the phone or updated. It's part of the Find My iPhone feature that prevents your phone from being used by someone else if it's stolen.\nYou need to regain access to your iCloud account, using http://iforgot.apple.com is a good start to reset your password.\nYou should check your iPhone Settings app in iCloud to see if Find My iPhone is enabled, if it is you will not be able to disable this without the password, and if you ever have to restore the phone again you will require this password.\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone app that lets you post to Twitter and Facebook Pages as yourself? I am looking for an iOS app that lets you spot status updates (tweets) to both Twitter and a Facebook Page (not my personal Facebook profile, but one of the Pages that I administer).

To do that, I need to click somewhere on the URL, reposition my cursor over the newly-left-aligned address, and then click again to place the insertion point.\nIs there a way to get Safari to display URLs left-aligned all the time?\n\nA: Not sure it's exactly what you want, but  Cmd ⌘   L  will select & left align, same as if you'd clicked it - so you could do it as you're mousing towards it.\n\nA: This was irritating me also - I kept clicking on the padlock by accident and the security cert kept popping up.\nIn the end - I just changed the settings to show the full URL- therefore the link was generally taking up the full bar.

I have both files on my laptop\n\nA: Each of them comes with their own advantages.\nAdvantages of Photo Stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does not use your iCloud storage\n\n*Only stores your most recent 1000 photos or the last 30 days of images\n\n*Does not upload and sync videos\n\n\nOn the other hand, here is the advantages of iCloud Photo Library:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stores all your photos and personal video\n\n*Uses your iCloud storage\n\n*Stores full-resolution photos\n\n\nIf you want to see a good article about the whole difference, you can check this link.\n\nA: Photostream will use an internet connection and copy photos to your other computers/devices so you have a backup that way and they are available on other devices that way. I actually use Photostream to save photos from my iPhone to my computer (I periodically move them from the Photostream folder on my computer to different folders and then I can delete them from my phone). It's not limited to 1000 that way if it's on your computer. Unfortunately Photostream does not transfer/sync your videos though, so I have to copy those off manually, argh.\niCloud has served primarily as a backup, and now there is an iCloud Photo Sharing which allows you to have better access to the photos thru the cloud, also from your various devices. It uses your iCloud storage capacity so you might run out if you have a lot of photos on your device (I think most people will end up using more than the 5GB you get for free). My method above for clearing out my phone of older photos allows me to not go over my free storage in iCloud. One advantage to iCloud is that your phone will smartly not store the full photo file and instead store one sized for your device saving space on your device. However if you want to do edits and use the photo for other things, it's always best to work from the original larger size.\nI have to admit, this stuff is getting really confusing. People probably end up buying more iCloud storage pretty often just because they don't know what else to do and their device keeps saying they are out of iCloud space. My advice is to figure out one way that works for you and know it and stick with it.\n", "Q: Paste tool for OSX There is paste tool in Linux but have not found for OSX. \nIts name was probably dpaste or something in Linux.\nAssume you run xxd -ps r328.raw |  head -n2430 and you want to paste it to your friend. \nIt will be difficult to paste it to him. \nOf course, I can store it into file but I want to get it to my clipboard.\nHow can you get paste thing to your clipboard?\n\nA: man pbcopy\npbcopy  takes  the  standard input and places it in the specified\npasteboard.

Try this:\nsay \"the company [[slnc 1200]]\" using \"Alex\" saving to ((path to home folder as string) & \"TheCompany.aiff\")\n\nNote that you have to use the AIFF format, which iPods do support.

I'll open the phone up later and it will work again. Any suggestions on a fix? \n\nA: There is nothing that can fix this other than hardware service, it's greyed out because the Wi-Fi module is not functioning correctly, it is intermittent now but will eventually fail entirely.\nYour best course of action if you are under warranty is to take it to Apple, however this model is unlikely to be under the 1 year warranty, or 2 year AppleCare warranty.\nIn this case, if all of these apply to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bought the phone in the EU.\n\n*Are the original purchaser of the unit.\n\n*Bought for consumer use, not business\n\n*Bought from Apple Online or an Apple Store\n\n\nThen you can make a claim under EU Consumer Law which states a device should last a reasonable amount of time, however you are typically required to demonstrate this within the first 6 months. However this issue was a common failure mode for this product so I would suggest that it's a known issue to Apple and they should replace it under EU Consumer Law on the basis it is a known issue.\nIf one or more of the above don't apply or Apple refuses, then there is no option but a handset replacement, I wouldn't personally attempt a logic board replacement using parts online, it's a particularly complex repair.\nSource: 6+ years working at Apple Retail\n", "Q: Software to organize library?

I want it to be the default app for opening .csv files.\nFirst, I tried to open a .csv file using the \"Open With\" dialog.  LOV is not an offered option, so I clicked on \"Other\" and there it is but it is ghosted until I go from \"Recommended Applications\" to \"All Applications\". \nThat should be it, but I then get this error message (I think from \"Gatekeeper\"):\nIf I go into Security Preferences I can make it \"Open Anyway\", but the next time I try to open a .csv file I get the same error.\nHow do I set up my Mac so double-clicking on a .csv file will have it open in LibreOffice?\nUpdate: I found a procedure (described as an answer below) that will make LibreOffice the default app for ONE .csv file, but I have to go through the same steps (add LibreOffice to \"Open With\" and tell Gatekeeper to \"Open Anyway\") for every .csv file that has not had this done.\nSo how do I set up OS X so that double-clicking on any .csv file will have it open in LibreOffice?\n\nA: I had the same problem and finally managed to fix it.\nSimply adding 'Libreoffice Vanilla' by doing a right click on a csv file and choosing that app did not remember this for all csv files, as you state.\nI was able to configure it by going to the info of a single csv file (mac button & i or rightclick and 'Get Info'). Open the 'Open with' apps list and you'll probably need to choose the 'Other' option at the bottom. Choose the 'All Application' selection and 'Always Open With' option while finding the Libreoffice app in the list and confirm that selection.\nNow you'll have to click the 'Change all' button right under the App selection combo box on the general file info window. This step ensured all other csv files to open using Libreoffice from then on.\n\nA: Gatekeeper has no bearing on what app is allowed to open what documents. An easy work-around is to Option-click on the app and choose Open which should cause Gatekeeper to register it as you wanting to override it. (You could also try this on the csv file in question, it may force a Gatekeeper override there too.)\n\nA: Update: Added this answer because I thought I'd found the solution (see next paragraph) but it turns out that only fixes it for the ONE .csv file you \"train\" it with.  Still have the same issue when I try to make it open any other .csv file. \n\nOK, I think this was a conflation of several issues.  I just downloaded an update to LibreOffice Vanilla where the first fix was \"Clicking on files in Finder opens the file in LibreOffice now\".  So I sorta think that was part of the confusion.\nNow that that part of LibreOffice was working, I went through the right-click \"Open With\" process I described originally followed by the \"Open Anyway\" in Security Preferences.  That seemed to make LibreOffice the default app for .csv.  Then I double-clicked on a .csv file and got the same error message, so I repeated the \"Open Anyway\" in Security Preferences.\nThat seems to have done the trick: double-clicking on .csv files makes them open in LibreOffice without any issues now.\n\nA: You could try setting LibreOffice as the default application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Under the Apple Menu select System Preferences... \n\n*Select Default Apps \n\n*Locate CSV in the list \n\n*In the drop-down set the default application to LibreOffice.  If it is not listed in the drop-down list select Other... from the list and locate it in Applications.\n\n\n\n", "Q: USB Flash drive not mounting OS X Some months ago I bought a USB flash drive 16 GB, and I have used it on my Windows machine with no errors or bugs, whatsoever.\nSince that I need to move some files from my Mac, the flash drive does not\nappear to be mounting in OS X at all.\nWhen I run in diskutil list in Terminal, the flash drive does not appear, not even in Disk Utility.\n\nI am starting to think that maybe something is wrong with the stick?

No other devices are affected while this is happening and I can fix it by restarting the machine.\nI know there are issues with Wi-Fi after upgrading to Yosemite, but this was brand new with Yosemite already installed. The Wi-Fi settings were imported through iCloud if that makes any difference.\n\nA: The issues aren't with upgrading to Yosemite, they're with a component of Yosemite - every Yosemite machine runs the risk of having them. The issue's been resolved in the latest version of the OS X 10.10.4 beta, which you can download by joining the Apple beta program and following the instructions to put the beta on your computer.\nHere's an article explaining more about the bug in question, if you're interested.\n\nA: Delete your network settings in System Preferences and starting over usually solves this problem. To check, create a new \"Location\" in System Preferences > Network, and enter your password to connect to your Wi-Fi network. \nYou can then try deleting the stored Wi-Fi information just for that network by setting \"Location:\" to \"Automatic,\" clicking Wi-Fi in the left field, clicking \"Advanced,\" and finding your network on that list. \nIf you see no improvement, continue deleting saved Wi-Fi Preferred Networks until you do.

They said the old one checked out ok even though I did their tests at home before I sent it in. When trying to install the new one, the only way I could get it to show up was by using an old DVD of Snow Leopard (major reason why I like to have software on disk!). Yosemite didn't cut it. I got the Disk recognized and began to update it to Yosemite and update all my software. Then all the sudden the OSX crashed and I couldn't find my disk again. I have tried Disk Utility, Cmd R, Option,etc. with no luck. I even tried using Apple Hardware Test, but it's a Catch 22! My Mac Pro 2008 is suppose to have it on the 2nd DVD, but Yosemite says it no longer works with PCIntel or somthing and this system also doesn't have the holding down \"D\" key at start up control. \nThis last time I did an OS X re-install my system just went and switched over to my internal disk and I keep getting a message that my Mercury Accelsior ejected improperly. Another weird thing is that my new External Hard drive goes with it at the same time, but my older hard drive (also connected through one of the two eSata ports on the Mercury Accelsior stays connected? \nSo, I am at a complete loss. All the things I've been told to try, if they even work, has only been temporary at best and this has been going on for 2-3 weeks with no suggestion working.\n\nA: When updating to Yosemite you will want to make sure that you are at least running 10.6.8. Running the early versions of 10.6 when updating to Yosemite, will cause errors.\nYou will also want to make sure that the TRIM has been disabled.

For example, add to your .bashrc:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/grep/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\n\nI had to do the above on my mac when after brew upgrade my grep was no longer accessible (it was installed previously with brew install grep --with-default-names, and this option is not available any more).\nThis solution works as of Homebrew 2.1.1:\nbrew --version\nHomebrew 2.1.1\nHomebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 5afdd; last commit 2019-04-22)\nHomebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision a5a206; last commit 2019-04-22)\n\nThis answer is based on the one from nohillside, with comments from Jonathan Komar and scott m gardner.\n\nA: GNU grep is not part of coreutils. To install, run\nbrew install grep\n\nAs with coreutils, this doesn't automatically replace the existing grep\n==> Caveats\nAll commands have been installed with the prefix \"g\".\nIf you need to use these commands with their normal names, you\ncan add a \"gnubin\" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:\n  PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/grep/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\n\nSo after installing you can either use ggrep, gegrep and gfgrep; or extend PATH as shown above to use grep etc. The second option may confuse some macOS specific scripts though in case the options differ.\n", "Q: How to export Calibre's library for Database Support?

I am new to OS X and am thinking of purchasing an app from the app store (in this case it's SkySafari 4 Pro). If I purchase this app, or any app, will I be able to use it on, say, my iPad? If the answer depends on the app, how do I find out if this is the case?\nI had a look at the Macbook App Store FAQ page, which says:\n\nMac App Store can only be used on a Mac\n\nThis seems to imply that the answer is no, but even so I'm somewhat confused about the relationship between the different App stores, and how my decision to purchase an app on device X affects my rights to then download it on device Y (where X might be a macbook and Y might be an iPad or vice-versa).\n\nA: It's not a question of licensing, it's that the architecture of the Mac & an iDevice are totally different.\nThe Mac runs on an Intel processor, OS X is based on a unix kernel.\niDevices run on an ARM processor, iOS is [actually idk, but proprietary]\n(All iDevices run on the same 'family' of processors, so that is why if you purchase an iApp, you can use it on any iDevice you own.)\nApps for one simply cannot run on the other.  \nSome apps are made in 2 or more versions, for Mac, iPhone, iPad, even Windows or Android etc, each available from their respective Store.   \nThe App Store 'app' on the Mac is only for Mac Apps. iApps can be purchased either from the App Store on the iDevice, or through iTunes on a Mac/PC.\nThe licensing model for Apple is that the Apple ID used to purchase an app from the App Store is allowed to use it on any device they own using that Apple ID  [1] [so long as it will physically run, as explained above]\nThis makes moving from machine to machine easy, but not from ID to ID.\nIt's pretty much the opposite of the Microsoft model, where an app, or even the OS itself is tied to one machine, using a serial number etc.\n [1]with some exceptions which you can see noted in the Purchases tab in the App Store app.\nAn example…\n\nInterestingly, the only apps I have that are not shareable are all Freeware anyway, so I could simply re-\"purchase\" if I needed them on another machine.\nFamily Sharing extends that licensing model to other members of your family, so all can access the same songs, albums, movies, TV shows, books, and apps on both Mac and iDevices, if they wish, from a single 'purchase'.\n", "Q: Autocorrect for specific people and the language they use I don't think this option exists, but doesn't hurt to ask.

It would simply amazing if my devices and apps (Mail, Messages, Skype, etc) would recognize who I am writing to and remember what autocorrect language I had set up for them.\nThat way, it would always autocorrect the appropriate language without me having to switch it. (On the actual Mac, switching the languages is not even an easy step).\nI hope there is some solution in the meantime other than just turning autocorrect off.. :)\n\nA: When editing text, right click and choose \"Show Spelling and Grammar\":\n\nSelect Automatic by Language:\n\nThis works for me, I use two languages (English and Italian).\nEdit: This is for Spelling and Grammar, the setting for autocorrect is in Keyboard->Text:\n\nYou'll also have to add the languages you will use in the Languge & Region panel of System Preferences.\n", "Q: USB-Stick (Format: FAT) retaining incomplete files I'm having a problem deleting files from a USB-Stick, which is formatted with FAT.\nI tried transferring files from my Mac to the USB-Stick, and if I remember correctly, removed it from the USB-port before it finished transferring the files. Therefore some files weren't transferred entirely, resulting in this:\n\nThe three bottom folders haven't been transferred completely, hindering me from accessing them. The top two folders contain files, which weren't transferred entirely.\nIf I try to delete the folders, by simply selecting them and pressing ⌘⌫ it deletes them for about a second, but then they return.\nI have tried formatting the USB-Stick:\n\n...but I get the following error:\n\n\nDeletion of the following medium has failed\n  Following error has occurred, while trying to delete the following medium:\n  The medium couldn't be deactivated.\n\n\nIs there any way I can delete the entire content, so I have a completely clear USB-Stick?\n\nA: It seems as if Disk Utility can't lock the device. This is usually because some other process has open handles on a mount point that resides on the drive. As it's an USB pen drive, I guess you already tried plugging and reinserting it. Thing is: As soon as it gets mounted, something immediately seems to request a lock. This MIGHT be Finder. If you want to know which process is responsible for this, execute sudo lsof /Volumes/Stick from terminal. This shows you all open handles and their respective owners affecting /Volumes/Stick.\nTry disabling auto mount. Unfortunately it's a bit complicated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your supposedly faulty stick. Open a terminal and wait until Finder recognizes the drive.\n\n*Enter mount. You will see something like\n/dev/disk3s1 on /Volumes/Stick (exfat, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners). Note down the first part which refers to the device and the first part in brackets, in this example /dev/disk3s1 and exfat, the filesystem on that drive.\n\n*Run diskutil info <device> | grep \"Volume UUID\" in terminal, where <device> must be replaced with the device you noted down in the second step, so you'll end up with something like diskutil info /dev/disk3s1 | grep \"Volume UUID\".\n\n*The output of this command is a UUID. It should read something like Volume UUID:              03D819D9-49E0-387E-AC9E-2CB54BF0DDD9\n\n*Now unplug your USB drive and run sudo vifs. If you are not used to vi you want to put a EDITOR=nano afterwards. Edit the last line of the file making it read UUID=<UUID> none <filesystem> noauto, e.g. UUID=03D819D9-49E0-387E-AC9E-2CB54BF0DDD9 none exfat noauto. Exit the editor.\n\n*Now plug it back in. If you done the steps correctly, the drive won't be mounted automatically. \n\n*Try to format it again using Disk Utility.\n\n", "Q: How can I reformat a USB I used by USB to add as iso file into it.\nsudo dd bs=4m if=my.iso of=/dev/disk1\n\nNow I want to get the USB back to normal. but the erase button in Disk Utility is disabled. How can I reformat this\n\nA: The following page has a lot of explanation on it but I've provided the quick steps below. Side note, try verify and repair and fix permissions in the app first to see if that does it. \nErase disk via terminal\nStart in terminal with this command:\ndiskutil list\nNext verify and repair the usb drive with this command putting the disk name I where it says {volume name} (no brackets):\ndiskutil verifyVolume /Volumes/{volume name} diskutil repairVolume /Volumes/{volume name}\nIf good so far, try erasing with this command, replacing disk identifier with the name from the list in the first step (eg disk2):\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Test /dev/{disk identifier}\n", "Q: How to resize an image in Keynote or Pages?

That means that muting the internal speaker before plugging in headphones should be enough to stop audio from playing through the speaker if you disconnect your headphones.\nIf you want to keep the speaker disabled even if you hit any volume controls, you can use Soundflower. It's an extension designed to let your Mac record its own audio output, which it does by creating virtual input and output options that feed directly into each other. That means that you can hold down Option, click on the volume icon in the menu bar, and select one of the Soundflower options as your audio output before plugging in your headphones and selecting them as the output device. If your headphones get disconnected, your audio output will default to Soundflower, which doesn't send anything through the speaker. To re-enable the speaker, just Option-click on the volume icon in the menu bar and choose the built-in speaker for output.\n\nA: I don't have a Macbook, so I'm guessing if this will work, based on my Mac Pro, however…\nIn Audio MIDI Setup [Applications > Utilities]\nAudio Devices ( Cmd ⌘   1  if it doesn't open automatically)\nyou can set the input & output volume for each individual audio-capable device.\nSetting Speaker volume to zero, or checking the Mute box, whilst leaving headphones at standard volume might do what you need.\n\n", "Q: Developer Account Renewal - what happens if you don't renew?

I need to export all contents in a WhatsApp chat, going back several months, including lots of audio and other media. This is for legal reasons, thus I absolutely need each and every element in the conversation. WhatsApp is running on a iPhone 5s, the phone is synchronized with iTunes on a Windows PC, and all elements in the chat have never been deleted.\nI tried using WhatsApp's \"email chat\" function, but it skipped several media, probably due to message size limits (the email was exactly 10 MB); unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an option in WhatsApp to split the log into multiple emails.\nI have an iTunes backup and I can perform an iCloud backup; however, I don't know how to extract WhatsApp data from them.

Performed a clean install as i erased my HD from Recovery HD before installing the software.\nYosemite is being downloaded since a few hours but it would be the same with the USB Installer as Recovery HD is an Installer too.\nSo in both cases you need internet.\nAm i right or wrong?\n\nA: A bootable drive saves the entire OS X installer locally. If your current reinstall were happening from a bootable drive, the \"downloading Yosemite\" step would be nonexistent because everything's already there.\nAs in, you're wrong. The specific benefit of a bootable drive is the ability to reinstall OS X without needing to download it on the spot. (Of course, first you needed to have downloaded the OS X installer and run through the bootable drive-making procedure at some point beforehand, but the point is that once you've done that one download, you've got it for whenever you need it.)\n", "Q: What happens to iCloud mail if storage payment fails I'm thinking of switching to iCloud Email and to buy more storage (currently 5gb) but im not sure if it's reliable to be charged for the storage on a monthly basis.

To achieve this, it has the following concepts:\n\n\n*\n\n*File system protection\n\n*Kernel extension protection\n\n*Runtime protection\n\n\nFile system protection\nSIP prevents parties other than Apple from adding, deleting or modifying directories and files stored in certain directories:\n/bin\n/sbin\n/usr\n/System\n\nApple has indicated that the following directories are available for developers to access:\n/usr/local\n/Applications\n/Library\n~/Library\n\nAll directories in /usr except for /usr/local are protected by SIP.\nIt is possible to add, remove or change SIP-protected files and directories via an installer package which is signed by Apple's own certificate authority. This allows Apple to make changes to SIP-protected parts of the OS without needing to change the existing SIP protections. \nThe certificate authority in question is reserved by Apple for their own use; Developer ID-signed installer packages are not able to alter SIP-protected files or directories.\nTo define which directories are protected, Apple has currently defined two configuration files on the filesystem. The primary one is found at the location below:\n/System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf\n\nwhere rootless.conf lists all the applications and the top-level of directories which SIP is protecting.\n\nApplications\nSIP is protecting the core apps which OS X installs into Applications and Applications Utilities. This means it will no longer be possible to delete the applications which OS X installs, even from the command line when using root privileges.\n\n\nDirectories\nSIP is also protecting a number of directories and symlinks outside of /Applications and the top level of those directories are also listed in rootless.conf. \n\nIn addition to protections, Apple has also defined some exceptions to SIP's protection in the rootless.conf file, and those exceptions are marked with asterixes. These exemptions from SIP's protection mean that it is possible to add, remove or change files and directories within those locations.\n\nAmong those exceptions are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/User Template - where OS X stores the template\ndirectories it uses when creating home folders for new accounts.\n\n*/usr/libexec/cups - where OS X stores printer configuration\ninformation\n\n\nApple considers this file theirs and that any third parties' changes to it will be overwritten by Apple.\nTo see which files have been protected by SIP, use the ls command with dash capital O in Terminal:\nls -O\n\nSIP-protected files will be labeled as restricted.\n\nOne important think to know is that even if a symlink is protected by SIP, that does not necessarily mean that the directory they're linking to is being protected by SIP. At the root level of an OS X El Capitan boot drive, there are several SIP-protected symlinks pointing to directories stored inside the root-level directory named private.\nHowever, when the contents of the private directory are examined, the directories which those symlinks point to are not protected by SIP and both they and their contents can be moved, edited or changed by processes using root privileges.\n\nIn addition to the list of SIP exceptions which Apple has set in rootless.conf, there is a second list of SIP exceptions. This list includes a number of directories and application names for third-party products. Similar to rootless.conf, this exclusion list is Apple's and any third parties' changes to it will be overwritten by Apple.\n/System/Library/Sandbox/Compatibility.bundle/Contents/Resources/paths\n\nRuntime protection\nSIP's protections are not limited to protecting the system from filesystem changes. There are also system calls which are now restricted in their functionality.\n\n\n*\n\n*task_for_pid() / processor_set_tasks() fail with EPERM\n\n*Mach special ports are reset on exec(2)\n\n*dyld environment variables are ignored\n\n*DTrace probes unavailable\n\n\nHowever, SIP does not block inspection by the developer of their own applications while they're being developed. Xcode's tools will continue to allow apps to be inspected and debugged during the development process.\nFor more details on this, I'd recommend taking a look at Apple's developer documentation for SIP.\nKernel extension protection\nSIP blocks installation of unsigned kernel extensions. In order to install a kernel extension on OS X El Capitan with SIP enabled, a kernel extension must:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be signed with a Developer ID for Signing Kexts certificate\n\n*Install into /Library/Extensions\nIf installing an unsigned kernel extension, SIP will need to be disabled first.\nFor more information on managing SIP, please take a look at the link below:\nSystem Integrity Protection – Adding another layer to Apple’s security model\n\nA: First: the name \"rootless\" is misleading, since there's still a root account, and you can still access it (the official name, \"System Integrity Protection\", is more accurate). What it really does is limit the power of the root account, so that even if you become root, you don't have full control over the system. Essentially, the idea is that it's too easy for malware to get root access (e.g. by presenting an auth dialog to the user, which will cause the user to reflexively enter the admin password). SIP adds another layer of protection, which malware can't penetrate even if it gets root. The bad part of this, of course, it that it must also apply to things you're doing intentionally. But the restrictions it places on root aren't that bad; they don't prevent most \"normal\" system customization.\nHere's what it restricts, even from root:\n\n*\n\n*You can't modify anything in /System, /bin, /sbin, or /usr (except /usr/local); or any of the built-in apps and utilities. Only Installer and software update can modify these areas, and even they only do it when installing Apple-signed packages. But since normal OS X-style customizations go in /Library (or ~/Library, or /Applications), and unix-style customizations (e.g. Homebrew) go in /usr/local (or sometimes /etc or /opt), this shouldn't be a big deal. It also prevents block-level writes to the startup disk, so you can't bypass it that way.\nThe full list of restricted directories (and exceptions like /usr/local and a few others) is in /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf. Of course, this file is itself in a restricted area.\nWhen you upgrade to El Capitan, it moves any \"unauthorized\" files from restricted areas to /Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-(some UUID)/QuarantineRoot/.\n\n\n*You can't attach to system processes (e.g. those running from those system locations) for things like debugging (or changing what dynamic libraries they load, or some other things). Again, not too much of a big deal; developers can still debug their own programs.\nThis does block some significant things like injecting code into the built-in Apple apps (notably the Finder). It also means that dtrace-based tools for system monitoring (e.g. opensnoop) will not be able to monitor & report on many system processes.\n\n\n*You can't load kernel extensions (kexts) unless they're properly signed (i.e. by Apple or an Apple-approved developer). Note that this replaces the old system for enforcing kext signing (and the old ways of bypassing it). But since v10.10.4 Apple has had a way to enable trim support for third-party SSDs, the #1 reason to use unsigned kexts has gone away.\n\n\n*Starting in Sierra (10.12), some launchd configuration settings cannot be changed (for example, some launch daemons cannot be unloaded).\n\n\n*Starting in Mojave (10.14), access to users' personal information (email, contacts, etc) is restricted to apps that the user has approved to access that info. This is generally considered a separate feature (called Personal Information Protection, or TCC), but it's based on SIP and disabling SIP disables it as well. See: \"What and how does macOS Mojave implement to restrict applications access to personal data?\"\n\n\n*Starting in Catalina (10.15), protection of most system files is strengthened by storing them on a separate read-only volume. This is not strictly part of SIP, and is not disabled by disabling SIP. See: WWDC presentation on \"What's New in Apple [Catalina] File Systems\" and \"What's /System/Volumes/Data?\".\n\n\n*Starting in Big Sur (11.x), the read-only system volume is now a \"Sealed System Volume\" (a mounted snapshot rather than a regular volume), so making changes to it is even more complicated. See: the Eclectic Light Company article \"Big Sur boot volume layout\".\nIf you don't want these restrictions -- either because you want to modify your system beyond what this allows, or because you're developing & debugging something like kexts that aren't practical under these restrictions, you can turn SIP off. Currently this requires rebooting into recovery mode and running the command csrutil disable (and you can similarly re-enable it with csrutil enable).\nModifying the system volume in Catalina requires disabling SIP, then mounting the volume with write access (and then rebooting and turning SIP back on is recommended). In Big Sur, additional steps are required to disable authentication of the system volume before changes, and afterward create a new snapshot.\nYou can also selectively disable parts of SIP. For example, csrutil enable --without kext will disable SIP's kernel extension restriction, but leave its other protections in place.\nBut please stop and think before disabling SIP, even temporarily or partially: do you really need to disable it, or is there a better (SIP-compliant) way to do what you want? Do you really need to modify something in /System/Library or /bin or whatever, or could it go in a better place like /Library or /usr/local/bin etc? SIP may \"feel\" constraining if you aren't used to it, and there are some legitimate reasons to disable it, but a lot of what it enforces it really just best practice anyway.\nTo underscore the importance of leaving as much of SIP enabled as much of the time as possible, consider the events of September 23, 2019. Google released an update to Chrome that tried to replace the symbolic link from /var to /private/var. On most systems, SIP blocked this and there were no bad effects. On systems with SIP disabled, it rendered macOS broken and unbootable. The most common reason for disabling SIP was to load unapproved (/improperly signed) kernel extensions (specifically video drivers); if they'd only disabled the kext restriction, they would not have been affected. See the official Google support thread, a superuser Q&A on it, and an Ars Technica article.\nReferences and further info: WWDC presentation on \"Security and Your Apps\", a good explanation by Eldad Eilam on quora.com, the Ars Technica review of El Capitan, and an Apple support article on SIP, and a deep dive by Rich Trouton (who also posted an answer to this question).\n\nA: For me, it means DTrace no longer works.\nDTrace is similar to ptrace/strace in Linux, in that it allows you to see what a process is saying to the kernel. Every time a process wants to open a file, write a file, or open a port, etc, it needs to ask the kernel.\nIn Linux, this monitoring process happens outside of the kernel in \"userland\", and thus permissions are quite fine-grained. A user can monitor their own applications (to fix bugs, find memory leaks, etc) but would need to be root to monitor another user's process.\nDTrace on OSX however works at the kernel level, making it much more performant and powerful, however it requires root access to add its probes into the kernel and thus do anything. A user cannot trace their own processes without being root, but as root they can not only watch their own processes, but in fact ALL processes on the system simultaneously. For example, you can watch a file (with iosnoop) and see which process reads it. This is one of the most useful features ever for detecting malware. Because the kernel also deals with network IO, the same is true there. Wireshark detects unusual network activity, DTrace tells you the process sending the data, even if its as embedded into the system as the kernel itself.\nAs of El Capitan however, Apple has deliberately prevented DTrace from working - as in it has been specifically targeted and singled out as something SIP restricts. Why would they do this? Well, previously Apple modified their kernel and DTrace to allow some processes to opt-out of being monitored via DTrace (which upset a lot of security researchers at the time as some processes were now off limits even as root - include malware). Their reason for this was to protect DRM in apps like iTunes since theoretically someone could DTrace and grab un-DRM'd data out of the processes' memory.\nHowever, there was an important work-around that allowed the researchers to keep doing their jobs, and that was to modify the kernel to ignore this opt-out flag, so DTrace could still be used on these processes. This was actually really great because programs trying to evade detection where now lit-up with this no-DTrace flag. Anything Apple or the bad guys wanted to hide was now in plain sight...\nBut it doesn't work now, so how does this affect you?\nWell, it will affect you both directly and indirectly. Directly, it will limit your ability to monitor your system. A large number of low-level system administration and monitoring tools (which higher-level tools build upon) will no longer work. The indirect effect however will be much larger - security professionals rely on deep system access to detect the worst kinds of threats. We simply cannot do that any more. It is critical when analysing malware that it doesn't know it's running in a debugger or honeypot. Disabling SIP tells all software, from both the bad guys and Apple, that this system is being watched. No more watching the watchers. If SIP was about security they could have educated users about root - instead they removed it. Ultimately this means that Apple has replaced the 'be all and end all' security barrier of the root password, with the 'be all and end all' SIP protection mechanism. Or if your any good at social engineering, a root password with a reboot...\nThere's also this:\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro used in smoking area My late 2012 Retina MacBook Pro has been used in area's in which it was allowed to smoke. The smoke is now in the circulating system. Is there a way to clean this? The MBP is \"smoking\" now, producing old smoke smell around it.\n\nA: To start, you'll want to power off your MacBook Pro, and clean it thoroughly (but carefully) with a microfiber towel. If you do this dry, you run the risk of abrasion and scratches, but you also don't want to soak your MacBook Pro with any liquid. \nExternal Cleaning\nUse an electronics screen cleaning liquid, preferably one with an \"Apple Approved\" label. Don't use anything alcohol-based or otherwise corrosive externally, as it will damage the rubber and plastic parts. Spray the cleaner directly on the microfiber towel, not your MacBook Pro. \nMost Apple approved screen cleaning liquids leave a thin film you allow to dry, then gently polish away, not unlike wax on a car. Avoid open ports, thoroughly but gently clean the keyboard, hinge area, and speakers. These areas tend to accumulate a lot of gunk. \nInternal Cleaning\nHere's a step-by-step tear-down of the 2013 MacBook Pro. \nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18695\nIn addition to their required tools, you will need:\n• Electronics Cleaning Liquid, usually sold as \"Screen Cleaning Liquid\"\n• Microfiber Screen Cleaning Cloths\n• Electronics Cleaning Swabs (lint free Q-tips) optional\n• Paper Towels\n• 70% or (ideally) 90% Isopropyl Alcohol \n• Medium bristle toothbrush or paintbrush (optional)\nYou may want to invest in an anti-static wristband: They're inexpensive, and will save sensitive electronic parts. If you do not have one, disassemble your MacBook on a wood or metal surface, protected by a static-free towel: Microfiber works well, but only the \"smooth\" type, not the terrycloth type.\nIn Step 12 of the tear-down, you will see the fans being removed. This is optional: A good cleaning with canned air will most likely rid you of the problem. Take care not to blow the fans around too much. You won't clean them this way, and it may be bad for the motors. As an \"extreme cleaning\" option, replacing the fans will also get rid of the smell.\nTake special care in wiping out the aluminum bottom case door -- The bare aluminum door, not the electronics -- with an electronics cleaner and a microfiber cloth or paper towel. Dirt, dust and debris tends to accumulate there. \nYou can gently clean the circuit boards in your MBP with 70% or 90% Alcohol (do not use Rubbing Alcohol with high water content), but this will depend on your comfort level working with electronics. Avoid the battery while doing this. Isopropyl evaporates quickly, and is used for liquid damage remediation for this reason. I have used it to thoroughly clean my 2009 MacBook Pro several times, and am typing on it right now. \nBe careful and gentle with the electronics, and clean it well. Good luck!\n\nA: I do not recommend you open it to clean with liquids: too much can happen.\nAs for the exterior (including screen and keyboard) feel free to clean that.\nAs for the interior, and to clean the fans, I recommend to expose it vaporizer smell of your choice and let it run for a day in that kind of environment. That will compensate for the nicotine smell after a while.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the particulate matter (tars) from the cigarettes and other combustables have accumulated on the internal components. Given enough time (months or years) with fans running, the smell will dissipate. If the MacBook is still under warrantee, take it to an Apple Genius Bar and ask them what to do. You can also call Apple Care and ask them as well. Opening up and giving the internals a through clean, while technically possible, is a task left up to experts. If you are not an expert, do not try this. Leave it up to professionals.\nA similar question, answered in great detail about Desktop PC CPU boxes, can be found on StackExchange. Some of the images are quite graphic and not for the faint-of-heart.\nAnother suggestion is to put it in an airtight box for a long time with activated charcoal (such as one uses for aquariums.) The charcoal should eventually absorb the odor.\nLastly, if this computer is the property of your employer, request a replacement, then find a smoke-free workplace.\n", "Q: What determines the label displayed in the \"Kind\" column of an OS X finder window and in search box labeled \"Kind\"? What determines the label displayed in the \"Kind\" column of an OS X finder window and in search box labeled \"Kind\"?\nFor example, I use LaTeX, and all files with the extension .tex are labeled \"LaTeX\" in the finder Window and I have them set to open with SublimeText.\nDid SublimeText set the file \"Kind\"?\nAlso, if I want to search for all file of type \"LaTeX\" the Finder search box only gives me a limited set of options for \"Kind\", e.g. Application, Archive, Document, etc. Can I change that option box to show \"LaTeX\".\n\nA: CFBundleDocumentTypes\nTo answer your first and second question:\nOS X applications are able to register document types with the system. They do so by declaring those document types within the CFBundleDocumentTypes section in the Info.plist file which resides inside the application bundle.\nFor example, you can find the entry for the LaTeX kind by opening Terminal.app and invoking this command:\n$ grep LaTeX -B4 -A7 /Applications/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nThe resulting XML chunk defines the three-way relationship between the application, the name of the bundle type (aka Kind), and the respective file extensions:\n<dict>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n    <string>Editor</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n    <string>LaTeX</string>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>tex</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n    <string>TeX</string>\n</dict>\n\nFor more details about document types, see the section CFBundleDocumentTypes in the document Registering the File Types Your App Supports from Apple’s Developer Library.\nSpotlight searches\nTo answer your third question:\n\nCan I change that option box to show \"LaTeX\"\n\nOpen the drop down box and choose Other. A text box appears; type the name of the file kind you wish to search for, or any substring of it.\nIf the Other option won’t appear in the drop-down list, you might need to enable the option first by going to System Preferences » Spotlight and ticking the checkbox next to Other.\n", "Q: Is there a way for iTunes video player to play/pause when it is in/out of focus?

I think I'd like something if only to provide a layer of ventilation and buffer between myself and the computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone have any experience actually getting a cooling pad for their mac?\n\n*Is it really not worth it to spend twenty bucks to provide better ventilation?\n\n*If you think it's worth it, any specific recommendations on products?\n\nA: Make One\nSee my answer on a similar Question.\nBoost your laptop with a Roost, and add a 4\" fan from BestBuy.\n\n\n\nA: Laptops are designed to be able to handle high internal temperatures and the fact that the body heats up and the fans come on when performing processor-intensive tasks is not a problem (in fact, it's by design). That said, due to limited space the internal fans are tiny and high RPM, making them quite noisy and possibly quite annoying (depending of course on your tolerance for fan noise!). \nA cooling pad can be useful for a few reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*They have larger, lower RPM fans - lower noise than the internal laptop fans\n\n*Some have adjustable fan speeds - again, lower noise\n\n*They may have other features, like the ability to elevate your laptop\n\n\nThe key feature for me is the low RPM fans - they can be near silent and prevent the laptop's internal fans from going on. As you say, for $20 you've got nothing to lose! I have a cheap Avantek cooler and it works nicely - most of the time it stops my MacBook's fans from going on and it's near silent.\n", "Q: How to record on CD my Album from Photos App?

You can install bash 4+ however and also can make it your default shell (including for Terminal and iTerm2) by doing the following.\nInstall Bash 4 via Homebrew\nFirst install the newer version of bash. There are various ways of doing that, I prefer Homebrew.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew as described at http://brew.sh.  \n\n*Install bash using brew install bash.\n\n\nBash 4 is now available on your PATH (assuming Homebrew bin is on your path). However, it is not yet your default shell. You can find where it is located by running which bash. In my case it is at /usr/local/bin/bash. \nUsing Bash 4\nSince it is on your PATH, you can start a Bash 4 session with just bash or it can be used in scripts by using a Shebang.\nFor example, this will use a specific bash instance.\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n...your script...\n\nThis will use the first bash on the PATH.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n...your script...\n\nYou can also set the bash path for specific profiles in Terminal/iTerm2 using the steps described in @user136952's answer.\nMaking Bash 4 the default\nAs mentioned above, after installing Bash 4 is still not the default shell. To make bash the default you need to do two more steps.\nFirst, add the Bash 4 path to your /etc/shells file so that it is an allowed login shell. As described in /etc/shells, this file has the list of valid login shells. After adding the new bash path my /etc/shells looks like the following:\n# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).\n# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using\n# one of these shells.\n\n/bin/bash\n/bin/csh\n/bin/ksh\n/bin/sh\n/bin/tcsh\n/bin/zsh\n/usr/local/bin/bash\n\nNext we use chsh to make it your default shell. So any sessions for that user will use that shell. You can read more about this in Change the Shell in Mac OS X Terminal, but the actual command is very straightforward.\nchsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash\n\nNow the new bash is our default login shell. If you open Terminal or iTerm2 and run bash --version you should see the new version. Note the \"License GPLv3+\" which is why Apple doesn't bundle it with macOS.\n$ bash --version\nGNU bash, version 4.4.12(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin16.6.0)\nCopyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\n\n\nA: The side-by-side install with an update to your shell (via chsh or the GUI) will fail for scripts. Scripts often use env bash, which reverts to the OS X bash version. So, what you want may not be the complete update of bash, but a side-by-side install that always returns the newer version of bash (i.e. even when env is invoked).\nSo, to handle this:\n1) install bash via Homebrew, as the other commenters have posted\n2) set your login shell to this new version (via the GUI or chsh command as others have posted)\n3) set /usr/local/bin (or the path to the new bash version) ahead of /bin on your $PATH variable, by adding this to your ~/.bash_profile: export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nA: 2019: As simple as in this post\n$ brew install bash\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/bash >> /etc/shells'\n$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash\n\nthen tab a new terminal, enjoy!\n\nA: For M1 Macs -\nYou can update bash by doing\nbrew install bash\nassuming that you already have Home-brew. This will install the latest version of bash. You can check you installation by running -\nbrew info bash\nTo update the shell, simply restart the terminal and check the version of bash using -\nbash --version\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Will Apple Music work with iPod Classic and iPod Nano? Will I be able to sync offline Apple Music to non-internet Apple devices e.g. iPod Nano and iPod Classic?\n\nA: Apple Music is not available on iPod nano and iPod shuffle.\nSee footnote 3: http://www.apple.com/uk/music/\n\nA: Offline tracks obtained through apple music do not sync across to ipod.\nIts a shame really, they could easily put a timer on the songs, so if the ipod is not plugged into registered device every so often, the songs will become locked.\n\nA: I recently bought an iPod Nano, and I am very happy with it! The only downside is that Apple Music is not available for it. Which frankly is a new low for Apple, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna fix it up later. Although it might be a huge way for people to abuse the system. They could download a gazillion tracks into the iPod and never connect it to a computer again. For now Apple Music is not available in devices such as iPod Nano, iPod Classic or iPod Shuffle. Apple will find a way to find a way, but for now all we can do is... wait.\n\nA: No. Unlike iPhone,iPad or iPod touch 5/6, iPod nano and iPod shuffle don't have Wi-Fi compatibility which means they won't be able to support Apple Music.

Have a 2007 21\" imac. friend installed 2, 4GB memory for me, Apple genius says that's what causing slow downs on my machine? when they tested it only had a 4GB & a 2GB cards, so someone along the way did a switch on me. Apple says my machine can only handle 4GB total. i wonder if that's true? seems like it ran quite well for a long time, & it used to corroborate that it had 8 GB memory, so something fishy has occurred. machine is running quirky & would like to have max memory. Would appreciate some knowledgeable input... \n\nA: Crucial, UK state that 4GB is the maximum amount of RAM that your iMac officially supports. \nIf you put more in and it worked then this could be seen as a 'bug', and wouldn't be supported by Apple. Such abilities could also be revoked through software/firm was updates. \n\nA: according to Mactracker the mid 2007 imac 20inch has:\nMaximum Memory  6.0 GB (Actual) 4.0 GB (Apple)\nMemory Slots    2 - 200-pin PC2-5300 (667MHz) DDR2 SO-DIMM\nyou should also make sure that you always have the same amount on both slots in your case two 3gb however 3gb rams are rare therefore more expensive\n\nA: In another forum some users have confirmed 2007 iMac works with 8 GB with no issue after the el Captain upgrade.  \n", "Q: kernel_task filling up disk Something weird just happened.\nI got a warning that my disk was running out of space. I knew that it had like 15GB free before and wondered where all the free space went.\nI checked Activity Monitor which showed me that kernel_task wrote around 16GB of memory to disk. I kept observing and noticed that it went up at a rate of around 1GB per minute.\nThis went on until there were 0 Bytes left on my disk. This made my macbook basically unusable. I couldn't even open Web pages and when i tried to shut it down, it froze.\nI did a forced reboot and the lost memory is back now. kernel_task is not writing to disk like crazy as before either. Anyway, I'd like to know what happened there. Any clues about what could've caused this?\n\nA: This happened to me once. I used Daisy Disk to figure out where the disk usage was coming from.\nIn my case, there was a problem with the coresymbolicationd cache, which was growing indefinitely, and continuing through reboots and reinstalls of the latest Combo Update.\nAfter deleting /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd, everything returned to normal.\nNext time this happens, I recommend taking a look with that utility.\n\nA: Restart the computer.\nHold Command+Option+P+R on startup and verify Macintosh HD\nDo a PRAM reset,\n\nTo reset your NVRAM, you use exactly the same procedure you once used to reset PRAM: Shut down your Mac, press the power button, and as soon as you hear the startup chime, hold down Command-Option-P-R. Keep holding down those keys until you hear a second startup chime. Then let go and allow your Mac to continue starting normally. Then check the Startup Disk, Display, and Date & Time panes of System Preferences to make sure they’re set the way you want them.\nIf you hold down Command-Option-P-R at startup and you see nothing but a gray screen that doesn’t change for several minutes—no Apple logo, no progress bar, no second startup chime—don’t panic. (This happened to me just last week.) The most likely cause is that your Mac isn’t registering the key presses due to wonkiness with a USB device. Disconnect all USB devices (except your keyboard, if it’s a wired keyboard), hold the power button down until the Mac shuts off completely, and then press it again and immediately hold down Command-Option-P-R. If that doesn’t work and you’re using an external Bluetooth keyboard, try plugging in a USB keyboard instead. If you’re able to reset the NVRAM successfully with the wired keyboard, you can disconnect it and go back to your normal Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nReset the SMC, if all else fails\n\nBefore you can reset your SMC, you must shut down your Mac. After that, the procedure varies depending on the type of Mac you have.\nDesktop Macs: Disconnect the power cord (either from the Mac or from the AC outlet). Wait 15 seconds and plug it back in. Then wait another 5 seconds and turn the Mac back on.\nPortable Macs with non-removable batteries: Make sure the Mac is plugged in to AC power. On the built-in keyboard, press and hold the Shift, Option, and Control keys on the left side and press the power button. Release all the keys at once, and then turn the Mac on normally.\nPortable Macs with removable batteries: Disconnect the AC power cord and remove the battery. Press the power button, hold it for 5 seconds, and then let go. Put the battery back in, reconnect the power cord, and turn the Mac on normally.\n\nThis could be caused by a number of things, but usually it's just a glitch in macOS.\n", "Q: Windows Zoomit like tool from mac I have been using zoomit on windows.

I tried upgrading to Yosemite hoping this might improve performance; no dice. I've decided to try clean-booting Yosemite to see if this improves things.\nI've been following instructions here to do a clean install and here to create a bootable flash drive. Drive creation seems to work fine: it has the correct GUID partition table, terminal command exits with the copy complete; done output, the disk shows up in the Finder as \"Install OSX Yosemite\", etc. When I restart the computer holding Option, the installer shows up as a bootable disk (unlike the question here).\nMy problem is that when I then click on the installer, I get a loading bar for some seconds and then the screen goes to a circle with a slash through it. It's the same behaviour detailed here but note that I have verified that my disk has the correct GUID partition table. I also tried resetting PRAM, to no effect.\nAny suggestions welcome.\n\nA: The boot problem seemed to have been related to a disk error on the hard disk of the mac. I ran the disk utility and it detected a problem with the macbook's HDD (something with doubled file links), which it then repaired. The computer was still slow and unresponsive after the disk repair. After that the boot from the USB worked fine, and I was able to clean install OSX Yosemite.\nI recovered the computer from my time machine backup, excluding applications, and now the computer is noticeably faster and more responsive. I don't know whether a specific application or accumulated OSX sludge was responsible for the slowdown, but I'm happy I went through the pain of the clean install.\n\nA: I've recently replaced my Macbook's hard drive with a new SSD to speed up its performance. For my purpose, I had to do a fresh install of OSX Yosemite on the new SSD, and I also encountered the \"no\" symbol or \"prohibited\" symbol when I tried to load the OSX installer through my bootable USB.\nI tried rebooting the computer and re-downloading the OSX installer files on my USB a couple of times but it made no difference. The USB seemed perfectly fine when I ran the Disk Utility first aid and the Terminal didn't output error codes either.\nLater, I found out the problem actually came from creating the bootable USB through Terminal. Somehow the installer files got corrupted when making the USB bootable. The solution is to use a third-party application like Install Disk Creator to do job instead of using Terminal. It worked for me and I was able to install OSX Yosemite afterwards.\n", "Q: Remove .plist from /LaunchAgents Before I go to the issue, I did find a similar thread, but it's quite outdated and I'm not sure if it suits for me.\nAround two years ago when I got my Mac, I decided to install Seagate Media Sync for my GoFlex device. Now, 3 years after purchase of the drive, I'd like to get rid of it and uninstall Media Sync from my computer. I got rid of the app but theres a 2nd app inside it's application support folder which keeps launch itself even if I quit the process.\nI saw that one can run a specific terminal command to remove it, but I just wanted to make sure I have the correct instructions. The file is located inside the /Libary/LaunchAgents folder and named \"com.seagate.mediasync.plist\", some say it's just sufficient to remove the .plist file from there, but won't OS X constantly give a error because it has instructions to launch it? If it's better to just do it through terminal, I'd rather do that but I'm not certain which command that fits.. According to this article(also a bit outdated), you'll just need to run launchctl remove com.anoying.service, but it doesn't say anything about .plist files and more like folders..\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Run the command you mentioned, then delete the plist.

This happens whether I physically click the trackpad or if I just do a tap to click. I have tried changing the double click speed to no avail. It might be a hardware issue, but the fact that it happens when I tap to click leads me to believe it is at least not a mechanical issue (still possible an electronics/cable issue with the trackpad).

Here's what I tried and what happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing com.apple.finder.plist or com.apple.dock.plist from /Users/username/Library/Preferences then rebooting (as suggested various places such as here) didn't fix the problem. \n\n*Trashing the contents of Library/Saved Application State/ then rebooting did fix the problem—for exactly one search, subsequent searches had the same problem as before.

Let me give you a bit of background.\nI have a Mid 2010 MacBook Pro 13\" that I am using for development. I've bumped up the RAM and installed a 1TB HDD onto which I have installed OS X 10.6 - 10.11, each in its own partition. The reason for this is that I want to be able to test my code under each version of the OS to make sure it performs as expected. I'm not using virtualisation to test as the code needs to access the AirPort card.\nThe \"problem\" that I'm having is that when I use Spotlight, it brings up results from every partition, so if I'm trying to quickly launch a system app, Spotlight shows me 6 versions of the same app.\nWhat I would like to do, if possible, is disable the index for any volume except the current boot volume (so if booted in to Mavericks, Spotlight ignores the volume index for the 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.10 and 10.11 volumes) without destroying the non-boot volume indexes so they don't have to be rebuilt each time I boot to that volume.\n\nA: I currently don't have a multi-boot system to try this on, but I would expect\nSystem prefs > Spotlight > Privacy\non each OS to respect the setting if you dropped each of the other 5 partitions in there; effectively repeating the process for each of the 6 boot partitions as you boot from it.\n\n", "Q: Clone OS X installation from Virtual Machine to Mac Mini I did a new OS X installation via Parallels as a Virtual Machine and configured it as Node for our Jenkins Build Server. I did this because I wanted to do an isolated installation to test adding all the needed packages and then either reinstall our Mac Mini (the \"real\" Jenkins Node) or clone the system and put it on the Mac Mini.\nAnd that's the point: Does anyone have experience cloning an OS X from one Mac to another?\n\nA: Each OS X installation is specific to the hardware model and characteristics of the Mac. The installer creates a set of drivers and configuration files for the specific hardware. So you cannot really clone from VM unless it is exactly the same as your Mac Mini.\nTry migration. I am not sure if you can migrate from a VM but you can always try. Make sure that VM is visible on the network (give it its own IP address).\n\nA: You're better off just getting the data moved, instead of really moving the installation itself. \nPersonally I think it's a benefit that you actually get a clean system to start from - but I guess that depends on the person.\nI see this guy did it with Windows, from Parallels to a Boot camp installation: https://forum.parallels.com/threads/moving-parallels-image-to-boot-camp.10145/\n", "Q: OSX: Dupe-checking / Merging / Cleaning iCloud Contacts & importing 350 additional ones I'm in a bit of a pickle, I've been given an errand (or.. so I thought ;) ) to run, of cleaning up 1100 iCloud Contacts for a friend, who runs a little business. He also handed me 350 additional contacts in Excel Sheets to be added to his iCloud Contacts. (3 Excel files, 3 groups in iCloud Contacts, so he can switch between them). \nNow, I can probably \"kind of\" pull off the Excel->CSV->Import to iCloud Contacts business, but there is a lot of data that needs to be merged into a Notes-entry inside the Contacts  and to be made sure it's not lost. But I would appreciate any and all advice you could give on how to export a reasonable CSV that Contacts (I'm running OSX Mavericks, btw) where multicolumn content that goes into Notes  will actually go into the Notes in Contacts.\nBut here's the real thing. Since he has a completely utterly borked up 1100+ contacts list with multiple duplicates, some entries with no names but just phone numbers, maybe duplicate names with differing e-mail addresses etc, which app or method would you recommend for cleaning it up?\nI tried to google around for apps but all I could find was a fake website that (supposedly) listed 5 excellent Contacts -cleaning applications.. \nBut when I started downloading the #1, I realised I was downloading it from the same server the website was running on - so it was I believe Cisdem that wrote the blog-entry masquerading as a reasonable review of all possible Contacts-managing applications. Now I'm not so convinced that I should try Cisdem at all, if they do shady things like that, I've never had good experiences with these types of fake-review-posting app developers' sites.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: A pickle indeed, data sanitizing is no fun and you have a doozy.\nIf you have access to his iCloud account you can go into contacts, select all of them and click on the gear icon to export them. I do believe that Apple only lets you export as a vCard.\nI do believe there are a number of utilities that convert vcards to another format, some of them online.\nOnce converted I would be tempted to suck them all into an Excel (or other like Numbers, etc.) spreadsheet and do you data massaging there. But that would depend on your Spreadsheet-Fu. But getting it into a CSV format would be the first start. After that it's a matter of mapping all the right fields in an organized way so you can sort and find dupes.\nThen it is a matter of getting the Excel data back into a CSV and then back to vcard format. Pssibly one of the online vcard to CSV sites do the reverse as well.\nHope that at least points you to a line of inquiry that works.\n", "Q: How to hide a photo in the new Photos.app I would like to know if it's possible to hide photos in the new Photos.app \n\nA: Select any [or more than one] photo.\nRight click > Hide [number of selected] Photo\n\n", "Q: Not getting to boot! Last week I upgraded my MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2012 RAM to 8 GB and I had random restarts.

Then selected my main hard disk to startup and then immediately after selection, I held the shift key so it would safe boot.\nIt booted just a bit more than half and hung and switched off.\nI tried to go into recovery mode, but it booted to el Capitan recovery mode and the disk utility was not working.\nIf I try boot normally. It restarts 5 minutes after boot.  \nWhat should I do?\nIs there any way I could change the startup disk without booting so I can  boot into main hard disk recovery mode disk utility and maybe repair the disk or can someone help me troubleshoot?\n\nA: You should see if Apple Diagnostics finds anything wrong with your RAM. Turn off your computer, disconnect any external peripherals you have, press the power button to turn your computer on, and immediately hold down D until Apple Diagnostics begins.\n\nA: I would connect that Mac to another running back and copy any files that are not backed up. Then I would then erase the hard drive/ partition and reinstall whatever operating system I wanted to run on it.\n", "Q: Hard Drive Change SSD - Macbook Pro My Macbook was slow, and then I've wanted to make it faster, it is a Macbook Pro from 2011 or 2012, I can't remember. I bought a Samsung SSD 850 EVO.\nFirstly what I did, was to take out the old hard-drive, and then I placed the new SSD in it, I made a bootable thumb-drive, with Yosemite 10.10, and then I tried to boot it from the USB, but I could't install it, because the hard drive didn't show up, because it wasn't formatted. I did that, by taking the old hard drive, inside the Macbook, and used a hard drive dockingstation, to format it, via. disk utility. The hard drive, can only be installed from, the dockingstation, without any issues. I did that, and boot up the Macbook, a Apple logo with a spinning wheel under it, and nothing happens. I tryed everything, used Carbon Copy Cloner, I tried to make a bootable thumb drive, with diskmakerx.\nIn recovery, when the SSD is in the dockingstation, I was able to install Mountain Lion, from there, I could boot up fine, no issues. After I placed the SSD with a succesfull Mountain Lion, inside the computer, I wasn't able to boot up again, only a Apple logo and a spinning wheel, under it.\nI used 4 weeks to make the computer work, I searched all arround Google, Apple.com, and other sites. But I couldn't find any solution.\nAny help?\n\nA: I upgraded several Macbooks with Samsung SSDs. But they were EVO 840. Here is what I noted for myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*SDD had to be plugged instead of the original HDD. Plugging in instead of DVD gives issues.\n\n*The connector is very hard to plug and unplug to Samsung SSDs. It is much easier with Apple HDD. So you have to press firm to plug in the SSD. To unplug, gently use a small flat screwdriver to separate the SSD from the connector. This \"hard\" connector could be reason why you do not see the SSD.\n\n\nI doubt that installing SSD in the dock station will work if you try to put it in without that dock station. OS X knows where you plug what. You need a proper device path, which means it has to be connected properly during the installation.\n", "Q: Recover pictures deleted by syncing iPhone from different photo library Today while I was trying to transfer pictures from computer to my iPhone, I selected the folder I wanted to copy then a message appeared on the screen that  \n\nPhotos synced to iPhone from other photo libraries or folders will be removed and photos will be synced from this computer. Photos taken from iPhone will not affected.\n\nI entered the option Remove and Sync. \nNow the older pictures have been deleted and the new one's have been added.\nHow can I recover the older picture?\n\nA: iDevices can only by synced to one computer running iTunes.\nSyncing to a new computer/iTunes will erase all previous data.\nIf you still have the other computer that the iPhone was last synced to, then you might be able to retrieve them from your last backup. Alternatively, check your iCloud storage.\nIt would have been far safer to click Cancel & instead copy the previous photos to the computer using Photos.app or Image Capture, Mac or Photo Gallery [part of MS Essentials], PC.\n", "Q: How to sync ForkLift Favourites and settings across computers? is there any 'easy' way to sync my ForkLift so I don't have to keep updating my three computers every time I add an FTP for example..\nI thought about doing a symlink via dropbox but I don't have idea of which folders contain this information.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks,\nLuis.\n\nA: At the risk of resurrecting this old thread, I've just had the exact same problem.\nAccording to the developers the next major version will allow syncing of password-protected favorites via Dropbox. As of this writing no release date has been set.\nIn the meantime you could try this.\nForkLift preferences – including Favorites – are stored in\n/Users/your-user-name/Library/Preferences/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist\n\nMove – not copy – this file to your Dropbox. I placed mine in a folder named ForkLift.\nNext, you need to create a symlink using the ln command in Terminal with the -s switch. This is important as simply dragging the file in the Finder to create an alias will not work.\nln -s /Users/your-user-name/Dropbox/ForkLift/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist /Users/your-user-name/Library/Preferences/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist\n\nThe downside is that passwords are not copied. Also, having ForkLift open at the same time on different machines will likely cause a file conflict with the preference file. But this solution works for me.\n\nA: In ForkLift 3 file locations has changed.\nPreference stay stored in /Library/Preferences/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist, while favourites are now stored in ~/Library/Application Support/ForkLift/Favorites/Favorites.json.\nCan be used for restoring backups or with steps described by tech-otaku for sync.\n\nA: Thank you for the information. One warning: if you use an alias instead of a symlink then ForkLift 3.4.4 will crash at startup.\nAs others have noted ForkLift 3 has a preference to sync your Favorites using DropBox, but I prefer to make the symlink myself, because it is compatible with any cloud service and allows me to put the folder where I want.\n", "Q: Can I change which day I get the Activity.app weekly summary?

I wrote an import random code, and unfortunately saved it as the module's name I was trying to call. eg. random.py\nI believe, but am not sure, that I created the random.py file twice and thus I deleted the random.pyc, twice, that popped up in the file holding all my python programs, after running import random in the terminal, twice. \nIf I didn't create the random.py twice, somehow another random.pyc (besides the first one) was in the file holding my programs and I deleted it. \nAll the people I asked told me to delete the .pyc, and any file with random, random.pyo as its name. I've checked all my user created files, and none of them fit the description.\nOne of them told me to find and clear the temporary cached version of the random.pyc and random.pyo. \nMy question is where on this MAC air Yosemite can I locate a temporary cached version, and how to safely clear it?\n\nA: use mdfind to locate all the files with that name (you might need to grep -w for the string or use mdfind with a \"kMDItemFSName == whatever.py\" clause)\nOnce you know where you've sprayed those files, you could either edit it into the question or decide to do a clean install / migrate user data or remove all the python and then patch that together from a clean install on an external drive.\nIt's had to know what specific things you've done, but hopefully a few of the tools can narrow you down to some options.\nIf I were on deadline and just needed to know what version of python was running - I'd brew install python after setting up https://brew.sh\nYou'd then have three installations, but the one that runs from the shell is controllable with $PATH and you can be sure it's up to date with homebrew.\n\nA: Final Answer:\nHey new programmers to python.\nI had a problem of importing the built-in module 'random'.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you do not name your program after the module.\na. If you do, you have to delete the newly created random.pyc or other\nrandom. file name duplicates in the file which holds the random.py you \ncreated. These are GUI files that can be placed in trashcan. This step \nshould solve 100% of your file duplicate problems if you have python\n2.x\nLearn to recognize the original files. From a mistake of my own I \n found the path to the module in the Python standard library. MAC Path \n just before module is named:  \n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7\n\nUse 'cd ..', 'ls', and 'cd' to get to python2.7 and enter 'ls' and you \nwill see a lot of original files with .py, .pyo, .pyc endings. This is  \nthe location that they only should be in other than a similar path but \nin a different python version.)\n\n i. If you still think you have newly created files floating about in \n the library use command;\n\n      find ./python2.7 -name random.* -ls\n\n This will list the date of all files that start with 'random.' and   \n if there any have dates that do not match with the original \n installation date or update dates, that is the file that is \n causing the problem. \n\n ii. You can also type this command into terminal to find   \n files but it doesn't list the time of installation;\n\n  mdfind kMDItemFSName == random.py\n\n Obviously, since you know what the original file path looks like, \n you'll be able to not target the wrong file!\n\n\n\n*Once you eliminated new files, rename your program anything other than random.py and possibly anything other than reserved words in python. I called mine generator.py\n\n*Make sure when in terminal you are in the right path before you start 'python', and type 'import generator' (or what the program is called). \nTo get to the right path use 'ls', 'cd' commands to get to the path that ends with the file that holds the program. (This was the last block to getting the import to work - I spent at least 6 hrs agonizing I had other hidden newly created .pyc files even when the command searches I had done above yielded none. \nYou find yourself blocked, take a break, and come back to it. Something clicked in my head after looking at several places online including stackflow, python.org (https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html), and all this talk about paths.\nI was never in the right path before I imported!!\n\n\n*Start 'python'\n\n*Enter 'import generator'\nYou should get an output of 10 numbers from 0.0 to 1.0\nI answered how to find new versions of random.py, random.pyc, and random.pyc. I partially answered how to clear the new ones, especially the ones you can manually dump in your trashcan. I still do not know how to find temporary cached version of the files because apparently that wasn't the problem! The problem was I named my program a bad name, and I was not in the right path before I started python and importing.\n\nA: For python 2.x all files related to the random.py file you created will be in the same directory as this file.\nFor python 3.4 see this section about compiled python files of the python docs\n\nTo speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the __pycache__ directory under the name module.version.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would be cached as __pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.\n\n", "Q: Apple Watch Remote Old iPhone My setup is as follows:\nI have the Apple Watch on my wrist, and I have an old iPhone 4s with iOS 8.4 sitting on a docking station\nCan I control the music playing through the iPhone through the Watch? - I can control the music playing on my mac & newer iPhone 6 but can't figure out, if possible, how to do it on the old one?\n\nA: You can't control music on the iPhone 4s because Apple made it so the iPhone 4s doesn't support the Apple Watch.\n", "Q: Image Viewer like Windows Image Viewer I want a good image viewer for mac.

Is there a way to disentangle that (make /usr/local/include an independent directory containing those files that belong there (which ones are that?) and keep the rest in /usr/include/)?\n\nA: As you say it is a mess and there is no easy way to undo this as it is difficult to tell which ones were installed from which source.\nThe ones which should be in /usr/include come from OS X directly or Xcode and its command line tools.\nSo in theory you can identify which are Homebrew and which are not. \nIf you could then remove the /usr/local/include link mkdir a new /usr/local/include then mv the Homebrew items from /usr/include to the new dir. Then reinstall OS X and Xcode command line tools (the latter might be sufficient).  However I think this is not going to be doable in practice. So delete the link and directory and reinstall OS X, Xcode command line tools and Homebrew.\nIf all your builds have /usr/local/include as the first include directory then you won't have any issues but that is ALL builds.

I'm trying to find the actual GPU processor load on my iMac with the M290x. The load average being reported never goes above 5, even when running Cinebench 3d benchmarks. Certainly that doesn't mean only 5% GPU utilization does it?\nHow do I interpret the Load Average (i assume that it's the reading for the GPU)? I've attached a screen shot.\nRunning latest Yosemite.\n\n\nA: Load average is CPU based, not GPU based. The numbers represent one, five, and fifteen minute averages of the load on the CPU.\n\nA single-core CPU is like a single lane of traffic. Imagine you are a bridge operator ... sometimes your bridge is so busy there are cars lined up to cross. You want to let folks know how traffic is moving on your bridge. A decent metric would be how many cars are waiting at a particular time. If no cars are waiting, incoming drivers know they can drive across right away. If cars are backed up, drivers know they're in for delays.\n\nSource: http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2009/07/31/understanding-load-averages\n1 core with a load of 1 means that core is 100% busy. But you can add loads when heaving more cores. 4 cpu's with a load of 1 means the total of the 4 cores is 25% busy, a load of 4 means 100%. A load higher than the number of cores means that the cores can not handle the load an the cpu is running 100% per core (and is the bottleneck of your system)\n\nA: Open up the terminal and type \nman getloadaverage\n\nTo quote the man page:\n\nThe getloadavg() function returns the number of processes in the system run queue averaged over various periods of time.  Up to nelem samples are retrieved\n       and assigned to successive elements of loadavg[].  The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes,\n       respectively.\n\nNote that, typically, for UNIX/Linux systems, a system with with no load should have these three numbers close to zero (lower bound). For Mac OS X Mavericks and later versions, this lower bound seems to be closer to 1, probably due to the way the system scheduler works.\n\nA: \"Hardware acceleration\" could also contribute to load average (without bottlenecking).\n", "Q: Two phone numbers on FaceTime We have 2 iPads, 2 iPhones and 1 Apple ID.

I considered that, depending on which display was active, that toggling the dock would cause it to appear on whichever display was active at the time. However, I find that dock remains on the given display.\nHowever, I believe the solution is simply to explain how the mouse or trackpad is used to move the dock.\nThe rule is that by moving the cursor 1\" below the bottom of the given display, the dock will then move.\n", "Q: What programs actually use the memory on a Graphics card?

Will creating a standard new account satisfy, or something more is required?\n\nA: The only way to avoid a user being able to access your data is to remove your data from the machine. This is due to the fact that a user could enable the root user via Single User mode on boot and can then have unfettered access to the system. You can put up blocks to hinder this as well, but that depends on your desire to keep all information secure.\nA standard user account is the easiest option and is somewhat effective. However, your friend will not be able to do certain things on the machine since they won't have admin rights. The level of access necessary would hinge on how much the friend would need to do while they have the machine.\n\nA: You can come pretty close, but not absolutely lock the computer down. There are three critical steps to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put all of the files you want to keep private in private directories, e.g. in your Documents folder. The top level of your home folder is readable by all users, and the default permissions for newly created files and folders is similarly readable. Note that this includes things like unix-style configuration files (including invisible \"dotfiles\") created at the top level of your home folder.\nIf you want to, you can remove permissions for other users to read your home folder at all with the command chmod go= ~ -- but note that this will lock other users out of your Public folder as well.\nAlso, make sure you don't have any private files stored outside your home folder.\n\n*Give your friend a \"Standard\" (or Managed with Parental Controls) account, and make sure they don't know the password(s) to your Administrator account(s).\n\n*Set a firmware password on the computer. This will prevent your friend from invoking single-user mode (which @smoooosher mentioned), recovery mode, and a number of other startup-time modes that'd let your friend take full control of the computer.\nDon't tell your friend the firmware password.\nDo make sure you remember (i.e. record) the firmware password, so you can remove it later. Resetting a lost firmware password is a major operation on modern Macs, and you don't want to have to go through it.\nWith these steps, your MacBook Pro will be pretty well locked down, but not absolutely so. There are a couple of possible ways your friend could still bypass security:\n\n\n*\n\n*They could open the MBP up, remove the drive, and read it directly on another computer. Note that enabling FileVault encryption won't really help with this, since any account password (including your friend's) could be used to unlock and read the disk.\n\n*They could hope for a privilege escalation vulnerability to be discovered in OS X that'd let them get admin or root access from their standard account. You can mitigate this a bit by enabling as much update automation as possible (in System Preferences -> App Store pane).\np.s. You might also want to enable Find My Mac linked to your iCloud account -- this'll let you track and (if necessary) remote-wipe your Mac. Be sure you have a good backup before enabling this, though. Actually, be sure you have a good backup anyway.\np.p.s.

Somehow, it became slightly purple in one area. I'm not sure how things have added up, but I'll state the facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*My watch arrived only less than a month ago on June 1, 2015.\n\n*Usually, I wash with water, toilet paper, and a microfiber cloth, and everything comes out just fine.\n\n*I wanted to wash it today. Here's what I used and what happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, rubbing alcohol with a blue microfiber cloth => the back of the longer piece of the band started barely turning purple.\n\n*Next, water using my thumb under the faucet => the purplish hue came off, but the toilet paper I placed it on began to look very purple.\n\n*Next, toilet paper => that paper became purple as well while I rubbed the back of the band.\n\n*I flipped over the band, and the front had a purple stain.\n\n*I used water => it didn't go away.\n\n*I rubbed with toilet paper => a gray line appeared across the purple stain.\n\n*I used water and toilet paper and rubbed quite a bit => the streak left, but the stain remained.\n\n*I finally tried the blue cloth, my thumb, and even the alcohol => the stain remained.\n\n\n\nI'm frankly concerned that this thing will never come off. I did research on Apple's policy on returning bands, etc., and though I need to confirm, it sounds like any discolored or warped bands will not be accepted for replacements.\nNote that the texture of the stained part of the band now feels different from that of the rest of the band, almost like it's more rough. Also, the other half of the band, which was very dirty, washed off just fine with only water and a microfiber cloth.\nHere are some pictures of the stain (see descriptions for more details):\n\nThe stained half of the band, with the purple stain circled in red.\n\nThe original photo of the stain edited for contrast. The purple stain is clearly visible here. (Note: The only editing done here was lighting and contrast changes that can be done in the Photos app on the iPhone. I did not Photoshop this or alter the stain itself, etc.)\n\nUpdate: I just realized something that may help get the stain off. I never got the chance to follow bmike's advice; I will likely ultimately follow it, but for the time being, I was hoping that this might help find something that I can do myself to clean it.\nCheck out this photo:\n\nI do a lot of handwriting. Yes, that is my pinky, covered in pen ink, which turns purple when there isn't a thick layer but a thin one over it. Coincidentally, my watch band was stained purple. It adds up to suggest that it's a pen ink stain, which I doubt is more temporary than permanent.\nThus, I suppose my question has changed:\nIs it possible to remove pen ink stains (just a typical black ballpoint pen) from a white Apple Watch sport band without damaging it? If so, how? Or is it wiser to just take it in to Apple and see what they can do to help?\n\nA: Apple's warranty policy allows them to not cover cosmetic damage to parts however, they may not choose to deny a warranty swap if you present the band for service and are reasonable. (I don't think you'll be angry, just that I've seen people totally ruin things by rude or boorish behavior when they are angry and seek service with aggressive language or worse).\nI would print out or be very familiar with Apple's cleaning guide for the product. They may decide to take back some parts for quality control that wouldn't normally be exchanged since the product is so new.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204522\nDo be aware that toilet paper is not lint free cloth and many brands may not even be non-abrasive. The only cleaning agent Apple recommends is water so be sure to understand if they charge for a replacement if you don't follow their recommendations. Better to take the dirty band in and ask if it's cleanable than to show up after you expanded the list of techniques.\nEven if you did resort to harsh methods, asking for help is still worth its IMO.\n\nA: I apologize for my somewhat long-winded, poor question.\nAs it turns out, I've found the answer myself: time. I used the cleaning methods outlined by Apple, only using my fingers, a towel, some water, and a microfiber cloth, and over the weeks the stain has faded.\nLesson learned: don't let WATCH Sport bands touch pen ink, whether from your average ball point pen or an actual dish of ink.\nThanks for all your help.\n\nA: Use a Magic Eraser. They get stains off of anything.\n\nA: Mine was completely blue on both sides. Tried everything from spray and wipe to baby wipes. Tonight I decided to try eucalyptus oil and the stains came straight off. It's like a new band!\n\nA: Hydrogen peroxide might be your best bet. It's pretty close to water and it's great for removing stains from silicone. Like bleach, Hydrogen Peroxide is an oxidant which is great for breaking down color stains.\n\nA: The band has obviously come into contact with something it is chemically incompatible with. Based on the size and position maybe you leaned against something, or spilled some gas on it when filling the car?\nChemical damage can't be cleaned. Either live with it, or get a new band.\n", "Q: Devices not showing up for AirDrop I have \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5 (with iOS 8.3)\n\n*MacBook Pro Early 2013 (with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3)\n\n*iPad Air (with iOS 8.3)\n\n\nMy iPhone is paired with the MacBook, so e.g when my phone rings, I can see it in my computer.

When I try to give my Apple ID it ends up telling me I need to give it credit card info. I do not own a credit card, for religious reasons, and I can't figure out how to update to Yosemite without it.\n\nA: maybe the information in this link will help?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204034\n\nA: You have a couple of options that I can see:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can create a second Apple ID for the \"purchase\" (and any other free apps you want). All you need is another email address to link the second account to. Apple generally recommends using a single Apple ID for both iCloud and App Store, but it's not required, and since all you're \"buying\" is a free upgrade, it doesn't matter much which ID you use for the purchase.\nIn order to get the \"none\" option for payment, you need to create the Apple ID while \"buying\" a free app (such as Yosemite). The full process is given in Apple support document HT204034, but here's the short summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store, and make sure you're not already signed into an Apple ID (if the Store menu has a \"Sign Out\" choice, use it).\n\n*Find a free app (e.g. Yosemite), and click Get.\n\n*In the Sign In dialog, click Create Apple ID.\n\n*Follow the prompts to create the Apple ID; as long as you're creating it at this point, you should get the \"none\" option for payment.\n\n*A verification email will be sent to the address you used for this ID. You need to click the \"Verify Now\" link in the email and sign in again before you can use the ID for the App Store.\n\n*After all that, you have to go back to the App Store application, sign in with the new ID, and \"Get\" Yosemite.\n\n\n*The other option, which might or might not be workable for you, is to borrow a friend's credit card for the setup process, then go into iTunes and change the payment type to \"none\" (see Apple support document HT201266).

In the legal agreement says that I should be over 18, and I'm not so, i can't do it. I've contacted the apple developer support and they told me that I should use a account in my father's name. We reside in Brazil. With that, I had some doubts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the name on the App Store be mine or my father's?\n\n*In the future, when I'm 18, this account can be transferred to my name?\n\n\nBesides that, if someone has any advice or (legal) workaround I'd appreciate it, thanks\n\nA: The person that registers is the owner. They can of-course enter a contract to give you control of their goods or form a corporation. You'd need to consult a lawyer if you want help forming a corporation and they'd need to know Brazil law as well as US law.\nI wouldn't let any of this hinder you. You'll do the work, you'll start with as much responsibility as your father allows and when you're 18 you can transfer the account to your Apple ID or keep using the one you share. You can transfer accounts today - so unless that changes between now and when you're 18 that should be a non-issue.\nMost developers that have commercially viable apps are a team, so if you can start with that - no worries. I believe you can even associate any Apple ID with the developer program once Apple is convinced that the primary legal account can accept the terms and conditions under a legally binding framework. Basically US law and presumably Brazilian law prohibit minors from entering into many binding agreements.\nSo, your father's Apple ID would accept the legal responsibility to be bound by the terms and then allow your account as little or as much authority as the iTunes connect allows (quite a good deal of freedom can be delegated thusly).\n", "Q: Wi-Fi Network only appears after I connect to another Wi-Fi network This is a very intriguing problem.

Other guides to difficult for me I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13\" mid 2014 model. I have 256 GB Disk Space and want to install Windows mainly for gaming but other programs as well but I do not have enough space for my needs. My current bootcamp partition is 64GB and i have already filled that up. I would prefer to install windows on a LaCie Porsche Design USB 3.0 or any other cheap and very fast USB 3.0 or thunderbolt drive. (Under £60 ($100)) (Drive space from 500GB-1TB). Anyways I have seen other guides but they confuse me as I am not a tech genius but am capable enough on the laptop. I want to install Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 10 Technical Preview and update to full Windows 10. Is upgrading possible on a External Hard Drive? Anyway I would like to see some help and thank you. \nGuides I've looked at:\nInstall Windows 7 on external drive and boot it from a Mac\nhttp://bleeptobleep.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/mac-install-windows-7-or-8-on-external.html\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5431182\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/2eqap2/has_anyone_installed_windows_boot_camp_onto_an/\n\nA: Using boot camp or virtualization software (e.g., Parallels) works fine with the MacBook Pro systems, though it is important to avoid skimping on the hard drive space, which is the case here. These days, one would want 512 GB as a minimum, though preferably 1 TB.\nInstead of installing Windows on the external hard drive, continue with the existing 64 GB boot camp partition, but then install all of your Windows games to the external hard drive.\nOf note, it would be worthwhile to use a hard drive that has a Thunderbolt connector, since this would allow the highest throughput for data to your 2014 model of MacBook Pro.\nThe nice thing with this arrangement is that when traveling with the system, if you leave the hard drive at home, then you are still able to use the Windows system for other tasks.\nThe other easy way to crack this nut for someone that's \"not a tech genius\" is to just use virtualization software. You trade some money to save yourself some time and have the company that makes the software available to support you in installation and use of that software. Look at VMWare Fusion and Parallels to start down that road. Most have limited trials for free to make sure you're happy with the product before you pay for it.\n\nA: \nMy current bootcamp partition is 64GB and i have already filled that up.\n\nIt seems like your problem is you simply need more storage, not rearranging your windows partition.\n64Gb is lots of space for an operating system and software, even bloated windows doesn't need that much. I would guess you have movies, music and other media - plug in a windows-format external and copy all the media there. Delete from the Mac's internal drive -> lots of free space. \nAlso do the usual windows maintenance processes of delete temp, downloads, installers etc.\n", "Q: Set volume control for each app individually I'm capturing video with Final Cut Pro and I'm hearing the sound of the recording.\nI would like to use the computer for other things while capturing.\nHow can I disable the sound for a specific application?\nPlease don't give solutions for paying apps.\n\nA: I think SoundBunny is an app which works for this. \nLink:\nhttps://www.prosofteng.com/sound-bunny/\nHowever it is paid $10 but there is a free month trial which you might be able to capture your video in time in that month.

Now I connected a brand new (completely tested) SSD (Transcend SSD370S 256GB) to the HDD Strip inside the macbook.\nI've made a bootable USB-Stick with the newest version of Yosemite with Terminal this way:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Name-des-USB-Sticks/ --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/ --nointeraction\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now a started the MacBook, hold down Option Key.\n\n*Booted from USB stick\n\n*Formatted SSD as Mac OS Journaled, 1 Part.

It's so curious I didn't thought this was even possible. When I removed the connector of my optical drive, the macbook starts. When I connect it, it shows me the \"no sign\"\n1Mio. Dollar Question: Why doesn't it boot with SSD but with HDD?\nEdit:\nThe bug wasn't the SSD or the HDD, it was the the HDD flex cable. Firstly I connected my SSD with an OpticalDrive-to-2,5\"-Drive-Adapter and it worked like a charm. So the only possible defect should be the flex cable. Bought one on ebay for 40 bucks and replaced it. Now the macbook works without any problems.\nEdit #2:\nApple already claimed there is/was a fault with the HDD flex cable. But it's not public stated - so you had to ask apple. Found this news article – So I just called Apple, because I already replaced it on my own. Apple said that they can't replace it \"again\" but they can refund my replacement. So 2 weeks later I got a full refund of be ebay invoice.\n", "Q: Command + fullstop VS Ctrl + C Is there any difference between ctrl+c and cmd+. when stopping a terminal process?\n\nA: They are exactly the same. ⌘ CMD+. sends SIGINT just like ⌃ CTRL+c.

If we make a album in iPhone's photo app by selecting some photos from 'all photos', would it multiply or duplicate the pictures in the phone? As the pics will be there in 'all pictures' section too and hence would the extra space be occupied the pix of the freshly created album? \n\nA: No, photos added to albums are references to the original. Deleting the original photo removes the photo from any albums that it has been added to.\n", "Q: Scaling all UI elements when using an external monitor When I use my Macbook Pro's internal monitor, I have the following options in the Display settings menu:\n\nThe best thing here is the Scaled option, which means that I can use the native resolution of the screen and rescale all UI elements bigger or smaller depending on my taste and they still look very sharp.\nHowever, when I connect my Macbook to a 2K monitor, the Scaled option is not available, I can only set the resolution. The Display settings menu looks somewhat like this:\n\nI don't want to change the resolution of my external monitor since I always want to use the native resolution of the monitor to achieve maximum sharpness. However, in my opinion the default UI size of the Mac is a bit too small on a typical 27\" 2K screen so I would like to scale all UI elements bigger (I mean all, not just fonts) as it is possible to do using the internal monitor.\nAccording to some screenshots that I found, the scaled menu is available at least for this 4K monitor:\n\nSo my question is: Why isn't the scaled option always available when using an external monitor with Mac?\nBy the way, the equivalent option in Windows is to change the DPI settings, which causes all elements to look bigger and sharp and it works on all displays:\n\n\nA: You can use the app RDM to scale any monitors but honestly it is not perfect for 1080p monitors because 1280 HiDPI is designed for 2K monitors like the internal one. On my 60\" 1080p monitor it looks a big blurry everywhere, so much worse than the native scale mode while the font does look too small. So I would actually just prefer having bigger fonts on 1080p monitors.\n\nA: In the Display preferences hold down Option and then click on scaled. It will show additional resolutions. \nYou may need to use CMD + F1 to refresh the display. \nAlso, you can turn on mirror display to test resolutions before applying them. \n\nA: The OS X UI is not resolution-independent, the only thing you can do is to change the resolution. Which is essentially what OS X does on HiDPI screens when switching to Larger Text or More Space, but since they are retina displays, you can't see that the resolution in some cases is not native, which you definitively can on non-retina displays. \nThere is a terminal command to change the interface size (which I can't seem to find right now, but I have tried once in 10.6 I believe), but it doesn't work well, especially in 3rd party applications. Some are absolutely unusable.\n\nA: The answers from Amida and Ornataweaver are incorrect and should perhaps be removed to avoid confusion around this issue. \nThe Display settings panels from El Capitan and High Sierra do appear to mean different things, but adjusting the scaling setting in High Sierra does not changing the UI scaling. As in El Capitan, it just changes the resolution of the monitor. Kevin Grabher's earlier reply is correct and remains correct, even under Mojave. \nUI scaling was not available in MacOS El Capitan, and it has not been available in any version of MacOS. \nThose using high resolution monitors who want to make sure they are using all that screen real estate need to make sure the monitor is set to its native resolution in the Displays control panel, and then adjust the size of the Dock and the Finder icons to something usable. There is no way to modify the Menubar text size. \nIf you are using a high resolution screen with a laptop, you will have to readjust the Dock and Finder icons when the monitor is disconnected, then set them again when you are back using the monitor. It's kind of a pain. \nI cannot understand why UI scaling is still not available in MacOS, especially at a time when all sorts of display sizes and resolutions are becoming common, but this is where we stand as of January, 2019. \nI would love to see an app that made this process a little less painful. It'd be nice to have something that detected the monitor being connected or disconnected and made these changes automatically. \n\nA: This depends on the OSX version you are using.\nOn a MacBook Pro late 2013 with El Capitan, I can change the resolution but not the scaling.\n\nOn a MacBook pro mid 2015 with High Sierra, I can change the UI scaling like you wish to do.\n\n\nA: It seems that it depends on the model of the mac, instead of the OS. And the monitor.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587\nIt might be a marketing strategy to allow this feature on certain brands.\nMy MacBook is retina, so it has \"HiDPI mode\" capability. Yet apple doesn't allow me to use this ready feature. They certainly know about it.\n\nA: I had success with RDM as well to sync my 1080p monitor to my 1440p mointor. Though i have a bit pixelation of text on 1080p screen because of less pixel density. Are anyone aware of a way to blur a 1080p screen so the pixelation is more smooth. I would imagine a tiny blur might be able to improve it.\n\nA: There is this hacker tool https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi - it enables the scaled option on display that otherwise doesn't support it. But after using it OS sometimes crashes for me.\n\nA: I have just run into this problem switching from a Dell laptop that blew up to a new 2019 Mac Book Pro.\nOn Windows, I could use my 4k external monitor and scale some elements up and it worked most of the time very nicely.\nI really think it is upsetting not being able to use my monitor at the full resolution without everything being absolutely tiny.\nI have just found a script that supposedly can at least give me more scaled options so I can get an as high resolution as possible...but it still won't be 4k!\n", "Q: DV, QuickTime or iMovie I have some video in .dv format. It comes from old VHS digitalized. The quality is not good, they are spots of 30 seconds and each one has around 300MB. I have a new iMac with the last operating system. I have a lot of them and I have done some test in a couple to see the options.\nIf I click to one of the .dv it opens with QuickTime. If I file > export 720. It is saved to .mov and it have around 10MB or less. (remember from 300MB the original .dv). The quality seems the same.\nIf I import the .dv to iMovie and share > file > 720 and quality medium it is saved to .mp4 and it is around 40MB. \n\n\n*\n\n*The original .dv with 300MB seem too big, specially when they do not have a good quality. Is it good to save it to .mov or .mp4, do I loose anything?\n\n*I do not see any difference of quality between QuickTime.mov 10MB or  iMovie .mp4 40MB Why that difference of MB? is it a good option to save it to QuickTime just because it has less MB?\nThank you\n\nA: The DV format files are in a format designed in 1995, the compression of video has gotten, ahem, a bit better in the ensuing 20 years. That is why the file size looks so big. It is big.\n.dv is a compressed format, but the audio remains uncompressed. What you need to do is go through the manual of the camcorder (usually available online) that shot the video (or something similar) and see what resolution it shot at.\nThen you just convert the .dv file to an mp4 at the same bitrate and resolution and that will give you, probably, the best quality output. MPEG Streamclip and Handbrake should be able to do the conversion (if I recall correctly).\nOr you can blow up the movie in Quicktime and choose the one that looks the best. It all depends on how much time you have to work on this.\n", "Q: Sync / Transfer Spotify Playlist to Apple Music Is it possible to transfer all my Spotify playlist to the new Apple Music? \nI have like 10 playlists with more than 5000 songs, I would hate to lose them. \n\nA: Alright I have found a way online to do it, the article was in Dutch so I will translate it for you all. \nThings you Need:\n\n\n*\n\n*MAC, preferred latest version\n\n*An TextEditor, if you don't have one get the free TextWrangler\n\n*Charles Proxy, free to download proxy tool\n\n*Python 3, download the MAX OS X installer here\n\n*Spotify2Music script\nThe process:\nStep 1 - The Setup\nCreate a folder on your desktop, this will be our working folder.

It's a paid app but will do the job. It works by capturing the Apple Music session data, then adding the songs to iTunes. It will also double check to see if certain songs are already in iTunes. Pretty painless for the most part. So if you're looking for a solution that's a little less involved than the ones above, consider checking this app out.\n", "Q: iCloud Music Library can't be enabled I downloaded iOS 8.4 this morning, and activated Apple Music. I started browsing, and found an album I wanted to add to my library. When I tried to add it, I was told that I needed to enable iCloud Music Library, and was directed to the settings.\n \nHowever, when I try to enable it in the settings, I get an error saying that \"iCloud Music Library can't be enabled\".

After toggling the setting to enable it a dozen times over twenty minutes, it finally worked. This appears to have been a temporary problem associated with the launch.\n\nA: Wait until tomorrow.\nThere are millions of people trying to enable, signing up and \"force retrying\" to activate Apple Music at the same time; from Apple's point of view this probably looks as a DDoS.\n", "Q: Photos Shared Album sort order I want to use a shared album to combine photos taken on different cameras and by different people.  I would like the photos to be sorted by the date/time they were shot.  Instead, Apple is sorting by upload date, which is almost useless.  (That would be a photo-stream and is a very different use case.)\nIs there any way to have photos in a shared album sort by the photo date instead of the upload date?  Is this really not an option in Apple's photo sharing scheme?  The only way I can think of to achieve what I want is either to switch to some other technology, like Picasa, or to download all the photos to Photos on a laptop and then upload the sorted photos to the shared album.  That seems ridiculous in 2015.\nAs a follow-up, what is the best way to deliver feedback to Apple?  The \"Provide Feedback...\" option that used to be there in iPhoto is missing.\n\nA: There is not really a way to sort a shared album by date taken. I don't think that will be a feature because Apple is trying to make it like Instagram where the posts pop up in the order they were shared and not the date they were taken.\n\nA: You cannot reorder in iCloud. You can copy all the pictures to a new album and sort by date. You can then create a new shared album from that album and it will be sorted bt date since it is one upload. Awkward but it works.\n\nA: It's not possible in the MacOS version of Photos as far as I can see, but in the iPhone version, you can do it by opening the album and clicking the three dots the top right corner. From the menu now select \"Sort\" and then the type of sort you'd like to perform. I imagine this would work on iPad as well.\nUpdate: Turns out that this only works for the device on which it's done. Other devices does not see this sorting unfortunately.\n", "Q: How to play Apple Music and Radio (Beats 1) on iTunes?

The heart button isn't tappable sometimes while listening to Beats 1 radio on Apple Music. Why is that?\n\nA: Well, since Music just came out a couple of hours ago, there is probably a lot of people checking it out and lagging the servers. It could also be that you have an older device and Apple hasn't optimized Apple Music for your device yet so its lagging. I had the same problem and I have the iPhone 4s.\n", "Q: Have hearts replaced star ratings in iOS 8.4 with Apple Music/iTunes Match? I have been rating songs for a VERY long time, have several playlists using star ratings, etc. \nYou used to be able to click on an album and 'flip' it in iOS and could see the ratings of your music.

For instance, you could use your notebook for an hour or more one day, using half its charge, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so it may take several days to complete a cycle.\n\nSo essentially, as long as you ever run the laptop unplugged at all, your cycle count will slowly increase.\n\nA: For example, if you discharge your battery halfway one day, then halfway again the next day, this counts as one cycle, not two.\nIn your case discharging to 80% it will take 5 times before a cycle is counted. (5x20% =100%) = 1 cycle.\nFully drained = 1 cycle.\nDraining is not recommended.\n", "Q: Floor Plan software for Mac Is there a free program that can make floor plans on a Mac?

Free, not a huge selection of shapes when it comes to floor plans, but very easy to use for making an office desk plan or something like that. \n", "Q: My iPod 5th Gen won't turn on I have an iPod Touch 5th gen and I use a cheap £1 charger to charge it up.\nRecently my iPod ran out of battery so I plugged it in using the charger and the iPod was completely unresponsive.\nI tried everything including rebooting it, after that I took it to a local repair shop and he 'repaired' it for me but again my iPod ran out of charge and it won't come on again.\nWhat do I do? \nP.S : I have been using cheap chargers for a while now so it's only a recent problem, also if I bought an official Apple charger would it solve this issue? \n\nA: hold the power button and home button at the same time until the white apple logo appears be patient whenever this happens its a minor glitch in the iOS \n", "Q: How do I report a spam/fake radio station in the list of iTunes internet radio?

There is a monitoring system to monitor the panels inverter via a wireless connection to their gateway that connects via Ethernet to my Airport Extreme router. I would like to setup that Ethernet connection so it is secure from my home network but is able to send the required information that it is supposed to provide to the Solar Companies' portal. Is there a way of providing this separate access either via another router or directly via my Airport Extreme?\n\nA: You can set up an Airport Extreme with a guest network {Apple.com}. This is entirely separate from your in-home network even though it runs on the Airport. In this case it would be kind of like setting up a home network 'DMZ' that keeps some services away from the main network at-large.\n", "Q: Good Thunderbolt network cards for Mac? I need another network card for my Macbook Air because of virtual OS which cannot use same network card as Yosemite. \nMy friend says that he has Thunderbolt network card which he can use to connect to two internet through two OSes: one default and one virtual.\nI would like to get the similar tools.\nWhich are options to get second network card for Macbook air or similar Mac?\n\nA: If you'd like to add wired network (Ethernet) ports to your MacBook Air you have the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*A single or dual Thunderbolt network adapter. Apple makes one, the MD463ZM, but only with a single network port. There are third party adapters that provided more than one port - for example the Sonnet Twin 10G. There are also Thunderbolt docks that contain single Ethernet ports (for example from Sonnet, Belkin, CalDigit, etc).\n\n*One or more USB ethernet adapters.\n\n\nNote - as the MacBook Air only has a single Thunderbolt port, if you use that port for an Ethernet adapter you cannot use an external display at the same time. One way to work around that is by using one of the Thunderbolt docks described above.\nThe most cost effective route is probably to get a single port Thunderbolt adapter and a USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter. If you'd like to use an external display at the same time as the two Ethernet ports, get a Thunderbolt dock instead of a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter.\n", "Q: Syncing Apple Music between iPhone and iPad How do you sync playlists, favorites, etc between devices in the new Apple Music app?\n\nA: All you need to do is turn on \"iCloud Music Library\" and all of your playlists, saved songs etc. will be distributed to all of your devices (including PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod and iPad (and soon to be android and Apple TV))\nTo do this, on iDevices go to Settings>Music>iCloud Music Library.\n", "Q: Network, wifi, advance I've have found these on System Preferences: Wifi, Advance then Proxies.\nWhy do I need to use passiveftp mode (pasv) and Bypass proxy settings for those Hosts & Domains.: *.local, 169.254 16\nI don't have any FTP or either a Domain Account. \n\nA: You should clear all the proxy settings unless you know you need to route some or all internet traffic through one single point of failure and slowdown.\n", "Q: How Can I Convert A .TXT File To A .CSV File Without Losing Any Of The Content Of That Document? I've been trying for about 4 days now to complete the seemingly simple activity of converting an OS X keychain text dump to a correctly formatted .csv with no progress, much less success. I posted a different question about my predicament yesterday, which has gone without comment or suggestion.\nI am simply trying to convert a .txt file to a formatted .csv file, without losing any of the contents of the original document in the process.\nWhat I have already tried:\n(1) RWest's Gist and Ben-Oni and christophervalles variations thereof. The main ingredient of this script is a keychain.rb file and I think this would work if I only knew how to add in entry fields to match all the fields in the original document. However, I don't know the formula and have been unable to find a template.

'txt' files are meant for text, and 'csv' files are ment for data storage, but it are both just text files.\nAdd on:\nThe data looks organised like a dictionary type (or like a multidimensional array). A dictionary can not be converted to a 2D dataframe structure (like csv or excel) as it can have more dimensions than 2. What you want is not possible.

Usually my Mac performs pretty comfortably but for the last hour or so it's been almost unusable. When I type it takes a few seconds to actually display what I've typed or just beachballs for a little while. If I try to open a new tab in Safari it takes about half a minute to actually appear.\nWhen I opened Activity Monitor to see if I could work out what was happening \"softwareupdated\" was taking 100% CPU and Memory Pressure is in the red. I tried opening the App Store application to see if that would tell me but the application just opens but won't draw any content.\n\nI didn't tell my Mac to update anything, and the App Store app seems useless right now, so how do I find out what is it doing that is causing this?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Fixed this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to system preferences\n\n*click on app store\n\n*un-click \"Automatically check for updates\"\n\n\nProblem solved!\n\nA: I solved this by rebooting and installing OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 Combo Update.\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/28476636#28476636\n\nA: If you open the Console application I believe it defaults to \"All Messages\" which might not provide any useful information.\nHowever if you open the Console application, then open the \"/var/log\" option at the bottom of the left-hand source pane you should find an entry for \"install.log\". If you select that you should see some information on what softwareupdated is actually doing, or trying to do, to your machine.\n\nA: For me kill -9 softwareupdated led to a requester to reboot the mac being shown. After the reboot the installation started. Nothing seems to be broken at the moment, but now I am a bit scared.\n", "Q: With the new Apple Music app is there a way to sort my music by Album?

I had the same problem.\nGo to Settings → Music → Sort Albums and change this to By Title.\n", "Q: Is it possible to save a song \"station\" in Apple Music? When I play a song in Apple Music and select \"Start Station\" to begin an ad-hoc radio station based on that song, is there a way to capture the results for later, i.e. to replay the station or turn it into a playlist? \nOr can I only return to the original song and hit Start Station again?\n\nA: Here's what I found to kind of do this:\nOnce you play a song and start a \"station,\" that song will be saved to the \"Recently Played\" section of Radio. So if you want to start that \"station\" again later, just go to Radio, choose the song from the \"Recently Played\" section and the station will pick up again. \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Why wont siri use wifi?

In the new Apple Music app, which came with iOS 8.4, some albums are grayed out and marked with an \"E\". I cannot open them.\nI did a Google search. In some posts, I read that Apple uses an \"E\" symbol for explicit material. However, I did not find any information specifically related to the Music app.\nI've looked for settings both in the Music app as well as in the Settings app under Music but could not find anything related to this question.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does the \"E\" symbol mean?\n\n*Is there any way to open such albums?\n\n\nA: The E symbol means \"Explicit\".\nYou can enable or disable explicit content within Settings on your device. You'll find the \"ALLOW MUSIC & PODCASTS RATED\" option under General -> Restrictions -> Music & Podcasts.\nYou may need to enter a PIN code to access the Restrictions settings.\nYou can disable the restrictions entirely by selecting the \"Disable Restrictions\" option at the top of the Restrictions window.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with E's showing up when in iTunes, even though I could still listen, because no restrictions were set. I have issues with censorship and didn't want those E's being rammed up my nose every time I opened iTunes. So, I discovered that there's another setting under the Restrictions tab in iTunes/Preferences..., for showing a particular country's restrictions in the library. Uncheck that option and you don't have to see them anymore.\n", "Q: Apple Music: separate logins & preferences per family member I have a very old Apple ID (that was set up before you used email addresses) that I use for all my family's iTunes purchases. I enter that in iTunes logins on all our iPhones, Macs and the Apple TV.\nMy wife and I each have .mac addresses that we use as Apple IDs for use with iCloud, which we separately enter on our own iPhones and Macs.\nWith Family Sharing enabled, is there a way for both of us to log into Apple Music with our iCloud/individual Apple IDs and maintain separate profiles that are based on our own individual music tastes, maintain separate \"followings\" etc? Or does it have to be based on our common iTunes-related Apple ID? So far it appears I'm forced to log into Apple Music with the latter and everything has to be lumped together, but it's confusing and I may be missing something.\nI've contacted Apple Support about this, but I keep getting stock support answers that don't address my question.\n\nA: I don't know if it's intended functionality, but it appears to be working the way I want now. Here's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Logged out of both iTunes and iCloud on my devices and started over.\n\n*Logged into iTunes account on both our iPhones and Macs with old Apple ID we use for all purchases. Logged into iCloud on our iPhones and Macs with our own .mac accounts.\n\n*I enabled Family Sharing using my iCloud/.mac address and invited my wife using her iCloud/.mac address.\n\n*I logged into Apple Music with the Apple ID associated with purchases. My wife logged into Apple Music with her iCloud/.mac address used for Family Sharing. \n\n\nOnce logged in, we both were able to pick our music types and artists. It looks like we were both pre-set to follow an identical list of many, if not all (245 artists) from music we've bought in iTunes over the years. But, while there were a few glitches I noticed the first couple of times I opened the app, Apple Music on my iPhone and Mac appear to be retaining all my preferences after following & unfollowing some artists, and vice versa on my wife's iPhone and Mac.\nIn the end, it seems relatively straightforward, but it didn't work at all the first couple of times through (which may have simply been launch day weirdness) and I couldn't find any official support info that outlined if this was possible. Hope this helps someone else.\n", "Q: Backup Time capsule content for later restore I am selling my Time Capsule. I would like to back up its contents so that when I get a new one later, I can restore its contents back. There is a documented way to backup and restore to a new time capsule if you have both the old and new devices available. \nHow can I backup the contents to a hard drive so that I can restore it later to a new Time Capsule? Can I just copy the contents?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the replacement back up device first.\n\n*Let the replacement drive finish at least one complete back up.\n\n*Secure shred the data on the old one.\n\n", "Q: I dismissed \"For You\" in iTunes 12.2 for Mac, How do I get it back? Context\nOS X 10.10.4 (14E46)\niTunes 12.2.0.145\nQuestion\nI just installed iTunes 12.2 for OS X, the first version of iTunes with new Apple Music features. \nAfter installing (which went perfectly smoothly AFAICT), I launched the new iTunes (with the new white icon). There was a new tab in the top center called For You. I clicked on this tab, and was shown a screen with a lot of exciting For You content. Then I clicked a text link on this page that said Go to My Music.\nI was taken back to the My Music tab, and the For You tab disappeared entirely. I didn't expect that For You would completely disappear if I clicked that text link. I'd like to get the For You tab back.\nI've searched thru the iTunes main menu, and thru the iTunes (modal) Preferences window, and thru my iTunes Account Info page in vain. I cannot find any way to reinstate the For You tab. How can I get the For You tab back?\n\nA: OP Here. I found two ways to reinstate the For You tab.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is also a setting for this in the iTunes Preferences Window after all:\nPreferences > General > Show Apple Music\n\n\n\n*Alternatively, in the main menu, click Account > Apple Music…. This will make the For You tab and another New tab return. Although the content under the For You tab is now gone, and in its place there's just a button for trying Apple Music and another for Go to my Music.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In the View menu, select Music (⌘1) \n\n*If you don't see words like \"My Music, Playlists, For You, New, Radio, Connect...\" then continue.\n\n*In the Account menu, select Sign Out\n\n*Then sign back in and repeat the first step ⌘1\n\n\n\nThe For You tab is generated by Apple's servers, so any busy-ness there or overload can cause it to be blank. You might also need to go through the steps to identify which genres and then artists you like and which ones you love a second time if your initial elections didn't get saved properly to the cloud.\nWorst case - check Apple's System Status page - http://apple.com/support/systemstatus and consider reaching out to Apple Support if your account doesn't clear itself out over an 8 hour period or more.\n", "Q: Difference between unlocked iPhone and carrier iPhone I want to buy an iPhone 5S and I think it's not directly from apple but it's from a carrier. what I want to know is the difference between the official version and this version, besides the fact that carriers' phones may only use one carrier SIM... I'm asking about software \"or\" hardware differences \n\nA: An unlocked phone is sometimes called a SIM-Free or contract-free phone. Unlocking means that you can use your phone with a different carrier. Hope this will help you. \n", "Q: How to upgrade multiple Macs to OS X 10.10.4? I own multiple Macs at home and, when I installed Yosemite (10.10) I downloaded the installer from the App Store on the main computer, then copied \"/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite\" to a safe location, and used the copy to upgrade the other computers skipping the long download time.\nNow that the upgrade to 10.10.4 is available, I noticed that there is no \"Install\" executable in /Applications - so I had to repeat the long download for all my three computers.  How could I use a single download for all computers again?\n\nA: For every OS X 'delta' release  - 10.10.1/2/3/ ...10.10.4 etc - which App Store will download to each Mac there is a simultaneous 'combo' update release which rolls up all the previous deltas into one single downloadable update.\nIt was for many years considered the 'pro' way to do the update, as it can also correct potential update issues that the delta can't.\nYou can always find updates related to OS X here.\nAs the combo update doesn't use the App Store \"download, install, delete\" structure, you can pass it from machine to machine at your leisure.\nMaybe not as slick as using the server - but it's free ;-)\nFrom comments -\nThe combo update can also be applied to machines which are already running the current version of the OS, unlike the App Store's delta \"update\" mechanism. This can sometimes correct issues that may linger after doing a series of incremental [delta] updates.\nThe combo updater is invariably larger than the incremental updates; but it is worth it, just for the peace of mind.\n\nA: The OS X Server App allows you to cache data on your network as well as manage multiple devices and installations/updates on them. This would simplify things for you in the long run, but there might be a slight learning curve to start out. I haven't used the Yosemite version of the Server App yet so can't give you more specifics. It's something to look into anyway to streamline your process.\n", "Q: Missing songs don't add from iCloud Music How can I download some staff, that has add link, which don't work properly? I'm trying to redownload, testing on different albums - not help (but not every album has such problem, frequently all tracks are on there places). Not working in mac iTunes, iPhone & iPad.\n\n\nA: Today I suddenly understand... I cannot add these missing files because I have already them in other albums. Maybe it's a big problem for someone, but I just delete albums that are \"no so good\" and keep \"that really rock\". So problem solved! Thanks for watching!\n", "Q: New iTunes App installation After updating my iTunes to the new 12.2.0.145 I can no longer manage the apps on my iPhone 6+ from iTunes.  The apps show up and there is the install/uninstall buttons beside them, but they are grayed out and unavailable.  \nAnyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?  \n\nA: Did you update to iOS 8.4 yet?\nIf not, now would be the time.  \nIn iTunes - sync; backup; update. \nIf you're already on 8.4, then sync; backup; restore.\n", "Q: Disable notifications during a call on iPhone 5 iOS 8.3 While I am talking on the phone, I often receive messages on Telegram or WhatsApp, or other notifications. And when I receive them they arrive in bursts, which is really annoying.\nIs there a way to disable this behaviour? How do I disable notifications only when I’m talking?\niPhone 5 with iOS 8.3\n\nA: This is not possible (at least on a non-jailbroken phone).\nYou can use Do Not Disturb, but you have to set it ahead of time so that it applies even while the phone is unlocked, and then toggle it on at the start of the call, and toggle it off at the end.\n\nA: Go to notifications in settings and then turn off banners and sounds for those specific app notifications. The only way they should notify you is with the red app badge number. \nIf you want no notifications from the app, just turn it off.\nDo Not Disturb is also useful to set up.\n", "Q: Stuck at the boot screen I'm running Yosemite. While booting up I get stuck at the screen with the following screen.\nIs it a serious issue? If yes, how can I save my data?\n\nA: The prohibitory means the system has found an installed OS but was unable to boot it. \nYour possibilities are : \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into safe mode (Hold shift at boot and if it boots, fixing your permissions \n\n*Backing you drive using another Mac and Target Disk Mode\n", "Q: Where is the search functionality in Apple Music? I have just installed the new iTunes 12.2, and activated Apple Music through the iPhone app. \nDespite the too many buttons on top, it all seems confusing. I just want a simple search for streamable music. There is Radio, My Music, New etc. \n\nBut where can I stream an artist I like, who is not shown yet\n  to me through those options?\n\nIs there a functionality inside iTunes or the Music app in iOS?\n\nA: You can search directly from the search box in iTunes. Just type artist name and you will get suggestions. You can select the artist name and you will be shown all the songs and albums. There you can stream. Also you can use the iOS Music application search functionality for your favourite artists.\n\n", "Q: Where is my 'Wallet' app (ios8.4) This may be a UK problem, Apple pay was launched in the UK today and it coincided with an update to ios8.4.\nBut I still have Passbook.. Is there a way of turning on wallet or has it simply not been launched in the UK yet?\n\nA: The Wallet app is coming with iOS 9, and is not yet supported in iOS 8.4.\nI've tested iOS 9 in Germany, and it will be supported in every country. They 'just' changed the name (and introduce a collective place for Apple Pay in the future).\nSource\n\nA: Apple Pay will be launched in the UK \"in July\" and has not yet been released.\nThe Passbook app becomes Wallet with the release of iOS9 in the autumn.\n\nA: 'Wallet' is an ios9 feature.

It's commonly used in boot environments and embedded systems due its wide platform support and small size.\n", "Q: To have RAM-based filesystem in OSX? I would like do real-time monitoring, discussing one part of it here about counting quickly. \nNo packages about it in homebrew. \nHow can you have RAM-based filesystem in OSX?\n\nA: Mac OS includes support for RAM-based filesystems via ramfs. Everything is RAM backed so it's incredibly fast with near zero latency, but the contents are lost upon reboot.\nTo create one and mount it under /tmp/mymount, create a script with the following contents and run it:\n#!/bin/sh\nNUMSECTORS=128000       # a sector is 512 bytes\nmydev=`hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$NUMSECTORS`\nnewfs_hfs $mydev\nmkdir /tmp/mymount\nmount -t hfs $mydev /tmp/mymount\n\nThe above was adapted from the hdiutil manual page\nYou can also do it in a one-liner (adapted from here):\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://XXXXX)\n\nWhere XXXXX is the size in 2048 byte blocks.

I'd like to enable HFS+ compression for a directory, applying it to both the existing files in that directory and newly copied files. I expect to be able to read and write the contents of that directory normally.\nDoes HFS+ treat non-compressible files intelligently, say by trying to compress the first few KB of the file and bailing if it doesn't compress? I don't want non-compressible files expanding or their access significantly slowed down by compression and de-compression.\nIs this possible to do out of the box in Yosemite? I'm also open to installing a third-party app (even a command-line one) to enable the compression, if I can then uninstall it later and have the directory retain the compression.\nI found afsctool, but it hasn't had a release or update in an year and a half, and I don't want to use unmaintained software. Besides, afsctool works only for existing files, not newly copied ones.\n\nA: The compression is supported by HFS+ file-system out of box, however macOS by default doesn't compress any files.\n\nafsctool\nThere is a afsctool command-line utility which can transparently compress the files, for example:\nafsctool -c some_dir\n\nInstall via: brew install afsctool.\n\nditto\nWhen copying files, use ditto, e.g.\nditto --hfsCompression src dst\n\n\nWhen copying files or extracting content from an archive, all the content will be compressed if appropriate.\n\nTo check whether a file is compressed using HFS+ compression or not, you can use hfsdebug.

From what I've read so far I need a DDNS service to provide me a static address to my server. I subscribed to one and configured a their client on my server to hourly update the IP. \nNow I have a host address that I don't know what to do with it, it does not provide me any of the services my server provides when I try to access it… Do I have to open some ports?\n\nA: I've been doing exactly what you describe for 8 years, it works just fine.\nI assume you set up Server with your internal IP address, and that it is a fixed IP on the local network? Server does NOT like having it's IP address changed.\nThe external address can change 10 times a day. You say you already have a domain and a dynamic update service - I assume it's one that updates your domain A record when your external address changes? All good.\nYes, you will have to forward a ton of ports. This is another reason you need a fixed ip address on your LAN.

Someone with a Mac could easily use yours as a hard drive and access all the files. Hopefully you didn't encrypt them and now have to pay ransom to the villains to get the recovery key.

I was also seeing CPU percentages close to 500%.\nI did three things that seem to have fixed this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed the laptop's retina monitor to be the main one.\n\n*In System Preferences > Energy Saver, I unchecked \"Automatic graphics switching.\"\n\n*In System Preferences > Mission Control, I unchecked \"Displays have separate Spaces.\"\n\n\n\nA: I'm having a similar issue with a 2011 13\" MBP8,1 (2.7Ghz i7 CPU and HD3000 graphics), and to me it's pretty certain that it's provoked by video-intensive operations. Curiously, Hardware Monitor showed temperatures in the 70C range, quite far from the 90+C temperatures I've already seen while running big compile jobs.\nI removed the bottom plate and removed far more very fine dust from the fan and its vents than I'd have expected, and blowing over the logic board dislodged even more. On the 13\" model, the fan can be removed with just 3 screws after removing the bottom plate, so it's easy enough to clean (careful with the connector!). I haven't used the system much since, but 1st impressions were that the fan was much more effective again, and that the issue was gone.\nNext steps will be running without the bottom plate and reducing my external screen's resolution from 1920*1080 to 1680*1080 (res. of my previous panel with which I never had problems, and a resolution that's clearly easier on the GPU for video playback).\nI never understood why anyone would want to connect an external screen and NOT use the \"internal\" at the same time (saving battery? I just turn off the backlight in that case ...)\n\nA: This is a design feature documented by Apple. The intel design is power hungry and now that we see Apple Silicon we see efficiency taking more of a design role so cooling systems don’t need to be so bulky. For any Mac in thermal pressure (too hot inside), see if cooling the case and area around your Mac lets the processor can then speed up again, use. Ore energy and do the work you want while in clamshell mode.\n\n*\n\n*Any reason not to run my Macbook Pro upside-down in clamshell mode?\nSome people have luck removing Intel kernel extensions, but if you disable safety and overheat your system, that might be out of warranty if the cpu fails.\n\n*\n\n*rMBP kernel_task spikes when connecting more than one external monitor\nI would watch things closely if you do that and try other cooling methods first, like buy a stand designed to cool your Mac.\n\n*\n\n*http://www.svalt.com\nIf that doesn't work, try resetting the System Management Controller one time to ensure it's not a measurement error.\nIf you only need occasional cooling or to convince yourself, go ahead and open the clamshell and make sure there is good ventilation and you are not blocking the air inlet or outlet by the display hinges. The thermal management software reacts quite rapidly to changes in internal temperature.  could even use Magnets to force the display to sleep while it's actually open and allowing the entire keyboard surface to be exposed and cooling the Mac that thinks it's still working in closed clamshell mode.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203184\n\nActivity Monitor may show that a process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you may notice a lot of fan activity. This process helps manage temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using the CPU intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot. When the temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity.\n\nSo, also quit the other tasks and apps you don't need if you can't make the physical arrangement of the Mac more cool or more conducive to radiating the heat away if convection isn't working for you. The GPU will cause lots of heat if it's pushing many pixels. Decreasing resolution might help in an edge case, but you'll want to attack cooling in general as a first step.\nYou could also get some advanced tools to peek into the CPU rate to confirm it's reacting to heat:\n\n*\n\n*kernel_task hundreds of % CPU yet cpu frequency is being lowered\n\nA: Have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) and was having 300-600+% cpu usage from kernel_task. After reading some speculation online about it being a safeguard to prevent overheating, I started to wonder why my machine couldn't handle outputting to three monitors. Following the instructions here, I looked and saw none of the applications I was running were using the high-end card. After going into System Preferences > Energy Saver and disabling Automatic graphics switching (forcing the high-end card to always be used), the issue seems to be resolved.\n\nA: I have a simpler fix and one that I read on another thread. I doubted this would work but it did! I purchased a USB powered cooling pad for my 15\" Retina mid-2012. I use both of my Thunderbolt ports to power two Dell 24\" monitors via their Display port connections. \nBefore I either had to disconnect the secondary monitor or use the lower res HDMI port off my laptop to stop the runaway CPU kernal_task issue.

Keep the can upright to avoid liquid coming out. The liquid is cold enough to damage delicate components. Spray in short bursts for the same reason. Also short bursts should help avoid spinning up the fans to some extent, which is thought to be potentially damaging (allegedly, I am not entirely convinced of this danger, but may be wrong!).\nA safer and more complete option would be to take the machine to an Apple Genius Bar or other laptop repair place (if out of warranty) and get it opened and cleaned.\nI was surprised how unplugging the monitor would immediately result in the kernel_task process dropping back to normal. So the fact that it was purely temperature related wasn't easy to see, since I'd expect more of a lag for kernel_task to calm down as the temperature declined.\nI believe that, at least in my case, this is the true fix for the issue.\nNote that, as mentioned in some other answers, the behaviour of kernel_task is deliberate: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359 Which says:\n\nOne of the functions of kernel_task is to help manage CPU temperature\n  by making the CPU less available to processes that are using it\n  intensely.\n\n\nA: High temperature in a part of the chassis from charging together with peripherals plugged in can cause this issue, at least on a 2017 MBP.

Other applications update just fine. I noticed this when I tried to update Xcode yesterday. Upon clicking the update button, it greys out without ever beginning the update process. This has left me unable to update my version of Xcode, OS X or iTunes.\nI know that I can just download the DMG files from the developer library, but that seems like an unnecessary step.\nHas anyone experienced anything like this in the past? \n\nA: Give that this is an older question, I’m hoping that @wadda_wadda has solved his Mac OS X App Store update problem.\nFor those who might encounter this problem in the future, or need a way of forcing an app update here’s a method that will hopefully help.\nIf you want to see what updates your system already has on it for a specific app, or any app for that matter, check out this How to view Software Update history? Q&A here on Ask Different.\n\nBecause the Software Update app can occasionally get stuck in a strange update cycle. Here’s an alternative method to check for, and install Apple App Store app updates via the command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the App Store app has been quit BEFORE you start this process.\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Because some updates require Admin privileges to install. It is recommended by Apple that you start off by switching to Super User privileges. To do this type sudo -s in the terminal, then enter your system password. This will ONLY work if you are an Administer on the system.\n\n\n*Now that you are super, at the command prompt in terminal type the following command:softwareupdate --list\n\n\n*This should return a list of updates available for your system. Although it might come back with No new software available.This usually means that your system is up to date. BUT, if you know there are new updates available for software on your system. Then either the update isn’t currently available from the server that you’ve reach on Apple’s side (which can happen when a new update has just come out and the serves are super busy), OR it could be that your systems update .plist file isn’t happy (read the How to view Software Update history? to see where this is).\n\n*Because the command line check didn’t come back with anything doesn’t mean it hasn’t “magically” (yes I know it isn’t magic) fixed the .plist file. That’s why I recommend launching the standard App Store app again at this point (you did quit it back in step 1 right?), and hitting the update tab to check for updates. There's been more than one time that I’ve had this work, and was able to just run the newly found updates directly from within the App Store app without having to do anything more. If that is the case for you, then you can quit the Terminal app at this point, and you are done.\n\n\n*If however you still aren’t getting the app updates you know are available, or if command line DID find updates (back in step 5) but the App Store app still isn’t seeing them. You need to quit the App Store app again, and switch back to Terminal.\n\n*If the command line software update DID find updates, and you just want to install ALL of the updates, then type softwareupdate -iva at the command line, and let the magic happen.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*IF you only want to install the \"recommended updates” you can type softwareupdate -ivr at the command line instead.\n\n*OR you can also install just a specific update (or force and update) by typing softwareupdate -i NAME.OF.APP.#VERSION where NAME.OF.APP.#VERSION is the listed app name and version number found back in step 5. For example the image below would install the Pro Apps QuickTime Codecs update 1.0:\n\n\n\n*STILL NO JOY! - At this point you can force an install of an app update you know exist, BUT you need to know the package naming to run the command line install (like the example above). Finding the proper package name is much harder than it might sound, and seems to change with each release of the Mac OS unfortunately.  There is an open source package manager for Mac system admins that can be used to find the list of apps, but it’s not for novice or even intermediate users. So use at your own risk. https://github.com/munki/munki\nAlternatively you can download several Apple updates directly from the Apple Support site or the developers site, but these are only for Apple products (which in the case of the original question would work). https://support.apple.com/downloads/\nA final note.\nIf you are using a developer version of an app and/or install a beta version of an app from the Apple Developer site. The Apple App Store Update will most likely NOT work, and WON’T see any app updates on your system. In this case you need to completely uninstall the developer or beta version of the app in question, and download the released version of the app from the App Store. This has bitten many a developer and beta tester before with the Mac OS. So just be aware that if you choose to download a beta or developer version of an app, or even the Mac OS. You might have to take extra steps to get your system back to a point where normal App Store Updates work properly.\n", "Q: Stuck at OS X Utilities while clean installing Yosemite I decided to do a clean Yosemite install on my Macbook Pro 13 inch Mid-2012 . So I made a boot able USB from terminal. Then I booted from it and went into disk utility and erased my current Disk which was Macintosh HD. Then I closed disk utility and clicked install OS X. As soon as I double clicked it the continue button grayed out and nothing is happening. I can move around the cursor which means it hasn't hung. I rebooted to the boot able USB and again clicked it and again the button grayed out. I have been waiting now for about 10 to 15 minutes and nothing has happened yet. What should I do?\n\nThis is where I am stuck.\n\nA: This sounds like the install you created is faulty somehow, possibly either a bad file copy or a bad flash drive.\nThings to try, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebuild the install drive using the same method you used before, but on a new drive.\n\n*Use the built-in recovery options (hold cmd R) to do the install. Then, upgrade to the latest version of OS X. By upgrading to the newer OSX, your recovery partition will be set to do a clean upgrade of El Capitan if you have to do it again.\n\n*If that doesn't work (say your recovery partition is trashed), there's the Internet Recovery option, which will actually reinstall the OS your mac shipped with.\n", "Q: To install GNU time in OSX?

I have a Mac mini (Late 2009) (hw.model: Macmini3,1, 2 GB RAM) that I've got hooked on my TV primary as a \"media consumption\" device... but a while ago I updated it to:\nMac-mini:~ javier$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.8.5\nBuildVersion:   12F2518\n\nand it crawls along, which is quite painful. I'm debating whether upgrading it to Mavericks or Yosemite might bring some relief for performance... I don't need a blazing computer, but taking 2 minutes to load VLC is a bit too much IMO...\nI have thought about upgrading the RAM and maybe getting a better (larger) HD as 160 GB isn't too much these days, but I don't know if that might be throwing money down the sink...\nThanks in advance for any tips!\n\nA: The answer to your question, in short: It is always advised that you have the latest possible OS for your computer. This is due to the myriad of bug fixes and security patches that come along with new OS updates and intermediary releases.\nI would suggest bumping up the RAM to the highest possible as well, but at least to 4GB. This should result in an immediate performance boost and result in smoother system operation. Switching the HDD can also help, but is less urgent.\nIf all else fails, you can always try restoring the operating software to a new state. Often, systems will change over time and become loaded down with old/unpatched/inefficient software and/or changes made to files that result in degraded performance. A new clean wipe will ensure you are running the best software available for the machine.\n\nA: I have found that while my mac mini late 2009 was usable upto mavericks, it wasnt a nice experience mainly due to apples aweful choice of the super slow 5200rpm 2.5 inch hd (it was subpar even when it was launched).\nSo instead of going all out ssd (which would be best performance, but costly to get 1gb of space), I opted to buy a hybrid hard drive (this one: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-Laptop-Solid-State-Hybrid/dp/B00BHRWHNI), this is basically a small ssd with a large normal hd.\nOn mavericks it made the mac mini feel like a new mac! The drive basically moves the most common apps and files to the ssd part and so you get mad speed most of the time. all at £60 - you cant that kind of bang for your buck with pure ssd.\nPlus, now with el capitan update, the mac is faster still.\nI still have the option of replacing the ram (currently at 4gb), which will probably the last thing I can do to this little machine.\n\nA: I've strived to get at least 10 years of life out of all my Macs starting back in the 80's.\nSo when I updated to OS X 10.11, El Capitan, on my late 2009 Mac Mini I felt like something was dying.\nNeedless to say, the 2GB RAM is not sufficient but a very affordable 8GB upgrade (US$46) was well worth it. Now all my newer OS devices play nice and I'm happy to push onward for four more years.\n\nA: I have a Mac Mini late 2009 as well. I upgraded the HD to an SSD and the RAM to the max 8GB.  Runs faster than a new i5 notebook with similar specs. There's life in the old girl yet.  After 7 years needed to replace the CPU fan, and the Magic Mouse died. USB mouse solved that but I lost he swipe capabilities. Nice little box.\n\nA: I run 10.6.8 and have absolutely no problem with the OS or specific apps \"crawling along\" (I have 4GB RAM and a spinning disk HD). I am using it to stream videos on Netflix and Amazon without issue. Judging from your question I would thus advise other users against updating OSX to versions later than 10.6.8. These \"upgrades\" may compatible with such an old Mac Mini but may bring it to a crawl. (The only problem with having such an outdated version of the OS is that it is no longer possible to update Chrome & Firefox to the most recent versions. This together with an old OS probably constitutes an overall security issue.)\n", "Q: iCloud storage full: \"Not Enough Storage\". Backups exceed 5GB \nJust like everyone else, I get the notification that my iCloud is full and no backup can be made. iOS gives me the suggestion to upgrade my storage on my iCloud account. Because I only want to store my settings, phone numbers and other 'light' stuff, I see no reason to upgrade. I think a few gigabytes should be more than plenty to backup my device(s).\nWhat is taking all the space on my iCloud?\nFirst I checked on my Mac - OS X Mavericks\nOn OS X I have checked the following in 'System Preferences' -> 'iCloud':\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup 4.44 GB\n\n*Documents 550.7 MB\n\n*Mail 5 MB\n\n\n\nOkay, my major storage exists of the type 'Backup'. I Guess these are the backups from my iPad and iPhone, but System prefs gives me no further clue. Lets look at my iPhone\nI got out my iPhone - iOS 8.4\nI go to 'Settings' -> 'iCloud':\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Drive ON\n\n*Photos ON\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library OFF\n\n*My Photo Stream OFF\n\n*iCloud Photo Sharing ON\n\n\n*Mail OFF\n\n*Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari, Notes, Passbook ON\n\n*Backup, Keychain, Find My iPhone ON\n\nThen I go to 'Settings' -> 'iCloud' -> 'Storage':\n\n\n*\n\n*Total storage 5.0 GB\n\n*Available 15.9 MB\n\n\n\nI go to 'Settings' -> 'iCloud' -> 'Storage' -> 'Manage Storage':\n\nLAST BACKUP FAILED\nAn additional 5 GB of storage is required.

What does my phone want to backup that takes 5.0 GB of space? Is there a way to visualise this? I only want to backup some settings and contacts, no major stuff...\nHow can I backup my stuff with the default 5 GB?\n\nA: The solution that worked for me tonight on an iPhone 7 running iOS 12.2 which was showing a \"next backup size\" of over 8 GB despite almost nothing on the phone being selected for inclusion in the iCloud backup was to change the \"Keep Messages\" duration at Settings > Messages from \"Forever\" to \"1 Year\".\n(This was despite Messages set to not use iCloud at Settings > [My Name] > Messages, in the \"APPS USING ICLOUD\" section of that page.)\nDoing this reduced the \"next backup size\" (as reported at Settings > [My Name] > Manage Storage > Backups > This iPhone > Backup Size to 3.6 GB, and allowed backup to iCloud (using my free 5 GB storage) to succeed.\nI also noted that Messages didn't appear at all in the list of apps at Settings > [My Name] > Manage Storage > Backups > This iPhone > Show All Apps.  Evidently, Messages data (including photos and videos sent and received?) is always included in iCloud backups?\n\nA: My answer is based on My personal experience, so this may or may not be valid for you.\nBased on the information provided by you, it reminded me of a similar situation I had face sometime back. iCloud not back's up the recent backup data but also saves the backup files backed up before, As in, If I created a backup today, and then I created a backup next week, it's going to keep both the data as I might want to go to the lower backed up version in case you want to restore from not the most recent version of the backup. It looks something like the image below. \nThat's what is clogging the space in your backup.\nP.S: This Link will explain how to restore to the not so recent backup proving my point as well.\n \n\nA: What to do when you do not have enough storage because your backup size is too large:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the current backup on your iCloud for that specific iOS device.\n\n*Your iCloud backup is now automatically turned off, so turn it back on.\n\n*A new backup is made and has a reasonable size.\n\n\nTheoretically your phone could crash in the short while you do not have a backup, so you could run an iTunes backup first.\n\n\nA: I was suffering from the same messages/issues as you? My iCloud back up contained all the apps that I have ever installed. I turned off the ones that had no importance to save and checked my storage, it showed that I had 4.5kb!\n", "Q: Iphone 5s: Can not find apple id I was wondering whether there is a way to find the appleid of an iphone that is stuck in the activation screen, when connecting it to itunes on a computer that was connected in the past.\nThanks a lot for your help.\n\nA: If you take it to the Apple Store or call AppleCare they'll be able to look this up for you, from your device's serial number.\n", "Q: Synology NAS - automatic mount in finder and permanent connection I've recently buy Synology DS215j and for almost everything it works fine.

Why? I am migrating from Spotify and I want iTunes to accommodate the way I used to add songs to a \"favorites\" playlist, just like the Starred Songs works on Spotify. \nInitially I created a Smart Playlist to self-update with all my hearted/loved tracks (let's call this Playlist 1). That didn't work because apparently the heart rating doesn't persist between devices, and most of the point of this is so I can have this self-updating playlist available offline on mobile. \nMy second solution was to create a non-smart playlist and manually update that one with any new music the smart playlist catches. (Let's call that Playlist 2.) That works (I can set this manual playlist to be kept accessible offline on my phone), but it's cumbersome to manually copy-paste songs every time I heart new tracks. \nMy third solution was to create another smart playlist especially made to mirror the first. (Let's call this Playlist 3.) The first playlist is set to auto-add any hearted tracks, but since this parameter doesn't carry to mobile, I made this second smart playlist that simply adds whatever music is added to the first. Essentially a mirror playlist, but with a different parameter. \nThis kinda works, but I get a strange error: \n\nThe playlist was created, and it works as I intended (successfully mirroring the first one at all times), but apparently I can't access it from other devices for some reason. \nWhy does this happen? The Playlist 3 contains exactly the same tracks as Playlist 1, so the given reason that Playlist 3 \"includes other media kinds or songs that are not eligible\" doesn't make any sense. \nAnyone knows why is this happening and/or how could I solve my initial problem?\nThanks!\n\nA: \"Playlists that reference other Playlists can not be uploaded\"\nIt took me awhile to figure out the solution to this problem, but I eventually did. You can no longer just drag and drop songs from Apple Playlists to new ones that you create yourself, but you are still able to do it a different way. You also used to be able to just right-click on a song, a menu would pop up, and you could then \"add to selected playlist\" - this no longer works either. \nSolution: if you go into any one of your Apple Music playlists, hover over any one of the songs, you will notice a little icon with 3 dots show up - if you LEFT-click on this, a menu will pop up (different than the old menu), and then add the song to your desired new self-made playlist. This seems to work.\nThe problem is that iTunes still has both the old method and the new method active, but only the new method actually works. \n\nA: This is what finally worked for me.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new playlist, and copy all songs from the problem playlist\n\n*In playlist, remove all downloads.  I did this by highlighting all songs, clicking on ..., and selecting 'remove download'.  \n\n*This make the download from iCloud icon appear next to all the songs\n\n*Then I had to go through and click each song to get it to redownload from iCloud.  About 10% of my songs would not download from iCloud.\n\n*I moved the 10% of bad songs to a temporary playlist and deleted them from the new playlist.  The new playlist would now sync to iCloud.  \n\n*I then dragged and dropped each song, 1 by 1, from the temp playlist back into my new playlist.  It wouldn't work if a dragged more than 1 at a time.  \n\n*After doing that, my new playlist synced to iCloud and all my devices. \n\n\nA: I saw this error when I added songs directly from the \"For You\" or \"New\" tabs in iTunes to a playlist.\nTo fix the error for my playlist I manually added the songs to My Library, then added them to a playlist. I was then able to sync that playlist.\n\nA: iCloud recently has had updates done which you check the system status at\nhere\nI had issues with creating new playlists from my phone. When I signed out and signed back into my iCloud account, this functionality came back. \nI am not sure if this will resolve your issue but could be an unseen issue as to why this may have happened.\n\nA: I found that I had some video files in my playlist that wouldn't sync/upload. These files has an icon next to them that identified them as non-uploadable. I deleted these from my playlist and booyaa!\n\nA: Here's a super quick fix I found that works instantaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Songs to view your entire music collection.\n\n*Command+A to select all your songs.\n\n*Right click and select Add to iCloud Music Library.\n\n\nOnce you do that, iTunes will upload the remainder of your library. The error should then resolve itself and you won't see that iCloud icon next to your playlist that originally couldn't be added.\nI hope this works for you!\n\nA: I've found that certain songs are available in Apple Music, but once you add them to an existing playlist it becomes un-syncable. Also it can't be shared. This is a real pain, specially because there is not warning as to which song is causing the issue. For example, if you don't own Ed Sheeran X album, try adding Sing. Boom.\n\nA: What about a ratings playlist? I've done this for years with my iTunes library and it's just a matter of creating a smart playlist for all songs rated five stars. You could import the Spotify list, select all, rate them five stars, and then they would automatically be added to the list. \nI'm doing this now with some minor success...my issue at the moment is that the smart playlist I created adds random unrated songs from albums in my library for no reason I can discern. \n\nA: I was having this problem and I managed to solve it by right clicking on the problem playlist and clicking \"duplicate.\" \nThe duplicated playlist had six fewer songs (which I suspect were the reason the original playlist couldn't be synced) but I was able to sync it to iCloud without any issues.  \n\nA: If you go to your playlist and tell it to arrange according to song, you can regain the ability to click the little cloud icon in the menu bar and sort this way.  If you see any clouds with lines through them, delete them from your playlist.  \nAlso make sure that you delete any music videos from your playlist.  \nBoth of these issues will keep the playlist from sharing across devices.  \n\nA: I found an easier way to fix this. In iTunes, go to preferences and turn off iCloud music library. Remove what's left - maybe re-add it through Apple Music? - then turn it back on. Problem solved :)\n\nA: Here’s what works:\nDouble click on the MP3 file and it will start playing oon iTunes\nClick on the 3 dots next to the song title now playing and select upload to iCloud music\nWatch the spinning arrow on the right. Click on it showing the progress of the upload\nWhen finished uploading, click on the 3 dots again and choose add to a playlist and you’re done.\nI tried with multiple files and it got stuck so do it one song at a time to be certain.\n\nA: I just started using Apple Music, and found that 1 of my playlists from iTunes wouldn't sync. It was a Smart Playlist that included 2 rules that referenced other playlists (e.g., don't include the song here if it is in one of those playlists.) Deleting those 2 rules fixed the issue so it will sync now, unfortunately, the playlist now has 1700 songs in it, and wasn't exactly the fix I hoped for.\n", "Q: Can you download Xcode on iPhone? Can you download Xcode on iPhone?\n\nA: Briefly, no.\nXcode is OS X only. You must have a Mac to download Xcode.\n", "Q: Could a 'damaged' TimeMachine backup still be of any use? I've got a Synology NAS here and a few months ago I sadly got the message, something like\n\nTime Machine backup is corrupt and therefor has to start a new backup.\n\nHowever, as my NAS is starting to get more and more filled, I'm seeking to kill some data. I found this old backup which is about 650GB of size. \nAnd my only question is: Can it be of any use or should I just remove it completely?\nIf you ask \"But by starting a new backup, the old one gets deleted. Why do you still have it?\" That's because it ended up in the Trash, instead of permanently deleted.\n\nA: The nature of Time Machine is such that it isn't an archival backup, as files deleted from the source drive will eventually disappear from the Time Machine backup set.1 If you have no other backup however, it might come in handy.\nIf the sparsebundle can be repaired, you'd be able to extract files from it. Following the instructions in the first green box of http://pondini.org/TM/A5b.html might let you access the backup set.\nIf you do gain access to it, you can use the Time Machine interface2 to remove all backups of folders you don't care about, but it might be tricky to cause the sparsebundle to take up less disk space.3\n\n1 See the text starting with \"Time Machine keeps\" in https://support.apple.com/HT201250\n2 \"Remove a backed-up item from your backup disk\" - https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11241\n3 \"Changing the size {…} of a sparse bundle\" - http://pondini.org/TM/A8.html\n\nA: Well. You reached to the point where all these so called NASes already not work. During development I did a big data transfers to the nas via smb. \n\n\n*\n\n*For 1gb or 10gb it works, but when we speak about 100gb or 10tb smb implementation in OS X will not gonna work. It may be bugs in smb implementation in OS X or smb implementation in your NAS. Or in both.\n\n*Another problem with smb is the internal cache. If you experience sudden mount point disconnect - your backup may not survive. \n\n*Another problem is you may not even notice that, before you try to extract the data.  \nIf you would like to use TimeMachine connect the drive directly to the computer. Or use Apple Time Capsule with original afp implementation. If you receive the error message, obviously some important(file table in dmg) data was corrupted. If your backup was encrypted imagine the consequences. Strictly saying if you do not check the backup(complete restore) you may think that your backup does not even exist. \nPersonally I recommend to use sftp if you would like to backup to remote disk. And you may try some third party software like immortal files or arc backup.\nAnd finally if your data is not located in three different physical location it does not simply exist. It is only the matter of time when is will disappear in the dust. \n", "Q: Finder copies files in two steps and does it as a transaction I need to organize thousands of files between different locations and there is an unpleasant issue with file copying from a local computer to a NAS. The problem is that Finder copies large bunch of files in two steps. In the first step it creates all those files in the destination location for a some reason, they are all empty there. It's a lengthy process. In the second step Finder actually starts copying content. It takes even more time. It looks like a transaction. Finder copies all files or nothing. But I don't need a transaction. In my opinion, a more common way is to copy files sequentially, one by one (or in a small groups). It's faster, it allows user to cancel copying in any time and prevents him from losing progress in operation.\nIs there any way to prevent Finder from doing such a transactionality and make it copy files sequentially in one step?\nLocal computer: MacBook Pro, OS X 10.10.4 (Yosemite).\nNAS: homebuilt server, FreeBSD 10.1 and Samba 4.2\nps: I do know about the alternative ways to copy files (console, file managers). My question is about the Finder and OS X behavior.\n\nA: From many years of experience* with transferring sets of many hundreds of thousands of files (with tens of thousands of nested folders,) the safest and quickest methods avoid the Finder completely and uses the console commands.\nDon't beat your head against the wall - Finder just won't do it satisfactorily.

There is no road within 2 miles.\nI can add it into the Notes field but minor pain to copy/paste each time I need the information.\n\nA: I would create new contact named \"the lodge near Au Sable Falls\" or your choice.\nThen in the home address enter the coordinate 44.181430, 73.965213\nIt will now allow you to show it on the map.\n\n\n\nA: If you convert your GPS coordinates to the right format, you can use URL’s like the ones below in your contacts (as homepage URL’s) and click them right from the contact and navigate in either Apple Maps or Google Maps.\nExamples (note that the %20 in the middle of the coordinates is an encoded space):\nhttp://maps.apple.com/?daddr=42°59'25.0\"N%2082°25'02.8\"W\nhttp://maps.google.com/?daddr=42°59'25.0\"N%2082°25'02.8\"W\nNOTE:  The above work from an iOS device.

These songs are accessible only during your Apple Music membership.\n\nNote that you do not need to 'join the subscription after the free trial period', Apple will just start charging your credit card for the subscription.\nThe point of offline files is so that you can listen to Apple Music without using up your mobile data usage, not to download music to keep forever.\n", "Q: Can I control audio/vibrate/DND on iOS remotely?

I listen to a lot of smart playlists based on ratings, and I use the grouping field for tags.  For example: Grouping Contains \"Mellow\", Rating is greater than **.  That playlist has thousands of songs.\nSince upgrading to iTunes 12.2, I'm seeing some ratings with black stars, and others with gray stars.  Apparently, the gray star ratings are automatically generated by iTunes.  I've never seen this before.  To make matters worse, songs with zero ratings are showing up in my smart playlists because iTunes assigned them a gray rating.\nHow do I get rid of the automatically generated gray ratings?  How do I prevent iTunes from ever automatically generating false ratings again?\nI've got over 30,000 songs.  I don't want iTunes destroying my ratings system with false ratings!  Just because I like one song on an album doesn't mean the whole album is great.\nAdditional info: I'm not using iTunes Match (my library exceeds the 25,000 songs limit).  I did check \"iCloud Music Library\" yesterday while signing up for Apple Music, but I've also tried turning that off and it doesn't get rid of the gray/guess/false ratings.\n\nA: This is a bug introduced in iTunes 12.2 at the end of June.  It appears that iTunes has done some sort of averaging of track ratings and written them as album ratings overwriting the original per-track ratings.\nI've seen this issue with my library of approximately 100,000 tracks and have filed a bug report with Apple in Radar. Removing the album rating data is difficult as iTunes won't reliably show this data in smart playlists and many of the utilities that try to do mass change operations fail when setting this attribute.\nThe tool I've been using to slowly clean it up is Doug Adam's \"Album Rating Reset.\"  This only works on one album at a time, but if you really care about your ratings, you're going to want to clean this up very carefully to avoid damaging any of your remaining per-track ratings.\nI should add that I was also able to restore a number of the lost per-track items by restoring a pre-iTunes 12.2 library to a separate user account , confirmed that the ratings will still present and then used the commercial SuperSync utility to transfer the ratings from the old library to my latest 12.2.2 library using the metadata transfer tool.\nWhat a hassel!

That's what bugs us in the workplace when something doesn't work\".\nWell, I did it. And it worked. System's firewall seems to block afsd. Disabling the firewall solved the issue.\nOh by the way, that's my girl.\n\nA: The firewall issue is one I chased deep into the kernel to debug; The source for the application firewall's socketfw kext is not available, but it will, on some loads of the AFS3-protocol providing kext, for some (but not all) peer endpoints, return spurious EPERM errors. If you disable the firewall, the issue goes away. if you re-enable the firewall the issue does not come back.\n", "Q: iPad: app stops when screen is locked Basically I have a problem with apps stopping when the screen is locked. I have first encountered this issue when I started using Strava. \nI would normally start recording on Strava, lock the screen and put the iPad into my backpack, after I finish the ride, I would unlock the screen just to find out that the app is not running.\nI initially though that this is Strava specific issue, but I have since tried Endomondo and it exhibits exactly the same behavior.\nFew details:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I start the recording, then lock the screen, then unlock it within the short period of time (~ 1 minute or less) - the app is still running. Which means it does not stop immediately after the screen lock\n\n*If I don't lock the screen, but just put the iPad into my backpack, the screen locks automatically in 5 minutes. In this case, no matter how long I ride, the app will keep running and will be still active when I unlock the screen. This is a workaround but not prefered solution\n\n\nI would like to know why does iPad stop apps after the screen lock and how do I change that behavior.\nI am using iPad mini and iOS 8.2\nUPDATE:\nbased on the comments and answers from other users, few more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Location Services are enabled for these apps and set to \"Always on\"\n\n*Background refresh is enabled in the system and for these apps\n\n\nA: The worst, but working solution will be to set screen locking to 30 seconds, so that it will go to sleep faster. Looks like apple does it on purpose.\n\nA: Maybe Background App Refresh is deactivated?\nGo to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and check if a specific app is blocked, or if the general switch is off.\n\n\nA: Maybe Location Services are set to \"While Using\" for those apps?\nGo to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and look for Strava.\n\nIn my settings is set to \"Always\"\n\n", "Q: Beats One turns off Airplay?

That key works, but when the shift key is depressed it doesn't output anything.\nIt doesn't appear to be a software issue, as it's exactly the same on both my imac and when hooked up to my macbook.\nGhost in the machine?\n\nA: Given the problem appears on two Macs, this suggests a hardware fault. If the keyboard is not too old, take it to an Apple Store. They may be able to replace it for you.\nThe strange behaviour you are seeing could be because a circuit is damaged and causing ghosting. Microsoft's article on ghosting explains more:\n\nWhat causes ghosting?\nTypically, ghosting is the result of one or more of following three limitations: the hardware can't read the given key combination, the software on the computer doesn't support multiple simultaneous keys, or the communication protocol between the hardware and software limits the maximum number of simultaneous keys reported. The next section discusses in more detail the hardware design of typical keyboards that limits the number of keys that can be read at the same time.\n\n", "Q: What are the effective scaling modes on OSX with a 4K display? Is an effective real estate of 2560x1440 possible? I have a 2015 retina macbook pro, the default scaled resolution of 1920x1080 would be too small for me. I currently have a 2560x1440 display and couldn't accept less real estate.\nUnder the display settings, if you select \"scaled\" you should be able to choose between \"larger text\" or \"more space\". If I understand correctly, all of these options should use 3840x2160 pixels to render the output (ie, the monitor wont know the difference). The default scaling option should be the equivalent of 1920x1080. I was wondering if you choose \"more space\" it would allow for the equivalent of 2560x1440 (but scaled so should look crisper than a 2560x1440 display).\n\nAs a bonus question, would this be comfortable on a 24\" display (eg, Dell P2415Q)\n\nA: Note that if you Alt+click the \"Scaled\" resolution radio in the display preferences you will see many more resolution options than the default 5 (source: Apple support article \"Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac\").\nThe options depend on the maximum resolution of your monitor and possibly your Mac graphic card/Mac generation etc.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) + LG 27 inch 4K monitor\n\nFull list:\n\n*\n\n*3840 x 2160 (4K)\n\n*3360 x 1890\n\n*3200 x 1800\n\n*3008 x 1692\n\n*2560 x 1440\n\n*2304 x 1296\n\n*2048 x 1152\n\n*1920 x 1080 (Full HD)\n\n*1680 x 945\n\n*1600 x 900\n\n*1503 x 846\n\n*1280 x 720\n\n*1152 x 648\n\nMacbook Air (M1, 2020) + SAMSUNG 28 inch 4K monitor\n(Full monitor model: U28R550UQRXEN)\n\nFull list, including \"low resolution\" modes:\n\n*\n\n*3840 x 2160 (4K)\n\n*3008 x 1692\n\n*3008 x 1692 (low resolution)\n\n*2560 x 1440\n\n*2560 x 1440 (low resolution)\n\n*2304 x 1296\n\n*2304 x 1296 (low resolution)\n\n*2048 x 1152\n\n*2048 x 1152 (low resolution)\n\n*1920 x 1080 (Full HD)\n\n*1920 x 1080 (Full HD) (low resolution)\n\n*1680 x 945\n\n*1600 x 900\n\n*1600 x 900 (low resolution)\n\n*1504 x 846*\n\n*1280 x 720\n\n*1280 x 720 (low resolution)\n\n*1152 x 648\n\n* - yes, it is 1504 vertical while above this resolution had 1503 vertical ‍♂️\n\nAnd to answer your bonus question:\nI am guessing that you use 2560x1440 on a 27-inch display now.\nIf so then to be comfortable you should get also 27-inch 4K monitor and use scaled resolution from the list above that will \"look like\" 2560x1440.\nYou will get the same screen real estate and the same size of everything, just sharper.\nHowever, performance will be noticeably worse, in form of a delay after you type something and before it appears on the screen. Of course it will be in the range of milliseconds, but you will notice it.\nUpdate: The delay I wrote about above was noticeable on the MacBook I had then (2015 Pro 15 inch without a dedicated GPU).

Is there a way to fix this?\nThanks,\nAmit\n\nA: Seems like it depends on how many songs/albums you have for each artist. Some artists that I have only a few songs from have the same old style. If I have like every song from every album, then I have your problem. I think it just depends on the amount of songs you have.\n\nA: Yes, it depends on how many albums you have.\nIf you have a lot of albums from an artist with only a couple of songs on each album, it's a truly awful piece of UX design.\n\nA: Personally I prefer it like this as this is how it used to be... I was a bit confused to why it was only doing it with some and not others but now I understand having it not bunch them up if I only have two or less albums is a lot more bearable than if for example, I have ten albums of some artists and have to go through every single song to get to one album.

I read this can be achieved using AppleScript but I wish to stay in bash if possible.\nFurther more, presenting a progress bar of the transcoding would be just awesome.\nThis is how my Automator action looks like:\n\n\nA: To get your shell (bash) script to output to the screen continually so that you can see the progress, you need to launch it from AppleScript.  Basically, this is a script that is launching another script.  Use the script below to kick of the script that contains your ffmpeg command.  You can even pass arguments to your script as you would normally.\nFor this example, I have a simple bash script that prints out the first command line argument.\n#! /bin/bash\n# test.sh\necho $1\nexit\n\nNext, is the AppleScript code that kicks off the bash script\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n   do script \"<path>/test.sh 'Hello World'; exit\"\n   activate\nend tell\n\nNote, that if you have any strings with spaces that you need to pass, they MUST be enclosed in single quotes.

Without losing folders. One might have a subfolder inside a subfolder with 35 files, the other with 12 files - yet the 12 files wouldn't be in the 35 files, so I'd have to be able to merge subfolders so that I don't lose any files.

It was a feature that I was using passively, but now I can't find it and I'm having quite hard time jumping to song's album, which I did a lot.\n\nA: *\n\n*The currently playing song shows up in a horizontal now playing bar.\n\n\n*Click the three dots on the right hand side of the bar.\n\n\n*Click on the album name at the top of the pop up menu.\n\n\nA: There is a bug \"Unknown Album\" if you do that on an Apple Music track. \n", "Q: How do I find and use the filename on photos in Photos.app? I live by my photo filenames but they are gone in now that there is the new (crappy) Photos. Thankfully on one computer I did not do the update so I still have iPhoto.\nCertainly I'm missing something silly and the filenames are still there but I can't locate them in Photos. I appreciate any help. \n\nA: You can still see the original file name of a photo in the information panel, opened using cmd ⌘ I. It's right there under the photo's title.\nIt seems you cannot search for file names in the Photos.app search. What still works is creating a smart album (⌥ alt cmd ⌘ N) to search for a specific file name or a pattern. See for example this Macworld article.\nThe Photos app really hides the actual file names quite well. In the finder, you cannot even search for them using Spotlight unless you first open the package content of your Photos library and directly search in that Finder window.\n\nA: If you mean the Photograph Titles, that can be toggled by  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   T \nor you can find it in View > Metadata > Titles\n\nA: And if you are not talking about Titles but the camera assigned file name, then you are out of luck.\nThe migration from iPhoto to Photo does not migrate the actual file name.\nThere is a chance to see the file name in the \"Moments\" view.\n", "Q: I'm having gaming problems I have a game on my phone that I want to restart and play from the beginning.

As such, I have 6 desktops ready to go at any given time.\nI have the \"Auto-Arrange\" option switched off, so I don't lose my mind going through the desktops.\nMy problem lies in switching an app into full screen. The default behavior of course is for the space to go to the far right of all the desktops, and in cases where I'm only using 2 or 3 desktops, I end up having to swipe into mission control and either manually rearranging for every app I switch into full-screen, or when I'm in \"auto-mode\", I just end up swiping 4 times or so to get to the space...\nAny behavior can be changed, just a matter of finding a way.\nAnyone know how to change it so that full-screen apps show up on the left of the other desktops/spaces (same as where the dashboard is), instead of being added to the right of them?\n\nA: I've never found any way to get full-screen apps to go to the left. At least they don't drop randomly in the middle of other Desktops like they used to, so at least you now know where they're going to be.\nMy workaround has been to use the default ctrl/number key commands in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control, as below, which in my case makes the first full-screen app accessible by  Ctrl ⌃   6  then  Ctrl ⌃   →  or one swipe.\n\n", "Q: How do I force Spotlight to index new folders? When I create new Dropbox folders, Spotlight does not see them. When does Spotlight index new folders? Or better yet, can I force Spotlight to index new folders?\n\nA: From Apple Support: How to rebuild the Spotlight index on your Mac\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu () > System Preferences, then click Spotlight.\n  \n*Click the Privacy tab.\n  \n*Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.\n  To add an item to the Privacy tab, you must have ownership permissions for that item. To learn about permissions, choose Help from the Finder menu bar, then search for “permissions.”\n  \n*From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.\n  \n*Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n  \n\nNote: Apple Support Document Update: Published Date: Nov 14, 2016 See edit history of this answer to see a previous version of this information.\n\nNote: Dropbox specific information as an addendum to the Apple Support directions.\nThe above directions are the written ones from Apple Support however with an object like Dropbox on the Sidebar in Finder do not drag and drop it from there, instead either add it to the Privacy tab using the plus (\"+\") button or drag and drop it from your Home folder.  Then remove it using the minus (\"-\") button.\nIf Dropbox was removed from the Sidebar in it can be dragged back from one's Home folder.\n\nA: There are two ways to force indexing on a folder/directory:\nmdimport\nIf the directory is new and has not been indexed before (or even if it resides within a directory structure that has previously been excluded from indexing), mdimport is your tool of choice:\nFrom a terminal window, type mdimport /path/to/directory to get indexing started. Possible error messages related to missing or outdated importers for file types found within that path will splatter into your view.\nmdutil\nTo force re-indexing on a previously indexed folder, run mdutil -E on it as root user. If indexing for a higher level folder (or the entire volue) has been switched of by the user, mdutil will complain (unknown indexing state in a subfolder, or Indexing and searching disabled. at the node where the block starts) and refuse indexing. In that case activate indexing for the subtree desired from a user perspective with mdimport as described above.\n\nA: I was also having trouble with indexing when I installed Dropbox. Here is what I recommend.\n\n*\n\n*Don't use Spotlight for file/folder searches. Use Alfred.\n\n\n*Install Alfred. Go to Alfred Preferences. Go to Features --> Default Results. In Search Scope, add the folders you want to be indexed.\n\n\n*Then within Alfred Preferences, go to Advanced -> File/Apps -> Rebuild macOS Metadata --> Delete .Spotlight-V100 Folder and then proceed with the steps that are presented. This YouTube video guides the user through all this.\nIf you don't find some of the above options, you may need to purchase the Powerpack feature of Alfred from here. After all this, your indexed files should start showing up in Alfred and Spotlight searches.\n", "Q: Cannot open games or video on ipad I updated some games on my ipad mini, in addition to downloading several new ones.

Even if there was a way to password protect so that data could not be used unless a password is entered would help. There already is a password for the phone.  But the kids know it and use data.

When I put my iMac to sleep, the screen goes dark, but after about 10 seconds, the red LED on the bottom of the mouse flashes rapidly for about 5 seconds, then the LED turns solid for about 2 seconds, and then the iMac wakes up.\nAn entry in the syslog confirms that the Macally mouse is issuing a \"remote wakeup\" signal:\n\nJul  1 21:51:55 imac kernel[0] : Wake reason: EHC2\nJul  1 21:51:55 imac kernel[0] : The USB device HubDevice (Port 1 of Hub at 0xfa000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (2)\nJul  1 21:51:55 imac kernel[0] : AppleThunderboltHAL::earlyWake - complete - took 0 milliseconds\nJul  1 21:51:55 imac kernel[0] : 169.011637: ar9300WowWakeUp: Skip PCIE WA programming\nJul  1 21:51:55 iMac kernel[0] : The USB device Macally BUMPERMOUSE (Port 3 of Hub at 0xfa100000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (3)\nJul  1 21:51:55 iMac kernel[0] : full wake (reason 1) 72 ms\n\nI sent an email to Macally Tech Support but I'm not holding my breath....\nIs there a setting (or script?) to tell OSX to ignore remote wakeup signal from a USB mouse?\nThanks.\n\nA: No. You'll need to unplug USB devices that wake your Mac prematurely. \nThis is a firmware level task which would require significant training to pull off. Nothing is impossible, but this isn't an easy setting to simply change. \nHopefully the vendor has a way to make it more like other USB mice that only wake their host when they are physically moved and not for the fun of it. \n", "Q: Terminal Command Line to find corrupted files I do have just one corrupted photo into my Photos Library.\nIs there is any UNIX command line that I can use in terminal in order to scan my Photos Library Folder and find out which file is corrupted?\n\nA: My first thought was that ImageMagick is bound to have something for this, and indeed it does. You could run something like this\nfind . -name \"*.JPG\" -exec identify {} \\; | grep Corrupt\n\nwhere you can replace . with your directory of choice (it will descend recursively) to check each file or image with ImageMagick's identify command. Grepping for 'Corrupt' will print you identifys output for those files which are in fact corrupt. You could probably trim the output to make it more readable, which would involve some regexing for grep.\nObviously, you need to have ImageMagick installed for this. If you use MacPorts, it's as simple as sudo port install ImageMagick.\n", "Q: Open iMovie with alt down from AppleScript How to open iMovie with alt from keyboard with AppleScript?\n\nA: Here is a script by maeks84 which does the same for iPhoto that might help you with accomplishing the same for iMovie (need to post as answer due to the length).\nCode inserted in case it ever goes down..\n--maeks84@gmail.com\n--http://maeks84.wordpress.com\n\nproperty libraryPath : \"Macintosh HD:Users:Path:to:iPhoto Library\"\n\n--Determine if iPhoto is open and needs to be quit\n--Will only bring iPhoto to the front if the correct library is already open\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if exists process \"iPhoto\" then --Only worries about the current user\n        tell application \"iPhoto\"\n            if image path of photo 1 does not contain POSIX path of libraryPath then\n                activate\n                beep\n                display dialog \"About to quit iPhoto!\" giving up after 300 --Gives a chance to cancel otherwise continues on\n                quit\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    repeat while exists process \"iPhoto\"\n                        delay 3\n                    end repeat\n                end tell\n                my launch_library()\n            else\n                activate\n            end if\n        end tell\n    else --iPhoto is not currently running\n        my launch_library()\n    end if\nend tell\n\non launch_library()\n    do shell script \"defaults write com.apple.iPhoto RootDirectory \" & quoted form of POSIX path of libraryPath\n    tell application \"iPhoto\" to activate\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        repeat while (exists process \"iPhoto\") is false --Delay until iPhoto is launched\n            delay 5\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    do shell script \"defaults remove com.apple.iPhoto RootDirectory\" --Restore the default library\nend launch_library\n\n\nA: --here's an applescript to copy/paste that might work (unless I misunderstood the question...)\ndisplay dialog \"would you like to open imovie?\"\ntell application \"finder\"\nopen \"imovie\"\nend tell\n--p.s.

However, when I run iTunes it's still version 12.1.\nThe update will appear again in the App Store update window eventually, but the outcome is always the same. I now have seven updates to iTunes 12.2 showing in the App Store, none of which has actually worked.\nI tried downloading the installer from the Apple website, which gets right to the end of the install process before giving this error message:\n\nI also tried removing my existing iTunes installation via the Terminal.

I have an Apple Music subscription and iTunes 12.2 on an HTPC (Windows) which his my primary music player. I want to use my iPhone to control what I play. I've tried the Apple Remote app, which works, but it only allows me to choose music that I've added to my library. It does not allow me to look up an arbitrary song from the cloud (whatever the term for this is - it's the functionality under the \"New\" section of iTunes on OSX) and play it from the Remote. If I want to do that I have to do it directly on HTPC, which is not acceptable.\nBasically I just want Spotify Connect functionality for Apple Music. If it's from the Remote app, great. If it's from the Music app, great. What has been the most successful approach from others with a similar need?\n\nA: In 2022 - Siri and Apple Watch and AirPods and HomePod are now the primary players for me. I can and will use my Mac and iPad and iPhone for some tasks, but once I have my playlists, I can ask for songs or artists or playlists and no longer need an iPhone to direct the music. My how things have changed in a few short years.\nI don’t think you can merge Spotify and Apple music in an effective manner, so you might have to choose your champion.\n\nIn 2018 - AirPlay and AirPlay 2 are the premier ways to play Apple Music. Most people will want to just connect their speakers to a computer or device and use Siri / AirPlay to queue up music.\nIf we go in a time machine back to 2015 - the situation was a little less clear, but using iPhone and Apple TV was still the best way to stream music over WiFi from many controllers.\n\n(much of what follows is wrong and/or outdated, but were possible solutions at a past point in time)\nYour iPhone is a first tier player in Apple Music. It would be better to just play the music on your phone rather than monkey with \"remote\". Send the music over the network to the PC rather than sending the remote commands over the network to the PC.\nRemote options are:\n\n*\n\n*Wait for Apple's remote to get updated for the hot newness\n\n*Get a VNC/RDC remote and control the PC (janky - but does 100% what the PC can do without needing anything else on the PC end) screen directly.\n\n*Third party remotes like Rowmote Pro (I say like since I have a handful of iPhone to Mac remotes - just can't recommend specific PC ones)\n\nThe iPhone can AirPlay to a PC quite easily with software on the PC such as AirFoil for Windows and you're set with Apple's full fledged iOS music controls but taking advantage of the PC to speaker connection you have already set up.\nDepending on how the PC outputs to speakers, you could also add hardware ($5 to $65) to get the sound from either the PC or the iOS devices to the speakers. You don't need to do that as there are several workable software solutions.\n\nA: Not much of a solution, but it's worth noting that the last update to the Remote app (4.2.2) was released on May 21st, before the announcement of Apple Music. It wouldn't surprise me that a future update would address this unacceptable issue.\n\nIf it does not, I would immediately destroy my iPhone and buy a Zune.\n\nA: iTunes allows you to send Audio/Music from the new Music service to multiple Air Play speakers.  The Music App on the phone only allows one speaker.  Without using a third party product like Airfoil or third party remote on a iDevice there is no way to control the Music service via iTunes natively within the Apple ecosystem. This is limiting for people that have set up iTunes at the heart of their multi speaker audio system.  iPhone only act as remotes in my house, never the source. \nHopefully they will update remote quickly to give us this ability.  It's the first thing I tried to do with the new service, and it is holding me back from using it more.\n\nA: No. A feature equivalent to Spotify Connect is currently not available for Apple Music.\nFor other remote options currently avaiable, see bmike's answer.\n\nA: I have Itunes 12.2.0. I can play a radio station on Apple Music Radio and using the remote app by Apple, I can control my mac's iTunes playing Apple Music.

I have iTunes 12.2 installed, I can see Beats 1 in my iTunes app, I can even stream Beats 1 by manually opening its URL in iTunes. So why won't iTunes just let me listen to Beats 1 on Mountain Lion? As far as I can tell, there are zero technical reasons for why I'm having this problem. Anyone?\n\nA: Due to the fact that Apple provides upgrades and fresh installations of their operating systems for free, they would (in most cases) only provide support for the latest operating system and (in many cases) the one before it (in today's case (as of the time of this answer), OS X Yosemite and OS X Mavericks respectfully). If there is something wrong with iTunes, Apple would usually recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of OS X.\nIn your case, iTunes requires OS X 10.7.5 (Lion) or later, but Apple Music requires OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks) or later (source: http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/; under \"Software\"; look at the screenshot below) also, look at the ), so chances are it will not work unless you upgrade to at least OS X Mavericks.\n\n", "Q: Where iTunes stores my playlists and ratings I am wondering where iTunes keeps all my playlists?

Do I need to do something to backup them?\nAnd the similar question about ratings. Where they are stored and how can I keep them between iTunes and Mac OS reinstallation?\n\nA: Actually it stores the original on your computer.\nThe iCloud just gets a copy of it if you have set it up that way.\nYou can find the file in the ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl\nand in the iTunes Music Library.xml (located in same place)\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201610\n", "Q: Application not running, but dock thinks it is, so i can't quit/open it This has happened to multiple applications so far, i'm not sure what causes it, but it seems to happen after force quitting (sometimes).\nFirst, you force quit it, and it does, but the dock shows that it is still open, but not responding.

If you drag the file location into terminal, it still does not work.

When hard drive space runs out, older file backups are discarded.\nTo perform a restore, one can perform a full system restore, which returns the entirety of your Mac file system contents to the latest files and structure that had been backed up.\nAlternatively, you can browse through the progressive backups using a Finder-like interface, and choose specific files or folders to restore.\nFor more in-depth descriptions, it is worthwhile to read Pondini's repository of Time Machine information.\n", "Q: OS X Calendar extremely slow My calendar app has become super slow (possibly after the OS X 10.10.4 upgrade). Every action, like clicking on a calendar item or scrolling to the next week, will result in approximately 60 seconds of OS X beachballing. The app syncs with 8 different calendar servers (webdav, google, exchange, and ical). This usually works very well.\nI had this issue some years ago but forgot how to fix it. Any ideas?\n\nA: The first step is to make a new user account. \n\n\n*\n\n*Does calendar app itself contain the problem with no calendar data?\n\n\nThen you can isolate things from the network. Pull any wired networks and power down WiFi and restart. Retest calendar in the test account (which presumably is always fast and responsive) and your account (which is slow now).\nOnce you've done that, you can enable networking, sign out of your account and add your calendar source data one by one (if you maintain several calendars in OS X) to the test account to tell if your data is slowing the app.\nAssuming you have a speedy calendar in the test account with your real calendar data - you can conclude that your caches for the data was the cause of the slowness. When that happens, I usually move everything over to a new account since the corruption in one app is almost always shared in another.\nTo make sure the disk isn't causing further issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the calendar data from the test account\n\n*make a full backup (if you like) as well as a Time Machine backup\n\n*restart the Mac to recovery HD to repair the volume with Disk Utility (or do a safe boot which runs the same filesystem check)\n\n*use the test account to remove the old account - keeping the files on disk (don't erase and don't make an image of the home folder when asked)\n\n*make the normal user account and then use that to move back the data from the old home folder\n\n\nA: I solved my slow calendar by turning off Birthday calendars, Holiday Calendar, and Siri Found in Apps Calendar in the Calendar preferences.\nI noticed an immediate improvement in speed. I restarted Calendar and the speed improved even more.\nI suspect the slowness came from the birthday calendar feature. I have 5,787 contacts and that causes slowness elsewhere. I noticed Calendar app RAM usage went from about 300MB to about 100MB after turning off the special calendars.\n\n", "Q: Stop prompting to unlock disk I have two hard disks on my 2012 Mac Mini. The first disk is partitioned with Mac HD and Data HD. The second drive has OS X Public Beta and Windows partitioned.\nI want to prevent OS X on my main disk from auto-mounting OS X Public Beta and Windows 7. Both are encrypted (FileVault 2 and Bitlocker).\nI tried to edit /etc/fstab and /private/etc/fstab which seem to be replicated but it doesn't work. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I added a line for Data HD which is not encrypted and it didn't mount.\nsudo vifs\nUUID=NUMBER none hfs ro,noauto\nThat's the line I'm issuing for Public Beta. I'm assuming its not hfs because of FV2 so is there another file system I need to enter? I also tried hfs+ and it didn't work, I still get prompted to enter passcode.\nFor Windows 7, I'm assuming I would use ntfs? I'm not using BootCamp so I don't think it would be fat.\n\nA: Instead of using UUID try using LABEL. This will help to rule out UUID problems.\nThe following line in /private/etc/fstab stops the drive named SpareSSHD from mounting on OS X 10.10:\nLABEL=SpareSSHD none    hfs rw,noauto\n\nMy drives are encrypted with FileVault2 and this works.\nThe following links provide more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I tell OSX NOT to mount some of the drives in my computer?\n\n*fstab(5) manual\n/private/etc/fstab and /etc/fstab are the same file. As @forquare confirms, they are symlinked. You can edit either.\n\nA: Try 'xx' instead of rw or ro. Since a FV2 drive doesn't mount until you unlock it, the rw,ro won't do anything. \n", "Q: After upgrading iTunes all my media has disappeared I have just upgraded to iTunes 12.2 on OSX Yosemite.

I'm kind of OCD and like to know what data is behind every recommendation system.\nIs there a way to view all the loved (hearted) items (songs, playlists, etc.) in Apple Music?\nI believe at worst case scenario one could just reset them.\n\nA: If you are listening in iTunes you can make a smart playlist which automatically adds all loved songs to it.\n\nNote that this playlist will only contain songs that you \"loved\" on each respective device. I.e. if you love a song on your iPhone it will not appear in your \"loved songs\" smart playlist on your mac, or vice versa.

This morning it was still working on something (the black off screen with the loading bar and apple), and then it asked for my passwords, my touch id, my iTunes account etc. \nI entered the passwords etc., it got accepted and then I left my house (therefore my Wi-Fi). 10 minutes later I receive notifications that I've used 900MB of data and I owe £19 for overspending. \nHow is this possible? Isn't it supposed to only update when connected to Wi-Fi or with my specific permission? I have no idea how to spend 900MB in 10 minutes. Please give me an official message from Apple saying that it will not update unless on Wi-Fi, or specifically approved.\n\nA: I do not know if I had this problem because I have unlimited data, but my friend did. Notably, she also has a different carrier (Verizon) with limited data and when she noticed the high data usage she contacted Apple. They acknowledged that with some carriers this is a bug in the newest version of the iOS. The fix they had her implement, until the next version of the iOS comes out, was to revert to the prior version. Since the update had completed, she was forced to do this through a full reset. Since the phone came with an earlier iOS version, this is what it reverted back to and the issue was solved. Again, I am only reporting this as an observer and have not fixed/experienced personally, but thought I would offer this in the event it helps. \n", "Q: How to resolve: files which are visible in Terminal, but invisible in the Finder?

Skype in Application Support and com.skype.plist are not invisible by default. Try changing the ~/Library/Application Support with /Users/<username>/Library/ Application Support, with  being your Username without the <>. \nI find it easy to \"Go to\" with Shift+Command+G while there is Finder selected, and in the path type /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/ and click Go.

I have a default installation of nano under /usr/bin/, and I am trying to make nano highlight the bash scripting language code.\nI have been searching around, but I had no success: I got always some errors, or simply doesn't work. For example, I have tried to download the following repository from Github github.com/nanorc/nanorc.git with the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/nanorc/nanorc.git\n\nand then follow the steps in this post, but I have had errors because some command inside the files are not recognised. In particular, if I add this line include ~/nanorc/shell.nanorc to my file ~/.nanorc, where the file shell.nanorccontains:\nsyntax \"sh\" \"\\.sh$\" \"\\.bash$\" \"bashrc$\" \"bash_profile$\"\nheader \"^#!.*/(env +)?(ba|k|pdk)?sh[-0-9_]*( |$)\"\n\nFUNCTION: \"^[A-Za-z0-9_+-]+[[:space:]]*\\(\\)\"\nKEYWORD:  \"\\<(case|do|done|elif|else|esac|fi|for|function|if)\\>\"\nKEYWORD:  \"\\<(in|select|then|time|until|while)\\>\"\nFUNCTION: \"\\<(echo|exit|export|let|local|read|return|set|shift|umask|unset)\\>\"\nFUNCTION: \"\\<(source)\\>\"\nOPERATOR: \"[{}()<>!=&|;`$]|\\\\|\\[|\\]|-(eq|ne|gt|lt|ge|le|s|n|z)\\>\"\nSTRING:   \"\"(\\\\.|[^\"])*\"\"\nVARIABLE: \"\\$\\{?[A-Za-z0-9_!@#$*?-]+\\}?|`[^`]*`\"\nSTRING:   \"'(\\\\.|[^'])*'\"\nESCAPE:   \"\\\\.?\"\n+HASHCOMMENT\n+TODO\n+LINT\n\nIt seems that these previous commands, such STRING, ESCAPE, etc, are not recognised.\nHow would you set syntax highlighting for nano, at least for bash?\n\nA: Install the latest version of nano with homebrew:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/\n\n*Install nano: brew install nano\n\n*Add this line to ~/.nanorc. That directory has all the syntax highlighting definition files.\ninclude \"/usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc\"\n\n\nA: From the Nanorc(5) man file:\n\nThe configuration file accepts a series of set and unset commands, which  can be used  to  configure  nano on startup without using the command line options.  Additionally, the syntax, color, and icolor keywords are used to  define  syntax  highlighting rules for different text patterns.  nano will read one command per line.\n\nYour nanorc lacks that.\nFrom the git read me from that repo:\n\nWhy do I get weird errors when running nano < 2.1.5 on *BSD systems?\n  In order to reliably highlight keywords, this projects makes heavy use of the GNU regex word boundary extensions (\\< and >). BSD implementations also have these extensions but use a different, incompatible syntax ([[:<:]] and [[:>:]]). Since version 2.1.5, nano can automatically translate the GNU syntax to BSD syntax at run-time, but for the benefit of people running a pre-2.1.5 version of nano on OS X or *BSD, the .nanorc file itself can be translated by installing with make BSDREGEX=1.\n\nWhat is happening is that you did not actually follow the full install commands. If you cloned the git, cd'd into the directory, and ran make install, your syntax files would look different. For one, the default version of nano on OS X (I'm on 10.10.5 Mavericks) is nano 2.0.6. It does not support the header in syntax in this older version. The makefile for the git repo would remove that. And it would add in the color options.\nYou have 3 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you have the OS X command line tools (or full X Code)\ninstalled and run all of the install commands.\n\n*use precompiled nanorc syntax files compatible with the preinstalled nano 2.0.6 with BSD regex.\n\n*Install a newer nano, and use the nanorc that come with the full install.\n\n\nAs a bonus, I found and edited a single nanorc for sh/bash.

So,\nI have an iPad Air 2 64 GB LTE purchased in India. I'm using a network carrier called Airtel for the data. This device is running iOS 8.4 as of posting this question.\nHere's my problem-\nWhen I put in my SIM card, the 3G band doesn't work. I don't see an option to manually select a 3G band either. I can see LTE or 2G/Edge but not 3G. \nSome of you may ask - Why not just use LTE? Because Airtel only allows LTE for users of post-paid phones. I don't want to use a post paid connection for a device which is seldom out of WiFi range. For the few occasions that I'm not near Wifi, I need the iPad to work with whatever sim card I have with me. Also, LTE coverage is spotty to poor in most Indian cities. \nFor readers from other countries - specifically from the US, cell phones and tablets are purchased directly from something like a Best Buy after paying full price. These devices are carrier unlocked. It is the norm to swap in whichever SIM card suits your fancy for that day. The expectation from the device is that it should work perfectly.\nOn Android/Windows Phone/Symbian/Blackberry devices, its a trivial matter to go to the device settings and have the device use a specific network band. This is useful when you have poor 4g/3g coverage and want the device to stick to lets say, 2G/Edge bands. A 2G/Edge band is still quite useful for IM, Emails, SMS and phone calls. Obviously, you can't use it for streaming media, but that's alright.\nRecent iOS devices have the hardware capable of using the most popular 2G/3G/4G/LTE/WCDMA bands. However, for reasons best decided by the iOS engineers, the choice to allow this band selection is enabled by the network carrier through the use of some elusive settings and files called the IPCC or Carrier settings files.\nFor readers from developed countries - most networks in India don't bother providing IPCC files because all non-iOS devices work without these settings just fine. So, when I go to an Apple forum - I'm just asked to use a different network. (As if!)\nAnyway, I've searched the Internet high and low for these mystical IPCC files. Most resources are out of date or suggest that you root the device. Rooting is not an option because that would void the warranty.\nEvery time I connect the iPad to iTunes, I see a popup saying that carrier updates are available...I tell it to go do the update, but then zilch.. nothing happens.\nThen I go do the other thing all Internet resources tell me : Settings > General > About > Update... and again, zilch.\nSo, how do I go about solving this problem? \nThanks for any help.\nps: Any comment or suggestion which mentions that the network carrier should provide these files - I say to them : All other devices work perfectly on their networks, so why should there be special arrangements for an iOS device? In developing countries, iOS devices account for a minor fraction of the subscriber base.\n\nA: I found the answer myself and I thought I should put it out there for another hapless (recent iOS) convert drawn like a moth to the flame that is these beautiful yet quite flawed iOS devices, so that they may continue make the most of their devices in good network coverage or poor.\nSo, how do you get an iPad Air 2 LTE (running iOS 8.x) to the ability to use 3G on Airtel India in Bangalore, Karnataka?\nWithout much further ado, I present to you the answer .... \n... do a factory restore using an IPSW file.\nIts really simple to do this. I'll give you the general outline.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iPad or iPhone using iTunes or iCloud. You should already know how to do this.\n\n*Download the IPSW file for your device onto your computer. This link is a good place to start. There are other websites which provide the same service.\n\n*Connect your iOS device to iTunes and select restore device. This link has more details.\n\n*Keep your device connected to the computer throughout the restore process.\n\n*When the device has booted up after the reset, iTunes will ask you to check for the carrier settings check. Allow it do so... and you will have 3G working on your iOS device.\nI hope this helps someone else.\n", "Q: Modify Trackpad Right click via command line without logout Is it possible to toggle the the preference setting under Trackpad labeled Secondary Click without logging out and in, so that I can toggle two-finger right-click for the builtin trackpad?\nI found the command\ndefaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true\nBut that doesn't seem to work. Toggling the checkbox does also seem to change ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist when system preferences is closed, but using defaults to change that doesn't help either. \nI'd like to toggle it multiple times in one session without going through system preferences, so logging out and back in isn't preferable.\n\nA: I think you would need to reload the kext for it\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTrackpad.kext to disable it. \nChange kextunload to kextload to re-enable it.\nNow create a script from above so you can run it with one click.\nSorry, that was for the external trackpad.\nFor the internal that would be to unload:\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBMultitouch; sudo touch /system/library/extensions ; exit\n\n", "Q: apps crash on iphone4 I have an iphone4 running the up-to-date version: 7.1.2 since the IOs software is no longer updated for an iphone4. Recently many apps simply crash: such as \n\n\n*\n\n*chrome\n\n*google maps\n\n*shazam\n\n*IMDB\n\n\nI assume that the app version is too high for my iphone4. If this is so, then why do such apps update automatically without first testing whether the hardware can support the newest app version? Are there ways I can stop this in the future?  Finally, can one downgrade the app version to something that works?\n\nA: Its supposed that the apps that you can download should work well on your iphone, in the case where the app is not compatible with that iOS version it should pop you an alert, if some app does not work correctly the only thing you can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*What you are doing right now, restore the device and manage well your iphone storage.\n\n*Post an App Store review in which you describe yout problem..\nThis type of issues are not supposed to happen, especially with big developers like Google but..who knows.\n", "Q: 7th gen iPod radio with a bluetooth headset in motorcycle helmet I have just bought a 7th generation iPod and I have a bluetooth headset in a motorcycle helmet. Is there any way to listen to the radio through bluetooth given that the headphones are the antenna?\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about an iPod nano.\n\niPod nano uses the headphone cord as an antenna, so you must connect headphones to iPod nano to receive a radio signal. For better reception, make sure the cord isn’t tangled or coiled.\n  FM radio will not play through a Bluetooth accessory.\n\nSource: Apple support document\n", "Q: Coupon Printer locked up my computer I attempted to download a coupon to save a few dollars and now my computer is locked up.  Box says...\"your computer can't be shut down now because software is being installed. Keynote is being installed.  Interrupting the install may damage your computer.  you can shut down when install is complete.\"  This is a half hour later.\n\nA: Don't worry about damaging your computer.  OS X (and Windows now) can't be damaged if you shut down in the middle of software installation.  OS installation maybe, but not software.\nGo ahead and hit that power button.\nIf you try to print a webpage and it starts to install software, then it may be a piece of malware.\nTry taking a screen shot and print that out.\nHere are some sample commands to get a capture of your screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command+Shift+3: takes a screenshot of the full screen or screens if\nmultiple monitors), and save it as a file to the desktop\n\n*Command+Shift+4: brings up a selection box so you can specify an area\nto take a screenshot of, then save it as a file to the desktop\n\n*Command+Shift+4, then spacebar, then click a window: takes a\nscreenshot of a window only and saves it as a file to the desktop\n\n*Command+Control+Shift+3: take a screenshot of the entire screen\n(screens if multiple monitors), and saves it to the clipboard for\npasting elsewhere\n\n*Command+Control+Shift+4, then select an area: takes a screenshot of \nselection and saves it to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere\n\n*Command+Control+Shift+4, then space, then click a window: takes a\nscreenshot of a window and saves it to the clipboard for pasting\n\n\nI would suggest using the first one (Command-Shift-3), taking a capture of the webpage with the coupon, opening that file that gets created (located on your desktop) and then printing that.\n\nA: Thanks for helping!  I can't provide a screenshot as my frustration and time constraints prompted me to do a hard shutdown.  All seems well with the computer.  I was concerned with damage to the IMac.  I've been a pc user forever and just switched over.  Thanks again.\n", "Q: Apple Music and gift cards I'm in a country where Apple Music is not available (Morocco) and I have an apple ID that I use with my all of my iDevices. Will I be able to use Apple Music using a gift card (25$ one)? \nAlso, what about the free, 3 month trial? Will I lose the 25$ or they will just use the gift card to verify the account? \n\nA: According to Apple, Apple music isn't available in Morocco, meaning that even is you use a gift card that you can't use it.\nOther then that, you need to use a credit card to even use the 3 month free trial.\nYou can see the available countrys that Apple music is available in here.\n", "Q: Restore a repaired iPhone 5 from backup I had a ton of problems with my iPhone 5. I backed it up and took it to the Apple Store. I got a loaner while getting it fixed and put the latest iPhone backup on loaner phone. Then I got my iPhone back and went to restore from same backup, butd it's not in my options in iTunes. Where could I find this restore point as it has everything in it? Any help would be great. Thank you. \n\nA: You have to make a backup of the loaner phone to have it available to restore on your repaired phone.\nYou already appear to have done so on your phone, but if needed, steps described by Apple are:\n\nMake a backup using iTunes\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes and connect your device to your computer. \n  \n*Save content that you downloaded from the iTunes Store or App Store by clicking File > Devices > Transfer Purchases. If you're using Windows and you don't see a File menu, press the Alt key.\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n*Wait for iTunes to finish transferring your purchases. Then, click File > Devices > Back up. If you're using Windows and you don't see a File menu, press the Alt key.\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n*After the process ends, you can see if your backup finished successfully by clicking iTunes Preferences > Devices. You should see the name of your device with the date and time that iTunes created the backup.\n  \n  \n  \nFollow more steps if you need help making an iTunes backup. Learn how to encrypt your backup.\n\n\nA: The original-phone backup should definitely still be there, and be available. Perhaps you were sent back a replacement iPhone, running a slightly older version of iOS? If the backup is from a newer version of iOS than the target device, iTunes won't show it as an option.\nThe best thing to do is to first double-check that the backup is there, by going to the Devices section of the iTunes Preferences window. That will show you all of the backups iTunes recognizes as backups :) Let's make sure the backup you want is still listed there.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi Interfering with Bluetooth Mouse I have an issue with my Logitech MX Master when trying to connect to my Macbook Pro (Early 2015 retina base model) via Bluetooth. The mouse has a stable performance only when Wi-Fi is turned off. Once Wi-Fi is turned on, however, the mouse gets really laggy. The cursor skips/jumps randomly, and the mouse's connection becomes very spotty and sometimes flat out disconnects. \nI've been reading other posts on Stack Exchange and Apple's forums, and it seems many other people have had similar issues. Is there any workaround? This issue is proving to be a huge inconvenience :(\nAlso, how come my mouse keeps having to reconnect as a new bluetooth device every time I pair it, instead of having it paired to the previously connected slot. Here's an image to show what I mean, since it's kind of confusing to put into words:\n\n\nA: I moved over the MX to band 2, then turned my wifi  off and back on. Everything is fine now. \n", "Q: When I click and delete a message, how does Mail.app decide which to select next? In Mail.app (8.2 on Yosemite 10.10.3), when I click a message in the list (preview is on the right) and delete it (using keyboard or mouse), it seems quite random as to whether Mail will move the selection to the message above the one I just deleted:\n\nor the one below:\n\nThis often results in my deleting a bunch of messages I didn't mean to as I click the top of a list of e.g. build notifications and hit delete multiple times, expecting it to work down through this list, but instead it moves upwards.\nI've tried various things - for example I thought it seemed to correlate with my most recent keyboard navigation in the list - if I hit up arrow, then click a mail, then hit delete it would move up, but it's not consistently that either.\nAnyone got an explanation, and preferably a solution?\nEDIT: here's a video of it happening. I start a sequence by hitting up arrow and pressing delete, then going click-delete repeatedly, and at the end of the video, the selection changes direction: http://youtu.be/hKq7qA3UgaM\n\nA: When you click with the mouse button on an item directly above or below the currently selected one, Mail behaves the same way as it would with the down and up arrows on the keyboard.\nWhen you hit the down or up key to select the next item in the list, Mail is programmed so that it remembers your \"working direction\". Which means when you move the selection one item downwards and delete that item, the selection moves to the next item below the currently deleted item. So this also happens when you click with the mouse on the first item below the currently selected one, which is the case in your video.\n\nA: If you want mail to ignore the sort order and always go to the \"next\" message, you can run the following command in terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail IgnoreSortOrderWhenSelectingAfterDelete 1\n\nA: I've discovered this setting:\ndefaults read com.apple.mail MessageListNextMessageDirection\n\nwhich toggles between the values 1 & 2 when I use the up or down keys in Mail.\nIs there any way to \"lock\" a default setting like this and prevent the app from changing it?\n", "Q: How to clear new Music app's cache of streaming music on iOS? I have the latest iOS on my iPad and iPhone with the new Music app. I speculate the Music app's cache of downloaded streaming songs is taking about 1.5 to 2.0 GB of space, which is causing both of my devices to now report \"storage almost full.\" This will be an issue in the future when I want to add a new app to the device. How do I clear this cache?\nSome details. I activated iCloud Music Library on both devices since I'm trying out Apple Music. My iPad previously had no local audio files, but a few days after activating iCloud Music Library, the \"Audio\" usage on the iTunes app on OSX reported about 1.5 GB. The Music app does not show up on the iPad's General>Usage>Storage page, as there is no explicitly stored music.\nMy iPhone on the other hand had locally stored songs. The phone reports Music app's usage as 3.0 GB, while the iTunes app on OSX reports 4.98 GB. \nEDIT: Auto music downloads are disabled on both devices\n\nA: Easiest solution I have found so far is to disable the iCloud Music Library and open the Music app so that it can delete the cached files and/or release that storage to iOS to clear when needed.\nDetails: This solution is an adaptation of solutions I found for the same issue with iTunes Match. The clearing and rebuilding of your music library takes time, so I hope Apple adds a simple \"clear Music cache\" button to the settings in the future.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings>Music: Turn off iCloud Music Library\n\n*Open Music app: Your library should start to clear\n\n*Settings>Music: Turn on iCloud Music Library\n\n*Open Music app: Your library will be rebuilt\n\n\nThe process preserved my offline copies of songs previously synced to my iPhone prior to switching to the iCloud Music Library. I am not sure if it preserves offline Apple Music copies.\n\nA: Actually, you can go onto iExplorer, click the Media tab, and delete the CloudAssets & LoFICloudAssets (I think), those two folders are where the Apple Music song caches are stored.\n\nA: Ok everybody, there is a problem with the Music app, somehow my downloaded music just disappeared, then I had to re-download them, but the available space at the phone storage just filled up, didn't matter if I eliminated every single download.\nUsing iExplorer, founded a folder \"Purchases\" at media's tab and there was 2gb of downloaded music, unavailable to play at the Apple Music's app. After I eliminated those files, my \"Others\" used space just flushed.\n\n\nA: I found that if I try and rent a movie from the iTunes Store that definitely won't fit on my device then it triggers a phone wide/app wide cache clear that can clear a GB or more of space. \nI always pick one of the 99c movies to rent just in case I did end up renting it. To date I've never been charged for attempting to rent a movie that won't fit on my device.\nUpdate: apparently it's better to try to download a large free app instead that won't fit and trigger a system wide cache clearance: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3967672/Running-space-iPhone-Download-HUGE-app-Simple-hack-tricks-handsets-providing-storage.html\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) Dual External Monitor Performance According to the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) Technical Specifications, the Graphics and Video Support for the 2015 Retina MBP 13-inch is:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Intel Iris Graphics 6100  \n  \n*Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors.\n  \n\nThere exist answered questions here on the Apple Stack Exchange about what's possible in terms of dual external monitors for this MBP. I understand that, as shown by the above quoted text, it is possible to run two 4K monitors with the MBP.\nMy question is concerned with the actual performance of using two full 2160p/4K external monitors with (at least) a Mini DisplayPort connection - has anyone had any problems (flickering, or really anything negative) with this setup? Similar to  this question, but for the 2015 MBP.\nI guess the performance may vary with the brand of monitor, but I'm just looking for a general idea of how well it does. I'm interested in knowing about how it would function before I make the costly investment.\nI know the Intel Iris Graphics 6100 are integrated and use up to 1.5GB RAM of the MBP, but I don't know if that will mean a stable, reliable experience with two 4K monitors. I also know the Retina 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro uses a discrete graphics card, which may be more suitable, but I'm not interested in the 15-inch screen.\n\nA: I had this exact same question, and found the answer on Apple's discussion forums:\n\nA final update - I got my hands on two Dell P2715Q's which support 3840x2160@60Hz over SST. I'm happy to report the new 13\" RMBP happily drives both displays at their native resolutions with 60Hz refresh in single stream mode (the default).\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6868583\n", "Q: How do I turn on HomeSharing without original remote?

DiskWarrior or something along those lines.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s Lock/Power Button Sticky I am using an old 4S and the Power Button is kind of half stuck down. Are there any hints or tricks out there to un-stuck it?\n\nA: The only thing that I can think of is using Assistive Touch, which allows you to lock your device without ever actually touching the lock button.  Other than that, I would say just get the button replaced or buy a new phone - sorry!\n\nA: Same tragedy happens with me as well , one month ago, my iPhone 4S absolutely broke and I was not able to access it again, fortunately My elder bro had another iphone that was just swapped out with the motherboard. As per my knowledge the Buttons only work for a short time I easily replaced it.\n", "Q: Does the Apple Watch have more processing power than a Cray 2 Supercomputer? I remember growing up in the 80's and my parents would be astounded that the Commodores and Apple II's of the time would be as powerful as a computer that used to take up a room. (I didn't quite get it at the time). At that time the most powerful computer was a Cray. \nNow the tables have turned. Moore's Law continues to march and now I'm the one who is astounded. \nAssumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terms of metrics, I'm interested in instructions/calculations per second. \n\n\nMy question is: Does the Apple Watch have more processing power than a Cray 2 Supercomputer?\n\nA: Thanks to the table on Experts Exchange, it would appear to be safe to say that the Apple Watch is more powerful than a Cray-2: Twice as fast, twice the memory.\n2 excerpts from that table well worth a look in its entirety:\n\n\n", "Q: Turn Wifi off/on with a single key? Is there a way to assign the WiFi on/off function to one of the function keys like F4 that I otherwise never use? I assume Applescript would be required. However I may want to use a BASH script instead.\n\nA: A slight improvement on the great answer of Drew Ogryzek worked (better) for me. The following script doesn't make any assumptions on which network adapter is used for WiFi:\nset_wifi_on_or_off() {\n  networksetup -getairportpower en${n} | grep \": ${1}\";\n  if test $? -eq 0;\n  then\n    echo WiFi interface found: en${n};\n    eval \"networksetup -setairportpower en${n} ${2}\"\n    return 0;\n  fi\n  return 1;\n}\n\nfor n in $(seq 0 10);\ndo\n  if set_wifi_on_or_off \"On\" \"off\"; then break; fi;\n  if set_wifi_on_or_off \"Off\" \"on\"; then break; fi;\ndone\n\n\nA: Thanks to budakpisang for this:\nIn Terminal, run\nnetworksetup -listnetworkserviceorder | sed -n '/Wi-Fi/s|.*Device: \\(.*\\)).*|\\1|p'\n\nto get your WiFi network device (usually it's en0 or en1, depending on the Mac model you have). Substitute it for en1 in the following steps\nYou can turn wifi off and on with these commands\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 off\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 on\n\nHere's a one-liner to toggle between on and off\nnetworksetup -getairportpower en1 | grep \"On\" && networksetup -setairportpower en1 off || networksetup -setairportpower en1 on\n\nCreate a keyboard shortcut that runs a shell command\n\n*\n\n*Start Automator, and create a new Quick Action.\n\n\n*Set \"Service receives selected: to \"no input\" in \"any application\".\n\n\n*Add an action named \"Run Shell Script\". It's in the Utilities section of the Actions Library.\n\n\n*Insert the bash command you want into the text box and test run it using the Run button (top right). It should do whatever the script does (off, on or toggle), and there should be green ticks below the Action.\n\n\n*Save it, giving it a service name you can remember.\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard, and go to the Shortcuts tab\n\n\n*Go to the Services section, and scroll down to General - you should find your service there. If you select the line, you can click \"add shortcut\" and give it a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: Sharing that great answer onto multiple iCloud devices was unfortunately not as simple as setting it locally. The following answer will work for the expanded use case.\nOn the first device, export this workflow from Automator to iCloud's default Automator folder.  Then open it manually from iCloud on your other Mac.  Tell Automator to Duplicate the workflow file, and now when you Save that, Automator contextually can save it to your local Services library, which triggers the workflow to appear to the keyboard shortcut list as before.\nBackground explanation:\nI tell Automator to export The night manager's Automator workflow to iCloud.  But when I again open and run this in Automator on an older MacOS device, it will not appear in System Preferences' Keyboard \"Shortcuts tab\" in the Services - General list to receive a key combination.  It did on my first device, just as Drew Ogryzek's answer step 7 describes, but because I haven't needed to modify the workflow in any way, the Automator file-menu won't let me save it as anything other than the same file in the iCloud folder. This, however, fails to trigger it to appear to System Preferences.  \n\nA: Just press the wifi key on the keyboard. f12 on US standard keyboard. why are you guys making it too hard.?\n\nA: I just tried it and this worked for me.\nUsing Spotlight launch System Preferences, then begin type wifi and hit enter, use the tab and arrows keys to navigate through the window items until select \"wifi\" and then \"turn wifi on\" and thats it. No code but also no hotkeys, just some keyboard navigation.\n", "Q: Time Machine on Mac Does the Time Machine program backup system plus data ?\nWill is restore the computer exactly to what is was including both system and data (ie. emails, photos, documents) ?\n\nA: Time Machine backs up all content, excluding data you've excluded in the Time Machine preferences pane, most system caches/temporary files, and any data listed in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist's ExcludeByPath key.\nWhen you restore from a Time Machine backup, all data is as it was when the last backup was performed. A perfect replica, from the user's side. \nCertain Microsoft Office products may notice a change if you restore your Time Machine backup to another computer/hard drive, as it uses the hard drive's serial number to validate software authenticity.\n\nA: Yes, it will create an exact copy of what is on your hard drive at that time, including every little email or conversation stored.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro - Faulty keyboard short circuit at video connector I have a 2010 13\" Macbook Pro. A few days back, the middle row of the keyboard (i.e. the keys from A-L) stopped working. Since the laptop was not under warranty I thought I would give checking the problem and repairing if possible. I opened the backcase and also opened few of the screws on the motherboard. However, I couldn't open it completely and abandoned the process.\nI connected everything back and when I started the laptop, the monitor was flickering. I opened the backcase again and at the point where the video connector connects to Motherboard, I pressed a little hard. The screen stopped flickering. On release, it flickered again and I pressed again. This time however, a small flashoccurred and there was a light fire. Since then, I have not been able to start the laptop. On starting, it gives a sound like starting but stops immediately after that. Attached below is a photo where I pressed and the small burn sign.\n\nI am going to give the laptop to a service center. I wanted to know whether this is a easily solvable problem or will it require motherboard replacement. I am hoping that simply replacing the connector wire will work fine.\n\nA: A short circuit will often damage other components, in this case, the graphics controller, possibly some power smoothing circuitry, resistors in-line with the shorted component would have most likely been damaged etc. In short, the logic board would need to be replaced, along with the connector/LCD. \nIt's very, very unlikely that the board would be okay after such an event.\n", "Q: The AppStore doesn't download full pack apps, which were previously bought I bought a new IPad. Started to download all my previous purchased applications, however I get only the basic versions, with an option to pay and unlock the rest of features. HOWEVER, I already purchased the full packs on each application on my previous IPad and paid a lot of money. So how can I get my full pack apps back? It's outrageous if I have to pay all over again for something I already bought.\n\nA: If you purchased the upgrade inside the app it is called an \"in-app purchase\". In-app purchases can be restored by tapping on a button inside the apps that says something like \"Restore Purchases\".\n", "Q: AppleScript: 'exists' returns true every time On every exists in AppleScript the result is true.

The way they can tell what number it's coming from is by either looking at the control bar at the top of the screen or, if they have that number in their Contacts, clicking details, clicking the \"i\" next to your contact then seeing what number of yours (or email) is in blue text instead on black.\nI know this is complicated and I wish there was a better answer to this question, but sadly Apple needs to do more work on the Messages app.\n", "Q: Display connected via DisplayPort disconnects, reconnects when resuming, resizing windows on display I have a new LG 29UM55 29\" Ultrawide monitor, resolution of 2560 x 1080, connected via DisplayPort to my 2012 MacBook Air 13\" via a Cable Matters Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable that reportedly does have pin 20 wired correctly. I had previously tried connecting via HDMI, but as the manual for the display indicates, Macs are apparently unable to use the full native resolution when connected via HDMI.\nA negative experience I'm having is that, when the MBA goes to sleep, the display appears to disconnect. This is noticeable only when waking it: the extra screen blanking of the display automatically reconnecting is almost imperceptible, and would otherwise be of negligible consequence, except for the result that all of my windows that were on that display are resized to fit on the MBA's built-in screen's resolution.\nSo, I find myself having to constantly re-maximize or rearrange windows whenever I walk away long enough for the screensaver to turn on and/or the computer goes to sleep. This is really aggravating, as I do arrange my windows quite particularly.\nMy options are seemingly thus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace cable - maybe this is a manifestation of the pin 20 problem, but the display does awaken, just dis/re-connects annoyingly.\n\n*Replace monitor - maybe something is wrong with this unit or this model?\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have another DisplayPort monitor easily accessible, but I might be able to borrow one or at least find one I can use in a store just to demonstrate that it's a DisplayPort or OS X problem and not a unit/model problem.\n\n\n*Tweak something in OS X - maybe there's a setting that I can alter that will disable this behavior, without having to disable screensaver or sleep. Suggestions welcome!\n\n*Replace MBA - I'm already planning to pick up a new Macbook Pro this month, but I don't know if I'll get it in time to be within the display's return period, should I decide to return the display. I have a feeling this is not a reliable solution, because it's unlikely that the new machine wouldn't exhibit this behavior unless the behavior would change between Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2.\n\n*??? - this is where you ingenious answerers come in.\n\n\nA: This appears to be an issue with OSX & Windows. HDMI devices are able to be queried by the connected computer to check display resolutions even when powered off, so this is a non-issue. DisplayPort devices seem to not have this feature. When Windows & OSX wakes up from a sleep state, it checks to see if the monitor is still connected but finds the DP monitor to be in powersaving mode and cannot determine if your 2560 x 1080 desktop is still there and so resizes everything down.\nWindows users appear to have a bassackwards solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect monitor via DisplayPort and HDMI/DVI\n\n*Configure Windows to mirror desktop on the 2 displays.\n\n", "Q: Very high kernel_task CPU usage after updating to Yosemite 10.10.4 I updated to 10.10.4 on July 1, and ever since I've had very high CPU usage - roughly 270%, i.e. two and a half of four processors - by kernel_task.\nIt appears on login for about five minutes, then drops to 0.  If I start Safari or Chrome or Parallels, it reappears, and this makes me wonder if it's related to the network.  I know there were DNS changes in 10.10.4 - could it be related?\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried running without external displays (there are several bugs about high CPU usage with an external monitor)\n\n*Removed all login items, and all automatically starting apps\n\n*Removed all items in /Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons, /Library/StartupItems\n\n*Checked I don't have anything odd installed. The only thing was flux, and I removed it.  I do still have Crashplan installed but ensured it was set to only work twice a week - which is not today. I also have and use Parallels Desktop 10 (latest update), and sometimes it seems the high CPU usage is related to starting it. However, quitting it does not restore CPU usage to normal.\n\n*I don't think it is heat-related; the CPU temperature is the low end of normal, and fans are running normally, and the laptop has good airflow and I can't feel \"hot\" air coming from it, only normal temperature air.\n\n*Booted in safe mode.

This makes me think it must be a kernel driver or similar issue.\n\n*I ran EtreCheck, which shows the only kexts loaded are com.parallels.kext.hypervisor (10.2.1 29006 - SDK 10.7), com.parallels.kext.netbridge (10.2.1 29006 - SDK 10.7), com.parallels.kext.usbconnect (10.2.1 29006 - SDK 10.7), and com.parallels.kext.vnic (10.2.1 29006 - SDK 10.7).\n\n*However, my battery health is 'Check Battery' - could that be related? Despite the health status, it has done 590 cycles and this model is supposed to only be consumed at 1000. Odd; not sure why that would be / what it means. \n\n*System.log: nothing obvious. I sat watching it for several minutes and didn't see anything added to it. Scrolling back showed lots of messages, but nothing that seemed like fast repeated failures or anything that might explain constant CPU usage. I browsed the other logs as well and didn't spot anything.\n\n\nExamining Activity Monitor, all CPU usage is shown as in kernel_task itself, not any descendant apps.\nI have an early 2011 model 15\" MBP, which up until 10.10.4 Yosemite ran really well on.\nAny ideas on how to analyze and resolve the issue?\nPS: Although the weather is hot (it's 35 degrees C - Europe is having a heatwave) it is unlikely to be this issue since smcFanControl shows a steady 65-67 degrees C, the low end of a normal temperature range. Both fans are spinning at 6000RPM, but that too is normal. Ambient temperature today and yesterday is the same as it was before I installed 10.10.4, but the high CPU usage of kernel_task occurred only when 10.10.4 was installed.  That's the key difference. Something in relation to 10.10.4 causes high CPU usage.\n\nA: As far as I am concerned kernel_task was always trying to tell me that the computer is running hot. It seems to be a strange countermeasure which occupies the CPU with a low energy No-Op task which prevents it from doing \"hotter\" things. So you should be looking for that \"other\" process eating up the rest of your CPU time.\nHowever I noticed very high CPU usage of Safari ever since I update do Yosemite 10.10.4. The browser visibly (in Activity Monitor) starts several processes now and two of them (Safari Networking and nsurlstoraged) routinely take up a lot of CPU, especially Safari Networking often takes more than 50% of one CPU. It seems to be less constant now, so maybe there is some \"trickle down\" effect on this one.\n\nA: Answering my own question: I visited an Apple store a couple of days ago, and they opened it up and also ran a full suite of Apple diagnostic tests (a bit like the hardware test you can boot into, but much more extensive.)  There was not much dust in the laptop; the fans were functioning normally; they have a special thermal test which tests heatsink connections and the laptop's reactions to high CPU load.  This all passed fine.\nFor others experiencing this problem, I would recommend you book an appointment at the Genius Bar and ask them to clean dust out, check the heatsinks, and run a full hardware diagnostic.  Even if you're happy opening up your Mac yourself, Apple provides its technicians with more extensive hardware diagnostic software than it provides us with.\nThe technician consulted with a few others and concluded the high kernel_task usage may simply be a software problem and recommended to reinstall Yosemite to a clean formatted disk, after a backup.  (I suspect this is the \"I don't know\" answer.)  I have not yet done this since the problem is occurring much less often now than when I posted.\n\nA: I found one post that mentioned turning off Bluetooth and didn't even mention battery issues but issues with Bluetooth devices running on low battery...none of which I have; happy to report this actually resolved the issue immediately! Kernel_task CPU went right down, battery came back on line and my MacBook is lightning fast again!\n\nA: I'll post my experience, which isn't quite a generic answer and probably not applicable to the OP.  But still might help someone with battery-related issues causing this.\nI had had an SSD failure and the repair shop (not Apple) replaced it.  And also disconnected my battery, because they found that it was warping/swelling, which is an indication of possible future battery failures (think fire).\nThey also put Sierra on the new SSD.\nBack home, I got a persistent 250-300% cpu kernel_task.  I disabled Spotlight indexing, just in case. Noticed some messages in the Console about battery.  Others about iCloud permissions, which I fixed just in case.  Still lotsa kernel_task. \nThen I took the Macbook Pro to the Genius bar.  Took them about 5-10 minutes to run a hardware test which showed that the battery sensors were failing.  Was told the kernel_task was due to this as the system assumes no battery heat data means an overheating battery (even though the system as a whole knows there is no battery).\nProblem fixed with new battery (from Apple Store).  I would also advise, if you buy a cheaper 3rd party battery, to have it put into the Mac when you buy it if possible - my much cheaper alternative in fact had the wrong connector (different year model).  And other people have reported the smart sensors not recognizing bad replacement ones and causing kernel_task CPU throttling as well.\n\nA: I was having this issue intermittently on MacOS 10.12.5 (Sierra) on a Mac Mini when playing games.\nBelow is an online statement posted by Apple posted and which helped me solve it:\nIf kernel_task is using a large percentage of your Mac CPU\nOne of the functions of the kernel task process is to help manage the temperature of your CPU.\nActivity Monitor might show that a system process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you might notice more fan activity.\nOne of the functions of kernel_task is to help manage CPU temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using it intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot, even if your Mac doesn't feel hot to you. It does not itself cause those conditions. When the CPU temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity.\nPublished Date: Feb 2, 2017\nFrom here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359\nThe above Apple statement led me to a solution. There are several causes of this. Two of them are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Broken or disconnected temperature sensor - In this case the fan is running ALL the time.\n\n*Clogged fan area - In this case fan spins up intermittently and kernal_task spins up grabbing a lot of CPU (500-1000%) during operations that generate a lot of heat, then when whatever activity causing the heat ceases it eventually stops.\n\n\nIn my cases the problem was intermittent and occurred when playing games. I solved it by taking the Mac Mini bottom off and vacuuming out the dust that was clogging the fans. This permanently eliminated the problem.\n\nA: just make a new account and move all your data to your account.. and whoola.. the kernel task is gone.. \n", "Q: Backup data from Macbook pro which won't boot I have a 13\" 2010 Macbook Pro which I am unable to boot.

On the left and just below the icon is the refresh symbol and on the right, just below the icon is a straight arrow pointing right. What does this mean? How can I get past this screen to my desktop? \n\nA: That symbol means your drive has crashed - or at least the system can no longer \"see\" the drive.\nDo you have an install disk to boot from?  If you do, use that, go into Disk Util and see if you can access your drive from there.  If not, I would look at getting a replacement drive from eBay as your's is IDE/PATA and those are hard to come by new these days.\n\nA: As @Allan said, your hard drive has a problem. You may be able to fix them with DiskWarrior and/or SpinRite. DiskWarrior will fix Mac-specific errors and will boot directly on your iBook (talk to their support to make sure they mail you something that you can boot from). SpinRite can fix drive-level data errors, but only runs on PCs (soon Intel Macs, which your iBook is not), so you'll need to completely remove the drive from the iBook and find a PC you can attach it to.\nIf you need to buy a new hard drive, these should work. The process for replacing the drive is here. It's not easy (I've done it), but is doable. (ifixit will happily sell you all the tools you need and a compatible hard drive.)\nAllan's advice about finding the boot disk that came with your iBook (or another similar computer) is excellent, so I won't repeat it. \nAs to what you're seeing, you're in the boot-choice screen.

OS X Lion I can see how to turn this behavior off in a previous question at How to set Preview to start on the last viewed page?\nBut what file is/was storing this persistent data about the last page read of a PDF in Preview ? I have experimented with deleting many cache, plist and other files associated with the Preview app, even its bookmarks and those in ~/Library/Containers and none of them seem to stop it remembering the last page read in a PDF document.\nCan someone please name the specific file where this information is stored?\nThank you.\nI'm still on Lion btw\n\nA: I’ve got it. I think. Took me a long time but I think I have worked out what’s happening. Hopefully this might be helpful to someone else.\nFirst of all I noticed locking the file in the Finder seemed to stop Preview remembering a different page. So if I opened the PDF on page 1 and then scrolled to page 10 it wouldn’t remember the PDF was on page 10 anymore when the file was closed then reopened. That was the first clue.\nI then used  fseventer which monitors file changes in real time and I was surprised to see that opening a PDF in Preview, scrolling to a different page and then closing the PDF updated the file itself.  It doesn’t literally register a time change in the Finder, the date stays the same, but fseventer threw up the clue ‘Modified xattr’.\nOk, I dimly remembered some mention of this feature called extended attributes from years back, it seems to function like yet another kind of metadata but that’s quite separate from ‘normal metadata’, and now I'm reading was a replacement for the old resource forks in OS 9. Running $mdls (used for normal 'metadata') in Terminal won’t show extended attributes.\nYou have to use the command $xattr to see these attributes.\nWhen I ran $xattr /Volumes/mydisk/mypdf.pdf I got this:\n/Volumes/mydisk/mypdf.pdf: com.apple.Preview.UIstate.v1: \nAnd another line about a quarantine bit\nYou have to do $ xattr -lv  to see the full data of these extended attributes. It produces a blob of hexadecimal output for com.apple.Preview.UIstate.v1.\nSo I ran $ xattr -lv /Volumes/mydisk/mypdf.pdf \nAnd copied the output. Then I opened the PDF in Preview, changed the page and closed Preview.\nThen I ran $ xattr -lv /Volumes/mydisk/mypdf.pdf  again\nAnd then compared the blobs of hexadecimal output for com.apple.Preview.UIstate.v1, which were different between the two occasions.\nThe final test was to delete the extended attribute data:\n$ xattr -c /Volumes/mydisk/mypdf.pdf\nAnd that’s it! It’s back to page 1 when you open it in Preview\nIt appears the last page viewed of a PDF is stored in these extended attributes. I’m so happy!! \n\nA: Using filemon from the book \"Mac OS X Internals - To The Apple's Core\" it appears the only Preview related file that's modified if all I do is open, e.g. a .pdf document in Preview and close it to a different page is the com.apple.Preview.ViewState.plist file located at:\n/Users/$USER/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/\n\nThe file is not what I'd call in friendly human readable format as it's primarily a list of UUID's which contain a Timestamp and Data key however the Data key is not in a friendly human readable format although the Timestamp key is.\nI was however able to watch the Timestamp value change on different UUID's as I opened and closed recent documents when I closed them on different pages then was opened.  So while it's the right file, not sure how much use the file will be to you.\n", "Q: Xcode storyboard vibration with the new Trackpad When I drag views around in the storyboard, the trackpad vibrates every time the view snaps to something else.

I often need to give instructions on using OS X hotkeys in documentation. I write it in markdown, usually on GitHub pages and sometimes on StackExchange. The keys are formatted with <kbd>key</kbd> = key.\nIn OS X interfaces the keys are usually listed together, with no spaces between.

I might have installed this program in past but I got rid of it. How can I completely remove all the related files from the system?\n\n\nA: Programs that install system components can't be uninstalled by simply throwing them in the Trash.\nUsually an Uninstaller is provided in the original .dmg file, or can sometimes done from within the app itself.\nIf you delete the app, you may be too late to use that method.\nMost companies that make apps which must be correctly uninstalled will have instructions on their own site as to how to achieve this, either by re-downloading the original .dmg, or they may provide a dedicated uninstaller app.\nKoingo has such an app listed on its MacCleanse Manual page \nDirect link - \nhttp://www.koingosw.com/products/maccleanse/download/maccleanse4_uninstaller.zip\n", "Q: Apple Music adds music to playlist which isn't really added to the list I currently using Apple Music since it's release and I encountered a strange problem. The first times I just thought that I've made something wrong. But now I tested it many times and won't work as expected.\nI've had a song, which I wanted to be added to a playlist on my iPhone while listening to a self defined radio station. The song before that song could be added to my playlist (clicking ... > add to playlist > choose playlist). I rechecked it and it's added to my playlist without any error. The iPhone stated that the song is successfully added to my list.\nThe next song, I tried the same thing. I tried to add it, my iPhone stated again \"added successfully\". After that, I went to the playlist to check it, and it's not there. I go back to the song and tried to add it again, again successfully but no song in the list. I tried it even on different lists and no list work! \nI tried another song and it is added successfully again and... it is really added to the playlist. Just this one song (which is normally available in the store) can't be added to my playlist. \nIs there a limit which songs can be added per day? Is this an bug? Can some songs just be streamed but not added to a playlist (I don't talk about offline availability)?\nThanks in advance for your help. I don't have any clue whats going on there.\n\nA: Well I just tested the other way round. Sorry I don't came on this on my own as I posted the question. \nI edited the playlist instead, search the currently playing song, added it and saved the playlist. This worked for me. But during the save process the iPhone really stutters heavy. It nearly freeze for a few seconds. This can be caused by the temperature currently in Germany (38 degree) but it's still strange.\nAnyway, it should still work the other way around. But if someone else encounters a behavior which is quite the same, he can try to solve it like I did.\n", "Q: MacBook Air at 5700 RPM fan speed during summer? it is unusually hot today (37 Celsius, about 100 Fahrenheit) and my MBA mid 13 fan is going crazy. The CPU temp is at 47.5 when almost idle but my fan blows with 5703 RPM (pretty much the maximum). This data is taken from iStats and the fan symbol is literally blinking red.\nIs there anything I need to worry about or is everything cool as long as the CPU is still cool? I understand that with an outside temperature almost as hot as the CPU temp, the fan needs to blow a bit more, but I am afraid the fan blasting at 100% could have some unfortunate outcome. \nGoing into my basement, it goes down to about 4000 RPM, so the fan itself does seem to react to the temperature as it is supposed to do.\n2nd question: should I decrease my MacBook use (or maybe cap the max CPU load) just to be safe or is Apple's temperature management smart enough to turn down when it's getting dangerous?\n\nA: 47.5°C is normal operating temperature and you have nothing to worry about. When your computer reaches around 100-110°C (~230°F), it will take cautionary actions. Your computer will automatically cap CPU load depending on the temperature. \nIt also depends how long you are using your computer at these hot temperatures. If you are doing CPU intensive tasks on your laptop (3D gaming, rendering, etc.) for extended periods of time, you may want to look at manually controlling the fans. iStat has built in fan control settings but I also use Macs Fan Control. In this you can increase the Fan speed and set automatic fan speeds. Do note that you shouldn't always run your computer with max fan speeds because that will slowly decay the life and effectiveness of your fans (you usually don't need to worry about this).\nIf you're like me and use your computer as a workhorse, you may want to consider purchasing an external fan (only get one if you are really stressing your computer on a daily basis).\nUsually, you don't need to do much but you can always help and care for your CPU by keeping it cool (which will extend it's life). If your computer is constantly getting very hot (~90°C) you might wan to start taking measures. 40°C is usually nothing to worry about.\nAlso, the only hot air outtake is at the bottom of the MacBook so you want to make sure those aren't covered up, if you use your MacBook on your bed, maybe even your lap, try seeing if you can get a desk to help ventilate the laptop. \nThe laptops temperature is definitely influenced by the temperature in the room.

Back up your hard drive, partition/reformat it, reinstall the OS and restore your backup. Yeah it's more complicated and a bit of a PITA but will save you money.\n\nA: I had the same issue.  I was able to fix it in an interesting way.\nI have been testing El Capitan on an external drive.  So, I thought, why not try Disk Utility using OS 10.11.x and (after the second pass) it repaired the drive.  As the Beta was on a separate disk, and the Macintosh HD was unmounted at the time, it was analyzed and repaired.  Just like using a 3rd party app.\nAt least this was a \"free\" way to fix it.  Saved the hassle of reformatting and restoring.\n\nA: This was a problem for me too. I booted from an external disk (USB stick in fact), ran disk utility, then Onyx found no problems.\n\nA: It because Disk Utility doesn't recognize all errors. \nI had the same issue before, and I fixed it by following the instructions on the onyx's Known Problem page and this guide to run\nfsck -fy\n\nunder Single User mode\n", "Q: Keeping synced keychains on same Mac Apparently Chrome will never support iCloud keychain and will use the default keychain because Apple only allows access to the former if the app is distributed through the App Store (see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=312105)\nSo I was wondering whether there's an app or script that automatically syncs between different local keychains (thereby working around the limitation imposed by Apple.) \n\nA: Although I don't actually suggest an app to sync the local keychains, I provide you with an alternative solution: you can sync the passwords between the different users in your Mac if you sync Chrome with the same Google account in both users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why sign in to Chrome - Chrome Help\n", "Q: Getting a source clip from iMovie Last year I imported a video into iMove, edited it, cut pieces, etc and I have the result as a mov, but I want to also keep the original video file.

There are localized language files for Assistant (Siri) and the rest of iOS that contain information about what certain words and language in general looks like to a computer. I'm fairly certain that these files are located at /System/Library/LinguisticData/.

Everything work as expected. I can now boot from the USB device with mavericks and I still see my internal HDD (containing Snow Leopard) with all the data untouched.\nThe problem is that I can't boot anymore from my internal HDD, even if the usb drive is not connected, I can see that the boot is \"mavericks-style\" and then fails because it doesn't find the drive.

I've tinkered with the Security & Privacy settings (i.e. \"Allow apps downloaded from\"), but that changed nothing. I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it via Homebrew Cask. Nothing. I've tried un/re-installing the app various ways multiple times. Nothing.\nThe interesting part, and perhaps a glimmer of hope, is that if I flip over to the Guest user, I can open the app just fine.\nAnyone have any idea what might be going on with my user account that would be impacting my ability to launch a particular application?\n\nA: I had the same issue on my new Macbook Air (replacing an older Macbook Pro), with the same Console message.\nDeleting the app and reinstalling had no effect, and deleting ~/Library/Application Support/Amazon Music had no effect.\nWhat eventually worked was to delete / uninstall with AppCleaner and reinstall.

So I've deleted the entire ~/Library/Application Support/Amazon Music folder! And ... da da da ... Amazon Music starts and ask for login data :-)\n\nA: For what it's worth, I found that the Amazon Music Helper app was refusing to quit and prevented me from reinstalling over the app. Activity Monitor revealed that the helper was housed in the app itself. I deleted that and was able to reinstall the newest version. \n\nA: This may not be much of an answer, but I have also had issues with 3rd party apps while using a MacBook Pro. Here are a couple things you could try:\n1. Make sure the application is capable of running on your Mac version.\n[E.g; if your computer can handle 32bit applications or 64bit] Check Amazon's website where you downloaded the application to see if they have different versions.\nAlien Skin has an article on how to make an application run 32bit, if it's supported by the app. \n2. Is your computer running the right OS X? \n[The app may only support 10.9 and above or something specific like that.] Again, check Amazon to see if they have specific versions of the app. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201260 - Find the OS X version and build information on your Mac \n3. Check if the app is in the Mac App Store. \n[The App Store version might open without difficulties.]\n\nA: This is an old enough question the answer might now be to \ndownload the most recent installer from Amazon (currently at this URL) and run that. \nThat is, the newer installer seems a bit more mature about edge cases and partial installs.\n\nLonger version:\nI was installing with a local copy of an older installer (from 2018) which caused the same issues when I didn't grant it whatever accessibility permission it wanted.\nReinstalls were no good, no matter what I deleted.\nDownloading the most recent installer from Amazon (currently at this URL) did the trick.\n", "Q: My iPhone 4s has no apps or photos but still saying memory is full My iPhone 4s has iOS version 7.1.

Last month a few of those hiccups started to occur, but in the last few days they happen more frequently (today over 50 times).\nThe graphic issues manifest in stuttering user interface, which usually means that the monitor freezes and temporarily becomes unresponsive.

UEFI is the main booting mechanism used recent computers, while old computers uses BIOS. UEFI mode requires the system to be installed on a GUID partition table (GPT) disk, and BIOS the master boot record (MBR) disk. Windows won’t allow you to restore system from UEFI based computer to bios computer, and vice versa.

Everything is working fine now except the fact that the Gigabit Ethernet port has a limit of 200mb/s when tested. If I plug the main internet cable into my computer and test the download goes to 900+mb/s but when I plug it into Airport extreme and connect to it's (gigabit) ethernet I hit that 200mb/s limit no matter what. \nI tried with different cables and whatnot, the ethernet is limited. Any ideas?\n\nA: After hours of pulling my hair out I'm going to answer my own.\nTL; DR: Airport Extreme (at least the 2013 edition which I own) is crap for gigabit networks.\nIt's advertised gigabit ports cannot go over, after much testing, 205mb/s because of the WAN to LAN routing which is horrible.\nThis is a decent wireless router but overpriced for what it offers in terms of range and Ethernet performance. If you buy a gigabit internet do not make the mistake and buy it because it can't go faster than those 200mb/s.\nAs I said, after much reading and testing, your best bet is with a device that has hardware routing and I strongly recommend you take a look at this page for comparisons of various devices in terms of \"WAN to LAN Throughput\".\nI just ordered a ASUS RT-AC87U which seems to offer a great signal and solve my gigabit issues. I will update this answer once I receive it and manage to do some testing.\n\nA: I have the same model that you, and your are partially wrong. \nI got speeds between 215 and 235mb/s on PPPoE mode, but I got 300mb/s (my cable connection speed limit) on NAT and DHCP modes. Haven't tested it on VPN Passthrough mode.\nAll test with CAT.6 cable.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Cablevision came today and upgraded me from 100mbps service to 300mbps service. I got 300+ directly out of the cable modem, but as soon as I hooked up the Airport Extreme, I could get no more than 100mbps, ethernet or wifi. \nEventually figured it was a router issue, so I called Apple and after getting sent to Level 1 tech support, did hard resets, upgraded, then downgraded firmware, tried a dozen different things. Nothing. It was elevated to Engineering, and I was told to expect to hear from them next week.\nAfter a bit of thought, I suspected my ethernet was being capped at 100base-t, so started considering how I could test that. Suddenly I remembered that back in the day, the switch always had to be connected to WAN/cable modem via a crossover cable. Hm.\nDug in my ancient wire nest in the basement and found a crossover cable. Connected the cable modem to the Airport with it. Bam. 300mbps at the desktop, ether and wifi. 300mbps to my PHONE.\nI don't know what the issue that makes this necessary but a crossover cable is a quick (and for me permanent) fix.\n", "Q: Can Airport Extreme be configured to work with a free dynamic DNS service? I have an Airport Extreme and wish to set up Dynamic DNS (DDNS) so that I can remotely access my home WiFi security cameras when I'm traveling.  I'm seeing certain things that say the built-in dynamic DNS client in the Airport, which I need to use since my Mac will be traveling with me, uses obscure protocols that aren't supported by many accounts.  Is there a free dynamic DNS provider I can use (or the one from Foscam) that will work with the Airport?\n\nA: Apple's Airport Extreme doesn't have DDNS support built in so it can't update the service itself. But it also doesn't prevent any other client from talking to the DDNS service and updating the records to point to the Airport.\nYou don't need to be on the router to get your public IP address; you can get get it from any client anywhere on your network that has Internet access.\nThe basic way DDNS works is that \n\n\n*\n\n*You set up a DDNS domain and account to which you will sync periodically to.\n\n*The DDNS client requests an update from the DDNS server; the client and server authenticate, and compare the IP address the client is sending with the IP address in the DNS record.\n\n*If the records are the same, nothing is done and you continue on.  If there is an update, the server updates its DNS record.\n\n*The DDNS DNS server propagates those changes throughout the Internet meaning GoDaddy's, Google's, etc. will accept the changes.\n\n*At some point, this change hits your ISP and their DNS servers so a nslookup of your IP address will return the correct domain name.\nI had a router that didn't support DNS, so I created a script that ran via cron on my web dev server VM that updated it; it worked with no problem.  So, in reference to your \"answer\", it's your IP cameras that are doing the DDNS updates for you.\n\nA: I don't believe the Airport Extreme \"speaks\" to No-IP. It looks like No-IP sets your DDNS address to the one from which you set up the account, but does not accept further updates from the Airport. It's hard to understand why everyone needs to use a different API for something so simple as conveying IPaddr info. It's also annoying that Apple provides no info on which DDNS service(s) they support.\n\nA: I tried no.ip but they don't support Airport extreme.\nNow im using https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/Apple-Airport this one is free but to configure the airport extreme you need to pay their membership of 10$ / month\n\nA: It is very simple to get dynamic dns working on your apple router with duiadns.net. Here's a blog post that might help you with that: https://www.duiadns.net/running-duiadns-on-apple-router\n\nA: I have been trying the free account for NoIP (noip.com).  My Airport Extreme has accepted it without complaint, but I found that my Foscam IPTV cameras have a built-in DDNS client so I don't know whether updates are happening from them or the Airport.  I am running 7.7.3 firmware on the Airport.\n", "Q: Print Diff of two text files I'd like to compare two text files on a paper. Which app should I use to print a diff of two files?\nI know several apps to show diff on a screen and usually use MacVim.

Just bought a new MacBook Pro 12.1, early 2015 (Yosemite 10.10.4). I'm observing memory usage from kernel_task varying between 0.8-2.0 GB. Is it normal? Couldn't find a question referring to normal values.\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, that amount is normal. \nAs kernel_task performs a lot of tasks on behalf of user-space processes (i.e. the ordinary programs you're running on your computer), the actual memory usage of kernel_task will vary a lot according to which programs you're currently running, and what you're doing with them.\n", "Q: Ipod Classic not recognized by iTunes (Windows 8.1) I have an 80GB iPod classic that is not being recognized by iTunes.

I seemingly see the words package and bundle used interchangeably in Apple documentation referring to a special folder in the file system that the user sees as document (iWork Pages document) or application (Pages.app). I know one can view the contents of a package or bundle by right clicking on one of these special files and clicking Show Package Contents. Which suggests to me that both are are a type of package. So is a bundle a special type of package?\n\nA: From Apple's Bundle Programming Guide\n\nAlthough bundles and packages are sometimes referred to interchangeably, they actually represent very distinct concepts:\nA package is any directory that the Finder presents to the user as if it were a single file.\nA bundle is a directory with a standardized hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code.\n\nAlso\n\nThe Finder considers a directory to be a package if any of the following conditions are true:\nThe directory has a known filename extension: .app, .bundle, .framework, .plugin, .kext, and so on.\nThe directory has an extension that some other application claims represents a package type; see Document Packages.\nThe directory has its package bit set.\n\nIn code with bundles and packages are manipulated by the same NSBundle class\n\nA: A package and a bundle have/have had similar structure. A package is a \"file\" that is operated on by the OSX Installer. These days packages have been flatten into an xar archives. Packages are also \"files\" created by some Apple applications, where the file is actually a directory with multiple supporting files. A bundle contains executable code, an application (.app) is a bundle. Plugins are also bundles.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina – \"Battery Is Not Charging\" My Retina MacBook Pro is currently on 4% battery power, but when I plug it in, the battery icon up the top shows the plug icon instead of the lightning bolt icon inside it to say it's charging and stays on the same 4%. How can I fix this so that my laptop charges fully?\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: This happens to me too. I clean the connectors, especially the area around the pins on the computer case. This is a very small area; last time I used a heavy paper stock card and cleaned out any dust or debris that might have been there. Problem solved!  This has happened to my computer a few times and the solution is always getting either the power connector pins clean, or the metal areas immediately adjacent cleaned. It could be a grounding issue.\n\nA: The same happened to me after disconnecting my MacBook Pro Retina (late 2013) and then exhausting the battery on a Netflix marathon. \nI left my MacBook unplugged for several days and then it began charging again.\n\nA: The message indicates that the charger is not giving as much energy as is required for your computer not to lose charge when working normally. If you use the computer lightly, or you suspend it, or shut it down, you will get a slow recharge.\nThe cause for the low charge can be either a dirty Magsafe/USB-C socket, a faulty power supply, a misconfigured System Management Controller (SMC) —as indicated elsewhere—, or a self-resetting fuse in the power supply.\nIn this last case, removing the power supply from the wall socket and waiting a couple of minutes can resolve it.\nIf the issue is the SMC, you can follow the method indicated by Apple in their support document about \"How to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac\".\nAnd if the issue is a dirty socket, you can try to use a compressed air can, or something like that, to blow away the dirt.\n\nA: I have had charging problems with my early 2013 (13 inch) MacBook Pro with retina display.  I replaced several charging adapters and have had the charging port on the computer replaced.  All replacements and the repair were more or less temporary.  I believe the problem is that the computer requires high current to charge, particularly when the battery is at a low charge level.  The current appears to be passing through only two pins of the five pins on at the magnetic connection.  Once the pins heat up, they tarnish and then are not able to conduct current well, causing them to heat even more.  The problem eventually will prevent current from passing through the connection and stop the computer from charging.  I just had the power adaptor replace and before using it, I vigorously rubbed a white pencil eraser over the pins (which are actually dimples) on the computer power socket.  I will continue to inspect the pins on both the adaptor and the computer and clean them as needed with a white pencil eraser.\nI think the connection is a design flaw, particularly with the retina displays, which needs more charging current than the standard displays. Apple has changed their charger connections on the newer MacBook Pros, but they don't admit that there is a problem with the Mag Safe connection.\n", "Q: OS X - 'Clickable' script to erase files? I use Latex to write my documents. Latex creates MANY auxiliary files to compile a document. I often times want to clean my working directory.\nWhen I was working on Windows, I used to keep a .bat file in the working directory that looked like this:\ndel *.aux\ndel *.pdf\ndel *.log\ndel *.bak\ndel *.gz\ndel *.bbl\ndel *.blg\n\nwhich I could just click on to get rid of all auxiliary files.\nNow, I want to do the same on my Mac. I have created a .sh file like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd `pwd`\n\necho \"Cleaning files...\"\n\nrm *.aux\nrm *.bak\nrm *.bbl\nrm *.blg\nrm *.gz\nrm *.log\nrm *.pdf\n\necho \"Done!\"\n\nwhich I know I can run (i.e. invoke from command line), but I cannot click on - which is more convenient because not always I will be using Terminal.\nHow can I convert this script into a \"clickable\" one? \nI appreciate any input!\n\nA: Create a text file like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\" || {\n    echo \"Error changing directory.\" >&2\n    exit 1\n}\n\necho \"Cleaning files...\"\n\nrm *.aux\nrm *.bak\nrm *.bbl\nrm *.blg\nrm *.gz\nrm *.log\nrm *.pdf\n\necho \"Done!\"\n\nGive it a \".command\" extension, and add execute permission to it. This will make it automatically open and run in Terminal when it's double-clicked.\nNote that there are two important differences (and one minor one) between this and @thiagoveloso's script:\n\n\n*\n\n*It uses double-quotes around the path it's cding to, which will prevent problems if any directory names contain spaces (which is entirely normal on OS X).\n\n*It checks for errors while cding, and if there was a problem it exits (rather than deleting files in an unexpected location). Always check for errors on any script command that affects what the rest of the script will do; cd is a good example of this.\n\n*(Minor) It cds directly to the script's directory (rather than cding there, capturing that location in a variable, then cding there again based on the variable).\n\n\nA: Based on this reference (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in), I ended up solving my problem with the following code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDIR=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )\" && pwd )\n\necho \"Cleaning files...\"\n\ncd $DIR\nrm *.aux\nrm *.bak\nrm *.bbl\nrm *.blg\nrm *.gz\nrm *.log\nrm *.pdf\n\necho \"Done!\"\n\n#read -p \"Press [Enter] to continue...\"\n\nIt works very well to clean all the nasty files left behind by Texmaker!\n", "Q: iTunes downloading movie faster over WiFi For some reason iTunes will download a movie faster over wifi than with ethernet on my home network. When I do a speed test the ethernet connection appears to be a few mbps faster though... Why would it download slower on ethernet? (I turn wifi off when using ethernet via the thunderbolt adapter)\n\nA: I know what your trying to ask here. When you do you speed test are you downloading the movie at the same time? If yes then the mbps will consistently change so when your over wifi and when your switching back to ethernet. If your were not downloading a movie when doing the speed test there is the difference already, when toe downloading something it using more data that means if more people are using the Internet as well then it will consistently change again.\nTo put it into a perspective, image your router has 20 (whatever of 20). Your wife logs on 20 goes to her then you log on splits 10 & 10 then you have let's say your friend over now it's uneven so your each getting 6.6 from the router. You see how it keeps getting smaller so there are so many factors that play in to make it better with Ethernet or better wirelessly. \n", "Q: Remove all files in folder apart from one using OS X Terminal I would like to remove the whole content of a folder, apart from one file. The problem is can't copy the file to another folder and then back to the first folder, because then the application doesn't accepts the file, so the one file must stay in the folder.\nExists there a command like I described?\n\nA: I would go about it like this:\nfind . ! -name <filename> -delete\n\nfor this to work with folders, you have to replace the delete with an exec rm -r\nfind . ! -name <filename> -exec rm -rv {} \\;\n\nThis breaks down to\nfind = find\n. = in current working directory, you can replace . with a path, like ~/Documents/\n! = not\n-name = name\n<filename> = file\n-exec = execute\nrm -rv = verbose remove \n{} = results of the find\n\\; = close the execution\nFind all files and folders in your working folder, that do not have the name filename and then execute the remove command on the results.\nYou should do a dry run without the delete option, first:\nfind . ! -name <filename>\n\nThis command gives you a list of all files and folders in your working directory that are not named <filename>. Adding -delete or -exec rm -rv {} \\;, will delete this files and folder (the exec version).\n\nYou could also use\nrm -v [^filename]\n\nfor folders add -r\nrm -rv [^filename]\n\nSomehow I feel more comfortable using the find option. Mainly because you can do a dry run. Either way I would start with a dummy folder and try both options.\n\nA: For being really sure about this, you could use find to create a deletion shellscript with \"rm\" commands:\nfind . ! -name \"<filename>\" -exec echo \"rm -rf {}\" >> /tmp/rm.sh \\;\n\nDelete every line in the shellscript /tmp/rm.sh you do not like, then execute it by\nbash /tmp/rm.sh\n\nBut be careful - find also finds directories and \"rm -rf\" would then delete them recursively as well! Narrow down your search by telling find the filetype to search for:\nfind . ! -name \"<filename>\" -type <filetype> -exec echo \"rm -rf {}\" >> /tmp/rm.sh \\;\n\nHave fun! :-)\n", "Q: How to download game center?

Manual\n-p pattern\n         The file is split whenever an input line matches pattern,\n         which is interpreted as an extended regular expression.  The\n         matching line will be the first line of the next output file.\n         This option is incompatible with the -b and -l options.\n\nCode\nseq -w 1 1 10 | gsed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\\n//g' | split -p '060'\n\nwhich makes a sequence from 1 to 10, removes empty lines to have a megastring and then splits at 060 into two files unsuccessfully giving split: invalid option -- 'p'. \nCommand seq -w 1 1 10 | awk -F'060' '{print \"field1: \"$1 \"\\nfield2: 060\"$2}' in comment gives \n\nfield1: 01 field2: 060 field1: 02 field2: 060 field1: 03 field2: 060 field1: 04 field2: 060 field1: 05 field2: 060 field1: 06 field2: 060 field1: 07 field2: 060 field1: 08 field2: 060 field1: 09 field2: 060 field1: 10 field2: 060\n\nwhich is not what I want. \nI want to split the file at the mark 060 to two files. You can include 060 to either file. \nHow can you use the flag -p in BSD Split in OSX?\n\nA: The issue is caused by BSD split being later in your path than the GNU split (which doesn't support the -p option). If you do an echo $PATH you should see this - /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin will be before /usr/bin in the output.\nTo call BSD split directly, use the full path - pipe to /usr/bin/split instead of split.\nYour original command will then become:\n\nseq -w 1 1 10 | gsed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\\n//g' | split -p '060'\n\n\nA: split operates on multiple line files not on a single line file or string. In the example below I'm using jot because seq in not on my system. Also I'm using BSD sed with an addition that changes the marker 060 to a colon. This produces the string 0102030405:7080910. We add the 060 back into the second file.\n    jot -w \"%02d\" 10 1                                     |\n    sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\n//g' -e 's/060/:/'|\n    IFS=: read -r one two\n    echo \"$one\" > file1\n    echo \"060${two}\" > file2\n\n", "Q: Why BSD eval cannot run gtime?

Command which eval gives nothing. \nWhy GNU time cannot run eval?\n\nA: gtime can't execute/time commands definied internally by the shell. Commands are executed using the exec() system call, but the system call basically only knows about commands with binaries (e.g. in /usr/bin). Builtin commands are included in the shell binary, there is no way for exec() to execute them.\nYou need to either find a way to execute the command without relying on shell builtins or use the internal time command of your shell. One option might (should work, but I have no means of testing it right now) be to run a new shell within gtime \ngtime bash -c 'eval $(echo sed $(for i in 1 2 3 5; do echo \"-e ${i}p\"; done) -n data.txt)'\n\nThe timing will be slightly off because the time required to run a new shell is included, but you can measure that seperately by running gtime bash -c ':'.\n", "Q: 2008 MacBook Air Can't Boot OS X Snow Leopard USB Install Drive I have a 2008 MacBook Air (MB003LL/A / MacBookAir1,1 / A1237 / 2142), and I am trying to reformat it with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, using the retail install DVD image snowleopard_10a432_userdvd.dmg restored to a USB flash drive with Disk Utility.

As far as i know, there are only two ways to get altitude, by GPS or by barometer. GPS is not usable in indoor room, And iPhone5 doesn't have a barometer. But iPhone 5 can give a relative accurate altitude without barometer. How could it be possible?\n\nA: The iPhone does have two ways to get altitude, but the barometer is not one of them. You can only use a barometer for relative altitudes, not absolute, unless you know the current atmospheric pressure at sea level. But as well as GPS, Apple maintains a database of the locations (presumably including altitude) of a vast number of wifi networks, so if the wifi is enabled it can determine the altitude from the database. Try turning off wifi on your phone, and see if it can still get your altitude.\n\nA: All GPS sensors in our phones can determine altitude, just like it can determine your precise location, since GPS was designed to give 3D coordinate.\n", "Q: Mac book Pro to Dell E2414H monitor issue I am trying to connect my MBP with my DELL monitor. I have purchased an HDMI to VGA adapter(converter). when I connect them, my MBP flashes on and off intermittently and my external monitor says nothing is connected. I have checked and rechecked all the connections but am having no luck. \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Adapters can be finicky things.  I have had mixed results even with genuine Apple display adapters.  You would think something this simple would be a no-brainier; just buy, plug in and go to work.  It may be the adapter itself that is giving you problems so you will want to return it and get another.\nHowever, as has been previously stated, you should be using the DVI port.  The VGA is analog and while not \"bad\" per se, you are not getting the full performance of your monitor by using VGA and you may be introducing issues like what you are experiencing because the the DP to VGA adapter has to convert digital video signals to analog.  Then, interestingly enough, the monitor has to convert the analog signal back to digital.  \nWhy not just go digital end-to-end?\nI personally used this cable with great results  Mini Display Port to DVI.  This one is Thunderbolt compatible as well.  \nWhy this and not an adapter and a separate DVI cable?  I prefer having a single connection end-to-end as the more connections you make means more points-of-failure.  That cable above has worked for me on several MacBooks, an iMac27 and a Surface Pro 3 tablet.\nI hope that helps.  \n\nA: Looking at the specs for the Dell E2414H monitor, it has a DVI (digital) connector. What you need is a Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter.\nUnfortunately, it appears that Apple no longer sells such an adapter (they used to have it last summer).\nLooking at Newegg, here is an example of the adapter that you need.\n\nA: First off: In principal your approach should work. Unfortunately it clearly doesn't for you. As suggest by Vzzdak. You can try a  Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter\n", "Q: Why doesn't the 'rm' command dump file in Trash? Using the rm 'filename' command, i have noticed that the file isn't actually deposited into the trash.\nI realise that this isn't completely removing the file from the computer, however im perplexed as to why it would not appear in the trash?\nIn short:\nWhy doesn't the 'rm' command deposit file in trash.\n\nA: Actually when you use 'rm' you are deleting the file directly. When you delete a file from the Finder it actually moves it to the Trash, that is it doesn't delete it.\nIf you want to move the file to the Trash instead of deleting it try:\nmv fileName ~/.Trash/\n\nWhat this does is it moves the file called fileName to your user's trash. The '~' means your user's directory and .Trash is your trash (the dot before Trash means it's a hidden file). After trying this command open the Trash from the finder and your file should be there.\nAlso, if you want to play around with files I would recommend to use fictitious files. You can easily create files using the touch command which creates an empty file if it doesn't exist:\ntouch newFile\n\nSo if you want to test my solution you should do this (where $ is the prompt):\n$touch newFile\n$mv newFile ~/.Trash/\n\nAnd you should see newFile in the Trash.\n\nA: rm is a standard Unix command and Unix does not always have trash. At the programming level the BSD API does not have a system call to trash a file, Apple supplies those at a higher level.\nAlso  you need a command that deletes files e.g. to remove them from trash and rm happens to be it. You need another command to put a file in trash.\n\nA: You may want to use rmtrash (available on http://www.nightproductions.net/cli.htm or using homebrew), which moves a file to the trash.\n", "Q: Dual-Boot Win7 and Apple? First off, I have no idea what Apple calls their OS. I only use their iOS devices and I tried to avoid their computer OS as best as possible, however, I'm getting started in developing iOS apps. I need to either run the Apple OS in a VM or set up dual-booting. I have a few questions though that hopefully can get answered.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I purchase a license for Apple?\n\n*I've never set up dual-booting before, how do I go about doing so with Win7 as my current OS? (Ideally using a different HDD)\n\n*Is there anything I should know before going ahead?\n\nA: Quite simply, you purchase a license for OS X by buying a Mac. It is licensed only for Apple hardware. \nThere is no other way to legitimately run it, either natively or in VM. \nRunning it on any other hardware would be against Apple's EULA & would also be off-topic for StackExchange. \n\nA: I do this on my MacBook using Bootcamp which comes with the Mac OS. It allows me to partition off my hard drive into 2 and by holding down the Alt key when the Mac boots, it asks which OS I'd like to start. I can only use one at a time though. Recently I prefer to just run a VM of Windows from inside my Mac OS using VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Collection of albums in iTunes? Essentially a playlist of albums? From within iTunes (or Music on iOS), is it possible to make a collection of full albums that is separate from my main library? So, essentially, a playlist of albums. \nI know that I can put all songs from an album into a playlist, but that's not exactly what I need to do. It comes down to the fact that I have a fairly substantial music library. I'm an album-centric music consumer... meaning I tend to listen to full albums as opposed to individual songs. I want to be able to group albums in my collection based on mood, genre, release date, theme, whatever. So again, a playlist of albums is really the best way to describe it.\nMaybe I'm going about this all wrong. Open to suggestions!\n\nA: There does seem to be a way to make Smart Playlists that only include whole albums - you need to love ('Heart') the album (not the individual tracks) and then use \"Album is Loved\" as one of your smart playlist conditions.\nStrangely it seems to only work on my home library - my work laptop with iCloud Match messes up the albums - but it seems to work for my iPad and iPhone syncing, which was my purpose, as I like to listen to whole albums not random tracks.\n\nA: Theres not really a way to make a playlist of albums the way that you are explaining it. You can however, as you said, add all of the songs from a album.\n\nA: I have listened to Exile on Main St. every day for abouta month and got sick of selecting Artists › Rolling Stones › Exile on Main St.\nBased on David G's answer here is one solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Artist View in iTunes\n\n*Click on the ... to the right of the album cover and check Loved \n\n*Make a smart playlist where Album Love is Loved\n\n*Under the View menu select View as Albums\nYou can now access this playlist on your phone, etc. and you'll have a list of your favorite albums in order.\nUnfortunately, it will be a giant list of songs, ordered by album name but at least you'll be able to avoid going through all the albums you didn't want to see.\n\nA: Here's a hack that I use to quickly get to my favorite albums without a lot of scrolling.\nSince the iPhone doesn't provide an album view for playlists, substitute single songs for albums:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new iTunes playlist Favorite Albums with the first song of each favorite album\n\n*On your iPhone, go to the new playlist and tap on the album you want\n\n*Tap on the song name at the bottom of the screen (with the pause icon) to get into the main song view\n\n*Tap the • • • in the bottom right corner of the screen then on the album name\n\n*Tap Play to start the album you want\nIt's a few quick taps and avoids having to scroll through a list of songs and albums I don't need to see.\n\nA: Another approach is to change the Album name so your album library sorts in a useful way.  I love classical, so I start with composer name, underscore, album.  ie\"Bthvn_Piano Sonatas 8, 14, 23\".  I also like Folk rock and name all those albums \"y_J Collins .....\",  my books on CD (from library for road listening) all are labeled \"ZZ_JP_title\" where JP are the initials of the author.  Lastly, Christmas music starts with a single \"z\".\nprobably over-engineered, but it has worked for me for over 10 years.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 5S with iOS 8.4 have a cellular data addiction? Recently, I've been running out of data each month and it's being bugging me because most of the time my phone is either at home, or at work, where there is WiFi. Surely I can't be using that much cellular data I thought.\nSo I ran a test. Connect my phone to my home WiFi, I reset my cellular data usage statistics to 0 and then dropped into the AppStore to download an app (any app, it didn't matter which). Re-checking my celluar data statistics straight afterwards - 12.3Kb used. My question is why?\nIt's important to note that on my phone cellular data was turned on and I had an E connection at the time. Background app refresh was turned off. During the test, I didn't let the phone lock or go into standby mode, so there shouldn't be an issue with the WiFi going into hot standby. The WiFi was active the whole time (I was using it).\nI know 12Kb isn't a lot but I'm chasing a principle here. My WiFi is on and being actively used - so why is my phone still using its cellular data connection? What else is it doing favours a significantly slower connection?\nCan anyone help me debug / trace this? The best I can find is that \"System services\" is using a small amount of data (0.3Kb), mostly attributed to push notifications, but beyond that I'm stuck.\n\nA: There are a lot of situations in which your phone, while connected via WiFi, might need to make a cellular connection. This would include normal communication with a cell tower, incoming calls, Visual Voicemail, or depending on your WiFi signal and performance, additional data from apps.\nOnce you have reset your cellular data usage statistics, re-run the same test you did. Once complete, go down into Settings -> Cellular  and look at which apps now report data usage. This will help you narrow down which app is causing it, but again there are too many potential answers as to why it is happening.\n", "Q: How to install QuickTime 7 without overwriting the currently installed version I purchased a Intel MacBook Pro from a colleague with installed OS 10.8.5. I do not own the OS disks therefore do not have the disks to re-install QuickTime. QT 10.2 is on this \"new\" 2008 MacBookPro. The question relates to the need to install QT 7 which has the dialog box to register the key code to unlock the Pro features (QT 10.2 lacks the ability to enter the Pro key hence the need to install QT 7 then upgrade). How might I install QT7 and still retain the QT 10.2 version on the MacBook Pro, as I don't have the option of reinstalling 10.2 if written over. (I don't want to risk \"losing\" QT 10.2 on OS 10.8.5 because it will block the ability to use Final Cut Pro 7 or X). Please advise. Thank you.\n\nA: The QuickTime Player 7 and QuickTime 10 apps coexist on all my Macs without causing any problems.\nIf you're worried about overwriting QuickTime Player 10, right-click on the app, and choose Compress \"QuickTime Player.app\" and zip it up. If the QuickTime Player 7 installation wipes out v.10, (and I don't think it will,) then you can simply uncompress it.\nYou can also retrieve it from a Time Machine backup. You do use Time Machine, don't you?\n", "Q: Pages: Change Body Style for Entire document I'm using Pages 5.5.3 on OS X 10.10.4. I can't figure out how to change the size of the Body style for the entire document. If I try to increase the size of the Body text it only changes the size of the text where my cursor was last - the rest of the document is unaffected.\nThank you in advance.\n\n\nA: When you click on the font size selector, an Update button appears beside the style you have selected:\n\nClick on it and the style is updated to the new parameters.

Find command running for 4 days; Disk Utility reports no errors Computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2011 MacBook Pro 13\"\n\n*Factory 500 GB serial ATA (5400 RPM) HDD\n\n\nProblem:\nA few days ago my computer started running extremely slow — could barely perform the most basic functions like typing. \nWhat I've done:\nI ran an Apple hardware test (both the long and short one), but eventually it always froze (and allegedly continued running for hours) at a certain time — but did not say what exactly it was testing.\nI also tried to repair the disk and permissions in Disk Utility via recovery mode, but it found no disk issues (fixed numerous permissions issues though).\nNone of the above helped to resolve.\nTherefore, I tried to copy some of the important folders I was working with (because Time Machine stopped working a few weeks ago) and it wouldn´t let me copy some video files, returning errors.\nAfter reading StackExchange, I ran this SMART Utility and it turns out I have just over 100 bad blocks in my HDD, with 40 000 files corrupted. \nEasy question:\nI am assuming this means that my HDD is dead and I should get a new one?\nFollow-up questions:\nI followed the advice on another question, to enter this into Terminal:\nfind / -type f -print -exec dd if={} of=/dev/null bs=1m \\;\n\nIt has been running for 4 days straight without freezing — but the post above said it should freeze when it hits a bad block. It seems it's been going through all the files in my computer and allocating new space to the bad blocks.\nHow long should I wait for this to finish? \nIs good for this to be running so long? Should I let it finish, or should I not waste time and start setting up a new HDD?\n\nA: In response to your first and easy question, yes, your HDD is dying and needs to be replaced ASAP.  Now is a good opportunity to change it to an SSD.  Here is a good video on YouTube that shows you how.\nI am not sure why you would use dd to fix bad blocks/sectors when DiskUtility has a more robust solution.\nBoot into recovery mode by holding Command-R (or off a CD or USB Key)\nGo into DiskUtility and under the First Aid tab, click \"Verify Disk\"\nYou should get a bunch of errors reported\nClick \"Fix Disk\"\nNow, you aren't fixing the disk per se.  You are marking the bad sectors as unusable so data doesn't get written there.  \nOnce you do this...\nBack up your files to another drive ASAP\n", "Q: Unable to delete a User Account on Yosemite I had a user account of my ex boyfriend installed on my Mac. I want to completely delete it but it has been over a week now that it has been saying \"deleting account..\" under the user name. When I want to restart my mac it won't let me. It just says:\n\nSystem Preferences is busy and can't be closed. Users & Groups preferences is removing a user account and saving the Home directory to a disk image.\n\n\nA: If you want to completely delete it, you should cancel the current process as it is saving the whole user account to a disk image –which is why is taking so long– and restart the account deletion process without saving any data when prompted.\nFrom the Apple Support page:\n\n\n  \n*Select the user you want to delete, then click Remove  below the list of users.\n  \n*Do one of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*(…)\n  \n*(…)\n  \n*Remove the user’s home folder from the computer: Select “Delete the home folder.” The user information will be deleted and the storage\n  space will be freed. If you want to prevent programs that read raw\n  data from retrieving any files, select “Erase home folder securely.”\n  \n  \n\n\nA: As stated by Jaime Santa Cruz, it is taking a long time because it is saving his files to a disk image for backup.  To stop that process, hold down the power button until you computer shuts off.  You will be ok, but don't use this method for every issue you run into.  It's fairly safe, but not foolproof.\nA couple of assumptions here.....\n\n\n*\n\n*He must have had a lot of files.\n\n*You probably don't want them\n\n\nHere is the quick way to solve this issue (I am assuming you have Administrator rights to this Mac)\nUsing Finder, navigate to \n/Users/\nInside that folder you will find a folder structure similar to the following:\nDesktop\nDownloads\nMusic\nPictures\n\nYou may have more folders than that.  Go into each folder and delete everything by moving it to the trash.  Delete all the folders, but leave that structure intact.\nNext, remove the account as you did before.  It should go very quickly now.\nNow, I am not at my mac to confirm, but if I remember correctly, when you try to remove a user account it should present you with a few choices of what to do with the users home folder.  If you don't want his data, you can choose to delete it.\nWhat I described is basically the manual process of deleting the home folder so either method will work.\n", "Q: How to preserve MacbookPro battery from degradation? Platform: OS X: Yosemite 10.10.4; MacbookPro 15\" Retina (mid-2015).\nFact: There is aging for battery in any case - using or not. But while using - there is difference of how to use. My questions - in order to minimize battery degradation: \n\n\n*\n\n*How often should I totally discharge battery ?\n\n*Is degradation rate is a matter of full cycles or it doesn't matter\nto what highest and lowest level I charge or discharge laptop ?\n\n*Most (99%) of the time I am connected to power - which leads to 100%\ncharge level always. But many sites say, like following link:\nhttp://www.runpcrun.com/laptop-battery-use-and-storage-guidelines\nsay, that better to keep battery 40% charged than 100%. How to\nachieve that (there is no ability, as far as I know, to manually\nlimit charging battery level) ?\n\n*Do you have empirical evidences to prove or disapprove this\nexpectations ?\n\n*I ask this since to replace battery in Macbook Pro is hard to be\ndone - many screw types, many modules do disassembly, using glue to\ngrasp components without moving inside. And therefore I prefer doing\nthis rarest I can. How much time (how many years) it typically takes\nupon your experience to get to buttery degradation of 40% capacity\ncompared to Day-1 of using your Macbook Pro ?\n\n*After 2 minutes of laptop using - the internal temperature (CPU,\nRAM, Battery) gets to 85-90 degrees (Celsius) and stays so till I\nturn off (sleep) laptop - for 12 working hours every day. Is there\nsomething I can do about heat (both in general, and regarding\nbattery especially)?\n\n\nWhat else should I do or know to not be frustrated later ? \n\nA: Your battery life is based on age and cycles, not so much what you use them for.  Your battery has no idea if you are streaming music from your favorite service or your are crunching numbers to calculate ∏ to the nth digit or just surfing Stack Exchange.\nThe more draw you put on it, the more it is going to discharge requiring you to plug it back in to recharge it.  Basically, the more you use, the more charging cycles it is going to go through.  Video uses more CPU, so more draw, so more recharging.  Sleeping, virtually no power draw, so less recharging.\nYou can get good info on battery life directly from Apple:  www.apple.com/batteries/\nSo, how do you lengthen the life of your battery?  Reduce the number of cycles it going to need to go through.  Optimizing/Updating your software, turning off services can all help; but only so much.  Paying attention to the ambient temperature and not operating it in extreme conditions definitely helps; but I doubt you are in the Arctic or in the middle of the Sahara so this doesn't apply as much as you would think.  However if that's the case, battery life is not your biggest concern.\nIn the end it comes down to you are going to have to replace your battery.  When is the question and there is no prognostication for that.  If you have work to do, do it.  If you want to watch a video, watch it.  If worrying about the battery is something that you have to do because you can't (or is very difficult to) afford to replace it when it can no longer hold a charge, this is not the device for you.\nSince Apple, Dell, Lenovo all warranty their batteries for a full year and offer extended battery warranty for a relatively small amount, you can probably expect at least 2 years with good performance.  They have already run the numbers and wouldn't warranty something they knew there was a good chance they would have to cover.  Remember, they are betting you won't have to use the warranty service.\nMy advice if this is really a concern is to find out how much battery replacement is and budget for it.\n", "Q: HDMI to VGA with USB-C VGA adaptor on 2015 Retina Macbook I have one of the new Macbooks on the way and have also bought the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter with HDMI to go with it.\nIf I want to get VGA with this adaptor, rather than buying the same adaptor but with VGA, I want to use an HDMI to VGA adaptor such as this one.\nThis adaptor has a USB power in if the HDMI out does not have sufficient power output. Will the Macbook adaptor's HDMI port have sufficient power to make this unnecessary or will I also have to use the adaptor's USB port when using VGA?\n\nA: You won't know until you actually get it and test it.  \nHDMI specs say you should get 5v at 50mA.  That's not much to start with.\nYou can read about this more from here.  You could get more power but it would have to have MHL (mobile high definition link) support.  That will be able to give you up to 40 watts.\nNow, I looked on the Apple site and it appears that the Adapter you selected isn't very highly rated.  I have rarely had success with genuine Apple adapters and instead had to rely on 3rd party adapters to get a reliable results.\nYou may want to save yourself the headache and just get the VGA adapter and be done with it.\n\nA: I just tested the proposed setup: It does not work the VGA monitor stays black.\nI have the Macbook 12Inch 8,2 early 2015 and the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter with HDMI. Naively I bought an HDMI--VGA converter (ICYBOX HDMItoVGADOngle) and connected it to the HDMI -- no success. \nApple wants me to buy a second 90EUR adapter when I want to make a beamer presentation with this mobile notebook. \n", "Q: Merging or combining two iOS backups In May of 2015 my iPad Mini died because it got wet.

I'm using Mac 10.9.5.  When I run a terminal with multiple tabs (using bash shell), I've noticed that when my computer restarts, the terminal will open up with the same number of tabs that were open in the previous session, but the commands I was running in the previous session (accessible via the \"history\" shell command) are no longer present in each tab.\nIs there a way to preserve each session's history in the appropriate tab between computer restarts?\n\nA: Try adding this to ~/.bash_profile:\nHISTFILE=~/.bash_history.$(basename $(tty))\n\nThis creates a unique history file for the terminal associated with each tab.\n\nA: The command history is saved by the shell when it closes, and by default this goes into ~/.bash_history.\nSo as the shell in each of your tabs is closed, they each append their own command history to that file.  When new shells/tabs are opened, they will load that file for their history.\nSo in a sense, each tab's history is saved, and you should be able to use ctrl-R to search for it (within limits of the history size limit), but when reloaded, each tab will see all the history, and in blocks corresponding to the order the previous tabs happened to close.\nYou might be able to configure the bash history more to your liking.\n", "Q: How can I disable the \"no backup in x days\" from TimeMachine? (Updated answer choice for High Sierra. See the old answer if you are still on Yosemite)\nI'm running OS X Yosemite, and I want to disable the notifications from Time Machine.

Time Machine is not in the Notifications preferences, and I don't want to stop using it entirely. \n\nA: When you don't have the external hard drive hooked up, go System Preferences >> Time Machine, and switch it to OFF. You will still be able to perform backups, it just won't happen automatically.\nIn newer OS versions, you must uncheck the Back up automatically box and then right-click on the backup disk on the right side and select Stop using ‘Time Machine’ Backups.\nThis is the technique that I use, and I don't see notifications.\n\nA: As mentioned previously, the process to disable these notifications has slightly changed as of High Sierra.\nI'm on 10.13.2 and here's the process that I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*After unchecking Back Up Automatically in the System\nPreferences > Time Machine section, I was still receiving the\nmessages. \n\n*I also went ahead and removed my old backup device from\nSelect Backup Disk... and then the warnings have stopped coming up (fingers crossed).\n\n", "Q: How to mount and name a volume if it's not already mounted with a startup script I'm trying to do something I thought would be simple, but after researching it I feel like I'm half way towards shaving a yak, so I'm asking for advice. I want to create a script that lets me and my colleagues do normal spolight searches on a shared drive, which from research seems to not be easy and is best solved with a script that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Runs on startup (it sounds like the simplest way to do this is to make shell scripts launch on startup using Automator)\n\n*Checks if a volume of a certain name is mounted (a directory on an smb shared drive on an active directory Windows-based shared company drive)\n\n*If it's not, mounts it to that specific name\n\n*Then, index it in spotlight, using its volume name. I think I've got this part covered: mdutil /Volumes/name -i on, apparently\nThe bolded parts are the parts I'm having trouble with.\n\nParticular problems I'm having:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've found an AppleScript way to mount a drive if it's not already mounted - check name of every disk then mount volume \"path://to/volume\" - but it doesn't allow me to specify the name, and I'm cautious about how consistent the Mac will auto-name a path on a non-Mac shared drive. I want to set the volume name so I can refer to it when telling Spotlight which volume to index, which seems to be impossible in AppleScript?\n\n*I've found a shell script way to mount a drive to a specific volume, but I read (can't find the source now, am looking for it) that the volume has to already exist, which confuses me (do I need to create an empty volume? I don't quite understand what an empty volume would be); and I can't see how to check that it hasn't already auto-mounted.\n\n\nMy level of knowledge of Mac volumes etc is quite low, so I'm aware I may have misunderstood any of the above. \n\nA: OS X follows these steps when mounting a drive: It creates a raw device in /dev/ (for local disks only), it creates a folder in /Volumes/, then it mounts the drive to that folder it just created. That folder creation step is probably what you read. The shell script you linked is missing the following command:\nmkdir /Volumes/somenetworkdir\n\nThen the command you linked will work, with the proper parameters\nmount -t smbfs -o username=RemoteUser //REMOTEHOST/directory /Volumes/somenetworkdir\n\n\nA: set mountedVolumes to do shell script \"ls /Volumes/\"\n\nif (mountedVolumes contains \"thisDriveName\") is false then\n\n        mount volume \"afp://thisUsername:thisPassword@thisIPorHostname/thisDriveName\"\n\nend if\n\n\nA: You can check if a volume is mounted by checking the output  of the mountcommand:\nmount | grep '/Volumes/SomeVolumeName'\n\nAnd you can mount it with open smb://.... So your script could look something like this\n#!/bin/bash\n\nserver=my_server\nshare=SomeShare\nuser=my_username\npass=y_password\n\n# ...\n\nmount | grep -q \"/Volumes/$share \" || open smb://$user:$pass@$server/$share\n\n# ...\n\nThe open smb://... command will mount it under the name of the share.\n", "Q: How can I E-mail multiple photos ?

What's the point of promo code if your app is already ready for release anyways?\nFor example if you want to give your app to iOS review sites is it better to give them a promo code before you put app in App Store or just let them download the app for review from App store?\n\nA: Apple documents them quite extensively. Feel free to ask a more specific follow on question once you have read the documentation. \nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ProvidingPromoCodes.html\nOne awesome advantage of them is that you can seed pre-release versions of an app by controlling the use of codes and release dates once specific versions of your app have been approved for sale. \n", "Q: Why am I getting an error \"No Index\" when I try to CREATE a spotlight index with mdutil? I'm trying to create a spolight index of a directory on a shared drive (a corporate Windows active directory drive) using mdutil following the simple guide here.

You can read more about the command by typing man mdutil into the terminal. An excerpt:\n\n-i on | off:\n  Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note that indexing may be delayed due to low disk space or other conditions.\n\nAlso, indexing won't work on a drive mounted with SMB.

However I would really like to preserve some of my favorites. \nAre there any easy ways of doing this on iOS8?\n\nA: I know this is old, but I’ve just found a good way to do this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Favourites folder, and select them all. \n\n*Click “duplicate”. This will create duplicates, all of which will then appear at the end of your Camera roll. \n\n*Select all the files before the duplicate copies on camera roll and delete them. \n\n\nA: I don't think there is a solution to your problem in the way you've asked:\nHowever you could download and delete all the photos off your phone into iPhoto on your Mac, then create an album of photos/videos you want to put back on the phone and sync that back using iTunes.\n\nA: If you are an iOS developer, you can always write a quick app. Otherwise, they're a few apps that might do what you need.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purrge\nYeah, I did spell that right, This will let you swipe to select all the photos you don't want and delete them, you can click on a photo to see it in full screen.\n\n\n*Flic\nFlic is a simple app in which you just swipe to keep or delete photos\n\n\n*Bulk Delete\nThis is like Purrge but supports photo AND video\n\n\nIf you use iCloud photo library, you could upload all your photos to that. From there, it will mark your favorites with a star so you can quickly go over them.\n\nAnother option is you can put all your photos in an album. Then in that album, take out all the pictures you don't like. Then you can delete all the photos in that album at one\n\nA: To free up space on my phone, while maintaining my favorites I do the following:\nYour \"recently Deleted\" folder stores items in the order that they were deleted. \n1st: Go to favorites folder (or whatever folder that contains photos/videos that you want to keep) Select all and then press the trash (delete) icon. Those photos will now be in one group in the \"recently deleted\" folder. \n2nd: Go to your main photo album \"Camera Roll\" select all the photos and delete. \n3rd: Go to recently deleted folder, you will find your \"favorites\" are all still bunched in a group together. Select those and restore.\n4th: Now go back to recently deleted folder and permenantly delete all the contents. This will free up the space on your phone and you still have your favorites. \nNote: I use dropbox to back up all my photos so I never worry too much about deleting any, but there are those \"favorites\" that I like to keep to have quickly at hand to show to others. I make sure my drop box is synced and up to date before doing the above process that way I don't have to worry too much about accidentally deleting something I'll want later. Amazon prime has unlimited photo storage so that's where I eventually dump all my photos. \n\nA: You can use iCloud Photo Sharing to keep only selected photos on your iPhone while deleting all photos in Camera Roll.\nHow: enable iCloud Photo Sharing, in \"Shared\", create a new shared album, say \"Favorites Forever\". Share this album to yourself (you can of course share this to others too, but let's assume you want to keep this folder for your eyes only). Import existing photos from \"Albums/Favorites\" into \"Favorites Forever\". When the importing is complete, you can now delete ALL the photos in Camera Roll. All the photos that used to be stored in Camera Roll and displayed in \"Albums/Favorites\" will be gone. However, you still have the original copies of all of them in \"Shared/Favorites Forever\".\nEssentially, you use iCloud Photo Sharing to create a folder to replace the default \"Albums/Favorites\". Albums in iCloud Photo Sharing are stored separately from \"Albums/Camera Roll\" - that's why this solution is possible.\n\nA: A user on the MacRumors forum has built an app to do exactly this task, find and delete all photos in a folder or in the camera roll that have not been marked as a favorite.\nThe app is \"Deleter\" by saleksandras and it's at: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deleter/id1180101544?ls=1&mt=8\nI just ran the app, and it worked perfectly!  It selected the 2,600 photos on my phone that I hadn't marked as favorites and ignored the 600 that I had favorited.  When I hit delete, it moved all of the non-favorites from my camera roll to the recently deleted folder (so I could recover them for 30 days if I needed to).  It took a minute or so to delete everything, but it was 9gb of photos, so I think it can be excused for that :)\nIt was a bit nerve-wracking to hit delete on that many photos, but I had already backed up my camera roll to my PC using the PhotoSync app (another great tool), so I wasn't really worried.\nI don't know why Apple doesn't include a mass-selection tool to easily select all favorite or non-favorite photos, but this app does the job!\n\nA: I might have found a workaround. It's not pretty, but might work. \n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, go to your favorites album, select all, and move them to trash.\n\n*Connect your phone to a computer and navigate to the directory that contains your library of photos.\n\n*Select all and delete.\n\n*Disconnect from the computer.\n\n*Restore all photos from your phones trash.\n\n\nThis SHOULD leave you with just your favorites.\nIt's a shame this isn't easier. Maybe there's a better way?\n\nA: AirDrop your favorite photos to your friend's iPhone. Delete everything, then AirDrop it back to your phone. Easiest, fastest way to do it if we're talking about large amount of photos. \n\nA: That's a good suggestion to use your computer.   As you're using iOS8 you just need to make sure 'iCloud Photo Library' is enabled, then all your photos will be synced to the Photos for Mac app.  Then you can locate your favourites in Albums > Favourites, select all, and export them somewhere on your disk.  Then go to Albums > All Photos, select all and delete everything.  Then you can re-import your saved favourites.  Depending how many photos you have this may not be practical, considering the syncing.\n\nA: Inspired by one of the answers here, I went to my favorites album and use the \"hide\" feature which then keeps those images from showing in my Moments, Collections, and Years\" folders. I then go to one of those folders - i chose Moments and deleted the remaining images from today's photo session, and then went back to my Favorites folder and \"unhid\" the images.\n\nA: You do not tell us whether you use Windows or OS X. If it's the latter, open Photos and click the \"heart\" icon for your favorite photos.\nThen open iTunes, click on the device icon, select 'Photos' from the left tab, and select the checkbox \"Favorites\".\n\nThe new selections will start syncing once you press \"Apply\".\nYou do not need to go through iCloud.\n", "Q: Moving from Stanza to another eBook reader on my iPad Air For years, I've been reading ebooks on my antique iPhone 4, using Calibre to painlessly send ebooks to it.\nI have an iPad Air, and it just dawned on me (I guess I'm slow) that I oughtta be doing my reading on my iPad Air. Stanza's out of the question, obviously, but I like the effortless way Calibre maintains my vast library. I also like the ease with which Stanza works (though not the frequent crashes on the phone, obviously).\nI'd be grateful if someone would recommend an eBook app which will continue to work with Calibre. I've tried over the years to replace Stanza with appalling results, and I'd rather not go through the agony of buying eBook readers only to throw my money away on disappointments (or worse, apps which make me rage). I'm a disabled vet and can't afford to go experimenting in things I can't use.\nIf you can tell me which app will work for me right out of the gate, I'll be a happy girl. These are my requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lets Calibre maintain my library and add books to/remove books from my eBook app's library;\n\n*Allows me to read ebooks easily.\n\n*(Optional) Allows to me change size and typeface of text easily, although this is an option I really, really want.\n\nA: MegaReader will do all that you've asked for here. It's not free, but it's not very expensive. It's what I replaced Stanza with on my own iPhone.\n\nA: I think I will use Marvin (there is a trial free version) when I can't restore Stanza from the backup. (I recently had to reset my phone and reinstalled Stanza even though it is not in the AppStore any more) I did try Marvin as my reader but went back to Stanza\nMarvin used to have a direct interface to Calibre via a plugin see support forum which allowed direct control in calibre of what is on the iPhone.\n Marvin also can load books over OPDS as does Stanza\nIt is more configurable than Stanza and so can be made to work in a similar way - except the font setting is per book and not global. Also Marvin page refreshes can be seen, Stanza just does the refresh all at once\nI have now upgraded to a new phone and Stanza still works but only shows the old screen size, it still works better but the extra size means I have moved to Marvin and reverted back Stanza gets the width OK but not all the height but is just much better.\nAnd IOS 10 has killed Stanza the next page function now does to the start of the next chapter :(\n", "Q: Can I backup or mirror an IMAP mailbox on Mac OS X?

It's now totally off and wont turn back on!\nAside from cleaning it and keeping it in rice, is there any other way to fix it? Or is it just gone?\nIt's out of warranty.\n\nA: I answered a similar question (probably a duplicate?) here: iPhone 6 water damage dark screen issue\nThere is a good post about using various methods such as silica, Damp-Rid, kitty litter and other products that work much better than rice.\nAn excerpt from that answer: Try the rice thing for a few days, you have nothing to lose at this point. When I used to take calls for AppleCare I had several customers tell me this worked, the idea being the rice would suck the water out. I don't believe it's really a great idea but it can't hurt at this point.\nHaving said that, your phone is pretty much toast, per the other answer. When I was lent out to the Apple store, we saw Macbooks and phones come in where the customer said they had \"dried it out\" but \"it wasn't working\" a few weeks later.\nInvariably we'd open the thing up and see some residual water in there.\nSorry to say, you are probably on the road to a new phone. :( Now if you try a third-party place to repair it, at least the last time I worked for Apple about a year ago, if you put third-party parts in there Apple will never touch it to do a repair. Unlike Macs where you don't \"void the warranty,\" any third party parts in an iOS device precludes Apple from doing any repairs in the future.\nSo balance out free (rice) vs. third-party screen (cheaper) vs. shiny new iPhone 6S!!\nNOTE: Apple has an out of warranty replacement program but it's not a sure thing they'll apply it to a wet phone.\n", "Q: Delete all music from iPhone How do I delete all music from an iPhone 5?\nIt got loaded from my computer without me checking the box.\nI tried to follow the directions from one search result with no success. \n\nA: If you are on iOS 8, you can go to Settings > General > Usage > Storage > Manage Storage > Music, slide the first item \"All Songs\" to the left and press \"Delete\". \n\n\nWarning: there is no confirmation dialog, as I've just found out :|\n\nA: If the music is purchased from iTunes Store: You can either swipe right and click delete and/or go to Settings>Music> Turn off Show All Music.

Quite a complicated process, but works quite well.\n", "Q: How do I use cmd+1 as a keyboard shortcut? cmd+2, cmd+3, etc, work In Preferences > Profiles > Keys\nI've mapped cmd+1 through cmd+9 but cmd+1 alone does not respond.\nDoes anyone else have this issue?\nThis is for the latest iterm2, v2.1.1 and several earlier versions as well; it has never worked for me.\n\nA: The problem is that iterm2 uses cmd+1, cmd+2 ... etc for switching between tabs by default. As long as you have first tab, cmd+1 is binded to switch to the this tab.\nWorkaround is to change Keys -> Navigation shortcuts -> To switch tabs: value to alt or any other except cmd.\n\nA: I haven't used iTerm but it sounds like the cmd+1 might be used somewhere else in your system. Try looking inside System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and look around to see if the shortcut you want to use is already taken by the system or another application.\n\nA: If you look at the OS X Keyboard Shortcuts, you will see that the keystroke Command-1 through 4 are already assigned to finder which means 5 through 9 are available for mapping.\nAnd speaking of which...OS X once allowed you to create your own mappings and that feature seems to have been conveniently removed.  I reccomend taking a look at Karabiner  which will not only allow you to remap your keys, but also change all the related settings.  Karabiner should allow you to change the mappings of Command-1 through 4 as well.\n\nA: iTerm2 → Preferences → key → Navigation Shortcuts → To switch split panes.\nReplace it with other keys, then ⌘ cmd 1 will work.\n", "Q: Apple IOS update 8.4 question I recently updated my iphone to ios 8.4  How do I shuffle my offline music the way I used to before the update ?\n\nA: I don't know how you used to shuffle your music before, but apparently there is a way to restore the 'shuffle all songs' functionality present on earlier versions, if that is what you mean:\nhttp://ios.wonderhowto.com/how-to/shuffle-all-songs-apples-new-music-app-ios-8-4-0162796/\n(EDIT: The two methods in that page are:\n\n\n*\n\n*While a song is playing, use Siri and say \"shuffle songs\".\n\n*Create a 'smart playlist' containing all your stuff, because you can still shuffle within a playlist.\n\n\n)\n", "Q: Do iphones require a carrier plan? I am currently looking to purchase a used iphone4s solely for testing apps. I was wondering if there are any service requirements like \"you must have a service plan or the device will not operate\". I just want to sideload apps for debugging.\n\nA: If an iPhone does not have a SIM card, it will work with WiFi.\nHowever, if the iPhone is locked to a specific carrier, you can only activate it by plugging in a valid SIM card for that carrier. Once activated, the iPhone will be usable without a SIM card.\nIn the US (I am assuming you are in the US), most iPhones are sold as being locked to a carrier, and unlocked iPhones are rare. Outside the US, unlocked iPhones are more common.\n", "Q: App cellular settings lost when toggling Airplane mode On iOS 8.4 on iPhone 5s, I noticed that if I set Cellular > App Store > Off, kill Setting app, then activate Airplane Mode, deactivate Airplane Mode, launch Settings, Cellular > App Store  is now On (Green).   Toggling Airplane mode flipped the setting.  This is true for a number of Apple apps.

Besides being annoying, it got me thinking - What could cause this?\n\nA: Pure guess, but …\nThe geomapping for the local WiFi connections is incorrect.\nSomebody recently moved house & took their router with them, or bought one from someone else, etc, etc & the locations database has not been updated to reflect this.  \nFind my iPhone relies on already 'knowing' the position of all available WiFi APs [irrespective of whether or not it can or has ever connected to them] to triangulate the current location.\nSee How Google-and everyone else-gets Wi-Fi location data for a background story.\n& HT5467 Updating WiFi router location in Apple's database? for some ramblings on what happens when the database doesn't get updated.\nAs far as a guess on why two different people had the same issue, that has me stumped, unless the 'owner' of the out-of-position WiFi is also the source of the vanishing phones.\n", "Q: Can i use my ipad adapter cube and a usb cord together without any damage to the phone? Is using the two together going to damage my phone in any way?\n\nA: The short answer is that any USB charger is safe with any USB device; a smaller (iPhone) charger may not charge a bigger (iPad) device. You can also connect your device via a USB extension cable.\nThe longer version is that Apple's USB chargers (whether sold with the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Apple Watch, or new MacBook) are all essentially the same, the difference is how much electrical current they can supply. The chargers are all regulated (meaning they incorporate circuitry to maintain a constant voltage), which means the connected device will simply draw as much current as it needs and no more.\nThis means you can easily charge a lesser device with a greater charger; a MacBook (the new USB-C MacBook, not the older MagSafe models!) charger will quite safely charge an iPhone, as will an iPad charger. (You will, of course, need a USB-C to USB adapter, as the charger has a USB-C port and Apple doesn't yet make USB-C lightning cables.)\nYou can also charge a greater device with a lesser charger, though charging will be slower. An iPad will work with an iPhone charger, but will charge much more slowly, or not at all. An iPhone charger will not damage the new MacBook, but it also probably won't supply enough power for it to run, let alone charge.\nYou can also connect the device to the charger with a USB extension cable (though not a hub!), but I'd recommend not exceeding 5 m total cable length (from the USB port on the charger, to the port on your device).\nOther USB devices can also be powered or charged with an Apple USB charger; I often use my iPhone chargers to charge my 3G WiFi modem, charge Bluetooth headphones, and run a Raspberry Pi.\n\nA: No, its not going to damage anything - the iPad and iPhone have the same value of charging.\nYou can use your iPad adapter cube and an USB cable with your iPhone. \nIt will charge your phone the same way your iPhone charger does.\n\nA: The short answer is: It's debatable. It will not immediately damage your phone, but may decrease long term battery life.\nApple has not officially commented on this, (to my knowledge) however it is commonly accepted that routinely charging a battery with higher amperage than it's designed to take will degrade performance over time. Yet, even that is debated. \nHow much performance in what time period is not officially known, as consumer smart phones are replaced well before the true limits of the hardware.\nFurthermore, anecdotal evidence found online is often along the lines of \"I used my iPad charger for 11 months before replacing my iPhone with a newer model\" don't really answer the question, although they may for individual purposes.\nHere is an article explaining battery basics:\nhttp://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a3224/can-you-use-the-same-power-adapter-for-iphone-and-ipad-10283982/\nHere is a Reddit discussion with some great information:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1uh2zj/is_it_safe_to_use_an_ipad_charger_to_charge/\n\nA: It will not immediately damage your phone, but may decrease long term battery life.\nIt will not decrease long term battery life. It may charge a bit faster, which is good for actual generation Li-ion batteries.\nWhat is bad for batteries is letting them discharge completely without charging.\nLexS\n\nA: Not only will it not damage your phone but can potentially charge it faster if you own certain iPhones. \nhttp://lifehacker.com/use-an-ipad-power-adapter-to-charge-your-iphone-6-faste-1637676153\n", "Q: Excel 14.4.7 - Issue saving \"read only\" excel spread sheets When I save “read only” spread sheets that I receive as attachments, excel doesn’t save them as their original name.

This problem is especially frustrating when we have a specific name that may be long due to the complexity of the project.\nis there something I can do to solve this?\n\nA: There is a pop up question for you to answer when opening the \"read only\" file from email attachment.\n\nYou have to select \"No\" as answer if you plan to modify and save in the \"original\" name.\nIf you answer \"Yes\" it will change the file name when saving.\n\nA: As far as I know the problem is occuring when you do double-click an attachment. Outlook saves attachments in a special folder which is read-only for the user (for what reason ever).

I have a team of a few Mac users in an organisation of about a thousand PC users, all of whom share an Active Directory shared drive which the Mac users connect to with smb.\nThere's one folder with a few thousand files in many subfolders that the Mac users need to be able to search. I've tried to index it directly and to mount the folder as a volume then index it, but in both cases the standard way seems to not work with folders.\nIndexing the whole drive is not an option - It's insanely huge and already has performance issues. Installing smaller physical drives or partitions isn't an option.\nHow can I index just one shared folder (and its sub folders)?\n\nI've found some vague allusions to mdimport and mdimport -f instead of mdutil (example) but I can't find any clear info on it.\n\nA: I'm not sure you can index a single folder in quite that way. Indexing starts at drive level…\nBut how about the other way round?\nTell it to index the drive, then add everything else to Private?\nExclusive rather than inclusive method.\nYou can do that at the server by adding a file called .metadata_never_index at the top level of each other directory, rather than have to do it at each user's machine from the Spotlight control panel.\n", "Q: How can I print in colour from mac book air when olivetti printer defaults is set to print mono We have just one Mac user in the office.

Our Olivetti MF2400 is set to print in mono which is fine for HP users as we can choose colour from the file drop down however, there does not seem to be such an option on the mac book air. \nAny advice? \nThanks\nG \n\nA: For this answer, I am assuming that you are using a relatively newer version of OS X on your Mac and at least Windows 7 for the HP Pros.\nThis is a driver issue.  The only thing that can override a default value is a user setting on a driver.  I went to the Olivetti MF 2400 support site and found these drivers:\n\nIf you notice, there are two MacOSX drivers that are \"PS Mono;\"  that's Post Script Monochrome.  I suspect you are using one of those drivers.  Try downloading and using the \"PS\" version of the driver (the second one being that it is for 10.6 which is the version of OS X that only supported the Intel CPU and not the PowerPC.\nThat said, this is a discontinued printer and finding drivers may become much more difficult as time progresses.  You may be able to extend its useful life by sharing this printer (via CUPS in Linux/Unix) and emulating something a bit more generic like an HP Color Jet.  It's not the cleanest solution, but if you just want basic color printing, it will probably get the job done.\n", "Q: Why do I get a \"This photo is not editable\" message in iOS 8?

I'm using an iPhone with iOS 8.4, and a Mac with Yosemite using the Photos app and syncing with iTunes. iCloud Photo Library is turned off on both the Mac and the iPhone.\nAfter syncing with iTunes there are photos on the iPhone that should not be there; they are not included in the \"selected albums\" list in iTunes. Some of them are no longer in my Photos library (on the Mac) at all. But after many syncs they still appear on the iPhone.\nWhen I look at the offending photos there is no trash can icon (like there would be if they were in the Camera Roll), and tapping the Edit button brings up the message \"This photo is not editable\".\nHow can I delete these rogue photos? An ideal solution would be one that actually \"syncs\" my phone to the selected albums list in iTunes (ie. removing any photos that aren't in that list). But a way to manually delete photos would also be appreciated.\nEdit: None of the photos in question were ever shared with iCloud sharing. They do not appear in any Shared Albums, and turning off iCloud sharing has no effect.\n\nA: The only way that I have been able to delete photos that didn't have the trash can icon is with an app called Cleen.  Available from the Apple app store. I don't remember if it was free or not.  Once downloaded, pull the app up and you will see all your photo albums listed.  Click on the album that contains the photos you want to delete, which is probably the All Photos album.  When the next screen pops up, you will see the first photo in that album in the center of the screen.  Then you will see a little row of blank squares going across the top and bottom.  All you have to do is swipe the photo shown up, if you want to keep it, or swipe it down, if you want to trash it.  Keep going through the album until you get to the photos that you want to delete.  (Just in case you have some photos that you are not sure if you want to keep or delete, you can swipe them to the left and decide on them later)  Once you get those photos that you want deleted in the bottom row, hit the trash can.  The next screen will show you all the photos that are being deleted and if all is okay, hit Delete at top right.  Then a message will pop up saying \"Allow Cleen to delete photo from album\" and then you click Delete All.  It sounds like a lot, but it is really easy.  Doesn't take hardly no time.  I hope this helps you.  This is the only way that I have been able to delete photos when there was no trash can option available.\n\nA: I found this article in Apple's support documents: Delete photos and video synced from iTunes when you can’t access the originals. It also works as a generic solution for deleting all photos on an iOS device and syncing from scratch.\nTo paraphrase, the solution is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new empty folder on your computer and put any one photo\nin.\n\n*In iTunes, go to the tab for syncing photos and select that folder as the source.\n\n*Sync your phone. All photos will be deleted except the camera roll and the 1 photo in your folder.\n\n*Go back to the photo sync tab and restore your previous settings.\n\n*Sync again.\n\n\nThis seems to work for me. It's hard to believe there isn't a better solution though.\n\nA: If iCloud Photo Sharing is on, you may have pictures from other people in a Shared Album you joined, which you won't be able to delete or modify directly.

Just create one first (you can find the exact instructions re how to create an iTunes account for a different country, even if you don't have a credit card from that country), then log off from the account that gives you problems, log on to the other account and you will see your 'explicit' contents right away - even if it's been purchased on your 'restricted country' account.\nJust make sure you've got your 'restricted content' locally, on the computer you sync your iPod/iPhone with.\n\nA: None of the previous answers worked for me on iOS 15.\nWhat I had to do was to download the iTunes Store App, search for an explicit song which will be greyed out and tap it. A pop-up will appear prompting to allow or not allow \"explicit\" content. I tapped Allow and then, in the Music app, all my explicit songs reappeared.\n\nA: Turn off your restrictions, that worked for me\n", "Q: Disk Drive Partition: Single vs Multiple Just for my curiosity and knowledge, from a Software and Hardware stand point prospective, what are the pros and cons of creating 2 (two) partition and saving OS X + Applications on one partition and Users Folders Data on the second partition, vice versa doing the traditional way and use the standard single partition?  What are the benefits?\nThank you so much and have a wonderful day.\n\nA: If you are comfortable using Terminal.app, I recommend multiple partitions.\nMoving Home\nThese questions explain how to move a user account to a separate partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a safe way to move the /Users folder to a separate volume/drive?\n\n*How to make the Users Directory a different partition in Snow Leopard?\nConsiderations, Benefits, and Choices\nHardware\nIt is difficult to justify the choice based solely on the impact to the storage hardware.\nIf the same content is spread across one or more partitions – but always on a single physical drive – then the hardware impact is largely be irrelevant.\nRoughly the same number of read and writes will be performed on the physical drive either way.\nSoftware\nFrom a software perspective, there are benefits to separating mostly static content from your frequently changing content.\nOS X and your applications will largely remain static. They will be read many times but rarely changed.\nYour user files will be likely be read and written frequently.\nApplications\nWell behaved applications will continue to just work. A consumer Mac application that requires a single partition should be considered faulty.\nSome applications will write content within the /Library/ folder on the OS X partition. This content is likely to be caches and content shared across multiple users. It should never be content specific to a single user.\nSmarter Back Ups\nWith separate partitions, you could choose to only back up your user files with Time Machine. If you back up drive is small, you could choose not to back up OS X and your applications.\nIn case of a disaster, your own files would be safe but you would need to download and re-install OS X. Services like BackBlaze take this approach; only user files are backed up.\nEasier Clean Updates\nAs a developer, I have OS X on a separate partition to my files. This has historically made it easier to test with multiple versions of OS X. It has made blanking and re-installing a clean copy of OS X possible.\nEncryption / FileVault2\nYou can choose to encrypt all, some, one, or none of the partitions using the full disk encryption built-into OS X, FileVault.\nIf you only have one partition, the choice becomes encrypting nothing or everything.\nCreate a Fallback User\nIf you decide to move your user area off the OS X partition, I recommend creating a second administrator user account on the OS X partition. This back up account will be useful in case of future problems. If your other partitions do not mount, or you need to demonstrate the computer works but without decrypting your personal files, this fallback administrator account can be helpful.\nThe \"Right\" Partition Sizes\nThe difficult choice to make with multiple partitions, is how large each partition should be? This will depend on your applications.\nIn general try and leave 10 – 20% of your OS X partition free. This will allow for caches and other temporary files to be created, grow, and shrink while the computer is running.\nAn approach might be to determine how much you can safely back up and version. Then pick sizes based around that figure. Better to live frugally but be well backed up, than risk losing irreplaceable personal files.\n\nA: I do not see any advantages to your proposal. On OS X if your Users partition failed to mount then the operating system would create a new home folder for any user who logged in on the boot partition. There may be an advantage to create an application swap partition if any of your apps allow the configuration. \n", "Q: AppStore Checking for updates.. consuming massive amounts of memory Is this normal?

Now I want to use the time machine from Mac A, erase everything from Mac B and initiate Mac B anew with the time machine from Mac A so as to have two identical computers.\nIs that a problem?\n\nA: In theory no it's not a problem but you'd be better off using SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner to make an identical clone using Target Disk Mode over FireWire or Thunderbolt.\nAlso Apple has a built in app for migrating data via FireWire, Thunderbolt and Ethernet, even Wi-Fi if you want to wait!\nThe migration option is given after a fresh OS install, so if you are trying to get a clone these options would be a better bet than making a Time Machine back up then restoring from it, importantly the option for the Migration Assistant is actually in the same list of options at restoring from a Time Machine backup after a fresh OS install.\n", "Q: iphone - is the hotspot isolated (can you see other devices)? When I turn on the Apple hotspot feature, is it an isolated network, or can I see other devices on it?\nCan I use it to connect a third device to a Chromecast?\nAs in tablet -> iPhone with hotspot (and cellular data off) -> Chromecast?\nI want to use a Chromecast while on holiday!\n\nA: Personal Hotspot is designed for sharing a cellular data connection, not for acting as a wireless access point or router. This means that multiple devices connected to the same iOS device cannot connect to one another - they can only access the Internet (assuming the cellular data connection is active). Unfortunately I can't find any Apple documentation to confirm this, but have seent his from personal experience.\nYour best solution is to purchase a portable wireless access point and connect all of your devices to that.\nHootoo makes a dependable and well supported line of travel routers starting at $20.

What's the best way to rebuild the icudt51l.dat file in /usr/share/icu/? ICU (International Components for Unicode) is a set of C/C++ and Java libraries I think, that seem integral to OS X as built-in apps as well as apps using vital system services refuse to work properly or crash after this file got accidentally deleted. I'm attempting to retrieve it, but as this is on a system drive getting it back might not be possible.\n\nA: Another solution for this is to boot into your recovery partition with CMD+R while your machine is booting. From there you can open the Terminal from Utilities in the menu bar. Then you can copy the file with:\ncp /usr/share/icu/icudt51l.dat /Volumes/YOUR_DRIVE/usr/share/icu\n\nIf your drive has FileVault enabled you may have to unlock that through disk utility first.\n\nA: In Terminal with developer tools installed I ran the commands:\ncurl -O http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/51.2/icu4c-51_2-src.tgz\ntar xvf icu4c-51_2-src.tgz\ncd icu/source\nrm -rf data\n./runConfigureICU MacOSX --with-data-packaging=archive\nmake\n\nand from data/out I copied icudt51l.dat to /usr/share/icu/. \nApps now seem to run fine again, but it would seem some caches got deleted.\n\nA: Just reinstall Mac OS X 10.9.5 Combo Updater.

It doesn't copy over entirely: photos and thumbnails are missing among other things.  \nI believe the that having different versions of OS X may be the cause of this. \nWhat can I do to correctly migrate my pictures?\n\nA: OS X 10.10.3 introduced the Photos app, which replaces iPhoto.\nYou have to copy your old iPhoto library and migrate it to the new Photos app, not just move it to the Pictures folder.\nCheck your iPhoto version on the iMac, if it is older than 8.0 (<=7.0) you have to use the iPhoto Library Upgrader\nIf not, or after upgrading it, you can follow Apple's instructions:\n\nTo migrate another photo library manually:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Photos.\n  \n*Hold down the Option key and open Photos.\n  \n*Select the library you want to open.\n  \n*If the library you want isn’t listed, click Other Library.

One with the GUI, the other with:\n$ zip -r alpha_cmd.zip Alpha\n\nThe Alpha directory is 33.640 MB with 164 items.\nThe ZIP file created by the GUI is 2,100 bytes larger than the ZIP file created on the command line.\nWhy is the ZIP file created with the GUI larger?\nNote: Even though the ZIP files have different sizes, when unzipped, each's directory has the exact same number of bytes. Basically, I'm very wary of possible inconsistencies introduced by managing my file system with the GUI and with shell commands.\n\nA: Even apart from the main cause in this case (Finder adding extra hidden stuff, as empedocle says), different sizes for ZIPs of the same data doesn't indicate a problem, when the size difference is a fraction of a percent.\nDifferent ZIP implementations might have a different default compression level (tradeoff between CPU time and size saved), or just have different code that saves more or fewer matches, saving more or fewer bytes at the default compression level.\nFor example, 7-Zip usually makes smaller .zip files than other ZIP programs. (And no, I'm not talking about its own .7z file format. It has a better plain-ZIP compressor, too.)\nzipcmp is a cmdline program that can compare ZIP files. It defaults to comparing just the ZIP directory, to check that all files are the same name, size, and CRC. If this is the case, both ZIP files are almost certain to have the same contents, but just compressed differently (if the compressed size differs.) As long as the ZIP files aren't damaged, of course. Use unzip -t foo.zip to test a ZIP file for decompression errors, non-matching CRCs, etc.\n\nA: Zipping from the Finder adds a folder __MACOSX, invisible on Macs, that contains OS X resource forks like custom icons and such. From Wikipedia:\n\nThe resource fork is a fork or section of a file on the Apple Mac OS operating system used to store structured data along with the unstructured data stored within the data fork. A resource fork stores information in a specific form, containing details such as icon bitmaps, the shapes of windows, definitions of menus and their contents, and application code (machine code). For example, a word processing file might store its text in the data fork, while storing any embedded images in the same file's resource fork. The resource fork is used mostly by executables, but every file is able to have a resource fork.\n\n", "Q: How do I use a numerical variable and a loop in automator?

I'm about to repair a broken screen for iPhone 5S at a non-official repair shop (as official repairs don't provide screen replacement in my region, only replace the whole phone for a fee).\nHow can I check that the replacement part is a genuine one made by Apple (no matter new or extracted from a used phone) rather than a third-party replica?\n\nA: In all likelihood the screen won't be original. You'll be able to tell from a number of factors but none of them are conclusive as fake screens can exhibit any of these indicators...\n\n\n*\n\n*The glass should be a deep black or neutral white, not grey, or cream.\n\n*The phone shouldn't feel heavier, often fake screens are much heavier.\n\n*The grille over the ear piece should have a fine black mesh not silver or with large holes, or missing.\n\n*After cleaning the screen, if you place the screen in a bright pin/spot light you should see a streaks of rainbow colours in a criss-crosssing diamond pattern.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The thickness should be the same as before, fake screens are often almost twice as thick as originals.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You shouldn't be able to see the proximity sensor in the glass, and if you can it should be a neutral grey not a blue transparent look.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Stop iTunes from launching when iPhone is connected I know this has been asked many times, but none of the solutions seems to apply to iTunes 12.1.\nWhen I plug my iPhone 6 into my Mac, iTunes (12.1) automatically launches.

If you don’t see the device summary page, go ahead and click on the iPhone icon toward the upper-left corner of the iTunes window.\nScroll all the way down to the bottom and make sure to uncheck Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected. This is the feature that automatically launches iTunes whenever you connect your iPhone to your computer, but with it disabled, you won’t be bothered by the program anymore when you connect your device.\nsource\n\nA: Try Image Capture.

If I update to iOS 8.4, will it crash, break the jailbreak, or hurt my iPhone?\n\nA: With any Jailbroken device, any update of any kind will break the Jailbreak. OTA updates (update from device in settings app) will kill your phone and force a restore. Updating through iTunes will revert the Jailbreak but leave the rest of your data untouched. I recommend updating to 8.4 and jailbreaking again with the new TAiG jailbreak tool (plus it gives you some laughs during the process because the translation is so horrible)!\nHope this helped, Nick\n\nA: It depends how you update it. If you connect to iTunes and update you shouldn't have problems, however, if you use OTA (the button in settings) your phone will be \"bricked\"\n\nA: update with itunes to the ios 8.4,this is the best method . you can jailbreak again with TaiG 2.4.1 read more http://rootjailbreak.com\n", "Q: Combine external mic and system sound and send output to HDMI I am looking to combine the system sound with an external mic plugged into the microphone jack and send the combined audio output to HDMI. Is this doable on my Macbook pro. I have tried different things with sound flower and creating aggregate devices and such without luck. I am able to create a recording in Quicktime which has the sounds sources mixed perfectly. But, I want to be able to send this output live through HDMI. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you are looking to combine separate HDMI video and audio into a single HDMI connection (to go to a monitor, for example) you need an HDMI Audio Injector\nThis device is separate from your MacBook Pro and will work with virtually any digital video source and either an analog or digital audio source.\nAs for getting the sound to/from your MBP, you will need a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI for the video and perhaps a USB Audio Device.  Here are two products I have personally used with good success:\nMini DisplayPort to HDMI\nUSB Audio Adapter\nYou hook the outputs up to the HDMI Audio Injector and you should get the results you are looking for.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Applescript to emulate key strokes I want applescript to input into microsoft excel \"No, (tab, tab again), Yes\".

System Events, Key Code and Keystroke looks kind of interesting in your case and should get you started.\n", "Q: Issue with burning Linux .iso file using Disk Utility I'm trying to create a Linux installation drive. I have an empty hard drive (MS-DOS format), and I already dragged the .iso file to the sidebar in the Disk Utility app. However when I press it the \"Burn\" option is still greyed out. Also, when I double click the .iso file it says \"no mountable file systems\". Does anyone know the solution to this?\n\nA: I don't think Disk Utility will let you \"burn\" an ISO to a hard drive. It might let you \"restore\" the content to the drive. Select the ISO image in the right-hand side, then drag and drop the hard drive into the \"Destination\" field and click \"Restore\". I don't have a device here to test, but that might work.\n\nNormally people \"burn\" ISO images to CDs or DVDs, or write them to USB memory sticks. If you have one of them available here are the relevant instructions for Ubuntu (these instructions should work for other Linux distributions too).

It seems the telco provider must have been blocking it, as it suddenly started working after months of not working without upgrading iOS, phone, or email systems.  Because of this I can only presume the telco changed something.\n\nA: No, there is no default firewall on iOS so you don't need to configure anything to access port 993. If connectivity is working fine via wifi but not a cellular connection, everything points to your cellular provider blocking port 993.\nAre you able to access your email from your phone via a 3G/4G connection? Or is it only a computer tethered to your phone that's not working?\n", "Q: iPhone not reacting when connected to electricity today in the morning when my phone woke me up i couldn't turn off the alarm clock (you just have to swipe to the left and everything is fine). It didn't respond to any touch gesture till i disconnected the phone from the power supply. After that everything went well! \nWhat was that? Could it be that the phone got too much power??\n\nA: What type of cable are you using? I've seen similar behaviour with\n\n\n*\n\n*Poor quality third-party Lightning cables\n\n*A poor quality USB charger\n\n\nI think there must be some form of 'leakage' which affects the working of the touch screen when using some sub-standard chargers/cables.

How can I back up to computer freely without using iTunes?\n\nA: when connecting your iPhone to your computer, head over to iTunes and make a backup. Make sure you're backup on your computer not on iCloud. Please visit this Page where you find the necessary informations about viewing saved text-messages:\nHow to Backup iPhone SMS to Your Computer - Hongkicat \nHope this helps :) \nCheers\nmoesphemie\n\nA: You should check out the app iExplorer and export the texts without iTunes, in a variety of formats directly to your computer. You can export many other files as well, including app data, photos, movies, etc. It can also open iTunes backups to extract files you may have deleted accidentally, mitigating the need to restore the entire backup. \nJust a happy customer: I have no financial stake in Macroplant.\n\nA: PhoneView will do the job for you. There is a free trial so you can see how it works. I don't have any stake in the company but I use their product. It is exactly what you need.\n\nA: For some reason the only open-source solutions I have found only work on computers running MacOS: https://github.com/PeterKaminski09/baskup\nTo export to Windows everything is commercial and runs $20-40/license.  The cheapest I found (and used successfully) was http://www.smsexport.com/download.php, which is activated via App Store for just $5.\n", "Q: How do I record my phone conversations on this phone? How do I record my conversations on this phone?\n\nA: It is not possible to record phone calls on an iPhone primarily due to the dubious legality of recording calls in most countries without someone's permission. However if your phone is jailbroken (not recommended) there are 3rd party apps.\nAlternatively you could look at using a cable to record from the headphone jack to a dictaphone or on speaker.\n", "Q: Iphone 5s ignoring some inbound calls I have an Iphone 5s that appears to randomly ignore calls from certain numbers.\nOther numbers appear to be able to connect, but most just ring out as if I just left the phone untouched.\nIf they leave a voicemail it pings immediately.\nThis is on O2 in the UK (I called their tech support and they say that it is a problem with the phone).\nAny idea of what could be done to fix this? Do I need a new handset?\n\nA: You need to backup your phone, reinstall the operating system and then recover the data back.\nThis should resolve the issue, however if not, then you may need to setup as a new iPhone.\nHere are the instructions on Apple's website\n\nA: Maybe you inadvertently blocked the numbers that can't reach you.\nTo check if that is the case, go to Settings > Phone > Blocked and check if the affected numbers are on the list.\nTo unblock them, tap \"Edit\" on the top right corner and then remove the numbers or contacts you'd like to allow calling you.\n", "Q: Can't see a specific external hard drive I was trying to make an NTFS hard drive writable on my macbook.

If not, open disk utility. Your external disk probably will be shown up at the left. Select it and first repair disk permissions. And also verify disk as well from here.  \n\n", "Q: Mac OS X Yosemite public beta not receiving updates I have a 2010 iMac and I installed Mac OS 10.10 public beta last summer, but I haven't received any updates since. My exact version right now is OS X 10.10 (14A379b).\nDoes anyone know what should i do to get the latest system updates?\n\nA: in my guess, your beta may be expired, so the solution would be a final yosemite install from app store.\n", "Q: 'True' Thunderbolt to DisplayPort or DVI cable? Is there a native Thunderbolt to DisplayPort or DVI cable?\nI understand that Thunderbolt is downwards-compatible to Mini DisplayPort, however I'm looking for an adapter cable using the Thunderbolt port in a native fashion;\nBackground: I want to run two displays off a Belkin Thunderbolt Express Dock 2, however it doesn't allow the Thunderbolt port to run in Display Port mode and using the HDMI port at the same time..\nSo I'm looking into some kind of adapter from (native) Thunderbolt to a non-Thunderbolt display without using the Mini DisplayPort compatibility mode..\nAny hints much appreciated!!\n\nA: I took a look at Belkin's website on this particular product and they clearly state that it \"Supports dual displays & 4K cinema resolution.\"\n\nNow, there is no \"Thunderbolt\" to DVI/HDMI because Thunderbolt is an extension of PCIe.  So, in a very basic sense, this would be like trying to plug your monitor in directly to the logic board and not go through the video adapter; it cannot happen.\nHowever, Thunderbolt \"multiplexes\" the DisplayPort signal on that single cable.  You are going to get both.  Now, if you use a a Thunderbolt compatible cable, you can daisy chain additional TB devices off your monitor, albeit at a reduced data transfer rate.  This is why monitors are the last in the chain.  If you use a non-TB cable, you will only get display and no TB signal.\nEDIT:\nIt was really bugging me that this didn't work because I was close to reccomending this product for a friend and I wanted to do my due diligence.  I found this on their support site:\n\nSo, basically, in order for you to get dual displays, you need a native Thunderbolt Display like these.\nIf you do go that route, remember you will need a Thunderbolt/Thunderbolt 2 cable\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't think what you want is possible unless one of your displays is a Thunderbolt display. See, for example, this FAQ on the Caldigit site (I'm guessing that most third party docks use similar technology internally, hence the link) as well as this quote from the product page:\n\nNote about dual displays: At least one display has to be Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 technology-ready. For displays that are not Thunderbolt technology-ready, the Thunderbolt port is backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort. The dock supports either HDMI or Mini DisplayPort, but not both. The dock supports only one display at 4K cinema resolution.\n\nThat said, I think it's primarily because there aren't any Thunderbolt to HDMI/DisplayPort adapters available (at least, I've not found one). I'm guessing that because Thunderbolt is plug compatible with Mini-DP that no-one has felt the need to make one.\nA possible workaround is something like the Zotac Mini DP to Dual HDMI Cable.\nSee also this thread discussing the same question.\n\nA: It is possible to do what you request - but it is not going to be using a simple cable.\nYou can connect a Thunderbolt-to-PCIe chassis to the dock and add an ordinary graphics card (GPU) to that chassis. That way you can add extra displays to the dock by using the Thunderbolt PCIe signal instead of the displayport-signal.\nUnfortunately, it's going to be more bulky and costly than a simple cable.\nFor Thunderbolt-to-PCIe chassis you could use for example the 269$ AKiTiO Thunder2 PCIe Box, or the 299$ OWC Mercury Helios. You would need to add on an ordinary graphics card to that price.\n\nA: I have an Apple Thunderbolt Display (ATD) plugged into Mac Pro 2013, Belkin TB2 dock plugged into ATD and Apple Cinema Display plugged into Belkin's second TB port. It works just fine, but sometimes the screens order is changed (it is a common problem and pain for all multidisplayers on New Pac Pro) and sometimes ACD doesn't switch on, so I have to re-plug the power to Belkin and everything goes just fine.\n", "Q: How to use previous iTunes icon? I'm have a MacBook Pro (x86_64) with OS X 10.8.5 (fully patched). When I got the MBP, the iTunes icon was a cool blue icon.\nRecently, Apple changed it to red. The psychologist tell us red indicates anger, defiance and hostility, and its a bad color. Its why USAir changed their color scheme from the shades of red to shades of grey. I did not like red, but I did not feel compelled to move.\nI got updates this week (July, 2015), and Apple changed the icon again:\n\nI despise that cartoony look, and now I am compelled to move. That cartoony look is one of the reason I have held back from OS X 10.9 upgrade for my personal equipment (and even one of the reasons to abstain from iOS upgrades). This is a personal preference, and I understand only a subset of folks feel the same way.\nI've been through iTunes preferences, but I don't see a way to change the icons.\nHow do I change the iTunes icons? Or how do I use the previous, blue icon?\n\nRelated, other reasons to abstain from the upgrade includes all the untested features and broken features that got added to 10.9. Quod erat demonstrandum: iCloud Keychain and CVE-2015-1065. My keychain was never at risk through this vector, and it was a conscious decision to avoid the risk.\n\nA: There are many ways to do this. Here are a few...\nIMO The best way is to replace the actual AppName.icns file with the one from the older version, in this case it's: /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/iTunes.icns\nSelect the application bundle and control-click (right-click) > Show Package Contents, then navigate to the AppName.icns file shown in the pathname above.  Note:  After replacing the AppName.icns file one may need to run killall Finder in a Terminal to force the updated AppName.icns file to show properly everywhere.  If it's not showing properly in the Dock afterwards run killall Dock in a Terminal.\nAnother way is to paste an image into the App's Info Sheet after selecting its icon at the top left of the Info Sheet.  Select the application bundle then control-click (right-click) > Get Info or  ⌘ -I.\nOr use a third-party app that can assign an new image/icon to the application bundle.\n", "Q: Trackpad and keyboard of MacBook Pro unresponsive My MacBook Pro (2014 model) trackpad and keyboard suddenly became unresponsive few days ago and I took it to the apple repair shop. \nToday they informed me it's a top case problem. I am curious, why would a top case cause problem in the trackpad and keyboard. Also, I have been taking great care of the MacBook, why is there a problem in the top case ? Is it because it is a defected unit and can I get a replacement?\n\nA: While I agree with Tetsujin that you need to ask the repair shop for details, it probably helps to understand some terminology.\n\"Top Case\", at least to me, is a bit of a misnomer.  You would think it would be the \"top\" or the case around the screen not the part that has the keyboard assembly...but hey...it is what it is.\nAnyway... the top case is the general term for the entire assembly that has the top cover of the Logic board, the keyboard, track pad, and power button.  \nWhen there is an issue with any one of these components, people generally say \"it's the topcase\" because it is royal PITA to change the individual components out.  However, on the MBP 2014 model, you can replace the trackpad w/o disassembling the topcase.  It still is a PITA, though.\nHere are some instruction on that repair for your reference.\nNow..... \"why did it go bad?\"  Any number of reasons from liquid damage, hitting it too hard, or it just wore out.  \nIs it defective and can you get it replaced?  Yes.\nThe follow up question is \"is your MBP under warranty or AppleCare?\"  If not, then you will be paying for the repair out of pocket.\nI hope that sheds some light on the problem.\n", "Q: HDMI display behavior on startup I have a display connected to the HDMI port of my laptop. When I start up the computer with the display plugged in, the built-in display does not turn on, and the external display becomes the primary.

I am trying to upgrade to 10.10(.4) - currently I am at 10.9.5.  I had previously done some \"creative\" :) partitioning of my rMBP SSD - everything was working fine, running Boot Camp as well.  However, the 10.10 installer didn't like my partitioning scheme (I did want to have a Recovery partition included), so I reduced the system back down to just the OS X (HFS+) partition and the Boot Camp (NTFS) partition.  However, in that re-partitioning, the \"Recovery HD\" partition become unhidden (everything still functions as it should).\nNow when I attempt the upgrade, the installer is still giving me grief about the state of the HD with the message:\n\nSome features of OS X 10.10 are not supported for the disk \"Mac HD\"\nFeatures such as FileVault and Recovery Mode won't be available of you install 10.10 on this disk. To learn more, click More Info. To continue with the installation, click Continue.\n\nI suppose it is likely I am getting this due to the fact that the Recovery HD is no longer hidden.  I would prefer to have the 10.10 recovery partition on the SSD if at all possible.\nSo - if I blow away the Recovery HD partition, will the installer Do the Right Thing and put a new Yosemite one in?  Maybe it will do so anyway?  Maybe do a reinstall of 10.9.5 so that (maybe?) hides the Recovery partition? Are there some flags I can set to manually hide the Recovery HD partition? (FBOW I am very familiar with GPartEd and gdisk.) Thanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: Well I did a bit more searching and came across this page which gave me the correct commands to hide the recover partition:\n%mount (find the partition of \"Recovery HD\")\n%diskutil unmount <partition>  (in my case: /dev/disk0s3 )\n%sudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk0s3 -settype Apple_Boot\n\nAfter this, I verified I could boot into all OSes (I could), went back to Yosemite installer and it approved of my partition scheme.  Everything is working great in 10.10 now.\n", "Q: Finding the directory an application uses for temporary files Is there procedure or tool that can be used to find the directory in which an application stores its temporary files?\nMy cloud backup service reports how many files remain to be backed up. This number increases by an order of magnitude whenever I open a particular application, and decreases when I close the application. Methinks these are temp files. To prevent my backup from wasting its time indexing and uploading them, I want to exclude that application's temporary file directory. I just need to figure out where it is. Rather than rooting around in the file system like an animal, I'd prefer to use a thoughtful tool or procedure to watch where the system (or the application) is putting these temp files.\n\nA: There are a few tools you can use to monitor file accesses but the two I'd recommend are (with their manual page descriptions):\n\n\n*\n\n*opensnoop - snoop file opens as they occur. Uses DTrace.\n\n*lsof - list open files\nBoth are shipped with Mac OS and should do what you need.

OS X is very different from Ubuntu or some other Linux distro.\nRegarding terminal contents:\n\n\n*\n\n*The standard directories are there, but they are in ls / (i.e. the root of the drive) not in ls ~ (the home folder of the current user).\n\n*Some of the directories are different because OS X is UNIX based, but primarily because it's got a lot of custom Apple stuff sitting on top.\n\n*Files and folders starting with a dot are hidden. They are used be various applications and services, it depends which one you are interested in as to the answer to your question.\nRegarding Kernel version features and abilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can find the details of your system with uname -a in the terminal.\n\n*I don't believe it is possible to modify the OS X kernel, I certainly wouldn't attempt to do so, it's unlikely to be something Apple anticipate, and software updates will likely overwrite this.\n\n*I don't know.\n\nA: *\n\n*How can I view these standard directories (provide commands/steps)\n\n\n\nYou view directories by issuing the ls in the root directory:\n\ncd /\nls -la\n\n\n\n  \n*Should these directories all appear, or MacOS doesn't include some of them ?\n  \n\nThe directories ultimately don't matter.  It's the application/function  and where it is located that matters.\n\n\n  \n*What do all files / directories starting with \".\" (dot) mean: a) what dot means ? b) what are they used for (by what application or\n  services) ?\n  \n\nThe single dot (\".\") means current directory.  The double dot (\"..\") means parent directory.  If I wanted to copy something from one directory to the directory I am in, I would use the single dot instead of typing out the directory again.  Example:\ncp /some/path/on/the/system/foo.bar .\n\nIf I wanted to copy something that was any number of directories above the one I was in, I would use the notation\ncp ../../../foo.bar .\n\n\n\n  \n*How to display MacOS Kernel version which is running\n  \n\nThe exact same way you would in Linux - with uname\nuname -a\nDarwin Allans-iMac.home 14.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 14.3.0: Mon Mar 23 11:59:05 PDT 2015; root:xnu-2782.20.48~5/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64  \n\nYou can also click on \"About this Mac\" on the GUI\n\n\n\n  \n*Can I upgrade manually Kernel version of MacOS without upgrading whole MacOS?\n  \n\nApple does not make their kernel freely available, so the short answer is no.  But, how do you update?  Your App Store app will notify you when updates are available for you to install.\n\n\n  \n*In general - what are the main differences of latest MacOS and (preferably refer to) latest Kernel version - from commands and\n  features point of view ?\n  \n\nIf you would like to see the changes from one version to the next, this Wikipedia article is a good place to start\n\nMeaning: what's in MacOS \"is missing\" and \"what extras\" it has\n  compared to standard Linux ?\n\nThat's too broad of a question given that \"Linux\" is only the kernel or core of the OS and \"MacOS\" used in your context is referring to the whole OS.  It is also too broad because there are too many different distributions of Linux from DSL, Mint, all the way to RedHat and Suse.\nOS X is not Linux.  OS X is based on BSD while Linux is the kernel that was  developed by Linus Torvalds. Linux Distributions like RedHat, Ubuntu, Mint, or Suse are based on the Linux kernel. \nYour question is like trying to figure out what is \"missing\" when comparing Lego to an Erector Set and all of its knock-offs.\nIt is advisable that you spend some time with Linux and OS X books and videos to gain a better understanding to the two operating systems.\nI hope this helps. \n", "Q: Failed startup after 10.10. upgrade After upgrading to 10.10.4 from 10.10.2, my Macbook Pro (late 2013) boots up to a blank screen with the mouse cursor displayed briefly every 10 seconds.

I have a retina MBP that according to my mum was working last time she put it under charge (with 15% left). However, as of now, I get no reaction at all after pressing the boot key. The screen stays off and I hear no noise. The computer has been under charge for several hours, but the charge indicator is not turning to green.\nThe laptop is under (European) warranty for the next few months. However, I'm reluctant in trying that route because I think it would be denied (at a charge) and I don't have file vault enabled.\nIs there something I can try myself? I'm the kind of guy with a oscilloscope on his workbench.\nEdit: The MBP started to work again out of the blue today without any action from my side. See my comment here.\n\nA: It could be something as simple as the MagSafe DC board or it could be the whole logic board. See below:\n\nNormally, I wouldn't recommend that a user change out this part as Apple goes out of their way to make a complex assembly, but since you have an oscilloscope on your workbench....\nThe part is relatively inexpensive as compared to a logic board and I have fixed MacBooks where this component has failed.  Ifixit has excellent tear down instructions on how to get at this component.\nYou didn't specify which specific model, so I grabbed the 2013 model for reference.  The link is:  https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2013+MagSafe+DC-In+Board+Replacement/17055.\nIf it isn't the right model, you can find the correct one on their site.  I hope this helps...\n", "Q: My MacBook pro Wi-Fi is slow, other devices are OK The problem is that the WiFi on my MacBook is so slow it is almost unusable, it can be compared to an EDGE connectivity. My iPad and Nexus 4 both work good and have no problems with WiFi and signal is strong even though I'm two rooms from my router. Anyone has an idea of what the problem could be?\n\nA: The fix provided by Buscar is a good one, but it's only temporary.  \nChannel crowding is a problem that will only become worse, not better.  As more and more people buy wireless routers, range extenders, and additional access points to solve their connection issues, you are going going to run out of channels.\nManually setting your channel today will fix the problem now, but tomorrow when the other wireless routers with their \"Auto Channel Setting\" suddenly take over the one you have set up, you are back to square one.\nThere are a couple of things to look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a dual band (or even tri-band) router.  This will give you many, many, more channels to work with.  The upside is that the 2.4GHz frequency will easily go through walls, but it will be very crowded.  The 5GHz frequency will be relatively quiet (for now), but has more difficulty going through walls.  You said you are only two rooms away...5GHz should be able to get to you with no problem.  The downside is that they are pricey.  Prices start at $150.\n\n*Run a CAT5e cable.  For the price of a high quality router, you can run a CAT5e drop between the two rooms with the cable in the wall.  Don't run a 50 or 100 foot patch cable.  Put in some plenum rated CAT5e and terminate properly.  This will give you a nice, solid gigabit connection. \n\n\nI personally have done the latter because I had the exact same problem as you are experiencing.\nI have a Surface Pro 3 and a iMac that have CAT5e connections on my desk and I have zero connection issues.  When I do a scan of my Wi-Fi, I have about 20 different networks all fighting for space (I live in a condo)\nEven if you want to \"float around\" with your MBP and not be tethered to a cable, you can still run the cable and hook up an inexpensive router or WAP, turn down the transmission power of the antennas and ensure a good WiFi network in your room only. (I've done this in the bedroom for the Kindle)\nOne big benefit is that the gig connection between my computers and my Synology NAS means super fast file transfers.  What used to take 10+ mins to copy now only take a few seconds.\n\nA: Your MCS is zero (0) which would explain why your WiFi is slow.\nThat can happen if there is channel crowding (not only from your devices but neighbors included).\nYou could just change the channel for now 1 to 5 and try.\nOr you could do a quick analysis of the channels do following:\nIn Spotlight type \"Wireless Diagnostics\"\nClick on Wireless diagnostics to start it.\nNow in the menu bar click on the Window - Utility - WiFi scan -Scan Now.\nSort the result by channel so you can see how crwoded are the channels.\nOpen your FritzBox set up page and set it to the least occupied channel.\nIf you do not know how, open any of the following  Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari.\nIn the address window type 192.168.178.1 , that should open the FritzBox set up page.\n\nA: This is a bit stupid but I always connect my workphone to charge it and iTunes asks every time if I want to allow the phone to connect to my Mac. I always select no and did so today also. But somehow it still connected to internet sharing over usb and prioritised this over our office wifi..\nI only realised after removing the wifi to add it again, I still had internet :P After disabling internet sharing on my phone it became fast again :P \n\nA: My router doesn't have an option to change the channel, but it allows for splitting the wifi to two seprate bands - 2.4ghz and 5ghz from a signle 2.4/5 one. 2.4ghz is as slow as before, but 5ghz is super fast! This would suggest that my 2.4ghz band is indeed channel crowded...\n", "Q: Repeat on iOS 8.4 music app? Where is the repeat button on a song for iOS 8.4 music app? Help! \n\nA: When playing a song, tap on the Miniplayer (the bar above the Music app button selections, it shows your song title and artist, etc., it changes per song) to bring up the full song player. Once you are in the full song view, you will have access to the shuffle and repeat buttons.\n\n", "Q: How do I install an older version of an app on an iPhone? I want to install the Trello App on my iPhone. On the phone I have iOS 7. When I try to install the App, it tells me it needs at least version 8 of iOS.\nI do not want to upgrade my iOS version, especially for the sole purpose of installing an App. However, I do want to use it, it's kind of important.\nI searched for a while about how to do this, but I could only find solutions that would work if you installed the App before and it shows up on the \"Purchases\" page in iTunes or something like that. And this doesn't apply to this case.\n\nHow can I install an older version of the App (one that requires \"only\" iOS 7) without having to upgrade the operating system on my iPhone ?\n\nA: If you still use iTunes download the current version of the app to your computer so that you have \"ownership\".\nNow, on your phone, go to the App Store and attempt to download from the cloud. You will be told that this version is not compatible and be offered an older version. Accept the offer and you will have a working version on your phone.\nDon't forget to backup when you are done.\n\nA: I just did this with the Phillips Hue app (compatible 8.0+) and using iOS 7.0.4. Basically, you download the app from the App Store in your computer. Then, find the app on your phone and instead of Get+ it should display the Cloud download. If the app has an older compatible version available, you should be able to install it. It worked for me!\n\nA: It sounds like the Apple Support article explains what you need to do to get the app in the version you want. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the App Store on your iPhone. \n\n*Press Updates and then press Purchased.\n\n*When you get there, it should show your Apple account and it will say\nMy Purchases. \n\n*Press that and it will show you all of your apps\n\n*Find Trello and try to download it. If a version of the app that is compatible with your version of iOS is available on the App Store, it will let you download it to your phone.\n\n*If the version is not available, go to the iTunes App Store, find the app and click Ratings and Reviews. \n\n*There is a button there that says App Support. Click that and then put in a query to the developer. They may be able to let you directly download the version of the app that you need from them.\n\n\nIf all of this fails, possibly other options like Todoist have the older version of their app that you can access.\nThis is unfortunately not going to help you with this app, as it does not sound like you had downloaded this app prior to this question, but it will help you in the event that you accidentally upgrade an app that will then no longer work with your version of iOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes and Delete the new version of the App from your library and also from your drive.\n\n*Go to the Music>iTunes>iTunes Media>Mobile Applications folder on your drive.\n\n*In that folder will be all of the current apps plus a folder called Previous Mobile Applications.\n\n*Previous Mobile Applications stores all of the old versions of your Apps each time you do an update through iTunes.\n\n*Find the version of the App that works with your version of iOS and drag and drop it onto iTunes. iTunes will reload that version of the App into your library and move the file back into the Mobile Applications Directory.\n\n*Delete the app from your phone, then just sync your phone and the old app should be loaded in. You may need to click on the phone and apps in iTunes and have iTunes add it.\n\n\nBest of luck on getting the app.\n\nA: 3uTools from www.3u.com allows you to add iOS apps to your iCloud apple account, so that it appears in your purchase history so you can download it on an old iOS version.\n\nA: The answer is not easy given, because if you follow the above Apple instruction, the ipa file would also be in the purchased list of the Appstore...\nIn Mac iTunes 12.3.1 in my ElCapitan all (old and new) are in the same folder \"Mobile Applications\" folder, but each app the latest version that was once installed.\n", "Q: What happens to existing free users if an App gets moved from free to paid? Hey I have a free app in iTunesconnect that's being downloaded about 100 times a week. Mostly no user responses, no support requests or anything so I thought (I know this is selfish) I can make some free money by making the app worth $.99 so maybe some \"accidental\" buyers are too lazy to refund it.\nNow the thing is: I still want users who downloaded the app for free continue using the app for free - is that possible as the transaction is already on their iCloud account? Or will they be asked to buy the app as soon as they try to install it on a new device?\n\nA: The user buys an app for the price it is sold at that point. Future changes to the price have no effect on them. It is on their Apple ID that they own the app and they will be able to download the app for free as long as it's available (no matter the price).\n", "Q: OSX Stuck - Window manager is responsive, but can't create any process Shortly (seconds) after booting, the OS (10.6.8) becomes unresponsive. Not a single process can be created, but the window manager is responsive - I can switch focus between existing windows and some already loaded programs - e.g. Terminal, Finder, etc but I cannot run any new processes - opening a browser, or even executing \"ls\" from command prompt yields no results. \nThere are no obvious CPU hogs - I managed to quickly run \"top -u\" with no high CPU util at the point it gets stuck (at one point the top utility stops refreshing, I suspect it spawns a new process for each refresh).\nAny clues appreciated.\n\nA: After trial and error, the correct answer proved to be such: disable IPv6.\nThe OSX machine started to freeze when I switched internet connection and WiFi router. \n\nA: I have a theory and it is pretty easy to test...\nI think the permissions on your Admin account are corrputed, not allowing you to spawn new processes.

I have done what I described below using guides and lots of trial and error\nI have a functioning AppleScript which has 2 prompts for a user name and password which then proceeds to mount some network volumes based on an LDAP lookup. I have created a new AppleScriptObjC Xcode 6.4 project and brought in the code from the working AppleScript. Using interface builder, I created a simple input window and linked it up with the following code:\n-- IBOutlets\nproperty theWindow : missing value\nproperty accountName : missing value\nproperty passwordName : missing value\n\n-- IBActions (button clicks)\non setCredentialsFromUserInput_(sender)\n    set accountName to accountName's stringValue()\n    set passwordName to passwordName's stringValue()\nend setCredentialsFromUserInput_\n\nI linked the OK button with the IBAction described above and the ID and password fields with the associated IBOutlets above. The project builds and runs ok, but when I click the OK button, nothing happens. It does not proceed to execute the rest of the code in the project. I assume I am missing something basic here—thoughts?\nUpdate #1:\nHere is the rest of the code in the script. Most of this was imported from an earlier working version of this app written in AppleScript Studio (I believe). I expect you will find other errors in here as well, but my primary concerns is why nothing seems to move along when I click OK.\n-- Set text delimiters\n-- From previous version of Map Drives

When I pressed play it went to a yahoo page and was like a yahoo mail login and I put my email password in. Shortly afterwards I received over 100 emails daemon mailer unable to deliver. I deleted them and changed my yahoo email password but I am now concerned that there may be a virus on my ipad. What should I do?\n\nA: This is known as Phishing or Social Engineering.\nYou were tricked into giving away your login details, by being directed to a site that looked familiar, but which wasn't actually the legitimate site you thought it was.\nYou were correct to immediately change your password. In most situations this is sufficient to prevent further access by the phishers.  They don't really want to go to any effort to spread their spam, fooling you once would be enough; trying to hack you after you changed the password would be too much like hard work.\nIt is very unlikely that any malware is on your iPad - but it may 'remember' the fake site in your history, so be careful when going to the legitimate site that you do indeed have the right one.\nIf you normally use password auto-fill on your iPad, then one very good sign of a fake site is that the iPad will not offer to auto-fill. As far as it's concerned it's not the same site. It is far more likely to notice the difference between yahoo.com & yalhoo.com etc than a human.\nSee Jaime Santa Cruz's answer for further practical advice.\n\nA: Check your Yahoo! account preferences or settings for redirects, filters, changes on the security questions, secondary addresses that could have been modified.\nAn iPad virus is not very probable but not impossible, especially if your iPad is jailbroken.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't click on emails' links\n\n*If you really want to click on them; tap and keep pressed the link so it will show you the URL. This is not really totally fool proof, as described in the link on point 1.\n\n*Check the URL: it should relate to what you're supposed to be\nclicking on. In this case, it should have something to do with\nWhatsApp, so one would expect .whatsapp.com at the beggining of the URL. If\nit asked you for your Yahoo! credentials, https://.yahoo.com should\nbe on that URL, and an 's' should probably be there after the http\nindicating it is a secure site.\n\n*If you already clicked on the link, repeat step 3. The URL is written on the top of your browser.\n\n*If you have any doubt, close the page, and do not enter your credentials. \n\n*If you do not understand any of this instructions, go to step 1.\n\n\nWhat probably happened is that a bot used your Yahoo! account to send spam and lot of fake whatsapp messages to everyone on your contact list after it obtained the credentials you gave it on the fake Yahoo! login page. All of the contacts that had invalid email addresses gave back a typical bounce message issued by the Mailer-Daemon.\n", "Q: Can iPhone 6 tell if a surface is horizontal? I can launch the Compass app on my iPhone 4 and it can tell if the surface I'm placing it on is perfectly horizontal, or it's bending to any direction.

You are backing up, right?\nThere are a couple more options you can try before you take your iphone in for repair to get at your data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth Keyboard - just connect and enter your pin\n\n*Voice Over - triple tap the home button and \"say\" your pin\n\n\nBoth of those must have been previously set up.  If you didn't set them up, they aren't going to work.  \nOne more you may want to try...\nIf either of those two methods are unavailable, try PhoneView which will allow you to get access to everything on your phone via your Mac.  It costs about $30, but that may be cheap considering how valuable your data is.\nFinally, if all else fails, you will have to have the digitizer replaced.  Maybe a local repair shop can hook up a digitizer temporarily so you can back up your data, but that would be a long shot.\n", "Q: iPhoto does not recognise the photos on the SD card of my new camera. I am running Lion on iMac and iPhoto is up to date.  my new camera is a sony a6000.  The photos show up in the import window, even with an image of the camera, but when I ask iPhoto to import them it comes up with a message saying Unreadable Files - file is in unrecognised format. The photos are RAW but I've never had a  problem importing RAW files before. This is what the file is displaying as in the unreadable files window.\n/Users/SueHewett/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Import/Masters/Roll 1/_DSC2044.ARW\n\nA: According to Apple's RAW format support page, Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 support was added in Digital Camera RAW Compatibility Update 5.06 released in August 2014.  This update requires a minimum of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 with iPhoto version 9.4.3 or later.  \nI recommend upgrading to the latest OS X version supported by your Mac. \n", "Q: RAM upgrade MacBook pro 15 inch mid-2010 on \"El capitan\" I have a MacBook pro 15 inch mid-2010 i5 2,4 Ghz, which I already have upgraded to 8GB of RAM. I recently tried to upgrade my MacBook's RAM to 16GB on Yosemite and it gets a kernel panic, I know others Macbook Pros can do it. But now I have 16GB on my desk and I don't know if i should have a little of faith, wait until \"el capitan\" get released and the computer could support the 16GB or better to loose any hope and sell them. \n\nA: Officially your Model only supports up to maximum of 8 GB RAM. So you are at maximum already. \nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.4-aluminum-15-mid-2010-unibody-specs.html\nYour alternative is to upgrade from Hard Drive to SSD, that would speed things up.\n\nA: I partially disagree with the approved answer: I have a MacBook Pro 13 2010 with 12Gb RAM.\nIt's true that Apple OFFICIALLY says they support only 8GB because. There's a reason: there wasn't 1066Mhz 8GB RAM sticks at the time of 2010 release. The maximum size of a 1066Ghz stick was only 4GB. So i think their QA only tested the computer using 4GB sticks.\nBut there's a way which I use to reach 12GB. The trick is using a 4GB 1066Mhz stick in the slot 0 working together with an 8GB 1333Mhz stick in slot 1. This config clocks down the second stick to 1066Mhz and OSX works like a charm with 12Gb of RAM.\nI've heard about a specialized vendor which sells 1066Mhz 8GB memory sticks compatible with 2010 model, which can upgrade your RAM to 16Gb, but I've never seen one of these.\nBut there's one thing that I agree the original answer: the SSD upgrade worths. 12Gb RAM + SSD you won't regret.\n", "Q: Download source Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 and later I need download source Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 (and later) to create USB and boost it.\nBut I can't find the way download it.\nWith Yosemite 10.10, I download from the following link:\nhttps://thepiratebay.am/torrent/11231245/OS_X_Yosemite_10.10\n\nA: Did you download and install Yosemite previously? It should be still available for download when you will open Apple Store. In terms of specific branch (10.10.X), you can always download 10.10 and then once the Yosemite is installed, perform an update to apply Hotfixes to the recent 10.10.X version.\n", "Q: In Microsoft Word 2011, Shift seems to be acting as a Command - how do I make it stop? Some specific behaviors I'm observing in Microsoft Word 2011 on my Mac: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shift + F moves the cursor into the Find box on the toolbar, instead of typing a \"F\" character.\n\n*Shift + 9 opens help instead of typing a \"(\". \n\n\nIt seems like the Shift key is functioning as a Command key. I haven't made any changes to my Word settings to customize keyboard shortcuts. I did install another IME last night and configure the shortcuts to switch between IMEs, but the behavior only occurs in MS Word.\nAny ideas on restoring default functionality?\n\nA: It's possible you could try resetting the default shortcuts from the settings...\nThis is an excerpt from a Microsoft support article on the Office shortcut settings...\n\nReset all keyboard shortcuts\nOn the Tools menu, click Customize Keyboard.\nTo restore keyboard shortcuts to their original state, click Reset All, and then in the confirmation message, click Yes.\nNOTE   Keyboard shortcuts for tasks are reset.\n\nSource\n", "Q: How to delete search suggestion on mac safari(iCloud)? By\"delete\"I mean remove, not disable. I still want to keep that function for other sites. Just an annoying site keep bothering me when I search google in safari.\nThe search suggestion still exist after I removed all the history, bookmarks, readinglist. Even reinstall safari. It seems hide in icloud, not only in local mac.\nAny comments would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You should probably try clearing the browsing data on all of your devices connected to that iCloud account. iCloud now syncs your bookmarks and history across all devices. It's possible that particular site suggestion is from a separate device.\n", "Q: Interrupt SMS notification sound On our on-call duty phone we receive SMSs from our server monitoring system. The notification tune is quite long and the phone is intentionally loud.\nIs it possible to interrupt the tune once it starts playing on iOS 8?\nOn a previous version of iOS (I can't recall which version this was) it was possible by pushing the On/Off button on the top-right or the Volume Down button on the left.\n\nA: Yes, using the mute switch for a moment, then put it back to non-muted mode. The volume did used to work, and will still silence calls, but I haven't tried on other alerts of late.\nCould be a bug, or issue with your phone. I will try it next time mine goes off, and report back.\n", "Q: How to tell if service centre installed tampered MacOS? I gave my MacBook to a service center that claims they are authorized apple service centre in Bangladesh (we don't have official apple inc in Bangladesh). They said they will reinstall Mac os Yosemite in my mid2012 MacBook which should solve my problem in the MacBook. After i received my MacBook back from the service center, i am noticing some lag and some tids and bits here and there which makes me feel like it's an altered version of Mac OS like those pirated BlackWndows installations. How do i confirm if they have given me untampered/unaltered mac os Yosemite or original Yosemite. \nP.s. My \"About This Mac\" section doesn't even show which year-model my MacBook is whereas it did show the year-model properly before i sent it out to the service center. I feel that they have modified a lot of configuration files etc.\nI want to challenge them if they are cheating like this and charging a lumpsome money for it?\n\nA: You never did say what the problem with your MBP was that Yosemite would solve.\nAs for \"altering\" the OS, that makes no sense as it would be far easier to install malware since they are the ones who are doing the install.   They, by default, have all the Administrator credentials they need to do whatever they want.\nIt's just too easy at that point and not worth the extra effort of modifying the OS.\nNow, all that said, if you believe that your OS has been tampered with, assume that it has been.  This will bug and haunt you until you address the problem fully.  You can address this by installing a new version of the OS yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can download a copy of Yosemite for free directly from Apple.\n\n*Make a USB Key or DVD installer (Macworld has a great tutorial\nfor this)\n\n*Use the new USB or DVD and reinstall Yosemite (format your drives,\ndon't upgrade)\n\n*Put that DVD or USB Key away in a safe place.\n\n\nAs for your hardware, there is no way possible for anyone to determine if they did anything nefarious to it; like swap out good components for bad.  The one exception is your serial number that's embedded in the firmware of the logic board.  When you click \"About This Mac\" the Serial Number displayed should match the serial number on the bottom of the machine.  I added pictures for your reference.  Those numbers should match.\n\n\nIf they don't match, then you have something to go on.  But they are going to say that this is how they got it.  If you purchased directly from Apple, then you are going to need all the documentation you can get that identifies your SN#.  This is going to be a tough hill to climb, unfortunately, if this is in fact, the case.\nNow...what was the problem that you were initially experiencing?  If it is still present, then you need to search for it here on Stackexchange and if it doesn't exist or no suitable answer exists, open up a new question.  There are some super friendly and helpful people here.\n\nA: If you just think they've done it to save money, then there would be no point in them doing it. Unlike Windows, you can freely download and install the official version of OS X on any Mac hardware, so it would be easier for them to do that than to give you a bogus version. And if you think they've done it to spy on you, then there are much worse things they could have done to your hardware, such as installing a keylogger. So if you trust the service centre not to spy on you then there's nothing to worry about, and if you don't then you need to scrap your MacBook and get a new one. Either way, you don't need to worry about its OS X installation.\n", "Q: Notifications and quick settings panes stop working on iPhone After some time the notification slidedown and quick controls slideup(?) suddenly stop working. IOS8, iPhone 6. After reboot they work again and then again don't (after maybe several days). When the phone is locked, both panes work correctly.\nWhat could it be and how to fix it?\n\nA: This sounds like a software fault, the best solution is to backup and reinstall our phone.\nThis guide on Apple.com will explain how.\n", "Q: Can't share Internet connection from MacBook to iPhone I have my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.10.4) connected via WiFi. \niPhone 5s 8.4 is connected via bluetooth to the MBP. But I can't navigate on the Internet from my phone. \nHere's the setup:\n\n\nCan someone help me to navigate the Internet from the iPhone using the MacBook's connection?\n\nA: The question you are asking seems unclear, but I think you are asking if you can share internet connectivity from your computer to your iPhone (or other iOS devices) via Bluetooth.\nIn this case the answer is no this is not possible, however you can share via Wi-Fi.\nYou can share (tether) your iPhone, or Cellular iPad's data connections to your computer via Bluetooth, USB or Wi-Fi but not the reverse. \nThis article on Apple.com explains the later option\n\nA: To share the WIFI internet connection on one MacBook to another MacBook (iOS devices will be similar) via bluetooth:\nOn laptop WITH WIFI internet connectivity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences >> Sharing >> Internet Sharing\n\n\n*\n\n*Select: \"Internet Sharing\"\n\n*Select: \"Share your connection from WIFI\"\n\n*Check: \"To computers using Bluetooth PAN\"\n\n*De-select Bluetooth Sharing (I am uncertain if this is necessary)\n\n*Check: Internet Sharing (and accept the dialog that opens)\n\n\n*Preferences >> Network >> WIFI\n\n\n*\n\n*Click: \"Advanced...\"\n\n*Click: \"TCP/IP\"\n\n*Screenshot the IPv4 address, subnet mask and router (CMD+SHIFT+4, drag selection to capture)\n\n*Click: \"DNS\"\n\n*Screenshot the DNS Server(s) and Search Domain(s)\n\n\n*Preferences >> Network >> Bluetooth PAN\n\n\n*\n\n*Click: \"Advanced\"\n\n*Select: \"Configure IPv4 manually\"\n\n*Input: IPv4 address, subnet mask and router per the screenshot taken above\n\n*Select: \"Configure IPv6 Automatically\"\n\n*Click: DNS tab\n\n*Input: DNS Servers and Search Domains per screenshot taken above\n\n*Click: OK\n\n\n\nOn laptop WITHOUT WIFI internet connectivity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn WIFI off\n\n*Pair bluetooth with the other laptop\n\n*Preferences >> Network >> Bluetooth PAN\n\n\n*\n\n*Select: \"Device \"\n\n*Click: Connect\n\n*Click: \"Advanced...\"\n\n*Select: Configure IPv4 Using DHCP\n\n*Select: Configure IPv6 Automatically\n\n*Click: DNS tab\n\n*Enter: DNS Servers: PAN network IP of the other laptop (probably 192.168.2.1)\n\n*Enter: Search domains copied from the screenshot taken on other laptop (unsure if this is necessary)\n\n*Click: OK\n\n\n\nThat should work. Complicated I know.\n", "Q: What's the difference between the OS X version and build numbers? Just for my curiosity and knowledge, from a software and hardware perspective, what's the difference between the OS X version and build numbers?\nExample: Version 10.10.3 (14D136)\n\nA: System Version Number follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention. From this site:\n\nGiven a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\n\n*\n\n*MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,\n\n*MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and\n\n*PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.\n\nAdditional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.\n\nThe number in brackets (14D136) is the build number (more info on the Apple site). This number is mainly for Apple developers, since normal users do not have access to non-public builds. In continuous integration, new builds can be made daily/weekly - every time the build number is incremented. When the developers/PMs (or anyone else in charge) is \"happy\" with the build, it can be released. Build numbers are constructed arbitrarily (I don't know of any standard numbering). It looks like Apple increments the first number by every MINOR release, then the letter with PATCH release and the last number is the real build number.\n", "Q: iPad wire-connection issues I use an iPad Air 1 (8.4) and a MacBook Pro mid 2014 13''(10.10.4)\nWhenever I try to connect my iPad to my MacBook with a lightning-usb wire it starts connecting but then disconnects immediately. This process is repeated multiple times a second and even crashes my MacBook. \nAs a result, I can't move the mouse or write with the keyboard anymore. Animations, slideshows or videos still continue in the background, but even after I close the display and open it again, only the cursor for the password input blinks, but I can't enter anything. Hard-reset is the only way to recover the MacBook.\nThe iPad behaves like nothing happened and just continues working.\nSometimes it just holds connection for a minute but that's only very few times.\nI tried with different 10.10s and wires, but it never works.\nAs it turns out, it's a specific problem of one USB port go my MacBook, which usually works just fine, but now causes trouble.\n\nA: It's likely that there is a fault with the connector either in the computer, or the cable, as you say you've tried another port and it's working I would suggest that there is a fault with that port.\nDo other devices have similar intermittent disconnection issues?\nAs the USB bus on most modern computers also supports the keyboard, trackpad, FaceTime/iSight Camera and the SD Card reader it's likely that the USB device rapidly connecting and disconnecting dozens of times is causing either a software issue in the kernel extension that manages USB devices, or causing the hardware to shut down the USB hub in the machine to protect it from damage.\nEither way, I would suggest trying with a couple other devices, and also check with another Lightning Cable for your iPad and if the issue persists seek service at your nearest Authorised Apple Service Provider, such as an Apple Store.\n\nA: After a broad search, I found this solution which worked for me:\nOn the iPad tap Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy. This will reset your location and privacy settings and require you to set up a trust relationship with the PC/laptop again. \nBut if you are running out of options ... try that and see if it works. I realize this thread is older, but posting this solution here in case it helps other people.\n", "Q: How to expand partition into free space that lies before it I would like to expand my \"journal\" partition to include the free space that lies (logically) before it on the drive. How can I do this without losing the data in \"journal\".\n\nI have a few more iterations to go through but I'm eventually going to move everything on the NTFS partition into journal, but I have to keep moving and expending/shrinking to make enough room.\n\nA: You can't do what you are asking, per se.  What you would have to do is create new partition \"above\" your existing partition, copy the data there, kill the partition below, then expand the partition with the data into the newly created free space.\nYou can do this with  Disk Utility.  OS X Daily has a really good write up on it (limited on how to resize the partition)\nHowever, I am personally not a fan of resizing disks with any sort of data on it.\nI prefer to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy all data from the drive to my desktop, a USB, burn a DVD;\nbasically make a backup copy of the drive.\n\n*Using Disk Utility, erase and repartition the drive.\n\n*Copy data back to the drive.\n\n\nYes, it's a bit old school, but it is super reliable (not that the partition resizing is a failure by any means).

I seriously can't find the other files and my trashcan is empty.\nCan somebody please help me with this?\n\nA: \nIf you know the name of one of the movies (files) that you are looking for or if you know what format the movie is in (extension) then you should be able to use Spotlight search\nMy favorite way to bring it up is hit Command-Space and you will see a search bar in the middle of your screen (Yosemite)\nStart typing the name or file extension and if it exists, you will start seeing search results pop up.\nSelect any of the files and hit Command-I for Get Info and you should see a window like this pop up:\n\nUnder the \"General\" tab, you will see a field labeled \"Where\".  This is the path to your file where it's located.  In this example, the location is /Applications.\nYou can now use Finder to \"Go to that folder\".

MAMP runs fine, used it all day and left it running overnight. Upon waking up the iMac, I have noticed the system is hanging:\n\n\n*\n\n*Websites not opening in Chrome\n\n*Stopping servers in MAMP doesn't respond\n\n*Force quit Chrome and tried to restart but doesn't work\n\n*Opened Safari but it won't open any URL\n\n*Beach ball appears when hovering over the Wifi icon\n\n*Restarted Mac but system gets stuck on a black screen with a white, spinning icon as if something is in progress\n\n*Only way to reuse iMac is through holding the power button and powering back on\n\n\nI'm relatively new to OSX so not entirely sure where to look and how to diagnose. The only theory I have at the moment is that MAMP is somehow hanging the system (it's the only recent change to the system other than Ruby on Rails and a few other development frameworks installed but I haven't used these in a few days).\nAny ideas on where to look or how to diagnose?\n\nA: This may not answer your question directly, but it is a solution....\nI am not a fan of doing dev work on my production Mac.  I also don't see any value in setting up a MAMP server because it will be a very rare occurrence that you get a hosting provider with MAMP setup.  Chances are it will be LAMP and by a very small margin, WAMP.\nWhy not set up a LAMP box with CentOS in a virtual machine.  VirtualBox would be a good choice for this.  The beauty with this is that when your Mac goes to sleep, it automatically puts the VM into a saved state - meaning when wakes, it is right where it left off.\nThe other huge benefit is that you can move that VM to other machines where as your MAMP setup, you are pretty much bound to your hardware.\nJust a thought....\n", "Q: How to sync reading list from iPhone to mac without iCloud I have lots of links in safari reading list on my iPhone and I want to sync it all with safari on my mac but without using iCloud.

I'm wondering if he's monitoring my messages and there was a glitch in the system?\nFor the record, I don't think I have an iCloud account... so it's not as though my friend and I are sharing that or have any relation (therefore no link in Apple ID)\nI've researched why this is and can't find anything!

I've putt instructions for that further down incase anyone else has this question...\nIt's possible but unlikely that you've got Text Message Forwarding setup, but seems strange that it would be just your dad who this was happening with. You can check in Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding and verify that if there are any other devices listed they are all yours.\nThe other possibility very likely possibility is that he does have your friends number and has sent you a group text in the past to both of you, and is now using that same group text thinking it's just you... \nThere is no way for him to have hacked you phone to get your messages, and frankly if he had, there is no reason why it would have accidentally sent a text from his phone to your friends as a clone. I think you are being somewhat paranoid. There is no easy way to run software that would allow this on a normal iPhone, if you did Jailbreak it then perhaps, but you dad would have to be seriously computer literate to even have a clue, and would also have to be okay with breaking the law, as most countries forbid this kind of activity.\nI think this is extremely unlikely your dad is monitoring your texts, and you should just approach your dad and let him know that he sent the same text to you as your friend, could he have a look at it because it could be embarrassing in future.\nLinked iMessage\nIt's very likely that at some point you've logged into your friends iPhone some how or they've logged into yours and left iMessage logged in on one device or another...\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings on both iPhones.\n\n*Messages\n\n*Send & Receive\n\n\nHere check that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple ID on both phones is your's not your friends, and that both phones have different Apple IDs.\n\n*The list of 'You can be reached by iMessage at' addresses only displays phone numbers and email addresses that are yours.\n\n*Check that the 'Start new conversations from' list has that iPhone's phone number selected.\n\n", "Q: How to change the color of Exchange's shared calendar in iCal in 10.10?

I might add a step of ps ux|grep [C]alendarAgent to check for them- and if still active, quitting more applications and re-doing the killall.\nIn case that page goes away: a command-line version of the instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*cd Library/Calendars\n\n*grep -ir \"human-readable unique name of calendar\"\n\n*search results will have a common directory pattern at the start.\n\n*cd that directory\n\n*there will be a subdirectory ending in \".exchange\"\n\n*cd that directory. \n\n*less Info.plist - look for <key>Color</key> and the next line has a hex color. That color should match the old color as appeared in ical. \n\n*killall -u yourusername CalendarAgent\n\n*wait 30 seconds\n\n*ps ux |grep [C]alendarAgent\n\n*if anything is returned, you're still running something that restarted calendaragent. quit more things. Go back to 8.\n\n*rm ~/Library/Calendars/Calendar\\ Cache-bak \n\n*vim Info.plist and replace the color with your preferred color.\n\n*re-start the calendar app. et voila!\n\n\nA: I had the same problem in a Office365 domain. The solution was to let the owner of the calendar change the color in her own iCal. Then this color will change in other users iCal also.  \n", "Q: In non-native applications, in the Open File dialog, I can see hidden files but I can't select them I have a problem with some non-native mac software (Perforce Diff and Kdiff3). \nWhen I use the Open File Dialog, I can see the hidden files, but I can not select them or interact with them at all.\nIn contrast, when using the native Mac TextEdit, when I use the Open File Dialog, I can see and open the hidden files.\n\nThis is a screenshot of the Kdiff3 Open File Dialog.

How do I fix this? It was fine up until a couple of days ago and everything was working. Should I bring it into an Apple store?\n\nA: This happens frequently to me, but turns out my phone is simply connected to a bluetooth device that I thought was turned off. Try turning off bluetooth just to eliminate this as an issue.\n\nA: Apple Support has this to say:\n\nFix common issues\nFollow these steps, testing after each with Voice Memos.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Unplug anything plugged into the headset jack.\n  \n*If you're on a call and holding your phone next to your ear, speak into the microphone and make sure you don't block it with your fingers\n  or shoulder.\n  \n*If you're using a screen protector or case that covers the microphone, remove it. Clear any debris from the microphones.\n  \n*Restart your device.\n  \n*Update to the latest version of iOS.\n  \n\nThe mic used for normal calls is the bottom one, check for debris and remove it carefully. There is a membrane between the mic and the phone internals, be careful not to puncture it.\n\nCouldn't find a better pic, sorry.\nThere are two more microphones, one beside the camera on the back and other near the speaker on top iPhone the phone, they are used for videos and noise canceling; clean them carefully too.\n\nA: Sometimes simply restarting the iPhone solves most of the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and Hold Power + Home button for few seconds until you see Apple logo rebooting.\n\n\nThis works in my case, most of the time.

Does anyone know if it is possible to upgrade the SSD after I have bought it? \n\nA: Is it possible?  \nYes.\nThe question is can you get a drive to upgrade to?\nApple uses a \"proprietary PCIe 2.0 x4\" interface for their storage.  There are SSDs out there that match the specs (like this Samsung on Amazon), but for some reason they are not compatible\nSo, bottom line....\nYes, you can upgrade it, but only with a genuine Apple SSD (at this point).  Your best bet is to get the most you can afford now because there is zero cost savings plus the added headache of disassembly/reassembly.  IMO, it just isn't worth it.\n", "Q: Put Backup on Old iPhone Is it possible, using iTunes, to put a backup of a currently active iPhone onto an older iPhone that has no service?\nBasically I want to keep all the text conversations on a separate older device.\nIt's a backup of an iPhone 6 and I want that backup placed on an iPhone 4S.\nThanks!\n\nA: Alternatively there are apps that let you download texts off, such as PhoneView by ecamm but I heard they stopped working in one of the most recent updates, so I would check the demo first.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. \nThe iPhone 4s can support the same versions of iOS as the iPhone 6 (see supported devices and Apple's iOS 8 information - see screenshot below from here) and both will run the forthcoming iOS 9, so it shouldn't be a problem restoring a backup from the latter onto the former. \n\nI've done something similar, restoring an iOS 8.x iPhone 6 Plus backup onto an iPhone 5 and had no problems.\n", "Q: Trying to restore Time Machine. Lost boot disk I just bought a new Macbook Air after giving mine to my wife.  Before gifting the old laptop I created a Time Machine backup.  \nNow that I have my new MBAir, I went into Apple+R and chose to restore a Time Machine Backup.  Chose my backup, chose the Macintosh HD as the destination drive.  It failed.  \nNow, subsequent attempts have not shown Macintosh HD as a choice for restoration destination. It is also not a choice when trying to choose a start up disk.\nHowever it does show up in Disk Utility.  \nBoot attempts without holding Apple+R take me to the same OSX Utilities Page.  \nIt seems that I lost my Macintosh HD....  \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Depending on how old the original MBA is compared to the new one, you probably won't be able to do a bare metal restore.\nWhat you can do, is do a fresh OS install (if not done already) and \"Migrate Your Settings\" from the Time Machine Backup.\n", "Q: Does iphone have an activity/ diagnostic log Don't know whats going on ...

The impression is that i got a call without actually getting it. \nI suspect one application, but have no proof its the one. \nIs there an activity log i can take a look to see what happens when it happens?\n\nA: Yes, but it's just a crash log...\nSettings > Privacy > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostic & Usage Data\nHowever, my experience is that it's more likely that your headphones have a fault in the cable or inline remote or dirt in your headphone jack or dock connector (pre-iPhone 5) which is causing it to pause randomly.\nThis is very common, especially if the headphones don't sit fully into the jack because of lint at the bottom.\n", "Q: Connect MacBook Pro to two external monitors Is there a way to connect my MacBook Pro to two external monitors (either VGA or HDMI; no Thunderbolt) in such a way that the Mac screen serves as a third monitor?\nWhat hardware do I need?\n\nA: To get a three screen setup (two external screens, and laptop screen) connected without daisy chaining Thunderbolt displays, you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*One external monitor hooked up to the Mini DisplayPort\n\n*One external monitor hooked up from USB to DVI\n\n\nI am assuming you already have the first item taken care of as it is the easiest.  So, let's focus on the second one:\nYou need something like the Diamond BVU195 HD USB 2.0 to VGA / DVI / HDMI Adapter.  This will give you your \"display adapter\" for your second external monitor.\nNow, you would set your primary monitor the same way you would in a dual monitor setup.   This article from OS X Daily details it nicely.\nWhen you disconnect, as was mentioned in one of the comments above, your main display will revert back to the laptop screen.\nThat's it.  You're done.  But if you want to see this working, check out this YouTube Video.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: Yes, there is a way, in fact I have my rMBP connected to a monitor right now via HDMI.\nFirstly, I suggest HDMI, because that's what I have and it works well for me. :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the Macbook (from now on, MB) to the monitors.\n\n*Open up System Preferences.\n\n*Select Displays (2nd row, 1st item).\n3a. You will be greeted with a window for each monitor\n\n\n\n*Select Arrangement for the MB window (2nd tab)\n\n*Turn off Mirror Displays \n5a.

From the command line, I would like to compress some database dumps using the LZMA algorithm. And, OSX adds XZ support (written in October of last year), claims\n\" It turns out the XZ support in OS X 10.10 is kind of broken. Single‐file XZ file streams like those created by XZ Utils, 7zip, and other popular compression utilities are entirely unsupported . Only XZ files containing a TAR archive are supported. OS X insist that there must be a TAR archive inside XZ files or it will choke on it. \"\nIs this true?  \nI can create a tar archive with LZMA compression as such:\n\n$ tar cfJ dbDumps.tar.xz DbDumps\n\nBut, indeed OSX does not ship with an LZMA executable (as far as I understand). I learned in the Linux & Unix forum that I could use \"Homebrew\" or \"MacPorts\" to get an LZMA executable, but I've not done this yet because I want my Mac as stable as possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*So, is there a way for me, from a command shell, to compress non-tar files using the LZMA algorithm without having to add custom apps from HomeBrew, MacPorts, etc.? (I cannot use a gui to perform the compression.)\n\n\nA: XZ support on macOS isn't broken, it's just restricted to tar. :-)\nThere is nothing to worry about using Homebrew though. Head over to brew.sh to get started and then run brew install xz to install the xz binary.\n", "Q: Am I allowed to use an apple device from placeit.net with an app screenshot on Twitter?

No bolds, italics, fonts, or big/small sizes. Is there any such feature?\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no clear formatting option or shortcut, however you can copy and paste the formatting of selected text.\nFor example if you have a note open with normal formatting, even just opening a new note and typing hello, press Command + Option + C to copy the default normal formatting, then select the note you want to clear and press Command + Option + V to paste that formatting over the text (i.e. clear the formatting).\nAlso as a point of note, typically you only get these issues from copying and pasting from a formatted document. You can avoid this by using Paste and Match Style which is Command + Shift + Option + V\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: MacBook unibody 2010 will not charge reliably I have a 2010 MacBook unibody (the white one, not the Pro) and I have been having all sorts of trouble with it. While I have most of the other problems figured out, there is one that keep persisting and I've tried everything I can think of (or find) to fix it: \n\n\n*\n\n*the MacBook will not charge reliably. \n\n\nIt will charge for about a week, then it quits working and dies and I can't use it for a few days.

If there is enough power left to boot you could go to the Apple Menu > About this Mac > System Report > Power > AC Charger Information and have a look if it recognises the charger, and check the battery health.\nIf this isn't an option because the battery is flat, or health is good and the charger isn't recognised. Then sadly you are going to have to leave the house.\n", "Q: Change System password When I set up my new macbook pro, I chose to use my apple store username / password. However, the password is a pretty long one, and it's annoying to have to type it in every time I need to change a program, run something as root, etc.\nHow can I set a simpler \"local\" password to use without resetting my apple ID?\n\nA: It depends on how you setup your computer, if you set your computer to use your iCloud password to login then you'll need to unlike this. The best way to check is to follow the process for resetting the password as if your computer was using the traditional 'local' login method...\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple logo in the top left of the screen.\n\n*Click System Preferences\n\n*Select Users & Groups\n\n*Select the User account (if there is more than one) from the left of the screen.\n\n*Click the Change Password button.\n\n\nAt this point it should indicate you are using iCloud or not, if not then simply enter your existing password and carefully pick a new one.\nOtherwise, it should give you an option to disassociate and use local login instead, and you'll be able to create a new local password.\n", "Q: master reset on phone I had a iPhone that was in my ex boyfriend's name he took it from me before I could erase any of my contents out of it.\nI asked him to do it and he won't. Now he is calling people I had saved on the phone.\nCan I do a master reset on the phone without having the phone so he will stop harassing people that is stored in the phone?\nI have tried to contact the Verizon store but they said nothing can be done.\n\nA: If it is still signed into your Apple ID and has Find My Phone enabled, erase it via iCloud: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2701\n\nA: That sounds like a sticky situation...\nYou might be able to wipe the phone if your phone had Find My iPhone enabled in iCloud.\nYou'll need to go to http://icloud.com and login, then select Find My iPhone and from there see if your iPhone is listed.\nHere you can lock the phone to prevent him using it, or Erase everything on it.\nIf you didn't do this there is nothing more you can do other than contact the police about his behaviour.\n\nA: And you won't ever be able to access your old phone?

My question is where can I find a working URL for downloading either the GPG Suite or gpgtools for Apple's Leopard 10.5.8 OS X. The processor is Intel based and if you have another recommendation other than GnuPG projects be my guest, I really just need a PGP compliant program that can encrypt and decrypt files with PKI support.\n\nA: The fact that your system is on Leopard rather than Snow Leopard (10.6) will make things a bit trickier. A fair amount of software is only compatible with 10.6 and above.\nThat said, I'd suggest installing GnuPG using one of the UNIX package managers for Mac OS. I see MacPorts still has a legacy installer for Leopard - see this link. \nUnfortunately there doesn't seem to be a binary for 10.5, only 10.6, so you'll need to build it from source, which the MacPorts port command will manage for you.\n", "Q: 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display + Adobe Creative Cloud Purchased a 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display.  It came with 4GB of RAM and 128GB HD. Got it yesterday, and now I discover that you cannot upgrade the RAM to 8 or 16GB.  I need to run Adobe Creative Cloud programs from time to time.  Will these programs run too slow? Should I send it back?\n\nA: It's pretty trivial to open Activity Monitor and look at the RAM usage.\nWhen the graph is in RED - you will have significant slowdowns and really need to take immediate action if you require performance from all the apps running. Usually a restart will let you know if the applications you run have memory leaks and need you to quit them often, log out often, restart the OS often. Or if those apps always use a lot of RAM memory and you should either find more efficient applications to do the same work or run less apps at once or find a Machine with more RAM (assuming your Mac doesn't allow user-upgradeable RAM).\nWhen the graph is in yellow - you're unlikely to be able to measure slow downs, but it's a signal to quit any apps you don't need (email, web browsers with dozens (or more) tabs open, social media, music streaming apps, chat apps (cough slack, cough) and let the system focus all resources to the main apps you need.\nWhen the graph is in green - no worries about RAM being what's causing your workflow to not run at full speed. The constraints you have at that point are network, CPU, or just the apps aren't making use of the machine resources at all and need to be redesigned / updated.)\n\nA: I checked out the system requirements for one of their \"heavy duty\" applications (Photoshop CC).  The minimum is 2GB of RAM, but they recommend 8GB.\nSo, your application will work and should work \"fairly well.\"  But given that Adobe is recommending 8, the experience wont be great.  In my experience, if they recommend 8GB, you should have 16GB\nSince you just bought your rMBP, as was said earlier, now is the time to swap it out, not 3 to 6 months from now when you realize that you should have bought the one with 8GB of RAM\n\nA: As an additional but of info, the 13 inch MBP is what you would call an entry level system. It does a lot and does it well but it was never meant to be a heavy lifting design machine. \nThe graphics card is one factor. I don't buy a Mac laptop unless it has a separate card and processor. The reason being that the Intel graphics card shares a lot of resources with the rest of the computer so if you are working on a large size file, Illustrator, for instance, will need ram and processor time to render fonts and images while OS X needs those same resources for disk access, background processes and the like. \nAll that has to sit somewhere and that somewhere is the ram. Think of ram like a workable. You have a small amount of ram and you have a small amount of workspace. More ram, bigger table. \n", "Q: iPad Mini 3 - Removing standard built-in apps How can I remove the built-in music app from my iPad, or at least remove the icon.\n My daughter uses the iPad and I don't want her to have access to some of the music and radio stations.\n\nA: You cannot uninstall or hide the default Apple apps.\nYou can set up Restrictions [parental controls] to prevent access to particular apps or age-related content.\nWord of warning - don't forget the passcode or you'll have to wipe the phone & start over.\nSettings > General > Restrictions.

Apologies in advance if this has been answered.\nWhat is the exact procedure to reset Net-SNMP to \"factory defaults\" on, say, OSX 10.10 - or any other OSX flavor?\nA number of our Xserves were upgraded from 10.6 to 10.8 to 10.9 or 10.10 and in the process appear to have their Net-SNMP executables and/or configuration corrupted - e.g. snmpd daemons crashing frequently, not reporting CPU/mem loads, etc. Tried comparing folder structures between affected and unaffected nodes and haven't gotten too far.\nEdit: just to be clear, this isn't about snmpd.conf - but about snmp executables, MIBs and what not.\nAppreciate any ideas!\n\nA: The canonical method to reset a net-snmp installation to factory defaults in Mac OS X (there's no difference between client & server in this case) is:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.net-snmp.snmpd.plist\nsudo cp /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.default /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf\nsudo rm /usr/share/snmpd.conf\nsudo rm -rf /var/db/net-snmp\n\nThis resets the snmpd.conf file to the default & clears out any added users and instance data. This should be valid back to 10.6 or so, possibly earlier, but I'm not sure.\nIn 10.11.x Apple updated the net-snmp version from 5.6 to 5.6.2.1 which may cause some issues.\n\nA: After recent OSX upgrades (10.9 and 10.10 desktop versions, not OSX Server, behaviour might be different) I usually control Net-SNMP configuration in two different places:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf which should contain your configuration but sometimes get replaced by the default one from OSX\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.net-snmp.snmpd.plist which can disable snmpd launch (look at the Disabled key)\n\n\nI've never seen anything else being replaced (executables, libraries, etc.).\nFrom 10.6 to 10.10 the Net-SNMP version used might be quite different, so you'll also need to double check your snmpd.conf file to see if all directives are still valid.  The snmpconf utility might come handy, have a look at its man page.\n", "Q: Is beta.apple.com running on Rails? The error page is standard Rails error page, and the web server uses Phusion Passenger on Apache.\nI guess it's probably running on Ruby on Rails? Very unexpected from Apple.\n\n\nA: Yes, according to builtwith it is running rails.\n", "Q: How can I inform Apple what I dislike in their app and how it can be visible for others? I do not like some thing in Apple Music and I would like to tell them about this. How can I share this to other people and in same time inform Apple about this?\n\nA: How about their associated Facebook and Twitter accounts?\n\nA: You could submit an issue to \"Apple Bug Reporter\"\nEven though it's called \"Bug Reporter\" you can also use it to submit enhancements, suggestions, feature requests, UI/usability issues, etc.\nTo sign in you need an Apple ID which you probably have anyway.\nIn a way you also \"share this to other people\" in this way, because if other people submit similar issues to Bug Reporter it can be linked to your issue, so that they know someone else reported something similar already.\n\nA: Apple Music does not yet have a \"feedback page\" but you could try to\nuse the iPhone or iPad feedback or iTunes feedback pages since Music is integrated into the whole ecosystem.  Each of the pages says that they read all the feedback. Go to the main feedback page and choose the product that you are primarily using Music with and submit your feedback there.\n", "Q: Issues creating Bootable USB for EL Capitan Public beta I'm trying to follow tutorial over at: http://osxdaily.com/2015/06/11/make-bootable-os-x-el-capitan-beta-install-usb-drive/\nto create bootable usb for El Capitan Public Beta, however after completion I get this error in console: \nMount of outer dmg failed.\n\nI tried running\nhdiutil verify /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Public\\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\nAnd it returned:\nhdiutil: verify: unable to recognize \"/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan Public Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\" as a disk image. (image not recognized)\nhdiutil: verify failed - image not recognized\n\nI'm not sure why. I downloaded beta installer and it launched correctly. It sits in Applications folder.\n\nA: I tried many things talked about here and on other top Google searches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Redownloaded (three times)\n\n*Tried moving the .app to Desktop\n\n*Changed permissions of .app\n\n*Verified the .dmg with hdiutil\n\n*Used different Mac\n\n\nEventually got it to work by using a different USB flash drive. My original USB was a 16 GB Kingston, the second I tried that also didn't work was a 8 GB Lexar. The third and final one that did not get the \"mount of outer dmg failed\" error is a PNY 8 GB.\nFor reference I used the command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Public\\ Beta.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Public\\ Beta.app --nointeraction\n\nA: I was having this too.  I finally had success by copying the install app/folder from /Applications to the desktop.  Once there the \"mount of outer dmg\" message was no more, despite using the same command (other than the appropriate path changes).  Might not be the solution for everyone, but it did work for me.  \n\nA: The only way I was able to get it to work with my SanDisk Extreme 64GB was to format using 'Apple Partition Map' instead of 'GUID Partition Map' before running createinstallmedia.\n\nA: What you're trying to do is verify the integrity of the electronic software delivery (ESD) image. But you somehow got it wrong, it should look as follows:\nhdiutil verify /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Public\\ Beta.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\n\nFor me the integrity is checked ok, still I have the same error as you:\nMount of outer dmg failed\n\nA: For me it was a permission issue. I copied it to Desktop and ran this command and it fixed the problem:\nsudo chown yourusername -Rv ~/Desktop/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan\\ Public\\ Beta.app\n\nCopying to Desktop might not even be needed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Redownloaded 2 times\n\n*Tried a different mac\n\n*Tried changing the format to Apple Partition Map\nNone of these worked, I am going to try DiskMaker and keep my fingers crossed. If you have any suggestions just post them. Also can some one please post the code to install it from a location on the desktop not the Applications folder.

But then I did a safe boot and again everything was normal. Then after 3 days again random restarts, safe booted and everything was fine then finally after 3 days it randomly restarted and didn't boot. Mean while o had installed el Capitan beta 1 on another partion. Then I installed Yosemite on a SD card from my friends Mac book and booted from it on my Mac. Everything seemed fine. I backed up data and reinstalled osx on it. Till today everything was fine of reinstallation of osx when suddenly I restarted. I tried to do a safe boot and restart but after safe boot when I clicked restart while restarting it would show a prohibitory sign then the apple logo then again the prohbitory sign and again apple logo and again prohibitory sign and apple logo with loading bar but it won't boot into my main hard disk bit into the El Capitan partion and even if I try to hold option while booting and select main disk it does the same dance and boots into El Capitan. What should I do?\n\nA: You did a lot of installing of operating systems including installing a beta version of an operating system; which, by the way, is not in any way an accepted method to diagnose issues.  \nHowever, I noticed you never addressed the single causality that probably is the issue:\n\nI upgraded my ram about three months ago and then it had random\n  restarts,\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried resetting you NVRAM?\n\n*Have you tried removing the RAM you installed?\n\n\nThose would be the first two steps I would take before I embark on a OS installation and re-installation journey.\n\nA: My first thought would be that you pull the drive, put it in an enclosure and try to reformat it from another system. \nOr just get a new drive and try installing fresh. \nThe other issue could be bad ram assuming you checked the ram you bought was fully compatible. I did but knockoff ram once that said it was all good but turned out not to be. \n", "Q: Where does OS X get defaults from in Guest User Web access Parental Controls? I did not put these here, I don't know where they came from. WHOIS by IP seems to indicate they are from Amsterdam? (149.154.175.50 copy-pastable for anyone who wants to check)\n\n\nA: Using online tools it appears that as of this date/time that is a hard coded IP address from the app called Telegram or Telegram Messenger.   \nWhy it's hard coded into the app as IP address doesn't make sense, but it seems to be where it is coming from.\n", "Q: If you put a Mac in Lost Mode while FileVault is enabled, does it prevent OS X reinstalls? Apple's documentation on Lost Mode doesn't say a whole lot about what the finder of the Mac will be able to (or unable to) do with it. Especially if FileVault is enabled.\nFor example, if I lose my Mac while it is powered on with plenty of battery remaining, they'll see a lock screen and it probably won't connect to wifi unless they happen to be in a place with a known WiFi network (highly unlikely). That means the lock is unlikely to occur, and they're unlikely to ever see the lock message.\nHowever, if they attempt an erase and restore, won't Disk Utility prevent them from erasing the volume since it'll be locked with the passwords of the accounts?\nI suppose, theoretically, the only way for Lost Mode to actually do any good is if they figure out how to delete the volume in spite of the FileVault lock, install OS X, and then upon getting online have Apple lock it out during OS X activation?\n\nA: Filevault prevents the theft of data not the device. If they boot to recovery partition or jump drive they can wipe and reinstall and your data is still safe. if you want to prevent that from happening you need to add a firmware password. So this would be the best combo \n\n\n*\n\n*filevault\n\n*firmware password\n\n*lost mode\n\n\nhowever if they know what they are doing they can still open the machine and take it from there. \nThere is no 100% fool proof way other keeping your mac with you \n", "Q: Apple Music and Playlists Maybe I'm missing something here, but my playlist created on my iPhone is not showing up on my iPad. \nBoth are up to date, even running on the same network. You would think this would be stored on the cloud, not locally. \n\nA: I think this is a feature not a bug. different devices you may want to have different playlists for . However that's just my opinion. On the other hand I think if you sync your iPhone and iPad to the same machine and have them both sync all playlists then you should be good to go. However you will have do sync them both all the time to keep them synced lol . Another opinion here. I agree with you.

Is there any documentation or first hand experiences as to what constitutes significant changes to an app when submitting a new TestFlight build that has already passed beta review? \nApple asks: \"Have you made any significant changes to this build since your previous submission?\"\nWe added some in app purchases which turn on/off some features but those features already existed in previous submission so maybe this change isn't \"significant\".\n\nA: Significant changes would be adding a new code SDK, new advertising, new IAP purchases - basically anything that isn't just a little change to some refactoring or some new cosmetic changes.\nIf you are changing tens of lines of code and tens of classes - that seems minor unless your code base is extremely small.\n", "Q: Multiple Bluetooth speakers simultaneously I would like to pair two sticky dude Bluetooth speakers, at one time with my iPhone. With two of them at once it would be like stereo sound. Is there an app or something maybe? \n\nA: You cannot use the same Bluetooth device profile with more than one deivce at the same time.  You won't be able to do what you want to do.\nFor a listing of all the different profiles, see this Wikipedia entry.\nBut I can have multiple Bluetooth devices paired to my iPhone.  I have a keyobard, a headset and speakers.\nEach uses a different profile.  Your keyboard is considered an HID (Human Inteface Device) while your headset uses the HSP profile and your audio (speakers) likely uses the A2DP profile.\nThese profiles are 1-1.  Meaning one profile to one device at a time.\nIf you want stereo get a stereo receiver that supports Bluetooth.\n\nA: The new iOS (and iPadOS) audio-sharing feature uses Bluetooth to split audio between two different devices. Specific requirements change depending on which sharing method you use (more on that in a bit), but both users will need a pair of AirPods or Powerbeats Pro wireless earphones, as well as one of the following devices (running iOS or iPadOS 13):\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 13: iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, or XS Mini; or an iPod Touch (seventh-generation).\n\n*iPadOS 13: iPad Pro 11-inch; iPad Pro 12.9-inch (second-generation or later); iPad Air (third-generation); iPad mini (fifth-generation).\n\n\nThe final iOS/iPadOS 13 release will also allow users to share audio by syncing up two sets of Bluetooth headphones to a single handset.\n\n\n*\n\n*Put both pairs of Bluetooth headphones into pairing mode (this varies by model—check your user manual or do a quick internet search if you don’t know how to do this).\n\n*On the iOS/iPadOS 13 device you wish to use for playback, go to Settings > Bluetooth\n\n*Tap the names of each unpaired device to connect both headphones.\n\n*Both headphones will now play the same audio simultaneously, but volume and playback can only be controlled on the iPhone/iPad.\n\n", "Q: Why is my HD full of nothing? \nI'm running 10.8.\nEverything is updated.\nTried all the usual memory recovery stuff and resets. Disabled time machine.\nWhen I look at at the HD folders in terminal, with show all sizes all the files only total about 110GB (including hidden files)\nThe only thing unusual about this computer is that it has a ton (~100) of users that are managed with parental controls. Not sure if that would affect this issue. Also, because it would take so long to manually reenter all these users I'm hesitant to wipe it and reinstall everything.\nAny ideas before I wipe it and start over? Thanks.\n\nA: Two things. \n\n\n*\n\n*The spotlight process that catalogs files has stopped (perhaps due to low disk space) so they yellow information is incorrect. It should show you a warning IMO that the catalog process failed or needs to update. The \"Other\" is a catch-all so you're seeing that.\n\n*Copy 20 GB of files to an external drive (photo library, movies, virtual machines are easy targets) and then delete them. You can use Finder to show folder sizes and locate some targets. At that point, restart into Recovery and repair the drive and volume using Disk Utility.\nThen boot the system normally and let the system run for several hours to see what really is using space. Once you have a good reading, you can add files back from the backup. Your wipe and start over is fine too. Maybe let the system stabilize and show realistic data before restoring your user account and settings/files.\nSee these for more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is it important to keep lots of freespace on OSX?

Resetting the router, changing the channel number and band. \nThe internet connection is fine, and then just hangs for a minute or 2, then returns to normal. \nThe wifi icon remains connected, and I have the latest 10.10.4 update installed. At first I thought it was a DNS bug with Yosemite, and have played with the settings such as changing DNS provider, changing the IPV6 to IPV4 only etc.\nDriving me nuts. Has anyone had a similar problem? I've checked the surroundings with wifi scanners and have chosen the best channel available.  \n\n\n*\n\n*One thing I have noticed, it seems a lot more reliable on 5GHz as opposed to 2.4Ghz\n\n*It seems to affect my Macbook Pro Retina 13in Early 2015 a lot more than the other devices on the network.\n\n*I'm using a Virginmedia Superhub 1. \n\n\nA: I have been experiencing the same issue of wifi dropping in and out since upgrading to Yosemite on my MacBook Pro 13\" with retina display (early 2014). Having read many discussions, the answer that solved this for me was to use the terminal command:\nsudo ifconfig awdl0 down\n\nBy disabling AirDrop, which I never use the wifi connection on my Virgin Media SuperHub 2 appears to be stable. All other devices, iPhones, iPads etc were not affected by the issue, so I believe it is something in the code for Yosemite to do with how wifi is managed that causes this issue. I am hopeful that El Capitan will have a different / resolved bit of code for this.\n\nA: Ok I've got to the bottom of this. It was my router. I have now upgraded from a Virginmedia Superhub VMDG480 to the latest Superhub 2ac. Its been over a week now and the connection is solid, so I'm answering this myself. \nTheir latest kit has concurrent 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz, which I think has resulted in a more robust connection overall. Considering there where three phones, a media server, 3 computers, two tablets, a printer and an Xbox on at any one time, I just don't think the 2010 kit could hack it. Not to mention the extremely crowded 2.4Ghz band in my area.\nI think the reason it seemed to affect my Macbook more than other devices is that, after testing against other devices, the wifi reception doesn't seem as sensitive as other devices, meaning, it dropped the connection a lot more than devices at the same range. As a side note, my Galaxy Tab 8.4 Pro seems to have super robust wifi reception in comparison with the Mac.\n\nA: Ah, have this issue too.\nI must say though, when I purchased a new router and made the SuperHub in a modem, that's when it works the most. I still get the internet drop everyone and then. In fact, here is one proof.\n\nThe terminal window above is pinging google and the one below is pinging the router I purchased and plugged to the SuperHub(now acting as a modem). While at the point of this screenshot, the internet was down. Other computer connected to the same router, the internet was on and they experienced no internet drop. Which is very odd. \nBut that being said, getting the router and making the SuperHub did make me have the internet 4 out of 5 times, as opposed to 1 out of 5 times when connected directly to the SuperHub's wireless (2 or 5 GHz).\nHere you'll see the internet suddenly decided to come back up, while responses from the router below was still consistent.\n\nAnd this only happens on the MacBook Pro, no other system on the network (iMac). Still puzzle. \nI am yet to try reseting SMC etc. But as a good solution, I would recommend getting a router and using the SuperHub 2 in modem mode - if you are still having problems i.e. --Basically, I made the SuperHub 2  work in modem mode (which switches of its routing function and makes it just a cable modem). And got another router to do the job providing the wireless signal needed\n\nA: I was having a similiar issue with 10.10.3 which was not corrected when I updated to 10.10.4. Many, many things were tried before I got it to stay connected to WiFi reliably, however deleting the networking PLIST files seems to be what finally did it.\nThe Fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable WiFi\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Press Cmd+Shft+G to go to the folder /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\n\n*Delete (or move) the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n*NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*preferences.plist\n\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Re-enable WiFi\n\n\nThe Other Things I Tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Used Onyx to clear caches, run update scripts, etc.\n\n*Disabled AirDrop by using Terminal to run sudo ifconfig awdl0 down\n\n*Kext Utility to reset kext permissions, followed by...\n\n*Disk Utility to verify/correct permissions. \n\n\n*\n\n*In my case errors were found, and I had to...\n\n*Reboot in Recovery Mode (press Cmd+R as boot sound, hold until you see the Apple logo), use Disk Utility, however no errors were detected\n\n*Disabled FileVault, waited for decryption to complete\n\n*Reboot in Recovery Mode, use Disk Utility, some errors corrected then return value 8 and was told I had to backup, format, and restore to the drive.\n\n*Ran Disk Utility repair again and no errors were detected (then I ran it again for good measure)\n\n*Rebooted and Disk Utility found no errors.\n\n*Still had WiFi disconnects...\n\n\n*Deleted the AirPort plist files (fix above) and WiFi has been stable.\n\n\nA: Wi-Fi dropping and losing Internet connection are two totally separate things.\nIf your Wi-Fi drops, you lose connectivity to everything on your network.  If your Internet drops, you only lose connection to the outside world, your internal network is still good.\nBelow is a general picture of a home network with Intenet.\n\n(The cable modem used here can also be a DSL router, a fiber connection, or any other high speed connection, this explanation isn't limited to cable modems)\nIf the connection between the Cable Modem and the Internet dropped, you would still be able to communicate with all the other devices on the the network itself.  For instance, you would still be able to print a document or stream music to your entertainment console from your iTunes library on your computer.\nFirst, let's determine if it is your Wi-Fi or your Internet.\nGet your IP address and the IP address of your router.  Under Settings --> Network, you will see your IP and Router. (I am using Ethernet here, but it is exactly the same for Wi-Fi)\n\nIn this case, my router's IP is 192.168.10.1\nTesting the Wi-Fi connection.\nIf your Wi-Fi drops, first it will appear disconnected (red or yellow dot) like mine is in the picture.  You can also try and ping the router.\nIn Terminal, type the following command:\nping -c 5 <your router IP>\nping -c 5 192.168.10.1   <-------- Example using my IP\n\nYou should see results that look like (the top half) of the picture below.  If it fails, it will look like the bottom half with the \"Request timeout\" error\n\nIf it's successful, then your network is working.  If not, then there is a problem with either your Wi-Fi adapter or with your modem/router iteself\nIf it's working, trying pinging Google or one of the public DNS Servers.  Enter the following in Terminal:\nping -c 5 www.google.com    <----- This should work, but if DNS is failing, try the next line\nping -c 5 4.4.4.4 <------ If you can't hit this, your connection to the internet is failing\n\nIf it fails now, then your Internet is not working and that will require a service call to your provider.\nOne other thing you can try is connecting an Ethernet cable directly to the router/modem and disabling your Wi-Fi.  If you no longer have drops in service, we will know that you have an issue with Wi-Fi.  It could still be either your computer or the router/modem, but we will know what is working and what is not.\nHow can we tell if it is a Wi-Fi issue with either the router/modem or with your iMac?\nThis is where another device comes in.  If you have an iPhone or another computer or a tablet, check to see if you have connectivity when your computer's connection drops.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't then it is the router/modem.  Time for a service call with your service provider\n\n*If you do, then chances are it's your computer.  More diagnostics and checking of settings, but time to setup up an appointment with Apple service.\n\n\nA: The same thing happens to me! I don't know how to permanently solve this problem, however, but I find that turning Wifi off then on will solve the issue. This is only temporary though, because it always seems to drop the Wifi once every while.\n\nA: I have had the same problem. What seemed to work for me was deleting all the WiFi networks I had saved on my system in the 'Preferred Networks' list in settings, network, wifi, advanced. Then just re-joining the network i needed again. \n\nA: I tried all the solutions here, and nothing fixed the WiFi dropping. \nThe solution that worked for me was buying the WiFi cable as I read in this post: http://warrantyvoidifremoved.blogspot.com/2014/01/repairing-intermittent-wifiwireless-on.html\nI was quite sure the problem was the cable because I tried a workaround to \"protect\" the cable. I put two coins in both sides of the cable to avoid that cable enter in contact with the button cover of the macbook... And the WiFi stopped working completely after a few attempts. That's how I was quite sure the cable was not OK. I toke a photo of the macbook and coins to remember!\n\nBy the way. I bought that cable by around 14€ here: https://www.ebay.es/itm/Macbook-Pro-A1286-2011-2012-821-1311-A-Wifi-Bluetooth-Airport-Card-Cable-New/172242614579?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649\nIn my macbook pro early 2011 15\", the cable was very easy to change.

I'm tempted to just close it and retry, but I'm not sure if doing so will mess anything up.\n\nA: I don't think closing the window \"messes up\" anything.\nEither your Apple ID is created, or it's not!\nCheck if you can login using your Apple ID in related services like iTunes Store. If you can't login, then there was an error on Apple's side and you can repeat the process again. On the other hand, if you can login, then your Apple ID is already created and ready to use.\nThe reason this kind of problems happen is mostly because of poor error handling. My best guess is timeout error which is very common, but the application (Mail.app in this case) doesn't know how to properly handle the error (and notify the user).\nIn your case, something caused the server's response (whether it be success or error) to not reach you, but the client side, is still waiting for server's response.\n", "Q: Where is the \"Free on iTunes\" link? Is \"Free on iTunes\" gone again?\nI'm unable to find the \"Free on iTunes\" link from the iOS app. I have seen no announcements nor news that \"Free on iTunes\" was going to be removed. How do I locate this link (if it's still available)?\n\nA: On an iPhone, you're right it's currently missing even on 8.3. Perhaps an oversight. On iPad, it's ok. Open up the iTunes Store, it's in the footer for Music:\n\n", "Q: Will my old messages appear on a newly synced apple device? If I sync my icloud to another apple device, such as an iPad - Will the messages that are already on my iPhone appear on the iPad or will it only be newly received or outgoing messages that appear? \nAlso if it is the case that my messages on my iPhone already will appear, will texts that I have deleted from the iPhone appear on the iPad once synced. \nHope that makes some sense!\n\nA: \"synced\" can mean differnt things and is slightly ambiguous.  \nHowever if you \"backup\" your phone via iCloud or iTunes, then you can restore the backup to another device and your iMessages and SMS texts will have been transfered.   \nMore info here: iCloud: iCloud storage and backup overview\n", "Q: OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite, has the default PATH changed? Today I had to configure a new macbook, running 10.10.3 out of the box and immediately upgraded to 10.10.4.\nAfter installing homebrew I went to configure the default PATH, and opened /etc/paths.\nI found that it contained:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nthat is, /usr/local/bin is at the top. This is not what I was expecting, and what I know should be the default.\nHas the default changed? I reviewed the Homebrew installation script, and it doesn't seem to change /etc/paths. I also stat'ed the file, and it doesn't seem to have been changed.\nSo, is this the new default PATH order in OS X?\n\nA: My /etc/paths has the same content on 10.10.4 and has a timestamp of \"Sep  9  2014\" so it has been like that for quite some time now.\nBasically it makes sense to place /usr/local/bin on top because that way binaries installed locally take precedence over the standard versions.\n", "Q: How do I get the location of a locked file in Preview? I used to be able to Right-click or Command-click the name of the file in the title bar and see the path, whether the file was locked or not. Now when I open an attachment from Outlook (yes, I know it's in the Outlook temp folder - I just shouldn't have to manually navigate there), I can't actually open that folder from the Preview window.\nWhen I try this method on an unlocked file, such as one on the Desktop, or in my Documents folder, it succeeds. So far, I can only see that the locked state is at issue.\nI saw on another answer to a similar question they referred to ensuring View > Show Path Bar was selected - but that's not an option in my version of Preview.\nAny ideas?\nAdditional info: I reviewed the updates I've recently installed, and I think the behavior changed after I installed the most recent Xcode update (v6.4) a few days ago (I doubt that iMovie, OneNote or HP Printer software updates were involved).

When you go to a contact, you can see if that contact has FaceTime.\nHow does the system determine this capability?\nThe usual way that other systems like WhatsApp do it is by uploading/synchronizing your entire address book to the operator's cloud servers, or at least phone numbers / mail addresses (some promise not to save it, but still upload for checking, like TextSecure by Twitter).\nDoes iOS send your contacts to Apple, especially when you enable FaceTime?\nI know it does if you enable iCloud sync, or Siri \"for better recognition\", as they say, but maybe just using iOS by itself without iCloud already means it will be shared with Apple services.\n\nA: In some instances, yes.  In the Apple privacy policy breakdown, available here, you can see that Apple indicates your contacts are sent to their servers when using Siri:\n\nThe longer you use Siri and Dictation, the better they understand you and the better they work. To help them recognize your pronunciation and provide better responses, certain information such as your name, contacts, and songs in your music library is sent to Apple servers using encrypted protocols.\n\nHowever, and this is an important point, all the data is encrypted.  Further in that same policy statement is this:\n\nThat said, Siri and Dictation do not associate this information with your Apple ID, but rather with your device through a random identifier. Apple Watch uses the Siri identifier from your iPhone. You can reset that identifier at any time by turning Siri and Dictation off and back on, effectively restarting your relationship with Siri and Dictation. When you turn Siri and Dictation off, Apple will delete the User Data associated with your Siri identifier, and the learning process will start all over again.\n\nSo you have the ability to control what info is sent to Apple, how they use it, as well as being able to reset your unique identifier.  \nI would strongly suggest you visit the Apple privacy policy site to get a better understanding of what data is sent to Apple and how they use it.  You can compare this to other mobile companies to see which one takes better care of your data.  I think it's great that you're interested in the privacy of your data.  It's also great that some companies put this info our there for everyone to see while others don't.\n", "Q: AirPort Extreme is disconnected from the internet when in bridge mode I have to use the router provided by my ISP to connect to the internet, but I also want to use my AirPort Extreme.\nDHCP is set to on in the ISP's router. When I connect the router to the AirPort, and set the AirPort to DHCP and NAT, it seems to work fine, but it also says Double NAT.\nSo I found out that I needed to turn off one of the DHCP servers, and decided to put the AirPort Extreme to Bridge mode. But when I do that, I get no internet connection. In the AirPort Utility, the Internet light is yellow and it says connection disconnected. It also shows the DNS servers as 192.168.1.1 which I guess is the router's IP address.\nWhy does this happen? What could be causing the problem?\n\nA: This is not a real solution, but it might help if you have the same issue.\nI still get the problem, and every time I get it, I restart the AirPort Extreme (by unplugging it from the outlet, waiting a bit, and plugging it back), and it works (until it stops working again).

Is there anything else I can do to reclaim my missing 36 GB of space?\n\nA: You said you don't want to wipe the phone and reset it, but what about restoring it from a backup? During an iCloud restore, iOS re-downloads most of what it needs from Apple’s servers, so the process might reclaim your lost space, since iOS wouldn’t assign it to anything that isn't actually using it. After the restore, your phone would be returned to the same state you left it in.\n\nA: Instead of restoring from a backup, one might want to try logging out of iCloud and back in again.  For me, that fixed a lot of unexplained occupied space.\nFurthermore, if you're looking for a possible explanation in your case, in a different question it was suggested that iTunes Match could be the reason.

I would like to create patches in Mainstage that select a bank (I-A to I-G and U-A to U-G) on the M3. In Mainstage, you can send a bank select command by entering a MSB and LSB in decimal format. However, I only found the MIDI implementation chart for the M3, and I do not have the knowledge to translate that into the decimals for Mainstage. \nI Googled a lot and tried some options, but no bank is selected. A program change does work, so I figured out the MIDI connection should be OK.\nCould anyone help me out with this?\n\nA: Bank select MSB/LSB are just standard Control Change messages.\nMSB is CC 0 & LSB is CC32 - range is 0 - 127, like any other CC.\nVery few devices have what you would consider a 'logical' array of bank numbers; 0, 1, 2, 3 etc, so unless you have a sheet with the banks in Hex or Dec, this is going to be your best method.\nWhich Bank transmits which Bank Select message?\nThe simplest way to find out is to just cheat ;-)\nMake sure your M3 is set to transmit this data - from the M3 Midi Spec sheet...  \n\nNotes *P, *A, *C, *E: Transmitted/received when Global P1: MIDI Filter (Program Change, Aftertouch, Control Change, Exclusive) is Enable, respectively\n\nMake sure your DAW is set to record it - I've never used Mainstage, so you'd have to check the manual.\nSet your DAW to Record, then hit a bank then program. Check for CC 0 & 32 messages.  \nSome devices will transmit the CCs only at the bank change, some will transmit with each program change.\nSome will send values for MSB & LSB, some use only one & send 0 for the other.\nSome require both MSB & LSB before they will change Bank, some only need one. Some don't change until the Program Change message is sent.\nYou'll have to experiment to see which your Korg uses.\nI have a vague recollection Korg sends something on every button-press, so you might have a fair bit of data to wade through.\n\nA: Thank you @Tetsuijn for your feedback. I discovered the M3 only recognizes the back select when combined with a program change. The MSB and LSB for bank select are in fact a logical array:\n\nMSB    LSB    Korg M3 bank\n\n0      0      I-A\n0      1      I-B\n0      2      I-C\n0      3      I-D\n0      4      I-E\n0      5      I-F\n0      6      I-G\n0      7      U-A\n0      8      U-B\n0      9      U-C\n0      10     U-D\n0      11     U-E\n0      12     U-F\n0      13     U-G\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4 screen lock through unsolicited ad On my iPhone 4 A1332 I had a pop-up this morning from daily-offers-online.com\nwhich I could not remove.\nI had no access to Safari until I clicked on the pop-up's OK button (which I did by accident).\nHow would I know if there is (by having done this) any bug/virus installed on my iPhone? …and how could it be removed?\n\nA: It's a JavaScript alert from the page that you're currently viewing. It's not malware or anything installed on the device—just JavaScript.\nTap to dismiss the dialog then leave the advertiser's webpage. It doesn't lock the screen, just presents a modal dialog in front of the content.\n", "Q: Mysterious photo uploads to Google Photos I realise this question is somewhat of an intersection of OS X and Google but I'll start here. My partner discovered that most of her pictures (up to 2013) that are on her Mac were mysteriously available on Google Photos; we're puzzled as to how all these pictures ended up on Google Photos when we did not explicitly upload them.\nWhat mechanisms are available that would automatically sync up photos from OS X? My prime suspect is Google Drive for OS X. We don't appear to have that installed any more and that might explain why the pics only go to 2013.\nWhat other items can we look at? They're not pictures from her phone (iPhone 4, iOS 7) nor have we installed anything on there that might sync pics from her phone.\n\nA: Google + for iOS, Google Photos for iOS and Google Photo Autobackup do that. The age of the pictures is not really relevant, because the last app would upload any image on your computer (on the pictures folders mostly). \nAlso, Picasa used to be able to sync your pics with G+, although I'm not sure it was automatic.\n\nA: In the end it turned out to be a blogger.com blog storing photos in the Google Photos account. We had assumed the blogger account would use it's own photo store. \nBottom line: Google uses Google Photos for general photo storage for many of its services.\n", "Q: Spotify Premium account price on App Store As you may already know, Spotify started sending out emails to its customers to stop subscribing to the Premium account through iOS App Store's In-app Purchase mechanism (which costs $12.99) and subscribe using Spotify website (which costs $9.99).\nThe reason behind this difference is that Apple charges 30% of the purchase price as its noted here. The purchase price of Spotify Premium through App Store is $12.99. But this doesn't make sense to me. 30% of $12.99 is approximately $3.9 so Spotify will be making $9.1 instead of $9.9.\nIs the 30% calculated after the developer states its intended price? i.e. Spotify says that it wants to earn $9.99 with each purchase. Apple says fine, I'll charge $12.99, have $3 (which is 30% of $9.99) for myself and you can have the remaining $9.9. (I don't believe this is the case.)\nOr Spotify is actually selling its Premium account cheaper through App Store? What I mean is that in order to earn $9.99 per purchase, one should charge approximately $14.28.\nCan someone please clarify the situation? Thanks.\n\nA: It's a simple marketing ploy.\nApple Music is $9.99 a month\nSpotify is $12.99 a month, through the Apple Store.\nSpotify want to match Apple's price, but don't want to cut their revenue to 70% of $9.99, so they're offering you $9.99 direct, rather than $12.99 through Apple.\nThat means for every person who changes to the direct method, Spotify actually receive more than they used to through Apple.\n", "Q: Why can't some songs be played with Music? I would like to know why some songs in Apple Music can't get played in an album or in a list and can be played individually.\nI will show how I see some albums:\n\n\nA: It means Apple doesn't have the rights to stream the song to you, whether that be a locale-specific problem or because the song is Album Only on the iTunes Store.\n\nA: I can confirm this \"dimming out\" has nothing to do with your internet, wi-fi, or cellular connection--and for what it's worth, I have seen this in iOS 8.4.1 on my phone and in iTunes 12.2.2.25 on both Mac or PC, both ethernet connected and via wi-fi. \nAlthough I suppose it is possible, it also does not make sense that Apple would not get the rights to certain songs on certain albums; so far, the songs that I haven't been able to play seem completely random.\nFinally, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with songs I own vs. songs I \"borrow\" from Apple Music.  \nBasically, it doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nA: This is what worked for me when Apple Music wouldn't work fully without wifi, not allowing me to listen to most songs.\nGo to the settings app, iTunes & App Store and turn on Use Mobile Data. \nHope this works for your problem!\n\nA: This also could mean that your internet connection is offline or very weak. Apple Music is able to cache recently played songs, and therefore these will be able to play directly from the storage on your device. When the Internet connection becomes stronger, these greeted out songs may be able to be streamed like the other ones.\n\nA: I have recognized that it is not possible to stream those songs on Apple Music, which are marked also as \"Album Only\" in iTunes Store. It seems that it has to do something with rights. It is definitely not a connectivity issue. \n", "Q: How to locate the Power Pads on a MacBook Pro A1398 My mac will no longer power up via the keyboard. I have taken the back off and have it before me with the fans at the bottom and the batteries at the top.\nHow can I jump-start the Mac ?\nI have tried to find the Power Pads but to no avail.\nI have also read about shorting pins #5 and #29 of the keyboard cable but unsure where this is and which pins exactly to short.\nMy question is how to start the Mac using either method above or another.\n\nA: I managed to do this shortly after posting the question. Shorting PIN 5 of the keyboard connector (5th from right with the batteries at the top) with GROUND works. However I could only get it to work with the screen opened. \n"]
